Most Alzheimer's disease symptom-modifying drugs are still aimed at increasing muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.  Originally this receptor was not thought to be present in the brain, only in the periphery. Since Sir Henry Dale's time it was thought that muscarinic receptors were only present in the gut and since Otto Loewi that they are also in the heart, but the brain was not thought of as a site of expression.  However, the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the striatum are rich in the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.  They are receptors comprising seven transmembrane elements and come in five subtypes."]}, {"page": "Sir Arnold Stanley Vincent Burgen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arnold Burgen"]}, {"page": "Sir Arnold Burgen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arnold Burgen"]}]}}
