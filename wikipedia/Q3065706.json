The song recounts lead singer and guitarist Gaz Coombes's experience of being arrested by the police for possession of cannabis. The limited release of vinyl copies sold out quickly, thanks in part to support from John Peel on his Radio One show. The Parlophone label signed the band and re-released the single in the autumn of the same year. It achieved the rare feat of being both NME and Melody Maker's \"Single Of The Week\" status in the same week.", "After three years out of the limelight, the band returned with Life on Other Planets (September 2002), recorded at Heliocentric, Rockfield and Mayfair Studios and produced by Beck collaborator Tony Hoffer. The album was released in the UK on Parlophone, but in the US on the Island Def Jam imprint. The record was not as commercially successful as Supergrass's first three albums, failing to make the Top Three in the UK albums chart. However, the critical response to the album was generally very positive, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic claiming \"The world is a better place for having Supergrass in it.\".[ allmusic ((( Life on Other Planets > Overview )))] It has since gone gold in the UK. Life on Other Planets was also notable as it was the first Supergrass album to recognise Rob Coombes as an official member. For the band's first three albums, Supergrass officially consisted of Gaz Coombes, Goffey and Quinn although Rob Coombes contributed to many of the band's songs and videos, and toured with them. Tracks recorded before this were often credited to \"Supergrass and Rob Coombes\".

Supergrass were formed in 1993 by Gaz Coombes, Mick Quinn and Danny Goffey and they released their debut single from the album, \"Caught by the Fuzz\", in May 1995 on the small independent local label Backbeat Records and was re-released with Parlophone. The title of the album is cockney rhyming slang for \"I should think so\".", "Supergrass formed in 1993 after the break-up of The Jennifers and consists of Gaz Coombes (lead vocals), Danny Goffey (drums), Mick Quinn (bass), and Rob Coombes (keyboards). Gaz Coombes, Goffey, and Quinn had been playing gigs around Oxford when they were spotted by producer Sam Williams, who said he wanted to work with them. Between the months of May and August, the band recorded a six track demo at Sawmills Studio and, having signed a deal with Backbeat Records, a limited number of copies of \"Caught by the Fuzz\" and \"Mansize Rooster\" were released. The demo had also quickly reached EMI, however, and that led to the group being signed by the Parlophone label, which would re-release the two songs. Quinn said \"it took about three and a half months total recording time and cost less to make than the video for Alright.\"", "A recording made at Carfax Tower in Oxford provided the bell chimes heard at the end of \"Strange Ones\". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass Is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, \"Sitting Up Straight\", which was not included in Supergrass Is 10. \"Strange Ones\" was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the \"throwaway song\" on the B-side to \"Caught by the Fuzz\". Another song on the album with the same theme, \"I'd Like To Know\", was inspired by listening to \"Strange Ones\" played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, \"One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.\u00a0... I remember everybody got in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [Williams] on bass, a friend of his on Hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take.\u00a0... We made I Should Coco so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!\"Supergrass Is 10 album booklet In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered \"writing that song ['Time'] in my living room on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and just did it on 4 track\".", "The group's primary musical influences came from bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes to produce a sound uniquely their own; \"we were just the three of us in my bedroom or someone's house, just making\u00a0... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think\u00a0... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that.\" Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, \"We used to listen to it a lot when we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big.\"", "\"Caught by the Fuzz\" was based on a real-life event: Gaz Coombes's arrest and caution for possession of cannabis aged fifteen. In a 2004 interview, Coombes said \"It wasn't trying to be a real statement, but at the time we knew that it was a big deal. Kids all around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It's all true so it was easy to write. It was a funny experience \u2013 not too funny at the time 'cause I was only 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It's comparable to your heart racing. The adrenaline rush you get when your mum walks into the police station is similar to the energy of the song.\"", "\"Mansize Rooster\" is said to be about a young boy with a large penis, although this is not obvious from the lyrics. Gaz Coombes once stated in an interview that \"the most embarrassing moment in pop is on our album where it goes: 'Oi Mum! Got any mandies?'\" This was one of the many exclamations made between tracks on I Should Coco in the sped-up voices of the band members. It was said before the song \"We're Not Supposed To\" began.", "Culturally, the album's glorification of teenage freedom made a very big impact on the overall Britpop music scene. The whole genre was seen as the voice of youth, but Supergrass, still teens themselves when the album was made, addressed the subject with more insight than most. The most well-known song from the album, \"Alright\", is still played regularly in Britain and Ireland, and held up as a musical example of teenage rebellion. Though it is one of their most popular songs, the band rarely play \"Alright\" in their live sets any more. In a 1999 interview, Gaz Coombes joked, \"We don't play 'Alright' anymore. We should play it in a minor key, and in the past tense.\"1999 interview with Johnathan Cohen from nudeasthenews.com Around the time of its release Coombes said that \"it wasn't written as an anthem. It isn't supposed to be a rally cry for our generation. The stuff about We are young/We run green\u00a0... isn't about being 19 but really 13 or 14 and just discovering girls and drinking. It's meant to be light-hearted and a bit of a laugh, not at all a rebellious call to arms.\" Danny Goffey noted, \"It certainly wasn't written in a very summery vibe.

Newer designs have begun to emerge in the last few years, usually building upon the designs of the '60s originals, such as the Batwing, a Marquee with a Bison-style headstock.
