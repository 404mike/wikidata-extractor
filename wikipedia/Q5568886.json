Glenn also played for other clubs, such as Linfield, Ballymena United and Lisburn Distillery.\nLater in his career, he started managing Lisburn Distillery's reserve team. He scored around 350 goals in total in his footballing career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ballymena United F.C.", "response": ["Ballymena United made a blistering start in their first season in the Premier League in 1997\u201398 and looked to be genuine title challengers by Christmas time as they topped the table after a stunning 4\u20133 victory over reigning Champions Crusaders \u2013 which also meant one of the biggest crowds in years at Warden Street for the Boxing Day derby against Coleraine; with an estimated 7,000 strong crowd packing into the Showgrounds. I typical fashion it all went off the rails for Alan Fraser's side as he splashed out a club record fee of \u00a320,000 for Crusaders striker Glenn Hunter but the goals never came and the in-form Barry Patton also saw his goals dry up as Ballymena finished sixth in the table \u2013 missing out on a top half finish on goal difference. The season almost ended in a trophy as they reached the final of the Irish News Cup, a cross-border cup competition for clubs in the North-West \u2013 but lost out to Omagh Town over two legs.", "Fraser's replacement and the man set to lead Ballymena United into the new century was former Glenavon and Bangor manager, Nigel Best who was appointed in May 1999. However, with his predecessor's aging side starting to break up and with little money to finance quality replacements; it was little surprise when Best's team struggled badly during the 1999\u201300 campaign. Striker and talisman Glenn Hunter proved his worth by almost single-handedly keeping the Sky Blues in the division, as United avoided relegation on the final day of the season after defeating Portadown at Shamrock Park to maintain top-flight status amidst wild scenes of jubilation.", "More departures followed the following summer and despite an encouraging start to the 2000\u201301 season, United's frailties caught up with them and Nigel Best was sacked after an unacceptable run of results in December 2000, cumulating with a 5\u20132 defeat to Newry Town. Bizarrely the club appointed unqualified club physiotherapist George Magill was caretaker-manager until a suitable successor to Best could be found; Glenn Hunter, who had taken time out of the game to pursue a fire-fighting career would act as Magill's assistant. In January 2001, former Coleraine manager Kenny Shiels took the reins of the Showgrounds side with the sole aim of keeping the Braidmen in the Premier League. Despite a late flurry in the final weeks of the campaign Ballymena just were not good enough and suffered relegation to the First Division after failing to defeat Portadown at home, when a win would have at least guaranteed another shot at survival in the play-offs.", "|  Glenn Hunter", "|  Glenn Hunter"]}, {"page": "Crusaders F.C.", "response": ["Hutton was quick to recognise the leadership qualities in Walker and saw him as his potential successor. Walker took over as player-manager in September 1989, two years after his arrival as a player. One of his first tasks was to apply for re-election as the Crues finished 13th out of 14 clubs. Notable players to begin their association with the club during this era were the likes of Sid Burrows, Glenn Hunter and Kirk Hunter.", "In turn, this meant more expeditions into Europe as the Crues took on teams from Switzerland, Denmark, Lithuania and Georgia within a five-year span. The team of the 1990s is regarded as one of the best in the history of the club, with a large part of the success revolving around the core of Kevin McKeown, Glenn Dunlop, Martin Murray, Sid Burrows, and the attacking duo of Glenn Hunter (who would go on to set a club goalscoring record of 157 goals) and Stephen Baxter."]}, {"page": "Roy Walker (footballer)", "response": ["He later became player-manager of Crusaders, in 1989.

Walker had a very good number of players who would become Crusaders legends. Kirk Hunter was a fan favourite along with future manager of Crusaders Stephen Baxter.
