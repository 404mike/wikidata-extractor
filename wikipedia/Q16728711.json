He produced his first feature film, The Green Sea in 2018\u20132019 and released it in 2021.  Plunkett became an advocate for rewilding in 2014 and has dedicated 750 acres of the ancestral estate in County Meath as Ireland's largest private nature reserve.  During the project, the corncrake, red kite, several species of birds of prey, and other birds, and multiple other animals, including pine marten, stoat and otter, have returned to the lands, while woodpeckers have been sighted too, for the first time.  A number of species of rescued wildlife are also being rehomed.  Lord Dunsany has made multiple appearances in the Irish press, and on radio and television, promoting the rewilding cause. As of 2021, he is engaged to marry, and his properties and title have living heirs.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of barons in the peerages of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["#*Randal Plunkett, 21st Baron of Dunsany"]}, {"page": "Baron of Dunsany", "response": [", the title is held by the eighteenth Baron's great-grandson, Randal Plunkett, 21st Baron of Dunsany, who in 2011, succeeded his father, the painter Edward Plunkett, 20th Baron of Dunsany, and first Roman Catholic holder of the title since the 12th Baron.", "*Randal Plunkett, 21st Baron of Dunsany (born 1983)"]}, {"page": "Edward Plunkett, 20th Baron of Dunsany", "response": ["In 1982, Plunkett married Maria Alice Villela de Carvalho (1942 - 2020), a descendant of the explorer Vasco Da Gama and of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral, the founder of Brazil.
