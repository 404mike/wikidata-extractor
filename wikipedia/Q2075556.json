He was also a poet and art teacher, and his posthumously published reminiscences give a chatty and often vivid picture of life in the circle of the Pre-Raphaelites; he was especially close to Dante Gabriel Rossetti. After growing up in Edinburgh, he moved to London, and from 1843 to 1864 was principal of the government School of Art in Newcastle upon Tyne, where he added industrial subjects to his repertoire of landscapes and history painting.  He was one of the first British artists to extensively depict the processes of the Industrial Revolution. He returned to London, working for the Science and Art Department until 1885.He painted a cycle of historical subjects mixed with scenes from modern industry for Wallington Hall in Northumberland (now National Trust), his best known works, and a purely historical cycle for Penkill Castle in Ayrshire in Scotland. \n\nHe did not paint many portraits, but his striking portrait of his friend Algernon Charles Swinburne is the iconic image of the poet.  His etchings were mostly designed to illustrate his books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*William Bell Scott (1811\u20131890, S)"]}, {"page": "Grace Darling", "response": ["Darling's achievement was celebrated in her lifetime; she received a large financial reward in addition to the plaudits of the nation.

This was her first work as a professional artist. The mortuary was a small windowless room, formerly a coalhouse, where bodies could be left \"reverently and lovingly\" prior to burial. The work was completed in 1886 and before the building was further developed in 1894, the murals were transferred to a new site and Traquair restored and added them, albeit in a simpler composition, between 1896 and 1898."]}, {"page": "Scottish art", "response": ["David Scott's (1806\u20131849) most ambitious historical work was the triptych Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and J. P. Nichol's Architecture of the Heavens (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother William Bell Scott (1811\u20131890), who became a close friend of founding member D. G. Rossetti. The London-based Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of Mannerist painting after Raphael. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, Iron and Coal was one of the most popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.D.

Superstition, you see, turns them into caitiffs!\" This knocked over poor Burchett so much, the transaction came to nothing\"Scott, 274-275  Scott comments that Burchett: \"gave himself up to historical painting on a rather large scale, just the kind of art which English taste and the R.
