These were distributed more widely after his winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005; his subsequent publications and related news accounts cite his status as a Nobel Laureate.  Later he continued to sign petitions on behalf of artistic and political causes that he supported.  He signed the mission statement of Jews for Justice for Palestinians in 2005 and its full-page advertisement, \"What Is Israel Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain\", published in The Times on 6 July 2006. He also co-signed an open letter about events in the Middle East dated 19 July 2006, distributed to the press on 21 July 2006, and posted on the website of Noam Chomsky.See \"Letter from Pinter, Saramago, Chomsky and Berger\"; Chomsky, \"Israel, Lebanon, and Palestine\"; and \"Palestinian Nation Under Threat\". On 5 February 2007 The Independent reported that, along with historian Eric Hobsbawm, human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman, fashion designer Nicole Farhi, film director Mike Leigh, and actors Stephen Fry and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker, among others, Harold Pinter launched the organization Independent Jewish Voices in the United Kingdom \"to represent British Jews ... in response to a perceived pro-Israeli bias in existing Jewish bodies in the UK\", and, according to Hobsbawm, \"as a counter-balance to the uncritical support for Israeli policies by established bodies such as the Board of Deputies of British Jews\" (Hodgson; IJV Declaration).  In March 2007 American television interviewer and journalist Charlie Rose conducted \"A Conversation with Harold Pinter\" on Charlie Rose, filmed at the Old Vic, in London, and broadcast on television in the United States on PBS.  They discussed highlights of his career and the politics of his life and work. They debated his ongoing opposition to the Iraq War, with Rose challenging some of Pinter's views about the United States. They also discussed some of his other public protests and positions in public controversies, such as that involving the New York Theatre Workshop's cancellation of their production of My Name Is Rachel Corrie, which Pinter viewed as an act of cowardice amounting to self-censorship.  In mid-June 2008, opposing \"a police ban on the George Bush Not Welcome Here\" demonstration organized by the Stop the War Coalition (StWC), \"Pinter commented, 'The ban on the Stop The War Coalition march in protest at the visit of President Bush to this country [England] is a totalitarian act.  In what is supposed to be a free country the Coalition has every right to express its views peacefully and openly.  This ban is outrageous and makes the term \"democracy\" laughable'.\"Qtd. in \"Protesters Will Defy Ban.\""]}, {"page": "Emily DiDonato", "response": ["She has appeared in advertising campaigns for Miu Miu, Oscar de la Renta, Giorgio Armani, Calvin Klein, Trussardi, Ralph Lauren, Just Cavalli, Missoni, Elie Tahari, Longchamp, Nicole Farhi, Aldo, Gap, Juicy Couture, and Guess."]}, {"page": "Patricia van der Vliet", "response": ["She appeared in campaigns for Balenciaga, Burberry, Sonia Rykiel, H&M and Nicole Farhi and lookbooks for Alexander McQueen and Bergdorf Goodman.
