He then dropped out of the first team picture, and spent time on loan at Leeds United, Barnsley, and Portsmouth. He was sold to Watford for a \u00a3250,000 fee in July 2011 and was a first team regular in the 2011\u201312 campaign. However, he fell out of favour the following season and was loaned out to Portsmouth and Coventry City before being allowed to join Port Vale on a free transfer in July 2013. He spent three years with Port Vale, and also served as club captain, before he moved on to Notts County for a two-year spell in June 2016. He joined Yeovil Town in June 2018 and made 104 league and cup appearances over a three year spell.

The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place \u2013 far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation.
