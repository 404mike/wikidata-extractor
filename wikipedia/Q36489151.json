However Vale suffered their worst start to a season in 50 years at the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, going a club record six games without scoring a goal as they sat bottom of the table in September following six consecutive league defeats. He was sacked on 16 September following a 1\u20131 home draw with second-from-bottom Forest Green Rovers. Speaking after his sacking, Brown said that it had been difficult for him to recruit quality players on \"a very tight budget... I think it was arguably \u00a31m under from when they had got promoted from that league the time previously\".

After returning to Port Vale, he collided with goalkeeper Sam Hornby during a reserve team match with former club Morecambe in November and came out with a fractured nose, cheekbones and eye sockets as well as a broken upper jaw and wrist; manager Neil Aspin said \"I have never seen, on a football pitch, someone get the extent of the injuries he has got\".

Yates announced his retirement as a player in March 2018, though stayed on at the club to work at the Port Vale Foundation Trust. At the end of the 2017\u201318 season he was named as Community Player of the Year and Clubman of the Year. After a public vote held in December 2019, he was named by The Sentinel as Port Vale's best right-back of the 2010s with 62% of the vote, ahead of James Gibbons (27%) and Ben Purkiss (11%).

He returned to action for two more games before he was forced to leave a 1\u20130 defeat at Coventry City early in the second half after damaging his ankle; he was subsequently ruled out of action for two months.

Manager Neil Aspin put him back into the starting eleven on 27 January in a 2\u20132 draw with Colchester United at Vale Park, and though Lainton put in a poor display he kept his place for the following home game with Morecambe, and rewarded Aspin's faith in him with an excellent performance a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw.

Despite this, he did not get to feature in the first-team despite injuries to Rob Lainton, Sam Hornby and emergency loan signing Kelle Roos, with new manager Neil Aspin choosing to draft in another emergency loan goalkeeper at the last minute, Dimitar Evtimov, rather than allowing Boot to reach five appearances and thereby preventing the club from making any further emergency goalkeeping loan signings. Evtimov proved to be a disappointment in his one appearance however, and Boot went on to play the following game and keep a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 victory over Oxford United on 3 November. Boot retained his first-team place following Lainton's return from injury, whilst Hornby was allowed to leave on loan. On 16 December, he impressed with what Aspin called a \"a first-class display\" in a 2\u20131 win at Carlisle United. On 24 March, he kept a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw at Wycombe Wanderers and his performance earned him a place on the EFL Team of the Week. However, on 2 April he dropped a routine catch to gift Crewe Alexandra the opening goal of a 2\u20132 draw before he was forced off with a foot injury; he apologised to supporters on Twitter after the game.
