Neither the team nor Cope could confirm the exact contents of the package.

In late October, parliament announced it would open an investigation into the relationship between the medical package and former rider, Bradley Wiggins. In December 2016, UCI President Brian Cookson urged both Team Sky and general manager, Dave Brailsford to give \"full disclosure\" about what was in the package.

An investigation into the jiffy bag, conducted by UK Anti-Doping, revealed that the bag had been moved by Cope in an airplane to Geneva, Switzerland where it was driven to La Toissure, France. The contents of the package is disputed. Later in June, Freeman arranged a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) for Bradley Wiggins to take triamcinolone. Freeman denies any wrongdoing surrounding the powerful drug, stating that he was \"abiding by the TUE system\". Freeman has said that his laptop, where medical records of the cyclists were kept, was stolen from a Greek hotel in 2014.  Thus, the contents of the jiffy bag is not certain. Freeman claims that it contained Fluimucil, but the medication is common throughout Europe; this questions the need to have the package sent by air."]}, {"page": "1999 British National Track Championships", "response": ["|Simon CopePaul Wingrave"]}]}}
