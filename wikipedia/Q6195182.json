Local gigs in and around Glasgow were frequent and in May 2004 the band released a self-financed limited edition double A-side single, \"I'm Gonna Get Stabbed\"/\"Ina Lvs Rab\" on CD. The single gained an early and positive review for Glasvegas from Rick Fulton of the Daily Record on 24 December 2004.  The single (along with some early demos) gained (their first) radio airplay and favourable feedback from Jim Gellatly on his radio show 'Beatbreakers' in January 2005, which was broadcast on the now defunct Beat106FM.  Although many make the obvious observation that the band name is a mix of Glasgow (where they are from) and Las Vegas (the world capital of entertainment), the band have made it clear many times that this was never the reason why the band called themselves Glasvegas.  According to James Allan he liked the name Glasvegas as it rolled sweetly off the tongue.  It is a possibility that it is the combination of the Gaelic 'Glas' (grey) with the Spanish 'vegas' (meadow). Another common mistake is that the band name is split into two words \"Glas Vegas\" (especially in the USA) which is incorrect."]}, {"page": "Mistress Mabel", "response": ["\"Mistress Mabel\" is a song by The Fratellis and the first single from their second album Here We Stand.
