Rowe Harding (10 September 1901 \u2013 10 February 1991) was a Welsh international rugby union wing who played club rugby for Swansea. An intelligent player, Harding played for several teams at club and international level. In 1926 he attended Cambridge University and played for Cambridge in a varsity match. Rowe retired from rugby at the age of 28 when he was called to the bar, and would later become a Circuit Court judge in 1953. Harding spent his later life connected with all manner of sports. He was Welsh Rugby Union vice-president from 1953 to 1956, chairman and president of Glamorgan County Cricket Club, president of Swansea Lawn Tennis and Squash Rackets Club and patron of Cwmgors RFC.\nHarding was a published author of the rugby book, Rugby Reminiscences and Opinions which is noted for its forthright and blunt viewpoints on the issues affecting Welsh rugby at the time, for example, while addressing the Welsh Rugby Union in 1950 \"The Rugby League is only an infant, but it wants strangling.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mountain Ash RFC", "response": ["During the late 1959/60 season, Mountain Ash had an excellent season losing only four matches under the captaincy of Denis Bryant, who became the club President in the 1970s, and was also instrumental in the creation of the senior second team in the 1960/61 season. In 1963 the first clubhouse was opened by former Welsh international Judge Rowe Harding, which was followed by silverware in the 1964/65 season when they won the Mid District Championship."]}, {"page": "Swansea RFC", "response": ["*  Rowe Harding 1924", "* Rowe Harding 1924\u201328"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France", "response": ["Wales: Tom Johnson (Cardiff), Ernie Finch (Llanelli), Albert Jenkins (Llanelli), Albert Stock (Newport), Rowe Harding (Swansea), Jack Wetter (Newport) capt., Eddie Williams (Neath), Bobby Delahay (Cardiff), Dai Parker (Swansea), Jack Gore, (Blaina), Charlie Pugh (Maesteg), Steve Morris (Cross Keys), Cliff Williams (Llanelli), Douglas Marsden-Jones (London Welsh), Dai Hiddlestone (Neath) "]}, {"page": "1991 in Wales", "response": ["*10 February - Rowe Harding, rugby player, 89"]}, {"page": "Rugby union in Romania", "response": ["For the first half of the 20th century, Romanian rugby was fairly isolated, having most of its contact with France, and to an extent, the Iron Curtain in the second half did not help either. However, this \"isolation\" was broken when Rowe Harding took the Welsh team Swansea touring there, to play national champions, Locomotiva. On his return to the UK, Harding spoke highly of the Romanian game, speaking of its consistently high standard and of the passion of both the fans and the players, which he thought unparallelled in Europe outside the Five Nations. The tour and Harding's praise effectively opened up Romanian rugby to the rest of western Europe, sparking a number of tours travelling to and from the country. In 1955, a Romanian side toured England and Wales, playing Swansea, Cardiff, Bristol and the Harlequins, winning one, drawing two, and losing one. Later in 1955, the Romanians defeated Llanelli in Moscow, and then beat both Cardiff and Harlequins in Bucharest. Only France, who played Romania before almost 95,000 fans in Bucharest (in a preliminary match to a soccer international), could beat the Romanians, and that was only after an epic 16-15 battle."]}, {"page": "1901 in Wales", "response": ["*10 September \u2013 Rowe Harding, Wales and British Lions rugby player (died 1991)"]}, {"page": "Gowerton Comprehensive School", "response": ["* Rowe Harding: rugby union player.

The next season Andrews was back, but in the first game against England, Wales lost 11-9, though Andrews scored his second international try during the game. His next match was as part of Ossie Male's team that beat France, and Andrews scored his final international try.

Lewis was one of 8 new Welsh caps on the day, and the relative inexperienced team, under the captaincy of Rowe Harding, drew 3-3 with the England team. Lewis was dropped for the rest of the tournament, but was back in 1927, again against England, but this time at Twickenham. Wales lost the match 11-9, though the team played with only 14 men for most of the match, when Newports Dai Jones was injured in the first quarter of an hour.

In 1927 Bowdler was selected to face the touring Australian Waratahs and the next year  made his debut in the Five Nations Championship in a game against England, which was also the last game for Wales captain Rowe Harding. Bowdler played out the entirety of the 1928 Five Nations Championship and the 1929 season. An unsuccessful period in Welsh rugby, Bowdler played through into the early 1930s when the team's fortunes began changing. He missed the 1931 Five Nations Championship, when Wales actually won the tournament, but was selected to play against the 1931 touring South Africans. His final game was at Ravenhill against Ireland in 1933, when Wales lost the selectors dropped 11 players from the squad. Bowdler was one of them."]}, {"page": "Bernard Turnbull", "response": ["Turnbull's next game was against England in the 1928 Five Nations Championship, in a game Wales should have won but for a slip by the normally reliable Rowe Harding. Turnbull was now on four match losing streak for Wales but his next game was against France, who had failed to beat Wales in the first 13 Championship encounters. Like the 1927 match against England, France were a 14-man team for the majority of the game after an early injury; and therefore when Wales lost the game the result was an even bigger embarrassment.  Turnbull was not selected for the 1929 Welsh season, but was back in 1930 for his final game against Scotland at Murrayfield. Wales lost 12-9 and Turnbull ended his international career without experiencing a Welsh victory."]}, {"page": "Albert Stock", "response": ["Born in Newport, Stock was introduced to rugby while serving in Egypt during World War I.

Under the captaincy of Rowe Harding, Stock was part of a ramshackle selection, caused by the late suspension of Ossie Male. Wales won, but unconvincingly."]}, {"page": "Charlie Pugh", "response": ["Pugh was first selected to represent Wales in the opening match of the 1924 Five Nations Championship. Played at home at St Helen's, Wales faced England, who had finished the previous season as home nations Grand Slam winners. Under the captaincy of Joe Rees, Pugh was one of nine new Welsh caps in the team who would eventually lose 17-9 to England. Pugh was reselected for the next game of the tournament, away to Scotland, but this was an even worse result than the English game, with the Welsh team letting in eight tries. Six of the Wales team never played for the national team after this match, though the selectors kept faith in Pugh for the next match against Ireland. After Jack Whitfield's lone spell as captain in the Scotland game, the Welsh were now led by Rowe Harding, though the result remained the same. In a close game at the Cardiff Arms Park, Pugh scored his only international points when he scored one of two Welsh tries, though this was not enough to gain victory over the Irish team. In the final game of the tournament, Pugh found himself again selected, the only forward to have played in all four matches of the Championship.Smith (1980), pg 204."]}, {"page": "Tommy Rees (rugby)", "response": ["In 1926, Rees was playing for Welsh exile team London Welsh, and after an excellent victory against Cross Keys at Blackheath on 6 March, Rees along with teammates Windsor Lewis and Wick Powell, was selected to face Ireland as part of the 1926 Five Nations Championship.Jones (1985), pg 81. The game was played at St. Helen's, Swansea, with the Welsh team being led by Swansea's Rowe Harding. The Wales team were victorious over Ireland, robbing the Irish of both the Triple Crown and Grand Slam. Rees scored his first international points during the game with a single conversion, and at the end of the match, the three London Welsh players were carried from the pitch shoulder-high. The press recorded that Rees had \"a great game that caused intense enthusiasm\". Rees was reselected for the next Wales international, the final game of the 1926 tournament, away to France.
