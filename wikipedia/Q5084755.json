On 25 October 2014, Pugh played as Bournemouth beat Birmingham City 8\u20130 away to set a club record win, in which he scored the first hat-trick of his career in the second half. Pugh and full-back Charlie Daniels formed a partnership on the left-hand side of the pitch during 2014\u201315, the duo starting all matches but one of a 14-match unbeaten run for Bournemouth. He scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Bolton Wanderers on 27 April 2015 with a left-footed shot into the top corner; this result all but sealed Bournemouth's promotion into the Premier League. He played in a 3\u20130 away win against Charlton on 2 May 2015, which confirmed promotion and, thanks to Watford drawing their last match, the Championship title. This was the first time Bournemouth had been promoted into the top flight in the club's 125-year history.
