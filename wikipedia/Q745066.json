He scored his third goal for City in a 1\u20131 draw with Luton Town.

He was an intimidating figure for the opposition and he could be intimidating as a team-mate as well. I'd stand behind him in the tunnel and he'd be beating his chest, ready for battle.

Morrison was presented with the playoff trophy at the end of the game and became the fifth City captain (following Sam Cowan, Roy Paul, Tony Book and Mike Doyle) to lift a trophy at Wembley.

Upon signing, Pouton became a first team regular and went on to play in the majority of Grimsby's games that season. Surprisingly, in hindsight, Pouton only picked up two bookings that season in 41 games. His first goal for Grimsby (and only goal of the season) was an equaliser at Blundell Park, Pouton volleyed in at the far post after Nicky Weaver parried Lee Ashcroft's cross in a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester City. Over the next three seasons, Pouton was booked 18 times and sent off twice. Despite his occasional lapses in discipline, Pouton was generally a success at Grimsby, and although he was not noted for his goals, he still managed eleven goals including a hat-trick in the 6\u20132 home win against Wimbledon (although two of those goals were penalties). He became a cult hero for his Never Say Die attitude, and his repeat step-overs, although he suffered increasing disciplinary problems, missing many games through a combination of injury and suspension. In the 2002-03 season, Grimsby were relegated to Division Two after finishing bottom of Division One.
