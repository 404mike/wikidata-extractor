He failed to make a first team appearance between September and 9 March, only returning to the side following a run of three consecutive defeats. He broke his leg during 1935\u201336 pre-season training, but made a speedy recovery to feature in a 2\u20130 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield on 18 September. He found himself a first team regular under new manager Bob McGrory, who utilised him as a left-sided half-back in the place of ageing veteran Harry Sellars.

In the game against Scotland, Brook was part of an England forward line which included Sammy Crooks, Bobby Barclay, George Camsell and Cliff Bastin. The result was a 1\u20131 draw, which meant that Scotland won the championship that season. In the same year, Brook scored in the 6\u20132 demolition of Hungary. Brook replaced Stoke City's Joe Johnson in the team when he withdrew from the squad due to an injury. One Scottish journalist stated that the 'Hungarians played the prettiest football' and that the score-line was a 'crying injustice'. Another journalist stated that England's wingers, Sammy Crooks and Brook, contributed powerfully to the victory, that Brook constantly did the right thing and that his goal was a gem. A different journalist stated that 'on the extreme left Brook was the opportunist that he always is, and, like Drake, ever a potential matchwinner'. A journalist for the Nottingham Journal stated that Brook and Carter were the best forwards in the second half and that 'they had some splendid passing bouts'. Ted Drake scored a hat-trick in the game and Cliff Britton and Raich Carter scored England's other goals. Drake's second goal was scored from a corner taken by Brook."]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["The directors, who had used cash resources carefully, allowed Mather to build up his squad, and he duly pulled off three excellent deals, the returning Harry Davies from Huddersfield Town, goalkeeper Roy John and winger Joe Johnson.

But Stoke City manager Bob McGrory caught wind of the potential transfer and arrived earlier and persuaded Baker to sign for Stoke instead. He spent the 1936\u201337 season in Stoke's reserves, making only the occasional first team appearance due to England international Joe Johnson occupying left-wing position. But he managed to get his chance one match into the 1937\u201338 season as Johnson injured his ankle and Baker took full advantage. He linked up well with his centre forward Freddie Steele providing him with many crosses and he also chipped in with 12 goals and scored a further 10 in 1938\u201339. He was called up for army duty in 1939 and therefore played few matches for Stoke in the War League, although he did guest for Sunderland and Northern Irish club Linfield.

Sadly though as in the past injuries again interrupted the managers team and formation plans as both Freddie Steele and Charlie Scrimshaw suffered long term injuries. In November 1937 Stoke accepted a \u00a36,000 offer from West Bromwich Albion for Joe Johnson and in his place Bob McGrory selected Frank Baker.
