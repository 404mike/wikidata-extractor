He specialised in the 400 metres, and in his teens was coached by Jock Anderson, in the same training group as Christian Malcolm. He then moved to live in Slough to be coached by Tony Lester; Marlon Devonish amongst others was one of his training partners.\nAs a youngster, he ran over 200 metres, and won several junior titles, including the World Youth Championship in 1999. Soon after, he began to concentrate on the 400 m, and was selected for the relay squad at the World Championships in Athletics in Edmonton in 2001.\nBy 2002 he had established himself as one of Britain's best athletes, winning the British AAA title, and running in the successful Team GB squad at the European Cup. In the Commonwealth Games that year, he helped guide Wales to a silver medal in the controversial 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay, which was won by England, and disputed by many, including the athletes themselves. It was during that year also that he earned a silver in the European Athletics U23 Championships in Poland.\nFollowing a number of injuries, he announced his retirement from athletics in 2009.", "link_mentions": []}}
