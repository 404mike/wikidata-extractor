He helped to design the Lloyd George Museum at Llanystumdwy which for a time housed the Caseg Press's printing press. Although new equipment allowed the Press to produce a wider range of material than previously the Press ceased production in 1951 and Petts took a series of posts with the Welsh Committee of the Arts Council. Petts was elected to the Society of Wood Engravers in 1953 and became an Associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers & Engravers in 1957. Taking a post as a lecturer in design and crafts at the Carmarthen School of Art in 1957 allowed him to concentrate on working in stained-glass."]}, {"page": "Petts", "response": ["* Kusha Petts (1921\u20132003), British artist"]}, {"page": "List of women artists associated with Wales", "response": ["* Kusha Petts (1921\u20132003)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Reading alumni", "response": ["* Kusha Petts \u2013 artist and writer"]}]}}
