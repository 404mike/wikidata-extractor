He received but little education, and for a time followed the trade of a cooper; but, possessing great natural abilities, he invented an ingenious camera obscura, and later took up engraving, in which art, although entirely self-taught, he attained to a high degree of excellence. In 1783 he went to Hull, where he resided for a few years, engraving at first shop-bills and tradesmen's cards. His earliest work of a higher class was a portrait of Harry Rowe, the famous puppet-show man, and in 1786 he etched and published a pair of views of the new dock at Hull, which were overlooked by Francis Jukes. Having executed a good plate of a woman's head after Gerard Dou, he obtained from the Marquis of Carmarthen an introduction to John Boydell, for whose large edition of Shakespeare he engraved in the dot manner twenty-two plates after Northcote, Westall, Opie, Peters, and others. Of these the finest is the entry of Cardinal Wolsey into Leicester Abbey, after Westall. Thew also engraved a few excellent portraits, including Master Hare, after Reynolds, 1790; Sir Thomas Gresham, after Sir Anthony More, 1792; and Miss Turner, with the title \u2018Reflections on Werter,\u2019 after Richard Crosse.  He held the appointment of historical engraver to the Prince of Wales, and died at or near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and was buried at All Saints church, Willian, Hertfordshire on 10 July 1802.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Patrington", "response": ["*Robert Thew (1758\u20131802), engraver"]}, {"page": "Boydell Shakespeare Gallery", "response": ["* Tempest, Act IV, scene 1 by Robert Thew after Joseph Wright of Derby", "* Merry Wives of Windsor, Act II, scene 1 by Robert Thew after William Peters", "* Taming of the Shrew, Introduction, scene 2 by Robert Thew after Robert Smirke", "* Winter's Tale, Act V, scene 3 by Robert Thew after William Hamilton", "* Macbeth, Act IV, scene 1 by Robert Thew after Joshua Reynolds", "* As You Like It, The Seven Ages, Third Age, Act II, scene 7 by Robert Thew after Robert Smirke", "* King John, Act IV, scene 1 by Robert Thew after James Northcote", "* King Richard II, Act V, scene 2 by Robert Thew after James Northcote", "* Henry IV, part 1, Act II, scene 4 by Robert Thew after Robert Smirke", "* Henry IV, part 2, Act IV, scene 4 by Robert Thew after Josiah Boydell \u2013 Prince Henry Taking the Crown", "* Henry IV, part 2, Act IV, scene 4 by Robert Thew after Josiah Boydell \u2013 Prince Henry's Apology", "* Henry V, Act II, scene 2 by Robert Thew after Henry Fuseli", "* Henry VI, part 1, Act II, scene 3 by Robert Thew after John Opie", "* Henry VI, part 1, Act II, scene 5 by Robert Thew after James Northcote", "* Henry VI, part 2, Act I, scene 4 by Charles Gauthier Playter and Robert Thew after John Opie", "* Richard III, Act III, scene 1 by Robert Thew after James Northcote", "* Henry VIII, Act III, scene 1 by Robert Thew after Matthew Peters", "* Henry VIII, Act IV, scene 2 by Robert Thew after Richard Westall", "* Timon of Athens, Act IV, scene 3 by Robert Thew after John Opie", "* Cymbeline, Act III, scene 4 by Robert Thew after John Hoppner", "* Hamlet, Act I, scene 4 by Robert Thew after Henry Fuseli", "* Act II, scene 7 by Robert Thew (no. 99), Peltro William Tomkins (no. 97), Jean Pierre Simon (no. 101, 103), John Ogborne (no. 98, 100), and William Satchwell Leney (no. 102) after Robert Smirke"]}, {"page": "Albin R.
