They were sent to France in April 1940 to join the rest of the BEF. The division suffered very heavy casualties in the Battle of Dunkirk, mainly due to most of the men being poorly trained and equipped and with little in the way of supporting units, and was disbanded in July 1940 and the 36th Brigade became an independent brigade. In June 1942, the 36th Brigade was assigned to the 78th Battleaxe Infantry Division. On 20 August 1942, however, the 7th Battalion left the brigade and was reassigned elsewhere, being replaced in the brigade by the 8th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. With the division, the 6th Royal West Kents landed in North Africa during Operation Torch and were involved in the Run for Tunis. The battalion fought throughout the Tunisian Campaign, notably helping to capture Longstop Hill in April 1943, and later fought in the Allied invasion of Sicily from July to August 1943. The 6th Battalion was serving with the 78th Division throughout the war. Shortly Afterwards, the 6th Battalion, commanded by a future politician for the Conservative Party, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Bryan, landed in Italy on 24 September 1943. Like the 5th Battalion, the 6th Royal West Kents was engaged in combat throughout most of the Italian Campaign, seeing action in the Moro River Campaign, the Battle of Monte Cassino, the fighting around the Gothic Line, and the final offensive in Italy in April 1945, followed shortly after by Germany's surrender and the European war over."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Paul Bryan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir Paul Bryan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Paul Bryan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Paul Bryan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Paul Bryan"]}, {"page": "Conservative government, 1957\u20131964", "response": ["|Paul Bryan||19 February 1958 \u2013 9 February 1961||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Heath ministry", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Minister of State, Employment||Paul Bryan||23 June 1970||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Paul Elmore Oliver Bryan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Bryan (politician)"]}, {"page": "Howden (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Paul Bryan"]}, {"page": "Boothferry (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Paul Bryan"]}, {"page": "1913 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 3 August \u2013 Paul Bryan, politician (died 2004)"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Paul Bryan; MP for Howden (1955\u20131983) and Boothferry (1983\u20131987)"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (P)", "response": ["# Paul Bryan"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Treasury", "response": ["**Paul Bryan", "**Paul Bryan", "**Paul Bryan", "**Paul Bryan", "**Paul Bryan", "**Paul Bryan", "**Paul Bryan"]}, {"page": "List of English people", "response": ["* Sir Paul Bryan (1913\u20132004)"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at St John's School, Leatherhead", "response": ["* Sir Paul Bryan DSO MC (1913-2004), former Conservative MP"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2004", "response": ["*Sir Paul Bryan, 91, British politician."]}, {"page": "Patrick Ashley Cooper", "response": ["He married Kathleen Spickett of Pontypridd, Glamorgan, and they adopted the surname of Ashley Cooper.
