He rejected advice to take an older mentor as his assistant and instead retained existing coaches Richard Cooper and Micky Moore, who he said were \"as hungry as I am for coaching\". Murray's first game as manager, a day later at Field Mill, was a 1\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle. After a successful month as caretaker-manager, Murray was given the job on a permanent basis on 5 December, becoming the youngest manager in the top four divisions of English football. He made four free transfer signings in the January transfer window: defenders Junior Brown, Michael Raynes and Matty Blair, and midfielder Ricky Ravenhill. He sold Rob Taylor to Tranmere Rovers after the versatile player sought a move closer to his home. He also made use of the loan market, bringing in Billy Kee, Callum Elder, Lenny Pidgeley, Jeffrey Monakana, Adam Smith and Terry Hawkridge. Murray signed a new two-year contract in May. Mansfield ended the 2014\u201315 season in 21st-place, seven points above relegated Cheltenham Town, and Murray released seven players in the summer, saying that \"I feel the whole club needs a fresh start\".
