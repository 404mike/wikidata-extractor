In January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, though Sears did not attend as he was in prison. He was elected unopposed as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Mayo South\u2013Roscommon South constituency at the 1921 elections.\nHe supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted for it. He was re-elected unopposed for the same constituency at the 1922 general election, this time as a pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TD. He was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD for Mayo South constituency at the 1923 general election. He lost his seat at the June 1927 general election but was elected to the Seanad in 1928. He died in office in 1929 and the by-election for his seat was won by Sir Nugent Everard.", "link_mentions": {}}}
