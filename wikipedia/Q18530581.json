His early work included public houses for the Godsell Brewery work included the designing of new country houses or partially rebuilding existing houses. He also designed country house gardens and is noted for laying out Highfields Park, Nottingham together with the adjacent Nottingham University Campus.  His early work was in the Arts and Crafts style, but after the First World War his buildings were increasingly in the Neo-Georgian fashion. He undertook architectural work in many parts of the British Isles including Ireland and at Thurso in Caithness. He is probably best remembered for the Trent Building in the University of Nottingham. and for design of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. His work at Upton House, Warwickshire for Viscount Bearsted is notable, but it is his work for Jesse Boot, both the Boot's the Chemists stores, but most importantly the Trent Building and the laying out of the Nottingham University Campus, which influenced design at other English universities, for which he must take the greatest credit.", "link_mentions": []}}
