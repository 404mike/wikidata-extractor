He gives these as, in order of the EP's sequencing: celebration, nostalgia, absurdity, innocence, bliss and dislocation. Musicologist Russell Reising says that the songs variously further the Beatles' exploration of the thematic links between a psychedelic trip and travelling, and address the relationship between travel and time. Ethnomusicologist David Reck comments that despite the Beatles' association with Eastern culture at the time, through their championing of the Maharishi, just two of the EP's songs directly reflect this interest."]}, {"page": "Taxman", "response": ["MacDonald writes that \"Taxman\" suggests the rhythmic influence of contemporaneous hit singles by James Brown, Lee Dorsey and the Spencer Davis Group, while music journalist Rob Chapman views Harrison's guitar riff as similarly American R&B-derived, citing also the Stax Records band Booker T. & the M.G.'s. According to MacDonald, McCartney's solo \"goes far beyond anything in the Indian style Harrison had done on guitar, the probable inspiration being Jeff Beck's ground-breaking solo on the Yardbirds' 'Shapes of Things'\". McCartney recalled that he approached the part wanting to add something \"feedback-y and crazy\" and likened its style and attitude to early-period Jimi Hendrix.", "In his book Psychedelia and Other Colours, Rob Chapman highlights \"Taxman\" as an example of the Beatles' widespread influence on rock music's developments during the 1960s. He says that Harrison's guitar riff \"runs like an unbroken thread through the development of English psychedelia\" and is also present \"as a trace element in many a mod-pop mutation\". Writing in Rolling Stones Harrison commemorative book, in January 2002, Mikal Gilmore recognised his incorporation of dissonance in the melody to \"Taxman\" and \"I Want to Tell You\" as having been \"revolutionary in popular music\" in 1966. Gilmore considered this quality to be \"perhaps more originally creative\" than the avant-garde styling that Lennon and McCartney took from Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgar Varese and Igor Stravinsky and brought to the Beatles' work over the same period. Revolver has been recognised as having inspired new subgenres of music, anticipating punk rock in the case of \"Taxman\"."]}, {"page": "Raga rock", "response": ["Ragas are specific melodic modes used in the classical music of the Indian subcontinent. The term \"raga rock\" originated in March 1966 as a description of rock music that featured Indian sitar styling. According to musicologist Jonathan Bellman, citing Lillian Roxon's 1969 book Rock Encyclopedia: \"This catchphrase eventually came to describe any Rock song that evoked an Indian or general Oriental mood, whether by use of sitar or another instrument imitating it.\" Music journalist Rob Chapman says the phrase was a \"catch-all term\" and \"something of a misnomer\", since it was often applied to any piece of rock music that \"used non-European instrumentation or music styles to denote its exotic qualities\"."]}, {"page": "Day Tripper", "response": ["Music journalist Rob Chapman views the guitar interplay on \"Day Tripper\" as an example of the Beatles' \"baroque sonata\" approach to musical arrangements. Harrison played the bridge's rising scale using a guitar volume-pedal effect, and overdubbed a second lead guitar part over the same section. Everett, Riley and authors Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin say that Harrison played the blues solo,; ; . while MacDonald credits Lennon. After completing the song late that evening, the band recorded the basic track for \"If I Needed Someone\" in a single take.", "Pauline Oliveros's tape-delay collage piece \"Rock Symphony\", which she debuted at the San Francisco Tape Music Center in December 1965, used samples of \"Day Tripper\" and \"Norwegian Wood\", along with recent recordings by the Animals, the Bobby Fuller Four and Tammi Terrell. Rob Chapman cites the Oliveros composition as an example of mid-1960s avant-garde composers being quick to incorporate the latest pop sounds into their work, thereby expanding the scope of their medium."]}, {"page": "Only a Northern Song", "response": ["In his book Psychedelia and Other Colours, Rob Chapman says that \"Only a Northern Song\" is one of the \"most misunderstood and maligned\" Beatles tracks, and that analyses such as MacDonald's miss \"vital nuances\", including a transcendent quality beyond Harrison's sarcasm over his publishing concerns, such that the lyrics reveal as much about the \"illusory nature of existence\" as Lennon's \"Tomorrow Never Knows\". Chapman says it would have been a welcome companion to \"Within You Without You\" on Sgt. Pepper and a counterbalance to the \"forced jauntiness\" elsewhere on that album. He also recognises the song as the only psychedelic track by the Beatles to fully addresses \"the effect of listening to music on drugs\"."]}, {"page": "It's All Too Much", "response": ["AllMusic contributor Tom Maginnis writes that the lyrics \"reflect the idealist optimism of the soon-to-be-labeled 'summer of love' and the kind of chemically enhanced mind-expanding euphoria that pervaded the new 'hippie' youth culture\". Author Ian Inglis views Harrison's mention of \"the love that's shining all around here\" and \"Floating down the stream of time\" as especially reflective of the philosophy behind the Summer of Love, while theologian Dale Allison identifies the singer's \"emerging religious worldview\" in the first of those phrases. Citing Harrison's comments that his awareness of God accompanied his first LSD experiences, music journalist Rob Chapman describes \"It's All Too Much\" as the composer's \"most unrepentant acid song\", yet also an example of his music \"oscillating between the earthly and the elevated\" and \"as much an exercise in levity as levitation\".", "In Mojos The Beatles' Final Years Special Edition (2003), Peter Doggett acknowledged the comparative rarity of \"It's All Too Much\" within the Beatles canon and added: \"Yet it's one of the pinnacles of British acid-rock, its sleepwalking rhythm retaining a bizarrely contemporary feel today.\" Having included the track in his 2011 list of Harrison's \"10 Greatest Beatles Songs\", Joe Bosso of MusicRadar commented: \"At times the song seems to drift away with Harrison's dreamy verses, but just as quickly it's chopping down trees with explosive percussion and thunderous handclaps. Wild guitar breaks by both Harrison and John Lennon help to make It's All Too Much a dizzying treat.\" In his book Psychedelia and Other Colours, Rob Chapman writes that further to the devotional and exotic \"Within You Without You\", \"It's All Too Much\" blends \"physical love, ego loss and spiritual oneness as well as any song the Beatles recorded during their psychedelic phase\"."]}, {"page": "Yellow Submarine (song)", "response": ["Music journalist Rob Chapman writes that \"Yellow Submarine\" inaugurated a trend for nursery rhyme-like songs during the psychedelic era, peaking in late 1967 with UK top-ten singles for Keith West, Traffic and Simon Dupree and the Big Sound. Nicholas Schaffner recognised the track as an exception within the music-industry phenomenon of novelty songs, which were traditionally gimmicky recordings by one-hit wonders, since the Beatles were the most popular stars of the era and achieved one of the most commercially successful novelty hits of all time. By the early 2000s, according to music journalist Charles Shaar Murray, \"Yellow Submarine\" was a \"perennial children's favourite\". Rolling Stones editors describe it as \"the gateway drug that turns little children into Beatle fans\"."]}, {"page": "Surf's Up (song)", "response": ["Wilson held the first tracking session for \"Surf's Up\" at Western Studio 3, with usual engineer Chuck Britz, on November 4, 1966. It was logged with the subtitle \"1st Movement\". Musicians present were upright bassist Jimmy Bond, drummer Frank Capp, guitarist Al Casey, pianist Al De Lory, bassist Carol Kaye, and percussionist Nick Pellico. Wilson instructed Capp to play jewelry sounds from what was possibly a ring of car keys.  Between November 7 and 8, overdubs were recorded with Capp, Pellico, and a horn ensemble consisting of Arthur Brieglab, Roy Caton, David Duke, George Hyde, and Claude Sherry. The November 7 session was dedicated to experimenting with horn effects, including an exercise in which Wilson instructed his musicians to laugh and have conversations through their instruments. The tape of this experiment was later given the label \"George Fell into His French Horn\". Journalist Rob Chapman compared the piece to experiments heard on the 1965 album The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume One (1965)."]}, {"page": "You Don't Love Me (Willie Cobbs song)", "response": ["  Cobbs claims that he heard a field hand singing \"Uh, uh, uh, you don't love me, yes I know\" to a haunting melody one morning and that inspired him to write a song.

Their proliferation in the early 1990s informed the public that the album was closer to completion than Wilson had admitted in interviews. By 1999, fans had published many essays devoted to the album through the Internet, and by the early 2000s, several books had been devoted to the album. Writing in 2002, journalist Rob Chapman summarized that the album had become \"the ultimate metaphor for pop's golden age; that moment when everything seemed possible, when heaven seemed reachable\". In Courrier's words, the project \"became oddly influential. While functioning mostly as a rumor, when some bootlegged tracks confirmed its existence, Smile became a catalyst for records that followed in its wake.\" In 2011, Smile topped Uncuts list of the greatest bootleg recordings of all time."]}, {"page": "Rob Chapman (musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rob Chapman (journalist)"]}, {"page": "Last Night in Soho (song)", "response": ["\"Last Night in Soho\" is described in Colin Larkin's Encyclopedia of Popular Music as \"a leather-boy motorbike saga portraying lost innocence in London's most notorious square mile\". Songwriters Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley wrote the song with \"a strong visual image\" in mind, prompted by a comment made by Dave Dee. The duo were keen to write a song about a British city to counter the many famous songs about cities like New York and Paris. In contrast to the exotic themes of the band's previous singles \"Zabadak!\" and \"The Legend of Xanadu\", the song is set in Soho, an area in the West End of London renowned for much of the 20th century as a base for the city's sex industry and night life. It concerns an ex-convict who attempts to go straight for the sake of his lover, but succumbs to temptation after reuniting with his hoodlum friends. The final verse finds him heading for a prison sentence and bidding a regretful farewell to his lover. Writer Rob Chapman has described the song as \"a psycho-drama set in Gangland\" with \"a middle eight straight out of Lionel Bart and Joan Littlewood\"."]}]}}
