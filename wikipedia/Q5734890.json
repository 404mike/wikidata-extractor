In 1930, he published Studio portrait lighting, a technical guidebook. He is also responsible for salvaging much of the 19th-century photography of Henry Fox Talbot, by re-photographing the remains of Talbot's photographs.In addition to photography, Lambert was also an amateur maker of musical instruments, specialising in harpsichords and clavichords.\nIn 1927, he lent a clavichord which he had built to Herbert Howells; Howells used it to compose a 12-piece collection, which he named \"Lambert's Clavichord\".Howells also introduced Lambert to Gerald Finzi, whose 1936 Interlude for oboe & string quartet, Op. 21 was inspired by Lambert.A Quaker, Lambert was imprisoned as a conscientious objector during the First World War. He lived in Combe Down, Bath, Somerset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herbert Howells", "response": ["In the same year he joined the staff of the Royal College of Music, where he was to remain until 1979. Among his pupils were Robert Simpson, Gordon Jacob, James Bernard, Paul Spicer, Madeleine Dring, and Imogen Holst. The post at the RCM, which from 1925 he combined with the position of Director of Music at St Paul's Girls' School, and frequent work as a competition adjudicator, was to reduce the amount of time he could devote to composition; but he continued to write orchestral and chamber music, including the string quartet In Gloucestershire (originally written 1916, but rewritten in whole or in part several times and not reaching its final form until the 1930s), the overture Merry Eye (1920) and the second Piano Concerto (1925). The first performance of the last named work occasioned a demonstration in the concert hall from a hostile critic. Howells, always over-sensitive to criticism, withdrew the work and produced few significant compositions for several years. Howells' friend and fellow composer, Martin Sumpter, encouraged this temporary hiatus from composing large scale works. One exception was Lambert's Clavichord (1928), a rare example of a composition by a 20th-century composer for that instrument. It was inspired by a clavichord lent to Howells by his friend Herbert Lambert, an instrument maker and photographer based in Bath. Several other major compositions written around this time, however, remained unperformed, notably an a capella Requiem to English words written in 1932,Until the publication of Palmer's researches, the Requiem was believed to have been composed in 1936. and a choral work, A Kent Yeoman's Wooing Song, written the following year.", "There are several portraits of Howells. A 1974 oil painting by Leonard Boden hangs in the collection of the Royal College of Music, and in the National Portrait Gallery, London there is a chalk sketch by Boden, an oil portrait by Howard James Morgan and photographic portraits by Herbert Lambert, Clive Barda and Elliott & Fry."]}, {"page": "Combe Down", "response": ["Herbert Lambert FRPS (1881\u20131936), society portrait photographer and harpsichord and clavichord maker."]}, {"page": "Elliott & Fry", "response": ["The firm's first address was 55 & 56 Baker Street in London, premises they occupied until 1919. The studio employed a number of photographers, including Francis Henry Hart and Alfred James Philpott in the Edwardian era, Herbert Lambert and Walter Benington in the 1920s and 1930s and subsequently William Flowers. During World War II the studio was bombed and most of the early negatives were lost, the National Portrait Gallery holding all the surviving negatives. With the firm's centenary in 1963 it was taken over by Bassano & Vandyk."]}, {"page": "William Keith Neal", "response": ["Keith Neal spent his early career working for the distinguished Bath portrait photographer Herbert Lambert. During these years his collection grew steadily, limited only by his financial resources. His work as a photographer's apprentice also \"gave him access to the great gun collections of the region's stately homes\" and \"often he came away with gifts of firearms from aristocrats moved by his enthusiasm for their gun cabinets.\" In 1930 he began reassembling the Packington Old Hall gun cabinet originally collected by Lord Guernsey. This unique collection of obsolete long arms, which had been preserved in deer grease, dated from 1725 to 1795, and become the nucleus of his \"unrivalled\" group of English sporting guns, and indeed his whole collection. He acquired the first piece \u2013 a flintlock sporting rifle, made by John Fox Twigg (1732\u20131792) \u2013 for \u00a31.15s from gun dealer Frank Russell. By 1933, his collection was already being recognised as \"one of the most complete collections of English weapons\" in private hands."]}]}}
