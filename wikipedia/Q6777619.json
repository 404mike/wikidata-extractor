The work received both praise and criticism over its usage of oral testimony from Kenyans. Three years later in 2009, a group of Kenyans who had been interned in concentration camps during the rebellion by the colonial authorities filed a lawsuit against the British government. The case, known as Mutua and Five Others versus the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, was heard at the High Court of Justice in London with the Honourable Justice McCombe presiding. Oral testimony detailing abuses by colonial officials, recorded by Elkins in Imperial Reckoning, was cited as evidence by the prosecution during the case, British lawyer Martyn Day and the Kenya Human Rights Commission. During the trial, over the course of discovery the FCO discovered some 300 boxes of previously undisclosed files that validated Elkins' claims in Imperial Reckoning and provided new evidence supporting the claimants' case. McCombe eventually ruled in the Kenyan claimants' favor, stressing the \"substantial documentation supporting accusations of systematic abuses\"."]}, {"page": "Leigh Day & Co", "response": ["#REDIRECT Martyn Day (lawyer)"]}, {"page": "Leigh Day", "response": ["#REDIRECT Martyn Day (lawyer)"]}, {"page": "Peterhouse Boys' School", "response": ["* Martyn Day (1973) - British lawyer, founder of Leigh Day."]}, {"page": "Martyn Day", "response": ["Martyn Day may refer to:", "* Martyn Day (lawyer), British lawyer", "* Martyn Day (politician) (born 1971), Scottish politician"]}, {"page": "Martin Day (lawyer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Martyn Day (lawyer)"]}]}}
