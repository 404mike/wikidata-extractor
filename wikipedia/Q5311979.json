He was leader of the Labour group from 1990 to 1996. In the 1992 general election he contested Witney for Labour, losing by a substantial margin to Conservative former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. As Labour were swept to power in the 1997 general election landslide, Plaskitt was elected MP for the previously Conservative constituency of Warwick and Leamington, beating the incumbent Dudley Smith into second place. He served on the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee from 1999, and in the 2001 general election was re-elected with an increased margin, although turnout was lower. He is a strong supporter of reforming the law on assisted dying, tackling child poverty and expanding further education. He spoke out against Israel's actions in Gaza and called for urgent reform of international banking regulation. Plaskitt tended to vote with the government on major issues such as university tuition fees and foundation hospitals. He made clear that he would only ever support increases in university tuition fees which were matched by increases in Government grants for less well-off students, and he played a leading role in supporting Warwick Hospital's application for Trust status. He is notable among Labour MPs in that he did not vote for the 2003 invasion of Iraq."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Dudley Smith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Dudley Smith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Dudley Smith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Dudley Smith"]}, {"page": "Gulf Air Flight 771", "response": ["The investigation was carried out by the American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and they released a 400-page report on their findings, which was not immediately published in the Persian Gulf region.

The seat had not been expected to change hands in the 1997 general election: as such James Plaskitt's defeat of Dudley Smith was a Portillo moment, without the decapitation of a government frontbencher. Plaskitt increased his majority in the 2001 election, but on a lower turnout. In the 2005 election, Warwick and Leamington was 85th on the Conservative list of target seats, meaning that to gain it they would have required a somewhat greater swing than was seen nationally.
