Initially a slide guitarist, Jones went on to play a wide variety of instruments on Rolling Stones recordings and in concerts, from lead and rhythm guitar and sitar to various keyboard and wind instruments.\nAfter he founded the Rolling Stones as a British blues outfit in 1962, and gave the band its name, Jones's fellow band members Keith Richards and Mick Jagger began to take over the band's musical direction, especially after they became a successful songwriting team. Jones and fellow guitarist Richards also developed a unique style of guitar play that Richards refers to as the \"ancient art of weaving\" in which both players would play rhythm and lead parts together. Richards continued the style with later guitarists, and the sound became a Rolling Stones trademark. Jones, however, did not get along with the band's manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, who pushed the band into a musical direction at odds with Jones's blues background, and with whom he got into many fights. \nWhen Jones developed alcohol and drug problems, his performance in the studio became increasingly unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he had founded. In June 1969, the Rolling Stones dismissed Jones; guitarist Mick Taylor took his place in the group. Less than a month later, at 27 years of age, Jones died by drowning in the swimming pool at his home. Jones\u2019s death was referenced in songs by many other pop bands, and Pete Townshend and Jim Morrison wrote poems about it. Referring to Jones, the Rolling Stones' Bill Wyman lamented the waste of a great innovator.

In an attempt to cash in on the British Invasion craze that was dominating the American charts at the time, the band's name was changed for the single release to the suitably British-sounding the Beefeaters.  \"Please Let Me Love You\" was issued by Elektra Records on October 7, 1964, but it failed to chart."]}, {"page": "List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees", "response": ["| Mick Jagger, Brian Jones, Keith Richards, Ian Stewart, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Ronnie Wood, and Bill Wyman."]}, {"page": "Jeff Beck", "response": ["In his autobiography, Nick Mason recalls that during 1967 Pink Floyd had wanted to recruit Beck to be its guitarist after the departure of Syd Barrett but \"None of us had the nerve to ask him.\" In 1969, following the death of Brian Jones, Beck was approached about joining the Rolling Stones."]}, {"page": "Magic Alex", "response": ["The 23-year-old Yannis Alexis Mardas first arrived in England on a student visa in 1965, befriending John Dunbar of the Indica Gallery in London, and later moving in with him in a flat on Bentinck Street, which was where Mardas first met Lennon.

Reflecting the Beatles' taste for experimentation and the avant garde, the orchestra players were asked to wear formal dress and then given a costume piece as a contrast with this attire.

He studied at the Dartford Technical School and Sidcup Art College. After graduating, Richards befriended Jagger, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts and Brian Jones, and joined the Rolling Stones. As a member of the Rolling Stones, Richards is the only member, aside from Jagger, to sing lead on some Stones songs. Richards typically sings lead on at least one song a concert, including \"Happy\", \"Before They Make Me Run\", and \"Connection\".  Outside of his career with the Rolling Stones, Richards has also played with his own side-project, The X-Pensive Winos.  He also appeared in three Pirates of the Caribbean films as Captain Teague, father of Jack Sparrow, whose look and characterization was inspired by Richards himself.  ", "Richards met Jagger again by chance on a train platform when Jagger was heading for classes at the London School of Economics. The mail-order rhythm & blues albums from Chess Records by Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters that Jagger was carrying revealed a mutual interest\"I'm looking at this guy and I..., I know you, what you've got under your arm is worth robbing\"  and led to a renewal of their friendship. Along with mutual friend Dick Taylor, Jagger was singing in an amateur band, Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys, which Richards soon joined. The Blue Boys folded when Brian Jones, after sharing thoughts on their joint interest in the blues music, invited Mick and Keith to the Bricklayers Arms pub, where they then met Ian Stewart.It's Only Rock 'n' Roll, The Ultimate Guide to the Rolling Stones, James Karnbach and Carol Bernson, Facts on File Inc., New York, NY., 1997Ian Stewart Interview by Lisa Robinson, Creem Magazine, June 1976", "Richards plays both lead and rhythm guitar parts, often in the same song; the Stones are generally known for their guitar interplay of rhythm and lead (\"weaving\") between him and the other guitarist in the band \u2013 Brian Jones (1962\u20131969), Mick Taylor (1969\u20131975), or Ronnie Wood (1975\u2013present). In the recording studio Richards sometimes plays all of the guitar parts, notably on the songs \"Paint It Black\", \"Ruby Tuesday\", \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and \"Gimme Shelter\". He is also a vocalist, singing backing vocals on many Rolling Stones songs as well as occasional lead vocals, such as on the Rolling Stones' 1972 single \"Happy\", as well as with his side project, the X-Pensive Winos.", "Since the departure of Brian Jones, Richards and Mick Jagger have shared primary songwriting and production duties (credited as the Glimmer Twins) for the Stones. Former keyboardist Ian Stewart once said that Richards was the Rolling Stones' bandleader; however, Richards has said that his job is merely \"oiling the machinery\". Unlike many bands where the drummer sets the pace and acts as a timesetter for a song, Richards fills that role for the Rolling Stones. Both former bassist Bill Wyman and current guitarist Ronnie Wood have said that the Stones do not follow the band's long-time drummer, Charlie Watts, but rather follow Richards, as there was \"no way of 'not' following\" him.", "Chris Spedding calls Richards's guitar playing \"direct, incisive and unpretentious\". Richards says he focuses on chords and rhythms, avoiding flamboyant and competitive virtuosity and trying not to be the \"fastest gun in the west\". Richards prefers teaming with at least one other guitarist and has almost never toured without one. Chuck Berry has been an inspiration for Richards, and, with Jagger, he introduced Berry's songs to the Rolling Stones' early repertoire. In the late 1960s Brian Jones's declining contributions led Richards to record all guitar parts on many tracks, including slide guitar. Jones's replacement, Mick Taylor, played guitar with the Rolling Stones from 1969 to 1974. Taylor's virtuosity on lead guitar led to a pronounced separation between lead and rhythm guitar roles, most notably onstage. In 1975 Taylor was replaced by Wood, whose arrival marked a return to a guitar interplay Richards called \"the ancient art of weaving\", which he and Jones had gleaned from Chicago blues.", "Richards was romantically involved with Italian-born actress Anita Pallenberg (d. 13 June 2017), from 1967 to 1979, after which they remained cordial.

Richards was away on tour at the time, something he said has haunted him since. He was criticised at the time for performing that night after learning of the death, but he later said it was the only way he could cope. Before they became romantically linked, Pallenberg had been involved with his fellow Rolling Stones bandmate and close friend Brian Jones. The two became a couple on a trip to Morocco that Jones had to abandon when he fell ill; the subsequent relationship between Richards and Pallenberg weighed heavily on Jones, and strained his relationship with the rest of the Rolling Stones.", "|During the mid-1960s Richards and Brian Jones were often seen with matching Firebird VIIs in vintage sunburst."]}, {"page": "1965 in music", "response": ["*March 18 \u2013 The Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger, Brian Jones and Bill Wyman are fined five pounds for urinating on the wall of a London petrol station.
