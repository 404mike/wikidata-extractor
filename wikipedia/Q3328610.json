The 2019 Vuelta was won by Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d, who became the first Slovenian cyclist to win a Grand Tour. He went on to defend his title the next year winning again, in a hard fought race with Richard Carapaz that was one of the closest finishes in recent history; and in 2021 he dominated the field with one of the largest margins of victory in more than two decades to make it three Vuelta's in a row."]}, {"page": "Bury, Greater Manchester", "response": ["* Simon Yates, professional cyclist."]}, {"page": "List of twins", "response": ["* Adam and Simon Yates (1992\u2013)"]}, {"page": "Climbing specialist", "response": ["*  Simon Yates"]}, {"page": "British Cycling", "response": ["In 2003, the first six riders joined British Cycling's new Olympic Academy for junior riders, under the leadership of Rod Ellingworth, with a budget of \u00a3100,000 for the first year.
