In the 1984\u201385 season, having scored 17 goals and 26 goals in the previous two seasons respectively, Adcock was on course to break the club's seasonal and overall scoring records, having scored 24 league goals in just 27 games up until January 1985. However, after scoring a hat-trick against Chesterfield, he suffered a knee injury in training that kept him out for the remainder of the season. This was particularly unfortunate for Adcock as it had been rumoured that Liverpool were on the verge of making an offer for him. On his return from injury, he remained with the club for two further seasons, scoring 15 and 11 goals as he played his last game for the club on 17 May 1987, a play-off second leg against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, a game which the U's drew 0\u20130 but lost 2\u20130 on aggregate following a first-leg home defeat.
