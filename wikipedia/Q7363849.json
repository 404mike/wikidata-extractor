Ipswich manager Bobby Robson made sure that he was met at Euston station in London, played in a youth match at Fulham, and was accompanied all the way to Ipswich's Portman Road ground by the club's chief scout, Ron Gray.Finch, pp. 28\u201330. Robson told Gray, \"If you miss him, you've lost your job\". The poverty Beattie came from was evident when he arrived in Ipswich wearing his father's shoes, so when Ipswich signed him, the club immediately bought him some clothes. As a youth he had played as a striker, but Robson converted him into a defender, usually a centre-half; the player said in later life that the move suited him well, as it meant he could see all the play in front of him.", "Dropping into non-League football, Beattie signed for Barry Fry's Barnet, joining another ex-England international, Steve Whitworth.Finch, p. 130. Injury and, according to Beattie, \"a combination of the drink and depression\" curtailed his spell at the club.Finch, p. 131. After failing to secure any coaching work, Beattie took up work as a labourer, and joined local team Harwich & Parkeston to supplement his income.Finch, p. 136. Accepting an offer from Ipswich's former scout Ron Gray, Beattie joined Swedish second-tier side Sandvikens IF under manager and former Swedish international player, Thomas Nordahl.Finch, pp. 136\u2013137. Soon afterward, Nordahl suddenly resigned and the club let Beattie go. He moved to Norway, signing for fourth division club Kongsberg IF, where he scored more than 60 goals in his first season.Finch, pp. 137\u2013138. He signed for Norwegian second division club Nybergsund IL-Trysil in 1988, making five appearances for them before moving back to England.Finch, pp. 139\u2013140. He also played for Clacton Town. He assisted Mike Walker and Duncan Forbes at Norwich City as a scout during Walker's time as manager and performed a similar role for Alan Ball Jr. at Portsmouth.Finch, p. 148. Beattie's first foray into coaching was a part-time position at his hometown club Carlisle United under Roddy Collins in the 2002\u201303 season.Finch, pp. 151\u2013152. Collins was sacked early in the 2003\u201304 season, and Beattie left the club, subsequently opting to coach school children in the United States.Finch, p. 153. His last coaching position was a short spell with Barry Fry at Peterborough United."]}]}}
