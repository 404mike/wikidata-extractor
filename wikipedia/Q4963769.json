His research focused upon how the environment, particularly the annual change in day-length (photoperiod), controls breeding in birds and mammals. Knighted in 1992, he won the Frink Medal (1993) and has been a Fellow of the Royal Society since 1984, and served as the Chair of the UK government's teacher training agency and Arts and Humanities Research Council, and was Vice-Chancellor of  University of Warwick.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Zoological Society of London", "response": ["*2003 Professor Sir Brian Follett"]}, {"page": "2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak", "response": ["* The Royal Society Inquiry into Infectious Diseases in Livestock.
