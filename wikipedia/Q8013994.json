This was considered by some to be in breach of section 44(v) of the Australian constitution, whereby members of parliament were banned from deriving a benefit from government actions.  Following a lively parliamentary debate, a motion that Manning and Killen were in breach of section 44(v) was defeated."]}, {"page": "1922 Australian federal election", "response": ["| William Killen", "| align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"CDF3CD\" |William Killen"]}, {"page": "John Chanter", "response": ["As a result of the dispute over conscription in 1916, Chanter left the Labor Party and, together with several other former Labor members, as well as the Commonwealth Liberal Party, formed the Nationalist Party\u2014thus reuniting him with several of his former Protectionist colleagues. He retained Riverina until the 1922 election, when he was defeated by William Killen, candidate for the new Country Party.
