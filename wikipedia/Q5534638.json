During the 1930s he wrote unpublished fiction and drama. His first book was The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis de Sade (1934, revised 1953, 1964). He then published an account of a journey he made following F\u00e9ral Benga in Africa, Africa Dances (1935, new edns. 1945 : Penguin, 1949, 1962; Eland 2003), which was a considerable success and proved to be a springboard for a career as a writer and anthropologist. After Africa Dances, his career was advanced by the publishers and anthropologists now taking a keen interest in his well-regarded work. Another cultural study followed: Bali and Angkor, or, Looking at Life and Death (1936). Hot Strip Tease appeared in 1937 and Himalayan Village in 1938.\nHis admiration for George Orwell's novel Burmese Days led him to contact Orwell in 1935.  They remained good friends until Orwell's death in 1950.\nFrom 1939 he lived and worked in the United States. He wrote The Americans (1948), The People of Great Russia.\nFrom 1957 he again worked in England. Exploring English Character, based on a large survey he designed, appeared in 1955. Death, Grief, and Mourning in Contemporary Britain appeared in 1965. The Danger of Equality and other essays (1966) collected some recent papers. Sex and Marriage in England Today appeared in 1971.\nAn article by Gorer that has contemporary relevance is the 1955  Encounter 5, essay \"The Pornography of Death,\" in which he argues that sex and death exchange positions of the forbidden in Western culture. This work has been updated for the 21st century by the sociologist Jacque Lynn Foltyn, Ph.D, who argues that death is the \"new sex,\" that death and sex have been conflated in the phenomenon she calls \"corpse porn\" in influential scholarly articles published in Mortality journal: \"The Corpse in Contemporary Culture: Identifying, Transacting, and Recoding the Dead Body in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d 13(2), 99-104, 2008; \u201cDead Famous and Dead Sexy: Popular Culture, Forensics & the Rise of the Corpse.\u201d 13(2),153-173, 2008;  and \"Bodies of Evidence: Criminalizing the Celebrity Corpse.\u201d 21 (3), 246\u2013262, 2016.  Foltyn cites Gorer's death and culture work as influencing her theories about the growing public interest in the deaths of celebrities, the forensic investigations into their causes of death, and the macabre fascination with their corpses; her expertise about celebrity deaths has been featured in interviews and appearances on CNN, BBC, CBS 48 Hours, and NBC Today Show.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Orwell", "response": ["At the outbreak of the Second World War, Orwell's wife Eileen started working in the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information in central London, staying during the week with her family in Greenwich. Orwell also submitted his name to the Central Register for war work, but nothing transpired. \"They won't have me in the army, at any rate at present, because of my lungs\", Orwell told Geoffrey Gorer. He returned to Wallington, and in late 1939 he wrote material for his first collection of essays, Inside the Whale. For the next year he was occupied writing reviews for plays, films and books for The Listener, Time and Tide and New Adelphi.

At the beginning of 1940, the first edition of Connolly's Horizon appeared, and this provided a new outlet for Orwell's work as well as new literary contacts. In May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers, Chagford Street, Marylebone. It was the time of the Dunkirk evacuation and the death in France of Eileen's brother Lawrence caused her considerable grief and long-term depression. Throughout this period Orwell kept a wartime diary.", "In his tramping days, he did domestic work for a time. His extreme politeness was recalled by a member of the family he worked for; she declared that the family referred to him as \"Laurel\" after the film comedian. With his gangling figure and awkwardness, Orwell's friends often saw him as a figure of fun. Geoffrey Gorer commented \"He was awfully likely to knock things off tables, trip over things. I mean, he was a gangling, physically badly co-ordinated young man.
