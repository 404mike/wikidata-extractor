According to E. T. Craig, this decision to will his estate to the cooperative movement was taken after a visit to the pioneering Ralahine Commune.\nMarxist James Connolly described him as the \"first Irish socialist\" and a forerunner to Marx, who cited Thompson in his works as well as being an influence upon Marx's thought.", "link_mentions": {}}}
