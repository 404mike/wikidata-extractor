According to E. T. Craig, this decision to will his estate to the cooperative movement was taken after a visit to the pioneering Ralahine Commune.\nMarxist James Connolly described him as the \"first Irish socialist\" and a forerunner to Marx, who cited Thompson in his works as well as being an influence upon Marx's thought.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Ricardo", "response": ["Ricardo's writings fascinated a number of early socialists in the 1820s, who thought his value theory had radical implications.
