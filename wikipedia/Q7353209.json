He authored multiple medical textbooks and is considered the \"Father of American Physiology\" after the publication of his landmark textbook Human Physiology in 1832. He was the personal physician to Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe. He consulted in the treatment of Andrew Jackson and was in attendance at Jefferson's death.\nHe served as chair of materia medica, therapeutics, hygiene and medical jurisprudence at the University of Maryland School of Medicine from 1833 to 1836 and chair of the Institutes of Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence at Jefferson Medical College from 1836 to 1868. He assisted William Beaumont in some of his experiments on gastric digestion and published the first description of Huntington's disease in his textbook The Practice of Medicine in 1842.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Huntington's disease", "response": ["Although HD has been recognized as a disorder since at least the Middle Ages, the cause has been unknown until fairly recently. Huntington's was given different names throughout this history as understanding of the disease changed. Originally called simply 'chorea' for the jerky, dance-like movements associated with the disease, HD has also been called \"hereditary chorea\" and \"chronic progressive chorea\". The first definite mention of HD was in a letter by Charles Oscar Waters, published in the first edition of Robley Dunglison's Practice of Medicine in 1842. Waters described \"a form of chorea, vulgarly called magrums\", including accurate descriptions of the chorea, its progression, and the strong heredity of the disease. In 1846 Charles Gorman observed how higher prevalence seemed to occur in localized regions. Independently of Gorman and Waters, both students of Dunglison at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Johan Christian Lund also produced an early description in 1860. He specifically noted that in Setesdalen, a secluded mountain valley in Norway, the high prevalence of dementia was associated with a pattern of jerking movement disorders that ran in families."]}, {"page": "Complex regional pain syndrome", "response": ["The condition currently known as CRPS was originally described during the American Civil War by Silas Weir Mitchell, who is sometimes also credited with inventing the name \"causalgia\". 377 pages. However, this term was actually coined by Mitchell's friend Robley Dunglison from the Greek words for heat and for pain. Contrary to what is commonly accepted, it emerges that these causalgias were certainly major by the importance of the vasomotor and sudomotor symptoms but stemmed from minor neurological lesions. In the 1940s, the term reflex sympathetic dystrophy came into use to describe this condition, based on the theory that sympathetic hyperactivity was involved in the pathophysiology. In 1959, Noordenbos observed in causalgia patients that \"the damage of the nerve is always partial.\" Misuse of the terms, as well as doubts about the underlying pathophysiology, led to calls for better nomenclature. In 1993, a special consensus workshop held in Orlando, Florida, provided the umbrella term \"complex regional pain syndrome\", with causalgia and RSD as subtypes."]}, {"page": "Gray's Anatomy", "response": ["The first American publication was edited by Richard James Dunglison, whose father Robley Dunglison was physician to Thomas Jefferson.\"Gray's Anatomy: The Jefferson Years\" in Jeffline Forum, September 2003 Dunglison edited the next four editions.

Tucker had sprightly begun his work on this production in 1850, at the age of 75. Robley Dunglison commented as follows on the work: \"To aid him in the execution of his work, as [Tucker] himself remarks, it had been his good fortune to have a personal knowledge of many, who bore a conspicuous part in the Revolution, and of nearly all those who were the principal actors in the political dramas which succeeded. The history extends to the elevation of General William Henry Harrison to the Presidency in 1841, which is as far as Tucker thought he could prudently go.\" The work includes a brief review of slavery, in which Tucker took issue with Jefferson's decades-old view in his Notes on the State of Virginia (1781), that slavery still had a degenerative effect upon slaveholders."]}, {"page": "List of slave owners", "response": ["*Robley Dunglison (1798-1869), English-American physician, medical educator and author - purchased slaves from Thomas Jefferson while teaching at University of Virginia"]}, {"page": "University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg", "response": ["* Robley Dunglison (1798-1869), personal physician to Thomas Jefferson, considered the \"Father of American Physiology\""]}, {"page": "University of Maryland School of Medicine", "response": ["*Robley Dunglison, Chair of materia medica, therapeutics, hygiene and medical jurisprudence (1833-1836), Thomas Jefferson's personal physician"]}, {"page": "Laurel Hill Cemetery", "response": ["*Robley Dunglison, (1798\u20131869), \"Father of American Physiology\""]}, {"page": "University of Virginia School of Medicine", "response": ["At the first meeting of the university's Board of Visitors in 1819, a School of Medicine was authorized.
