In April 2009, at the inaugural Lisanelly Shared Educational Campus Steering Group meeting held in Arvalee School and Resource Centre, the Education Minister, Caitr\u00edona Ruane announced that funding had been allocated to be used to develop exemplar designs and associated technical work for a Shared Educational Campus in Omagh. Work on the development began in October 2013, with the first school, Arvalee School, and a proposed completion of 2019 has been put forward.

The last eleven-plus was held in November 2008. A provision in the Education Order (NI) 1997 states that \"the Department may issue and revise guidance as it thinks appropriate for admission of pupils to grant-aided schools\". Citing this on 21 January 2008, Northern Ireland's Education Minister Caitr\u00edona Ruane passed new guidelines regarding post-primary progression as regulation rather than as legislation. This avoided the need for the proposals to be passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, where cross-party support for the changes did not exist. Some schools, parents and political parties object to the new legal framework. As a result, many post-primary schools are setting their own entrance examinations."]}, {"page": "Education in Northern Ireland", "response": ["Northern Ireland formerly ran a transfer test at a governmental level to decide which primary school students qualified for a place at a Grammar School.

This policy was continued by subsequent minister John O'Dowd. The majority of grammar schools did, however, decide to set their own entrance exams, a situation which continues to this day.
