Poe was identified by Lovecraft as the first author of a distinct type of supernatural fiction different from traditional Gothic literature, and later commentators on the term have also suggested Poe was the first \"weird fiction\" writer. Sheridan Le Fanu is also seen as an early writer working in the sub-genre. Literary critics in the nineteenth century would sometimes use the term \"weird\" to describe supernatural fiction. For instance, the Scottish Review in an 1859 article praised Poe, E. T. A. Hoffmann and Walter Scott by saying the three writers had the \"power of weird imagination\".Machin, p. 22 The Irish magazine The Freeman's Journal, in an 1898 review of Dracula by Bram Stoker, described the novel as \"wild and weird\" and not Gothic.Machin, p. 14 Weinstock has suggested there was a period of \"Old Weird Fiction\" that lasted from the late 19th to early 20th centuries. S. T. Joshi and Mi\u00e9ville have both argued that there was a period of \"Haute Weird\" between 1880 and 1940, when authors important to Weird Fiction, such as Arthur Machen and Clark Ashton Smith were publishing their work. In the late nineteenth century, there were a number of British writers associated with the Decadent movement who wrote what was later described as weird fiction. These writers included Machen, M. P. Shiel, Count Eric Stenbock, and R. Murray Gilchrist.Machin, p. 78 Other pioneering British weird fiction writers included Algernon Blackwood, William Hope Hodgson, Lord Dunsany,Joshi 1990, p. 42 Arthur Machen,Joshi 1990, p. 12 and M. R. James.Joshi 1990, p. 133 The American pulp magazine Weird Tales published many such stories in the United States from March 1923 to September 1954. The magazine's editor Farnsworth Wright often used the term \"weird fiction\" to describe the type of material that the magazine published.Machin, p. 222-5 The writers who wrote for the magazine Weird Tales are thus closely identified with the weird fiction subgenre, especially H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Fritz Leiber and Robert Bloch. Other pulp magazines that published weird fiction included Strange Tales (edited by Harry Bates),\"Bates had an affinity for weird fiction, but Strange Tales didn't go in for Lovecraft's brooding, wordy atmospherics.\" Ed Hulse, The Blood 'n' Thunder Guide to Pulp Fiction.
