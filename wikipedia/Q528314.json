Henry had studied Cushing's mannerisms many years previously for the lead role in British TV show Young Sherlock, but insisted on a screen test as he was not comfortable that his vocal imitation was accurate, stating he sounded more \"Peter O'Toole than Peter Cushing\". The ILM team searched through hours of footage to find suitable material of Cushing to build from. The footage from A New Hope was lit very differently to the lighting used in Rogue One and had to be digitally changed. The more they manipulated the lighting to match the other actors in the scenes the less like Cushing the character model looked, which meant creating a balancing act between \"a digital figure\" and \"one who looked precisely like Cushing\". The owners of Cushing's estate were heavily involved with the creation and had input right down to \"small, subtle adjustments\".

Cushing's estate owners were heavily involved with the creation which took place more than twenty years after Cushing died.
