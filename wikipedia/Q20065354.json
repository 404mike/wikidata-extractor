This earlier church, built very much after the style and plan of St. Thomas\u2019 Church, Free School Street, was consecrated by Bishop Reginald Heber on 12 November 1829. It appears to have fallen into a state of disrepair, due chiefly to white ants having eaten into the beams, and was declared unsafe for divine worship. An attempt was made to repair the building, but while the work was in progress, the roof fell in  during the early hours of the morning of 23 August 1859, leaving the church in ruins. It was decided to abandon any further attempts to repair the Church as it was found to be very much out of the way, and in many ways inconvenient for those attending it. The church authorities, therefore, resolved to build a new church in a more convenient locality and, in conjunction with it, a school for the children of the neighbourhood. Prominent vicars of this church in the past include the late Fr Basil Manuel and the Rt Revd Dr John Perumbalath, currently Bishop of Bradwell in the Church of England."]}, {"page": "Template talk:Crockford", "response": ["*John Perumbalath "]}]}}
