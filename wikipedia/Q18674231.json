In 1790, he was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy and was later a member of the Council of that organisation and a secretary.\"Report of the Council, March 16, 1849\", Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Vol. 4 (1847\u20131850), pp. 309\u2013313. In 1799, he was passed-over for the chair in Natural and Experimental Philosophy in favour of Thomas Elrington but possibly as a form of consolation prize was appointed assistant to Francis Hodgkinson, the newly appointed professor of modern history who did not deliver any lecturers on the subject between then and his death in 1840. John Kearney, provost of the college, whose brother Michael Kearney had enjoyed great success by writing and publishing four lectures on the government of Rome, suggested to Miller that he do something similar in the field of modern history. As a result, Miller developed a lecture series on modern European history that found an audience \"more remarkable for its intelligence than its numbers\" at first but which gradually grew in popularity until it had to be delivered in the Examination Hall.\"Trinity College in 1830 (Part III)\", R.B. McDowell and D.A. Webb, Hermathena, No. 78 (November 1951), pp. 22\u201331."]}]}}
