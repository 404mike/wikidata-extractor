At the 1931 general election he was elected as MP for Gateshead, a previously safe seat for the Labour Party, but where two Labour MPs had died that year. He defeated the influential union leader Ernest Bevin, who was the Labour candidate. He held the Gateshead seat until his defeat at the 1945 general election by the left-wing Labour candidate Konni Zilliacus.", "link_mentions": {}}}
