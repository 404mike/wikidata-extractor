For the fourth time, the match was contested by select teams of amateur and professional players. It was played on 5 October 1925 at White Hart Lane, London, and ended as a 6\u20131 win for the Amateurs. Claude Ashton scored four goals and Frank Macey two for the Amateurs; Charlie Hannaford scored the Professionals' goal.", "Two minutes into the second half, the Professionals were awarded a penalty for handball. Seymour took the kick, but shot straight at Howard Baker, after which the Times reporter felt the Professionals lost heart. Shortly afterwards, Ashton received a pass from Billy Bryant, dummied Cecil Poynton and hit a low drive past Hardy for his and the Amateurs' third goal. Macey chipped the ball over Hardy for the fourth, and after a passing move involving several players, Macey pulled the ball back to give Ashton a tap-in. Edgar Kail found Macey unmarked, and he \"got the last goal with both Spencer and Charlton trying to worry him off the ball [which] was typical of his work throughout.\" With five minutes left, a move down the right wing between Walsh and Charlie Hannaford led to the latter's consolation goal for the Professionals.", "|Forward|| Charlie Hannaford||Clapton Orient"]}]}}
