Despite the high strategic value of the information she passed to the Soviets, she refused to accept any financial rewards for her work. She rejected the Soviets' offer of a pension, and argued that her disclosures of classified work helped to avoid the possibility of a third world war involving the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.In The Mitrokhin Archive: The K.G.B. in Europe and the West, co-authored by Christopher Andrew, she is described as \"both the most important British female agent in KGB history and the longest serving of all Soviet spies in Britain.\" She is also described by the Communist Party of Britain (CPB), as a \"a real heroine\" and \"a consistent fighter  in defence of peace and socialism.\" She was also widely known as a life-long supporter of the Morning Star newspaper, and its predecessor the Daily Worker.In popular culture she is most known for her depiction in the 2018 spy drama Red Joan, whose protagonist was loosely inspired by Norwood's life.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 2", "response": ["*  2005   \u2013 Melita Norwood, English civil servant and spy (b. 1912)"]}, {"page": "March 25", "response": ["*1912 \u2013 Melita Norwood, English civil servant and spy (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "Judi Dench", "response": ["Dench was cast as the elder version of titular character Joan Elizabeth Stanley in Trevor Nunn's spy drama film Red Joan (2018). Based on Jennie Rooney's same-titled novel, it was inspired by the life of KGB intelligence source Melita Norwood. While the film earned generally negative reviews, Dench was applauded for her performance, with The Daily Telegraph agreeing that \"Dench is wasted in this absurd portrayal.\" Her other film of 2018 was All Is True, a fictional historical film for which she reunited with Kenneth Branagh to portray William Shakespeare's wife Anne Hathaway. Released to favorable reviews, critics called the film \"impressively cast and beautifully filmed. All Is True takes an elegiac look at Shakespeare's final days.\" Also in 2018, Dench appeared alongside Eileen Atkins, Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith in Roger Michell's documentary film Nothing Like a Dame which documents conversations between the actresses, interspersed with scenes from their career on film and stage. It received rave reviews, with The Guardian declaring it an \"outrageously funny film\"."]}, {"page": "Bexleyheath", "response": ["* Melita Norwood (1912\u20132005), Cold War Soviet spy"]}, {"page": "Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater", "response": ["King went on to serve as Defence Secretary under Prime Minister John Major during the Gulf War.

In 1999, The Spectator garnered outrage from Peierls's family when it published an article by journalist Nicholas Farrell that alleged that Peierls was a spy for the Soviet Union. The article was based on information supplied by intelligence historian Nigel West, who identified Peierls as the spy codenamed \"Fogel\" and later \"Pers\" in the Venona intercepts, and his wife Genia as the spy codenamed \"Tina\". However, the association of Tina with Genia did not fit with what was known about Tina, and she was conclusively revealed to be Melita Norwood in 1999. Nor did Peierls fit Pers, as the latter worked at the Clinton Engineer Works, whereas Peierls did not."]}]}}
