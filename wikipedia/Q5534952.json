Adjacent to Halnaker was a quarry, then being dug out by the Amey Roadstone Corporation (ARC), whose foreman, Godfrey Udeil, subsequently informed the archaeologists that his men had found a ditch and pot sherds dating from the Romano-British period in their gravel pits. The Institute of Archaeology decided to open up excavations of this ditch in 1982 and 1983, with Roberts being employed as supervisor for the first of these two seasons by site director Owen Bedwin. The excavations actually led to the discovery of a Romano-British farmstead, although the site also revealed evidence of older occupation; many of the excavators spent their free time hunting for the Palaeolithic stone tools \u2013 or \"palaeos\" \u2013 which were found scattered about the Quarry.Pitts and Roberts 1998. pp. 73\u201375.

It has since been modified for and celebrated in many local ecumenical events in almost all parts of the world. For instance, many churches in North America use it on World Communion Sunday. According to Geoffrey Wainwright, \"its popular reception is at least an indication of the felt need for an instrument whereby a common faith can be confessed, celebrated, proclaimed, and taught together.\" In the words of Gordon Lathrop: \"the text became a place in which diverse churches could meet each other.\" Lathrop also credits its success to its high quality. Teresa Berger attributes the success to it being an expression of the convergences of BEM. While the success of BEM allowed for the Lima Liturgy to succeed, the converse is also true: the Lima Liturgy served to further the significance of BEM, particularly its understanding of the Eucharist. According to the WCC: \"as one prominent German ecumenist put it, more Christians have learned what they know about BEM through participating in the Lima Liturgy than through reading BEM itself.\" There have, however, also been criticisms of the Lima Liturgy, from Catholics, the Orthodox and Protestants and, according to Frieder Schulz, \"Talk of an 'ecumenical Mass' is premature\". The Orthodox, in particular, have criticized the liturgy for not being able to resolve the issue of ecclesiology and the Eucharist. One female Oriental Orthodox member of the Central Committee of the WCC, Mary Thomas, was discredited by her Church for having taken part in the celebration of the Lima Liturgy as reader and was ultimately forced to resign. Another point of criticism is that the Eucharist has no longer been celebrated in WCC Assemblies after 1991, either with the Lima Liturgy or WCC's former procedures. Crawford and Best point out the irony in the fact that \"although the Lima  liturgy has been the subject of critical study and comment by theologians and liturgists, the Faith and Order Commission itself has yet to engage in any sustained reflection on or revision of one of its most widely known products.\""]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2020", "response": ["*Geoffrey Wainwright, 80, British theologian.A Reflection on Geoffrey Wainwright (1939-2020)"]}]}}
