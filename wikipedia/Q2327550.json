He played Ferdinand in the 1989 production of John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi. In November 2016, he was in a \"Read Not Dead\" performance of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Coxcomb at the Sam Wanamaker theatre on Bankside.\nIn 1990, he appeared as a doctor in the first episode of the comedy Keeping Up Appearances (entitled \"Daddy's Accident\"), and has also featured in episodes of numerous TV series, including The Bill, Casualty, EastEnders, Midsomer Murders and Doc Martin. In 1997, Alexander had a small role in the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies.\nIn 2013, he played the character of Peter Bachman in several episodes of the TV series Love and Marriage:\n\nThe Elephant in the Room\nSecrets & Lies\nAlarm!\nHuge Weekend for the Paradise FamilyAlexander's radio credits include the role of Mike in Westway, the BBC World Service soap opera which ran from 1997 to 2005, and the role of Doc de Salis in the BBC dramatisation of the John le Carr\u00e9 novel The Honourable Schoolboy.Alexander is the president of the Haddenham Museum in Haddenham, Buckinghamshire and is also a patron of Thame Players Theatre in Thame, Oxfordshire, along with Sir Tim Rice.In 2019, Alexander appeared in the BBC soap opera Doctors as Ray Hopkins.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 28", "response": ["*1946 \u2013 Bruce Alexander, English actor"]}, {"page": "1946", "response": ["** Bruce Alexander, English actor"]}, {"page": "Tim Rice", "response": ["Rice is a patron of the London-based drama school, Associated Studios and is also a patron of Thame Players Theatre along with Bruce Alexander."]}, {"page": "A Touch of Frost", "response": ["The series stars David Jason as Detective Inspector William Edward \"Jack\" Frost, an experienced and dedicated detective who frequently clashes with his superiors. In his cases, Frost is usually assisted by a variety of different detective sergeants or constables, with each bringing a different slant to the particular case. Comic relief is provided by Frost's interactions with the bureaucratically-minded Superintendent Norman \"Horn-rimmed Harry\" Mullett, played by Bruce Alexander.", "* Bruce Alexander as Superintendent Norman Mullett", "* Superintendent Stanley Mullett (Bruce Alexander, 1992\u20132010), a social climber concerned with appearances and ambitious for promotion, is Frost's boss and his constant foil on the job. Mullett has a love-hate relationship with Frost, whose detective skills he admires but whose people and political skills he abhors. The long-suffering Mullett frequently threatens to sack Frost, but Frost's ability to close cases usually saves him. In addition, receiving the George Cross made Frost \"the Chief Constable's blue-eyed boy\", thus protecting Frost from being sacked or retired by Mullett. His background in the novels was extensive; highly educated and a qualified solicitor, Mullett always drove a prestige car and was married in the series to Elspeth, who was occasionally seen, and was assured promotion to Chief Superintendent once the new police station was completed. Eventually, this promotion is turned down in a later episode thanks to yet another crisis caused by Frost who, surprisingly, gets off lightly. Frost's nickname for Mullett is \"Horn-rimmed Harry\" due to the traditional design of his spectacles. Frost also has a plastic, mounted grey mullet hanging on his office wall; a grey mullet is a species of fish commonly found in British coastal waters but not usually eaten as it is regarded as being bland. Frost constantly tries to avoid Mullett but, just as he thinks he has managed to avoid him, Mullett spots him and generally calls out, \"Ah, Jack\" to which Frost replies, \"Ah, there you are, sir\". His first name was given in the novel \"Hard Frost\" as Stanley, but this novel was not written until a couple of years after the name Norman was given to the character by the writers of the TV series. In the final episode, Mr. Mullett appears to be wearing a blazer with the badge of the Army Intelligence Corps. However, in earlier episode, SE3E1, Mullett is shown wearing a blazer with an unidentified (but not Intelligence Corps) British army badge."]}, {"page": "The History Boys", "response": ["|Headmaster||Clive MerrisonMalcolm Sinclair (23 January 2006 to 28 January 2006, international tour until Broadway)||Bruce Alexander||William Chubb||David Mallinson"]}, {"page": "Stephen Lowe (playwright)", "response": ["Lowe has worked with many leading directors including Bill Alexander, Alan Ayckbourn, Annie Castledine, Jonathan Chadwick, Anthony Clark, Stephen Daldry, Alan Dossor, Richard Eyre, Bill Gaskill, David Leveaux,  and Danny Boyle, who early in his career was assistant director on Lowe\u2019s play Tibetan Inroads.
