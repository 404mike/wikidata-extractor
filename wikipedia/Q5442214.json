He is Dick Francis\u2019 younger son.Felix studied physics and electronics at London University, and then embarked upon a 17-year career teaching Advanced Level physics at three schools, the last seven as head of the science department at Bloxham School in Oxfordshire, before quitting to look after his father's affairs. He currently lives in Oxfordshire. From 1993 to 2005, he was a director and deputy chairman of World Challenge Expeditions Ltd. Felix is also a former governor of Winchester House Prep School, and is a governor of Malvern College.Dick's wife, Mary Francis, assisted with both the research and the writing of many of Dick's novels until her death in 2000. Felix provided her assistance in this effort, and upon his mother's passing, Felix took over her work. Felix and his father often worked together on plot and character details at Dick\u2019s home in the Cayman Islands. This partnership allowed Dick to draw upon Felix\u2019s knowledge and experience as a physics teacher in Twice Shy and his past as an international marksman in Shattered (2000) and Under Orders (2006).With the publication of Dead Heat in 2007, Felix took on a more significant role in writing. Silks (2008) was the second novel in this father-and-son collaboration, and Even Money (2009) was the third. Crossfire (2010) was the novel Dick and Felix were working on when Dick died in February 2010.\nFelix's first novel written without his father was Gamble, published in September 2011, begins the \"Dick Francis novel\" franchise.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dick Francis", "response": ["Francis rarely re-used his lead characters.
