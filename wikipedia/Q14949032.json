Nevertheless, his power and influence grew, and in 1870 he joined the company formed for the revision of the English New Testament. From that time onward he was a prolific writer. His style, prolix at first, became pure and graceful, and in such works as those on the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ and on the Revelation of St. John he took a foremost place among British theologians. In the church courts, too, his rise was steady. In 1872 he was sent, together with the Rev. J. Marshall Lang (now Principal Lang) as a representative from the general assembly of the Church of Scotland to the assembly of the Presbyterian church in the United States; in 1875 he was elected depute-clerk of the general assembly, and in 1886 he succeeded Principal John Tulloch as principal clerk."]}, {"page": "List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland", "response": ["*1878 John Tulloch (Principal, St Mary's College, St Andrews)"]}, {"page": "History of the University of St Andrews", "response": ["left|frame|St Salvator's Chapel, by Malcolm McFadyenThe modern buildings, in the Jacobean style, were erected between 1827 and 1847.
