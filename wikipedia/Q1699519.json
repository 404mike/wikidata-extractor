He then worked as a virologist at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia and at the Virus Research Institute at Entebbe, Uganda. He returned to Australia to work in the School of Microbiology at the John Curtin School of Medical Research. Cairns took a sabbatical to research at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory between 1960 and 1961, and returned there to serve as the director from 1963 to 1968. He remained a staff member at Cold Spring Harbor until 1972, when he was appointed head of the Mill Hill Laboratory of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. After leaving Mill Hill in 1980 he took up a professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health. He retired in 1991.\nIn his 1963 paper \"The bacterial chromosome and its manner of replication as seen by autoradiography\", Cairns demonstrated by autoradiography that the DNA of the bacterium Escherichia coli was a single molecule that is replicated at a moving locus (the replicating fork) at which both new DNA strands are being synthesized. Subsequently, it was found that there were in fact two moving forks, traveling simultaneously in opposite directions around the chromosome.\nIn 1974 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1981, John Cairns received a MacArthur Foundation (\"genius\") Fellowship. He is the author of the 1978 book Cancer: Science and Society (now out of print) and the 1997 book, Matters of Life and Death: Perspectives on Public Health, Molecular Biology, Cancer, and the Prospects for the Human Race. Together with James Watson and Gunther Stent, Cairns also edited the collection of historical accounts Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Macfarlane Burnet", "response": ["Under Burnet's direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the \"golden age of virology\".

Moreover, its cellular abundance of approximately 400 molecules per cell did not correlate with the fact that there are typically only two replication forks in E. coli. Additionally, it is insufficiently processive to copy an entire genome, as it falls off after incorporating only 25\u201350 nucleotides. Its role in replication was proven when, in 1969, John Cairns isolated a viable polymerase I mutant that lacked the polymerase activity.  Cairns' lab assistant, Paula De Lucia, created thousands of cell free extracts from E. coli colonies and assayed them for DNA-polymerase activity. The 3,478th clone contained the polA mutant, which was named by Cairns to credit \"Paula\" [De Lucia]. It was not until the discovery of DNA polymerase III that the main replicative DNA polymerase was finally identified."]}, {"page": "List of geneticists", "response": ["*John Cairns (1922\u20132018), UK physician-scientist, showed bacterial DNA one molecule with replicating fork"]}, {"page": "Lucien Cu\u00e9not", "response": ["John Cairns as recently as 2003 credited Lucien Cu\u00e9not with the one-gene one-enzyme hypothesis."]}, {"page": "Cairns (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John Cairns (biochemist) (1922\u20132018), British biochemist", "* John Cairns (Presbyterian) (1818\u20131892), 19th century Scottish divine and writer"]}, {"page": "Theta structure", "response": ["A theta structure is an intermediate structure formed during the replication of a circular DNA molecule. Two replication forks can proceed independently around the DNA ring and when viewed from above the structure resembles the Greek letter \"theta\" (\u03b8). Originally discovered by John Cairns, it led to the understanding that (in this case) bidirectional DNA replication could take place. Proof of the bidirectional nature came from providing replicating cells with a pulse of tritiated thymidine, quenching rapidly and then autoradiographing. Results showed that the radioactive thymidine was incorporated into both forks of the theta structure, not just one, indicating synthesis at both forks in opposite directions around the loop."]}, {"page": "MacArthur Fellows Program", "response": ["*John Cairns, molecular biologist"]}, {"page": "Adaptive mutation", "response": ["The most widely accepted theory of evolution states that organisms are modified by natural selection where changes caused by mutations improve their chance of reproductive success. Adaptive mutation states that rather than mutations and evolution being random, they are in response to specific stresses. In other words, the mutations that occur are more beneficial and specific to the given stress, instead of random and not a response to anything in particular. The term stress refers to any change in the environment, such as temperature, nutrients, population size, etc. Tests with microorganisms have found that for adaptive mutation, more of the mutations observed after a given stress were more effective at dealing with the stress than chance alone would suggest is possible. This theory of adaptive mutation was first brought to academic attention in the 1980s by John Cairns.", "Adaptive mutation was re-proposed in 1988 by John Cairns who was studying Escherichia coli that lacked the ability to metabolize lactose.  He grew these bacteria in media in which lactose was the only source of energy.  In doing so, he found that the rate at which the bacteria evolved the ability to metabolize lactose was many orders of magnitude higher than would be expected if the mutations were truly random.  This inspired him to propose that the mutations that had occurred had been directed at those genes involved in lactose utilization."]}, {"page": "Immortal DNA strand hypothesis", "response": ["The immortal DNA strand hypothesis was proposed in 1975 by John Cairns as a mechanism for adult stem cells to minimize mutations in their genomes. This hypothesis proposes that instead of segregating their DNA during mitosis in a random manner, adult stem cells divide their DNA asymmetrically, and retain a distinct template set of DNA strands (parental strands) in each division. By retaining the same set of template DNA strands, adult stem cells would pass mutations arising from errors in DNA replication on to non-stem cell daughters that soon terminally differentiate (end mitotic divisions and become a functional cell). Passing on these replication errors would allow adult stem cells to reduce their rate of accumulation of mutations that could lead to serious genetic disorders such as cancer."]}, {"page": "John Cairns", "response": ["John Cairns may refer to:", "*John Cairns (biochemist) (1922\u20132018), biochemist who first demonstrated the structure and replication of the E. coli genome", "*John Cairns (cricketer) (1925\u20132014), English cricketer", "*John Cairns (politician) (1859\u20131923), British politician, MP for Morpeth", "*John Cairns (1818\u20131892), Scottish divine and writer", "*John Cairns (1857\u20131922), United Presbyterian Church minister, writer and biographer", "*John Cairns (born 1942), former moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland", "*John Cairns (footballer) (1902\u20131965), Scottish football forward"]}, {"page": "Gunther Stent", "response": ["*John Cairns, G.

John Cairns demonstrated the theta structure of E. coli chromosomal replication in 1963, using an innovative method to visualize DNA replication. In his experiment, he radioactively labeled the chromosome by growing his cultures in a medium containing 3H-thymidine. The nucleoside base was incorporated uniformly into the bacterial chromosome. He then isolated the chromosomes by lysing the cells gently and placed them on an electron micrograph (EM) grid which he exposed to X-ray film for two months.
