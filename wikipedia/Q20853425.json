He is best known for his work on the design of monumental buildings, especially the Pantheon, Rome, and that of the Architectural orders in both Roman and Greek contexts. He is the author of two important books of classical architecture, and is currently a senior lecturer (associate professor) at the University of Bath.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Corinthian order", "response": ["The name Corinthian is derived from the ancient Greek city of Corinth, although the style had its own model in Roman practice, following precedents set by the Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus (c. 2 AD).Mark Wilson Jones, \"Designing the Roman Corinthian order\", Journal of Roman Archaeology 2:35-69 (1989). It was employed in southern Gaul at the Maison Carr\u00e9e, N\u00eemes and at the comparable Temple of Augustus and Livia at Vienne. Other prime examples noted by Mark Wilson Jones are the lower order of the Basilica Ulpia and the Arch of Trajan at Ancona (both of the reign of Trajan, 98\u2013117 AD), the Column of Phocas (re-erected in Late Antiquity but 2nd century in origin), and the Temple of Bacchus at Baalbek (c. 150 AD).Jones 1989. ", "Proportion is a defining characteristic of the Corinthian order: the \"coherent integration of dimensions and ratios in accordance with the principles of symmetria\" are noted by Mark Wilson Jones, who finds that the ratio of total column height to column-shaft height is in a 6:5 ratio, so that, secondarily, the full height of column with capital is often a multiple of 6 Roman feet while the column height itself is a multiple of 5. In its proportions, the Corinthian column is similar to the Ionic column, though it is more slender, and stands apart by its distinctive carved capital. The abacus upon the capital has concave sides to conform to the outscrolling corners of the capital, and it may have a rosette at the center of each side. Corinthian columns were erected on the top level of the Roman Colosseum, holding up the least weight, and also having the slenderest ratio of thickness to height. Their height to width ratio is about 10:1."]}, {"page": "Pantheon, Rome", "response": ["Mark Wilson Jones has attempted to explain the design adjustments by suggesting that, once the higher pediment had been constructed, the required 50 foot columns failed to arrive (possibly as a result of logistical difficulties). The builders then had to make some awkward adjustments to fit the shorter columns and pediments. Rabun Taylor has noted that, even if the taller columns were delivered, basic construction constraints may have prevented their use. Assuming that each column would first be laid on the floor next to its pediment before being pivoted upright (using something like an A-frame), there would be a space requirement of a column-length on one side of the pediment, and at least a column-length on the opposite side for the pivoting equipment and ropes. With 50 foot columns \u201cthere was no way to sequence the erection of [the columns] without creating a hopeless snarl. The shafts were simply too long to be positioned on the floor in a workable configuration, regardless of sequence.\u201d Specifically, the innermost row of columns would be blocked by the main body of the temple, and in the later stages of construction some already-erected columns would inevitably obstruct the erection of further columns."]}, {"page": "Mark Jones", "response": ["*Mark Wilson Jones (born 1956), architect and architectural historian"]}, {"page": "David Hemsoll", "response": ["His 1987 article with Paul Godfrey influentially proposed observations of the design of the Pantheon that questioned whether it had been used as a temple.
