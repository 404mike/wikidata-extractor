Best remembered for originating the lyric baritone roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas from 1877 to 1896, his performing career spanned more than four decades.  He also wrote at least a dozen works for the stage.After two years with a comic touring company, Barrington joined Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera company and, over the next two decades, created a number of memorable comic opera roles, including Captain Corcoran in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), the Sergeant of Police in The Pirates of Penzance (1880), and Pooh Bah in The Mikado (1885), among many others.  Failing in an 1888 attempt to become a theatrical manager, Barrington refocused his energies on acting and occasional playwriting.\nBeginning in 1896 and continuing for ten years, Barrington played in a series of very successful musical comedies under the management of George Edwardes at Daly's Theatre, specialising in comic portrayals of pompous rulers or other persons of authority.  One of the most popular features of his performances was his insertion of topical songs, or verses of songs, into these musical comedies.  After leaving Daly's he continued to appear in musical comedy roles and performed in music hall.  He also essayed a few Shakespeare and other dramatic roles and appeared in a few silent films.  His career ended in 1918, after which he suffered a stroke and lived the last few years of his life in poverty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gilbert and Sullivan", "response": ["The repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S.

Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in The Sorcerer transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in Pirates. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage.
