One day, Phillips went to a bookseller's with the express intention of buying a cheap book to use as the basis of an art project. He randomly purchased a novel called A Human Document by Victorian author William Hurrell Mallock, and began a long project of creating art from its pages. He paints, collages or draws over the pages, leaving some of the text peeking through in serpentine bubble shapes, creating a \"found\" text with its own story, different from the original. Characters from Mallock's novel appear in the new story, but the protagonist is a new character named \"Bill Toge\", whose surname can only appear on pages which originally contained words like \"together\" or \"altogether\". Toge's story is a meditation on unrequited love and the struggle to create and appreciate art."]}, {"page": "Russell Kirk", "response": ["* British and American authors such as Fisher Ames, John Randolph of Roanoke, Orestes Brownson, John Henry Newman, Walter Bagehot, Henry James Sumner Maine, William Edward Hartpole Lecky, Edwin Lawrence Godkin, William Hurrell Mallock, Leslie Stephen, Albert Venn Dicey, Robert Nisbet, Paul Elmer More, and Irving Babbitt."]}, {"page": "Oxford period poetry anthologies", "response": ["William Allingham \u2013 Matthew Arnold \u2013 Thomas Ashe \u2013 Henry Bellyse Baildon \u2013 William Barnes \u2013 Aubrey Beardsley \u2013 Thomas Lovell Beddoes \u2013 Hilaire Belloc \u2013 J.
