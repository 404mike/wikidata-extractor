In a fourteen-year professional career in English football he made 344 appearances in league and cup competitions.\nA former Bolton Wanderers trainee, he began his career with Crystal Palace in 1994. Failing to establish himself in the first team during his five years at the club, he joined Sheffield United via Colchester United in 1999. The following year he signed with Port Vale, where he first found regular football. In 2002, he transferred to Peterborough United via Crewe Alexandra. Four years later he moved on to Shrewsbury Town, before spending the 2007\u201308 campaign with Barnet. He retired from the game following a brief spell with Rushden & Diamonds in 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["In a bid to survive another season in the First Division, Horton allowed ten players to leave Vale Park; the most significant departure was Neil Aspin, as the 34-year-old dropped down two divisions as his career wound down. To replace these players, Horton signed three players on free transfers: Jeff Minton from former club Brighton, Tommy Widdrington from Grimsby Town, and Steve Rimmer from Manchester City. As the season progressed he released Marcus Bent, and sold Carl Griffiths back to Leyton Orient for \u00a3100,000. He further sold highly rated young centre-back Anthony Gardner to Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a31 million, and sold Tony Butler to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a3140,000. In their place he signed Micky Cummins, Mark Goodlad, Sagi Burton, and Ville Viljanen; and also took Martin Bullock, Gareth Taylor, and David Healy in on loan.

On 12 December, Rushden & Diamonds confirmed that Knight had been sacked after continual breaches of conduct between November and December 2008. Despite his contract having been terminated, Rushden & Diamonds retained the player's registration, preventing Knight from joining another English club until the term of his contract had expired, unless \u00a330,000 in compensation was paid to the club. The FA confirmed and validated the retaining of the registration, meaning Knight could not play at any level of English football until the contract had expired. The contract had initially been due to expire following the 2009\u201310 season, but Rushden & Diamonds invoked a clause allowing them to extend the contract by a further year."]}, {"page": "Stephen Jordan (footballer)", "response": ["In the summer of 2004, Peterborough United made an offer for Jordan who was out of contract at Manchester City, as he was under 24 at the time Peterborough would have been required to pay compensation to Manchester City under the Bosman ruling. Kevin Keegan, the then City boss, said that he hoped Jordan would sign a new contract and remain with the club. A fortnight later City revealed that Jordan had signed a 12-month extension to his contract and would remain at the club until 2005. Peterborough then contacted Manchester City with the hope of loaning the player as cover for their injured defender Sagi Burton, Keegan agreed to the loan but Jordan did not want to go as he felt he was close to breaking into the first team at City."]}, {"page": "List of foreign Premier League players", "response": ["*Sagi Burton \u2013 Crystal Palace \u2013 1997\u201398"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Football League Trophy", "response": ["|DF ||6 || Sagi Burton"]}, {"page": "Matt Carragher", "response": ["He moved on to Port Vale in 1997, after John Rudge judged Carragher to be a potential replacement for the ageing Dean Glover and Neil Aspin.

The tone of the game was set by Vale's dominant five-man midfield, with Brammer the engine that drove the \"Valiants\" search for an equaliser as Brentford struggled to keep pace. It was Brammer who made the Vale's intentions clear; sending a long-range strike goal ward, only for it to be deflected wide. Whereas Sagi Burton made the Brentford defence nervous from set pieces, misers Naylor, Brooker and Bridge-Wilkinson presented the danger from open play. On the 20 minute mark, Naylor pulled back a ball which Bridge-Wilkinson hooked wide.
