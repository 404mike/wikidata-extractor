His handling was sound, he got the game moving quickly and even though some of his kicks were skewed wide, he whacked the ball long and hard.\" Assistant manager Eric Black said that Doyle had \"shown that he's more than capable and he's ready to have a go now and challenge Maik Taylor\" for the starting position. He kept his place in the team for the remainder of the season as Birmingham were promoted back to the Premier League. At the club's end of season awards, Doyle picked up both the \"Breakthrough Award\" and the award for \"Magic Moment of the Season\", for his penalty save from Wolverhampton Wanderers' Michael McIndoe at Molineux that gained Birmingham a crucial three points. Doyle finished the season with eight clean sheets from 22 appearances."]}]}}
