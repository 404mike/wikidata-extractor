Working in both watercolour and oils, he exhibited widely in London in the late 19th century at venues such as the Royal Academy and the Grosvenor Gallery. From 1896 he lived at Thirlestane Court.\nHe illustrated a number of books featuring the British landscape (see below), notably Kent, Canterbury, and The Peak Country. He also drew scenes from the Welsh Elan Valley in the 1890s, before it was flooded to form the Elan Valley Reservoirs, which appeared in two books by Grant Allen (see \"illustrated Books\" below).\nHowever, it was as a superlative wood-engraver that he was mainly known in his lifetime. He \"raised the art of wood-engraving to a very high pitch of excellence\" remarked the Kent and Sussex Courier in 1916. His prints (sometimes large) were widely published in many British magazines of the day such as The Pall Mall Gazette, The Illustrated London News, The English Illustrated Magazine and The Magazine of Art. He was a firm advocate of traditional wood-engraving considering it to be the most versatile in comparison to the more conventional methods of engraving and etching, or more recent methods including \"process illustration\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*William Biscombe Gardner (1847\u20131919)"]}, {"page": "Wood engraving", "response": ["*William Biscombe Gardner"]}, {"page": "Gardner (surname)", "response": [":* William Biscombe Gardner (1847\u20131919), English painter and engraver"]}, {"page": "Arthur Comfort", "response": ["Comfort was born in London on 11 November 1864, where he attended the Graphic School of Wood Engraving, and afterwards worked as an engraver for almost 15 years at The Graphic, a national illustrated journal founded in 1869 by William Luson Thomas and his brother Lewis Samuel Thomas. During that time, he achieved some renown for his watercolours, especially of flowers, and his work was exhibited in Brussels and at the Royal Academy in London.  He was regarded as one of the few engravers of high rank at the end of the nineteenth century in Great Britain along with Charles Roberts, William Biscombe Gardner and Charles Frederick Ulrich. He became the chairman of the international Society of Wood Engravers, but, with the development of half-tone and screen blocks for illustrations, wood-engraving became obsolete, and he left the journal and moved north."]}, {"page": "William Gardner", "response": ["*William Biscombe Gardner (1847\u20131919), English painter and wood-engraver"]}, {"page": "The Magazine of Art", "response": ["The Magazine of Art was an illustrated monthly British journal devoted to the visual arts, published from May 1878 to July 1904 in London and New York City by Cassell, Petter, Galpin & Co.
