O'Brien often creates ambient sounds and textures, using effects, sustain units and the EBow. He also provides backing vocals. In 2010, Rolling Stone named O'Brien the 59th greatest guitarist of all time. Along with the other members of Radiohead, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\nO'Brien's first solo album, Earth, was released in 2020. O'Brien had been writing songs for years, but lacked confidence and felt they had a \"distinct energy\" that would be lost with Radiohead.
