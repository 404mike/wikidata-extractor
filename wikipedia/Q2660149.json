For almost a century, Goodwin's gravestone in the Fairview Cemetery read \"Erected to the memory of an unknown child whose remains were recovered after the disaster to the Titanic April 15th 1912\".\nInitial DNA testing in 2002 pointed to third class passenger Eino Viljami Panula as the probable individual; however, subsequent testing in 2007 conclusively identified the child's remains as those of fellow third class toddler Sidney Leslie Goodwin.", "link_mentions": {}}}
