He next played a full season in the 1922 season, scoring two half-centuries, including a career-best 75 against Leicestershire when with Wilfred Carter made a 182 eighth-wicket partnership, a record for the county which still stands today.  He played regularly in the 1923, 1924 and 1925 seasons. In the 1926 season he took 5 wickets for 84 against Essex and finished the season with all three of his career half-centuries to his credit.  He played regularly but without significant impact in the 1927 season, which was his last.  He was a right-handed batsman and played 96 innings in 64 first-class matches.  His top score was 75 and his average 14.80.  He was a right-arm medium-fast bowler and took 44 wickets at an average of 29.75 and a best performance of 5-84.Anthony Jackson at Cricket Archive"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1920", "response": ["Fifteen players made their debut in the season, half of them playing three or fewer matches.
