His opportunities for travel, his curiosity about local customs and human types, and his eye for the picturesque, led him to make paintings which are now historical resources. A landscape painter and a costumbrista, he was the first visual artist to leave records of the ordinary inhabitants of the newly emergent Argentina and Uruguay, including the first depictions of gauchos. He also left records of Canada, Brazil, the West Indies and St Helena, where he sketched the newly deceased Napoleon.\nNo full-length biography of Vidal yet exists; only brief accounts written from the viewpoints of the lands he visited.  Although a number of his watercolours have been published as hand-coloured aquatints, or by modern printing methods, or sold at auction, it is plausible that most have been lost or await rediscovery in private collections.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vidal", "response": ["*Emeric Essex Vidal (1791\u20131861), English watercolourist"]}, {"page": "Argentine painting", "response": ["In the first years of the 19th century, many foreign artists visited and resided in Argentina, leaving their works.
