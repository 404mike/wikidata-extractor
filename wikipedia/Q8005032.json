Originally from Walberton, near Chichester, he came to Hambledon to play after being \"spotted\".Barber finished playing in 1777.  He is said to have bowled a \"high delivery on a good length\" and was probably a medium quick bowler.His family and that of Thomas Brett were inter-married.  Barber seems to have been a shoemaker but he latterly took over the Bat and Ball Inn (see also Broadhalfpenny Down) from Richard Nyren.  He died aged 71 in 1805 and was buried in Catherington.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hambledon Club", "response": ["The subject is complicated by a reference to the Kent versus Hampshire & Sussex match at Guildford Bason on 26 and 28 August 1772.

Sussex cricket was not very prominent during the Hambledon period and this could have been because Hambledon operated a team effectively representing two counties.

Slindon's best player was the great Richard Newland, supported by his brothers Adam and John; and by the controversial Edward Aburrow, a good cricketer but a known smuggler. After the death of Richmond in 1751, Sussex cricket declined until the emergence of the Brighton club at its Prince of Wales Ground in 1790. Despite some periods of decline, Sussex continued to be a major cricket county throughout the 18th century. It has been suggested by historians that the Hambledon Club represented Sussex as well as Hampshire for inter-county purposes. Several noted Sussex cricketers, including Richard Nyren, Noah Mann and William Barber, played for Hambledon."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|William Barber", "|William Barber, CricketArchive.
