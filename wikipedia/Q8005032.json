Originally from Walberton, near Chichester, he came to Hambledon to play after being \"spotted\".Barber finished playing in 1777.  He is said to have bowled a \"high delivery on a good length\" and was probably a medium quick bowler.His family and that of Thomas Brett were inter-married.  Barber seems to have been a shoemaker but he latterly took over the Bat and Ball Inn (see also Broadhalfpenny Down) from Richard Nyren.  He died aged 71 in 1805 and was buried in Catherington.", "link_mentions": {}}}
