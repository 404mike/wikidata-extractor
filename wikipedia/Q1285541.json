These sessions were so successful that the three of them reformed Traffic to release the album John Barleycorn Must Die.

The score was given the working-title of Jam for World in Action, and has been credited variously to Jonathon Weston or to Shawn Phillips. The English musician Mick Weaver also claims to have jointly authored the score with Phillips.Statement by Mick Weaver on Youtube, September 2016 via the 'Mick Weaver' channel: 'Any comment about the 'World in Action' theme being written by Shawn Phillips, is utter bullshit. I played the B3 Organ parts over a descending chord progression that Phillips came up with. It was a 50/50 collaboration between he and I, and I am utterly pissed off with this charlatan claiming or being credited with having 'created' the entire thing. What happened was that Shawn came to me and said that he had been asked to compose some theme music for a T.V. programme, and that he had come up with a chord progression, but needed help with putting some melody lines to it, and asking would I be interested in collaborating with him to complete it. So, I came up with some vaguely 'Bachish' melody lines and we spent an evening in Trident Studios in Wardour Street, London, recording several segments of varying lengths of my melody lines with Shawn's chord progression. We were told by the Granada people, some of whom attended the recording sessions, that the music would become the property of Granada, and that we would be paid Musician's Union scale session fees for the evening's work, which at the time was \u00a39 per hour. Not only has my contribution to this music (not to imply that the stuff is a work of magnificent art) never been acknowledged, but I never even received the session fees. Not only that, I had to take the tube to Piccadilly Circus to get to the studio, and was never reimbursed, so, as well as never having been credited, financially or otherwise with my participation in the project, I am down the f-ing tube fare. I was young and easily conned in those days, but to be worked over by a fellow musician is especially galling ...' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95qLDc7zwYY The track was covered by Matt Berry in 2018 on his album Television Themes."]}, {"page": "Henry McCullough", "response": ["In 1975 McCullough joined the Frankie Miller Band with bassist Chris Stewart, keyboard player Mick Weaver and drummer Stu Perry.
