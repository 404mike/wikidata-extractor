Mysterio successfully defeated Angle in a two-falls match with assistance from rapper Riff Raff. In January 2017, Mysterio noted in an interview that he may consider opening up his own wrestling school. During the interview, he said: \"I just thought I would never have the time. Now being able to make that time \u2013 to not have the busy schedule I had with WWE \u2013 gives me plenty of time to be a family man. I'm hoping that this time I'm spending with my son will open up that idea again and create a Rey Mysterio Wrestling school\".

The wrestler then links their arms around the face-up opponent's torso and presses down, squeezing the opponent's spine against the wrestler's shoulder. A common variant of this hold has the attacking wrestler also apply a double underhook before or after lifting the opponent. This was used by Colt Cabana as the Colt .45. The double underhook variant is often seen when the hold is used to transition to another maneuver, such as a backbreaker drop or inverted powerbomb. Bruno Sammartino famously used this move on his opponents. Will Ospreay used the double underhook to spin his opponent into a neckbreaker called the Stormbreaker."]}, {"page": "New Japan Pro-Wrestling", "response": ["|Will Ospreay"]}, {"page": "Havering-atte-Bower", "response": ["* Will Ospreay, professional wrestler."]}, {"page": "Professional wrestling aerial techniques", "response": ["This move sees a wrestler jump forward while twisting 360\u00b0 and performing a backflip.
