He also castigated his lawyer, Iqbal Meer, saying \"I am satisfied that no honest solicitor in his position would have done what he did.\" His unquestioning acceptance of the money - transferred to a London bank account by the Zambian intelligence service - was \"classic blind eye dishonesty\". An appeal against the ruling was allowed by the court of appeal in 2008. Large sections of Zambian society have however questioned Peter Smith's credibility following reprimands and recusals by the British judiciary. Many have argued that the British Judge should have concentrated on cases pertaining to properties that were allegedly obtained by corrupt means in Britain and Europe rather than properties in Zambia. However, after offering Chiluba's clothes to his family in 2016, the Anti-Corruption Commission later secured a judgement in the Supreme Court of Zambia where Chiluba's estate (tedworth properties) was forfeited to the state after seizing it in 2002.", "Chiluba, however, continued to plead innocence and refused to recognise the verdict of the Judge Peter Smith who he accused of having been bribed by the Mwanawasa government. It is yet to be seen what effect the civil ruling in the UK will have on the criminal proceedings in the Zambian courts.
