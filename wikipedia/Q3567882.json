A Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1892, he was selected for England in three Test matches in 1893. Mold was one of the most effective bowlers in England during the 1890s but his career was overshadowed by controversy over his bowling action. Although he took 1,673 wickets in first-class matches, many commentators viewed his achievements as tainted.\nMold began his professional cricket career playing for Banbury and Northamptonshire in the mid-1880s, but by 1889 had qualified to play for Lancashire at county level. Immediately successful, he quickly established a good bowling partnership with Johnny Briggs and became one of the leading bowlers in the country. However, he only achieved selection for England in one series in 1893. Many critics thought he threw rather than bowled the ball, and he was among several bowlers at the time about whom there were similar suspicions. Controversy erupted in 1900 when Mold was no-balled for throwing by Jim Phillips, an umpire who had targeted several prominent bowlers with dubious bowling actions. After Mold avoided several games in which Phillips was umpire, the affair came to a head in 1901. On the opening morning of a match, Phillips repeatedly no-balled Mold. Several of Mold's teammates and most Lancashire supporters continued to believe that Mold bowled legally, but his reputation was ruined and, after three more appearances in 1901, he retired at the end of the season. After his departure from the game, throwing ceased to be a concern in English cricket for 50 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 29", "response": ["*1921 \u2013 Arthur Mold, English cricketer (b. 1863)"]}, {"page": "May 27", "response": ["*1863 \u2013 Arthur Mold, English cricketer (d. 1921)"]}, {"page": "1863", "response": ["* May 29 \u2013 Arthur Mold, English cricketer (d. 1921)"]}, {"page": "1921", "response": ["* April 29 \u2013 Arthur Mold, English cricketer (b. 1863)"]}, {"page": "1891 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Great Bowlers \u2013 William Attewell, J T Hearne, Frederick Martin, Arthur Mold, John Sharpe"]}, {"page": "1894 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Arthur Mold 207 @ 12.30 (BB 8\u201367)"]}, {"page": "C.

In 1895 MacLaren made his record-breaking innings of 424 against Somerset at Taunton; his innings remained the highest first-class score for an Englishman, was the first first-class quadruple century, and was the highest score in first-class cricket until Bill Ponsford scored 429 in February 1923.

The following March, he was appointed as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure;Wynne-Thomas, p. 74. his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals.Down (1981), pp. 63\u201364.McKinstry, p. 72. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs.Down (1981), p. 64. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played from the beginning of the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace.Down (1981), pp. 64\u201366. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold's bowling action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch.Down (1981), pp. 66\u201368.

His batting remained useful until 1894, after which his impatience tended to get the better of him and, despite rapidly improving pitches, he played few significant innings in his later years. CB Fry described his trademark shot as a \u201cwhizzing uppercut that travels over third man\u2019s head\u201d, a thoroughly modern sounding stroke. Nonetheless, Briggs's superb bowling \u2014 though aided by a number of sticky wickets \u2014 won Lancashire their first official County Championship in 1897, but he was a disappointment in Australia the following winter and suffered a severe decline in his bowling the following year."]}, {"page": "Charlie Townsend", "response": ["In May 1898, Townsend started his season poorly, although his nought for 150 against a powerful Surrey batting side on a soft Oval wicket was affected by several dropped catches.\u2018Surrey v Gloucestershire\u2019 ; The Times, 27 May 1898, p. 10 However, in early June after two weeks of rain he took nine for 48 (fifteen for 134 in the match) to defeat Middlesex on a sticky wicket at Lord's,Pardon, Sydney H.

Around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the Australian umpire Jim Phillips no-balled the Australian fast bowler Ernie Jones for throwing; the same umpire ended the career of England's star bowler Arthur Mold by declaring his bowling action illegal. Fifty years later, during South Africa's 1951 tour of England,  the umpire Frank Chester wanted to no-ball the South African quick bowler Cuan McCarthy, but was told by the Lord's authorities to desist: \"These people are our guests\".

Neither England's captain, Peter May, nor the tour manager, Freddie Brown, raised the issue publicly during the series, but did so afterwards, causing considerable concern to the leading administrators on each side, Gubby Allen and Sir Donald Bradman. The principal issue in these administrators' minds was what would happen if these bowlers were brought to England in 1961, when the Australians were due to visit.
