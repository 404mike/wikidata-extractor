He became prominent following the 2004 publication of his autobiography, Taming The Tiger, in which he claimed to have been a violent criminal before converting to Christianity. The book was well received by the Christian community, and Anthony began an international ministry as an evangelist. However, an independent investigation in 2013 concluded that large sections of the book are false.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mike Warnke", "response": ["* Tony Anthony - a British evangelist whose claims were exposed as false"]}, {"page": "Tony Anthony (disambiguation)", "response": ["Tony Anthony (born 1960) is an American wrestler.", "Tony Anthony may also refer to:", "* Tony Anthony (actor) (born 1937), American actor and director", "* Tony Anthony (evangelist) (born 1971), British evangelist"]}, {"page": "Avanti Ministries", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Anthony (evangelist)"]}]}}
