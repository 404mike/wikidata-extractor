Also, many of the personnel of the earlier schools found themselves entangled in historical events, typically not as members of the schools, but because they had intimate knowledge of the society and its history. The schools are not per se political. David George Hogarth, for example, a Director for a term of the British School, was an intelligence officer in the British Navy. The school had no use for him in that capacity. Along with Arthur Evans and Duncan Mackenzie, he worked very hard at archaeology in Phylakopi and Crete.

When the SBS moved to the Adriatic, he returned to Crete as Liaison Officer with ELAS, and battles against the German occupying forces.[2] For his war service to Greece, he was decorated by the Greek King, exceptionally, with the Knight's Cross of the Royal Order of George I, with Swords. After the war, he returned to St Andrews (where he was attached to the Officer Training Corps) and resumed his archaeological explorations in Cyprus.  He was promoted to major on 1 April 1948, and nominally transferred to the Intelligence Corps.
