He also made a number of recordings, including the first complete Bach Well-Tempered Clavier for EMI, recorded on the piano from 1933 to 1936. Other classic recordings by Fischer include Bach keyboard concertos, miscellaneous solo Bach works such as the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, various concertos and sonatas by Mozart and Beethoven, Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy (although he was not up to the transcendental technical demands of the finale) and Impromptus, and Beethoven's \"Emperor\" and Brahms' Second Concerto, both conducted by Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. Fischer's historically important recordings have been reissued on CD by EMI and specialty labels such as APR, Music & Arts, Pearl and Testament. Those of the Mozart Concertos K. 453, 466, 482, 491 and 503 (G major, D minor, E-flat major, C minor and C major) are particularly outstanding, especially the last three with the inspired, powerful conducting of John Barbirolli, Lawrance Collingwood and Josef Krips respectively, in 1935, 1937 and 1947."]}, {"page": "English National Opera", "response": ["Lawrance Collingwood joined the company as resident conductor alongside Corri.
