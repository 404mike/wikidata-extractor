In the book's foreword, Stephen Corry wrote: \"The 'development' of tribal peoples against their wishes \u2013 really to let others get their land and resources \u2013 is rooted in 19th century colonialism ('We know best') dressed up in 20th century 'political correct' euphemism. Tribal peoples are not backward: they are independent and vibrant societies which, like all of us always, are constantly adapting to a changing world. The main difference between tribal peoples and us is that we take their land and resources, and believe the dishonest, even racist, claim that it's for their own good. It's conquest, not development.

Since the mid-eighties, Survival International has published reports that the Botswana government has conducted a campaign of harassment to drive them out and give way to mining exploration. Louis Nchindo, Former Managing Director of Debswana, has said: \"The Government was justified in removing the Basarwa from the Reserve\u2026 It is sensible of Government to take such action. Otherwise who would always want to remain in the Dark Ages while others move forward?\". According to Stephen Corry, Director of Survival International, the Bushmen are not backward or primitive, and their human and cultural rights must be respected. The Botswana government has consistently refuted Survival's claims as exaggerated.

Survival International calls attention to the fact that these people, who least contribute to the problem of climate change, are already the most affected by it; and that we must seek solutions that involve indigenous people. Andrew E. Miller, human rights campaigner at Amazon Watch, said, \"Many indigenous peoples, understandably, are skeptical that the latest silver bullet is really in their interest.
