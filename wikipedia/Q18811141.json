Parkinson kept goal for the last couple of months of Darlington's season, and for most of the next. He was left out in December to give Frank Gower his Football League debut, but after a 4\u20130 loss to Southport, Parkinson returned to the team at the end of January and remained in it. Along with most of Darlington's contracted players, he was given a free transfer at the end of the season."]}]}}
