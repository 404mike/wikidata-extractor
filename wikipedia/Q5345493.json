He was approached by the Amateur Rowing Association to ask if he would make up a crew with Dickie Burnell for the 1948 Summer Olympics, which were to be held on the Henley course. Pinches insisted on having proper trials, but as these were not customary at the time, the ARA paired Burnell with Bert Bushnell, who subsequently won the pairs. In 1950, Pinches was runner-up in the Silver Goblets with Sturges and won the Gentlemen's Single Scull in the Skiff Championships again. Pinches was an ebullient and enthusiastic captain of the London Rowing Club in 1952. He became an international coach and attended world and European championships, as well as the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, when he advised the coxless fours and coxed fours. He continued to row competitively until he was 60, his last victory being in an international veterans' regatta in 1976 at Tours, France. "]}]}}
