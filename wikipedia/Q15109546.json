As originally built it had, like other stations, a surface booking hall (designed, like many in central London built at that time, by Leslie Green). The development of traffic before and after World War I meant that the need for improved station facilities was acute \u2013 in 1907 1.5\u00a0million passengers used the station, by 1922 it had grown to 18\u00a0million passengers. It was decided to construct a sub-surface booking hall and circulating area, which would also provide public pedestrian subways. Work began in February 1925 and was completed in 1928. The architect was Charles Holden and the builder was John Mowlem & Co: the whole complex cost more than half-a-million pounds. Eleven escalators were provided in two flights, leading to the two lines serving the station. Above these escalators was once a mural by artist Stephen Bone, showing the world with London at its centre. This mural was later replaced by advertising. The famous Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain (alias Eros), directly above the station, had to be moved to Victoria Embankment Gardens while the construction work was taking place."]}, {"page": "1904 in art", "response": ["* 13 November \u2013 Stephen Bone, English painter (d. 1958)."]}, {"page": "W.

The series was sponsored by the oil company Shell. The original guides were published on a county-by-county basis, under the editorial control of the poet John Betjeman and (later) the artist John Piper. There were three publishers involved in the publication of the thirteen pre-war titles: The Architectural Press, Batsford and finally, in 1939, Faber and Faber. In 1939 all the previous twelve titles were re-issued and one new one in the same format: David Verey's Gloucestershire. The next one planned was Shropshire to be co-written by Betjeman and Piper. However, the Second World War intervened. Only one non-English area was covered: The West Coast of Scotland by Stephen Bone, arguably the most political of all the Shell Guides. Post-war however every bit of Wales was covered in five different titles. It was not until 1951 that the next Shell Guide was produced. Jack Beddington's involvement in the Shell Guides and Shell advertising in general cannot be overestimated and it is because of him, that from the outset, artists were invited to produce Shell Guides; John and Paul Nash for instance and of course John Piper."]}, {"page": "HMS Conn", "response": ["A Stephen Bone painting of the bridge of HMS Conn as she escorts surrendering U-Boats at the end of the war is part of the Imperial War Museum's art collection.

She studied techniques of mosaic decoration in Ravenna and Sicily and had a number of exhibitions of her work both as a solo artist and alongside the works left by Stephen Bone. In 1982 she completed a mosaic mural for Beatson Walk underpass in Rotherhithe which depicted the Fighting Temeraire; a project which required long hours of work inside a cold tunnel during winter. Despite some lameness, blamed on long periods painting off ladders, Adshead remained an active working artist until the end of her life.", "Adshead's paintings are in many public gallery collections including The Tate, the Graves Art Gallery Sheffield, the Imperial War Museum, Manchester City Art Gallery, the London Transport Museum and The University Art Gallery Liverpool. There are also several surviving mural paintings.
