Music critic Simon Reynolds cited \"Are You That Somebody?\" as \"the most radical pop single\" of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that rather than being the song's focal point, Aaliyah \"knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line\", and consequently \"helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny's Child owe a clear debt to 'Are You That Somebody'.\" Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah \"had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years.\" Music publication Popdust called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground for her influence on the underground alternative music scene; the publication also mentioned that the forward-thinking music Aaliyah did with Timbaland and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artists are somewhat cut from the same cloth. While compiling a list of artists that take cues from Aaliyah, MTV Hive mentioned that it's easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and lo-fi R&B movements.

She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was \"very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R&B sounds that they produced\", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which \"really stood out\" at its time, was being replicated. With sales of 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide, Aaliyah earned the nicknames \"Princess of R&B\" and \"Queen of Urban Pop\", as she \"proved she was a muse in her own right\".

In July 1980, Closer was released, and peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart. NME reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote, \"Closer is as magnificent a memorial (for 'Joy Division' as much as for Ian Curtis) as any post-Presley popular musician could have.\"", "Joy Division took time to develop their style and quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as fairly generic and \"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\". Critic Simon Reynolds observed how the band's originality only \"really became apparent as the songs got slower\", and their music took on a \"sparse\" quality. According to Reynolds, \"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\" According to music critic Jon Savage, \"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\". In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\" By Closer, Curtis had adapted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands).", "During their live performances, the group did not interact with the audience; according to Paul Morley, \"During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear more than two or three words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion.\" Curtis would often perform what became known as his \"'dead fly' dance\", as if imitating a seizure; his arms would \"start flying in [a] semicircular, hypnotic curve\". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, \"We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit.

Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. Assisted by the mid 1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing. The growing student market serviced record labels with the word \"progressive\", being adopted as a marketing term to differentiate their product from \"commercial\" pop. Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between \"progressive\" pop and \"mass/chart\" pop, a separation which was \"also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class.\" Before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful British sound of the early 1970s, the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism, broaching the question of what it meant to be an artist in a mass medium. Progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on personal autonomy, and so the strategy of \"progressive\" rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers \"above\" normal pop practice.", "In house music, a desire to define precise stylistic strands and taste markets saw the interposition of prefixes like \"progressive\", \"tribal\", and \"intelligent\". According to disc jockey and producer Carl Craig, the term \"progressive\" was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italian disco. The music was dubbed \"progressive\" because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic Philadelphia sound. By 1993, progressive house and trance music had emerged in dance clubs. \"Progressive house\" was an English style of house distinguished by long tracks, big riffs, mild dub inflections, and multitiered percussion.

The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when a hundred or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave. Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (\u00a31000). The Act was officially introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents, and to protect the countryside. However, some participants in the scene claimed it was an attempt to lure youth culture away from MDMA and back to taxable alcohol.Simon Reynolds, Energy Flash: A Journey through Rave Music and Dance Culture, Pan Macmillan, (p. 149) () In November 1994, the Zippies staged an act of electronic civil disobedience to protest against the CJB (i.e., Criminal Justice Bill).", "American ravers, following their early UK & European counterparts, have been compared to the hippies of the 1960s due to their shared interest in non-violence and psychedelia.Energy Flash, Simon Reynolds, (p276 & 290), 1998, Macmillan Publishers () Rave culture incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music spun by DJs, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The key motive for remaining underground in many parts of the US had to do with curfew and the standard 2:00\u00a0am closing of clubs. It was a desire to keep the party going past legal hours that created the underground direction.

Many grunge musicians displayed a general disenchantment with the state of society, as well as a discomfort with social prejudices. Grunge lyrics contained \"... explicit political messages and ... questioning about ... society and how it might be changed ...\".Strong, Catherine. Grunge: Music and Memory. Routledge, 2016. p.5 While grunge lyrics were less overtly political than punk songs, grunge songs still indicated a concern for social issues, particularly those affecting young people.  The main themes in grunge were \"tolerance of difference\", \"support of women\", \"mistrust of authority\" and \"cynicism towards big corporations.\" Grunge song themes bear similarities to those addressed by punk rock musicians. In 1992, music critic Simon Reynolds said that \"there's a feeling of burnout in the culture at large. Kids are depressed about the future\". The topics of grunge lyrics\u2013homelessness, suicide, rape, \"broken homes, drug addiction and self-loathing\"\u2013contrasted sharply to the glam metal lyrics of Poison, which described \"life in the fast lane\",Gina Misiroglu.

The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll. Harvard University Press, 1996. p. 109 As with punk shows, grunge \"... performances were about frontmen who screamed and jumped around on stage and musicians who thrashed wildly on their instruments.\" While grunge lyrical themes focused on \"angst and rage\", the audience at shows were positive and created a \"life-affirming\" attitude. Grunge bands rejected the complex and high budget presentations of many mainstream musical genres, including the use of complex digitally controlled light arrays, pyrotechnics, and other visual effects then popular in \"hair metal\" shows. Grunge performers viewed these elements unrelated to playing the music.

The singer was a true original, delivering a blend of sensitivity and strength, defiance and tenderness, via a regionally inflected voice.

The term post-rock itself was notably employed by journalist Simon Reynolds in a review of the 1994 Bark Psychosis album Hex. It later solidified into a recognizable trend with the release of Tortoise's 1996 album Millions Now Living Will Never Die. The term has since been used to describe bands which differ widely in style, making the term controversial among listeners and artists alike.", "The concept of \"post-rock\" was developed by critic Simon Reynolds,The 30 best post-rock albums - FACT Magazine who used the term in his review of Bark Psychosis' album Hex, published in the March 1994 issue of Mojo magazine. Reynolds expanded upon the idea later in the May 1994 issue of The Wire. Writing about artists like Seefeel, Disco Inferno, Techno Animal, Robert Hampson, and Insides, Reynolds used the term to describe music \"using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than riffs and power chords\". He further expounded on the term, ", "The post-rock sound incorporates characteristics from a variety of musical genres, including krautrock, ambient, psychedelia, prog rock, space rock, math rock, tape music, minimalist classical, British IDM, jazz (both avant-garde and cool), and dub reggae, as well as post-punk, free jazz, contemporary classical, and avant-garde electronica. It also bears similarities to drone music.Cox & Warner 2004, p. 359 (in \"Post-Rock\" by Simon Reynolds): \"The Velvets melded folkadelic songcraft with a wall-of-noise aesthetic that was half Phil Spector, half La Monte Young\u2014and thereby invented dronology, a term that loosely describes 50 per cent of today's post-rock activity.\" (about the Velvet Underground and post-rock) Early post-rock groups also often exhibited strong influence from the krautrock of the 1970s, particularly borrowing elements of \"motorik\", the characteristic krautrock rhythm.", "In lieu of typical rock structures like the verse-chorus form, post-rock groups generally make greater use of soundscapes. Simon Reynolds states in his \"Post-Rock\" from Audio Culture that \"A band's journey through rock to post-rock usually involves a trajectory from narrative lyrics to stream-of-consciousness to voice-as-texture to purely instrumental music\".

In the United Kingdom synth-pop was in the ascendent and industrial and postindustrial music was the vanguard of musical experimentation. Many (though by no means all) cassette artists, in Europe and elsewhere, drew on this new avant-garde for their inspiration. Popular-music papers such as Sounds and NME in the UK were marked by a new type of journalism, which discussed music (perhaps sometimes over-earnestly) as a serious art-form. In terms of broader developments, the Cold War and the nuclear arms-race were still a reality. In both the UK and the USA the political Right assumed power in the form of the governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. In the UK this was accompanied by a widespread culture of opposition and dissent, often informed by radical Left ideology. The cassette-culture scene emerged in, was embedded in, this broader cultural landscape, enabled by new developments in electronic technology, and many of the artists shared a countercultural ethos in relation to the mainstream music of the time and towards contemporary society more broadly. The scene could not have existed before and the period of its flourishing gradually came to an end in the 1990s with the arrival of inexpensive digital technology for the production of both music and graphics and, of course, the arrival of the World Wide Web. Successor underground and DIY scenes have naturally arisen to take its place, but they are no more to be identified with the cassette culture that arose in the late '70s than the postpunk revival is to be identified with the original postpunk period."]}, {"page": "Industrial music", "response": ["Many of the initial industrial musicians preferred to cite artists or thinkers, rather than musicians, as their inspiration.
