Their opening pair, Peta Verco and Hill, were both caught by Goatman off the bowling of Avril Starling, while Kennare was the first of three Australian to be run out. Karen Read and Australia's captain, Tredrea, formed a solid partnership and steadied their team's innings. The pair scored 54 runs together before they were both dismissed in quick succession; Read was caught by Southgate off the bowling of Janet Tedstone for 32, while Tredrea was caught behind off Carole Hodges for 25. Australia were 97 for five, needing another 55 runs to win. England adopted a tight field to minimise Australia's scoring options, but Jen Jacobs lofted the ball over the fielders during her innings of 37, which The Times described as one of the highlights of the match. Cornish, who had been playing a support role until that point, then assumed control and scored seven runs from one over bowled by Enid Bakewell, but with Australia still needing seven runs, Raelee Thompson was run out. The Times praised England's \"excellent work in the field\", though it was ultimately a mis-field that gave Australia their winning run in the penultimate over. Cornish remained not out with 24 runs, and Australia won the match by three wickets with six balls remaining.", "| colspan=\"3\" | Did not bat: Carole Hodges, Janet Tedstone, Shirley Hodges , Avril Starling", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Susan Goatman b Avril Starling || 7", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Susan Goatman b Avril Starling || 12", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Avril Starling "]}, {"page": "East Anglia Women cricket team", "response": ["* Avril Starling (1982)"]}, {"page": "New Zealand women's cricket team in England and the Netherlands in 1984", "response": ["* Avril Starling"]}]}}
