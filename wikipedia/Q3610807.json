He appears in Dante's Inferno in the lowest circle of Hell, set apart for traitors: \"him who, at one blow, had chest and shadow / shattered by Arthur's hand\" (Canto XXXII).Inferno, Canto XXXII, lines 61\u201362 (Mandelbaum translation). Mordred is especially prominent in popular modern era Arthurian literature, as well as in film, television, and comics.Torregrossa, Michael A., \"Will the 'Reel' Mordred Please Stand Up? Strategies for Representing Mordred in American and British Arthurian Film\" in Cinema Arthuriana: Twenty Essays (Rev. edn.), ed. Kevin J. Harty. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2002 (pb. 2009), pp. 199\u2013210. He has been portrayed on screen by Leonard Penn (The Adventures of Sir Galahad 1949), Brian Worth (The Adventures of Sir Lancelot 1956\u20131957), David Hemmings (Camelot 1967), Robert Addie (Excalibur 1981), Nickolas Grace (Morte d'Arthur 1984), Simon Templeman (The Legend of Prince Valiant 1991\u20131994), Jason Done (Merlin 1998), Craig Sheffer\u00a0(Merlin: The Return 2000), Hans Matheson (The Mists of Avalon 2001), and Asa Butterfield and Alexander Vlahos (Merlin 2008\u20132012), among others. In such modern adaptations, Morgause is often conflated with (and into) the character of Morgan le Fay, who may be Mordred's mother or alternatively his lover or wife. A few works of the Middle Ages and today, however, portray Mordred as less a traitor and more a conflicted opportunist, or even a victim of fate.The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 394. Even Malory, who depicts Mordred as a villain, notes that the people rallied to him because, \"with Arthur was none other life but war and strife, and with Sir Mordred was great joy and bliss.\""]}, {"page": "Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans", "response": ["* Versailles (2015 TV series), played by Alexander Vlahos"]}, {"page": "Kenichi Suzumura", "response": ["*Genius \u2013 Maurice Solovine (Alexander Vlahos)"]}, {"page": "La Ronde (play)", "response": ["in February 2017, a new adaptation written and directed by Max Gill was first staged at The Bunker Theatre, London.

Morgana claims to feel an inexplicable link with the boy which drives her to keep him safe. The Great Dragon later tells Merlin that Mordred will one day kill Arthur. Mordred is telepathic and calls Merlin \"Emrys\" [the Welsh form of Ambrose or Ambrosius, meaning \"Immortal\"], claiming he knows who Merlin is and that they are \"the same\". Despite the warning, Merlin eventually helps Morgana in a plan for Arthur to escape with the boy. He returns again in episode 2.3 when Morgana goes in search of the Druids. By way of her telepathic connection, he is able to sense that she has been stung by a giant scorpion and needs help. It is also shown that Mordred's magic is powerful enough to kill four or five armed soldiers with a single spell. He returns in \"The Witch's Quickening\" when he, allied with a group of renegades, seeks an ancient crystal with the ability to show the future, but he is forced to flee when the bandits are discovered. As he escapes, Merlin attempts to stop him by causing a branch to trip him up, but Mordred retaliates by impaling two knights in the back with spears, grimly informing Merlin that he will not forgive nor forget this. Mordred's trademarks are his icy blue glare and green cloak.
