Vale suffered four consecutive defeats, before managing to turn things around by the end of the month with 1\u20130 wins over Rotherham United and Plymouth Argyle. On 14 February, midfielders Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall joined the club on non-contract terms. However the treatment room grew more busy, as Adam Yates and Tom Pope picked up injuries requiring several weeks of rest. The club expected to receive a boost when Trinidad and Tobago international Chris Birchall returned from the Los Angeles Galaxy to play for the club on a month-by-month basis; however the club were hit by a transfer embargo by the Football League on 25 February for failing to pay a bill. Nevertheless performances on the pitch were solid, and Vale entered the Crewe derby having won four and drawn one of their last five games. The derby finished honours even again at 1\u20131, with a late header from Byron Moore cancelling out the own goal scored by Crewe skipper David Artell. A 2\u20131 home defeat by Barnet on 10 March ended Vale's run of eight game unbeaten; combined with a ten-point deduction for entering administration, the club slipped from 9th to 14th in the space of 24 hours. Promising young defender Lee Collins was the first the leave the club post-administration, joining Championship side Barnsley on a loan deal worth \u00a350,000 to the Vale on 15 March. The drama continued in the game against Shrewsbury Town on 27 March, as the match was abandoned after 64 minutes due to a fire caused by the failure of the floodlights at the New Meadow. With the season drawing to a close, Adams began developing his squad for the following season, and announced that he had 'reluctantly' released defender Charlie Raglan, without giving him his first team debut. He offered contracts to all but three players: Chris Martin, Phil Roe, and Paul Marshall; he also placed Burge on the transfer list. Aside from Lee Collins, the first player to reject a contract with Vale to move elsewhere was Anthony Griffith, who signed a two-year deal with League One side Leyton Orient. The first out-of-contract players to pledge their futures to Port Vale were Rob Taylor (two years), Lewis Haldane (six months), Ben Williamson (one year), and Sam Johnson (one year). Days later it was announced that Sean Rigg had signed with Oxford United, whilst Clayton McDonald confirmed that he would accept Vale's offer of a new one-year deal. However the biggest blow to fan's hopes of promotion came when it was announced that talismanic top-scorer Marc Richards had signed a two-year deal with relegated League One side Chesterfield. June began with John McCombe and Tom Pope both agreeing to sign new deals with the club.

For the Second Round clash with Walsall at the Bescot Stadium, Adams took the unusual move of naming his team a day in advance \"to allow Vale fans a fairer chance to decide whether they think it is worth making the short trip down the M6\". Nineteen-year-old goalkeeper Sam Johnson made his debut in the game, and was unable to prevent the two \"Saddlers\" goals in a 2\u20132 draw.

Having failed to hold down a first team place, especially with the tactical move away from wingers, Kaid Mohamed joined former club AFC Wimbledon on loan. They returned to form though in Burslem, recording a 3\u20131 victory over nearby Shrewsbury Town, and Adams said that the club had \"unearthed a gem\" after Hugill added Vale's third goal. The first big derby game against Crewe Alexandra came the following week, and the \"Railwaymen\" took the lead after 35 minutes only for Rob Taylor to mark his first appearance of the season by scoring the equalizing goal; Myrie-Williams scored the winning goal on 83 minutes which put Vale within one point of the play-offs whilst keeping Crewe second from bottom. However Vale fans were disappointed to see Preston North End win 2\u20130 at Vale Park despite playing with only ten men from the 12th minute of the game; it later transpired that the referee had sent off the wrong man, and that Neil Kilkenny was dismissed for striking Anthony Griffith when in fact the culprit was eventual double goalscorer Joe Garner.

Adams said this performance was as good as he had seen in an away game during his time as Vale manager. They remained unbeaten after picking up a 1\u20131 draw with Oldham Athletic at Boundary Park. Their unbeaten start to the season came to an end with a 2\u20130 home defeat to Notts County, with the Vale unable to turn round a 1\u20130 half-time deficit despite a strong attacking performance in the second half. To boost his attacking options, Adams then took in Blackburn Rovers striker Jordan Slew on loan until January. However Adams went on to bemoan defensive errors as Chesterfield left Burslem with a 2\u20131 win following a bad-tempered encounter upon Daniel Jones's return to Vale Park.

The clash with Rochdale on 15 November came amidst a defensive crisis as Streete was recalled from his loan and both Duffy and McGivern were suspended. The positive results kept coming however, as Vale moved into the top half of the table with a 1\u20130 win. Former Chelsea left-back Aziz Deen-Conteh then signed a deal with the club until 2017. Leaving the club, though only on a 28-day loan, was goalkeeper Sam Johnson, who went to Conference Premier side Alfreton Town.
