She also wrote a 750-word outline for a novel entitled Love All. Although it was disliked by publishers Blond & Briggs, the office secretary commented that she liked it, and it was picked up for publication. Her second novel was more sexually-oriented. Published in 1975, Up Tight was highly publicised, thanks to fashion photographer Harry Peccinotti's cover shot of a French model wearing see-through knickers; this jacket design resulted in booksellers Hatchards keeping it under the counter. After returning from living in New York City in 1980, she split from her second husband Patrick Hughes, and was again in need of funds to pay for her daughters' education. By the time her novel Breast Stroke was published in 1983, she had become an alcoholic. The three publications, plus various articles for men's magazines, earned her the position of 24th in Time Out magazine's review of London's best erotic writers."]}, {"page": "Frank Rocholl", "response": ["In February 2014 Rocholl will speak at the Quo Vadis Editorial Design Conference Munich, along with Harry Peccinotti, Mario Lombardo, Mirko Borsche, Wilhelm Vosskuhl and Rolf M\u00fcller."]}, {"page": "MediaWiki talk:Spam-blacklist/archives/February 2011", "response": [":::::#Harry Peccinotti"]}, {"page": "Be (Beady Eye album)", "response": ["The album (and subsequent single) artwork was designed by Trevor Jackson and features photographs by Harry Peccinotti, originally shot for NOVA Magazine.
