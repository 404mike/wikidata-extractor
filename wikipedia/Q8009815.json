A toolmaker by profession, he was an amateur painter whose recognition came in later life.\nTuck was adjudged to be the best artist in the water colour section at the seventh Exhibition of the South Eastern Federation of Art Societies at the Guildhall in London in 1957 and again in 1962. In 1974, at the age of 74, he displayed 50 paintings at the Passmore Edwards Museum in Romford when he was chairman of the South Eastern Federation of Art Societies. He twice had pictures accepted by the Royal Academy, but ultimately these were not hung.\nTuck painted English landscapes around Suffolk and Essex including Lavenham, Leigh-on-Sea, Heybridge, Tilbury and Maldon. However, many of his more colourful and lively paintings were on Mediterranean subjects in Malta, Cyprus and Spain. He also visited Portugal and the Loire, France. He always painted from life, never from photographs.\nTuck died on 11 January 1999 at the age of 98.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Tuck", "response": ["*William George Tuck (1900\u20131999), English watercolourist"]}, {"page": "Tuck (surname)", "response": ["* William George Tuck (1900\u20131999), English watercolourist"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 1999", "response": ["*William George Tuck, 98, English watercolour artist."]}]}}
