She was one of the leading stars of the Gainsborough melodramas of the 1940s such as The Man in Grey (1943) and was one of the most popular movie stars in Britain in the 1940s. She continued acting until some 50 years later.In the words of one account: \"Most of the time she drew what looked like the short straw, playing the 'good girl' in films that revelled in the exploits of her wicked opposite number, and it says much for her talent and charisma that she was able to hold attention in what must have seemed thankless parts \u2013 she herself acknowledged that 'I do think it is much more difficult to establish a really charming, nice person than a wicked one \u2013 and make it real'.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 18", "response": ["*1915 \u2013 Phyllis Calvert, English actress (d. 2002)"]}, {"page": "October 8", "response": ["*2002 \u2013 Phyllis Calvert, English actress (b. 1915)"]}, {"page": "Ingrid Bergman", "response": ["After Anastasia, Bergman starred in Indiscreet (1958), a romantic comedy directed by Stanley Donen.

The contract enabled Korda to lend Burton to films produced by other companies. Throughout the late 1940s and early 50s, Burton acted in small parts in various British films such as Now Barabbas (1949) with Richard Greene and Kathleen Harrison, The Woman with No Name (1950) opposite Phyllis Calvert, and Waterfront (1950) with Harrison. Burton had a bigger part as Robert Hammond, a spy for a newspaper editor in Green Grow the Rushes (1951) alongside Honor Blackman. His performance in Now Barabbas received positive feedback from critics. C. A. Lejeune of The Observer believed Burton had \"all the qualities of a leading man that the British film industry badly needs at this juncture: youth, good looks, a photogenic face, obviously alert intelligence and a trick of getting the maximum effort with the minimum of fuss.\" For The Woman With No Name, a critic from The New York Times thought Burton \"merely adequate\" in his role of the Norwegian aviator, Nick Chamerd.
