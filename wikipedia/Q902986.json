It uses magnetic deflection, where current passing through a coil placed in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet causes the coil to move. The modern form of this instrument was developed by Edward Weston, and uses two spiral springs to provide the restoring force. The uniform air gap between the iron core and the permanent magnet poles make the deflection of the meter linearly proportional to current. These meters have linear scales.  Basic meter movements can have full-scale deflection for currents from about 25 microamperes to 10 milliamperes."]}, {"page": "May 9", "response": ["*1850 \u2013 Edward Weston, English-American chemist (d. 1936)"]}, {"page": "Galvanometer", "response": ["===Edward Weston===", "Edward Weston extensively improved the design of the galvanometer. He substituted the fine wire suspension with a pivot and provided restoring torque and electrical connections through spiral springs rather than through the traditional wristwatch balance wheel hairspring. He developed a method of stabilizing the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, so the instrument would have consistent accuracy over time. He replaced the light beam and mirror with a knife-edge pointer that could be read directly. A mirror under the pointer, in the same plane as the scale, eliminated parallax observation error. To maintain the field strength, Weston's design used a very narrow circumferential slot through which the coil moved, with a minimal air-gap. This improved linearity of pointer deflection with respect to coil current. Finally, the coil was wound on a light-weight form made of conductive metal, which acted as a damper. By 1888, Edward Weston had patented and brought out a commercial form of this instrument, which became a standard electrical equipment component. It was known as a \"portable\" instrument because it was affected very little by mounting position or by transporting it from place to place. This design is almost universally used in moving-coil meters today."]}, {"page": "Weston", "response": ["* Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation, a company founded by Edward Weston "]}, {"page": "Film speed", "response": ["Before the advent of the ASA system, the system of Weston film speed ratings was introduced by Edward Faraday Weston (1878\u20131971) and his father Dr. Edward Weston (1850\u20131936), a British-born electrical engineer, industrialist and founder of the US-based Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation, with the Weston model 617, one of the earliest photo-electric exposure meters, in August 1932.
