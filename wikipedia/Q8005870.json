Dated 2 April 1874, the letter, received by Sydney clergyman William Branwhite Clarke, was written by W.P. Gordon, a station owner from the Darling Downs who had met Leichhardt in the days before his party vanished. The letter relates how Gordon moved to Wallumbilla and how, after living there for more than 10 years, he had befriended the Wallumbilla tribe who in time came to openly share their stories and folklore with him. One detailed story referred to the death of a white man who was leading a party of mules and bullocks along the Maranoa River many years earlier. According to the Wallumbilla, a large group of Aboriginals had encircled the party and murdered everyone in it. It has been speculated that if the story was true, the expedition's belongings were likely traded widely after the massacre, explaining how items that could only have come from Leichhardt's expedition were found in the Gibson Desert and why the rifle butt with the brass plate was found some 4,000 kilometres west of the Maranoa River."]}, {"page": "East Bergholt", "response": ["*William Branwhite Clarke (1798 \u2013 1878), geologist and clergyman."]}, {"page": "Alfred Ludlam", "response": ["Ludlam also found time to socialise while in Sydney and, on 1 October 1850, he married into Sydney's colonial establishment.
