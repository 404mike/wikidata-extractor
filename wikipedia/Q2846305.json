The name of the work's protagonist, \"Lord Ruthven\", added to this assumption, for that name was originally used in Lady Caroline Lamb's novel Glenarvon (from the same publisher), in which a thinly-disguised Byron figure was named Clarence de Ruthven, Earl of Glenarvon. Despite repeated denials by Byron and Polidori, the authorship often went unclarified.

The lead character, Lord Ruthven, was based on Byron. Polidori had previously worked as Byron's doctor and the two parted on bad terms. Much to Byron's annoyance, The Vampyre was widely attributed to him and even included in the third volume of Byron's works by popular demand. Polidori's tale was published by Henry Colburn on April 1st 1819, without Polidori's knowledge or permission. Polidori immediately wrote to Colburn stating that \u2018the tale of the Vampyre \u2013 which is not Lord Byron\u2019s but was written entirely by me at the request of a lady [\u2026] saying that she thought it impossible to work up such materials, desired I would write it for her, which I did in two idle mornings by her side.\u2019 The revelation caused a great scandal, and Polidori benefitted very little from it, either financially or personally.

Originally published anonymously, ostensibly by a so-called \"man of fashion,\" part 1 caused a considerable sensation in London society. Contemporary reviewers, suspicious of the numerous solecisms contained within the text, eventually identified the young Disraeli (who did not move in high society) as the author. Disraeli continued the tale in a second volume, also of 1826, and three subsequent volumes in 1827. The form in which Vivian Grey is published now is the revised 1853 edition, which was severely expurgated and, according to critic Wendy Burton, lost much of the charm and freshness of the 1826 edition.Wendy Burton, The Mask of Vivian Grey, (Kingston, 1976), 2.

Under Colburn's influence, the published novels adopted a standard format of three volumes in octavo, priced at one-and-a-half guineas (\u00a31 10s. 6d.) or ten shillings and sixpence (half a guinea) a volume. The price and format remained unaltered for nearly 70 years, until 1894. The price for a three-volume novel put them outside the purchase power of all but the richest households.
