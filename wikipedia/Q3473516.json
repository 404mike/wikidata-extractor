Wall's diplomatic career lasted more than thirty years, but his writing career as Sarban was brief and not prolific, ending during the early 1950s. Sarban is described in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy as \"a subtle, literate teller of tales, conscious of the darker and less acceptable implications that underlie much popular literature\". Wall cited the supernatural fiction of Arthur Machen and Walter de la Mare as influences on his work.", "link_mentions": {}}}
