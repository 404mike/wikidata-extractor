Hers was the idea to train nurses and create a professional nursing service. She travelled around New Zealand even while herself five months pregnant to gather support and encourage the formation of branches. Nine were formed by the time she returned to England in 1910. Her vision was to link these branches in one organisation based in Dunedin which would hold an annual conference. Centres in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch were used both for the babies that were failing to flourish, and for training camps for the nurses."]}]}}
