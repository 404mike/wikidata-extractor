Throughout the theatre's time at its first two venues, plays had largely been staged on a repertory basis, with plays being chosen and written around the actors available. After the move to the theatre's current venue in 1996, however, the system largely ended (apart from the 10\u00d710 season in 1998), with the theatre relying more on actors hired for single roles. Partly because of this, and partly because of the ongoing financial pressure on the theatre, in 2001 Ayckbourn chose to write a set of plays which could be performed by the same company of seven actors available at the time. This included three long-standing SJT performers (Robert Austin, Jacqueline King and Bill Champion), two recent additions (Alison Pargeter and Saskia Butler) and two newcomers (Beth Tuckey and Tim Faraday).Preface to Damsels in Distress, Alan Ayckbourn, London: Faber & Faber, Damsels in Distress History on official Ayckbourn siteAllen, Paul (2004) A Pocket Guide to Alan Ayckbourn's Plays, London: Faber & Faber, ", "| Alison Pargeter", "Alison Pargeter won Best Newcomer in the Critics' Circle Theatre Awards for her roles of Kelly Butcher, Rosie Seymour and Paige Petite.List of 2002 Critics' Circle awards on British Theatre Guide "]}, {"page": "Sugar Daddies (play)", "response": ["Ayckbourn wrote Sugar Daddies in early 2003, shortly after concluding his family play The Jollies and shortly before starting rehearsals for Tim Firth's The Safari Party.Allen, Paul (2004) A Pocket Guide to Alan Ayckbourn Plays Faber & Faber  In some respects, it can be considered a follow-on from the Damsels in Distress trilogy.Sugar Daddies history on official Ayckbourn site It again features a young female leading character in some kind of danger, and shares the theme of East End crime that frequently arose throughout the trilogy.

Although Ayckbourn has previously written plays with a specific set of actors in mind (the most recent example being RolePlay, written during rehearsals for two of the Damsels in Distress plays), the practice of writing for a specific actor was very unusual, and this play is regarded as the closest Ayckbourn has come to creating a role for an individual.", "The role chosen for Sasha, Alison Pargeter's character, concentrated heavily on the theme of self-delusion.
