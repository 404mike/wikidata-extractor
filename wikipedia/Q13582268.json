Her rebellious art, combined with her free-spirited lifestyle, has made Boty a herald of the 1970s feminism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carshalton", "response": ["*Pauline Boty, Artist"]}, {"page": "Alfie (1966 film)", "response": ["* British Pop Art artist, Pauline Boty, makes a brief appearance as the manageress of a Dry-Cleaner's whom Alfie visits for sex.

In 1961, he took a job teaching lithography at Croydon College of Art in London, where he would remain until 1963. Around this time, Jones was influenced by the works of writers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung. According to Jones, his 1963 painting Hermaphrodite, depicting \"fused male/female couples as metaphors of the creative act,\" draws from both Freud and Nietzsche.

A pioneering program, Monitor's editors encouraged Russell to be ambitious and the resulting film can also be seen as a collaboration, taking inspiration from the formal aesthetics and themes within work of its artist-subjects.  Like the work of Boshier, the film was a spliced and shuffled collage that startled its viewers.  Pop Goes the Easel established the similarities that united this group of pop artists while also establishing their differences.  Boshier emerged as relatively articulate and concerned with social issues and critical writings on the impact of advertising on social identity and democratic politics.  Though he used the materials of pop art such as flags maps and comics, we can see in his early work a marked political concern, especially with current events and expansion of American power.
