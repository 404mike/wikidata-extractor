The liquid is therefore in tension and sustains a longitudinal strain which, in the absence of disturbing factors, is insufficient to break the column of liquid\". But for siphons of small uptake height working at atmospheric pressure, he concluded that: \"... the tension of the liquid column is neutralized and reversed by the compressive effect of the atmosphere on the opposite ends of the liquid column.\""]}, {"page": "Pat O'Callaghan", "response": ["In the summer of 1928, the three O\u2019Callaghan brothers paid their own fares when travelling to the Olympic Games in Amsterdam.

Tootell was the first of the winners to have been born in the United States; the previous winners had all been Irish-American.
