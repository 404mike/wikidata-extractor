Vale's hard-working defensive five-some of Ray King (goalkeeper), Tommy Cheadle, Reg Potts, Stan Turner, and Roy Sproson were hailed as 'the Iron Curtain' or 'the Steele Curtain' (in honour of their manager). They finished top of the table with 69 points, eleven clear of second-placed Barnsley. Their 26 league goals conceded in a 46-game season was a record. Just five of these were conceded at home, another Football League record. This was based upon 30 clean sheets, again a Football League record.

They were undefeated at home all season, continuing a 42 match unbeaten run started on 8 November 1952, that would last until 18 September 1954. His team's achievements were built on a settled squad of nineteen players, twelve of which played regularly. However the greatest success came in the FA Cup, where they beat Darlington, Southport, Queens Park Rangers, First Division teams Cardiff City and Blackpool, and finally Leyton Orient to reach the semi-finals.

In the semi-final clash with West Bromwich Albion at Villa Park he was dispossessed for the \"Throstles\" equaliser and gave away the penalty for Albion's winning goal. Cheadle featured only 26 times in the Second Division in 1954\u201355. He played 19 games in 1955\u201356 and 14 games in 1956\u201357, as the club suffered relegation under new boss Norman Low.

The defence of Ray King, Stan Turner, Reg Potts, Albert Mullard, Tommy Cheadle and Roy Sproson was key to the \"Valiants\" success, missing just ten games between them.

With six of the final nine games at home, and all of the chasing pack yet to visit Burslem, the omens seemed good for promotion. Vale duly remained unbeaten until the season's end, however drawing five of these games proved not enough.

It was the end of an era, as the reputation of 'the Steele Curtain' had taken a severe blow, and its architect Freddie Steele left the club in January. The season was considered to be one where the old guard 'cracked', and thus many loyal servants of the club were let go in the summer of 1957, including Ray King, Reg Potts, Stan Turner, Tommy Cheadle, and Stan Smith.", "On 15 January, Steele resigned, saying \"I am quite prepared to face the consequences\". On 2 February, Nottingham Forest travelled to Vale Park with Eddie Baily, and demolished Vale 7\u20131 in a record defeat for the club at the stadium. A week later, the \"Valiants\" put three past Fulham at Craven Cottage, but failed to pick up any points as Ray King conceded six goals despite a brilliant performance. On 18 February, 42-year-old Norman Low of Workington Town took the \u00a32,000 a year job as Vale manager. Low had no interest in the tactics of the opposition, and simply told his players to 'entertain the public'. He was confident the players at his disposal could reach safety, despite the difficult situation they found themselves in. His first match in charge saw a 3\u20130 win over Grimsby Town which took them out of the relegation zone. Yet what followed was a club-record nine game losing streak that doomed their season, five of which were played in Burslem. Low experimented with his team by dropping King and Roy Sproson (on a run of 128 consecutive appearances), but all that resulted was a 6\u20130 hammering from Sheffield United. However it was their 1\u20130 defeat at Gigg Lane to struggling Bury that did more damage to their prospects of survival. During this spell Reg Potts made his 166th consecutive appearance, though Low put young reserves into the fray after all seemed lost. After relegation was confirmed, Vale seemed to play better with the pressure lifted, and picked up five points in their last three games, including a 2\u20132 draw at home to rivals Stoke City. Low also announced his plans to rebuild the club, initiating a lengthy series of schoolboy trials.", "On the financial side, 105,000 spectators had been lost from the previous season to an average of only 14,046, leaving an income from gate receipts of \u00a340,717.

The club's debts were worrying however, causing the club's directors to funnel \u00a32,500 of their own resources towards repaying this debt.
