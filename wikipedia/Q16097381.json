At 13, she started singing lessons at The Maurice Burman School of Modern Pop Singing, based in London's Baker Street, after the school produced singing star Alma Cogan. \"I had always wanted to be a singer. I had no desire to slavishly follow Alma's style, but chose the school merely because of Alma's success\", she said in a 1962 interview.Sunderland Echo, 6 June 1962, Interview with Shapiro, p. 7 Burman's connections included John Schroeder, a young songwriter and A&R man at EMI's Columbia Records, who recorded a demo of Shapiro singing \"Birth of the Blues\" and, motivated by her singing, signed her to the label.", "In February  1961, aged fourteen, Shapiro released her first single, \"Don't Treat Me Like a Child\".

After Helen's appearance on the ITV musical programme Thank Your Lucky Stars, the record took off and reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1961. According to AllMusic, Shapiro's rich and mature choice made her \"an extraordinary new phenomenon on the British pop scene.\" Her next single, the ballad \"You Don't Know\", topped the chart in August. The follow-up, \"Walkin' Back to Happiness\", was written written by John Schroeder and Mike Hawker and featured backing orchestrations by Norrie Paramor. The single quickly scaled the top of the chart with far greater sales than her last in October 1961, by which time Shapiro had turned 15. She had initially been reticent to record the song as she considered it old-fashioned and corny. Both of Shapiro's No. 1 singles sold over a million copies, earning her two gold discs.
