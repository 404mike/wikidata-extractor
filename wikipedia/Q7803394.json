He retired from teaching in 2016.\nA right-handed batsman, Curtis was a prolific scorer for Worcestershire and county captain between 1992 and 1995. He is one of only two players to score 10,000 one day runs for the county, and during the late 1980s he had a brief international career.\nAs cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, stated Curtis was \"a diligent, determined opener... brought in to stop the rot against the 1988 West Indians with about as much success as those who had gone before him\".Curtis was perhaps unfortunate to play in an era of very poor England performances and much was made of Curtis's batting stance and technique during his England career. In 1989, Terry Alderman frequently had Curtis lbw playing across the line and much of the TV media blamed this on his stance and backlift. This despite the fact that his opening partner Graham Gooch had a very similar set-up at the crease. While Curtis showed considerable patience and courage during his encounters with the West Indies, he looked highly suspect against Australia and at age 29 was not considered for the rebuilding process which England began under Graham Gooch's captaincy in 1990.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Grammar School Worcester", "response": ["*Tim Curtis (born 1960) Cricketer, former captain of Worcestershire.

As well as Cowdrey replacing Emburey, Gatting asked not to be considered for selection and the selectors also dropped Downton, Moxon, Capel, Defreitas and Childs in favour of Pringle, Neil Foster, Athey, Jack Richards, Tim Curtis and Robin Smith, with the last two set to make their Test debuts.

As such, players watch matches from a tent, which adjoined the scorers' and press tent in the south-west of the ground. On majotr matchdays the north-west of the ground was given to match sponsors and accommodated tents and a double-decker bus.

England needed solid partnerships and a good second innings score to fight their way back into the match, but received neither. Graham Gooch and Tim Curtis again opened the batting, but Curtis was out for a second ball duck caught by Boon who took a sharp chance close in at Bat-pad off Terry Alderman. A succession of regular wickets then ensued, England unable to put a partnership together.", "England were forced to face an awkward period before lunch, and duly obliged the tourists by succumbing to the pressure. Martyn Moxon fell to a third ball duck in the first over, caught by Waugh at point slashing at an out-swinger from Terry Alderman. Debutant Mike Atherton went two balls later, fooled by Alderman's now trademark in-swinging yorker which trapped him in front to be out LBW. England ended the first over 2 for 1. Tim Curtis fared little better, out a few overs later for 2, also out LBW to Alderman. Robin Smith and David Gower went someway to stabilising the England innings, but when captain Gower was tempted to play at an off-cutter outside the off stump by Geoff Lawson he got an outside edge and was caught behind for 11. Once again keeper Jack Russell was called upon to try to provide some lower order resistance for a failing England line-up. He did so, this time in the form of providing support for Smith, who started to look comfortable where the others had failed. Smith's stroke-play became audacious, even elegant at times. He soon moved past 50, but lost Russell soon after. The keeper-batsman caught behind by Healy off Lawson for 20. Hemmings likewise provided good support for Smith, chiming in with a useful 38, and helping Smith take the England total past 200 before he was spectacularly clean-bowled by Alderman. Smith soon crept over the line to make a well made century, but he was out 1 run later for 101, caught behind by Healy off Alderman, giving the West Australian yet another 5 wicket haul, his fifth of the series so far. Alderman finished the English first innings with 5 for 69."]}, {"page": "Paul Bent", "response": ["Bent never again played such a significant part in a season: he played no more List A games, and made only seven first-class appearances in 1990 and eight in his final year of 1991.
