He managed this by making threats to the victim by saying he would send their family or friends degrading info or revealing pictures of them (which he usually obtained earlier by obtaining a false trust with the victim) if they did not comply with his commands. Falder hid behind anonymous accounts on the web and then re-posted the images to gain a higher status on the dark web. Investigators said that he \"revelled\" in getting images to share on hurtcore websites. The National Crime Agency (NCA), described him as \"one of the most prolific and depraved offenders they had ever encountered.\"\nFalder pleaded guilty to 137 charges from 46 complainants, making him one of the UK's most prolific convicted sex offenders. In February 2018 he was jailed for 32 years and ordered to serve a further six years on extended licence. The Court of Appeal later reduced the term of imprisonment to 25 years, with an extended licence of 8 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Knutsford", "response": ["* Matthew Falder (born 1988/1989) a convicted English paedophile and blackmailer, lived in Knutsford"]}, {"page": "King's School, Macclesfield", "response": ["* Matthew Falder (born 1988), convicted child sex offender"]}, {"page": "Gumtree", "response": ["The convicted British online sex offender Matthew Falder approached most of his victims via Gumtree."]}, {"page": "Child sexual abuse in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*Matthew Falder (1989\u2013) - Falder was labelled as one of the most prolific and depraved offenders that the National Crime Agency (NCA) had ever encountered.
