They lost out on promotion to the old Division One by just one point. In 1974 Millwall hosted the first game to be played on a Sunday (against Fulham). To get around the law at the time, admission was gained by \"Programme Only\". On production of a matchday magazine, the bearer was then sold a team sheet bearing the words \"Official Programme\". The programme was sold for the same price as admission to the ground. Millwall repeated this exercise against Fulham on 25 April 1982, hosting the second game to be played on a Sunday."]}]}}
