Atkinson had been experimenting with persistent programming languages and was struggling to find a coherent model for a persistent Pascal variant. Morrison, whose interest in general-purpose programming had led to the development of S-algol, a general purpose teaching language, realised that S-algol's type system would more easily allow adding orthogonal persistence."]}, {"page": "Software Sustainability Institute", "response": ["The principal investigator of the project is Neil Chue Hong with support from co-investigators Malcolm Atkinson, Les Carr, David De Roure, Carole Goble, Simon Hettrick, Caroline Jay and Mark Parsons."]}]}}
