He made his debut when starting their 1\u20130 home defeat to Guiseley on 23 January 2016. He scored two goals in 20 appearances as Kidderminster were relegated in 23rd place. Whilst considering whether to accept Kidderminster's new contract offer or to play higher-level football, Lowe said it was \"a choice between my head and my heart\", implying his heart lay at Aggborough Stadium. He decided to remain with Kidderminster in part due to his reverence for manager John Eustace, signing a new contract in June 2016, and was named as club captain in August. Lowe scored five goals in 51 appearances in 2016\u201317, helping Kidderminster to a second-place finish before they suffered defeat in the play-off semi-final to sixth-place Chorley. He was named in the 2016\u201317 National League North Team of the Year, alongside teammates Zaine Francis-Angol and James McQuilkin. In June 2017, Lowe was told he could leave Kidderminster on a free transfer, but remained under contract at the club."]}, {"page": "List of foreign Scottish Premier League players", "response": ["*Zaine Francis-Angol \u2013 Motherwell \u2013 2012\u201313"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["| Zaine Francis-Angol"]}, {"page": "List of Motherwell F.C. players", "response": ["|style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|Zaine Francis-Angol||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|2011\u20132015||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|67||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|3||style=\"background:#FF9900;\"|"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["||| DF|| 26 ||Zaine Francis-Angol"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["|Zaine Francis-Angol"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Scottish Premiership players", "response": ["*Zaine Francis-Angol - Motherwell - 2013\u201315"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["|||DF||17||Zaine Francis-Angol", "| Zaine Francis-Angol"]}, {"page": "2019 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|LB ||3 || Zaine Francis-Angol "]}]}}
