Cherry Wilkinson, a fatuous female protagonist with a history of novel-reading, fancies herself as the heroine of a Gothic romance. She perceives and models reality according to the stereotypes and typical plot structures of the Gothic novel, leading to a series of absurd events culminating in catastrophe. After her downfall, her affectations and excessive imaginations become eventually subdued by the voice of reason in the form of Stuart, a paternal figure, under whose guidance the protagonist receives a sound education and correction of her misguided taste.Skarda (1986)."]}, {"page": "Pilot (disambiguation)", "response": ["* The Pilot (Dublin newspaper), published 1830s\u20131840s by Eaton Stannard Barrett's brother Richard"]}, {"page": "Beau Brummell", "response": ["In literature, Brummell has been more extensively portrayed.
