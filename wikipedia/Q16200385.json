Kieran Lee gave the visitors the lead on three minutes after pouncing on a mistake from Steele who failed to hold on to Stevie May's initial shot. Blackburn equalised when Rhodes nodded down into the path of Baptiste who wrapped his foot over the ball to fire past Westwood from 10 yards. Wednesday missed a glorious chance to retake the lead after 36 minutes when Glenn Loovens headed over a Royston Drenthe free-kick from five yards. Westwood kept the scores level in the second half when he saved a thunderous volley from Tunnicliffe and tipped over the crossbar. David Dunn then flashed a shot wide for Rovers before substitute Claude Dielna sealed the win for the visitors late-on. His 25-yard shot took a deflection as it flew past goalkeeper Jason Steele and secured a dramatic win for Stuart Gray's side. Next game was at Hillsborough against Wolves. The home side went close early on when Stevie May rounded Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme, only for Richard Stearman to clear his shot off the line. Loovens then rose to meet Chris Maguire's corner but headed inches wide and Royston Drenthe went just as close with a sweet volley. The game looked set to end goalless when Leon Clarke, who played for Wednesday between 2007 and 2010, buried the winner. Then The Owls faced a trip to London at Craven Cottage against Fulham. Tom Lees failed to get a good connection at the far post when free, before Marcus Bettinelli made a good save to keep out Chris Maguire's drive and Kostas Stafylidis cleared off the line from Stevie May. Fulham broke the deadlock in the 34th minute when McCormack fired in a superb free-kick after Glenn Loovens had conceded the foul. Hutchinson doubled the advantage when he nodded in from Bryan Ruiz's free-kick for his first goal for the club. The third came midway through the second half as Christensen converted from Hugo Rodallega's pass, before Woodrow added a fourth from the spot after Patrick Roberts had been fouled by Claude Dielna."]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["That proved to be enough for Shahid Khan to sack Magath, and announced that Kit Symons would temporarily assume caretaker manager whilst he appointed a five-man committee to find a new manager. Symons's first game in charge was against Blackburn Rovers. Symons made three changes \u2013 including Bryan Ruiz's first Fulham appearance since December 2013 \u2013 for a match attended by former captain Brede Hangeland, as well with former fan favourite Steve Sidwell, but as half-time approached, Hutchinson launched into an ill-advised, over-zealous challenge on Lee Williamson, leaving the midfielder in a heap. Referee Andy D'Urso gave a straight red card and, after several minutes of treatment, the Rovers man left the field on a stretcher. The sending off gave Rovers the upper hand and Rudy Gestede's attempt to find an opener at the start of the second half had to be well saved by the returning Marcus Bettinelli. Fulham soon had to scramble away a Craig Conway free-kick, before eventually falling behind in the 58th minute. Fulham refused to give in, though, and an excellent counter-attack involving Parker and Tim Hoogland would have been turned in by Ross McCormack was it not for a fine Steele save. Ruiz and Rodallega saw penalty appeals waved away soon after, before Blackburn came close in quick succession as Dan Burn blocked a Rhodes effort after rounding Bettinelli before a Gestede header deflected just wide.", "Fulham then progressed in the League Cup after seeing off Doncaster Rovers, courtesy of Bryan Ruiz and Dan Burn goals. This boosted morale for the trip to Saint Andrew's for the game against Birmingham City, who had only won one of their last 23 games at home. Fulham hardly began as a bottom of the table side, as demonstrated by Ross McCormack when he flashed in a free-kick which Darren Randolph had to desperately finger-tip away to safety. But it was Birmingham who then took command and David Cotterill, who had created numerous goal opportunities throughout the season, found himself in a goalscoring position when he latched onto a pass from Mark Duffy only to screw his effort wide with only goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli to beat. Fulham's problem was highlighted in the 19th minute when the industrious McCormack produced an accurate cross from the right only for Rodallega to fail to make a clean contact just yards away from the Birmingham goal. Birmingham continued to benefit from Cotterill's good delivery and another chance went begging as David Edgar headed wide from the former Burnley player's corner kick. Finally, in the 37th minute, they finally broke the stalemate with a solo goal. Callum Reilly pushed a pass into the path of Cotterill. He looked up and decided to fire in a shot from fully 25 yards which whistled into the top far corner of the net. Fulham were boosted by a 63rd-minute equaliser from Hoogland: Nikolay Bodurov's cross was deflected to Hoogland who saw his shot also deflected into the net. The winner came courtesy of a bad mistake by Jonathan Spector. He attempted to push the ball back to his goalkeeper only for the ball to cannon to Rodallega to capitalise upon the mistake and score with an angled shot after 71 minutes to give the whites their first win of the season in the League.", "|Marcus Bettinelli||5 December 2014|| vs Watford||1 Match||Leeds United (A) (Championship)"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Following the International break, Fulham arrived at Griffin Park for a Friday night televised match in front of a sell out crowd of 12,225. After a goalless first half, Fulham gained the lead against the run of play through Hugo Rodallega and continued to pressure for a second goal. Brentford sought an equaliser and were successful in the 81st minute when Harlee Dean unleashed a powerful shot from the edge of the penalty area to beat Marcus Bettinelli. The game seemed to be heading for a draw until Jota took an opportunistic shot that was deflected into the Fulham goal."]}]}}
