Despite the success of a vaccination programme reaching one million second doses in the country, with nearly a quarter of the adult population receiving both doses and over three-fifths having had their first dose, the vaccines that were approved (still largely Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca) required two doses and therefore many people were only partially protected. The vaccination programme still prioritised older age groups with invitations only starting to be sent out to those under 50 and there now started to be hospitalisations seen, including in younger age groups under 50.  As Moray, along with the rest of Scotland started to come out of a lockdown, for the first time with vaccinations present, the cases centred on the town started to rise and public health experts warned of \"uncontrolled, sustained community transmission\" of the virus. On 7 May 2021, it was revealed that Richard Lochhead, a minister in the Scottish Government who was, in the event, re-elected to the Scottish Parliament was unable to attend the count of the Moray constituency election as he was voluntarily self-isolating awaiting the results of a coronavirus test for a member of his family.", "Elgin is in the Moray constituency of the Scottish Parliament which has slightly different boundaries to the UK Parliament constituency of the same name.
