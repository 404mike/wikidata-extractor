The technique involves the application of backward pressure on the cricoid cartilage with a force of 20\u201344 newtons  to occlude the esophagus, preventing aspiration of gastric contents during induction of anesthesia and in resuscitation of emergency victims when intubation is delayed or not possible.  Some believe that cricoid pressure in pediatric population, especially neonates, improves glottic view and aids tracheal intubation apart from its classical role in rapid sequence intubation for aspiration prophylaxis."]}, {"page": "Sellick", "response": ["*Brian Arthur Sellick (1918\u20131996), British anesthesiologist"]}]}}
