Ronald Noonan criticises this account for anti-Chinese sentiment, noting that whenever referring to Poo's violence White uses the pejorative term \"Chinaman\". Next account of Poo is given by Robert Travers in his 1973 book Rogues' March: A Chronicle of Colonial Crime in Australia. In contrast to White's account, Travers depicts Poo as a moral avenger and as a traditional outlaw hero. Travers omits Poo's alleged threat to Elizabeth Golding and her daughter."]}]}}
