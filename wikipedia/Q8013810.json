The Royal Navy conducted a court-martial of the officers of Firebrand (a pro forma investigation required after the sinking or wrecking of any Royal Navy ship) and all were acquitted, but no officers survived from the other lost ships, so no other courts-martial took place. The Navy also conducted a survey of compasses from the surviving ships and of those at Chatham and Portsmouth dockyards, following comments from Sir William Jumper, captain of Lenox, that errors in the compasses had caused the navigational errors. The survey showed what a poor state many of the compasses were in; at Portsmouth, for example, only four of the 112 wooden-cased compasses from nine of the returning vessels were found to be serviceable."]}, {"page": "Yelsted", "response": ["Later, the house was passed to Sir William Jumper (commissioner of his Majesty's navy at Plymouth).
