He is regarded as one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time and was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002.Born in Birkenhead, he began his career at his hometown club Tranmere Rovers before moving on to Everton, the club he had supported as a child. A prolific goalscorer, he was particularly known for having a penchant for scoring goals with his head, courtesy of his elevation and athleticism, as well as his powerful and accurate heading ability, which has led pundits to describe him as one of the greatest aerial specialists of all time. Dean played the majority of his career at Everton before injuries caught up with him and he moved on to new challenges at Notts County. He is best known for his exploits during the 1927\u201328 season, which saw him score a record 60 league goals. He also scored 18 goals in 16 appearances for England.\nA statue of Dean was unveiled outside Goodison Park in May 2001. A year later, he became one of 22 players inducted into the inaugural English Football Hall of Fame. Dean was the first Everton player to wear the number-9 shirt.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 22", "response": ["*  1907   \u2013 Dixie Dean, English footballer (d. 1980)"]}, {"page": "March 1", "response": ["*  1980   \u2013 Dixie Dean, English footballer (b. 1907)"]}, {"page": "1980", "response": ["** Dixie Dean, English football player (b. 1907)"]}, {"page": "1907", "response": ["* January 22 \u2013 Dixie Dean, English football player (d. 1980)"]}, {"page": "1924", "response": ["* October 24 \u2013 Dixie Dean scores a hat-trick for Tranmere Rovers to become the youngest ever player to score three goals for The Superwhites."]}, {"page": "Tranmere Rovers F.C.", "response": ["In 1924, local youngster Dixie Dean made his debut aged 16 years 355 days.

He helped Everton win its third League Championship that season. However, Everton was relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and was promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division.
