The old parish church of St Tydfil, Merthyr Tydfil is dedicated to her and is reputed to be the site of her death.\nAccording to legend, Tydfil was the twenty-third daughter of Brychan, king of Brycheiniog, by his fourth wife. She was murdered with her brother Rhun in Merthyr Tydfil, by either Welsh or Saxon pagans, and buried in the town. No trace remains of her holy well Ffynnon Dydfil, which is thought to have been near the southern end of Well Street in Merthyr Tydfil. The daughter church of St Tydfil's Well is in the area of Merthyr Tydfil known as 'The Quar' (quarry). \nLlysworney Church in the Vale of Glamorgan is dedicated to this female saint, as was a chapelry of Llantwit Major until it was given to the Abbey of Tewkesbury.", "link_mentions": {}}}
