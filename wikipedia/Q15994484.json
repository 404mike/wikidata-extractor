In 1857, Claude Bernard (1813\u20131878) published the results of his experiments in which he demonstrated that the mechanism of action of curare was a result of interference in the conduction of nerve impulses from the motor nerve to the skeletal muscle, and that this interference occurred at the neuromuscular junction. From 1887, the Burroughs Wellcome catalogue listed under its 'Tabloids' brand name,  grain (5.4mg) tablets of curare (price: 8shillings) for use in preparing a solution for hypodermic injection. In 1914, Henry Hallett Dale (1875\u20131968) described the physiological actions of acetylcholine. After 25 years, he showed that acetylcholine is responsible for neuromuscular transmission, which can be blocked by curare.The best known and historically most important (because of its medical applications) toxin is d-tubocurarine. It was isolated from the crude drug \u2013 from a museum sample of curare \u2013 in 1935 by Harold King of London, working in Sir Henry Dale's laboratory. King also established its chemical structure. Pascual Scannone, a Venezuelan anesthesiologist who trained and specialized in New York City, did extensive research on curare as a possible paralyzing agent for patients during surgical procedures. In 1942, he became the first person in all of Latin America to use curare during a medical procedure when he successfully performed a tracheal intubation in a patient to whom he administered curare for muscle paralysis at the El Algodonal Hospital in Caracas, Venezuela."]}, {"page": "Lanning Roper", "response": ["In 1952 he married Primrose Harley (1908\u20131978) an artist, daughter of Professor Edward Vaughan Berkeley Harley MD MRCP (1863\u20131923) and Mary Blagden (1869\u2013?).
