The club reached the quarter-finals of the FA Amateur Cup, but lost 10\u20131 to Crook Town.

Two years later, Arsenal got to the Cup final again, this time against Newcastle United, but Barnes twisted his knee badly trying to tackle George Robledo and had to come off the pitch after 35 minutes; with no substitutes permitted, Arsenal were down to ten men, and went on to lose 1\u20130."]}, {"page": "Lionel Smith (footballer)", "response": ["Smith primarily played as a full back, but his initial chances were few and far between; Arsenal already had experienced full backs in Laurie Scott and Walley Barnes. Smith made his debut at centre half, deputising for Leslie Compton, in an 8\u20130 victory over Grimsby Town on 1 May 1948, the final match of their 1947-48 First Division-winning season. Smith finally gained a regular place at left back, after Scott suffered a series of injuries and Barnes switched sides to cover for him."]}]}}
