He had shaken off a minor hamstring injury which saw him have to be substituted during two run-outs in pre-season friendlies with Alfreton (against Sheffield United and Matlock Town). He debuted for the club in their 3\u20131 Conference defeat at his former club Kidderminster Harriers on 17 September 2011, scoring a 31st-minute penalty before attracting attention for an alleged elbow on Luke Jones. The incident was missed by the match referee but not by the referee's assessor who later requested a copy of the matchday DVD from Alfreton Town and, upon reviewing the incident, reported Broughton to the Football Association who took immediate action and banned him for three games. He returned from suspension to appear in the 5\u20132 defeat at Grimsby Town on 1 October 2011 but was sent-off for elbowing Gary Silk in the 86th minute. After being handed a four match ban for the offence, Broughton was sacked by the club on 5 October 2011, with Alfreton chairman Wayne Bradley commenting that \"the actions of Drewe Broughton on Saturday were wholly unacceptable and the club has made a decision to sever relationships with the player. He was a non-contract player and, while we understand his disappointment with himself and his pleas that it was completely out of character for him, we have made our decision and he has kicked his last ball for Alfreton Town\"."]}, {"page": "Gary Silk (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gary Silk"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Portsmouth F.C. season", "response": ["*  Gary Silk - released (later joined  Notts County"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Portsmouth F.C. season", "response": ["*  Gary Silk -  Boston United"]}, {"page": "Silk, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Silk"]}]}}
