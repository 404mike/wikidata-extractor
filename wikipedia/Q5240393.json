The Republic of China appealed to the League of Nations and the United States for assistance. The Council of the League asked the parties to withdraw to their original positions to permit a peaceful settlement. The United States reminded them of their duty under the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact to settle matters peacefully. Japan was undeterred and went on to occupy the whole of Manchuria. The League set up a commission of inquiry that condemned Japan, the League duly adopting the report in February 1933. In response, Japan resigned from the League and continued its advance into China; neither the League nor the United States took any action. However, the U.S. issued the Stimson Doctrine and refused to recognise Japan's conquest, which played a role in shifting U.S. policy to favour China over Japan in the late-1930s. Some historians, such as David Thomson, assert that the League's \"inactivity and ineffectualness in the Far East lent every encouragement to European aggressors who planned similar acts of defiance\".Thomson, David (1957) Europe Since Napoleon, London: Longans Green & Co. p. 691"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*David Thomson (Sidney Sussex)", "*David Thomson (Trinity), Canada's wealthiest family, Thomson Corp.
