This was achieved with impressive victories away to Bolton, and victories at home to Wrexham and (then) Premier League Nottingham Forest before the infamous semi-final tie with Middlesbrough at Old Trafford which ended in a 3\u20133 draw. Chesterfield even had a contentious goal that was not given by Referee David Elleray; Jonathan Howard took a shot which hit the underside of the crossbar and appeared to cross the line and yet the goal was never given. Had it been awarded as a goal it would have put Chesterfield 3\u20131 up against ten-man Middlesbrough (after the earlier dismissal of Vladim\u00edr Kinder) with just over 20 minutes remaining. As it was, Middlesbrough equalised to make it 2\u20132 after 90 minutes, and it finished 3\u20133 after extra time.

Writing in The Guardian, Cynthia Bateman described that the first half of the match was \"of such little excitement that the Chesterfield fans, too far away to take on the Cambridge supporters, began fighting among themselves\".  Keith Blackmore of The Times suggested that \"for a long time [the game] was not a good advertisement for fourth division football\". Although Cambridge had started the first half strongly, Chesterfield dominated the early stages of the second half.  In the 60th minute, Cambridge made the first substitution of the match with Claridge coming on to replace John Taylor.  Having missed several chances, Dublin scored in the 77th minute to give Cambridge the lead.

With six minutes of the match remaining, Cambridge made their second substitution, with Leadbitter being taken off for Mike Cook.  Chesterfield had chances to score through Plummer and Waller but to no avail.  In the 88th minute, Jamie Hewitt's header was saved by the Cambridge goalkeeper John Vaughan.
