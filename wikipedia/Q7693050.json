Low instead got 'bustling' Ted Calland on a free transfer from Exeter City, and sold Fred Donaldson to Exeter for \u00a32,000. In November he signed Bert Llewellyn from Crewe Alexandra for \u00a37,000. His team put in some memorable performances, including a 5\u20130 win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park, in what Roy Sproson later described as his 'greatest memory' and 'one of their finest hours'; the performance was so impressive they received 'a standing ovation' from the home crowd, as the \"Valiants\" finished the game 'rolling the ball about like a game of chess'. Vale were in the promotion hunt until late in the season, as Low released Albert Leake and sold Stan Steele to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a310,000. Vale recorded a seventh-place finish, and Low ended the campaign by releasing Harry Oscroft (Brantham Athletic), Ted Calland (Lincoln City), John Poole (Macclesfield Town), and Peter Hall (Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic)."]}, {"page": "Edward Calland", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Calland"]}, {"page": "Calland", "response": ["* Ted Calland (1932\u20131995), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw the club's management attempt to build a squad capable of promotion, this meant recruiting former Wales international inside-right Noel Kinsey from Birmingham City as a player-coach, and 21-year-old outside-left Dennis Fidler from the Manchester City Reserves.
