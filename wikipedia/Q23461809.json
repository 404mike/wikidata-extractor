He ventured into non-League football before being handed another opportunity in the Football League by Bristol Rovers. Again, he failed to break into the first-team, but a move to Southport saw him make his professional debut in 1937. Two years with Southport amounted to 32 appearances and a move to Plymouth Argyle, but World War II broke out before Miller could make any appearances for the club.\nMiller spent the war years making guest appearances for Aldershot, and finally made his debut for Plymouth in 1946. After injury interrupted his return, he made a move to Colchester United in 1948, where he played just twice before becoming a member of the club's coaching staff. He was briefly caretaker manager with Claude Orrin in early 1955.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Len Boyd", "response": ["He made his debut on 12 October 1946, taking over at centre-half from Alf Miller for a Second Division match away at Leicester City which Plymouth lost 4\u20131. In his first season, Boyd played 16 league matches, mainly in the inside left position, and scored four of his five Plymouth goals. He played regularly on the right side of the forward line in the following season, but failed to score, and was regarded as \"a promising but not exceptional inside-forward\". When manager Jack Tresadern switched him to right half for the 1948\u201349 season, it became clear he was better suited to that position. After three consecutive seasons helping the Devon club avoid relegation from the Second Division, Boyd was sold to First Division club Birmingham City in January 1949 for a fee of \u00a317,500, the first five-figure fee ever received by Plymouth for a player."]}, {"page": "Alfred Miller", "response": ["*Alf Miller (1917\u20131999), English footballer, mostly played for Southport and Plymouth Argyle "]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["During this transitional period, Orrin and Alf Miller took charge of the first-team, before appointing Benny Fenton as manager after attracting 48 applications for the vacancy.
