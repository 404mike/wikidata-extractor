Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from Encounter Bay in the south to Clare in the north.", "Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, Colonel William Light. His plan, sometimes referred to as \"Light's Vision\" (also the name of a statue of him on Montefiore Hill), arranged Adelaide in a grid, with five squares in the Adelaide city centre and a ring of parks, known as the Adelaide Parklands, surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there.Page, M. (1981): Port Adelaide and its Institute, 1851\u20131979. Rigby Publishers Ltd. Pp.17\u201320.  Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition. Recent evidence suggests that Light worked closely with George Kingston as well as a team of men to set out Adelaide, using various templates for city plans going back to Ancient Greece, including Italian Renaissance designs and the similar layouts of the American cities Philadelphia and Savannah\u2013which, like Adelaide, follow the same layout of a central city square, four complementing city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that surrounds the city centre."]}, {"page": "1830s", "response": ["* December 28, 1836 \u2013 Colony of South Australia founded by Captain John Hindmarsh"]}, {"page": "1836", "response": ["** The Colony of South Australia is founded by Captain John Hindmarsh."]}, {"page": "1785", "response": ["* May 22 \u2013 John Hindmarsh, English naval officer, first Governor of South Australia (d. 1860) "]}, {"page": "Heligoland", "response": ["* Rear Admiral Sir John Hindmarsh (1785\u20131860), veteran of the Battle of Trafalgar and first governor of South Australia, was the governor of Heligoland 1840\u201356.", "* 1840\u20131856: Sir John Hindmarsh"]}, {"page": "William Light", "response": ["Light helped Muhammad Ali to establish a modern navy, sailing his own yacht to England to help recruit British men for the Pasha's navy.

They had suffered a serious drop in numbers in the early 1830s (and possibly again in 1889) due to a smallpox epidemic which is thought to have originated in the eastern states and spread along the Murray River as Indigenous groups traded with each other. This devastated their lives in every way. An outbreak of typhoid, due to pollution by Europeans of the River Torrens, lead to many deaths and a rapid population decline, though accurate figures were not recorded. Many contracted other diseases against which they lacked immunity, such as measles, whooping cough, typhus, dysentery and influenza. The groups lost their identities as they merged with others, and the Kaurna and Ramindjeri people were reduced to very few.
