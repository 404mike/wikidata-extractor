He is noted for his research on the neurobiological and biosocial causes of antisocial and violent behavior in children and adults. He was the first scientist to use neuroimaging to study the brains of murderers.

Lombroso conducted a postmortem on a serial killer and rapist, who had an unusual indentation at the base of the skull. Lombroso discovered a hollow part in the killer's brain where the cerebellum would be. Lombroso's theory was that crime originated in part from abnormal brain physiology and that violent criminals where throwbacks to less evolved human types identifiable by ape-like physical characteristics. Criminals, he believed, could be identified by physical traits, such as a large jaw and sloping forehead. The contemporary neuroscientists further developed his idea that physiology and traits of the brain underlie all crime. The term \u201cneurocriminology\u201d was first introduced by James Hilborn (Cognitive Centre of Canada) and adopted by the leading researcher in the field, Dr. Adrian Raine, the chair of the Criminology Department at University of Pennsylvania.
