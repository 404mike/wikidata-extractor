He is currently an academy coach at Lewes and was Interim Manager at Crawley Town F.C. alongside Gary Alexander, following the sacking of manager Richie Barker.\nHinshelwood was born in Reading, but grew up in Croydon, and in 1969, (along with his brother Paul) played in the final of the London FA Schools Cup, watched by then Crystal Palace manager Arthur Rowe. Rowe was impressed, and the brothers were invited for trials with the club. Both performed well, and were taken on as apprentices.\nMartin Hinshelwood played in the centre of midfield, and quickly fought his way into the team, while his brother initially languished in the lower echelons of the club.Hinshelwood was part of the team that reached the semi-final of the 1976 FA Cup, and played in the defeats of Leeds United, Chelsea, and Sunderland (all away from home). In the semi-final game, Third Division Palace were drawn against Second Division Southampton. Despite the Saints being a tier above the Eagles, Palace were cast as favourites. Martin missed the game through injury, and some see this as the reason that Southampton beat Palace by two goals to nil.That injury proved to dominate Hinshelwood's career, and it eventually led to his retiring from the game, in late 1977. He briefly played again as player/manager at Leatherhead F.C. in the Isthmian Premier in 1980/81 and 81/82 taking over from long serving Manager Billy Miller.He went into management in later years at Palace's arch-rivals Brighton & Hove Albion. He originally began as the youth coach, but when Micky Adams departed following promotion, he was appointed caretaker manager, along with Bob Booker. Ex-Palace teammate Peter Taylor succeeded Adams, and guided Albion to another successive promotion. He too then left the manager's post, and this time Hinshelwood stepped up to the position on a full-time basis. Brighton were then in Division One. However, after losing twelve games consecutively, he was moved to director of football, and Steve Coppell came in as manager. Albion were relegated, though Coppell nearly achieved the impossible in keeping the club up. With the departure of Albion manager Russell Slade in November 2009, Hinshelwood was again appointed caretaker manager.\nHinshelwood's family also have a strong footballing background. His father Wally was a professional footballer in the 1950s, most notably at Reading and Bristol City. His brother Paul had a long career at Crystal Palace and also represented the England under-21 team. Martin's son Danny had a brief professional career, and his nephews (Paul's sons) Adam and Paul are professionals at Brighton and Torquay, respectively.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.", "response": ["*  Martin Hinshelwood 2002"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 in English football", "response": ["* 15 July - Youth director Martin Hinshelwood takes over at Brighton & Hove Albion, replacing Peter Taylor (resigned 29 April)"]}, {"page": "Steve Coppell", "response": ["After a brief stint as assistant manager to Andy King at Swindon Town, Coppell took over as manager at Brighton.

However, Brighton made a terrible start to the 2002\u201303 Division One campaign, after winning their first game 3\u20131 away at Burnley followed by a 0\u20130 draw against Coventry they set a record losing sequence losing 12 games in a row, including a 5\u20130 defeat by bitter rivals Crystal Palace on 26 October. Hinshelwood then became Director of Football and Steve Coppell was handed the manager's duties after the 10th defeat of the run. Coppell's spell started very brightly with a 2\u20130 half time lead against Sheffield United, however some questionable refereeing decisions led to Brighton losing 4\u20132, the 12th and final defeat in the streak. Brighton stopped the slump by beating Bradford 3\u20132 at Withdean and continued to improve substantially under Coppell and looked as though they might be able to pull off a miracle survival. Although the great escape eventually proved beyond them, Brighton gained some satisfaction by staying alive until the last game of the season, a 2\u20132 draw at Grimsby. It was at the end of this season that Bobby Zamora, who had been in the double championship winning side and top goalscorer during this period, was sold to Tottenham for a \u00a31,500,000 fee."]}, {"page": "Danny Hinshelwood", "response": ["His father Martin Hinshelwood played professionally for Crystal Palace, among others, and was Brighton's Director of Youth Football while he was at the club.
