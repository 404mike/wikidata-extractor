Additionally, he is a chartered psychologist, an author and lecturer. He currently specialises in non-invasive techniques for measuring human responses under real life conditions. The studies started in the early 1980s while he was a doctoral student at the University of Sussex and required him to develop both the hardware and software necessary to monitor and record electrical activity in the brain.\nHe has a first-class honours degree in psychology and biology from the University of Westminster and a doctorate from the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Sussex, where he lectured in clinical psychology and psychopathology before setting up his own research organisation.He is the author of books covering a range of psychological topics, a lecturer and Sony award-winning broadcaster for a BBC Radio 5 Live series on the psychological relationships between sports stars and their mentors and trainers.In the early 1990s his work was featured on BBC TV's Tomorrow's World.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of psychologists", "response": ["* David Lewis"]}, {"page": "Neuromarketing", "response": ["The term \"neuromarketing\" was first published in 2002 in the Master ThesisPublic defense on December 12, 2002, under the direction of Pr.

The chapter \"Capitalism II : Infocapitalism (experience)\" contains a development with sub-chapter Hyper-rational Anticipation: Neuroscience and Neuromarketing. The same year, the term \"neuromarketing\" was published in an article by BrightHouse (after contacting Ass. Pr. Morel about this topic), a marketing firm based in AtlantaAit Hammou, Galib & Melloul, 2013 and used by Dutch marketing professor Ale Smidts. BrightHouse sponsored neurophysiologic (nervous system functioning) research into marketing divisions; they constructed a business unit that used fMRI scans for market research purposes. The firm rapidly attracted criticism and disapproval concerning conflict of interest with Emory University, who helped establish the division. This enterprise disappeared from public attention and now works with over 500 clients and consumer-product businesses. The \"Pepsi Challenge\", a blind taste test of Coca-Cola and Pepsi, was a study conducted in 2004 that brought attention to neuromarketing. In 2006, Dr. Carl Marci (US) founded Innerscope Research that focused on Neuromarketing research. Innerscope research was later acquired by the Nielsen Corporation in May 2015 and renamed Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience. Unilever's Consumer Research Exploratory Fund (CREF) had also published white papers on the potential applications of neuromarketing.David Lewis & Darren Brigder (July\u2013August 2005). \"Market Researchers make Increasing use of Brain Imaging\" (PDF).
