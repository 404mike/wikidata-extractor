It passed through several hands until 1835, when it was bought by Jeremiah Penny.

The ornamental domes of box were planted in the 1920s. The early landscaping was expanded and planted starting in 1933 by Phyllis Reiss in an Arts and Crafts \"Hidcote\" style. The  garden is separated into \"rooms\" by Yew hedges and walls. The different areas include Eagle Court (the former courtyard), Middle Garden, Fountain Garden and Pool Garden. The pool garden is the site of a former tennis court."]}, {"page": "Penelope Hobhouse", "response": ["In 1980 she and her husband Prof John Malins moved into Tintinhull Gardens.
