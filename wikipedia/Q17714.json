Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.\nHawking was born in Oxford, into a family of physicians.  In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford,  where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \u2013 ALS, for short) that gradually, over the decades, paralysed him. After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Asteroid", "response": ["In April\u00a02018, the B612 Foundation reported \"It is 100\u00a0percent certain we'll be hit [by a devastating asteroid], but we're not 100\u00a0percent sure when.\" Also in 2018, physicist Stephen Hawking,"]}, {"page": "Artificial intelligence", "response": ["Superintelligent AI may be able to improve itself to the point that humans could not control it.

In 1981, Alan Guth made a breakthrough in theoretical work on resolving certain outstanding theoretical problems in the Big Bang theory with the introduction of an epoch of rapid expansion in the early universe he called \"inflation\".

However, in the late 1960s Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking used global techniques to prove that singularities appear generically. For this work, Penrose received half of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics, Hawking having died in 2018.

This hypothesis relies on the vast size and consistent physical laws of the observable universe. According to this argument, made by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, as well as notable personalities such as Winston Churchill, it would be improbable for life not to exist somewhere other than Earth. This argument is embodied in the Copernican principle, which states that Earth does not occupy a unique position in the Universe, and the mediocrity principle, which states that there is nothing special about life on Earth. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10\u201317 million years old. Life may have emerged independently at many places throughout the universe, as it arose on Earth roughly 4.2 billion years ago through chemical processes. Alternatively, life may have formed less frequently, then spread\u2014by meteoroids, for example\u2014between habitable planets in a process called panspermia.

Gardner also claimed that most physicists favour the unreal interpretation, whereas the \"realist\" view is supported only by MWI experts such as Deutsch and DeWitt. Gardner reports Hawking saying that MWI is \"trivially true\". In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded MWI as \"self-evidently correct\" but was dismissive of questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, \"When I hear of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, I reach for my gun.\" In the same interview, he also said, \"But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities\u2014in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many-worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities.\" Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the \"reality\" of physical theories with that of his colleague Roger Penrose, saying, \"He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me.

Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking have shown that black holes have the maximum possible entropy of any object of equal size.

A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the quantum harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, and diatomic molecule problems and gave a new derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of his approach to that of Heisenberg and gave the treatment of the Stark effect. A fourth paper in this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering problems. In this paper he introduced a complex solution to the wave equation in order to prevent the occurrence of fourth and sixth order differential equations.
