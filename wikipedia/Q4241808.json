Kara\u0111or\u0111e is referenced in a number of works of 19th-century fiction. While he was still alive, the Hungarian dramatist  wrote a stage play about him, titled Black George, which premiered in August 1812. Several years later, the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin penned a ballad about Kara\u0111or\u0111e titled The Song of George the Black. The Irish poet George Croly also wrote a ballad about him. Kara\u0111or\u0111e is mentioned in Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's 1842 novel A Start in Life, as the grandfather of one of the book's main characters. The Montenegrin prince-bishop and poet Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dedicated his 1847 epic poem The Mountain Wreath to \"the ashes of the Father of Serbia\", a reference to Kara\u0111or\u0111e. The surname Karamazov, used in the Russian writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 1880 novel The Brothers Karamazov, is believed to have partially been inspired by Kara\u0111or\u0111e, whose exploits popularized the use of the prefix \"kara\" to mean \"black\" within Russia."]}, {"page": "Regnal number", "response": ["After the realms were united with the Acts of Union 1707, separate numbers were not needed for the next five monarchs: Anne and the four Georges. However, when William IV acceded in 1830, he was not called William III in Scotland.

Nor were Edward VII and Edward VIII known as Edward I and Edward II (or possibly II and III, if one counts the disputed reign of Edward Balliol) of Scotland.  These kings all followed the numbering consistent with the English sequence of sovereigns (which, incidentally, was also the higher of the two numbers in all occurring cases).  This was not without controversy in Scotland, however; for example, Edward VII's regnal number was occasionally omitted in Scotland, even by the established Church of Scotland, in deference to protests that the previous Edwards were English kings who had \"been excluded from Scotland by battle\".

Vega is rendered decidedly oblate by its rapid rate of rotation, and since it is pole-on to the sun, it appears significantly larger to earthbound observers than it actually is.
