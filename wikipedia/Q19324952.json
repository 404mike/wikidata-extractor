During his early years as a curate he suffered a crisis following the death of his first child.  One of his parishioners suggested he study a volume of sermons by the Rev John Hill (1711-46).  As he read his well-being improved and he started to question some of the doctrinal beliefs in the Church of England.  He shared these ideas with his congregation, causing a split in the community and was asked by his rector to leave.  Within a few years he became a Baptist minister and the pastor of John Street Chapel in Bloomsbury, where he remained for thirty years.
