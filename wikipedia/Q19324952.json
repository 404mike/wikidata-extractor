During his early years as a curate he suffered a crisis following the death of his first child.  One of his parishioners suggested he study a volume of sermons by the Rev John Hill (1711-46).  As he read his well-being improved and he started to question some of the doctrinal beliefs in the Church of England.  He shared these ideas with his congregation, causing a split in the community and was asked by his rector to leave.  Within a few years he became a Baptist minister and the pastor of John Street Chapel in Bloomsbury, where he remained for thirty years.  After his death it was said of him that, he was to be admired in almost everything except his Nonconformity.", "link_mentions": {}}}
