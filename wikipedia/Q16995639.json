After gathering support of major BBC Radio 1 DJs such as Annie Mac, Pete Tong and Skream, one half of the duo was featured on Tong's show as part of the 'Future Stars' segment. Shortly after their release on Love & Other entitled 'Ballin', they were heavily featured across various shows on BBC Radio 1, including mixes for Annie Mac, Pete Tong, Annie Nightingale, Skream, B.Traits and MistaJam.
