Her feminist viewpoint helped shape the band's early political stance and she was one of the very few Fall members, other than frontman Mark E. Smith, who contributed lyrics to the group\u2019s songs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Fall (band)", "response": ["The Fall was formed in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, in 1976 by Mark E. Smith, Martin Bramah, Una Baines and Tony Friel. The four friends would meet to read their writings to each other and take drugs. Their musical influences included Can (which the band would later pay tribute to on the track \"I Am Damo Suzuki\"), the Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart and garage rock bands like the Monks and The Stooges. The members were devoted readers, with Smith citing H. P. Lovecraft, Raymond Chandler and Malcolm Lowry among his favourite writers. After seeing Sex Pistols play their second gig at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in July 1976, they decided to start a group. Smith wanted to name the group \"The Outsiders\", but Friel came up with the name \"The Fall\" after a 1956 novel by Albert Camus. Smith became the singer, Bramah the guitarist, Friel played bass guitar and Baines bashed biscuit tins instead of drums; unable to afford to buy a drum kit, she then switched to keyboards. Their music was intentionally raw and repetitive. The song \"Repetition\", declaring that \"we've repetition in the music, and we're never going to lose it\", served as a manifesto for the Fall's musical philosophy.", "The Fall's line-up underwent its first drastic changes in 1977\u201378. Kay Carroll, Una Baines's friend and colleague at the psychiatric hospital, became the group's manager and occasional backing vocalist, as well as Smith's girlfriend. Friel, unhappy with Carroll's management, left in December 1977 (he went on to form the Passage with Dick Witts). He was briefly replaced by Jonnie Brown, and later by Eric McGann (also known as Eric the Ferrett). The Fall were filmed on 13 February 1978 for the Granada TV show What's On, hosted by Tony Wilson, performing \"Psycho Mafia\", \"Industrial Estate\" and \"Dresden Dolls\", featuring the brief line-up of Smith, Bramah, Burns, Baines and McGann. Baines left in March 1978 after a drug overdose and subsequent nervous breakdown, and was replaced by Yvonne Pawlett; McGann quit that May, in disgust at the group's van driver Steve Davies wearing a Hawaiian shirt as he ferried them to the recording of their first-ever session for influential radio DJ John Peel. (The Fall would record a total of 24 sessions for Peel, who became a devoted fan of the group.) Martin Bramah blamed the dissolution of the original line-up on Smith's style of leadership, together with Carroll's favouring of her partner: \"The break-up wasn't so much about the music, though; it was more how we were being treated as people on a daily basis.\" 16-year-old Marc Riley, the group's roadie, was eventually recruited to the group to play bass guitar.", "Bingo-Master's Break-Out! finally was released in August 1978 on Step Forward Records. The single \"It's the New Thing\" followed in November 1978, and in December the Fall recorded (in a single day) their debut album Live at the Witch Trials, which was released in March 1979. Burns quit the group shortly after the album was recorded, and was replaced by Mike Leigh from Rockin' Ricky, a cabaret band. In April 1979, Burns was followed by Martin Bramah, co-writer of most of the songs on Live at the Witch Trials and, according to writer Daryl Eslea, \"possibly the last true equal to Smith in the group\"; he went on to form Blue Orchids with Una Baines. Marc Riley switched from bass guitar to guitar, and Craig Scanlon (guitar) and Steve Hanley (bass guitar), former bandmates of Riley and members of Fall support act Staff 9, joined the group. Hanley's melodic basslines became a vital part of the Fall's music for almost two decades. Smith praised his playing in Melody Maker: \"The most original aspect of the Fall is Steve\u00a0... I've never heard a bass player like him\u00a0... I don't have to tell him what to play, he just knows. He is the Fall sound.\" Yvonne Pawlett left in July 1979 to look after her dog. She later appeared in a band called Shy Tots."]}, {"page": "Mark E. Smith", "response": ["He has said that he didn't become interested in music until he was about 14, when he discovered Captain Beefheart. He attended Sedgley Park Primary School, and later Stand Grammar School for Boys before quitting aged 16. That year, he left home and moved in with his girlfriend and future Fall keyboardist, Una Baines, later of the Blue Orchids. He subsequently took an evening class in A-level Literature. His first job was in a meat factory, before he became a shipping clerk on Salford docks.", "The Fall were named after the novel by Albert Camus, and initially consisted of Smith and his friends Martin Bramah, Una Baines and Tony Friel.

Retrieved 24 January 2018 He gave up his job as a shipping clerk at Salford docks shortly afterward to devote his full energies to the band. Their early line-up was formed from early members of the punk rock movement. However their music underwent numerous stylistic changes, often concurrently with changes in the group's lineup. The Fall's 40-year career can be broken into five broad periods, based on the band's membership. These include their early late 1970s line-up, the classic Fall period of Hanley and dual drummers, the Brix years of 1984-89, their early 1990s revival, and everything after the on-stage fight in New York, after which Hanley quit and Smith was arrested (see below)."]}, {"page": "Una", "response": ["*Una Baines (born 1957), British keyboard player and member of The Fall"]}, {"page": "Live Heroes", "response": ["*Una Baines \u2013 keyboards"]}, {"page": "Live at the Witch Trials", "response": ["Some of the songs date from earlier incarnations of the group and feature writing credits from former members Tony Friel and Una Baines.
