The premiere took place on February 24, 1876. More memorably, she is said to have later hid behind the curtains in Act Four and performed \"Solveig's Song\" because Thora Hansson, who played the role of Solveig, had a rather rough voice. Hansson sat on a rock and lip-synced while the audience wondered how she was able to sing with such a clear voice. It was the head of the Ibsen Museum in Oslo, Erik Henning Edvardsen, who told the author Lucinda Riley in the 2010s how Wiese stood in the curtains and performed Hansson's song. The story thus took its fictionalized literary form in the novel The Storm Sister."]}, {"page": "2021 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*11 June \u2013 Lucinda Riley, Northern Irish author and actress (Auf Wiedersehen, Pet), oesophageal cancer (b. 1965)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2021", "response": ["*Lucinda Riley, 55, Northern Irish author and actress (Auf Wiedersehen, Pet), oesophageal cancer.Lucinda Riley er d\u00f8d "]}, {"page": "2021 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["11 June - Lucinda Riley (b 1966), author"]}, {"page": "List of women writers (M\u2013Z)", "response": ["*Lucinda Riley (1966\u20132021, Ireland), fiction wr."]}]}}
