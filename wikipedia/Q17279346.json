Despite suffering early exits in the two cup competitions, Hibs qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by finishing third in the Scottish League. During that first season, MacFarlane's team set a club record for consecutive wins. Hibs beat Malm\u00f6 and Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es to progress to the third round of the Fairs Cup, where they would lose to Bill Shankly's Liverpool side.
