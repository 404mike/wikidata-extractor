Explaining the storyline, Paul Marquess said: \"Hollyoaks has long been credited for tackling difficult issues that affect young people in a sensitive and intelligent way.

The storyline very clearly communicates to the audience that Amber and Finn were not emotionally or physically ready to engage in any sexual activity.
