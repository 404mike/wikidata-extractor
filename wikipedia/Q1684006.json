He is best known for installing site-specific underwater sculptures that develop into artificial coral reefs, which local communities and marine life depend on. Taylor integrates his skills as a sculptor, marine conservationist, underwater photographer and scuba diving instructor into each of his projects. By using a fusion of Land Art traditions and subtly integrating aspects of street art, Taylor produces dynamic sculptural works that are installed on the ocean floor to encourage marine life, to promote ocean conservation and to highlight the current climate crisis.\nTaylor's works in Grenada have been listed among the Top 25 Wonders of the World by National Geographic. His projects to date include the creation of the Canc\u00fan Underwater Museum, Ocean Atlas, and the installation of Museo Atl\u00e1ntico, the first underwater museum in Europe and in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Lanzarote, Spain. Taylor has received four Guinness World Records, one of which was awarded in February 2021 for creating the most underwater artworks in the world.", "link_mentions": []}}
