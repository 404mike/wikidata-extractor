His musical style has included folk, blues, psychedelia, pop and punk rock and his live performances are punctuated with his dry humour and onstage wit. He is known for virtuoso fiddle playing, ability with a great number of stringed instruments, and playing slide guitar with a whole raw egg (known as egg-necking). During recent Otway/Barrett performances, he has also introduced the 'wah wah wheelie bin'.\nBarrett is also a skilled wood worker and carver and has produced highly unusual furniture over many years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Otway", "response": ["Otway was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Although his first single, \"Gypsy\"/\"Misty Mountain\" was released in 1972, Otway initially received some coverage on the back of punk rock and a performance on The Old Grey Whistle Test. His sixth single, the half-spoken love song \"Really Free\" reached number 27 in the UK Singles Chart in 1977. It would be his greatest success for some time. The song earned him a five-album deal with Polydor Records, who viewed him as a punk rather than merely an eccentric. His first album, recorded with Wild Willy Barrett, was produced by Pete Townshend but sold only fitfully. The follow-up singles fared no better despite some imaginative promotion, which included an offer for Otway to come to a buyer's house and perform the 1979 single, \"Frightened and Scared\", if their copy was one of only three copies from which the vocal had been omitted. Otway's and Barrett's only other UK chart success came in July 1980 with \"DK 50/80\", a modest No. 45 hit.", "Otway is still touring in various formats. In 2009, he was re-united with Wild Willy Barrett for a UK tour, the duo now perform together regularly and even recorded a new album in 2011 called 40-Odd Years of Otway and Barrett consisting of re-workings of old songs and a new, previously unrecorded song \"The Snowflake Effect\". Otway also tours as a solo act, as a duo with Richard Holgarth and often with his Big Band which includes Murray Torkildsen (guitar and stylophone), Seymour Fluids (bass), Adam Batterbee (drums) and guest keyboard player Barry Upton.", "| John Otway & Wild Willy Barrett", "| Wild Willy Barrett", "| Wild Willy Barrett", "| Wild Willy Barrett", "| Wild Willy Barrett", "| Wild Willy Barrett", "| Wild Willy Barrett", "| John Otway & Wild Willy Barrett (Live to Disc)", "| Wild Willy Barrett"]}, {"page": "Lol Coxhill", "response": ["* John Otway & Wild Willy Barrett, Way & Bar (Polydor, 1980)"]}, {"page": "New Cross", "response": ["During the 1980s, the Goldsmiths Tavern hosted alternative cabaret nights, organised by Nikky Smedley.
