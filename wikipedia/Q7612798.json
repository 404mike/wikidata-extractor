In 1997 with David Cowham he founded loans.co.uk, a Watford headquartered finance broker. Hayes became Chief Executive, expanding the firm to become the UK's then leading finance broker, on an earnings package of \u00a35.5million in 2004/2005. In June 2005, Cowham and Hayes sold loans.co.uk to MBNA for an undisclosed amount, reported to be worth \u00a350million to each partner.\nHayes became a 25% shareholder through an initial \u00a3250,000 investment in Wycombe Wanderers in June 2004, when the football club became a plc, and later became managing director. Hayes bought an 11.6% stake in London Wasps Holdings Ltd in August 2007, and became chairman of Lawrence Dallaglio's benefit committee. In December 2008, Hayes bought Chrysalis Records founder Chris Wright's controlling interest and John O'Connell's shareholding in London Wasps to take complete control, and in July 2009, following a shareholders' meeting, he took full ownership of Wycombe Wanderers, in the process writing off \u00a33m of the club's debt to him in exchange for shares.\nBetween 2009-2012 Hayes\u2019 plan to build a new 17,500 stadium and destination venue, on Booker Airfield High Wycombe, for both clubs, was backed by Wycombe District Council. When Lesley Clarke stepped down as Leader, his replacement Alex Collingwood led a successful campaign against the plans.\nIn June 2012, Hayes sold the football club to Wycombe Wanderers Trust and the rugby club to David Thorn.\nBetween 2014-2020, Hayes was Chairman and a founding shareholder of Open Property Group that became the most successful cash property buyers in the UK, creating a portfolio of 100+ rental properties, worth in excess of \u00a310M.\nSince 2018 Hayes has been running Open Limited, his own small property development business, whilst also active as a non-executive director to several other SMEs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "MBNA", "response": ["At the same time in June 2005, MBNA bought Loans.co.uk (LCUK), then the United Kingdom's leading finance broker.

As bottom half finishes continued, Sanchez was eventually sacked in September 2003 after the club ended the previous campaign in 18th. His successor Tony Adams failed to turn things around, and Wycombe ended a 10-year stay in the Second Division at the end of 03\u201304, finishing bottom of the league and suffering relegation to the Third Division, then renamed as the Coca-Cola League Two. At the time, the Wanderers were English football's last professional members' club, but at an extraordinary general meeting in July 2004, the members voted by a narrow margin to restructure the club as a Public Limited Company. Chairman Ivor Beeks, Director Brian Kane and sponsor Steve Hayes all subsequently invested in the club, with an approximate total value of \u00a3750,000.", "Peter Taylor was appointed as his successor in May 2008 and he led the side to another lengthy unbeaten start which lasted 18 games. The side was nine points clear at the top at Christmas but results soon tailed off and the team eventually finished in the last automatic promotion place, ahead of Bury by virtue of a superior goal difference of just one.
