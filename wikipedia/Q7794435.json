He graduated from Queens' College, Cambridge in 1802 with the rank of seventh Wrangler. From 1803, Thompson served as a midshipman in the Royal Navy, switching to the British Army (as a lieutenant) in 1806. Thompson became Governor of Sierra Leone between August 1808 and June 1810, due in part to his acquaintance with William Wilberforce. He was recalled from the job after complaining about the system by which \"freed\" slaves were compulsorily \"apprenticed\" for fourteen years. He wrote that Wilberforce and the Sierra Leone Company had \"by means of their agents become slave traders themselves\". He threatened to expose this situation, so he was sacked, with Wilberforce himself agreeing to the dismissal.William Wilberforce 'condoned slavery', Colonial Office papers reveal.
