She married the widowed Gustaf Adolf in 1923 and assumed the role of Sweden's first lady but did not become queen until his accession in 1950.

Crown Princess Margaret founded a school for Ingrid with a small circle of Swedish noble girls. Ingrid was also given some domestic instruction as part of her education. As a child, she practiced cooking in her model cottage on the palace grounds and even washed the dishes after meals. The ability for a girl to cook, sew, and manage a household was seen as important at the time for royalty. In 1920, when Ingrid was just ten years old, her mother died from sepsis while in the eighth month of her sixth pregnancy. After her mother's death, Ingrid spent several months of each year in the United Kingdom in the care of her grandfather. Observers suggested that Ingrid's strong self-discipline was shaped as an effect of her mother's death. Her father remarried Lady Louise Mountbatten three years later. Louise was a second cousin of Ingrid's. Only a stillborn daughter resulted from her father's second marriage. Ingrid felt betrayed by her father when he remarried, and she was unkind to Crown Princess Louise. Ingrid and her father would not reconcile until many years later.Roger Lundgren quoting close royal family members in Ingrid \u2013 prinsessa av Sverige, drottning av Danmark  pp. 17-20"]}, {"page": "Victoria of Baden", "response": ["| King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden || 11 November 1882 ||  || married 1) Princess Margaret of Connaught (1882\u20131920), had issue (four sons, one daughter), married 2) Louise Mountbatten (1889\u20131965), a stillborn daughter"]}]}}
