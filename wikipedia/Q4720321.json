He was a friend of Benjamin Constant and translated his work.\nHowever he was most famous for his best-selling works linking physiology and aesthetics: Physiognomy, founded on Physiology (1834), Beauty, illustrated chiefly by ananalysis and classification of Beauty in Women (1836), and Woman physiologically considered as to mind, morals, matrimonial slavery, infidelity and divorce (1839). A great deal of what he wrote in this line is now considered to belong to the pseudosciences of physiognomy and phrenology.", "link_mentions": {}}}
