He was a friend of Benjamin Constant and translated his work.\nHowever he was most famous for his best-selling works linking physiology and aesthetics: Physiognomy, founded on Physiology (1834), Beauty, illustrated chiefly by ananalysis and classification of Beauty in Women (1836), and Woman physiologically considered as to mind, morals, matrimonial slavery, infidelity and divorce (1839). A great deal of what he wrote in this line is now considered to belong to the pseudosciences of physiognomy and phrenology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Walker", "response": ["* Alexander Walker (cricketer) (1842-1903), Scottish cricketer", "* Alexander Walker (physiologist) (1779\u20131852), Scottish physiologist", "* Alexander Walker (1837\u20131889), British businessman", "* Alexander Walker II (1869\u20131950), British businessman", "* Alexander Walker (critic) (1930\u20132003), film critic", "* Alexander Walker (conductor) (born 1973), British conductor", "* Alexander Walker (MP) for Lichfield", "*Alexander Walker Scott (1800\u20131883), Australian entomologist", "*Alexander Walker Ogilvie (1829\u20131902), Canadian politician"]}, {"page": "1779 in Scotland", "response": ["* 20 December \u2013 Alexander Walker, physiologist (died 1852)"]}, {"page": "John Neal bibliography", "response": ["| Biographical sketches of George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, John C.
