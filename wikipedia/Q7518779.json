First Boniak and his Cumans \"appeared before  and while ravaging the environs, they burned the prince's palace at Berestovo\"Russian Primary Chronicle (year 6604), p. 182. around 24 May. On 20 July, \"Boniak, that godless, mangy thief and bandit, came suddenly to Kiev for the second time\"Russian Primary Chronicle (year 6604), p. 183. and plundered three monasteries, including the Cave Monastery. During the second campaign, the Cumans \"planted two standards before the monastery gates\", which may show that they were under the command of two chieftains, according to Kov\u00e1cs. Kov\u00e1cs writes that Boniak's action preceded the campaign that Sviatopolk II and Vladimir Monomach launched against Oleg I of Chernigov. According to Simon Franklin and Jonathan Shepard, Boniak invaded only after Sviatopolk and his army left Kiev for a campaign against Chernigov (Chernihiv in Ukraine). Kov\u00e1cs says that the joint campaign of Sviatopolk and Vladimir Monomach against Boniak's land over the river Ros' that Monomach mentioned in his Testament seems to have been a retaliatory action after Bonia's plundering raids in Kiev."]}, {"page": "Rus' Khaganate", "response": ["*Ilarion of Kiev. \"Sermon on Law and Grace\".
