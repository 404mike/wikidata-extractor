Britton was a member of the London Mathematical Society and was Secretary of Meetings and Membership with that organization from 1973-1976.\nBritton died in a climbing accident on the Isle of Skye.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burnside problem", "response": ["The breakthrough in solving the Burnside problem was achieved by Pyotr Novikov and Sergei Adian in 1968. Using a complicated combinatorial argument, they demonstrated that for every odd number n with n > 4381, there exist infinite, finitely generated groups of exponent n. Adian later improved the bound on the odd exponent to 665.John Britton proposed a nearly 300 page alternative proof to the Burnside problem in 1973; however, Adian ultimately pointed out a flaw in that proof. The latest improvement to the bound on odd exponent is 101 obtained by Adian himself in 2015. The case of even exponent turned out to be considerably more difficult. It was only in 1994 that Sergei Vasilievich Ivanov was able to prove an analogue of Novikov\u2013Adian theorem: for any m > 1 and an even n \u2265 248, n divisible by 29, the group B(m, n) is infinite; together with the Novikov\u2013Adian theorem, this implies infiniteness for all m > 1 and n \u2265 248. This was improved in 1996 by I. G. Lys\u00ebnok to m > 1 and n \u2265 8000. Novikov\u2013Adian, Ivanov and Lys\u00ebnok established considerably more precise results on the structure of the free Burnside groups. In the case of the odd exponent, all finite subgroups of the free Burnside groups were shown to be cyclic groups. In the even exponent case, each finite subgroup is contained in a product of two dihedral groups, and there exist non-cyclic finite subgroups. Moreover, the word and conjugacy problems were shown to be effectively solvable in B(m, n) both for the cases of odd and even exponents n."]}, {"page": "John Leslie Britton", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Britton (mathematician)"]}, {"page": "John Britton", "response": ["John Britton may refer to:", "*John Britton (antiquary) (1771\u20131857), English antiquary, topographer, author and editor", "*John Britton (baseball) (1919\u20131990), American baseball player", "*John Britton (doctor) (1925\u20131994), American physician and abortion provider, killed by Paul Jennings Hill", "*John Britton (martyr) (died 1598), English Roman Catholic martyr", "*John Britton (mathematician) (1927\u20131994), English mathematician, combinatorial group theorist", "*John Britton (swimmer), 1923\u20132004, British and Kenyan Paralympian"]}, {"page": "Britton (surname)", "response": ["* John Britton (antiquary) (1771\u20131857), English antiquarian", "* John Britton (doctor) (1925\u20131994), assassinated abortion provider", "* John Britton (martyr), English Catholic martyr, executed during the reign of Elizabeth I", "* John Britton (mathematician) (1927\u20131994), British mathematician"]}]}}
