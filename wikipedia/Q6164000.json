Bury's run to the final was remarkable in that they were drawn away from home in every round but won through with victories over Burnley, Notts County, cup holders Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest. The semi-final against Forest was played at Stoke and ended 1\u20131 after Bury missed a penalty. A replay was held at Bramall Lane in Sheffield and Bury began disastrously by conceding two goals in the first two minutes. Charlie Sagar pulled one back after 55 minutes and then Jasper McLuckie equalised with only five minutes to go. Extra time was played and Sagar scored the winner after 110 minutes of play. The final at the old Crystal Palace ground was played in a heatwave and Bury, captained by Jack Pray, dominated from the start. The goals in a one-sided match were scored by McLuckie (2), Willie Wood and Jack Plant. The players were on a win bonus of \u00a310 each in the final, ten times more than their usual \u00a31 per match bonus."]}, {"page": "1901 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Tottenham were drawn at home in the second round to the FA Cup holders Bury, who had outplayed Tottenham's Southern League rivals Southampton in the 1900 final, winning 4\u20130.

When the game ended, the FA Cup trophy was presented to Bury's captain Jack Pray by Lord James of Hereford. Winning the cup proved to be profitable for Bury as the club's debts of \u00a31,230 were converted into a credit balance of \u00a31,329. Bury won the cup again in 1903 but that was their last appearance in the match.
