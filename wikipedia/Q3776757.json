Edward Dwelly, a Scottish lexicographer, lists tarbh-boidhre as \"Monster, demon\" and \"God capable of changing himself into many forms\"; tarbh-aoidhre is given as a northern counties variation. The simpler component of tarbh as a single word is defined by Dwelly as \"bull.\" Transcribers of the tale have used several differing spellings of the second component, some even adopting  inconsistent variations throughout their own renditions. George Henderson for instance, a folklorist and Celtic scholar, used five alternatives: bo'eithre; boidhre; bo-oibhre; eithre; and fhaire. Spelling variations employed by other writers include aoidhre; baoighre; baoidhre; boidhre; eighre; and oire."]}, {"page": "List of lexicographers", "response": ["*Edward Dwelly (UK, 1864\u20131939) Scottish Gaelic dictionary"]}, {"page": "Loch Leven (Highlands)", "response": ["The village of Kinlochleven at the head of the loch was established when the aluminium smelter was built there during the first decade of the twentieth century.
