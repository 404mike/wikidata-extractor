It was presumed he named it after fellow naval officer James Everard Home. Stokes' maps do not record the name, but many secondary sources attribute its introduction to him. The first known map showing Cape Everard was made in 1852 and published in 1853, by surveyor George Douglas Smythe. If he coined the name, then, according to one theory, he may have been referring to William Everard, a South Australian Commissioner of Crown Lands.
