He turned professional in 1989 and after six years playing on the second tier Challenge Tour and several unsuccessful visits to the European Tour's qualifying school, he finally gained his European Tour card in 1995. He had a moderately successful rookie season, and maintained his playing privileges until 1999, when he had to go back to qualifying school.\nTunnicliff was unable to regain his tour card at qualifying school and after two more years playing on the Challenge Tour and in minor European Tour events, made his breakthrough with victory in the 2002 Great North Open just two weeks after the death of his mother from cancer. That win secured his place on the European Tour. Two years later he won his second tournament, the Diageo Championship at Gleneagles, and that season went on to record his best year-end ranking on the European Tour Order of Merit, 34th place. He also won the Mauritius Open in both 2004 and 2005. After losing his European Tour card in 2010 he played on the Asian Tour. After an injury in 2014, Tunnicliff started playing on the MENA Golf Tour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Plymouth College", "response": ["*Miles Tunnicliff (born 1968), golfer"]}, {"page": "Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles", "response": ["| 2004 ||  Miles Tunnicliff || align=center|275 || align=center|\u221213 || 5 strokes ||  Graeme McDowell"]}, {"page": "Niclas Fasth", "response": ["| Miles Tunnicliff", "| Miles Tunnicliff"]}, {"page": "New Zealand Open", "response": ["| ANZ, EUR|| Niclas Fasth|| align=\"center\" |266 || align=center|\u221222 || Playoff ||  Miles Tunnicliff|| Gulf Harbour"]}, {"page": "Malaysian Open (golf)", "response": ["| align=center|2009 || ASA, EUR ||  Anthony Kang || align=\"center\" |271 || align=\"center\" |\u221217 || 1 stroke ||  David Horsey Prayad Marksaeng Jyoti Randhawa Miles Tunnicliff || Saujana ||"]}, {"page": "Great North Open", "response": ["| 2002 ||  Miles Tunnicliff || align=center|279 || align=center|\u22129 || 4 strokes ||  Sven Str\u00fcver"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Miles Tunnicliff||1968\u2013"]}, {"page": "2004 Open Championship", "response": [":Europe \u2013 Paul Broadhurst, Christian C\u00e9va\u00ebr, Nicolas Colsaerts, Gary Emerson, Klas Eriksson, Kenneth Ferrie, Mark Foster, Peter Hedblom, Maarten Lafeber, Euan Little, Paul McGinley, Colin Montgomerie, M\u00e5rten Olander, Eduardo Romero, Miles Tunnicliff, Simon Wakefield"]}, {"page": "Tunnicliffe", "response": ["*Miles Tunnicliff (b. 1968), British golfer"]}, {"page": "Anthony Kang", "response": ["| David Horsey,  Prayad Marksaeng, Jyoti Randhawa,  Miles Tunnicliff", "| David Horsey,  Prayad Marksaeng, Jyoti Randhawa,  Miles Tunnicliff"]}, {"page": "Mauritius Open", "response": ["|2005 || Miles Tunnicliff (2)||  || 207", "|2004 || Miles Tunnicliff ||  || 205"]}, {"page": "2004 European Tour", "response": ["|10\u201313 Jun||Diageo Championship at Gleneagles||Scotland|| Miles Tunnicliff (2)||align=center|24 ||"]}, {"page": "2002 European Tour", "response": ["|20\u201323 Jun || Great North Open || England ||  Miles Tunnicliff (1) ||align=center|24 || "]}, {"page": "Zane Scotland", "response": ["| Craig Hinton,  Miles Tunnicliff"]}, {"page": "2008 BMW PGA Championship", "response": ["|Miles Tunnicliff||||align=center|70-65=135", "|Miles Tunnicliff||||align=center|70-65-77=212"]}]}}
