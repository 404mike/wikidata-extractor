He was educated at Sedbergh School, Yorkshire, and at King's College, Cambridge, where he read zoology. He served at Gallipoli in World War I.\nIn 1919, he accepted the chair of zoology at the University of Melbourne; his notable projects concerned marsupial chromosomes and inheritance in cattle. He successfully challenged the Lamarckian findings of William McDougall relating to the inheritance of the effects of training in rats.\nIn 1938 Agar was elected president of the Eugenics Society of Victoria. He said \"it was a disastrous state of affairs that size of families was usually in inverse ratio to intelligence.\"Agar was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1944 and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society.Agar Street in the Canberra suburb of Bruce was dedicated in his name.Agar was the author of the book A Contribution to the Theory of the Living Organism (1943). The book was based on the system of Whitehead's philosophy of the organism and argued for a form panpsychism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Wilfred Eade Agar (King's), animal scientist"]}, {"page": "Sedbergh School", "response": ["*Wilfred Eade Agar, Anglo-Australian zoologist\u2018AGAR, Wilfred Eade\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920\u20132007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 accessed 29 Nov 2008"]}, {"page": "Bruce, Australian Capital Territory", "response": ["* Agar Street \u2013 Wilfred Eade Agar, professor of zoology"]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Victoria", "response": ["* 1927-1928: Wilfred Eade Agar"]}, {"page": "Clarke Medal", "response": ["* 1944: Wilfred Eade Agar (Zoology)"]}, {"page": "Wilfred Agar", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wilfred Eade Agar"]}, {"page": "W.
