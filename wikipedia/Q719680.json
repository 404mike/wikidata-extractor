His photos concentrate on the interaction between ephemeral atmospheric condition of the natural landscape, and human-made structures and sculptural mass.\nMany books have been published of his work, the subjects of which range from The Rouge, in Dearborn Michigan, to the snow-covered island of Hokkaido, Japan. Kenna's work is also held in permanent collections at the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris, The National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Kenna (politician)", "response": ["Michael Kenna (August 20, 1857 \u2013 October 9, 1946), also known as \"Hinky Dink\", was an American politician who served as alderman of Chicago's 1st Ward from 1897 to 1923 and again from 1939 to 1943. In addition to his position as alderman he was committeeman of the 1st Ward for the Democratic Party from 1893 to 1944. Representing the Chicago Loop and later its environs in such capacities, he led what was often called the \"world's richest ward\". He and his partner, fellow 1st Ward alderman \"Bathhouse John\" Coughlin, controlled the ward for most of the first half of the 20th century.", "Michael Kenna was born in the late 1850s to Catherine ( Ferrel) and John Kenna, both immigrants from County Cork. He was born at the corner of Polk and Sholto (modern-day Carpenter) streets at the edge of \"Connelly's Patch\" on Chicago's Near West Side. At age 10 he left school and began selling newspapers. At age 12, by then an orphan, he borrowed $50 from a barkeeper and purchased a newsstand at the corner of Monroe and Dearborn Streets. He was so successful that he was able to pay back the loan within a month, and would sell newspapers at the stand until 1877. According to legend, it was at this time that Kenna got the nickname \"Hinky Dink\" from Chicago Tribune publisher Joseph Medill due to his small stature; as an adult he stood  tall. Kenna variously professed ignorance of the nickname's origin or claimed that it arose at \"th' old swimming hole.\" He was also known as \"the little fellow\". In 1879 he moved to Leadville, Colorado, to work for a newspaper in the area, returning to Chicago in 1881."]}, {"page": "List of photographers", "response": ["* Michael Kenna (born 1953)"]}, {"page": "1953 in art", "response": ["** Michael Kenna, English landscape photographer"]}, {"page": "Night photography", "response": ["By the 1990s, British-born photographer Michael Kenna had established himself as the most commercially successful night photographer.

In that rendition, he faced a somewhat different technical problem by the need to further compress the subject tonal range into the three highest tonal values the paper could take. In order for it to work, he had to visualize the final print, then properly expose his negative to enable him to print it in the limited high-key tonal range; that is, he had to plan the complete end-to-end process in some detail.  In those situations Adams' Zone System is most effective.  Having learned at the feet of the master, McSavaney utilized Adams' principles of image management and value management to control the complete process. In Adams' explanation, such control allows a photographer to \"visualize the different possible renderings of a subject at the film plane, and manage the image in such a way as to achieve the desired photographic interpretation.\"Adams, Ansel, (1980)\" - Ch 7\"Ansel Adams, (1983)\" - p176 Easy as pie!. Applying Adams\u2019 instructional approach in critiquing students\u2019 work,Adams, 1980 - Ch 5 McSavaney's workshops attracted generations of large-format photographers. His non-judgmental evaluations of their photographs were authentic learning experiences. At times, he invited other well-known photographers as workshop instructors \u2013 for examples Paul Caponigro, Michael Kenna and his former OVPW colleague John Sexton. Occasionally he invited talented writers and artists as joint instructors in his workshop program. A frequent participant was writer John Nichols, another the Santa Fe artist Carol Rose Brown, each a highly acclaimed practitioner of Southwestern themes.  He well knew that their differing insights and viewpoints would enrich his students\u2019 experiences.  Some of his students had successful photography careers; among them the Los Angeles medical doctor  Bernard Lewinsky and a sometime companion in the Southwest, Ken Karagozian (see below)."]}, {"page": "John Wood (poet)", "response": ["Wood authored of over a dozen volumes of photographic history and criticism, including America and the Daguerreotype, which was selected as a 1992 \"Outstanding Academic Book of the Year\" by the American Library Association, and Secrets of the Dark Chamber, which the New York Times named a Best Book of the Year in 1995. In 1988, Wood co-founded the Dageurreian Society and was its first president. He contributed many articles to the Dageurreian Annual and co-curated the Smithsonian Institution's landmark 1995 exhibition Secrets of the Dark Chamber. He also contributed to the National Museum of American Art's exhibition Silver and Gold: Photographs of the Gold Rush. His early research and criticism focused on the Daguerreotype and cyanotype but came to include other photographic processes, including the  Autochrome Lumi\u00e8re, and increasingly focused on contemporary photographers like Sally Mann and Joel-Peter Witkin. He wrote the forwards of more than thirty photography monographs, including work by the artists Jan Saudek, Keith Carter and Connie Imboden and edited more than forty-five monographs of leading photographers such as Masao Yamamoto, Jerry Uelsmann and Michael Kenna.
