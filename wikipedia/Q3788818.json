His films, A Daring Daylight Burglary and The Robbery of the Mail Coach (featuring a protagonist based on Jack Sheppard, the infamous 18th-century English highwayman), made in April and September 1903, are regarded as highly influential on the development of Edwin Porter\u2019s paradigmatic \"chase film\" The Great Train Robbery of December 1903, and often claimed as the prototype of the action film. The uniqueness of Mottershaw's A Daring Daylight Burglary is seen in the way it tracks a single action through changing locations. Henry Jasper Redfern and Mottershaw made the first motion pictures filmed outdoors in Sheffield.\nIn 1900 Mottershaw formed the Sheffield Photo Company, which by 1905 was one of the leading film companies in the country.Mottershaw also made documentary films, an early example being The Coronation of King Peter I of Serbia in Belgrade, made in 1904, with Arnold Muir Wilson.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of film", "response": ["Films of this genre were later termed \"chase films\". These were inspired by James Williamson's Stop Thief! of 1901, which showed a tramp stealing a leg of mutton from a butcher's boy in the first shot, then being chased through the second shot by the butcher's boy and assorted dogs, and finally being caught by the dogs in the third shot. Several British films made in the first half of 1903 extended the chase method of film construction. These included An Elopement \u00e0 la Mode and The Pickpocket: A Chase Through London, made by Alf Collins for the British branch of the French Gaumont company, A Daring Daylight Burglary, made by Frank Mottershaw at the Sheffield Photographic Company, and Desperate Poaching Affray, made by William Haggar. Haggar in particular innovated the first extant panning shots; the poachers are chased by gamekeepers and police officers and the camera pans along, creating a sense of urgency and speed. His films were also recognised for their intelligent use of depth of staging and screen edges, while film academic No\u00ebl Burch praised Haggar's effective use of off-screen space.Hayes, Christian. Phantom Rides, BFI Screen Online. Accessed 30 August 2011. He was also one of the first filmmakers to purposefully introduce violence for entertainment; in Desperate Poaching Affray, the villains are seen firing guns at their pursuers."]}, {"page": "Cinema of the United Kingdom", "response": ["In 1903 Frank Mottershaw of Sheffield produced the film A Daring Daylight Robbery, which launched the chase genre."]}, {"page": "Nickelodeon (movie theater)", "response": ["* Johnny's Run (directed by Frank Mottershaw; comedy)", "* The Romany's Revenge (directed by Frank Mottershaw; drama)"]}, {"page": "1903 in film", "response": ["* A Daring Daylight Burglary, by Frank Mottershaw"]}, {"page": "Charles Peace", "response": ["*The Life of Charles Peace  (Nov 1905, UK, b & w, silent) by Frank Mottershaw"]}, {"page": "Peter I of Serbia", "response": ["New royal  regalia, consisting of a crown, sceptre, orb and royal mantle, were commissioned specially for the occasion from the Parisian jewelers Falize Fr\u00e8res.

Three minutes long, the film is recognised as an early influence on narrative drama in American film, especially in the chase genre. The film used a number of innovative techniques including on-location shooting, panning shots, and unconventional use of screen edges. The film, along with Frank Mottershaw's film A Daring Daylight Burglary, is considered to have helped launch the chase subgenre and influenced Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery.", "Desperate Poaching Affray is in turn influenced by Frank Mottershaw's film A Daring Daylight Burglary, also 1903. In Haggar's film similar to Mottershaw's there is a cutting of action, as a character runs towards the camera to leave via the screen edge. The pursuers are nowhere to be seen in one shot, before entering dramatically onto the screen from the front.Berry (1996) p. 51 In another cut the villains exit the scene to the left, then emerge after a cut in the foreground, in a shot that suggests the chase has been continuing for longer than the screen time. Haggar continues to use different angles in the film and introduces his first panning shot, showing Haggar had a rudimentary understanding of early film grammar and conventions. Despite Haggar's theatrical background, and apart from one wild over-acted haymaker swing from William Haggar Jr. as he floors an opponent, the film refuses to follow theatricality or staging."]}, {"page": "Kinver Light Railway", "response": ["The Sheffield Photo Company produced a film in 1904 entitled A Ride on the Kinver Light Railway.John Huntley, Railways ikn the Cinema, Allan 1969, p.151 It was directed by Frank Mottershaw, a pioneer film maker."]}, {"page": "A Daring Daylight Burglary", "response": ["A Daring Daylight Burglary (also known asA Daring Daylight Robbery) is a 1903 British short silent film directed by Frank Mottershaw.
