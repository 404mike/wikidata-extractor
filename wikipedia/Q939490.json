They overtook derby rivals Everton to win the league by two points and later came from behind to defeat Everton 3\u20131 in the 1986 FA Cup final at Wembley. After 1986, Lawrenson's first team place came under threat from the younger Gary Gillespie. Lawrenson's partnership with team captain Hansen continued for one more season before he, already out through a minor injury, suffered Achilles tendon damage in 1988 which prematurely ended his career. He earned a fifth and final title medal when that season ended. His Liverpool career ended after 332 appearances and 18 goals in all competitions \u2013 one of which was the fifth goal in a 5\u20130 defeat of Merseyside rivals Everton on 6 November 1982, a game in which Ian Rush scored four of the five goals."]}, {"page": "Joe Fagan", "response": ["In the 1983\u201384 season, Fagan's first as Liverpool manager, the team won the European Cup, the League Championship and the League Cup and so Fagan was the first manager of an English club to win a treble, three major trophies in a single season. He had quickly expanded his squad with the signings of Michael Robinson and Gary Gillespie. His first game in charge ended in defeat, at the hands of Manchester United in the FA Charity Shield, but the first silverware was received following victory over Everton in the League Cup Final replay at Maine Road. The Championship was secured with a game to spare and then Liverpool won a penalty shoot-out against A.S. Roma in Rome to clinch the club's fourth European Cup. Fagan won the Manager of the Year award."]}, {"page": "Nigel Spackman", "response": ["Liverpool lost just twice in the league all season, claiming the title with ease and Spackman was in the side which beat Nottingham Forest 5\u20130. Spackman's stamina and unselfishness set up the last goal for Aldridge. Whelan was fit again with a month of the season left, but wasn't selected. Spackman was selected for the rest of the campaign, including the FA Cup Final, which Liverpool surprisingly lost to Wimbledon. Spackman and teammate Gary Gillespie both played that game with bandages around their heads after the two had suffered cuts in a clash during a game against Derby County the previous week."]}, {"page": "Gary Ablett (English footballer)", "response": ["Ablett joined hometown club Liverpool as an apprentice upon leaving St Margaret's Church of England High School in 1982. He made his Liverpool debut on 20 December 1986 in a goalless league away draw with Charlton Athletic, when regular defenders Barry Venison and Mark Lawrenson were absent due to injury. He made five more appearances that season, scoring what would be his only goal for the club on 18 April 1987 in a 3\u20130 home league victory over Nottingham Forest. Alongside experienced players in defence, such as Gary Gillespie, Steve Nicol and skipper Alan Hansen, Ablett helped Liverpool win the League championship and reach the 1988 FA Cup Final. Ablett only collected a runners-up medal in the latter competition due to Liverpool's shock 1\u20130 defeat by Wimbledon."]}, {"page": "Charlie Nicholas", "response": ["With the lack of a striker of the ilk of Frank McGarvey to play alongside at Arsenal, Nicholas barely broke double figures in the following seasons, not helped that he was also often played just off the main striker. Whilst Nicholas could display extravagant skills, a lack of consistency restricted his impact. The arrival of George Graham as the new manager of Arsenal in the summer of 1986 saw Nicholas no longer have an automatic place in the team. Arsenal, however, did reach the League Cup final against Liverpool in April 1987. Liverpool's Ian Rush gave his side the lead on 23 minutes, but Nicholas equalised seven minutes later after a goal mouth scramble. In the second half, he appeared to be fouled in the penalty box by Gary Gillespie, but the referee ignored Arsenal's claims for a penalty. With seven minutes left, Nicholas received a cross from Perry Groves and shot at goal. The ball took a deflection off Ronnie Whelan, and went into the goal having deceived Bruce Grobbelaar. Arsenal held on to win 2\u20131. With this Wembley brace Nicholas thus became a club hero."]}, {"page": "1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)", "response": ["* Gary Gillespie (playing against Yugoslavia)"]}, {"page": "History of Celtic F.C.

Striker Tony Cascarino was signed for a club record \u00a31.1 million from Aston Villa in the summer of 1991.  Cascarino was not a success at Celtic and was moved on to Chelsea in a swap deal for Scotland defender Tom Boyd in February 1992.  In an attempt to bolster Celtic's defence, Liverpool defender Gary Gillespie was signed in August 1991 for \u00a3925,000.  However, Gillespie struggled to adapt to the more robust style of play in Scotland, so Brady signed Middlesbrough's Tony Mowbray a few months later in a \u00a31 million deal to add steel to a light-weight central defence.  Unfortunately both Gillespie and Mowbray's spells at Celtic were blighted by injuries and the pair did not often play together."]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 in English football", "response": ["1 May 1990 \u2013 Kenny Dalglish makes his final appearance for Liverpool at the age of 39, in their 1\u20130 home league win over Derby County.
