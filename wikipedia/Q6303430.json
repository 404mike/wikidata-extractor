A graduate of King's College, London and Somerville College, Oxford, she held a research fellowship and then a lectureship at the University of St Andrews before transferring to a lectureship at Queen's University, Belfast. There she became a Reader and, eventually, Professor. In 2005, she took the professorship at Edinburgh, retiring in 2011.\nSpecialising in Anglo-Norman England, her notable works include:\n\nThe Government of England Under Henry I, (Cambridge, 1986)\nThe Aristocracy of Norman England, (Cambridge, 1997)\nHenry I, King of England and Duke of Normandy, (Cambridge, 2006)\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry I of England", "response": ["Henry was the youngest of William and Matilda's four sons. Physically he resembled his older brothers Robert Curthose, Richard and William Rufus, being, as historian David Carpenter describes, \"short, stocky and barrel-chested,\" with black hair. As a result of their age differences and Richard's early death, Henry would have probably seen relatively little of his older brothers. He probably knew his sister Adela well, as the two were close in age. There is little documentary evidence for his early years; historians Warren Hollister and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England, while Judith Green argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy.; ; . He was probably educated by the Church, possibly by Bishop Osmund, the King's chancellor, at Salisbury Cathedral; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to become a member of the clergy.;  It is also uncertain how far Henry's education extended, but he was probably able to read Latin and had some background in the liberal arts. He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086.; ", "Henry's next steps are not well documented; one chronicler, Orderic Vitalis, suggests that he travelled in the French Vexin, along the Normandy border, for over a year with a small band of followers. By the end of the year, Robert and William Rufus had fallen out once again, and the Treaty of Rouen had been abandoned. In 1092, Henry and his followers seized the Normandy town of Domfront. Domfront had previously been controlled by Robert of Bell\u00eame, but the inhabitants disliked his rule and invited Henry to take over the town, which he did in a bloodless coup. Over the next two years, Henry re-established his network of supporters across western Normandy, forming what Judith Green terms a \"court in waiting\".;  By 1094, he was allocating lands and castles to his followers as if he were the Duke of Normandy. William Rufus began to support Henry with money, encouraging his campaign against Robert, and Henry used some of this to construct a substantial castle at Domfront.", "Late medieval historians seized on the accounts of selected chroniclers regarding Henry's education and gave him the title of Henry \"Beauclerc\", a theme echoed in the analysis of Victorian and Edwardian historians such as Francis Palgrave and Henry Davis. The historian Charles David dismissed this argument in 1929, showing the more extreme claims for Henry's education to be without foundation.;  Modern histories of Henry commenced with Richard Southern's work in the early 1960s, followed by extensive research during the rest of the 20th century into a wide number of themes from his reign in England, and a much more limited number of studies of his rule in Normandy. Only two major, modern biographies of Henry have been produced, C. Warren Hollister's posthumous volume in 2001, and Judith Green's 2006 work.; "]}, {"page": "David I of Scotland", "response": ["David's brother King Edgar had visited William Rufus in May 1099 and bequeathed to David extensive territory to the south of the river Forth.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 59\u201360.

It has been assumed that David took control of his inheritance \u2013 the southern lands bequeathed by Edgar \u2013 soon after the latter's death.Judith Green, \"David I and Henry I\", p. 3. She cites the gap in knowledge about David's whereabouts as evidence; for a brief outline of David's itinerary, see Barrow, The Charters of David I, pp. 38\u201341 However, it cannot be shown that he possessed his inheritance until his foundation of Selkirk Abbey late in 1113.See Oram, David, pp. 60\u20132; Duncan, The Kingship of the Scots, pp. 60\u20134. According to Richard Oram, it was only in 1113, when Henry returned to England from Normandy, that David was at last in a position to claim his inheritance in southern Scotland.For all this, see Oram, David, pp. 59\u201363."]}, {"page": "William de Corbeil", "response": ["The construction of the keep of Rochester Castle\u2014at , the tallest Norman-built keep in England\u2014was initiated at William's orders.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 277 Built for King Henry, it is still intact, although it no longer has a roof or floors. The work at Rochester was built within the stone curtain walls that Gundulf of Rochester had erected in the late 11th\u00a0century. The keep was designed for defence and also to provide comfortable living quarters, which were probably intended for use by the archbishops when they visited Rochester.Platt Castle in Medieval England & Wales pp. 23\u201324 In 1127, the custody of Rochester Castle was granted to William and his successors as archbishop by King Henry, including the right to fortify the place as the archbishops wished, and the right to garrison the castle with their own men.DuBoulay Lordship of Canterbury p. 80 In the view of the historian Judith Green, the grant of the castle was partly to secure the loyalty of the archbishop to the king, and partly to help secure the defences of the Kent coast.Green Henry I p. 270 William also completed the construction of Canterbury Cathedral, which was dedicated in May 1130."]}, {"page": "Pipe rolls", "response": ["The lone surviving Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, has been a popular subject of study.

The royal document commanded the sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates other than those normal for such courts. From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining those who did not attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of procedure that could be used in what type of case.Green Henry I pp. 115\u2013116"]}, {"page": "Walter de Beauchamp (nobleman)", "response": ["Beauchamp probably held the office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence for this is that after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire at the same rate as his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held the office of forester.Green Government of England p. 184 and footnote 108 The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office.Hollister Henry I p. 361 He also upheld the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler.Green Government of England p. 208 He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown.Mason \"Introduction\" Beauchamp Cartulary p. lii While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England."]}]}}
