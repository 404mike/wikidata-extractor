The team recovered to beat Sheffield United 2\u20130 in their following match with goals from Clennell and Ken MacDonald but suffered a further blow after losing 1\u20130 to struggling Bradford who were 21st in the table. Two matches against reigning First Division champions Burnley produced positive results as the teams drew 1\u20131 at Turf Moor before Cardiff won the reverse fixture 4\u20132 at Ninian Park. Len Davies scored a brace with Gill and Jack Evans scoring one each. Cardiff repeated the pattern in their following two matches against Newcastle United, drawing away before Len Davies scored the only goal in a home victory. Despite taking the lead early in the match, Cardiff suffered a 5\u20131 defeat to league leaders Liverpool on 15 April. Two days later, they lost heavily again in a 3\u20131 defeat to Blackburn. They met Liverpool in the reverse fixture on 22 April, their opponents already having secured the First Division title. Cardiff went on to win the match 2\u20130.

Arsenal took the lead in the first half through Tom Whittaker before Grimshaw equalised. In the second half, a brace from Len Davies and one from Harry Nash secured victory for Cardiff. Cardiff was considered a heavy favourite to repeat its win in the reverse fixture on 16 September. However, Arsenal dominated the fixture and won the match 2\u20131 as Cardiff suffered injuries to Jack Page, already deputising for the injured Jimmy Blair, and Gill. The defeat saw Cardiff fall to seventh in the table and was the start of a poor run of form that would damage the club's season. Back-to-back defeats against Everton followed at the end of September and this pattern was repeated in successive fixtures against Sunderland in October. A 3\u20131 away defeat against reigning league holders and league leaders Liverpool meant Cardiff had suffered six consecutive defeats and left the club in 21st position with only Stoke remaining below them. In the reverse fixture against Liverpool on 26 October, the team won their first fixture since early September to end their losing run, winning 3\u20130 following goals from Grimshaw, Ken MacDonald and Clennell. The victory lifted Cardiff out of the relegation zone at the expense of Preston North End. A goalless draw against Birmingham was followed by a 1\u20131 draw against the same opponents on 11 November, despite Cardiff playing with what The Times described as \"a great pace, which would have beaten many teams\".", "! scope=row|Ken MacDonald"]}]}}
