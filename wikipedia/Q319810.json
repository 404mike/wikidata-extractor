He then went out on loan to Hull City, Crewe Alexandra and Barnsley before joining Hull permanently. He then went on to play for Wrexham and Chester City before finally finding regular football at Championship side Ipswich Town. Walters spent three years at Portman Road before joining Stoke City for \u00a32.75 million in August 2010. He helped Stoke reach the 2011 FA Cup Final after scoring twice in the semi-final against Bolton Wanderers as Stoke won 5\u20130. Walters played 54 matches during the 2011\u201312 season and then played in UEFA Euro 2012 with the Republic of Ireland. Walters remained a regular at Stoke under Tony Pulis and Mark Hughes, scoring 62 goals in 271 appearances before joining Burnley in July 2017.\nWalters scored five times for the Republic of Ireland in 2015 during their successful UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, and was acknowledged with that year's FAI Senior International Player of the Year award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Professional Footballers' Association", "response": ["*Jonathan Walters (Burnley, Premier League)"]}, {"page": "Republic of Ireland national football team", "response": ["The draw for the Euro 2016 Play-off was held in Nyon, Switzerland, on 18 October 2015. Ireland were unseeded in the draw, meaning they could face one of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Sweden or Hungary. Ireland were drawn against Bosnia and Herzegovina, the top seeded team in the play-off. The only previous meeting between the teams resulted in a 1\u20130 win for the Republic of Ireland in a friendly in 2012, Shane Long scoring the game's only goal. Owing to injuries and suspensions, Ireland had only the \"B\" squad available for the first leg of the play-off, played in Bilino Polje Stadium. A goal from Robbie Brady almost secured a victory for the Irish until Edin D\u017eeko equalised 1\u20131 to end off the match. In the second leg played at the Aviva Stadium, Jonathan Walters scored two goals leading to a 2\u20130 victory for the Irish.

He also became Stoke City's leading Premier League goalscorer of all time during the same season, reaching 45 goals and overtaking the 43 scored by Jonathan Walters. Crouch signed another one-year contract extension with the Potters in November 2017.

He signed goalkeeper Michael Ingham, defenders David Bayliss and Lee Roche, and strikers Lee McEvilly and Jonathan Walters, whilst blooding brothers Marc and Mike Williams. However, Wrexham struggled in the league, despite on loan striker Matt Derbyshire scoring 10 goals in 16 appearances. They finished the season 13th in League Two, having won only one of their last nine matches.

He ended this run with a goal against Everton on New Year's Day. However, he again went on a goal drought this time for three months before scoring against Tottenham Hotspur in April. He then went on a similar scoring run he had at the start of the season scoring against Bolton Wanderers at Wembley, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers and then had an opportunity to become the first Stoke player to score in four consecutive Premier League matches against Blackpool but he missed an open goal. He made amends the following match scoring against Arsenal in a 3\u20131 win. Jones played in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Stoke lost 1\u20130 to Manchester City, he had Stoke's best chance in the match going through one on one with Joe Hart who saved Jones' effort.

In a rare appearance, against Newcastle United on 28 November 2012 coming on as a substitute, he provided an assist for Jonathan Walters and then scored the winning goal. On 29 December, Jerome \"lashed into the top corner from 30 yards\" to score Stoke's third goal in a 3\u20133 draw with Southampton in the final minute of the match. He scored his third and final goal of the season in a 2\u20131 win against Reading on 9 February 2013. Stoke ended the season in 13th position with Jerome making 30 appearances of which nine were starts. At the end of the season Tony Pulis was replaced by Mark Hughes and Jerome criticised Pulis' lack of squad rotation.\u00a0\u2013 \"There's no guarantees [for places under Hughes] but before in the old regime, there was a guaranteed XI who played.

He began the 2008\u201309 campaign with his first team prospects seemingly irretrievable but Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock named (and used) him as a substitute for the away draw at Ipswich Town and home victory over Charlton in September and on 4 October he scored the second goal of Palace's 2\u20130 victory at Nottingham Forest. Kuqi's return to the first team completed a remarkable sequence of events, and he ended his season as the top scorer of his team. Kuqi was offered a new contract on 27 January 2009 which he rejected. By the end of the season, Kuqi was offered a new contract again along with 5 other players but a few months later, Warnock said he was expecting Kuqi to leave."]}]}}
