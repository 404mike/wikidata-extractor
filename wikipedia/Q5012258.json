J. Wildheart is an English musician of Guyanese and Seychellois descent. He is a solo artist and also a founding member of the UK rock band The Wildhearts.He was born in Colchester, and his early childhood was spent living in various military bases in Malaysia and Europe whilst his father and mother served in the British army. The family eventually moved back to the UK during his teens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Wildhearts", "response": ["After many early personnel changes, the line-up solidified around Ginger on guitar and vocals, CJ (Christopher Jagdhar) on guitar and vocals, Danny McCormack on bass and vocals, and Dogs D'Amour drummer Bam. This line-up released two EPs in 1992, Mondo Akimbo a-Go-Go and Don\u2019t Be Happy\u2026Just Worry.", "In 1992, drummer Bam returned to Dogs D'Amour and was replaced by Stidi (Andrew Stidolph). To follow up their first two EPs, the Wildhearts recorded demos for their first full-length album, which were released as Earth vs the Wildhearts without re-recording. The singles \"Greetings From Shitsville\" and \"TV Tan\" were underground hits in 1993. Stidi left the band shortly afterwards to be replaced by Ritch Battersby, just in time for the recording of the single \"Caffeine Bomb\", a UK chart hit at the beginning of 1994, helped by a memorable video in which Ginger appeared to vomit into CJ's face. The band appeared on Top of the Pops with Ginger wearing green welding goggles. The debut album was reissued in late 1994 with \"Caffeine Bomb\" tacked on as an extra track.", "The second album proper was to be known as P.H.U.Q.. Midway through the recording sessions, Ginger fired guitarist CJ, and some of the album's tracks were recorded without a second guitarist. P.H.U.Q. was released in May 1995 and reached number 6 in the UK Albums Chart, making it the band's most successful album. Shortly after the album's release, Mark Keds of Senseless Things was drafted as second guitarist, but lasted just one recording session, in which he appeared on the B-sides for the single \"Just in Lust\". Within a few weeks Keds was sacked after disappearing to Japan for a farewell tour with his old band. The Wildhearts were again down to a three-piece (Ginger, McCormack, and Battersby) for a few months, and performed a few gigs in this incarnation. The band resolved to return to a two-guitar formation, and after requesting demos and holding auditions, hired the previously unknown Jef Streatfield.", "In early 2001 Ginger announced that he was reforming the Earth vs the Wildhearts lineup of the band for a tour later that year. This lineup (consisting of Ginger and CJ on guitars and vocals, Danny McCormack on bass and vocals, and Stidi on drums) soon ran into difficulty due to McCormack's battle against heroin addiction, and on several dates of the comeback tour Toshi (from support band AntiProduct) stood in as bassist. By 2002 McCormack was once again clean and the band started recording a new mini-album and also toured the UK. The tracks intended for the album were released in the UK in late 2002 across three formats of the \"Vanilla Radio\" single, and as the mini-album Riff After Riff After Motherfucking Riff in Japan. \"Vanilla Radio\" reached the top 30 in the UK singles chart, and in early 2003 work began on a full-length album. However, during recording, McCormack checked himself into a rehabilitation center to deal with an alcohol problem, leaving Ginger to play the bass parts on the songs that were newly recorded for the album. McCormack's place in the live band was filled by \"Random\" Jon Poole, who had already worked with Ginger on his Silver Ginger 5 side project.", "In August 2018 the band announced it would be touring to celebrate 25 years of the Earth vs the Wildhearts album, in which the album would be played in full at each shows. The lineup for this tour included Ginger, CJ, Danny McCormack, and Ritch Battersby. In early January 2019 the band announced the recording of a new album had been completed with mixing to follow. The album Renaissance Men was released on 3 May 2019. The album 21st Century Love Songs was released on 3 September 2021.", "*CJ - guitar, vocals (1989\u20131994, 2001\u20132004, 2005, 2006\u20132009, 2012\u2013present)", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - Guitar", "* CJ - Guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar", "* CJ - guitar"]}, {"page": "P.H.U.Q.", "response": ["Original guitarist/singer CJ was only present for some of the early recording sessions for this album and was later fired by group leader Ginger.
