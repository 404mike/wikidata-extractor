In good weather conditions, the first piece saw Nereus take an early lead, the Dutch crew holding a length's lead by Fulham Wall. CUWBC's cox steered a wide course into slower water allowing Nereus to extend their lead to three lengths by the Mile Post. Although CUWBC reduced the deficit by a length on the approach to the Harrods Furniture Depository, the race concluded at Chiswick Steps with Nereus two lengths ahead. The second race, from Chiswick Eyot to the finishing post, started well for Cambridge, who held a slender lead until Barnes Bridge whereupon Nereus drew level, and following a push, crossed the finishing line a quarter of a length ahead. Two days later, OUWBC raced in a three-piece set of five-minute races along the Championship Course against Imperial College, umpired by Richard Phelps. Starting from Putney Bridge, the first race saw Oxford take an early lead which they extended with ease to pass the winning line at Harrods by four lengths. Imperial started the second race, commencing from St Paul's School, with a length's head start. Oxford were level within two minutes and despite being warned for steering infringements, went on to win the race by three lengths. The third piece started with a half-length head start to Imperial, and once again, although Oxford were warned for aggressive steering, they closed the gap quickly and had clear water advantage with two minutes of the race remaining. They won the race by three and a half lengths."]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 1993 Summer Universiade", "response": ["| ClarryRogersWildCracknellBehrensRichard PhelpsCassidyMatthew ParishMartin Haycock"]}]}}
