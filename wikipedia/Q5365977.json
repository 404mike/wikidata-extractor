He was a left winger who was quite tall and scored his fair share of headed goals. His career lasted from 1924 until 1939 during which time  he played 447 league games, scoring 142 goals, he also played for the England national football team on four occasions. He was also a talented musician and often played piano at public appearances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eric Brook", "response": ["Brook's 'workmanlike' p29 club form earned him a call up to the England team in 1929 and he made his first appearance for his nation against Ireland. His debut performance for England was described as 'decidedly promising'. Brook went on to play for England a total of 18 times, scoring 10 goals. He may have played more times for his country, but faced competition, primarily from Arsenal's Cliff Bastin (who received 21 caps), but also from others, such as Aston Villa's Eric Houghton (who received 7 caps), Sheffield Wednesday's Ellis Rimmer (who received 4 caps) and West Ham's Jimmy Ruffell (who received six caps) and Jackie Morton (who received one cap). However, the versatility of Brook and Bastin meant that they often played together for England, usually with Bastin playing in the inside left position (in a game against Scotland in 1935 Bastin played at inside right). When they played together, Brook and Bastin would interchange at will, switches which often confused opposition defences. p96 Despite the rivalry, Brook and Bastin were in the latter's words 'always the greatest of friends'. The only players to have scored more goals for England, prior to the second world war, who did not play in the centre forward or inside forward positions were Cliff Bastin and Charles Bambridge. Only twelve players in total scored more goals for England than Brook prior to the war. In addition to playing for England, Brook often competed in trial matches for the Rest of England against the national team."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Seed", "response": ["Seed made his Wednesday debut on 27 August 1927 in the first match of the 1927\u201328 season against Everton. During the first part of the season Seed was asked to play in numerous different positions by manager Bob Brown as Wednesday struggled in Division One. By mid March 1928 they had won only six matches out of 32 and were seven points adrift at the foot of the table. At that stage Seed was made team captain with existing skipper Fred Keen being dropped, Ellis Rimmer was bought from Tranmere Rovers and these changes triggered an amazing recovery. Wednesday picked up 17 points out of a possible 20 in the last ten matches and avoided relegation by a point. The irony was that it was Seed's old club Tottenham who were relegated on the final day of the season."]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Jack Ball &Ellis Rimmer", "|Ellis Rimmer"]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["| Ellis Rimmer"]}, {"page": "1935 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The 1935 FA Cup Final was contested by Sheffield Wednesday and West Bromwich Albion at Wembley. Sheffield Wednesday won 4\u20132, with goals scored by Jack Palethorpe, Mark Hooper and Ellis Rimmer (2). Wally Boyes and Teddy Sandford scored West Brom's goals. It is the most recent time that the trophy has been won by Sheffield Wednesday, and would be their last major trophy win for 56 years, until they won the Football League Cup in 1991.", "West Brom went into the match as favourites even though they were below Wednesday in the table, pundits believing that they had the better forward players with Wally Boyes, W.G. Richardson and Teddy Sandford all having notched over 20 League goals for the season. The two teams had actually met in a League game five days earlier on Easter Monday and drawn 1\u20131 at The Hawthorns. Wednesday went into the match with a full strength squad and fielded the same starting eleven that they had for every round except the third, Ellis Rimmer was their ace in the pack having scored in every round up to the final. West Brom brought back Joe Carter into the team having been absent with a knee injury since the semi-final. Harry Jones being the unlucky player to miss out. In hindsight the decision to play Carter was clearly a gamble and a mistake with no substitutes allowed. Carter was limping after only ten minutes of the match and missed two second half chances which he may have taken if he had been fully fit. Another controversial move by West Brom was the decision to leave out Arthur Gale who had played in all six FA Cup ties leading up to the final that season, scoring four goals from the right wing. Gale was replaced by Tommy Glidden who was effectively shackled by Wednesday's left back Ted Catlin.", "The early stages of the second half saw Ronnie Starling miss a chance and then have another effort cleared off the line. Not to be deterred Starling was prominent in Wednesday re-taking the lead on 70 minutes when his pass released Mark Hooper who beat two men before hitting a shot past Harold Pearson that went in off a post. Within five minutes West Brom were level as a Teddy Sandford shot was deflected into the net off Walt Millership. At this stage West Brom looked the likely winners with some of the Wednesday players arguing amongst themselves as they kicked off. It was during this stage of the game that the limping Joe Carter missed his two good chances, hitting the post with one of them. W. G. Richardson also missed a fine opportunity. With only five minutes remaining and extra time looking a distinct possibility Ellis Rimmer, who had had a quiet match up till that point made his mark on the match. He chased a long through ball from Wilf Sharp and the tall winger got his head to the ball just before West Brom keeper Pearson could reach it and guided it into the net. In the final minute Rimmer scored his second goal when Pearson could only parry a Mark Hooper shot and Rimmer knocked the ball home from close range. Wednesday had won the cup and Ellis Rimmer had scored in every round.\"Sheffield Football, A History\", Keith Farnsworth,  Page 200 (Gives details of match).\"Wednesday\", Keith Farnsworth, pages 132\u2013135 (Gives details of match and team selections).", "| ||11|| Ellis Rimmer"]}, {"page": "Alfred Strange", "response": ["Strange was selected to represent the Football League three times, before receiving his first England cap for the match against Scotland on 5 April 1930.

He played 15 games in the remainder of that season scoring two goals. The following season, he netted 22 goals for Wednesday (a record at the time for a winger) as he finished as top scorer and played a vital part in Wednesday's \"Great Escape\" season of 1927\u201328. Towards the end of that season he was joined at the club by left winger Ellis Rimmer and the pair were feted as one of the best pair of extreme wingers in the game. Another accolade often aimed at Hooper in his time at Wednesday was that he was \"the best uncapped winger in the country\", during his best years he was kept out of the England side by Derby County's fine right winger Sammy Crooks."]}, {"page": "1934\u201335 FA Cup", "response": ["The 1934\u201335 FA Cup was the 60th season of the world's oldest football cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup.
