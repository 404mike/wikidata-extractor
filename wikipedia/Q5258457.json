His first-class debut, and his only outing for Worcestershire, was against the Combined Services at New Road in 1946. He took the single wicket of the 19-year-old John Dewes and scored 1 and 6 with the bat. The following year he appeared thrice for Glamorgan, claiming seven more wickets (though never more than two in an innings) and managing a top score of 21 in his final game at Derby.\nHe did his National Service in the Royal Air Force, and played league cricket for a while in the north of England. He migrated to Canada in 1952, and set up his own textile importing business in Quebec. After he retired, he lived in Ontario. For some time before his death in June 2021 he was Worcestershire's oldest surviving first-class cricketer. His wife Mary, to whom he was married for 64 years, predeceased him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Dennis Good (1947) : D. C.
