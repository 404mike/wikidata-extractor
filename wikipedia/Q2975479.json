After making five appearances and scoring two goals he was recalled by Scunthorpe on 5 November due to the departure of on-loan Millwall striker Ben May. Despite this, York manager Billy McEwan was interested in bringing McBreen back to the club for another loan spell. He bought out the remainder of his Scunthorpe contract to join St Johnstone of the Scottish First Division on 2 January 2008 on a contract until the end of the season. His debut came the same day in a 1\u20131 home draw with Dundee, which he entered as a 62nd-minute substitute for Liam Craig. He suffered a knee injury during this match, and this hampered his progress at the club. On 20 April, McBreen scored the opening goal with a back-post header from Paul Sheerin's cross in St Johnstone's Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers at Hampden Park in extra time, which they eventually lost in a penalty shoot-out.

An early goal for the hosts was ruled out for a handball, and a resulting yellow card for the defender. From a clever corner routine Jason Thomson curled the ball through to Kirk, who fired in from short range. At this point Kirk was now the leading goalscorer in the SPL. Martin Hardie then went close to scoring against his former club with a header from a corner. With half an hour to go in the game John Potter tripped Francisco Sandaza and was sent off,(though this was later rescinded to a yellow</) with a penalty awarded to the hosts. The resulting penalty was taken by Liam Craig and was saved by Paul Gallacher, his second penalty save in three games. Despite the extra man advantage St Johnstone rarely looked like scoring and the few chances they did have was dealt with by the keeper comfortably. Final Score: 1\u20130</"]}]}}
