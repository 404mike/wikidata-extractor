At the venue he saw off Michael Wasley 5\u20131, before losing 5\u20132 to David Morris in the second round. Greene reached his first final after 20 years as a professional at the minor-ranking Paul Hunter Classic in August. He won four matches to reach the quarter-finals where he beat Joe Swail 4\u20131, then held his nerve against Ali Carter to win 4\u20133 after leading 3\u20130. In the final he faced Ronnie O'Sullivan and was defeated 4\u20130 in 44 minutes. He secured the highest break in the qualifying rounds of the International Championships, a break of 142 in a 6\u20135 defeat to Thepchaiya Un-Nooh.

His season seemed to be heading for an anti-climax as he could not win more than one match in any event until he played in the PTC Finals.

The wins kept on coming for Greene as he knocked out number one seed Mark Allen 4\u20132 and Marco Fu 4\u20132 to play in his first ranking event final. After his semi-final match with Fu, Greene stated that the week had made him feel like a professional snooker player for the first time in two years as he had been playing well against the top players. He played practice partner Barry Hawkins in the final and did not pot a ball in the first two frames and went on to be beaten 4\u20130, but the \u00a338,000 runner-up's cheque is the biggest of his career to date.
