Stevenage levelled through Mark Roberts, who scored from close range after the Dagenham defence had failed to clear a free-kick. The home side responded instantly with two goals in quick succession through Josh Scott and a Michael Spillane penalty. Second-half substitute Robin Shroot halved Stevenage's deficit with a driven effort fifteen minutes from time, although ultimately it was Dagenham who held on to progress to the Second Round."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Dominic Green"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Dominic Green "]}, {"page": "Jodi Jones (footballer)", "response": ["Jones was born in Bow, London and started his career with the renowned local junior side Senrab. He later joined the youth system at Dagenham & Redbridge at under-13 level and in the summer of 2014, he started a two-year scholarship with the club. In November 2014, despite still a first-year scholar, he was handed a squad number with the first team ahead of the league fixture against Bury, after he had impressed in an Essex Senior Cup tie win over Concord Rangers. However, he did not make the bench and wasn't included in the first team squad until January 2015, when he was an unused substitute against Cambridge United.He made his first team debut in February 2015, coming on as a last minute substitute for Alex Jakubiak in a 0\u20130 draw with Portsmouth. In the process he became the youngest Dagenham & Redbridge player to appear in a league game, beating the previous record set by Dominic Green. In March 2015, he signed his first professional contract on a two-year deal until 2017. In April 2015, Jones made his full debut for the Daggers in the 4\u20130 home win over Accrington Stanley, scoring in the final minute with his first goal for the club."]}]}}
