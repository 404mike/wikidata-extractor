Oberman had had difficulty deciding where to transpose Chekhov's narrative, with Samuels offering up the idea of Liverpool, her home town, and the two agreeing on the post-war time frame: \"Liverpudlians have their black sense of humour and comic timing, born out of having their city blown to smithereens during the war\". This informed the new Jewish sensibility of the play which was anchored to the tone of Chekhov's original, where the melodrama of the Pozorov family masked the pain and social upheaval all about them. Oberman felt this echoed the way the Jewish community in Britain acted in the wake of the Holocaust: \"people that close to the Second World War just didn\u2019t talk about it \u2013 a bit like the elephant in the room\". The intent of the play was \"to take a family who has the Holocaust hanging over them, and still have them laugh and moan and bicker while wondering what's for breakfast\".", "Category:English plays by Diane Samuels"]}]}}
