Griffith's 1916 historical epic Intolerance. He appeared in 239 films between 1908 and 1918. Prior to his film career, he had served from 1899 to 1903 in the Royal Horse Guards of the British Army. \nHe served in South Africa during the Second Boer War from July to November 1900, receiving the Queen's South Africa Medal with clasps for Cape Colony, Orange Free State, and Transvaal. In April 1918 he travelled to Canada and enrolled in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, being assigned to the 34th Fort Garry Horse Depot Squadron in Winnipeg as an instructor, being quickly promoted to the rank of Sergeant due to his previous service and experience. \nPaget was married to Leila Halstead. In the summer of 1919, he contracted a form of malarial fever, and died in Winnipeg on 8 October 1919. He is buried in the Field Of Honour in Brookside Cemetery, Winnipeg.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Intolerance (film)", "response": ["* Alfred Paget as Prince Belshazzar"]}, {"page": "The Musketeers of Pig Alley", "response": ["* Alfred Paget \u2013 Rival Gang Leader"]}, {"page": "Judith of Bethulia", "response": ["* Alfred Paget - Bethulian/Assyrian Soldier"]}, {"page": "Brute Force (1914 film)", "response": ["*Alfred Paget as In Club (Prologue) / Tribesman (The Old Days)"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1917", "response": ["| Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp || Chester Franklin, Sidney Franklin || Francis Carpenter, Virginia Lee Corbin, Alfred Paget || Fantasy || Fox"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1915", "response": ["|Enoch Arden || Christy Cabanne || Alfred Paget, Lillian Gish || Drama || Mutual Film"]}, {"page": "Oil and Water (film)", "response": ["* Alfred Paget - Among Dancers"]}, {"page": "List of crime films before 1930", "response": ["|The Musketeers of Pig Alley||D.W.
