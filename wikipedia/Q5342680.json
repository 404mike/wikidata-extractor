For the final section, she wrote a song with lyrics from the poem \"In Flanders Fields\" , sung by counter tenor Jonathan Peter Kenny. She also used a recording of WWI soldier Edward Dwyer describing the war and singing \"we\u2019re here because we\u2019re here\" to the melody of \"Auld Lang Syne\". Pook said she had that recording prior to composing this ballet, but initially did not know Dwyer died in the war."]}]}}
