He also attended a private school in Southport where he came into contact with a Swiss master called Dr Knecht.  Leaving school he became an apprentice to a photographer in Southport but then decided to study engineering.  In 1871 he became an engineer at the Gaskell\u2013Deacon Works in Widnes, Lancashire where the chief chemist was the Swiss Ferdinand Hurter.  Through a common interest in music they became friends and around 1876 Driffield persuaded Hurter to take up photography as a hobby.  Hurter applied his scientific mind to photography and together they carried out important research into the subject.  They published eight papers and in 1898 they were jointly awarded the Progress Medal of the Royal Photographic Society.Driffield died in 1915 and is buried in the churchyard of Farnworth church near his former collaborator Ferdinand Hurter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Film speed", "response": ["Another early practical system for measuring the sensitivity of an emulsion was that of Hurter and Driffield (H&D), originally described in 1890, by the Swiss-born Ferdinand Hurter (1844\u20131898) and British Vero Charles Driffield (1848\u20131915).

Hurter remained a Swiss citizen throughout his life and sent his children to receive part of their education in Switzerland.  He enjoyed music and played the clarinet and piano.  He also took an interest in photography, collaborating in research with Vero Charles Driffield, an engineer at the Gaskell-Deacon works.
