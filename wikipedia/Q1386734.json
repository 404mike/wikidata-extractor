He started his senior career with Hearts, and won the Scottish Cup with the club in 1891. He played for Everton for two seasons from 1894 to 1896, before playing one final season for Hearts in 1896\u201397. Adams won three caps for Scotland, spread across four years.\nAdams once deliberately handled the ball to prevent it scoring a goal, and the outcry resulting from this incident led to the introduction of the penalty kick. After retiring as a player, Adams became a football referee. He later emigrated to the US and worked as a mason, and he died in New Jersey in 1943.", "link_mentions": {}}}
