He started his senior career with Hearts, and won the Scottish Cup with the club in 1891. He played for Everton for two seasons from 1894 to 1896, before playing one final season for Hearts in 1896\u201397. Adams won three caps for Scotland, spread across four years.\nAdams once deliberately handled the ball to prevent it scoring a goal, and the outcry resulting from this incident led to the introduction of the penalty kick. After retiring as a player, Adams became a football referee. He later emigrated to the US and worked as a mason, and he died in New Jersey in 1943.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Adams", "response": ["James Adams may refer to:", "*James Adams (Jesuit) (1737\u20131802), English philologist", "*James Adams (entrepreneur), American author and entrepreneur", "*James Adams (character), character in the CHERUB series by Robert Muchamore", "*James Adams (MP) (1752\u20131816), British Member of Parliament and Lord of the Admiralty", "*James Adams (Massachusetts politician) (1810\u20131880), mayor of Charlestown, Massachusetts", "*James Adams (diplomat) (1932\u20132020), British diplomat", "*W.

This meant that Jack Hillman was the undisputed first choice goalkeeper for the season and would go on to play all bar the final game in which Harry Briggs made his club debut in a 2\u20131 victory at Stoke. Bob Kelso, Charlie Parry and James Adams resumed their battle for the two full back positions from the previous season. Adams missed the first game of the season but returned to miss just one other game as he established himself as the first choice full back but Both Kelso and Parry fell out of favour as reserve, Smart Arridge emerged as a solid full back partner to Adams. Kelso, who played the first five games of the season, made just one further appearance for the club in the half back line before leaving to join Dundee in February. Parry's long love, hate relationship with the Goodison Park club finally came to an end after his second appearance of the season when he gave away a penalty, which was missed, in a 3\u20134 defeat at Aston Villa in September.Liverpool Mercury Newspaper 1 October 1895 Before the year was out the Welsh International defender had moved on to Ardwick.", "|James Adams, Dickie Boyle", "|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| James Adams"]}, {"page": "James Adams (footballer born 1864)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Adams (footballer, born 1864)"]}, {"page": "1896\u201397 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["Elsewhere the familiar half back line of Boyle, Holt & Stewart would line up in front of full back, Smart Arridge, who would be partnered in defence this year by David Storrier after James Adams had returned to his former club Hearts"]}]}}
