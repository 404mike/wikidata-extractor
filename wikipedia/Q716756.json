The unexpected loss to the Midlands side was Hoddle's last match for Spurs as newly appointed AS Monaco manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger brought him to the principality for a fee of \u00a3750,000. Between 1975 and 1987, the gifted playmaker scored 110 goals in 490 first-team matches in all competitions, only four players (Steve Perryman, Pat Jennings, Gary Mabbutt and Cyril Knowles) have made more appearances in a Spurs shirt. At international level, Hoddle won 44 caps for England during his Tottenham career."]}, {"page": "Bill Nicholson (footballer)", "response": ["After quitting the Spurs manager's job, Nicholson spent a year at West Ham United as an advisor and a scout. When Keith Burkinshaw became Spurs' manager in 1976, one of his first requests was that Nicholson be brought back to White Hart Lane as a consultant. His knowledge and experience were invaluable, and he showed that he still had an eye for players by recommending several to Burkinshaw, including Graham Roberts, Tony Galvin, and Gary Mabbutt. Nicholson continued to work as a consultant until 1991, when he was awarded the title of Club President."]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Gary Mabbutt"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Gary Mabbutt"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Gary Mabbutt"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Gary Mabbutt"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Gary Mabbutt"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Gary Mabbutt"]}, {"page": "Crazy Gang (football)", "response": ["Although the club had been known for its players' oftentimes outlandish behaviour since the early 1980s, the team became more widely recognised for it following their promotion to the First Division in 1986. Practical jokes and initiations for new players were commonplace; these ranged from players being stripped and forced to walk home naked to belongings being set on fire to players being tied to the roof of a car at the training ground and driven at high speeds along the A3 among a multitude of others, with long-serving midfielder Vinnie Jones saying \"you either grew a backbone quickly or dissolved as a man\", in reference to the club's boisterous culture. As the now top-flight team received more attention for their antics from the media, they also became subject to criticism from many pundits and fellow players, who accused the team of taking a \"simplified, overly aggressive, and intimidating\" approach to football in comparison to the other teams in the league. This newfound scrutiny created a close bond and tenacious camaraderie among the players, who adopted an \"us vs them\" mentality on the field as more and more opposing teams feared the side and their reputation. Players such as Vinnie Jones and John Fashanu were often accused of showing little regard for their opponents and deliberately making dangerous, risky tackles. Both received significant attention after both Gary Stevens and Gary Mabbutt of Tottenham Hotspur were injured in separate incidents following challenges from Jones and Fashanu respectively; Stevens never fully recovered from the injuries suffered as a result of Jones' tackle and retired four years later."]}, {"page": "Brian Kilcline", "response": ["Kilcline captained Coventry City in the 1987 FA Cup Final at Wembley against Tottenham Hotspur. At the time it was thought that Kilcline was possibly responsible for scoring an own-goal to give Spurs a 2\u20131 lead on the 40 minute mark, but this goal was eventually accredited to Gary Mabbutt. Kilcline and Mabbutt were to clash again in the second half when Kilcline brought down Mabbutt with a tackle. Kilcline was not cautioned by referee Neil Midgley but had to be replaced by substitute Graham Rodger just a minute before the end of normal time due to the injury he himself sustained in the clash. After Coventry's extra time winner (the match finished 3-2) Kilcline limped slowly up the famous Wembley step to receive the trophy for the only time in Coventry's history."]}, {"page": "Gu\u00f0ni Bergsson", "response": ["At Spurs, the central defender or full back teamed up with England internationals Paul Gascoigne, Gary Mabbutt, Gary Lineker and Chris Waddle. Understandably, he found it hard to make a regular breakthrough for the London club often filling in intermittently due to injuries or suspension. This did not stop him from becoming a regular for the Icelandic national team, where he eventually became captain winning in excess of 80 caps, which was a record for that country at the time."]}, {"page": "North London derby", "response": ["Tottenham's record for goals scored against Arsenal is 11 goals by Harry Kane, with Bobby Smith scoring 10 goals followed by Billy Minter with nine goals. Arsenal's record is held jointly by Emmanuel Adebayor, Alan Sunderland and Robert Pires, with eight goals each. Adebayor also formerly shared the record for most goals by a player in the North London derby with ten: eight scored for Arsenal and two for Tottenham. Arsenal's long-time defender David O'Leary holds the record for most North London derbies played with 35, while Gary Mabbutt and Steve Perryman shared the corresponding record for Spurs, with 31."]}, {"page": "Tommy Hutchison", "response": ["Hutchison joined Manchester City for a fee of \u00a347,000 in October 1980, becoming John Bond's first signing at Maine Road. In May 1981, he scored for both sides in the FA Cup Final, as Tottenham Hotspur drew 1\u20131 with Manchester City. He was not the first to do this \u2014 Bert Turner had done so in the 1946 final for Charlton and Derby, and Gary Mabbutt would do the same in the 1987 final for Coventry City and Tottenham Hotspur. He had initially put City in the lead, but his own goal (deflecting a free-kick) meant that the final would go to a replay, which City lost 3\u20132 five days later."]}]}}
