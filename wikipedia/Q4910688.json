A right-handed batsman who could play aggressively, but with a sound defensive method, Roe was considered one of Somerset's leading batsmen of the era. He played without merit for Cambridge, and only achieved his Blue during his final year at the university.\nRoe gained cricketing fame in the summer of 1881, when he was drafted into the Emmanuel College Long Vacation Club cricket team for their match against a similar team from Gonville and Caius. After Caius had scored 100 runs, Roe batted for the rest of the game to reach 415 runs, the highest score in cricket at the time, just passing the previous total of 404 by Edward Tylecote. The match was reported across the contemporary press, though it was stressed that the quality of the opposition bowling was weak. Roe's first-class career never reached the heights it might have done; he was generally an inconsistent scorer, and scored just four hundreds in first-class cricket. His struggles were mirrored by his county side, Somerset, who flitted between first- and second-class cricket during his career. He played for the county from 1879 until 1899, and scored 2,690 runs in all first-class matches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herbie Hewett", "response": ["Hewett led his side in their first County Championship match starting on 18 May 1891. Although the club had played first-class cricket a few years earlier, the championship had only been formed the previous season. Their debut in the competition was interrupted by rain and finished a draw; Hewett top-scored in Somerset's only innings with 31. Somerset's next match was against reigning county champions Surrey. Lionel Palairet, Bill Roe and Sammy Woods were all missing for various reasons, leaving Hewett with a depleted side and only two real bowlers; Ted Tyler and George Nichols. Surrey reached 449, and then bowled Somerset out twice, for 37 in each innings.Foot (1986), pp. 28\u201329. When Surrey travelled to Taunton later that season, most likely expecting an easy win to secure a second consecutive championship, Hewett top-scored for his team with 55 in the first-innings as Somerset reached 194. Woods, Nichols and Tyler then secured a 40 run first-innings lead for the home side who added another 331 runs in their second-innings, Hewett contributing 42. The same trio of Somerset bowlers proceeded to bowl the champions out for a second time, the final wicket falling two minutes from the close of play, and their team recorded a 130-run victory.Foot (1986), pp. 29\u201332. Hewett had a quiet season with the bat, in addition to his 55 against Surrey he passed 50 on only one other occasion; against Middlesex two weeks later. He totalled 514 runs during the season at an average of 19.76; his lowest average when playing eight or more innings in a season."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Bill Roe (1882\u20131899) 66 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Stephen Newton", "response": ["During these pre-first-class seasons, Newton made a name for himself, and in his official history of the club, Peter Roebuck describes him as one of the talents of the side.Roebuck (1991), p. 20. He took on the captaincy of the club in 1880, a season in which he passed 30 runs in five of the recorded seven innings in which he played. His highest score recorded on CricketArchive during these years for Somerset was the 91 which he scored in 1876 against the Gentlemen of Dorset. Team-mate Bill Roe described Newton as a useful batsman who favoured playing balls on his pads.Commonly known as pad play, removing the danger of being caught. In his obituary, Newton was described as being \"a most excellent field\", particularly strong at cover-point, while Haygarth's Scores and Biographies characterised him as \"a fine and free hitter, and a most excellent field\". He was the county's top run-scorer in 1877, accumulating 285 runs at an average of 25.90, and he was also one of their principle bowlers, collecting 21 wickets during the season. He remained near the top of the batting charts for the club the following year, scoring the second-most runs behind Edward Sainsbury, 146 at an average of 18.25. He was used less as a bowler than in the previous year, taking just six wickets. He once again trailed only Sainsbury amongst batsmen in 1880, scoring 278 runs at an average of 30.88. He was appointed as the club captain for 1881, though he was not able to play as frequently for the club, and finished the season with 93 runs from five innings at an average of 18.3."]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Towards the end of the 1870s, journalists had suggested that Somerset chose their players \"upon breeding rather than skill\".Roebuck (1991), p. 20. The best players in the county, many of whom were not wealthy men, were unable to afford to play for Somerset. In turn, the cricket club could not afford to pay professionals to play for them, and were regarded as an occasional amateur outfit by many, rather than a side that could truly represent the strength of cricket within the county. The arrival of two professional players, and the acquisition of a permanent home ground in Taunton helped strengthen the club so that in 1882 they were admitted as a first-class county.Roebuck (1991), pp. 20\u201328. Bill Roe, at the time a schoolboy, rated Sainsbury as \"by far the best batsman in the side\" during their pre-first-class years. On 8 June 1882, Somerset played their first match to be universally considered first-class, against Lancashire. After losing the toss and fielding for over 150 overs as Lancashire scored 237, Somerset responded with a first innings total of 29 \u2013 their second lowest total ever in first-class cricket. Sainsbury and his fellow opening batsman, Fowler, top-scored for Somerset with 9\u00a0runs each, and both were once again the highest scorers in the second innings, when Fowler scored 18 and Sainsbury 17\u00a0runs out of a total of 51. Somerset were beaten by an innings and 157 runs, and batted for less than 70\u00a0overs. The county suffered further heavy defeats in their next two matches, losing to Gloucestershire and Hampshire, with no Somerset batsman reaching a half-century in either match. Sainsbury reached his first half-century in first-class cricket when Somerset hosted Hampshire at the County Ground \u2013 teammates Robert Ramsay and Stephen Newton also passed 50 for the county in this match, which helped Somerset to their maiden first-class victory. Sainsbury claimed a wicket in each innings of the match, during which he bowled just eight overs: in the first innings he bowled one over, conceding one run and claiming one wicket. In first-class matches in 1882, Sainsbury scored 255 runs at an average of 17.00, exceeding 50 on only one occasion. He bowled infrequently, claiming four wickets at an average in excess of 40."]}, {"page": "William Roe", "response": ["*Bill Roe (cricketer) (1861\u20131937), English cricketer", "*Bill Roe (American football) (1958\u20132003), American football linebacker"]}, {"page": "George Nash (cricketer)", "response": ["Very much a bowler, Nash's highest score batting in first-class cricket was 30.

Playing six matches, there were a total of 120\u00a0wickets on offer, but Somerset's bowlers took only 67. Edward Bastard, a slow left-arm orthodox bowler, was the county's leading wicket-taker, claiming 25\u00a0wickets during his four appearances, at an average of 15.32. His bowling average was not far below that of George Lohmann, who finished the season as the country's leading wicket taker, with 142\u00a0wickets from his 24\u00a0matches. Unfortunately for Somerset, Bastard was only able to play in four of the county's six matches, and of the other bowlers, the best bowling average was the 25.85 managed by Bill Roe, who took only seven wickets.

Later in the summer he claimed eight wickets against Lancashire, and then picked up 12 wickets against the touring Australians. In the match against the Australians, he collected five wickets in the first innings and seven in the second, albeit more expensively than in the match against the MCC. He was less prolific against Lancashire for Somerset, during a match played in such cold weather that catches were hard to hold. Bill Roe said that during this match, Lancashire's number eleven, George Nash was dropped off every ball of an over bowled by Ramsay, before Roe himself caught Nash off the first ball of the following over. Ramsay was selected to play for the \"Gentlemen of England\" against the touring Australians, and claimed three wickets in a match which the Australians won by an innings.
