This porous material could emit visible light when a current was passed through it (electroluminescence).\nLater the group demonstrated the biocompatibility of porous silicon.\nCanham now works as Chief Scientific Officer of psiMedica (part of pSiVida). According to the pSiVida web site, Canham is the most cited author on porous silicon. In a study of most cited physicists up to 1997 Canham ranked at 771.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Porous silicon", "response": ["Despite the discovery of porous silicon in the 1950s, the scientific community was not interested in porous silicon until the late 1980s.

The intuition was followed by successful experimental results published in 1990. In the published experiment, it was revealed that silicon wafers can emit light if subjected to electrochemical and chemical dissolution."]}, {"page": "Canham", "response": ["* Leigh Canham (born 1958), British scientist"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Leigh Canham \u2013 optoelectronics physicist"]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (L)", "response": ["*Leigh Canham"]}]}}
