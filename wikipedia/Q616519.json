The daughter of the producer and playwright Robert Courtneidge, she was appearing in his productions in the West End by the age of 16, and was quickly promoted from minor to major roles in his Edwardian musical comedies.\nAfter the outbreak of the First World War, her father had a series of failures and temporarily withdrew from production. No other producers offered the young Courtneidge leading roles in musical comedies, and she turned instead to the music hall, learning her craft as a comedian.  In 1916 she married the actor and dancer Jack Hulbert, with whom she formed a professional as well as a matrimonial partnership that lasted until his death 62 years later. They acted together on stage and screen, initially in a series of revues, with Hulbert frequently producing as well as performing.\nCourtneidge appeared in 12 British films in the 1930s, and one in Hollywood, finding this work to be very lucrative. She and Hulbert also recorded for Columbia and HMV, returning to the stage in the late 1930s. During the Second World War, Courtneidge entertained the armed forces and raised funds for the troops.  She then had a long run in Under the Counter, a comedy in which she received glowing notices.  Notable among her other successes was Courtneidge's performance in Ivor Novello's musical Gay's the Word in 1951\u201352.  During the rest of the decade, she focused on revues and straight plays.\nAfter the mid-1960s, Courtneidge concentrated on the non-musical theatre, appearing in the West End and on tour in a range of plays, both serious and comic. While appearing in her last West End run in 1971, she celebrated 70 years on the stage.  Afterwards, she continued to work for a further five years before retiring.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 1", "response": ["*1893 \u2013 Cicely Courtneidge, Australian-English actress (d. 1980)"]}, {"page": "April 26", "response": ["*1980 \u2013 Cicely Courtneidge, Australian-born British actress, comedian and singer (b. 1893)"]}, {"page": "1980", "response": ["* April 26 \u2013 Cicely Courtneidge, British actress (b. 1893)Pepys-Whiteley, D. \"Courtneidge, Dame (Esmerelda) Cicely (1893\u20131980)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2011, accessed 8 August 2011 "]}, {"page": "1893", "response": ["* April 1 \u2013 Cicely Courtneidge, British actress (d. 1980)"]}, {"page": "Ivor Novello", "response": ["Novello's last full-scale production in this style, King's Rhapsody (1949), was, in Webb's words, \"a selfconsciously romantic counter-blast to the modern musical: crown princes, ballrooms, royal yachts, beautiful princesses and a full-scale coronation\".
