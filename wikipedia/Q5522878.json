But this came to nothing and after a brief trial with his former club Wrexham in late 2009, he signed for Barrow in March 2010, and ironically made his debut against Wrexham later in the month. Two months he lifted his first trophy with the club after a 2\u20131 win over Stevenage Borough in the FA Trophy final. At the end of the season the club released left-back Gareth Jelleyman, with the intention that Edwards would fulfil this role the following season. However the club soon discovered that Edwards had also been offered a trial with Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Edwards failed to gain a contract in Scotland however, and returned to Barrow just after the start of the 2010\u201311 season. In May 2011 he was offered a new contract by Barrow, having made a 43-game haul in the 2010\u201311 campaign."]}, {"page": "Sean Newton", "response": ["On 17 July 2009, Newton signed for Conference Premier club Barrow.
