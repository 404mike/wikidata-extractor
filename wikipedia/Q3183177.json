He formerly played rugby union at fullback for Bath and England. He is the brother of ex-Newport RFC player Nigel Callard.\nCallard taught physical education classes and sports classes at Downside School (Somerset) in the early to mid-1990s. He also taught Biology to younger students.\nCallard joined Bath from Newport in 1989. In November 1993 he made his international debut for England against the All Blacks, which saw England cause an upset, winning 15\u20139. Callard enjoyed a fine debut, scoring 12 points from four successful penalties. In February 1994, on his second appearance for England, Callard was again the England's hero in the 1994 Five Nations Championship match between Scotland and England at the newly rebuilt Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.\nHe kicked all of England's points from five penalties, in a scrappy and closely fought match, as England narrowly beat Scotland 15\u201314. Controversially, the winning penalty came deep into stoppage time at the end of the match with the score at 12\u201314, when the referee erroneously gave a penalty against Scotland in the final climactic tussle for possession. Video replays later confirmed that the ball was handled on the ground in a ruck by Rob Andrew, and the referee, believing it had been handled illegally by Scottish player Ian Jardine, awarded England a penalty. England's white jersey that season had 'blue' cuffs that matched the Scotland jersey, which could be easily mistaken in a mass crowd of bodies. Callard held his nerve against a cacophony of booing and jeering from the home fans and successfully kicked the resultant penalty, from nearly 50 yards out. As the kick went between the posts, the referee blew the final whistle, and Callard celebrated wildly with his relieved England teammates.\nThe adulation he received in the wake of such a dramatic victory was fleeting however, as despite his match winning performance against Scotland, Callard was criticised after England's next match, a fortnight later, against Ireland at Twickenham. He missed four penalty attempts, and also failed to prevent an Irish try by Simon Geoghegan. Although he managed to convert four penalties in the match, England still lost 13\u201312. The defeat ended England's chances of a Grand Slam and reduced their chances of winning the Championship. Callard, along with several other players were consequently dropped from the England side for the remainder of the Five Nations campaign. England's form improved and they won their remaining two matches but still lost out on the Five Nations Championship on points difference to Wales.\nDespite continuing to be selected for future England squads, including for their 1994 Summer Tour of South Africa, he fell behind, initially Paul Hull, and later Mike Catt, Tim Stimpson and Matt Perry as England's first choice Full Back. The intense competition for places in the England side over the next few years meant that Callard would only gain a total of five caps for England, although he did score an impressive total of 69 points in that time. He played in one solitary match in the 1995 Rugby World Cup against Western Samoa, scoring 21 points from the boot, in a 44\u201322 win that helped England progress to the Quarter Finals. Callard won his last cap for England in November 1995, in a 24\u201314 defeat to South Africa.\nAt club level with Bath he was part of a very successful side in the early to mid 1990s which won five English Courage League Premiership titles, as well as five Pilkington Cup titles. His crowning achievement came late in his career when he scored all 19 of Bath's points in their 1998 Heineken Cup final victory over Brive. In August 1998 Callard was appointed assistant coach to Andy Robinson at Bath, before being made Head Coach in 2000. In 2002 he became assistant coach to Phil Davies at Leeds Tykes and later that year was also appointed as head coach of the England U21s. During his time at Leeds he coached them to victory the 2004\u201305 Powergen Cup, in the final of which they defeated his old side Bath. He joined the Rugby Football Union's National Academy in summer 2005.\nCallard was appointed kicking coach to the senior England rugby team for the Rugby World Cup 2007.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bath Rugby", "response": ["Jack Rowell's departure (to take control of the England team) in 1995 and rugby union becoming a professional sport in 1996 has seen Bath struggle to find consistency either on or off the field. With regular changes in the coaching staff (including Andy Robinson's appointment as England's head coach) and with a seemingly steady turnaround of players, the formula that led to past successes is still being sought. However, Bath captained by Andy Nicol still managed to be the first British club to lift the Heineken Cup, in the 1997\u20131998 season.

Within 90 seconds of the kick-off, Martin Offiah touched down for Wigan, but was penalised for a foot in touch. However, with only three minutes gone, Offiah scored the first of his six tries of the night. The difficulties that Bath had with coming to terms with the game led to further tries for Offiah (2), Henry Paul, Jason Robinson, Terry O'Connor, Andy Johnson, Craig Murdock and Scott Quinnell, with the score at half-time 52\u20130. The first half proved to be such a mismatch that it was more than fifteen minutes before Bath were able to get through a set of tackles without making an error.", "Bath again kicked the game off, but this time, rather than conceding a penalty, Jon Callard's kick enabled Martin Haag to take and recycle the ball, allowing Bath's forwards an early opportunity to ruck and maul against opponents unused to this type of play, with Wigan failing to win any of the first twenty rucks. Only a Bath knock-on during the drive prevented a repeat of the first game and an early try for the experts. What this meant though was the Wigan pack engaging in a union scrum early on, and coming to terms with the differences of this compared with a typically uncontested scrum in their own game. Indeed, it was through scrummaging inexperience that Wigan conceded their first try, a penalty try given through their repeated collapsing of the scrum. It was 18 minutes until Wigan handled the ball in the opposition half, with Bath gaining further tries through Adedayo Adebayo (2) and Jon Sleightholme prior to half-time, allowing the Courage League champions to build an unanswered 25-point lead at the break. Jonathan Davies, the dual-code international, made the observation that Wigan were suffering from constant infringements of \"rules they didn't know existed\".", "Although Bath were evidently outmatched in the first game, they were able to take some positives; Phil de Glanville made the most tackles of any back on either side, while de Glanville, Steve Ojomoh, Jon Callard and Adedayo Adebayo all impressed watching league experts. Similarly, in the second game, as Bath tired, Wigan were able to exploit both their superior fitness and their superior running game to gain a foothold during the second half. However, one of Bath's star players at the time, England centre Jeremy Guscott, refused to play in the series, as he felt that there was a lack of balance between the two games - the only alteration that took place in the league fixture came at half-time when Bath requested unlimited substitutions (rather than the fixed number of ten interchanges normally permitted); apart from this, the match was played as a standard, full intensity game of rugby league. In the union fixture however, although there was a greater intensity to the scrummaging than league players would normally experience, the scrums were not fully contested, as scrummaging in rugby union is highly technical, particularly in the front row. Had the scrums been fully contested, Guscott stated that it was likely a number of the Wigan forwards could have been seriously injured. But, this meant that Wigan were able to gain more of a foothold in the union fixture than Bath had been able to do in the league fixture."]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Powergen Cup", "response": ["|colspan=\"4\"| Jon Callard"]}, {"page": "2014 June rugby union tests", "response": ["|colspan=\"4\"| Jon Callard", "* Jon Callard coached England, with Lancaster in New Zealand with the touring 30-man squad."]}, {"page": "2014 England rugby union tour of New Zealand", "response": ["On 26 May, Stuart Lancaster named two squads.
