Its author has been identified with Columbanus of Saint Trond, who, it is claimed, also wrote the Ad Fidolium, a set of quantitative adonics.The identification of the Columbanus of Saint Trond with the Columbanus who composed the adonic verse is supported by Johannes Smit (1971), Studies on the Language and Style of Columba the Younger (Columbanus) (Amsterdam); Michael Lapidge (1977), \"The Authorship of the Adonic Verse 'Ad Fidolium' Attributed to Columbanus,\" Studi Medievali, series 3, 18:2, 249\u2013314; Peter Jacobsen (1982), \"Carmina Columbani,\" Die Iren und Europa im f\u00fchren Mittelalter, Heinz L\u00f6we, ed.

The Planctus appeared in a seventeenth-century manuscript compilation of the poems of Hrabanus Maurus under the subscription \"Hymnus Columbani ad Andream episcopum de obitu Caroli\", which inspired L. A. Muratori to make the identification, but this late ascription to a Columbanus is probably deduced from the poem's own seventeenth stanza. As argued by Heinz L\u00f6we, that stanza in fact makes it very difficult to argue that the poet, who consistently uses the first person, was the Columbanus he refers to.L\u00f6we and his objection are sustained by Michael Herren (2000), \"Some Quantitative Poems Attributed to Columbanus of Bobbio,\" Poetry and Philosophy in the Middle Ages: A Festschrift for Peter Dronke, John Marenbon, ed.
