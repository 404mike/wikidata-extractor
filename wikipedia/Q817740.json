A document entitled The Principles of Open Brethren stated: \"Certain tracts issued by Mr. Newton were judged to contain error regarding the nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the question arose whether it was sufficient to exclude from the fellowship those who held the erroneous teaching, or whether all who belonged to a gathering where the error was tolerated were to be put outside the pale, even if they themselves had not embraced it. One party, led by Mr Darby, took the latter view. Others, in particular the Bethesda Church, in which Messrs M\u00fcller and Craik ministered, refused to admit any who were convicted of holding the evil doctrine themselves but did not exclude those who came from Mr Newton's meeting. The exclusive party thereupon declined to have any further fellowship with members of the Bethesda Church or others like-minded. The latter soon came to receive the title of 'Open Brethren'.\"Harding, p 123-4 The more exclusive side of the brethren movement became known as the Exclusive Brethren and was led by Darby. Darby called on M\u00fcller in July 1849 to discuss the split, but M\u00fcller had many prior engagements and could only receive Darby for 10 minutes.

In response, Isabella and Mary Campbell of the parish of Rosneath manifested charismatic experiences such as speaking in tongues. Around 1830, miraculous healings were reported through James Campbell, first of his sister Margaret MacDonald and then of Mary Campbell (through James's letter to Mary). Shortly thereafter, James and George MacDonald manifested the speaking and interpretations of tongues, and soon others followed suit in prayer meetings. These charismatic experiences garnered major national attention. Many came to see and investigate these events. Some, such as Edward Irving and Henry Drummond, regarded these events as genuine displays from the Holy Spirit.

With mentoring from Evans, he became involved with the ministry of the John Street Chapel, giving sermons and helping with the poor in the surrounding area.  In 1831 he was asked by his cousin, Thomas Pugsley (1794-1834), to preach at a workhouse in Devon.  This led to an invitation to become the pastor in a Particular Baptist chapel in Barnstable.   He was unable to reconcile differences within the congregation and in about 1834 a split occurred.  Chapman became the pastor of the Open Brethren in Barnstable, locating eventually to a chapel in Bear Street.
