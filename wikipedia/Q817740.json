His congregation and others around Plymouth became known as the Plymouth Brethren. Newton was a friend of John Nelson Darby, a well-known leader of the Plymouth Brethren, but the two men began to clash on matters of church doctrine and practice. This led to a 1848 split of the movement into the Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
