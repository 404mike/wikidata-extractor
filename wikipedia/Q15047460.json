This last he twice transcribed (the first transcript was destroyed by a fire at James Perry's house) from the original among the Gale manuscripts in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was pleased when he found how often in Aristophanes he had been anticipated by Bentley, and when Niels Iversen Schow's collation of the unique manuscripts of Hesychius appeared and proved him right in some instances.", "Among his intimate friends was James Perry, editor of the Morning Chronicle. He married Perry's sister, Mrs Lunan, in November 1796. Porson then drank less; but she died a few months after her marriage (12 April 1797), and he returned to his chambers in the Temple and his old habits. Perry's friendship induced him to spend his time in writing for the Morning Chronicle."]}, {"page": "John Soane", "response": ["Soane counted many members of the Royal Academy as friends, including J. M. W. Turner, with whom he spent the Christmas after his wife's death; Soane also owned three works by the artist. John Flaxman, professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy, was an old friend and Soane also acquired several plaster-casts of Flaxman's work for his museum.  Soane also counted Thomas Banks as a friend (and owned sculptures by him), and Thomas Lawrence, who painted Soane's portrait. Despite the professional falling-out with his old master, George Dance the Younger, they remained firm friends. After Dance's death Soane purchased his drawings. After the death of his other teacher, Henry Holland, Soane tried to buy his drawings and papers, but found they had been destroyed; he did however purchase some of his antique sculptures.Stroud, 1966, p. 152 Despite being professional rivals, Soane got on with fellow architect John Nash; they often dined together.Darley, 1999, p. 292 Soane called on William Thomas Beckford both in London and when he was taking the waters in Bath in 1829. Soane had other friends including James Perry, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, Barbara HoflandWaterfield, p. 45 and Rowland Burdon, whose friendship was formed while on the Grand Tour."]}, {"page": "John Crawfurd", "response": ["Crawfurd married Horatia Ann, daughter of James Perry.

Circulation increased, and by 1810, the typical sale was 7,000 copies. The content often came from journalists labelled as radicals, a dangerous connotation in the aftermath of the French Revolution.", "Perry was succeeded by John Black, probably in 1817 when Perry developed a severe illness. It was Black who later employed Dickens, Mayhew, and John Stuart Mill. William Innel(l) Clement (the owner of several titles) purchased the Morning Chronicle on the death of James Perry in 1821 for \u00a342,000, raising most of the purchase money by bills. The transaction involved him with Messrs. Hurst & Robinson, the publishers, and their bankruptcy in 1825 hit him very hard.

Persuaded by Mudford to join him in London, Black traveled there with a letter of introduction to Robert Cromek, who welcomed him into his home. Within three months of his arrival, Black found employment as a reporter and translator for James Perry. In December 1812 he married Elizabeth Frances 'Fanny' Cropley, the mistress of a London friend William Fisher; the union was short and loveless, and she plagued Black financially for years afterward. John Black did have a son Charles William Black 1813-1876 by Fanny, but soon after the marriage failed, he began a long-lasting common-law relationship with Anne Cromek."]}, {"page": "Tavistock House", "response": ["Tavistock House was built by builder and developer James Burton, who probably lived in Tavistock House while he developed the surrounding area.  From Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, Burton acquired the leases for two plots of land, one northern and one southern, on the east side of Tavistock Square. It was on the northern plot, and part of the southern plot, that Burton built Tavistock House. Burton sold the lease for Tavistock House to Thomas Murdock in 1805. Murdock lived there for six years before he in turn sold the lease to Benjamin Oakley in 1811. In 1812 Oakley transferred the lease to journalist James Perry, who was the first editor of The European Magazine, and who also edited the Morning Chronicle. The house is shown on Davies' Map of Marylebone, printed in 1834. ", "Stockbroker Charles Williams later lived in Tavistock House, renting it from his friend James Perry. From Tavistock House Williams published a volume of private letters and portraits of his family. In his will Perry left the house to his nephew Thomas Bentley, from whom it was later purchased by auctioneer George Henry Robins of Covent Garden, who probably divided it into three separate residences.", "* James Perry, journalist"]}, {"page": "Pryse Lockhart Gordon", "response": ["In 1823 Gordon wrote a guide for travellers, entitled A Companion to Italy, the success of which led to the appearance of his Personal Memoirs in 1830. This contained reminiscences of notable persons known to the author, including Lady Hamilton, George Brydges Rodney, Richard Porson, Charles Burney, and James Perry of the Morning Chronicle. It sketches picture and antiquity hunting, at a time when bargains were to be had, and connoisseurs were liable to be imposed upon. Gordon himself obtained for Burney the copy of Constantine Lascaris's Grammar, the first Greek book printed, which went to the British Museum. There is a description of the English at Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo. His reminiscences of Rodney asserted that Rodney, upon his return to England, volunteered to Gordon an acknowledgement of his acquaintance with Clerk of Eldin's essay on naval tactics, and his indebtedness to it. In 1834 Gordon published Holland and Belgium, with notes on the Belgian Revolution and its causes."]}, {"page": "Joseph Booth (actor)", "response": ["In 1774, when he recruited Thomas Holcroft to his company at Carlisle, Booth was a provincial theatrical manager in the north of England. The position was a temporary one, the company manager West Digges being absent. The company contained other well-known names: Elizabeth Inchbald, James Perry, William Shield. A business proposition concerned with making reproductions of paintings, by a process kept secret, was something Booth discussed with Holcroft around 1780; at this period he was an assistant prompter at Covent Garden Theatre. He also claimed an invention relating to textile manufacture.Hazlitt, p. 88.Hazlitt, p. 117.", "James Perry made an effort to continue the \"polygraphic art\" south-west of London; Pryse Gordon in 1830 decried Booth as a charlatan, and told of Booth's textile scheme in connection with Perry and his colleague James Gray. Richard Alfred Davenport writing in 1837, rather dismissively, mentioned that at least eight exhibitions were held, and suggested that the process used multiple blocks, an innovation that had been tried again recently. In the 1860s the works of the Polygraphic Society were brought up in a debate on the priority for photography."]}, {"page": "1756 in Scotland", "response": ["* 30 October \u2013 James Perry, born Pirie, journalist (died 1821 in England)"]}]}}
