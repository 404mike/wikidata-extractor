She began her career in the field of commercial photography but soon started her own agency which specialised in family portraits, and wedding photos. In the 1970s, she refocused her work towards documentary photography, adopting a politicized approach to her art form, with socialist and feminist themes revisited throughout her career. Self-portraits about her own fight with breast cancer, depicting various stages of her breast cancer to subvert the notion of an idealized female form, inspired projects in 'photo therapy', a means of using the medium to work on psychological health.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1875\u20131939||data-sort-value=\"Spence, Jo\"|Jo Spence||United Kingdom||1934||1992||||"]}, {"page": "Murray Edwards College, Cambridge", "response": ["* Jo Spence"]}, {"page": "Dog Man Star", "response": ["*Jo Spence and Terry Dennett \u2013 additional photography"]}, {"page": "List of breast cancer patients by survival status", "response": ["*Jo Spence, British photographer (died at age 58)"]}, {"page": "My Bed", "response": ["Art world predecessors to Emin's personal disclosure work include artists Carolee Schneemann, Sue Williams, Karen Finley, Jo Spence, and David Wojnarowicz."]}, {"page": "List of people with breast cancer", "response": ["| Jo Spence"]}, {"page": "Decima Gallery", "response": ["*1999: 8 June: The Leeds 13 Degree Show - Decima exhibited as an \"artist\" in this show in Leeds, doing a \"Diana the Dancing Cow\" performance alongside Bank, Barbara Hepworth, The Chapman Brothers, Damien Hirst, Georgina Starr, Jeff Koons, Jo Spence, Kurt Schwitters, Marcel Duchamp and Sam Taylor-Wood among others."]}, {"page": "Joseph Spence", "response": ["*Jo Spence (1934\u20131992), British photographer"]}, {"page": "Graham Smith (photographer)", "response": ["*Three Perspectives on Photography: Recent British Photography.

A woman designer and an illustrator, a writer and an editor also joined the group.
