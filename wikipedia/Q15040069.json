He is the son-in-law of the multiple champion jockey Lester Piggott.\nHe was educated at Harrow and played cricket at Lord's for Harrow against Eton in 1977, 1978 and 1979, captaining the side in the 1979 match.  He started his working life in his father's textile factory, but quit after three months and headed to Newmarket.  Before taking out a licence in his own right, he learnt his trade with John Winter and Mark Prescott.  He trained his first winner in 1987.  As of June 2013, he has trained two British Classic winners \u2013 Shaamit, winner of the 1996 Derby, and Dancing Rain, winner of the 2011 Oaks.  The first of these came when he had just 40 horses in his stable.  The second gave him the distinction of having two wins from his first two runners in the Epsom Classics.  His third, Vow,  came fourth in the 2012 Oaks.  Largely thanks to the exploits of Dancing Rain, he finished joint 7th in the 2011 British Champions Series trainers' table.\nIn early 2013 he was appointed to the roster of Royal trainers. He trained his first winner for the Queen (Elizabeth II), when Purple Spectrum won a maiden race at Windsor on 12 May 2014.\nOther top-level horses he has trained include Chorist, Aqlaam and King's Apostle.  He has also trained winners of the German 2,000 Guineas, Topkapi Trophy and Hong Kong Derby.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Epsom Derby", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Epsom Oaks", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Eclipse Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire Oaks", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Queen Elizabeth II Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Cheveley Park Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Champion Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Vertem Futurity Trophy", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Sandown Mile", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Duke of York Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Ribblesdale Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "King Edward VII Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Richmond Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Great Voltigeur Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Gimcrack Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas", "| William Haggas", "| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Lowther Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas", "| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Flying Childers Stakes", "response": ["| William Haggas"]}, {"page": "Lester Piggott", "response": ["Piggott is married to Susan Armstrong.
