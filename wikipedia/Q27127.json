High-voltage AC transmission allowed hydroelectric power to be conveniently moved from distant waterfalls to city markets. The advent of the steam turbine in central station service, around 1906, allowed great expansion of generating capacity. Generators were no longer limited by the power transmission of belts or the relatively slow speed of reciprocating engines, and could grow to enormous sizes. For example, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti planned what would have reciprocating steam engine ever built for a proposed new central station, but scrapped the plans when turbines became available in the necessary size. Building power systems out of central stations required combinations of engineering skill and financial acumen in equal measure. Pioneers of central station generation include George Westinghouse and Samuel Insull in the United States, Ferranti and Charles Hesterman Merz in UK, and many others."]}, {"page": "Railways in Melbourne", "response": ["Planning for electrification was started by Victorian Railways chairman Thomas James Tait, who engaged English engineer Charles Hesterman Merz to deliver a report on the electrification of the Melbourne suburban network. His first report in 1908 recommended a three-stage plan over 2 years, covering 200 route km of existing lines and almost 500 suburban carriages (approximately 80 trains). The report was considered by the Government and the Railway Commissioners, and Merz was engaged to deliver a second report based on their feedback."]}, {"page": "Merz (surname)", "response": ["* Charles Hesterman Merz (1874\u20131940), Pioneer of the National Grid UK"]}, {"page": "Switchgear", "response": ["Differential protection depends upon Kirchhoff's current law, which states that the sum of currents entering or leaving a circuit node must equal zero.  Using this principle to implement differential protection, any section of a conductive path may be considered a node.  The conductive path could be a transmission line, a winding of a transformer, a winding in a motor, or a winding in the stator of an alternator.  This form of protection works best when both ends of the conductive path are physically close to each other.  This scheme was invented  in Great Britain by Charles Hesterman Merz and Bernard Price."]}, {"page": "List of Quaker businesses, organizations and charities", "response": ["* Merz & McLellan, British electrical engineering consultancy co-founded by Charles Hesterman Merz"]}, {"page": "Alexander Gibb", "response": ["Gibb founded his own firm, Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, in 1922 after becoming a consulting engineer the year before. He was involved in a variety of projects worldwide, including Barking Power Station, the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme (both with Charles Hesterman Merz and William McLellan), the Kincardine Bridge,Juliet Barnes  a study at the port of Rangoon and work at the Singapore Naval Base. In the 1930s the firm gained work in the industrial sector, including the Park Royal Guinness brewery. This led their engagement in 1939 to undertake the design and supervision of three ordnance factories for the Ministry of Supply, work which would continue throughout the Second World War."]}, {"page": "Charles Merz", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Hesterman Merz"]}, {"page": "North Eastern Electric Supply Company", "response": ["NESCo opened its first power station, Pandon Dene, in 1890. Merz's son, Charles Hesterman Merz worked at the Pandon Dene station and became the company's Chief Consultant Engineer. Charles Merz's design company, Merz & McLellan, which he founded with William McLellan, undertook much of NESCo's design work from 1898 onward. They designed the pioneering Neptune Bank Power Station, which opened in 1901. It was the first power station in the United Kingdom to generate three-phase electric power, and the first to supply electricity for industrial purposes rather than just lighting. This led to the rapid expansion of NESCo, and gave the Tyneside industries an advantage over those in other areas. For the 30 years following the opening of the Neptune Bank station, NESCo became one of the World's leading companies in power station development."]}, {"page": "John Theodore Merz", "response": ["His son, Charles Hesterman Merz, was a successful electrical engineer who pioneered the use of high-voltage three-phase AC power distribution in the United Kingdom."]}, {"page": "Henry William Clothier", "response": ["In 1905 Clothier went to Tyneside to work with Charles Hesterman Merz and Bernard Price and joined Mr Alphonse C. Reyrolle at A. Reyrolle & Company in 1906, and remained employed with them for the rest of his life. In Tyneside he began an investigation of protective gear for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution at the instigation of Charles Merz and Bernard Price. While thus engaged his attention was directed to improvement of high-voltage switchgear. At the time, switchgear was prone to catching fire, making switchrooms a dangerous place to work. It was largely due to Clothier's work and initiative that both the Merz-Price protective-gear and the metal-clad switchgear, which controlled arcing on open-type electric switchboards, became not only technically but commercially practicable.
