Bob Heath was in his own words \"product of the New Left\", and had indeed been asked to become editor of the Universities and Left Review, a mouthpiece for the New Left, in 1956. In the late-1950s, Harry Barnes had himself been inspired to join the Labour Party by the teachings of left-wing intellectual G.D.H. Cole, who had also inspired Stuart Hall and other New Left undergraduates in Oxford in the mid-1950s. It is also notable that the New Left's critique of both Western and Soviet foreign policy, and its calls for an independent British foreign policy, had much traction amongst SocSoc members. The Society also operated a decentralised, facilitative structure instead of a top-down, insular executive - something of a key ideal of the New Left, and especially of the student movements that followed in the late-1950s.", "The 1960s was something of a golden age for left-wing politics in Hull. Various factors - the strong city Labour Party; the influence of left-wing lecturers such as John Saville, Tony Topham, Axel Stern and Janet Blackman; and Hull University's links with Ruskin College, an institution for the education of (generally left-wing) working class adults at Oxford, which provided many students to fill SocSoc's ranks, such as future MPs John Prescott and Harry Barnes, and Bob Heath, SocSoc chair from 1962 to 1965 - gave Hull University a reputation in the press and amongst staff and students as the \"reddest of the red bricks.\" Many left-wing prospective students minded to attend an institution which offered them opportunities for political activism, as well as the chance to pursue academia, were attracted to Hull University to study.", "* Harry Barnes (North East Derbyshire, 1987\u20132005)"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Harry Barnes, North East Derbyshire, 1987\u20132005"]}, {"page": "Harry Barnes", "response": ["Harry Barnes may refer to:", "* Harry Barnes (baseball) (1915\u20131993), American Negro league baseball player", "* Harry Barnes (basketball) (born 1945), American basketball player", "* Harry Barnes (footballer) (1903\u20132001), Australian rules footballer", "* Harry Barnes (Labour politician) (born 1936), British Labour Party MP for North East Derbyshire, 1987\u20132005", "* Harry Barnes (Liberal politician) (1870\u20131935), British Liberal Party MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East, 1918\u20131922"]}, {"page": "1994 Labour Party deputy leadership election", "response": ["| Harry Barnes || Margaret Beckett || Margaret Beckett"]}, {"page": "Dronfield Henry Fanshawe School", "response": ["Dronfield Grammar School, later renamed the Henry Fanshawe School, was founded in 1578, by the will of Henry Fanshawe, whose wish it was for his nephew, Thomas Fanshawe, to establish the school.

The Henry Fanshawe School and The Gosforth School merged in 1990 to form The Dronfield School (a two site school) with the closure of the Gladys Buxton School, and this then became the Dronfield Henry Fanshawe School in 2004, a single site school, with the closure of the Gosforth site. At present, the Gladys Buxton site remains disused for public schooling use, yet is retained as a reserve should numbers rise, or alternative teaching space be needed. The Gosforth site (formerly the Gosforth School) was demolished in 2005, and Derbyshire County Council have used the extensive fields for a sports development. The Dronfield Henry Fanshawe School was officially opened on 28 January 1991 by Harry Barnes, then Labour MP for North East Derbyshire.
