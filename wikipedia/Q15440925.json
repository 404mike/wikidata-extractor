Davies (1945\u20132018) was a British biblical scholar. He was Professor Emeritus of biblical studies at the University of Sheffield, England. In the late 1990s, he was the Director for the Centre for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls. He was also the publisher and editorial director of Sheffield Academic Press. He was the author of books and articles on ancient Israelite history and religion, including Scribes and Schools (1998) in the Library of Ancient Israel. Davies promoted the theory of cultural memory. He and David Clines are known for editing the Journal for the Study of the Old Testament and its Supplement Series. Davies is closely associated with the movement known as The Copenhagen School dubbed biblical minimalism by detractors (other figures include Niels Peter Lemche, Keith Whitelam, and Thomas L. Thompson), a loosely knit group of scholars who hold that the Bible's version of history is not supported by any archaeological evidence so far unearthed, indeed undermined by it, and that it therefore cannot be trusted as history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Resurrection", "response": ["During the Second Temple period, there developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection.Cf.
