He represented Wales at Under-21 level.\nThomas began his career as a trainee with Blackburn Rovers, turning professional in August 1997. He struggled to establish himself at Ewood Park and was loaned to a number of clubs before being released at the end of the 2001\u201302 season. A highlight of his loan spells was when he scored the winning goal for Sheffield United against Preston North End, helping them win 3-2 when they had at one stage trailed 2\u20130. Another loan spell at Bristol Rovers yielded one goal against Rochdale. He scored three goals during his time at Blackburn; once in the league against Bolton Wanderers and twice in a League Cup tie against Portsmouth.In May 2002 he joined Swansea City and quickly established himself in the first team. He is fondly remembered for the hat-trick he scored in a 4\u20132 victory over Hull on the last day of the 2002\u201303 season to save his hometown club from relegation to the Football Conference. With Swansea he became Wales' most capped player at Under-21 level and was called up to the full squad for the match away to Azerbaijan in November 2002, but did not get to play.\nThomas later suffered a knee injury that kept him out of the game for two years. He joined Llanelli in August 2006. After a short time playing in Australia, he returned to Wales where he now works as an ambulance driver.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trinidad and Tobago Football Association", "response": ["| James Thomas"]}, {"page": "Morriston", "response": ["*James Thomas, former Swansea City A.F.C. and Welsh U21 football international"]}, {"page": "James Thomas", "response": ["James Thomas may refer to:", "* James Thomas (Australian politician) (1826\u20131884), civil engineer who was Director of Public Works in Western Australia, 1876\u20131884", "* James Thomas (Governor of Maryland) (1785\u20131845), served as the 23rd Governor of the state of Maryland", "* James Thomas (Swansea) (1710\u20131781), Alderman and Portreeve of Swansea", "* James Thomas, 1st Viscount Cilcennin (1903\u20131960), Conservative politician in the UK, and former First Lord of the Admiralty", "* James Thomas (musician) (born 1963), Director of Music of St Edmundsbury Cathedral", "* James Thomas (blues musician) (1926\u20131993), American Delta blues musician", "* James Thomas (basketball) (born 1980), American professional basketball player", "* James Thomas (footballer) (born 1979), Welsh professional footballer", "* James Thomas (rugby union) (born 1990), Welsh rugby union player", "* James Thomas (professor), professor at the University of Utah", "* James Thomas (priest), Dean of Saint Paul's Cathedral, Wellington"]}, {"page": "Shaun MacDonald", "response": ["MacDonald has represented his country at under-19 and Under-21 levels.
