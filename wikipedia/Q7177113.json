As an enemy alien living in London in the late 1930s, Hein assumed the identity of a dead schoolfriend in order to join the RAF at the outbreak of hostilities.\nShot down on a bombing raid, he was captured by the Germans and held a prisoner of war.  Aware that if his true identity was discovered he would be regarded as a traitor he made repeated escape attempts, but was always recaptured.  Liberated from the POW camp at the end of the war, he finally obtained British citizenship.  In 1947 he transferred to MI6's East German section, retaining his RAF commission.  After leaving MI6 he emigrated to Canada in 1952, embarking on a business career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Canadian Jews", "response": ["* Peter Stevens (RAF officer) (1919\u20131979), German born WWII RAF officer, and RCAF post-war, best known for multiple POW escapes"]}, {"page": "List of British Jews", "response": ["* Peter Stevens, World War II bomber pilot/POW and recipient of the Military Cross for numerous escape activities; a German-Jewish refugee living in London at the outbreak of hostilities; born Georg Franz HEIN in Hanover; committed identity theft in order to join the RAF; was naturalized a British citizen in 1946"]}, {"page": "Stalag Luft III", "response": ["* Peter Stevens (RAF officer), the only known German-Jewish bomber pilot in the Royal Air Force.

The sentry was not satisfied with their gate pass, so Stevens marched his party back into the camp. As the sentry was apparently unaware that the party was not genuine, a second attempt was made a week later.

This was the first immediate blow to Bruce's and Tunstall's first escape plan. The second blow occurred when the escape committee decided to adjust the plan as they wanted it to accommodate more prisoners. The committee's new plan was to use the uniforms and the forged papers and then march out a big, bogus, working party. Bruce and Tunstall were to be orderlies in the plan and the uniforms were to be worn by two fluent German speakers. One of the guards was called Peter Stevens MC who was a fluent German speaker; and the other guard of the orderlies was called Lance Pope who also spoke good German. Tunstall explains how he and Bruce accepted the change selflessly but were worried that the changes were too ambitious and would complicate things.
