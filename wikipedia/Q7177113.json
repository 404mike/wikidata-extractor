As an enemy alien living in London in the late 1930s, Hein assumed the identity of a dead schoolfriend in order to join the RAF at the outbreak of hostilities.\nShot down on a bombing raid, he was captured by the Germans and held a prisoner of war.  Aware that if his true identity was discovered he would be regarded as a traitor he made repeated escape attempts, but was always recaptured.  Liberated from the POW camp at the end of the war, he finally obtained British citizenship.  In 1947 he transferred to MI6's East German section, retaining his RAF commission.  After leaving MI6 he emigrated to Canada in 1952, embarking on a business career.", "link_mentions": {}}}
