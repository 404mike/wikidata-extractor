In 1780, a new edition of the Poems, comprising a third and posthumous volume of Miscellanies, was published by Dr. Caleb Evans, the profits of which were to be given to the \"Bristol Education Society\", also known as the Baptist College of Bristol, of which he was at that time President; to that volume, the Editor prefixed a biography of \"Mrs. Steele\", as she was more commonly called.", "Steele's hymns, which were much used by Baptists, emphasized the less optimistic phases of Christian experience. Among Baptist hymnwriters, Steele stood at the head, if regarded either by the number of her hymns which found a place in the hymnals of the nineteenth century, or the frequency with which they were sung. Although few of them could be placed in the first rank of lyrical compositions, they were almost uniformly simple in language, natural and pleasing in imagery, and full of genuine Christian feeling. Steele may not inappropriately be compared with Frances Ridley Havergal. In both, there was the same evangelic fervour, in both the same intense personal devotion to Jesus. But whilst Steele seemed to think of Him more frequently as her \"bleeding, dying Lord\"\u2014dwelling on His sufferings in their physical aspect, Havergal more often referred to His living help and sympathy, recognized with gladness His present claims as \"Master\" and \"King,\" and anticipated almost with ecstasy His second coming. Looking at the whole of Steele's hymns, there is a wider range of thought than in Miss Havergal's compositions.

The children had a peaceful upbringing despite the fact that their parents' relationship was often strained. In 1902, the family moved to Inkberrow near Redditch, then to Paris where the Rev. Mr. Havergal was assistant chaplain to the British embassy for two years. Then, after a brief period spent at Bagthorpe in , he became rector of Brent Eleigh in Norfolk. Havergal, together with her elder sister Frances, attended St Katherine's boarding school in Walmer after 1912, but after her parents divorced in 1914, she and her siblings moved with their mother to Bedford, where they lived at number 13 Sidney Road, and the children attended Bedford High School. Havergal began working in horticulture after leaving school in 1916, taking on local gardening jobs under the auspices of the Women's War Agricultural Committee. Soon after, her father rejoined the family, and their finances improved sufficiently to allow Havergal to consider training. She ultimately chose to pursue horticulture over music. She subsequently attended the Thatcham Fruit and Flower Farm near Newbury, wherefrom she graduated in 1920, obtaining the Royal Horticultural Society's certificate with honours. Her first challenge was to design and create a garden at Cold Ash, where the high quality of her work brought her to the attention of Miss Willis, the headmistress of the nearby Downe House boarding school. Willis invited Havergal to become the school's head gardener, an offer which she accepted. She created six tennis courts at Downe House, which later became known as the Havergal Courts."]}, {"page": "Charlotte Alington Barnard", "response": ["* Frances Ridley Havergal"]}, {"page": "Ada R.
