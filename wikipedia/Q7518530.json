The organisation also carries out environmental activist and educational roles. Wildlife Aid has attracted media attention for its rescues of photogenic wild animals like young foxes and baby badgers; Animal Planet's TV program Wildlife SOS chronicles the activities of Wildlife Aid volunteers as they rescue imperiled animals.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "City of London Freemen's School", "response": ["* Simon Cowell (presenter) - MBE, presenter of Animal Planet and Wildlife SOS"]}, {"page": "Cowell (surname)", "response": ["* Two people named Simon Cowell:", "** Simon Cowell (born 1959), British record producer and impresario, known for Britain's Got Talent and other shows", "** Simon Cowell, British television presenter, host of Wildlife SOS "]}, {"page": "Gary Hodges", "response": ["In 2004 and 2005 Hodges created three new drawings linked to charity.

Other artist contributors included Damian Hurst, Quentin Blake, and Dame Elizabeth Blackadder.\"Drawn to the Soul\" Wild Press, Queen of Diamonds 2004, 2010,  The Born Free Foundation contacted Hodges in the autumn of 2004 asking him to draw Elsa the lioness to celebrate their 21st anniversary as a charity. The Spirit of Elsa (2005) was the result, drawn from old grainy photographs of Elsa, a lioness which had died when Hodges was a child. He states that he listened to Matt Monro's version of the theme tune of \"Born Free\" playing in the background on repeat, sometimes changing it to Kiki Dee's acoustic version. He believes the drawing has \"a touch of innocent, child-like quality to it.\" This was Hodges' first drawing he reproduced on canvas as well as paper.Gary Hodges Wildlife Art official website, Spirit of Elsa 2005, "]}]}}
