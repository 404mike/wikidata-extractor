Some were Owl Stretching Time, The Toad Elevating Moment, A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket, Vaseline Review, and Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot. Flying Circus stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it. Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went (popular legend holds that the BBC considered Monty Python's Flying Circus to be a ridiculous name, at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented). Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show. Baron Von Took's Flying Circus was considered as an affectionate tribute to Barry Took, the man who had brought them together. Arthur Megapode's Flying Circus was suggested, then discarded. The name Baron Von Took's Flying Circus had the form of Baron Manfred von Richthofen's Flying Circus of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the Royal Guardsmen's 1966 song \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\" had peaked. The term 'flying circus' was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as barnstorming, where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts."]}, {"page": "March 31", "response": ["*2002 \u2013 Barry Took, English comedian, actor, and screenwriter (b. 1928)"]}, {"page": "Kenneth Williams", "response": ["Kenneth Charles Williams was born on 22 February 1926 in Bingfield Street, Kings Cross, London.GRO Register of Births: March 1926 1b 408 Islington \u2013 Kenneth C.

However, the producer of the sketch did not like them and viewed the characters as \"too sad\" and suggested making them younger \"chorus boy\" types. Their first appearance was in episode four of the first series, and \u2013 although Marty Feldman apparently \"got tired of them\" \u2013 Julian and Sandy proved to be the most successful part of the show, and appeared in every episode thereafter.", "Ad-libs were a prominent part of the sketch (although on 'That Reminds Me', Barry Took denied this, saying that most of what seemed to be ad lib was scripted), and were one of the reasons for how well the humour worked, as both Paddick and Williams were accomplished and very familiar with Polari in real life conversation. Williams, in particular, would add many lines of his own (\"Lau your luppers on the strillers bona\" (play the piano) being his most extreme use of obscure Polari).", "Another catchphrase often used by both characters was \"That's your actual French\", although Barry Took acknowledged that Peter Cook had claimed to be the first to use \"your actual ....\" as a format phrase."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Horne", "response": ["In January 1957 Horne appeared as the compere on the popular Saturday evening comedy and music radio show Variety Playhouse, initially for a run of four months, but soon extended until the end of June. He also began to write a weekly column for the women's magazine She, and to appear in an increasing number of other programmes. After his work on Variety Playhouse had finished, he and the programme's writers Eric Merriman and Barry Took prepared a script for a pilot episode of a new show, Beyond Our Ken. The show, in which Horne was joined by Kenneth Williams, Ron Moody, Hugh Paddick and Betty Marsden, was broadcast in October 1957.", "The seventh series of Beyond Our Ken finished in February 1964, with an average audience of ten million listeners per programme. In September that year Horne returned from holiday and was scheduled to appear in a number of programmes; Eric Merriman objected to Horne's activities, saying that Horne had been made into a star by the writer, and that \"no other comedy series should be allowed to use him\". When the BBC refused to withdraw Horne from the second programme, Down with Women, Merriman resigned from writing Beyond Our Ken and the show came to an end. After some pressure from Horne to keep the remainder of the team together, the BBC commissioned a replacement series, Round the Horne, on similar lines. They turned to one of the original writers of Beyond Our Ken, Barry Took and his new writing partner, Marty Feldman. Horne remained the genial and unflappable focal figure, and the writers invented several new and eccentric characters to revolve round him. They included J. Peasemold Gruntfuttock, the walking slum; the No\u00ebl Coward parodies Charles and Fiona; the incompetent villain Dr. Chou En Ginsberg; the folk singer Rambling Syd Rumpo and the \"outrageously camp\" Julian and Sandy. The resulting programme was described by radio historians Andy Foster and Steve Furst as \"one of the seminal comedies to come out of the BBC\", while The Spectator described it as \"one of the great radio successes\". The first series of Round the Horne, consisting of 16 episodes, ran from March to June 1965. Horne's role was to provide \"the perfect foil to the inspired lunacy happening all around him\":", "Round the Horne ran to four series, broadcast in successive years, and finished in June 1968. Three weeks after the fourth series finished, the first episode of Horne A'Plenty was broadcast on ITV. In a sketch show format, and with Barry Took as script editor (and later producer), this was an attempt to translate the spirit of Round the Horne to television, although with different actors supporting Horne: Graham Stark, for example, substituted for Kenneth Williams and Sheila Steafel for Betty Marsden. The first six-part series ran from 22 June to 27 July 1968, the second (by which time ABC had become Thames Television) from 27 November to 1 January 1969.", "Because of his heart condition, Horne had been prescribed an anticoagulant, but had stopped taking it on the advice of a faith healer. Horne died of a heart attack on 14 February 1969, while hosting the annual Guild of Television Producers' and Directors' Awards at the Dorchester hotel in London. Presenting the awards was Earl Mountbatten of Burma; an award had gone to Barry Took and Marty Feldman for their TV series Marty, and Horne had just urged viewers to tune into the fifth series of Round the Horne (which was due to start on 16 March) when he fell from the podium. The televised recording of the event omitted the incident, with announcer Michael Aspel explaining, \"Mr Horne was taken ill at this point and has since died.\" A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields in March that year.", "After his death, Horne was eulogised in The Times as \"a master of the scandalous double-meaning delivered with shining innocence\", while The Sunday Mirror called him \"one of the few personalities who bridged the generation gap\" and \"perhaps the last of the truly great radio comics.\" In the December 1970 issue of The Listener, Barry Took recalled Round the Horne and said of its star:", "Horne's friend, Barry Took, considered that \"Horne's rich, fruity voice and warm patrician manner made him the ideal link man and that, coupled with a mischievous sense of humour, ensured that any programme in which he was involved was the better for his presence\". Horne attributed his voice and delivery \"to 'the Grace of God', his grandfather Lord Cozens-Hardy, the former Master of the Rolls, and the hard training of being 'a jovial chap among the golf and motoring fraternity'.\"", "A successful stage show called Round the Horne\u00a0... Revisited opened in London in October 2003, compiled by Series Four co-writer Brian Cooke from original scripts. It ran until April 2005, and also generated three nationwide tours and a BBC television film. On 27 February 2007 (Horne's centenary), BBC Radio 4 broadcast a half-hour documentary tribute entitled Sound the Horne, hosted by Jimmy Carr. The following year, on 18 September, another Radio 4 documentary was broadcast; called Thoroughly Modest Mollie, this focused on Horne's frequent ghost-writer, Mollie Millest. A new show, devised by Barry Took's widow Lyn, called Round the Horne \u2013 Unseen and Uncut, toured in 2008 and 2009. In 2009 an unbroadcast pilot script written by Horne and Millest in 1966 was produced by the same Radio 4 team.

Round the Horne helped change the way the BBC dealt with broadcasting humour: \"The ebullience of the\u00a0... comedy \u2013 not to mention the filth of the innuendos \u2013 swept away decades of insipid and paternalistic inhibition at the BBC\", according to Richard Morrison, the chief arts correspondent of The Times.", "In 2008 Barry Took's former wife, Lyn, and the director Richard Baron prepared a new stage adaptation, Round the Horne \u2013 Unseen and Uncut, which drew entirely on Took and Feldman material from series one to three.

For this, Rambling Syd was customarily introduced by Kenneth Horne, who would set things up by (for example) inquiring as to the nature and origin of the song. Rambling Syd would (usually) respond with an \"Ello, me dearios\", before launching into the ensuing detailed explanation which left a great deal to the imagination. The songs themselves pushed and extended boundaries of sexual suggestiveness, using nonsense (or little-known) words such as 'moolies' and 'nadgers' in suggestive contexts.'Nadgers' is one of many words with sexual innuendo which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s to evade strict BBC censorship. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly based on 'gonad'. When Rambling Syd Rumpo on Round the Horne asked \"What shall we do with the drunken nurker?\", the answer he gave was \"Hit him in the 'nadgers' with the bosun's plunger...'til his 'bogles' dangle\". Many of the words used by Rambling Syd were invented by the Round the Horne scriptwriters Barry Took and Marty Feldman, who wrote the majority of the songs' lyrics, based upon traditional folk songs.
