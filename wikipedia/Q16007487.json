He was born at Whitwick, Leicestershire and died at Leicester.\nSharp played as a right-handed middle-order batsman; as an amateur, he acted as captain of Leicestershire many times over his long career, and was official captain in 1921 and for part of 1922. A solicitor, Sharp never played a full season, but he appeared in first-class matches in every season from 1908 to 1935 with the exception of 1925. Most of his first-class cricket was concentrated into the years either side of the First World War: from 1926 onwards, he played in most years just one or two matches and he passed 50 only once in the 10 seasons before his very last appearance in 1935.Sharp was educated at Repton School where he was in 1908 a member of a cricket team that was rated by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as the best school side for many years: that season, Sharp made his debut for Leicestershire, and his school team-mates Harry Altham, Richard Sale and Bill Greswell also played county cricket after the school term ended. Sharp made little impact in his early seasons and even in 1910, when he played in 15 games, a season's total that he never exceeded, he made only 414 runs at an average of 18.00, with two scores of more than 50.In 1911, he played what Wisden termed \"the innings of his life\" by scoring 216 in the match against Derbyshire at Chesterfield; it did indeed prove to be the highest of his first-class career. He made his first 50 runs in 105 minutes, but then raced to 216 in 250 minutes, scoring two fives and 37 fours and putting on 262 for the sixth wicket with Gustavus Fowke, which remained the Leicestershire record for this wicket until beaten by Phil Simmons and Paul Nixon in 1996. Despite this achievement, Wisden noted that \"in fourteen more attempts he scored only about 150 runs, so that his one big performance must be taken as promise rather than a proof of first-rate ability\". That analysis proved correct: in 30 further matches in the three seasons up the First World War Sharp passed 50 only twice and did not score another century.Sharp's best years as a batsman in first-class cricket came in the four seasons from 1919. In the limited first-class programme of the first post-war season in 1919, he scored 716 runs at an average of 42.11, \"a marked improvement on his best form in previous seasons,\" Wisden wrote. He had a poor season in 1920, but in the following year, as captain of the side, he made 879 runs at an average of 41.85 and scored four centuries, half the total of his entire career. His highest innings of the season, 150 in the match against Sussex, helped Leicestershire to avoid the follow on and then to achieve a remarkable victory after they had trailed by 141 runs on the first innings. Sharp was re-elected as captain for 1922, and averaged 54 with the bat, but was unable to play in most of the team's matches and handed over the captaincy to Fowke mid-season. Thereafter, he was an occasional rather than regular cricketer, though he continued to play through to 1935 and captained the team in his last first-class match.\nEven after his 27-year first-class career, Sharp was not finished with county cricket: he made non-first-class appearances for Leicestershire in wartime county games right through to 1945, when he was 56 years of age. Sharp's son John played four matches for Leicestershire (and one for Cambridge University) between 1937 and 1946, making his debut just two years after his father's last match: John Sharp went on to become a senior British Army officer and was knighted.\nAubrey Sharp died in 1973 at the age of 83 as a result of a car accident.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Leicestershire cricket captains", "response": ["* Aubrey Sharp (1921)"]}, {"page": "John Sharp (British Army officer)", "response": ["Sharp played first-class cricket for Leicestershire and Cambridge University in five matches between 1937 and 1946. His father, Aubrey Sharp, was a cricketer of greater renown, appearing in first-class cricket for Leicestershire between 1908 and 1935 and captaining the team in 1921 and part of 1922."]}, {"page": "Gustavus Fowke", "response": ["Fowke's military career restricted his cricket opportunities. He appeared in minor matches for Punjab in 1903; and he reappeared for Leicestershire in matches in 1908 and 1911. One of his three matches in 1911 was against Derbyshire at Chesterfield when Aubrey Sharp made 216 in 250 minutes, and Fowke, who scored 67, helped him to put on 262 for the sixth wicket, which remained the Leicestershire record for this wicket until beaten by Phil Simmons and Paul Nixon in 1996. In 1913 his one first-class innings of the season, in the match between the Army and the Royal Navy, produced a score of 113 which would remain his highest.", "At the age of 41 and retired from the Army, Fowke finally embarked on a full-time cricket career with Leicestershire in the 1922 season, having played, before the start of the season, just nine first-class games, four of them 23 years earlier. Leicestershire needed Fowke because of a problem with the captaincy: Aubrey Sharp had been chosen as captain in 1921 and re-appointed for 1922, but the demands of his career as a solicitor meant that he could appear in no more than five games; Fowke was initially picked as a stand-in and as the only available amateur, but then took over the captaincy officially when it became plain that Sharp was not able to resume. The captaincy may have come to him by default as an amateur, but Fowke proved to be worth his place in the team in 1922: he made 977 runs at an average of 23.20, his highest aggregate and average in any season. He did not score any centuries in 1922, but against Derbyshire he made 99 and against Glamorgan he scored 98, and Leicestershire won both games by a substantial margin. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that Fowke was \"one of the most dependable batsmen on the side\" and credited him with improving the fielding of the team, though it added that Leicestershire \"became too fond of stopping the ball with the feet, a tendency due, no doubt, to several of the team being over forty years of age\"."]}, {"page": "Charles Packe (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1932, Leicestershire struggled to find an amateur to captain the team; the 1931 captain, Eddie Dawson was not available and played only once, and the captain from 1921, Aubrey Sharp, was approached but also was able to play only once. Although no formal appointment was made, Packe, home from the army for the first two-thirds of the season, played in 15 matches as captain, one of six amateurs to captain the team at some stage during the season. Even then, Packe's commitment to Leicestershire was not total: the team's most abject defeat of the season came in the match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge when the side was dismissed twice in 160 minutes of batting time by Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, bowling unchanged. Packe missed the debacle because he was playing for the Army cricket team against a touring South American side. Packe's own record as a batsman was modest, with 451 runs in county matches at an average of 18.79, and three scores of more than 50. He left regular cricket before the end of the 1932 season, but reappeared in five games for Leicestershire in 1934."]}]}}
