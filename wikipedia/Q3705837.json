Relatively inexperienced in numismatics at first, he soon had to deal with the classification of the Edward I and II coins in the Boyton hoard of 4000 coins, followed by the classification of the Clarke-Thornhill bequest of 12,000 coins. He became acknowledged as the leading authority on Ancient British coins and as one of the leading  authorities on contemporaneous Continental issues. His project on defining the coinage of Henry II was interrupted by the Second World War and was eventually completed in 1947.Allen joined the British Numismatic Society in 1935 and served as its Secretary from 1938 to 1941 and was  Editor of volumes XXII and XXIII of the Journal. He was elected as president from 1959 to 1963, was awarded the Sanford Saltus medal in 1953 and elected an Honorary Member in 1971. He was afterwards President of the Royal Numismatic Society from 1966 to 1970 and awarded that Society's medal in 1966. \nHe was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1963 and finished his career as Secretary, then Treasurer, of the Academy. After his death in 1975 his widow Winifred Allen established with the Academy in 1976 a prize in his memory - the Derek Allen Prize - to be awarded annually to recognise outstanding published work in Musicology, Celtic Studies and Numismatics.In the 1930s, he dubbed in Italian the actor Stan Laurel and Paolo Canali dubbed Oliver Hardy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mortimer Wheeler", "response": ["Wheeler retained an active interest in the running of these British institutions abroad; in 1967 he visited the British School in Jerusalem amid the Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbours, and in January 1968 visited the Persian institute with the archaeologist Max Mallowan and Mallowan's wife Agatha Christie, there inspecting the excavations at Siraf. In 1969 he proceeded to the Italian city of Rome to inspect the British School there. That year, he resigned as Honorary Secretary of the Academy. The position became a salaried, professional one, with the numismatist Derek Allen taking on the position."]}, {"page": "British Academy", "response": ["*Derek Allen Prize, first awarded in 1977", "* Derek Allen (1969\u20131973)"]}, {"page": "Peter Brunt", "response": ["Having graduated with a double first, he was awarded the Craven Fellowship in 1939. However, with the outbreak of World War II, his academic career went on hold. He volunteered but flat feet prevented him from serving in the military. Instead, he joined the Ministry of Shipping, later the Ministry of War Transport, as a civil servant. He served as Temporary Assistant Principal, and later Temporary Principal. His main duties involved the relinquishing of French ships, and dealing with the legal and diplomatic fallout from this. He additionally spent his nights on fire fighting duty with the Air Raid Precautions. His work as a civil servant allowed him to develop some skill as an administrator and afforded him experiences that he might not have had as a student. Notably, during air-raid duties he made the acquaintance of his fellow worker Violet Bonham Carter, and in the Ministry of Shipping he started a long friendship with Derek Allen."]}, {"page": "List of New York Giants players", "response": ["*Derek Allen"]}, {"page": "British Museum Department of Coins and Medals", "response": ["*Derek Allen"]}, {"page": "List of presidents of the Royal Numismatic Society", "response": ["* 1966\u201370 Derek Allen"]}, {"page": "John Kent (numismatist)", "response": ["There his main interest was the coins of the late Roman period, contributing to the reference book on Late Roman Bronze Coinage which was published in 1960.
