Powell and Lennon started a relationship after meeting in a calligraphy class. When Lennon was performing in Hamburg with the Beatles, Powell rented his bedroom at 251 Menlove Avenue in the Liverpool suburb of Woolton from his aunt and legal guardian, Mimi Smith. After Powell became pregnant, she and Lennon married in August 1962, and the couple lived at Kenwood in Weybridge from 1964 to 1968, where she kept house and participated with Lennon in a London-based social life. In 1968, Lennon left her for Japanese artist Yoko Ono; as a result, the couple's divorce was legally granted in November 1968 on the grounds of adultery.\nPowell had three further marriages. She published a book of memoirs, A Twist of Lennon, in 1978, and a more intimate biography, John, in 2005. Over the years, she held several auctions of memorabilia associated with her life with Lennon. In her later years she lived in Calvi\u00e0, Mallorca, where she died in 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Lennon", "response": ["===Cynthia Lennon==="]}, {"page": "Julian Lennon", "response": ["Lennon visited Kenya, Ethiopia and Colombia in 2014 to witness the education and environmental initiatives by TWFF.

Lennon was still interested in buying or leasing an island to live on together, and discussed it with the other Beatles on 19 July 1967. Mardas' father was a major in the Greek secret police, and Mardas explained that through him the Beatles would have access to Greek government connections, which would speed the acquisition of an island, because many islands did have the right certificates of ownership and were subject to government restrictions. On 22 July 1967, Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd, Ringo Starr and Neil Aspinall flew to Athens, where they stayed in Mardas' parents' house overnight, until Lennon, along with Cynthia Lennon and their son Julian Lennon, McCartney and Jane Asher, Pattie Boyd's 16-year-old sister Paula, Mal Evans and Alistair Taylor set off for Athens.", "Cynthia Lennon personally believed that Mardas invented the story about sexual impropriety to undermine the Maharishi's influence on the Beatles, as Mardas was always jealous of anyone having Lennon's attention.Musician magazine, September 1992, p. 43 \"There was nothing that ever happened except that there was a fella who was supposedly a friend of ours who stirred up and created this big fantasy.

The following month, Paul McCartney drove out to visit the Lennons' five-year-old son Julian, at Kenwood, the family's home in Weybridge. Cynthia had been part of the Beatles' social circle since before the band's rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it \"a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life\". Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney's surprise visit: \"I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.\" The song's original title was \"Hey Jules\", and it was intended to comfort Julian from the stress of his parents' separation. McCartney said, \"I knew it was not going to be easy for him\", and that he changed the name to \"Jude\" \"because I thought that sounded a bit better\".", "In his 1996 article about the single's release, for Mojo, Paul Du Noyer said that the writing of \"Hey Jude\" had become \"one of the best-known stories in Beatles folklore\".

I have incredible sympathy for each of them.\" Du Noyer quoted Cynthia Lennon as saying of \"Hey Jude\", \"it always bring tears to my eyes, that song.\""]}, {"page": "1988 in film", "response": ["| Imagine: John Lennon || Warner Bros.
