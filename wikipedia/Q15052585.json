Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. Jon Day gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion. The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannonballs and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties."]}, {"page": "List of witnesses of the Iraq Inquiry", "response": ["*Jon Day \u2013 Director General, Operational Policy, Ministry of Defence, 2007\u20132008; Policy Director, MoD, 2008\u20132009."]}, {"page": "The White Review", "response": ["The 2017 Short Story Prize was awarded to both a UK and Ireland winner, as well as a US and Canada winner, with two respective shortlists and judging panels.
