The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn summarised that the serial \"has some good ideas in it, but they're treated with such an unambitious lack of imagination that there's not enough actually happening here for the story to be offensively bad\u2014just boring\". He felt the \"most enjoyable part\" was the \"comic squabbling\" between Pertwee and Troughton, and also called the Brigadier a \"saving grace\". DVD Talk's Ian Jane gave the serial three out of five stars, noting that it was \"slightly silly\" and the production designs and special effects were \"definitely not the best that the series has had to offer\". He also felt that the story was wrapped up too quickly and was \"fairly predictable\". However, he praised Pertwee and Troughton's interplay, the fact that Jo was given more to do, and Stephen Thorne's performance as Omega. Alisdair Wilkins of io9 picked The Three Doctors as the worst Doctor Who story of the classic series, feeling that the Second Doctor and the Brigadier were written as too comical, the story had too much padding, and that Omega was a \"shouting, one-dimensional villain\"."]}, {"page": "The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans", "response": ["\"The Bruce-Partington Plans\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989\u20131998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Jamie Glover as Cadogan West and Stephen Thorne as Inspector Lestrade."]}, {"page": "Peter Tinniswood", "response": ["*Uncle Mort's North Country 5 (R4 21.7.1988 -18.8.1988 Stephen Thorne/Peter Skellern/Christian Rodska)", "*Uncle Mort's South Country \u2013 Series 1 5 (R4 12.7.1990 9.8.1990 Stephen Thorne/Sam Kelly/Liz Goulding/Christian Rodska)", "*Uncle Mort's South Country \u2013 Series 2 5 (R4 27.10.1990 -24.11.1990 Stephen Thorne/Sam Kelly/Liz Goulding/Christopher Good/Christian Rodska) ", "*Uncle Mort's Celtic Fringe 5 (R4 12.2.1996 -11.3.1996 Stephen Thorne/Sam Kelly/Christian Rodska/Liz Goulding)"]}, {"page": "The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)", "response": ["* Treebeard: Stephen Thorne"]}, {"page": "Northern Lights (Pullman novel)", "response": ["In 1996 Natasha Richardson narrated an audiobook version of Northern Lights.

During rehearsals for The Time Warrior, it became clear to Jon Pertwee and Letts that the two leads had little rapport and were physically mis-matched (it has been claimed that Pertwee demanded the part be recast, because he said he would not play opposite an actress who was taller than him). Letts therefore released Walker from her contract (though she was still paid in full for season 11). Although committed to not talking about the issue in her release agreement, Walker began to discuss the circumstances surrounding her casting decades later. After giving some written interviews to fanzines, in May 2020 Walker gave an on screen interview to 'Time Space Visualiser' giving much further detail about the circumstances, including revealing later work alongside Pertwee. Walker admitted that although she understood Pertwee's thinking, she told him she would never forgive him for what he had done.Doctor Who: The Lost Sarah-Jane! April Walker interviewed, Fantom Publishing, YouTube, 18 May 2020 Letts began a second batch of auditions and saw Elisabeth Sladen after a recommendation from fellow BBC producer Bill Slater, who had twice cast the actress recently in separate episodes of Z-Cars. Sladen performed her audition alongside actor Stephen Thorne and after impressing Letts, he arranged for her to meet Pertwee before any decisions were made.
