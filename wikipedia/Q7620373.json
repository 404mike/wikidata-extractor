However, Sir Walter Scott, John Wilson (1785\u20131854) and his brother James (1795\u20131856), John Lockhart, and others, raised a lottery for it, with 100 subscribers at \u00a310 10s. each, and the picture was won by Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss. Allan remained in Edinburgh, and though his pictures (including Tartar Robbers dividing their Spoil) did not find purchasers amongst his countrymen, some of them were bought by the Grand Duke Nicholas when he visited Edinburgh, which resulted in a turn of fortune for the artist. Allan afterwards painted some scenes from Scottish history suggested by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, such as Death of Archbishop Sharpe and Knox admonishing Mary Queen of Scots (exhibited in 1823 and engraved by John Burnet). Also of note were Mary Queen of Scots signing her Abdication (1824) and Death of the Regent Murray (exhibited 1825), which was purchased by the Duke of Bedford for 800 guineas, and gained the artist his election as an associate of the Royal Academy."]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Peeblesshire", "response": ["*Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss 10 August 1853 \u2013 1880"]}, {"page": "Francis Douglas, 8th Earl of Wemyss", "response": ["*Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss (1796\u20131883)"]}, {"page": "Francis Charteris, 10th Earl of Wemyss", "response": ["He was the eldest son and heir of Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss and Lady Louisa Bingham.
