He was born in Southgate, London, on 31 July 1809 and died at Wanstead, England on 5 October 1874. He was one of the most prolific authors in entomology, and stirred controversy during his later life as his publications resulted in a huge number of junior synonyms.\nWalker was contracted by the British Museum between June 1848 and late 1873 to catalogue their insects (except Coleoptera). Walker added an immense amount of material to the collections of the British Museum and wrote over 300 scientific papers and notes. He is best known for his catalogues of Orthoptera, Neuroptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. Collaborating with Alexander Henry Haliday, a lifelong friend, he was one of the first students of the Chalcidoidea. He was also a close friend of John Curtis. Walker was a fellow of the Entomological Society.

In 1842, he was appointed High Sheriff of Antrim and lived in the townland of Ballyhowne in the parish of Carnmoney.", "Haliday's collection comprising 78 boxes was presented by Trinity of Ireland College to the Museum of Science and Art (now the National Museum of Ireland) in 1882, twelve years after Haliday's death. The dating of the parts of the collection is confusing but the bulk of it was put together before 1860. Although the collection was damaged, and substantial portions of it have been lost, it remains a very large insect collection. The bulk of the material collected by Haliday himself is in the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera. The undamaged Hymenoptera material is laid out in numbered blocks of systematised taxa, usually disparate groups (representing species) disposed below the appropriate generic name. Most of Haliday's specimens are from Ireland, however several of them are from England, Scotland, and Italy. In addition to the specialist collections of Hymenoptera and Diptera, there is Haliday's own general collection (mainly Coleoptera), and a large body of material added to the collection by other entomologists. The largest single source of donations to the collection was Francis Walker, the London entomologist with whom Haliday had a career-long association. The Walker addition was made up mostly of Hymenoptera and Diptera insects, however it contained insects of most other orders, especially Coleoptera and Thysanoptera. Other collectors represented are John Curtis, James Charles Dale, Jean Antoine Dours, Arnold F\u00f6rster or Foerster, Hermann Loew, Fernandino Maria Piccioli, G.T.Rudd, William Wilson Saunders, JamesFrancis Stephens, and Thomas Vernon Wollaston.

The Society maintained an excellent library and received many journals from corresponding members of English and continental natural history societies. Notable contributors were John Obadiah Westwood, Francis Walker, Carl August Dohrn), Maximilian Spinola and John Gould and Charles Darwin. Many of the collections and some of the books were transferred to the Trinity College Museum, Dublin in 1843 after the society became the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society in 1842 when lectures in chemistry, physics, engineering and were allowed. Specimens remaining in Belfast are kept in the Ulster Museum where they bear the tag BNHPS collection. The formerly central role of natural history and archaeology diminished from this year on and in 1863 the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club was founded.
