At the time of his death, Wilkes was an Emeritus Professor at the University of Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Control unit", "response": ["The idea of microprogramming was introduced by Maurice Wilkes in 1951 as an intermediate level to execute computer program instructions. Microprograms were organized as a sequence of microinstructions and stored in special control memory. The algorithm for the microprogram control unit, unlike the hardwired control unit, is usually specified by flowchart description. The main advantage of a microprogrammed control unit is the simplicity of its structure. Outputs from the controller are by microinstructions. The microprogram can be debugged and replaced very like software."]}, {"page": "EDSAC", "response": ["The Electronic delay storage automatic calculator (EDSAC)  was an early British computer. Inspired by John von Neumann's seminal First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, the machine was constructed by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England. EDSAC was the second electronic digital stored-program computer to go into regular service.The 1948 Manchester Baby computer predated EDSAC as a stored-program computer, but was built largely as a test bed for the Williams tube and not as a machine for general use. See \"A brief informal history of the Computer Laboratory\". However, the Baby was developed into a practically useful successor, the Manchester Mark\u00a01 of 1949, which was available for general use by other university departments and Ferranti in April 1949, despite still being under development; EDSAC first ran in May 1949, while also still being under development.

Microprogramming allows the base instruction set to be defined or extended by built-in programs (now called firmware or microcode). This concept greatly simplified CPU development.

His initial implementation consisted of a pair of matrices: the first one generated signals in the manner of the Whirlwind control store, while the second matrix selected which row of signals (the microprogram instruction word, so to speak) to invoke on the next cycle. Conditionals were implemented by providing a way that a single line in the control store could choose from alternatives in the second matrix. This made the control signals conditional on the detected internal signal. Wilkes coined the term microprogramming to describe this feature and distinguish it from a simple control store."]}, {"page": "November 29", "response": ["*  2010   \u2013 Maurice Wilkes, English physicist and computer scientist (b. 1913)"]}, {"page": "Timeline of programming languages", "response": ["| Maurice Wilkes"]}, {"page": "Turing Award", "response": ["|Maurice Wilkes"]}, {"page": "1913", "response": ["** Maurice Wilkes, British computer scientist (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "Software bug", "response": ["Finding and fixing bugs, or debugging, is a major part of computer programming.
