He was a member of the House of Lords, Chancellor of the International Monarchist League, and an active businessman who later became a tax exile in Monaco.Victor Hervey was the only son of Herbert Hervey, 5th Marquess of Bristol. He acquired a notorious reputation as a playboy and petty criminal in the 1930s, which culminated in him being imprisoned for jewellery theft in 1939. He inherited the Marquessate on his father's death in 1960, and acquired a large fortune through this and his business dealings. He was married three times and is the father of John Hervey, 7th Marquess of Bristol, Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol, Lord Nicholas Hervey, Lady Victoria Hervey, and Lady Isabella Hervey.

The estate office closed in 1989.Pawley 1996, p. 122. Much of the land went to property developers and subsequent decades brought new housing and a considerable rise in population. According to a council report, people were attracted to the town by \"the quality of life, low crime rates, relatively low house prices and good-quality education\". From 1981 to 2011, Sleaford's population rose from 8,000 to 18,000; the growth rate in 1991\u20132001 was the fastest of any town in the county. The infrastructure struggled to cope, especially with increased traffic congestion. Two bypasses opened and a one-way system was introduced, a process that Simon Pawley argues accelerated the decline of the High Street. In the early 2000s, the Single Regeneration Budget of \u00a315 million granted to Sleaford improved the town centre and funded development of the Hub (from 2011 to 2021, the National Centre for Craft & Design) in the old Navigation wharves area."]}, {"page": "Lady Isabella Hervey", "response": ["Lady Isabella Frederica Louisa de Pauw (n\u00e9e Hervey, () born 9 March 1982) is a British model, actress, and fitness trainer.

Despite inheriting a large fortune of up to \u00a335 million, the Marquess spent most of it during his lifetime. He struggled with addiction to cocaine and other drugs, serving several jail sentences for possession, and was known for his flamboyant lifestyle and homosexuality.
