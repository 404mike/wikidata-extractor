He was also to compel the citizens of Dublin to fortify the city itself. In 1207 FitzHenry was given the land of Offaly by King John, taken from under the lordship of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, thereby incurring hatred from the fellow barons of Ireland and head families. Those dissatisfied with King John's decision to hand over Offaly petitioned for its return, from which they received a strong rebuke from John Marshal, William Marshal's nephew, who had been named marshal of Ireland by King John. King John summoned Meiler FitzHenry, William Marshal, and other men to discuss the matter, during which FitzHenry instructed his men to attack Leinster, the land held by William Marshal who was also FitzHenry's lord. Receiving minor punishment, FitzHenry was allowed to return to Ireland with three letters that summoned to England the officers that were protecting Leinster for William Marshal. These men refused to leave their lord's land unprotected and so fought off the attacks by FitzHenry and his men. Ultimately, Meiler FitzHenry and his men were captured, their first born sons, or whatever children were available, demanded as a sign of good behavior. FitzHenry held the justiciarship until 1208, at the conclusion of Offaly being returned to William Marshal. The last writ addressed to him in that capacity is dated 19 June 1208. John Thomas GilbertViceroys of Ireland (1865) p.\u00a059 stated that he was superseded between 1203 and 1205 by Hugh de Lacy, but many writs are addressed to him as Justice during these years. On several occasions assessors or counsellors were associated with him in his work, and he was directed to do nothing of exceptional importance without their advice (e.g. Hugh de Lacy in 1205)."]}, {"page": "Philip Flattisbury", "response": ["Flattisbury also transcribed for Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, in 1517, a collection of Anglo-Irish annals in Latin, terminating in 1370 (linked by the DNB to the chronicles of John Pembridge).

Edmund Campion, in his History of Ireland, written in 1571, and Richard Stanihurst, somewhat later, referred erroneously to Flattisbury as the author of the annals of which he was the transcriber. Stanihurst did not record the date of Flattisbury's death, but mentioned that it took place \u2018at his town styled Johnstown,\u2019 near Naas, in Kildare, and observes that he was a \u2018worthy gentleman and a diligent antiquary.\u2019 The original annals, from which Flattisbury transcribed, were printed for the first time in 1607 by William Camden, in his Britannia, from a manuscript lent to him by Lord Howard of Naworth Castle, and subsequently presented by Archbishop Laud to the Bodleian Library, where it is now preserved. A new edition from the manuscript used by Camden, and collated with fragments of an older one unknown to him, was published by John Thomas Gilbert, Flattisbury's DNB biographer, in the appendix to the Chartularies of St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin, Rolls Series, 1885."]}]}}
