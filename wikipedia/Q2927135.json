On leaving Wakefield he joined Sandal RFC.\n\nDavid Ingall in the club history book describes how \"he brought both power and subtlety to the outside centre position, with an eye for the smallest gap in the defence or the pace and strength to carry him round his opponent. His tackling was devastating, and he kicked accurately and purposefully from hand\" \nHe played for Yorkshire and England at both 16 and 19 groups and toured Australia in his second year with the England Under 19 group in 1979.\nHe first played for Yorkshire in 1979, touring with them to France in 1980. He played for England under 23's in 1980 and 1982 and England Students in 1983.\nhe won the first of his seven England caps against Ireland in the 1984 Five Nations championships.
