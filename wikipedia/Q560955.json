He subsequently became notorious for his escape from prison in 1965, living as a fugitive for 36 years, and for his various publicity stunts while in exile. In 2001, Biggs returned to the United Kingdom and spent several years in prison, where his health rapidly declined. He was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2009 and died in a nursing home in December 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sex Pistols", "response": ["Cook, Jones and Vicious never performed together again live after Rotten's departure. Over the next several months, McLaren arranged for recordings in Brazil (with Jones and Cook), Paris (with Vicious) and London; each of the three and others stepped in as lead vocalists on tracks that in some cases were far from what punk was expected to sound like. These recordings were to make up the musical soundtrack for the reconceived Pistols feature film project, directed by Julien Temple, to which McLaren was now devoting himself. On 30 June, a single credited to the Sex Pistols was released: on one side, notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs sang \"No One Is Innocent\" accompanied by Jones and Cook; on the other, Vicious sang the classic \"My Way\", over both a Jones\u2013Cook backing track and a string orchestra.Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, p. 145. Gimarc refers to sources claiming that the \"My Way\" recording involved no contact between Vicious and the Jones-Cook duo; Temple, however, says that Jones was flown over to Paris to join Vicious in the studio (Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 1:29:18\u20131:29:20), and seems to indicate that he recorded his guitar part there (1:33:09\u20131:33:16). The single reached number seven on the charts, eventually outselling all the singles with which Rotten was involved.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 497\u2013498. Savage describes the single as being a double A-side; other sources indicate that the Biggs vocal was the A-side and the Vicious vocal the B-side (e.g., Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, p. 145). There is no disagreement that the Vicious side was the more popular. McLaren was seeking to reconstitute the band with a permanent new frontman, but Vicious\u2014McLaren's first choice\u2014had sickened of him. In return for agreeing to record \"My Way\", Vicious had demanded that McLaren sign a sheet of paper declaring that he was no longer Vicious's manager. In August, Vicious, back in London, delivered his final performances as a nominal Sex Pistol: recording and filming cover versions of two Eddie Cochran songs. The bassist's return to New York in September put an end to McLaren's dreaming.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 491\u2013494, 497\u2013503.

McLaren himself takes the mic for a couple of numbers. Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early, unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded backing by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco.

Much subsequent commentary on the Sex Pistols has relied on taking seriously McLaren's onscreen proclamations in the film, whether lending them credence or not.

(despite the fact that the movie purveys, among other things, a completely illiterate Steve Jones, a talking dog, and Sid Vicious shooting audience members, including his mother, at the conclusion of \"My Way\"). Temple points out that McLaren's characterization was intended as \"a big fucking joke\u2014that he was the puppetmeister who created these pieces of clay from plasticine boxes that he modeled away and made Johnny Rotten, made Sid Vicious. It was a joke that they were completely manufactured.\"Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 1:24\u20131:40.
