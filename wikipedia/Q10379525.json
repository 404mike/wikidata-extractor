On 14 November 2016, majority shareholder Dave Allen resigned from his roles as chairman and director of the club. This signalled a crisis, and four days later a further four directors resigned from their roles. It was announced that Chesterfield was openly up for sale, and desperately needed some kind of investment in order to avoid administration. Mike Warner was installed as chairman on 19 November. On 8 January 2017, manager Danny Wilson was sacked, with Gary Caldwell being announced as his replacement nine days later. On 16 September 2017, manager Caldwell was sacked after three wins in 29 competitive games, giving him the worst win record of any Spireites manager.

Barnard became a Welsh international during this season, making his debut for Wales in a 0\u20130 draw against Jamaica on 25 March 1998 and went on to collect 18 caps whilst at Barnsley. Unfortunately for Barnsley, the Premier League dream lasted only one season, but Barnard played on for them in the First Division for another four seasons and played in the 1999\u201300 playoff final defeat to Ipswich Town, in which he missed the opening penalty in the match, the last missed penalty at the old Wembley Stadium, although Barnsley was awarded another which Craig Hignett scored. The goalkeeper, Richard Wright, was later sold to Arsenal. In the 1998\u201399 season, Barnard turned down a move to go to Southampton in November, on his first game after he declined the move he scored what possibly could be one of the all-time great goals for his club and himself, a left-footed volley from the corner of the penalty area after a fine pass by Nicky Eaden. The goal was in Barnsley's 7\u20131 win over Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Town on 27 November 1998, a game shown live on Sky Sports.
