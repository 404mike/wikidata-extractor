He was not the son of actor-manager Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson, as erroneously stated in the press at the time of his death; he was the grandson of one of Sir Johnston's brothers. He began his acting career on the stage, starting at the Intimate Theatre in Palmers Green, before pursuing a film and TV career in the 1950s and 1960s, usually in minor roles, in films such as The Battle of the River Plate (1956), Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965) and The Spy with a Cold Nose (1966). He made two films for Hammer - The Vampire Lovers (1970), as the Man in Black, and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974), as Dracula. Other film credits include Nicholas and Alexandra (1971), The Vault of Horror (1973), Venom (1981) and Lifeforce (1985). On TV he appeared in a 1975 episode of Thriller (\"The Next Voice You See\") and played Leonard Rossiter's love rival, Henry Possett, in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin (1976).\nHis last appearance on screen was in a documentary, The Legend of Hammer: Vampires (2008), directed by Don Fearney.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nicholas and Alexandra", "response": ["*John Forbes-Robertson as Colonel Voikov"]}, {"page": "Hammer Film Productions", "response": ["* The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974; The 7 Brothers Meet Dracula in the U.S.), featuring John Forbes-Robertson as Dracula in place of Christopher Lee.", "Christopher Lee grew increasingly disillusioned with the direction the character was being taken and with the poor quality of later scripts, although he did improve these slightly himself by adding lines of dialogue from the original novel. Lee speaks at least one line taken from Bram Stoker in every Dracula film he appeared in, except for Dracula: Prince of Darkness in which the Count does not talk at all (Lee claimed repeatedly he was appalled by his dialogue in that film and refused to speak it, but Jimmy Sangster rebutted that no dialogue was written for the character). He was also concerned about typecasting, and after filming The Satanic Rites of Dracula he finally quit the series.  John Forbes-Robertson took over the role for one final outing as the Count."]}, {"page": "2008 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 14 || John Forbes-Robertson || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 80 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "Lifeforce (film)", "response": ["* John Forbes-Robertson as The Minister", "Despite being credited on the US domestic cut, the following actors were deleted from that cut of the film: John Woodnutt, John Forbes-Robertson and Russell Sommers.
