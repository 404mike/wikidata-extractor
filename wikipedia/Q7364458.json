This was followed by appearances in many television series such as Doctor Who, Blake's 7, Are You Being Served?, The Gentle Touch, The Comic Strip Presents - (Five Go Mad in Dorset), Dear John and Dramarama. He also appeared in films such as the James Bond film A View to a Kill (1985), Eat the Rich (1987) and Willow (1988).\nHe was perhaps best known as the background character Big Ron in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. He played the role of Big Ron from the show's inception in 1985 to just before his death in October 1997. His character had very few central storylines but was often seen interacting with the main characters in the show. After his death, he appeared in pre-recorded episodes that he had filmed before his death. To explain the absence of his character, in early 1998 his character was written out of the series in a storyline in which Big Ron won the lottery and moved to Spain.\nTarr also appeared in a series of 1980s television advertisements for Do it All a now-defunct DIY chain in the United Kingdom.On 20 October 1997, Tarr died of cancer aged 60.
