His sons, Johann Jakob and Salomon produced cast iron, built fire extinguishers, pumps, and apparatus for the textile industry; later they also started installing heaters. In 1836 the workforce grew to around forty journeymen, subworkers and apprentices. In 1839 a foundry was added, a mechanical workshop was set up and the first steam engine was built and installed in Winterthur (1841). In 1845, the company's own \"Sick Support Association for Factory Workers\" was founded. This later became the Sulzer Health Insurance Fund, which was renamed Provita in 1997 and now operates as an independent health insurance fund as part of the SWICA insurance company. In 1851, the English engineer Charles Brown joined Sulzer. With the development of new steam engines, he was instrumental for the early successes and growth of the company. In 1859, the first \"partnership agreement\" between the Sulzer brothers was signed. New products were introduced, first steam engines, later also ships, new organization, and production methods. Around 1860 Sulzer opened its first foreign sales office in Turin, and in 1867 the company participated in the world exhibition in Paris. The workforce had grown to more than 1,000 workers."]}, {"page": "1871 in rail transport", "response": ["* Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works established in Winterthur by English engineer Charles Brown."]}, {"page": "Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works", "response": ["The company was founded in 1871 by the British engineer Charles Brown.
