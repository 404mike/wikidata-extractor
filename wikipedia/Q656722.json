Born in Normandy, he moved to London, where he became one of the leading printers of the generation following William Caxton. His books were printed to a high standard of craftsmanship, and his Morton Missal (1500) is regarded as among the finest books printed in England in the period.\nPynson was appointed King's Printer to Henry VII and Henry VIII, and printed and published much official legal material. In addition he produced a wide range of books, including the first printed cookery book in English, an illustrated edition of The Canterbury Tales, and the first English book to use roman type.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoffrey Chaucer", "response": ["Richard Pynson, the King's Printer under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer; however, in the process, he introduced five previously printed texts that are now known not to be Chaucer's. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.)"]}, {"page": "Magna Carta", "response": ["The first mechanically printed edition of Magna Carta was probably the  of 1508 by Richard Pynson, although the early printed versions of the 16th century incorrectly attributed the origins of Magna Carta to Henry III and 1225, rather than to John and 1215, and accordingly worked from the later text. An abridged English-language edition was published by John Rastell in 1527."]}, {"page": "Samuel Pepys", "response": ["* Incunabula by William Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, and Richard Pynson"]}, {"page": "1529", "response": ["** Richard Pynson, Norman-born English printer (b. 1448)"]}, {"page": "Middle English", "response": ["The Chancery Standard's influence on later forms of written English is disputed, but it did undoubtedly provide the core around which Early Modern English formed. Early Modern English emerged with the help of William Caxton's printing press, developed during the 1470s. The press stabilized English through a push towards standardization, led by Chancery Standard enthusiast and writer Richard Pynson.cf. 'Sawles Warde' (The protection of the soul) Early Modern English began in the 1540s after the printing and wide distribution of the English Bible and Prayer Book, which made the new standard of English publicly recognizable, and lasted until about 1650."]}, {"page": "English cuisine", "response": ["The early modern period saw the gradual arrival of printed cookery books, though the very first, the printer Richard Pynson's 1500 Boke of Cokery was compiled from medieval texts. The next, A Proper Newe Booke of Cokerye, was published sometime after 1545. The Secretes of the Reverende Maister Alexis of Piermont was published in 1558, translated from a French translation of Alessio Piemontese's original Italian work on confectionery. The number of titles expanded rapidly towards the end of the century to include Thomas Dawson's The Good Huswifes Jewell in 1585, the Book of Cookrye by \"A. W.\" in 1591, and John Partridge's The Good Hous-wives Handmaide in 1594. These books were of two kinds: collections of so-called secrets on confectionery and health remedies, aimed at aristocratic ladies; and advice on cookery and how to manage a household, aimed at women from more ordinary backgrounds, most likely wives of minor aristocrats, clergymen, and professional men."]}, {"page": "William Caxton", "response": ["Caxton is credited with standardising the English language through printing\u2014that is, homogenising regional dialects and largely adopting the London dialect. This facilitated the expansion of English vocabulary, the regularisation of inflection and syntax, and a widening gap between the spoken and the written word. Richard Pynson started printing in London in 1491 or 1492 and favoured what came to be called Chancery Standard, largely based on the London dialect. Pynson was a more accomplished stylist than Caxton and consequently pushed the English language further toward standardisation."]}, {"page": "Alexander Barclay", "response": ["Most of Barclay's works were made in collaboration with the printer Richard Pynson. He wrote five Eclogues, part printed by Wynkyn de Worde around 1518, and printed in full in John Cawood's 1570 edition. The sources of the Eclogues include works by Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, Baptista Mantuanus, and Jean Lemaire de Belges. The Eclogues include laments for John Alcock, John Morton, and Roger Westminster, Prior of Ely.Antony Hasler, Court Poetry in Late Medieval England and Scotland (Cambridge, 2011), pp. 88-93."]}, {"page": "Almanac", "response": ["After almanacs were devised, people still saw little difference between predicting the movements of the stars and tides, and predicting the future in the divination sense. Early almanacs therefore contained general horoscopes, as well as natural information. In 1150 Solomon Jarchus created such an almanac considered to be among the first modern examples. Copies of 12th century almanacs are found in the British Museum, and in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. In 1300, Petrus de Dacia created an almanac (Savilian Library, Oxford) the same year Roger Bacon, OFM, produced his own. In 1327 Walter de Elvendene created an almanac and later on John Somers of Oxford, in 1380. In 1386 Nicholas de Lynne, Oxford produced an almanac. In 1457 the first printed almanac was published at Mainz, by Gutenberg (eight years before the famous Bible). Regio-Montanus produced an almanac in 1472 (Nuremberg, 1472), which continued in print for several centuries. In 1497 the Sheapheard\u2019s Kalendar, translated from French (Richard Pynson) became the first almanac to be printed in English."]}, {"page": "Fleet Street", "response": ["Publishing started in Fleet Street around 1500 when William Caxton's apprentice, Wynkyn de Worde, set up a printing shop near Shoe Lane, while at around the same time Richard Pynson set up as publisher and printer next to St Dunstan's Church.  More printers and publishers followed, mainly supplying the legal trade in the four Inns of Court around the area, but also publishing books and plays."]}, {"page": "15th century in literature", "response": ["**The Seven Sages of Rome, midland English version of the Seven Wise Masters story cycle (printed by Richard Pynson)"]}, {"page": "1529 in literature", "response": ["**Richard Pynson, French-born English printer (born 1448)"]}, {"page": "1516 in literature", "response": ["*Robert Fabyan (anonymous; died c. 1512) \u2013 The New Chronicles of England and France (published by Richard Pynson in London)"]}, {"page": "History of copyright", "response": ["The first copyright privilege in England bears date 1518 and was issued to Richard Pynson, King's Printer, the successor to William Caxton.  The privilege gives a monopoly for the term of two years.  The date is 15 years later than that of the first privilege issued in France. Early copyright privileges were called \"monopolies,\" particularly during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who frequently gave grants of monopolies in articles of common use, such as salt, leather, coal, soap, cards, beer, and wine. The practice was continued until the Statute of Monopolies was enacted in 1623, ending most monopolies, with certain exceptions, such as patents; after 1623, grants of Letters patent to publishers became common.Deazley, Ronan.
