George Ferdinando was 65 when he bought the house and as his children were grown up his wife was unwilling to take on another large house and so he produced a sales notice, the idea being to sell the house as one lot in America. Encouraged by the then current fashion amongst wealthy American citizens for inhabiting ancient European houses and palazzi, Ferdinando produced a sales brochure advertising Basildon to any American citizen for $1,000,000. For this sum, he promised to \"carefully take it down\" and \"re-erect in America\", thus providing an opportunity to \"Any patriotic American wishing to benefit his native state by presenting this imposing building \u2026 ready for occupation as a private residence, museum, college building or public library.\" Fortunately he had a change of heart and decided instead to convert the old sawmill at the top of the park into a house for himself and his wife. George also persuaded one of his sons Eric to return from America where he was a cotton grower with his young family to live in the south pavilion then called the east wing. Eric then oversaw the return of fixtures and fittings such as the stair balustrade, the renovation and running of the house and estate. No evidence is available to say whether it was George Ferdinando, the first Lord Iliffe or the executors of the Morrison estate who sold off the dining room fixtures.

McFadden said in 1976 that \"several bowls and figures are, at present, unlocated, including the bowl and figure of Tiberius, the Claudius figure and bowl, the Nero bowl, and the figure of Galba\".  The locations of these items have become known since the 1970s.  The complete Claudius tazza (figure and bowl) is in a private collection, as is the bowl of the Nero tazza; the figure of Galba is in Lisbon, with a bowl identified as part of the Caligula tazza."]}]}}
