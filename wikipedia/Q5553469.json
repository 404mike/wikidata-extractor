Bennet coined the term \"Quakers\" to refer to the Religious Society of Friends.\nBennet was Mayor of Derby in 1645 when there was a plague in Derby. He was also a magistrate and in 1650, he and Nathaniel Barton conducted the trial of George Fox, founder of the Religious Society of Friends.  Fox told the bench \"Tremble at the word of the Lord\", to which Bennett replied that the only \"quaker\" in court was him, after which the nickname Quakers to refer to members of the Society entered common parlance.In 1653, Bennet was nominated for the Barebones Parliament as representative for Derbyshire. In 1654, he was elected Member of Parliament for Derby in the First Protectorate Parliament and was returned in the Second Protectorate Parliament in 1656 and the Third Protectorate Parliament of 1659.Bennet owned estates of Littleover and Snelston.

Thus the name Quaker began as a way of ridiculing Fox's admonition, but became widely accepted and used by some Quakers.

The Derby Mercury reported her name as Tobiah and said she was the best of three female speakers. The journalist also noted that she was speaking in Derby and this was the town where the Quakers first got their name. This was the town, but the newspaper gave the wrong reason. It was a Derby magistrate, Gervase Bennet, who had first used the term to deride George Fox in 1650 as he tried him for blasphemy. It is thought that Darby was speaking at the same place at which George Fox had been imprisoned, although she may not have been aware of it, as this was a new town hall.The Early Years in Derby, William Carey, Retrieved 8 October 2015"]}]}}
