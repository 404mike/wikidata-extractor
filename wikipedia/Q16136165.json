He was a medium pace seam bowler, who took over 400 first-class wickets spanning a twelve-year period between 1974 and 1986. Griffiths later played for Lincolnshire and continued playing league cricket into his fifties.\nHe is however best remembered not for his bowling but for his inept batting, managing a career average of just over 3 runs per innings, which is the second-lowest by any regular first-class cricketer ahead of Francis McHugh of Yorkshire and Gloucestershire. Griffiths was out 51 times in his career without scoring and early in his career played ten consecutive innings without scoring a run, breaking the long-time record of Tom Goddard, Seymour Clark and Brian Boshier. Griffiths\u2019 batting was considered so inferior that his local club nicknamed him \"the world\u2019s worst batsman\" and \"the wally of the willow\".\nIronically however, perhaps Griffiths\u2019 most celebrated achievement in his cricketing career came with the bat; playing Lancashire in the 1981 Natwest Trophy semi-final on Northamptonshire's home ground, Griffiths came in at number 11 with fellow tail-ender Tim Lamb still needing 13 runs to win, with one of the world\u2019s most fearsome fast bowlers of the period, Michael Holding, running in at one end. Somehow, both Griffiths and Lamb stood firm and held on, managing to accumulate the runs required, with Griffiths getting off the mark after twenty-nine balls and hitting the winning run and being carried off shoulder high by the partisan crowd. Three years later, Griffiths made eleven runs against Kent to level the scores and was run out attempting a bye off the last ball of the day, resulting in the first tie ever at Wantage Road.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Griffiths", "response": ["James or Jim Griffiths may refer to:", "*Jim Griffiths (1890\u20131975), Welsh politician", "*Jim Griffiths (cricketer) (born 1949), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Jim Griffiths", "|align=left|Jim Griffiths"]}, {"page": "1979 Gillette Cup Final", "response": ["|| Jim Griffiths || 12 || 1 || 58 || 2 || 4.83", "| Jim Griffiths || b Garner || 0 || 2 || 0.00"]}, {"page": "Brian Griffiths", "response": ["* Jim Griffiths (cricketer) (Brian James Griffiths, born 1949), Northamptonshire bowler"]}, {"page": "Brian Griffiths (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim Griffiths (cricketer)"]}]}}
