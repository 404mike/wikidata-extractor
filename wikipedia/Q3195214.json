He returned home to Grimsby and was appointed part-time Goalkeeping coach at Grimsby Town during the 2007\u20132008 season by Alan Buckley, who was now in his third spell with the club. On 9 July 2010 Croudson played the second half of Grimsby's 1\u20130 pre-season friendly victory over Non League side Brigg Town.

The last time Steve had pulled his gloves on for Grimsby the club had been three divisions higher than their current place inside the Conference. In a solid display, reminiscent of his professional debut for Town 11 years previously Steve pulled off some fine saves and Grimsby were victorious to the scoreline of 2\u20131 against Histon and was named the man of the match.

In the summer of 2011 Grimsby brought in James McKeown as a backup keeper to Kenny Arthur to ease the dependency on Croudson.
