In 1959 he married Lucy Catherine King, the only daughter of Sir John Knewstub Maurice Rothenstein CBE. They had one son and three daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1978. His chief interest lay in The Black Raven Press of which he was a director.\nIn 1962 Lord Dynevor inherited the remaining holdings of the Llandeilo Estate, comprising 23 farms, and 2,000 acres (8 km\u00b2), a ruined castle, a deer park with a herd of rare long horned white cattle, and a substantial death duties bill. The death duties were owed on both the 7th and 8th Barons.\nAttempts were made to save the patrimony but eventually the castle was sold to a private buyer in 1974. The National Trust bought the deer park and the outer park at Dinefwr in 1987. Newton House was purchased by the Trust in 1990 having been through several hands since first sold by Lord Dynevor in 1974. It was in a very poor state of repair. The East Drive was acquired in 1992. The Home Farm was acquired in 2002.  Cadw and the National Trust now control the estate of some 700 acres (3 km\u00b2).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Soames", "response": ["Soames was born in Penn, Buckinghamshire, England, the son of Captain Arthur Granville Soames (the brother of Olave Baden-Powell, World Chief Guide, both descendants of a brewing family who had joined the landed gentry) by his marriage to Hope Mary Woodbine Parish.
