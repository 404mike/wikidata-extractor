The editorship of the Taxatio Ecclesiastica and the Calendarium Rotulorum Patentium (Record Commission, 1802, 2 vols, folio), has been ascribed in error to Astle; John Caley edited the former work, and Caley with Samuel Ayscough the latter one."]}, {"page": "Thomas Madox", "response": ["**Samuel Ayscough's Catalogue of MSS.

These went to the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Left by Bridges as an heirloom to his family, they were placed by his brother William, secretary of the stamp office, in the hands of Gibbons, a stationer and law-bookseller at the Middle Temple Gate, who circulated proposals for their publication by subscription, and engaged Samuel Jebb to edit them. Before many numbers had appeared Gibbons became bankrupt, and the manuscripts remaining in the hands of the editor, who had received no compensation for his labours, were at length secured by William Cartwright, M.P., of Aynho, for his native county, and a local committee was formed to accomplish the publication of the work. This was entrusted to the Rev. Peter Whalley, a master at Christ's Hospital. The first volume appeared in 1762, and the first part of the second in 1769; but delay arose after the death of Sir Thomas Cave, chairman of the committee, and the entire work was not published till 1791.The History and Antiquities of Northamptonshire.
