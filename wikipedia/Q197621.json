It consisted of a pair of lips with a lapping tongue. Designer John Pasche created the logo following a suggestion by Jagger to copy the out stuck tongue of the Hindu goddess Kali. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo,  The tongue and lips design was part of a package that VH1 named the \"No.\u00a01 Greatest Album Cover\" of all time in 2003. The logo has remained on all the Stones' post-1970 albums and singles, in addition to their merchandise and stage sets. The album contains one of their best-known hits, \"Brown Sugar\", and the country-influenced \"Dead Flowers\". \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\" were recorded at Alabama's Muscle Shoals Sound Studio during the 1969 American tour. The album continued the band's immersion into heavily blues-influenced compositions. The album is noted for its \"loose, ramshackle ambience\" and marked Mick Taylor's first full release with the band. Sticky Fingers reached number one in both the UK and the US. The Stones' Decca catalogue is currently owned by Klein's ABKCO label. In 1968, the Stones, acting on a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control room in a van and created a mobile recording studio so they would not be limited to the standard 9\u20135 operating hours of most recording studios. The band lent the mobile studio to other artists, including Led Zeppelin, who used it to record Led Zeppelin III (1970) and Led Zeppelin IV (1971). Deep Purple immortalised the mobile studio itself in the song \"Smoke on the Water\" with the line \"the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside, making our music there\"."]}, {"page": "Sticky Fingers", "response": ["The album features the first usage of the tongue and lips logo of Rolling Stones Records, originally designed by John Pasche in 1970. Jagger suggested to Pasche that he copy the outstuck tongue of the Hindu goddess Kali, and while Pasche first felt it would date the image back to the Indian culture craze of the 1960s, seeing Kali made him change his mind. Before the end of that year his basic version was faxed to Craig Braun by Marshall Chess. The black & white copy was then modified by Braun and his team, resulting in today's most popular red version, the slim one with the two white stripes on the tongue. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo, \"Without using the Stones' name, it instantly conjures them, or at least Jagger, as well as a certain lasciviousness that is the Stones' own ...
