In Great Britain, Margaret Benyon began using holography as an artistic medium in the late 1960s and had a solo exhibition at the University of Nottingham art gallery in 1969. This was followed in 1970 by a solo show at the Lisson Gallery in London, which was billed as the \"first London expo of holograms and stereoscopic paintings\"."]}, {"page": "2000 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Mrs Margaret Benyon, Holographic Artist.
