He performed in musical theatre in the West End and on tour between 1950 and 1956, including 800 performances starring in a revue called Jokers Wild with The Crazy Gang.  He also began a concert career.  In 1957, he was engaged by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and immediately began to perform eight principal roles in repertory, including Pooh-Bah in The Mikado.  He remained with the company for 25 years until it closed, also making about twenty recordings with the company, and several recordings for Readers' Digest and others.\nIn later years, Sandford continued to tour in and direct Gilbert and Sullivan productions, often with his former D'Oyly Carte colleague Roberta Morrell.  After The International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival was established in 1994, he often performed and lectured for the festival's audiences and held master classes for its performers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Sergeant||Richard Watson||Kenneth Sandford||George Cook||Michael Rayner||Clive Harre"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|Pooh-Bah||Fisher Morgan||Kenneth Sandford||Kenneth Sandford||Kenneth Sandford", "In 1966, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made a film version of The Mikado that closely reflected their traditional staging, although there are some minor cuts.
