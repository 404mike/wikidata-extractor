According to one of his biographers, Charlotte Gray, Bell's work ranged \"unfettered across the scientific landscape\" and he often went to bed voraciously reading the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, scouring it for new areas of interest. The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the photophone, one for the phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for \"hydroairplanes\", and two for selenium cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding alternative fuels."]}, {"page": "Giller Prize", "response": ["* Charlotte Gray"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian writers", "response": ["| scope=\"row\" | Charlotte Gray"]}, {"page": "1998 in literature", "response": ["*Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction: Charlotte Gray: Mrs. KingFaculty of Arts, 1998, Edna Staebler Award , Wilfrid Laurier University, previous winners, Charlotte Gray, Retrieved 11/24/2012"]}, {"page": "1997 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Gray \u2013 Mrs. King"]}, {"page": "1998 Governor General's Awards", "response": ["*Charlotte Gray, Mrs. King: The Life and Times of Isabel Mackenzie King"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian historians", "response": ["*Charlotte Gray, popular histories"]}, {"page": "Frank Pickersgill", "response": ["** In 2004, two of his letters sent to his family from Central Europe in 1939 were published by Charlotte Gray in Canada: A Portrait in Letters."]}, {"page": "Shaughnessy Cohen", "response": ["In the House the following day, MPs from all parties spoke in tribute to Cohen.

The area of Toronto that the newspapers were mostly concerned was an impoverished district known as \"the Ward\" that was bordered by College, Jarvis, University and Yonge streets. \"The Ward\"  was mostly inhabited by Italian, Jewish, Finnish, Polish, West Indian and Chinese immigrants that was painted in lurid terms by the newspapers as a center of organized crime add depravity in general that was threatening society.
