In 1921, Porte wrote that it contains music that is \"remarkably fresh, melodious and thoroughly individual in character and outlook. The vocal and instrumental writing is done with consummate skill.\"Porte, p. 107 Burton praises Much Ado About Nothing, judging it to contain some of Stanford's best operatic music. He rates the last of the composer's operas, The Travelling Companion as his finest operatic achievement, though Burton credits much of its power to the brilliant story adapted by Henry Newbolt from Hans Andersen. Porte writes that the music is often solemn and romantic, and curiously impressive.Porte, p. 111 Christopher Webber writes that it has \"an atmosphere not quite like any other: The Travelling Companion has timeless qualities ...
