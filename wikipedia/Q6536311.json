He started his career with West Bromwich Albion, whom he joined as an amateur in November 1920. In March 1921, Bedford signed professional terms with the club but made only three senior appearances for the side before joining Walsall in 1922. In the first of four spells with Walsall, Bedford played 97 league matches before joining Sheffield Wednesday in August 1925 for a transfer fee of \u00a3575 (\u00a333,000 as of 2021). He scored 2 goals in 11 appearances for the Hillsborough outfit as they won the Football League Second Division at the end of the 1925\u201326 campaign.\nIn the summer of 1926, Bedford returned to Walsall for a fee of \u00a3200 (\u00a311,000 as of 2021). He played a total of 26 matches and scored 3 goals for the side before moving to Football League Third Division North rivals Nelson midway through the season. He made his Nelson debut on 12 March 1927, scoring twice in the 7\u20130 victory away at Accrington Stanley. Bedford kept his place in the team for the remainder of the campaign, and added to his goal tally with strikes against Barrow and Chesterfield. He remained the club's first-choice outside left going into the 1927\u201328 season and scored the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win away at Southport on 17 September. Bedford lost his starting berth following the 1\u20139 defeat to Bradford City, Nelson's heaviest defeat during their ten seasons in the Football League, on 12 November 1927. He was recalled to the side three matches later, and scored his last Nelson goal in the 1\u20131 draw with Tranmere Rovers on 27 December. His last appearance for the Seedhill club came two games later, in the 1\u20136 loss to Crewe Alexandra on 1 January 1928.The following month, Bedford returned to Walsall for a third spell with the club. His stay was short however, as he scored once in 16 league matches before moving to Luton Town two months later. While at Luton, he played alongside fellow former Nelson players John Black and Harry Abbott, and enjoyed the most prolific goal-scoring period of his professional career, netting 15 goals in 49 appearances for the Bedfordshire club. In December 1929, he moved back to Walsall for a fourth and final time, but did not feature regularly for the first team. He was restricted to six league matches before leaving in 1931 to move into non-league football with the Bloxwich Strollers. Bedford went on to play amateur football until the age of 40, eventually retiring in June 1940 following a spell with Walsall Wood. After football, he worked as a foreman for a mineral water company.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Keers", "response": ["Keers spent five months with Annfield Plain before moving to Football League Third Division North club Nelson for a transfer fee of \u00a3150 in December 1926. He was signed to replace Edwin Earle, who had recently been transferred to Burnley for a four-figure sum. Keers made his Nelson debut on 1 January 1927 in the 3\u20130 win against Wrexham at Seedhill. The local newspaper, the Nelson Leader, was pleased with his first performance for the club and he kept his place in the team for the following match against Stockport County. He scored in a 6\u20131 victory for Nelson, before netting again in the 4\u20130 defeat of Wigan Borough a week later. Keers scored his third goal for the club in the 3\u20132 win away at Rotherham United on 5 February 1927. He played a total of eight matches for Nelson, with the team winning six of those games. In March 1927, Nelson signed outside-left Lewis Bedford from Walsall and Keers found himself out of the team. He was released in the summer of 1927 and joined Boston Town, where he spent the following two seasons. Keers signed for Hyde United in 1929 and played for the club until his retirement in 1938."]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Lewis Bedford"]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Lewis Bedford"]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 1966", "response": ["* Lewis Bedford, English footballer (b. 1899)"]}, {"page": "Lewis Bedford", "response": ["Lewis Bedford may refer to:", "* Lewis Bedford (footballer)", "* Lewis Bedford (cricketer)"]}]}}
