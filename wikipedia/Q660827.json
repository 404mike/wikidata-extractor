During this time she held several parliamentary and ministerial positions.\nIn the decade before entering Parliament she played a major part in transformation of the Labour Party, firstly by making members more aware of their visual impact on voters and secondly by co-founding and running two organisations, Labour Women's Network and Emily's List UK, which spearheaded reforms that helped Labour to return a record 101 women to Parliament in 1997.\nFollowing the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal, she repaid more than \u00a342,000 which she had claimed in expenses - which enabled her to top the list of repayments made by MPs. She stood down in 2010 in order to take over the running the business of her husband, author Ken Follett.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 25", "response": ["*  1942   \u2013 Barbara Follett, English politician"]}, {"page": "Ken Follett", "response": ["He has also donated \u00a325,000 to the Yvette Cooper campaign in the 2015 Labour Party (UK) leadership election, as well as another \u00a325,000 from his wife Barbara Follett"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Barbara Follett", "| Barbara Follett"]}, {"page": "Cheyne Walk", "response": ["* Novelist Ken Follett and his wife, the politician Barbara Follett, lived here."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Barbara Follett"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Soames", "response": ["According to the book Women in Parliament published in 2005, Soames has been named as the most prolific source of vulgar and sexist comments in the Houses of Parliament, with several female MPs stating that he has made vulgar comments to them.
