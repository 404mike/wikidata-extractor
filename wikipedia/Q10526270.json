Morley also played cricket for Derbyshire in the summer months.\nIn September 1888 Morley signed for Nottingham Forest, but, he did not stay there long. Within three months he was back at Notts County and making his Football League debut.Morley played two League matches for Notts County and when he played his team scored two goals (out of 40) and conceded five out of 73 goals. The 40 goals was the joint third lowest tally by any League club that season. The 73 goals conceded was the worst by any League club in 1888\u201389. Notts County finished 11th and had to seek re-election.As March 1889 arrived, Archibald Ferguson was unavailable so Morley switched back to left-back for the visit of Burnley. This was Morley's League debut for Derby County. The game was fiercely contested and both defences played well. Lewis Cooper got the crucial winning goal in the 70th minute to enable Derby County to win 1\u20130.Morley kept his place for four League matches, even when in the fourth match at Stoke, when Archibald Ferguson returned to the team, Morley kept his left-back spot. However, he was left out, or injured, for the last game of the season at Blackburn Rovers. He played four League games for Derby County, all at left-back and achieved one clean-sheet. He also played in both of Derby County' FA Cup ties, once at left-back and once at right-back, keeping one clean-sheet.\nDerby County finished 10th and conceded 61 goals in 22 games, the third worst defence of the season. Also Derby County went out of the FA Cup in the second round.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1890 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||||Haydn Morley (Captain)"]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Haydn Morley"]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Haydn Morley"]}]}}
