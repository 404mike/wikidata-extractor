Throughout the early 19th century lascars visited Britain at a rate of 1,000 every year, which increased to a rate of 10,000 to 12,000 every year throughout the late 19th century. A prominent English convert of the 19th century was Henry Stanley, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley, who became a Muslim in 1862. Although not a convert himself, the Victorian Age adventurer, Sir Richard Francis Burton visited Mecca in disguise, documented in The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night. At the beginning of World War I, there were 51,616 South Asian lascars working on British ships, the majority of whom were of Bengali descent.

Their initial intention had been to demolish the hall, but they then decided to live in it.  In 1873 Mond and his family moved into the newer wing of the hall and later that year the Brunners moved into the older wing.  The roughcast was removed from the older part, much of the timber was replaced, and the attic floor was abandoned.  In all, \u00a32,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 as of ), was spent on repairs to the old wing.  The Brunners moved out of the house in 1891 and the Monds at a later date.  After the First World War the building was converted for use as the Winnington Hall Club for the use of the staff of Brunner Mond, (later Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)). This included adding rooms to the northeast of the older wing, and building kitchens and utility rooms to the north of the new wing. The building was restored in about 1920 by Darcy Braddell, who was responsible for much of the current internal decoration.
