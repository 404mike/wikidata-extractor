The Atkinson cycle engines were named the \"Differential 1882\", \"Cycle 1887\" and \"Utilite 1892\". The most well-known of Atkinson's engines is the \"Cycle 1887\", patented in 1887. By use of variable engine strokes from a complex crankshaft, Atkinson was able to increase the efficiency of his engine, at the cost of some power, over traditional Otto-cycle engines.  He was awarded the John Scott Medal of The Franklin Institute in 1889.", "link_mentions": {}}}
