He was a right-handed batsman and a wicket-keeper. A curiosity of his county career is that his highest career score (116) was scored twice, one playing for Glamorgan, and once playing against Glamorgan.\nBefore the Second World War, Brierley played his county cricket for Glamorgan. After the war he moved to play for Lancashire playing for three seasons before emigrating to Canada. He took up posts as a coach with Vancouver Cricket Club, and as groundsman and economics teacher at Shawnigan Lake School.\nHe was considered to be one of the leading cricket coaches in Canada, and continued playing, winning a place in the Canadian national team. He played five further first-class matches for Canada in the 1950s, including a return to the UK in 1954 as part of a Canadian touring team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shawnigan Lake School", "response": ["*Tom Brierley \u2013 Cricketer"]}, {"page": "Vernon Grimshaw", "response": ["He took only two first-class wickets, one each in successive matches in 1936.

They lost only once (to Somerset) but drew ten and tied one. They were well served by their openers Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place who both scored more than 2,000 runs in all first-class matches, Washbrook playing in all five Tests and Place being selected for the West Indies tour. There were problems in the middle order where only Geoff Edrich performed consistently well, but the two Test all-rounders, Jack Ikin and captain Ken Cranston scored over 1,000 runs. Lancashire's outstanding bowler was paceman Dick Pollard who finished the season strongly after an indifferent early phase and took 144 wickets in all matches. Slow left armer William Roberts bowled steadily and took 74 championship wickets but Playfair remarked that he was short of Test class. As with the batting, the all-rounders Cranston and Ikin shored up the bowling with 56 and 48 championship wickets respectively. Looking to the future, Lancashire made a \"find\" in wicketkeeper Alfred Barlow and there were good reports of Alan Wharton who became a Lancashire stalwart for many seasons. Batsman Barry Howard played some good innings in his debut season and, along with Cranston, was awarded his county cap. Other players included future county captain Nigel Howard, Tom Brierley, Phil King in his final season, future Test umpire Eddie Phillipson, Eric Price, and Gordon Garlick who joined Northamptonshire in 1948.Playfair, pp. 87\u201388."]}, {"page": "Canadian cricket tours of England", "response": ["In the 1954 season, the Canadians played 15 matches in all, and four of them were first-class.  Overall, they won four and lost three but in the four first-class matches they could only manage two draws and two defeats. Rain affected many matches on the tour. Prominent members of the team included Jimmy Cameron, who had played Test cricket for the West Indies in 1948\u201349 and Kenneth Trestrail, who had toured with the 1950 West Indies team in England, without playing Tests.
