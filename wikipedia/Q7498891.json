She moved to television and specialized in religious programming.\nShe resigned from the BBC in 1978, and started to work as an author. Her biographical subjects tend to be individuals who have taken a spiritual journey of their own, and whose subsequent influence has been important.\nShe was married to the former Jesuit priest and columnist for The Tablet, John Harriott, until his death at the end of 1990.\nHer interests include psychology, music, walking, gardening and meditation.  She is a patron of the Prison Phoenix Trust and a Trustee of the Oxford Zendo.\nHer books have been translated into French, Japanese, German, Italian, Dutch and Polish.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bede Griffiths", "response": ["* Shirley du Boulay, Beyond the Darkness: A Biography of Bede Griffiths, Alresford, UK: O Books, 2003. ."]}, {"page": "Desmond Tutu", "response": ["Tutu entered the Johannesburg Bantu High School in 1945, where he excelled academically. There, he joined a school rugby team, developing a lifelong love of the sport. Outside of school, he earned money selling oranges and as a caddie for white golfers. To avoid the expense of a daily train commute to school, he briefly lived with family nearer to Johannesburg, before moving back in with his parents when they relocated to Munsieville. He then returned to Johannesburg, moving into an Anglican hostel near the Church of Christ the King in Sophiatown. He became a server at the church and came under the influence of its priest, Trevor Huddleston; later biographer Shirley du Boulay suggested that Huddleston was \"the greatest single influence\" in Tutu's life. The first time he met Huddleston, the radical white priest doffed his hat to Tutu's mother, a gesture almost unheard of in apartheid South Africa. In 1947, Tutu contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalised in Rietfontein for 18 months, during which he was regularly visited by Huddleston. In the hospital, he underwent circumcision to mark his transition to manhood. He returned to school in 1949 and took his national exams in late 1950, gaining a second-class pass."]}, {"page": "Du Boulay", "response": ["* Shirley du Boulay (born 1933), British author and biographer"]}, {"page": "The Prison Phoenix Trust", "response": ["* Shirley du Boulay"]}]}}
