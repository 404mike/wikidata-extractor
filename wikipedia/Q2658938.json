Private operators added to the routes, and an established \"turnpike\" road system started in the 1730s. In 1715 the Irish Parliament took steps to encourage inland navigation, but it was not until 1779 that the first 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) section of the Grand Canal was opened. The addition of the Royal Canal and river navigation (particularly on the River Shannon) meant that freight could be transported more easily. Charles Bianconi established his horse-car services in the south in 1815, the first of many such passenger-carrying operations. Despite these improvements huge areas of Ireland still relied on a basic road system; turnpikes were still slow and canals were expensive."]}, {"page": "Galbally, County Limerick", "response": ["In the centre of Galbally's village square is a statue of a soldier, erected in memory of named local volunteers who lost their lives during the War of Independence in 1921.

It is not listed on either Herman Moll's 1714 map of Ireland, nor is it depicted in Taylor and Skinner's Maps of the Roads of Ireland, published in 1778. While New Inn does not appear to have existed in the 18th century, the road now known as the R639 between Cashel and Cahir clearly did.Taylor and Skinner's Maps of the Roads of Ireland (Dublin, 1778) At that time the R639 was not the main Dublin to Cork route (it did not exist north of Cashel until 1739, nor south of Cahir to Fermoy until after 1811).J.H Andrews, Shapes of Ireland : Maps and Their Makers, 1564\u20131839 (Dublin, 1997), p. 269.

Bassett's 1889 directory of County Tipperary listed the village, noting that it had six houses. Some people believe that the placename may have been derived from a public house of the same name. However, although there is currently a hotel called the Horse and Jockey, in the mid-20th Century the only public house in the village, from which the current hotel was subsequently developed, was known simply as O'Keeffe's, after the family which owned it. Another tentative suggestion is that, since the village was on a mail coach route, it may have been the location of one of the Bianconi Inns established by the transport magnate, Charles Bianconi, and that the name may be somehow connected with such an establishment, if it existed. If there was such an inn, it may what is indicated by the use of italics in the rendering of the name The Horse and Jockey on a 19th-century map in the Ordnance Survey First Edition 6\" Series.

The average length of a turnpike road was 30 miles\". Routes to and from Dublin were developed initially and the network spread throughout the country. Turnpikes operated between 1729 and 1858 when the extensive railway network made them increasingly unpopular. Turnpike roads were not as widely used in Ireland as they were in England because of the availability of toll-free alternatives, the roads built under the presentment system. Lack of traffic on some routes led to reduced toll income and maintenance was neglected. However, in the first quarter of the 19th century, mail-coach contracts increased income and the quality of turnpike roads improved. Turnpike roads were also used by horse-drawn carriage services, including the Bianconi coaches, established as a form of public transport by Charles Bianconi in 1815. By 1820, there were around 1,500 miles of turnpike roads in Ireland but this had fallen to 300 miles by 1856 when competition from the railways made many turnpike roads unprofitable. By 1858, turnpike roads in Ireland had been abolished."]}, {"page": "Ellen Fitzsimon", "response": ["*Ellen \"Eily\" O'Connell Fitzsimon (25 January 1838-1919), married Charles Bianconi jnr, son of Charles Bianconi"]}, {"page": "O'Gorman Coach Builders", "response": ["The administrative offices of O'Gormans were situated over the shop front show room, garage at 36 & 37 Parnell Street (next to Hearns Hotel, where Charles Bianconi established his horse-drawn coach travel empire, 90 years earlier)."]}, {"page": "Carlo Bianconi", "response": ["*Myers claims Giovanni Ludovico was Carlo's father.
