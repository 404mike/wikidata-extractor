He has been a leading figure in the global open knowledge and open data movements, starting with his founding in 2004 of the non-profit Open Knowledge Foundation which he led until 2015. From 2007-2010 he was the Mead Fellow in Economics at the University of Cambridge and from 2010-2013 he was a Shuttleworth Foundation fellow. In 2012 was appointed an Ashoka Fellow and remains an Associate of the Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Law at the University of Cambridge and continues to serve on the board of Open Knowledge International. Since leaving Open Knowledge International, his work has moved to focus more on broader issues of social transformation and in 2016 he co-founded a new non-profit \"Life Itself\". However, he has continued to work actively on the economics and politics of the information age, including publishing \"The Open Revolution: Rewriting the Rules of the Information Age\" in 2018.In addition to his academic work, whilst at Open Knowledge International he initiated a wide variety of projects, many of which continue to be active today. For example, in 2005 he created The Open Definition which provided the first formal definition of open content and open data, and which has remained the standard reference definition. In 2005\u20132006 he created the first version of CKAN, open source software for finding and sharing datasets, especially open datasets. CKAN has continued to evolve and today is the leading open data platform software in the world used by governments including the US and UK to publish millions of public datasets.\nHe also helped to lead or co-found several other organizations including Open Rights Group (2005, co-founder and board member), Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (2005-6, UK director), Creative Commons UK, Datopian (founder) and Life Itself (co-founder).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Remix culture", "response": ["Under copyright laws of many countries, anyone with the intent to remix an existing work is liable for lawsuit because the laws protect the intellectual property of the work. However, current copyright laws are proving to be ineffective at preventing sampling of content.Is Sampling Always Copyright Infringement? by Tomasz Rychlicki and Adam Zieli\u0144ski (November 2009) On the other hand, fair-use does not address a wide enough range of use-cases and its borders are not well established and defined, making usage under \"fair use\" legally risky. Lessig argues that there needs to be a change in the current state of copyright laws to legalize remix culture, especially for fair-use cases. He states that \"outdated copyright laws have turned our children into criminals.\" One proposition is to adopt the system of citation used with book references. The artist would cite the intellectual property she sampled which would give the original creator the credit, as is common with literature references. As tools for doing so Lawrence Lessig proposed the Creative Commons licenses which demand for instance Attribution without restricting the general use of a creative work. One step further is the Free content movement, which proposes that creative content should be released under free licenses. The Copyright reform movement tries to tackle the problem by cutting for instance the excessively long copyright terms, as it was debated by scholar Rufus Pollock."]}, {"page": "Rufus", "response": ["* Rufus Pollock (born 1980), English economist"]}, {"page": "Open Rights Group", "response": ["thumb|right|200px|Open Rights Group posterThe organisation was started by Danny O'Brien, Cory Doctorow, Ian Brown, Rufus Pollock, James Cronin, Stefan Magdalinski, Louise Ferguson and Suw Charman after a panel discussion at Open Tech 2005.Open Tech 2005 schedule , 23 July 2005 O'Brien created a pledge on PledgeBank, placed on 23 July 2005, with a deadline of 25 December 2005: \"I will create a standing order of 5 pounds per month to support an organisation that will campaign for digital rights in the UK but only if 1,000 other people will too.\" The pledge reached 1000 people on 29 November 2005.www.pledgebank.com/rights , 23 July 2005 \u2013 25 December 2005Getting out more , Danny O'Brien's blog post floating the idea and advertising the pledge The Open Rights Group was launched at a \"sell-out\" meeting in Soho, London.ORG digital rights event update , Open Rights Group blog, 29 November 2005Invitation to attend \u2018Digital Rights in the UK: Your Rights, Your Issues\u2019 , Open Rights Group blog, 16 November 2005"]}, {"page": "Shuttleworth Foundation", "response": ["Notable past and present fellows include Marcin Jakubowski (who develops the Open Source Ecology project), Rufus Pollock (co-founder of the Open Knowledge Foundation Retrieved 2012-12-13) and Mark Surman (now Executive Director of Mozilla Foundation.)"]}, {"page": "Raw data", "response": ["Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web) argues that sharing raw data is important for society.  Inspired by a post by Rufus Pollock of the Open Knowledge Foundation his call to action is \"Raw Data Now\", meaning that everyone should demand that governments and businesses share the data they collect as raw data. He points out that \"data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives\u2026 because somebody takes the data and does something with it.\" To Berners-Lee, it is essentially from this sharing of raw data, that advances in science will emerge. Advocates of open data argue that once citizens and civil society organizations have access to data from businesses and governments, it will enable citizens and NGOs to do their own analysis of the data, which can empower people and civil society. For example, a government may claim that its policies are reducing the unemployment rate, but a poverty advocacy group may be able to have its staff econometricians do their own analysis of the raw data, which may lead this group to draw different conclusions about the data set.", "* Give Us the Data Raw, and Give it to Us Now - the blog post from Rufus Pollock that inspired Tim Berners-Lee"]}, {"page": "Open Knowledge Foundation", "response": ["Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF) is a global, non-profit network that promotes and shares information at no charge, including both content and data.
