He studied at Anglia Ruskin University. He painted the cover art for the first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Due to the number of questions regarding the identity of the wizard illustrated on the back cover of the first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and thanks to the contribution of an Argentine named Alfonso Ferrer in Taylor's blog, in February 2016, he decided to name him Robertus Tallis.He attended the Norwich School of Art and Design. Then he spent three years at art school in Cambridge. After finishing his education he found his first job at Heffer\u2019s Children\u2019s Bookshop. In his spare time he was looking for something that was close to his desires - book illustrations. And in about a year he was offered to do a book cover by Bloomsbury Publishing. It happened to be the first book by J. K. Rowling about Harry Potter. And along with books illustrations he began writing books for children by himself and soon found out that it was much of his interest and really a work that he was always dreaming about. And his childhood desire to see ghosts' world at last could be realized in writing books, because everything is possible in stories. That is how he lived his idea in Haunters, his \"first novel for early teens\".He has written and illustrated several picture books, starting with George and Sophie's Museum Adventure in 1999, and has two children's novels, Haunters and Dan of the Dead.  The first one eas published in May, 2012 by The Chicken House and the last one was published on 1 June 2012 by  Bloomsbury Publishing PLC. Dan of the Dead sequel named Dan and the Caverns of Bone was issued in June, 2013. The book The Pets You Get with his illustrations won the Stockport Schools\u2019 Book Award in 2013 (early years category) and also the Oldham Brilliant Books Award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "response": ["In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries. Her original name, \"Joanne Rowling\", can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to \"Joanne\" completely.) The short initial print run was standard for first novels, and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers. Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction. Thomas Taylor created the cover for the first edition."]}, {"page": "Harry Potter", "response": ["For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design, with the first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font Cochin Bold. The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft."]}, {"page": "Thomas Taylor", "response": ["Thomas Taylor may refer to:", "*Thomas Taylor (Medal of Honor) (born 1834), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*Sir Thomas Taylor, 2nd Baronet (1657\u20131696), English MP for Maidstone", "*Sir Thomas Taylor, 1st Baronet (1662\u20131736), Anglo-Irish MP", "*Sir Thomas Taylor, 2nd Baronet, of Kells (1686\u20131757), Anglo-Irish MP", "*Thomas Taylor (Liberal politician) (1851\u20131916), British Liberal Party politician, MP for Bolton, 1912\u20131916", "*Thomas Taylor (Canadian politician) (1865\u20131947), politician in British Columbia, Canada", "*Thomas Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gryfe (1912\u20132001), British politician", "*Thomas Taylor, Baron Taylor of Blackburn (1929\u20132016), British life peer", "*Thomas Taylor (Australian politician), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "*Thomas Taylor (Archdeacon of Ardagh), 18th-century Anglican priest in Ireland", "*Thomas Taylor (historian) (1858\u20131938), priest, historian and scholar of Celtic culture", "*Thomas Taylor (minister) (1738\u20131816), English Wesleyan minister and writer", "*Thomas Taylor (priest, 1576\u20131632), English Puritan", "*Thomas Taylor (priest, 1757\u20131808), Archdeacon of Chichester", "*Thomas Taylor (cricketer, born 1753) (1753\u20131806), English cricketer", "*Thomas Taylor (cricketer, born 1823), English cricketer", "*Tommy Taylor (Irish footballer), real name Thomas Taylor, Irish international footballer", "*Thomas Taylor (rugby league) (1911\u20131992), rugby league footballer of the 1930s and 1940s for England, Yorkshire, and Castleford", "*Thomas Taylor (weightlifter) (born 1899), British Olympic weightlifter", "*Thomas Taylor (architect) (1777/78\u20131826), English artist and architect", "*Thomas Taylor (Australian architect) (19th century), Brisbane architect, designed the Wenley House", "*Thomas Taylor (artist) (born 1973), British children's author and illustrator", "*Thomas Taylor (botanist) (1786\u20131848), botanical author", "*Sir Thomas Taylor (chemist) (1895\u20131953), English chemist and university administrator", "*Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist) (1758\u20131835), English translator and Neoplatonist"]}]}}
