In the semi-final against Leicestershire, Gazzard impressed with his excellent glovework making two key stumpings and a run out, also he hit 16 off the penultimate over therefore receiving the man of the match award. A poor start to the 2006 season in which he scored only 305 first-class runs at 15.25 in thirteen matches led to him being dropped from the Somerset first team for Sam Spurway to take his place."]}, {"page": "Mike Burns (cricketer)", "response": ["Towards the end of the 1996 season, Warwickshire's captain Dermot Reeve was forced to retire with a chronic hip injury. He moved to Somerset in 1997, where he took on the role of team coach; Burns followed him soon after. Somerset did not have a vacancy for a wicket-keeper; in 1997, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described Robert Turner as top-class. As a result, Burns focussed on his batting, particularly in one-day cricket, and also developed as an occasional medium-pace bowler. He played significantly more cricket in 1997 than in any year previously; in first-class cricket he maintained his average from the previous year, scoring 510 runs at 25.50, and in one-day cricket he scored his maiden century in top-level cricket. Having never scored more than 48 runs in a List A match prior to 1997, Burns scored five half-centuries in addition to the 115 not out that he hit against Middlesex in September. His average of 31.35 in List A cricket that year was the highest of any season during his career, and Wisden judged that he had \"made a good impression\" in the season. As a bowler, Burns took almost a third of his List A wickets during 1997, claiming 18 at a bowling average of 24.77, while in the first-class game he was used more sparingly, and took 5 wickets at 53.20."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Robert Turner (1991\u20132005) 211 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Robert Turner", "response": ["*Robert Turner (composer) (1920\u20132012), Canadian composer", "*Robert Levon Been (born 1978), a.k.a.

Following his dismissal captain Andy Hayhurst and wicket-keeper Robert Turner shared a fifth wicket stand of 100 which was ended shortly before the close. Hayhurst completed a slow-paced century on the second day, before afternoon showers led to the hosts\u2019 declaration. The wickets were shared amongst the Warwickshire bowlers but Richard Davis did take five catches, one short of a county fielding record. Warwickshire closed on 57 without loss. The third day witnessed no play because of rain so to generate a result both teams declared early on the final day leaving Warwickshire a fourth innings target of 321 from 95 overs. They were well placed on 87/1 at lunch but rain returned to wash out the afternoon session leaving the visitors 33 overs to score the 234 more needed to win. Brian Lara set about the unlikely chase by sharing partnerships of 74 in 9 overs with Paul Smith and then 126 in 14 overs with Asif Din. Lara reached his century, his fifth in consecutive innings, off 72 balls and was dismissed for 136 off 94.
