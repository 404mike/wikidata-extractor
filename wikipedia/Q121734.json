According to the historian Alessandro Barbero, Picton was \"respected for his courage and feared for his irascible temperament\". The Duke of Wellington called him \"a rough foul-mouthed devil as ever lived\", but found him capable.\nPicton came to public attention initially for his alleged cruelty during his governorship (1797\u20131803) of Trinidad, as a result of which he was put on trial in England for approving the illegal torture of a 14-year-old girl, Luisa Calder\u00f3n. Though initially convicted, Picton later had the conviction overturned arguing that Trinidad was subject to Spanish law, which permitted the use of torture. Controversy over the torture and Picton's role in the colonial slave trade continued. In 2020, Cardiff council voted to remove Picton's statue in the \"Heroes of Wales\" gallery in Cardiff City Hall.He is chiefly remembered for his exploits under Wellington in the Iberian Peninsular War of 1807\u20131814, during which he fought in many engagements, displaying great bravery and persistence. He was killed in 1815 fighting at the Battle of Waterloo, during a crucial bayonet charge in which his division stopped d'Erlon's corps' attack against the allied centre left.
