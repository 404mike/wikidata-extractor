He was the author of several well-known books about writing systems.\nOn the back dust-jacket flap of Writing (1962), under About the Author, we may read the following brief biography of the author as scholar: \"David Diringer, M.A. (Cantab.), D.Litt. (Florence), was educated in Florence, to which University he subsequently returned, first as Lecturer, then as Professor. He has taught [...] in England, on the Continent, in the [US], and elsewhere. He was Secretary at the First International Congress of Etruscan Studies (1928) and at the first three Congresses of Colonial Studies in Italy (1931, 1934, 1937). Since 1948, Dr. Diringer has been Lecturer in Semitic Epigraphy at the University of Cambridge. He is the author of several books, including The Early Hebrew Inscriptions (1934) [and] The Alphabet in the History of Civilization (1937), and of more than 200 contributions to learned journals. Dr. Diringer is the founder and director of the Alphabet Museum at Cambridge.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abugida", "response": ["Related concepts were introduced independently in 1948 by James Germain F\u00e9vrier (using the term ) and David Diringer (using the term semisyllabary), then in 1959 by Fred Householder (introducing the term pseudo-alphabet).Householder, F.

Fundamentals of Grammatology. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 110(4), 727-731. doi:10.2307/602899: \"We must recognize that the West Semitic scripts constitute a third fundamental type of script, the kind that denotes individual consonants only. It cannot be subsumed under either of the other terms. A suitable name for this type would be \"alephbeth,\" in honor of its Levantine origin, but this term seems too similar to \"alphabet\" to be practical; so I propose to call this type an \"abjad,\" [Footnote:  I.e., the alif-ba-jim order familiar from earlier Semitic alphabets, from which the modern order alif-ba-ta-tha is derived by placing together the letters with similar shapes and differing numbers of dots. The abjad is the order in which numerical values are assigned to the letters (as in Hebrew).] from the Arabic word for the traditional order6 of its script, which (unvocalized) of course falls in this category... There is yet a fourth fundamental type of script, a type recognized over forty years ago by James-Germain Fevrier, called by him the \"neosyllabary\" (1948, 330), and again by Fred Householder thirty years ago, who called it \"pseudo-alphabet\" (1959, 382). These are the scripts of Ethiopia and \"greater India\" that use a basic form for the specific syllable consonant + a particular vowel (in practice always the unmarked a) and modify it to denote the syllables with other vowels or with no vowel. Were it not for this existing term, I would propose maintaining the pattern by calling this type an \"abugida,\" from the Ethiopian word for the auxiliary order of consonants in the signary.\" In 1992 Faber suggested \"segmentally coded syllabically linear phonographic script\", and in 1992 Bright used the term alphasyllabary,Amalia E. Gnanadesikan (2017) Towards a typology of phonemic scripts, Writing Systems Research, 9:1, 14-35, DOI: 10.1080/17586801.2017.1308239 \"The second is that of Bright (1996, 1999) which follows Daniels in abjads and alphabets (Bright, 1999), but identifies instead of abugidas a category of alphasyllabaries. As Bright (1999) points out, the definition of abugida and the definition of alpha- syllabary differ. This fact alone suggests that at least one of the two classifications is either incom- plete or inaccurate\u2014or at the very least that they have two different purposes. This paper is intended as a (long-delayed) response to Bright (1999) and argues that both of these systems are in fact incomplete.\"Littera ex occidente: Toward a Functional History of Writing. Peter T. Daniels, in STUDIES IN SEMITIC AND AFROASIATIC LINGUISTICS PRESENTED TO GENE B. GRAGG Edited by CYNTHIA L. MILLER pages 53-69:\"Alongside the terms I rejected (neosyllabary [F\u00e9vrier 1948], pseudo-alphabet [Householder 1959], semisyllabary [Diringer 1948], and alphasyllabary [Bright 1992]) because they imply exactly the notion I am trying to refute \u2013 that the abugida is a kind of alphabet or a kind of syllabary \u2013 I have just come across semialphabet in the Encyclop\u0153dia Britannica Microp\u0153dia (though what is intended by the distinction \"the syllabic Kharo\u0153\u00f8\u00cf (sic) and semialphabetic Br\u03a9hm\u00cf\" [s.v. \"Indic Writing Systems\"] is unfathomable). W. Bright denies having devised the term alphasyllabary, but it has not yet been found to occur earlier than his 1992 encyclopedia (in 1990: 136 he approved semisyllabary). Compare Daniels 1996b: 4 n. * and Bright 2000 for the different conceptualizations of abugida and alphasyllabary: functional vs. formal, as it happens. The words abjad and abugida are simply words in Arabic and Ethiopic, respectively, for the ancient Northwest Semitic order of letters, which is used in those languages in certain functions alongside the customary orders (in Arabic reflecting rearrangement according to shape, and in Ethiopic reflecting an entirely different letter-order tradition\" and Gnanadesikan and Rimzhim, Katz, & Fowler have suggested aksara or \u0101ksharik.Amalia E.

David Diringer noted that \"the first mention of Egyptian documents written on leather goes back to the Fourth Dynasty (c. 2550\u20132450 BC), but the earliest of such documents extant are: a fragmentary roll of leather of the Sixth Dynasty (c. 24th century BC), unrolled by Dr. H. Ibscher, and preserved in the Cairo Museum; a roll of the Twelfth Dynasty (c. 1990\u20131777 BC) now in Berlin; the mathematical text now in the British Museum (MS. 10250); and a document of the reign of Ramses II (early thirteenth century BC).\"David Diringer, The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental, Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 172. Though the Assyrians and the Babylonians impressed their cuneiform on clay tablets, they also wrote on parchment from the 6th century BC onward. Rabbinic literature traditionally maintains that the institution of employing parchment made of animal hides for the writing of ritual objects such as the Torah, mezuzah, and tefillin is Sinaitic in origin, with special designations for different types of parchment such as gevil and klaf.Maimonides, Hilkhoth Tefillin 1:3."]}, {"page": "Papyrus", "response": ["Papyrus was replaced in Europe by the cheaper, locally produced products parchment and vellum, of significantly higher durability in moist climates, though Henri Pirenne's connection of its disappearance with the Muslim conquest of Egypt is contested.Pirenne, Mohammed and Charlemagne, critiqued by R.S.

The Philippine scripts, according to Diringer, were possibly brought to the Philippines through the Buginese characters in Sulawesi. According to Scott, 's immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of final consonants or vowel canceller markers in . South Sulawesi languages have a restricted inventory of syllable-final consonants and do not represent them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of final consonant markers in  is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and there is evidence of trade routes between the two.  must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.Caldwell, Ian. 1988.
