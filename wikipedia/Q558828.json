Born in Wiveliscombe, Somerset, she began her career in repertory in Birmingham in the 1950s moving from there to the Dundee Rep.\nHer petite build and distinctively deep-set eyes saw her frequently typecast as a stereotypically dotty or timid and mouse-like spinster. She nonetheless appeared in a wide range of roles, including the television series Dr Finlay's Casebook, Emmerdale Farm where she played an aunt of publican and newspaper correspondent Amos Brearly, Fawlty Towers (where she memorably played the Colonel's wife inadvertently served the raw red mullet in \"Gourmet Night\") and Rumpole of the Bailey as Dodo Mackintosh. She also read the Mrs. Pepperpot books on the children's series Jackanory.  She played the vicar's wife in Last of the Summer Wine.\nFilm roles included Carry On Loving (1970), Endless Night (1972) and Clockwise (1986) (in which she sang the Vivian Ellis standard This is my Lovely Day on the soundtrack and made comic use of the repeated line \"Aren't we all such lucky people\") and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969) (where she played the headmistress's secretary, Miss Gaunt). A more unusual role was the 1987 short film Unusual Ground Floor Conversion in which she played an old lady gradually driving her downstairs neighbour mad by throwing water out of her window every few minutes.\nWay died in London in 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["Cleese and Prunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty) were supported by Connie Booth (Polly Sherman) and  Andrew Sachs (Manuel) in the two other major roles, with several actors regularly appearing in further supporting roles including Ballard Berkeley (Major Gowen), Brian Hall (Chef Terry), and Renee Roberts (Miss Gatsby) with Gilly Flower (Miss Tibbs).

Amos's rivalry with Ernie Shuttleworth (John Comer) of the Malt Shovel public house takes on a new intensity, as they try to outdo the other with various ventures, including happy hours, juke boxes and dominoes tournaments. Ernie is thrilled to get Amos a ticking off from the local police by tampering with the Woolpack clock so the pub is caught serving drinks after hours. Amos almost marries Gloria Pinfold (Hope Johnston), an old sweetheart of his from many years before. She is a strong-willed woman who moves into the Woolpack and interferes with Henry's book keeping and the diet of the two men, insisting that full English breakfasts are not to be eaten because of high cholesterol and fat content. Gloria leaves Amos for another man. Amos discovers a crop circle at Home Farm and is convinced that aliens have landed in Beckindale.
