Others included the ultimate non-batsman, Seymour Clark, and the opening batsman Frank Lee. \nPratten played once in the 1930 season in the match against Leicestershire, not batting and taking one catch. In the 1931 season, he played in Somerset's first 10 County Championship matches, plus the match against the New Zealanders, taking in those 11 matches five catches and making five stumpings. At the end of June, Lee took over the wicketkeeping duties, and Pratten did not appear in first-class cricket again. \nHe reached double figures only three times in 18 innings, twice in the match against Nottinghamshire, which Somerset still lost heavily.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Midsomer Norton", "response": ["* Frederick Pratten (1904\u20131967), cricketer "]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Frederick Pratten (1930\u20131931) 12 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Pratten", "response": ["* Frederick Pratten (cricketer) (1904\u20131967), English cricketer"]}]}}
