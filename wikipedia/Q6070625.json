He spent the 2001\u201302 season on loan at Crewe Alexandra, Oldham Athletic, and Halifax Town. He then spent much of the 2002\u201303 season on loan at Swansea City, before he was allowed to join Northampton Town in summer 2003. He scored eleven goals for the club in 2003\u201304, though was sent out on loan to Rochdale in the latter half of the 2004\u201305 campaign after he found himself struggling with injury. He joined Barnsley in August 2005, and went on to score twelve goals in 2005\u201306, helping the club win promotion to the Championship via the play-offs. Released at the end of the 2006\u201307 season, he signed with Port Vale in June 2007. After five goals in 2007\u201308, he became the club's top-scorer for four seasons running with 11 goals in 2008\u201309, 22 goals in 2009\u201310, 20 goals in 2010\u201311, and 17 goals in 2011\u201312. He signed with Chesterfield in May 2012, and played for the club in the 2014 final of the League Trophy, before helping them to win the League Two title in 2013\u201314. He returned to Northampton Town in May 2014, and finished as the club's top-scorer for two consecutive seasons, helping Northampton to win the League Two title in 2015\u201316. He signed with Swindon Town in January 2018 and after one-and-a-half seasons with Swindon moved on to Cambridge United in August 2019. He joined non-League side Yeovil Town in January 2020 and moved on to St Ives Town seven months later.\nOverall, he has scored more than 200 goals in around 700 professional appearances.

He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons.

The following month, on 20 December 2015, Horwood made his return to the first team, where he won a penalty, leading Marc Richards to convert a successful penalty, in a 2\u20131 win over Carlisle United. After his return, he managed to regain his first team place, playing in the left\u2013back, though he appears in an attacking role.

This was followed by a thirteen-game barren spell, which was ended by three goals in four games, including a strike that took the club into the Third Round of the FA Cup. The Richards duo's partnership was ended in January when Marc suffered a thigh injury; upon his recovery Justin was dropped to make way for loan striker Tom Pope. Richards scored his first hat-trick in the English Football League on 30 April, along with Louis Dodds, in a 7\u20132 win over Morecambe.

He was appointed as club captain, after impressing in the pre-season. At twenty one years of age, and new to the club, his appointment came as a surprise to some, especially with more senior options in Sam Stockley, Marc Richards and Gareth Owen. However, Adams had faith in the young midfielder's vocal abilities and general leadership qualities. Putting in solid performances in Vale's unbeaten start to the season, he took to the field despite still suffering with an ankle injury. His first goal for the club seemed to come in a 4\u20130 home win over Grimsby Town on 5 September. However, after the match Marc Richards claimed the last touch and therefore took the credit for the goal. Fraser seemed to attract violence; on 25 August, Sheffield Wednesday's Francis Jeffers was sent off for head-butting Fraser, two weeks later Fraser and Aldershot Town captain John Halls almost came to blows before the match had even begun. He was transfer listed in late September, along with the entire Port Vale squad, after manager Micky Adams saw his team slip to a third consecutive defeat. He remained club captain and a first team regular though, striking up a midfield pairing with Anthony Griffith, who he also shared a house with. His performances as captain earned him public praise from assistant manager Geoff Horsfield, though the fans were critical at times of his inconsistency. He found himself the new focus of disgruntled supporters in early 2010, following Danny Glover's demotion to the reserves, and Marc Richards' rising goal tally. Fraser vowed to ignore the booing.

He returned to Rovers in January, though later in the month he returned to Vale Park on loan until the end of the season, where he and Marc Richards began to develop a lethal strike partnership. In all he scored three goals in 26 appearances for the club.

Acknowledging \"it's a last-chance saloon\", Roberts said \"I've learnt just not to be a plonker for all my life.\" He joined the team on their July pre-season trip to Ireland, as Adams, already convinced of the player's talents, wanted to test Roberts' ability to stay away from his off-the-field demons. Roberts seemed to enjoy a good start to his Vale career, and after Adams' typically relentless pre-season fitness regime he claimed \"I've turned the corner...I think I've got my act together but I've just got to keep living each day as it comes and as long as I wake up clean that's all that I need\". He signed a six-month contract at the end of the month. He started the season well, maintaining discipline off the pitch, and his first team place on it, forging a midfield partnership with Anthony Griffith. As early as September he entered negotiations with the club to extend his contract, and Roberts quickly signed an extended contract to keep him at the club until the end of the season. However Micky Adams left the club in December 2010, and Roberts did not enjoy a happy relationship with new manager Jim Gannon. Gannon dropped him to the bench after Roberts admitted he did not enjoy playing in a more advanced position; Vale fans showed their support for the player by chanting his name throughout a 1\u20130 win over Rotherham. He then picked up a three-match ban after receiving a red card for violent conduct in a reserve match against Nottingham Forest. Gannon defended Roberts, believing the player was unlucky to be dismissed after he responded to a 'reckless' challenge by David Morgan by shoving Morgan to the ground. In March, speculation that he would leave Vale Park at the end of the season (or earlier) increased, as it was reported by BBC Radio Stoke that the club had informed the player he could leave on loan. However Gannon denied this on the club's website, stating that there was \"no substance\" to the report. In fact he went on to say \"he has a huge part to play\" in the club's promotion campaign. His teammates also showed their support for him by celebrating goals with Roberts' celebration style during his absence; club captain Marc Richards also dedicated his two goals against Shrewsbury Town to Roberts.

He managed to battle his way back into the first team and win back his captaincy (from Marc Richards) during the latter part of the 2008\u201309 season.
