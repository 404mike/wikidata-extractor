One of the first modern historians to deal with Richard II as a king and as a person was Bishop Stubbs. Stubbs argued that towards the end of his reign, Richard's mind \"was losing its balance altogether\". Historian Anthony Steel, who wrote a full-scale biography of the king in 1941, took a psychiatric approach to the issue, and concluded that Richard had schizophrenia.Steel (1941), p. 8. This was challenged by V. H. Galbraith, who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis, a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period, such as Anthony Goodman and Anthony Tuck. Nigel Saul, who wrote the most recent academic biography on Richard II, concedes thateven though there is no basis for assuming the king had a mental illnesshe showed clear signs of a narcissistic personality, and towards the end of his reign \"Richard's grasp on reality was becoming weaker\".Saul (1997), pp. 460\u20134."]}, {"page": "Collingwood College, Durham", "response": ["* Anthony Tuck FRHistS (1978\u20131987)'TUCK, Prof. (John) Anthony', Who's Who 2013, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2013; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012 ; online edn, Nov 2012 accessed 5 April 2013"]}, {"page": "Wonderful Parliament", "response": ["Richard II succeeded to the throne in 1377 on the death of his grandfather, Edward III, but his unpopularity had been growing since Richard's suppression of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. He was increasingly criticised for his patronage of a few select royal favourites, to an extent that has been described as \"lavish to the point of foolishness\" by a biographer, historian Anthony Tuck. Parliament was also coming to the view that the King needed to rule as economically as was possible, and they observed with dull eyes the King's distribution of extravagant patronage to a limited circle, the greatest recipient of which was Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk. Furthermore, the Hundred Years' War was going poorly for England. Several expeditions had left for France in the early years of Richard's reign to defend English territory, but they were almost all military and political failures. In spite of these setbacks, parliament faced requests from the King for increased subsidies to pay for the war. The King was also unpopular because of his choice of advisers, particularly de la Pole, the chancellor, who was felt to exert too much influence on foreign policy and so became inextricably linked with its failure. One 20th-century historian, Clementine Oliver, has described de la Pole as a \"staunch loyalist\"; he had been elevated to the peerage as Earl of Suffolk only the previous year, the first of his family to receive a peerage. He advocated making peace overtures to the French. Tuck has argued that, while probably the most sensible policy the government could have adopted, pacificism was unpopular with much of the English nobility, as a martial career such as their fathers had enjoyed was expected to be financially and chivalrically profitable. Some young nobles\u2014such as the Earls of Arundel and Warwick\u2014had \"been kept in good humour since 1376 only by a lavish distribution of Crown perquisites and war salaries\", argues scholar M. V. Clarke\"."]}, {"page": "Tuck (surname)", "response": ["* Anthony Tuck (born 1940), English historian"]}, {"page": "Neville\u2013Neville feud", "response": ["Ralph Neville, the 1st earl of Westmorland (c. 1364\u20131425) married twice. His first wife Margaret Stafford, daughter of the earl of Stafford, died in 1396. Shortly after her death, Ralph Neville married Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt and cousin of King Richard II. They had 9 sons and 5 daughters together: the eldest, Richard Neville, became earl of Salisbury; their second son, William Neville, became earl of Kent and was created Baron Fauconberg; George Neville became the 1st Baron Latimer, Edward Neville was Baron Abergavenny and their youngest, Robert Neville, eventually assumed the office of Bishop of Durham. Historian Anthony Tuck writes that this marriage \"was to have major consequences both for the Neville family and for the English nobility\" throughout the 15th century."]}, {"page": "English invasion of Scotland (1385)", "response": ["As part of their treaty with France, the Scots had reassurances that, were war to break out between Scotland and England, France would provide military assistance for Scotland. Gaunt's attempts at furthering peace between England and Scotland did not suit France at all. They were, says May McKisack, \"eager to profit by England's domestic embarrassments\". A small and somewhat unofficial French force\u2013perhaps in the nature of an advance party\u2013had arrived in Scotland in May 1384. Their arrival followed the fall of Lochmaben Castle, the \"last English outpost along in the western borders\", after its capture by the Scots. The loss of this castle, says Anthony Tuck, left Cumberland \"more vulnerable than it had been for the past fifty years\". It did, however, provide Richard's council with the perfect justification for invading Scotland rather than France."]}, {"page": "Tuck, Anthony", "response": ["#redirectAnthony Tuck"]}]}}
