He was the author of Wooden Ships and Iron Men, a now-classic 1924 book about the last days of the Age of Sail in Maritime Canada. Born in Glasgow, Scotland, he initially worked as a clerk but turned to the sea as a journalist of the fishing industry which later led to historical work. Wallace served in World War I as commander of a Q-Ship. He died in Montreal on July 15, 1958.About forty years later than he preferred to, he said, he published Wooden Ships and Iron Men as a testament to the spirit of the Age of Sail. He followed this book with In the Wake of the Windships and Record of Canadian Shipping. These three historical works became standard references to the deepwater sailing era in Canada. Wallace also wrote the novels Blue Water and Captain Salvation and several other works. Blue Water was made into a film in Canada directed by David Hartford, but it never had a theatrical release. Captain Salvation was purchased the Hearst Corporation and released as a film in 1927, directed by John S. Robertson. Both films were from the silent era.\nHe edited the monthly journal Canadian Fisherman for forty years. This publication, which ran from 1917 to 1970, remains an important source of information for researchers today.He also wrote short stories for such pulp magazines as Adventure between 1912 and 1922 and in 1929 he wrote Bound for the Rio Grande, an operetta based on English shanties, performed at the 1929 CPR Festival in Vancouver. His epic poem about his time aboard the Effie M. Morrissey, \"The Log of the Record Run,\" was widely read and adopted by east coast fishermen with such authentic results that it was mistaken as a very old traditional song by folklorist Helen Creighton.An accomplished photographer, in 2006 he was the subject of a book by Nova Scotia writer M. Brook Taylor entitled A Camera on the Banks, which documents seven voyages to the Newfoundland Grand Banks where he toiled alongside other fishermen, at the same time documenting their condition in photographs and words. In conjunction with the launch of Taylor's book, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic opened an exhibit on June 6, 2006 entitled A Camera on the Banks: The Work of Frederick William Wallace, which displayed part of the museum's extensive collection of Wallace's photographs. Some of these photographs had originally appeared in the National Geographic. The Wallace exhibit has since travelled in Nova Scotia to Lunenburg, Annapolis Royal, Digby and Shelburne. A bilingual version opened at the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa, Ontario on September 17, 2008.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Canadian writers", "response": ["| scope=\"row\" | Frederick William Wallace"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian historians", "response": ["*Frederick William Wallace"]}, {"page": "Digby, Nova Scotia", "response": ["Fishing has been an essential economic activity since the town's settlement.

Starting with the schooner Diadem in 1864, Cox became the master shipbuilder for a series of partnerships which built over 30 vessels of increasing size. Most had names beginning with the letter \"K\" and began known as the \"K Ships\". The shipyard included a large mill and blacksmith and used tugboats to brings rafts of timber from the Cape Blomidon area. The Kingsport yards reached their peak in 1890 with the launch of the four-masted barque Kings County followed by the ship Canada in 1891, two of the largest wooden ships ever built in Canada. Ebenezer Cox was by 1890 regarded to have built more ships than any man in Halifax. The launch of Canada on July 6, 1891 attracted over 5,000 people from all across Western Nova Scotia, brought to Kingsport by multiple special trains on the Cornwallis Valley Railway.\"The Launch\", The Acadian and King's Co.

The yard used the massive Minas Basin tides as a natural drydock into the 1920s repairing such vessels as the American Bradford C.
