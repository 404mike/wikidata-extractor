In 1916, because of his lack of a Fellowship, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914. He later described this as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression, in Free Thought and Official Propaganda. Russell championed the case of Eric Chappelow, a poet jailed and abused as a conscientious objector.Caroline Moorehead, Bertrand Russell: A Life (1992), p. 247. Russell played a significant part in the Leeds Convention in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand \"anti-war socialists\" gather; many being delegates from the Independent Labour Party and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement. The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour Members of Parliament (MPs), including Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden, as well as former Liberal MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor Arnold Lupton. After the event, Russell told Lady Ottoline Morrell that, \"to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody\".", "In 1924, Russell again gained press attention when attending a \"banquet\" in the House of Commons with well-known campaigners, including Arnold Lupton, who had been an MP and had also endured imprisonment for \"passive resistance to military or naval service\"."]}, {"page": "David Lloyd George", "response": ["At the end of the war Lloyd George's reputation stood at its zenith.

His mother was born into the Lupton family, a socially progressive, politically active dynasty of businessmen and traders, long established in Leeds, a city both prosperous and squalid with the rapid growth of the Industrial Revolution.

In 1841 his sister Elizabeth married Jane's brother Arthur (1819\u20131867), also a Unitarian minister; Uncle Arthur was, according to a family history, \"The Achilles of the Leeds Complete Suffrage Association\",Lupton, C.A., The Lupton Family in Leeds, Wm.

In 1893, in the aftermath of the formation of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in neighboring Bradford, he was asked to give a speech for the Cowling Liberal Club on the dangers of socialism. Whilst researching the subject, Snowden instead became convinced by the ideology. He eventually joined the executive committee of the Keighley ILP in 1899, and went on to chair the ILP from 1903 to 1906. He became a prominent speaker for the party, and wrote a popular Christian socialist pamphlet with Keir Hardie in 1903, entitled The Christ that is to Be. His strident rhetoric, well-laced with statistics and evangelical themes, contrasted the evil conditions under capitalism with the moral and economic utopia of future socialism. He condemned as \"bloodsuckers and parasites\" local textile company executives. In 1898, he launched the Keighley Labour Journal, using it to denounce waste, pettiness, and corruption. However, he ignored the concerns of the trade unions, which he judged to be conservative and fixated on wages. By 1902, he had moved his base to Leeds and toured Britain as a lecturer on politics and corruption, with his own syndicated column and short essays in numerous working class outlets. By the time he was elected Labour MP for Blackburn in 1906, he had become a well-known socialist figure, standing at the national level alongside both Keir Hardie, Professor Arnold Lupton and Ramsay MacDonald.Millman, Brock, Domestic Dissent in First World War Britain, 2000, page 186."]}, {"page": "Shirebrook", "response": ["Shirebrook Colliery was sunk in 1896 - 1897 by the Shirebrook Coal and Iron company on land owned by the Duke of Devonshire, Joseph Paget (Pleasley Mills partner and builder of Stuffynwood Hall) and The Nicholson and Fowler Farming families.
