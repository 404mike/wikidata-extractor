First called simply The New Hall, it was soon renamed after its donor, Henry Whitehead, High Sheriff of Lancashire and a descendant of Roger Kay. The hall was opened by Alice Stanley, Countess of Derby in 1907 using a golden key and in 1908 was renamed the Roger Kay Hall. The two schools shared the buildings, but they remained two very separate institutions, divided by a green baize door. The boys' school, for example, held morning prayers first each day.  As the boys trooped out through the door from the boys' half of the building, so the girls trooped in from theirs."]}]}}
