They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994.

Guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and bassist Colin Greenwood were in the same year, guitarist Ed O'Brien and drummer Philip Selway the year above, and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, brother of Colin, two years below. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became lead guitarist; he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician Nigel Powell and Yorke's brother Andy Yorke. According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to play together, rather than through any particular interest: \"It was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool.\" At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section.", "In Rainbows was downloaded an estimated 1.2\u00a0million times on the day of release, but Radiohead's management did not release sales figures, claiming that the distribution was intended to boost later retail sales. Colin Greenwood explained the internet release as a way of avoiding the \"regulated playlists\" and \"straitened formats\" of radio and TV, ensuring fans around the world could all experience the music at the same time, and preventing leaks in advance of a physical release.Greenwood, Colin (13 September 2010), \"Set Yourself Free \", Index on Censorship.

Since their shift from conventional rock music instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, the members have gained flexibility and now regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements. On Kid A and Amnesiac, Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played ondes Martenot, bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum machines and digital manipulation, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments into the new sound. The relaxed 2003 sessions for Hail to the Thief led to a different dynamic, with Yorke saying his power in the band had been \"absolutely unbalanced\" and that he would \"subvert everybody else's power at all costs.

Initially Yorke wanted to work lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: \"I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. It's a song for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts.\" Yorke compared the opening of the song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more \"stilted and leaden and mechanical\". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.", " \"OK Computer isn't the album we're going to rule the world with\", Colin Greenwood predicted at the time. \"It's not as hitting-everything-loudly-whilst-waggling-the-tongue-in-and-out, like The Bends.

The song premiered on the Radio 1 programme The Evening Session in April 1997 and was released as a single in May 1997.
