Later that month Geohaghon signed a one-month contract with Barnet following a successful trial period. He played four games in ten days, before leaving the club. In October 2011, he signed with Conference Premier club Darlington, leaving him working with manager Mark Cooper for a third time. He made his debut for the club in a 4\u20133 win over Stockport County, and four days later he set up Jonathan Sanchez-Munoz for the only goal of a 1\u20130 win at home to Kidderminster Harriers. Despite this, Cooper was sacked on 25 October. On 21 November, Geohaghon returned to League Two football, signing a three-month loan deal with Dagenham & Redbridge. He made his debut at Victoria Park on 12 December, setting up Brian Woodall for the opening goal of a 2\u20131 defeat to former club Port Vale. Meanwhile, his parent club Darlington were suffering financial difficulties and Geohaghon's contract was terminated on 16 January 2012, along with the rest of the playing squad and caretaker manager Craig Liddle. Darlington held onto his registration, and on 24 February he signed for Conference Premier rivals Mansfield Town on loan until the rest of the season. He scored his first goal in nearly eighteen months on 13 March, when he headed in a stoppage time equalizer in a 1\u20131 draw with Conference Premier leaders Fleetwood Town at Field Mill. The \"Stags\" reached the play-offs, but crashed out at the semi-final stage to York City 2\u20131 on aggregate, with Geohaghon scoring an own goal in the first leg at Bootham Crescent after a communication breakdown with goalkeeper Alan Marriott."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Brian Woodall"]}, {"page": "Brian Woodall", "response": ["Brian Woodall may refer to:", "* Brian Woodall (footballer, born 1948) (1948\u20132007), English football player for Sheffield Wednesday, Oldham Athletic, Chester and Crewe Alexandra", "* Brian Woodall (footballer, born 1987), English football player for Dagenham & Redbridge"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Brian Woodall"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Brian Woodall "]}, {"page": "Brian Woodall (footballer born 1987)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Woodall (footballer, born 1987)"]}]}}
