Oxford University Press, 2000  (p. 432).Lyn Smith, Voices against War : A Century of Protest. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing, 2009.  (pp. 63\u201364). For the first two years of its existence, it was known as the No More War International Movement. It became the British section of War Resisters International. Chaired by Fenner Brockway, it asked members to strive for revolutionary socialism but not to take part in any war. Other notable NMWM members included Wilfred Wellock,Michael Pugh, Liberal Internationalism: The Interwar Movement for Peace in Britain. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012.  (p. 94).

The movement also received messages of support from several international figures, including Albert Einstein.Otto Nathan, Heinz Norden, Einstein on Peace. Simon and Schuster, 1960. (p. 91). In 1926, a member proposed the creation of a white poppy, in the manner of the British Legion's red poppies, but with the added meaning of a hope for an end to all wars. The group did not pursue the idea, but it was later taken up by the Women's Co-operative Guild.Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations At its peak, the NMWM numbered around 3000 members, many from the Independent Labour Party. In 1929, several prominent British intellectuals signed a statement, \"Why I Believe in the No More War Movement\", supporting the NMWM's aims.W. J. Chamberlain, Fighting for Peace: The Story of the War Resistance Movement, London, 1929. Among the signatories were: Harold Laski, Frederick Soddy, H. M. Swanwick, Margaret Llewelyn Davies, Herbert Henry Elvin, John Scurr, Tom Williams, Evelyn Sharp, Emily Phipps, Canon Charles E. Raven, Rhys J. Davies, Hamilton Fyfe, the Marquis of Tavistock, Barbara Ayrton-Gould and Alfred Salter.

Evans, Florence Macfarlane, Monica Whately and Helen Archdale - as well as younger women like Winifred Holtby, Vera Brittain and Caroline Haslett. Though the membership was usually under 300, the Six Point Group wielded considerable political influence in the interwar years and during the Second World War. It campaigned by traditional constitutional methods. Much of its work was done through its journal, Time and Tide. It also made deputations to the appropriate government ministers, organised public rallies and wrote letters to major newspapers."]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1937\u20131949", "response": ["| Monica Whately"]}, {"page": "Mary Monica Whately", "response": ["#REDIRECT Monica Whately"]}, {"page": "Monica Whateley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Monica Whately"]}, {"page": "Dorothy Evans", "response": ["Evans had maintained simultaneous long-term relationships with Sybil Morrison and Emil Davies, a married Labour Party London County councillor.
