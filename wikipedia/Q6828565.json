The chairmen of the Commonwealth Games Federation and the British Olympic Association, and spokesmen from Downing Street and London 2012 denied any violation of the IOC's ethical code, insisting that Blair's comments were taken out of context as there was no intention to promote the bid. Nevertheless, to prevent future ethical clashes, barrister Michael Beloff was appointed the ethics commissioner for the London bid two months later."]}, {"page": "De Montfort University", "response": ["* Michael Beloff QC, barrister"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Aitken", "response": ["* A Short Walk On The Campus (1966, with Michael Beloff)"]}, {"page": "Stamford, Lincolnshire", "response": ["In 1333\u20131334, a group of students and tutors from Merton and Brasenose colleges, dissatisfied with conditions at the university, left Oxford to found a rival college at Stamford.

FINA submitted evidence from Jordi Segura, head of the IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, that said she took androstenedione, a metabolic precursor of testosterone, in the previous 10-to-12 hours before being tested.

During the debate, Syvret stated \"Senator Jeune has, in his capacity as President of the Policy and Resources Committee, used his influence to speed up the Law Drafting process and get this matter brought through. He has spoken on this matter in the House and at Committee meetings, even though he has a financial interest in this matter\".; ;  Reginald Jeune was a founding partner in one of Jersey's largest law firms Mourant, du Feu & Jeune.  That firm was engaged by two accounting firms from the UK to assist them in getting this controversial law on the Statute book. Reginald Jeune had stood down as a partner for the law firm several years previously. It was not disputed that he was engaged as a Consultant by the law firm, and continued to have an office and secretary in the firms headquarters. He claimed that he did not know that his law firm was acting for Price Waterhouse, that his position in the law firm was an honorary one, and that his office and secretarial support from that law firm were to assist him in his States work.;  These claims were never investigated. The Bailiff Sir Philip Bailhache, as presiding officer of the States assembly, subsequently wrote to Syvret, referring to the standing order which stated \"No Member shall impute improper motives to any other Member\", saying \"you have not provided me with any evidence to justify those imputations\", inviting Syvret to discuss the matter, and giving notice that matter would be put to the States assembly after the summer recess. At the States assembly on 3 September 1996, Syvret refused to withdraw his statement, and was not allowed to speak. Members voted by 36 to 3 (with 4 abstentions) in favour of the proposition \"That Mr. Syvret be suspended from the service of the States until he has withdrawn, by notice in writing to the Greffier, his imputations of improper motives against Senator Jeune\". In an interview shortly afterwards, Syvret told The Observer, \"I was not allowed to defend myself. This is like something out of George Orwell's 1984.... I was not allowed to defend myself, to speak on my behalf\". UK MP Austin Mitchell described the States of Jersey's conduct in the matter as that of a \"legislature for hire\" and he sponsored an Early Day Motion in the UK Parliament critical of Syvret's suspension. The States of Jersey subsequently agreed to set up a committee of inquiry into procedural matters relating to the drafting of the legislation. On 4 March 1997, Svyret returned to address the States assembly and stated that he alleged only that Senator Jeune had breached Standing Orders 43 and 44 of the States of Jersey. As Syvret had not alleged improper motives against Senator Jeune he therefore could not withdraw an allegation which he had not made; Syvret left the States meeting and the States then resolved to censure him but to lift his suspension. In April 1998, Michael Beloff QC, sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court, struck out legal proceedings brought by Syvret challenging the legality of his suspension from the States assembly on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction over the legislature's internal procedures.", "On 14 October 2010, Syvret was convicted by the Magistrate's Court of the motoring offences, when the Assistant Magistrate criticized the police as overreacting in the way they arrested Syvret. On 17 November 2010, the court found Syvret guilty of the data protection offences and guilty of contempt of court on account of his non-attendance and words of disrespect. The prosecuting Attorney General made two charges against Syvret for the aforementioned blogging of the Faudemer Report. The charges came under the Data Protection (Jersey) Law, Articles 55, 17, and 21. The opinion on these two charges by Assistant Magistrate Mrs B.
