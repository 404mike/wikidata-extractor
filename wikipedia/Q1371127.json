She was appointed in 1936 following a \"search for the Girl with the Golden Voice\". Her voice was used from 1936 until 1963, when it was replaced by Pat Simmons. She also made a record for the GPO helping other staff improve their speaking voice and went on to become announcer for Henry Hall during one of his broadcast concerts. She was later offered a film part by Columbia Pictures under the name of Jane Cain.Originally the speaking clock was accessed by dialing 846, spelling out the letters T-I-M, on the telephone dial in 'Director Area' (London, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool & Manchester) and 952 as it was introduced elsewhere in the UK. Later the code on non-director exchanges became 80 and then 8081 before finally becoming standardised everywhere as 123, away from the numbering ranges used by subscribers.\nIn the mid to late 1950s, she was a member of Perth Repertory Theatre Company.\nHer only known big screen role was the lead in the 1935 film, Vanity. She is also credited with small roles in the TV series Starr and Company (1958) and Thirty-Minute Theatre (1961).Her voice lives on as the voice of the virtual operator on C*NET, a worldwide network of old telephone exchanges preserved by collectors which uses a voice recognition system when '0' or '100' are dialled for the 'operator'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Kinnear", "response": ["In the 1950s, Kinnear began a career in repertory theatre when he appeared in a show at Newquay.

Prior to joining Littlewood's company, he was a member of the cast of Perth Repertory Theatre.

The mechanism used was an array of motors, glass discs, photocells and valves which took up the floorspace of a small room. The voice was that of London telephonist Ethel Jane Cain, who had won a prize of 10 guineas () in a competition to find the \"Golden Voice\". Cain's voice was recorded optically onto the glass disks in a similar way to a film soundtrack. The service was obtained by dialling the letters TIM (846) on a dial telephone, and hence the service was often colloquially referred to as \"Tim\". However this code was only used in the telephone systems of the cities of London, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. Other areas initially dialled 952, but with the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling it was changed to 808 and later 8081 as more 'recorded services' were introduced. It was standardised to 123 by the early 1990s.", "# Ethel Jane Cain, first permanent voice: from July 24, 1936 to 1963."]}, {"page": "Time lady", "response": ["***Jane Cain"]}, {"page": "Pat Simmons (voice actress)", "response": ["A supervisor at a London telephone exchange, in 1963 Simmons won a \u00a3500 competition to replace Jane Cain, whose voice had been used since the service began in 1936.
