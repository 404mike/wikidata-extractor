Fintan O'Toole similarly praised the Convention's work, and suggested the government's tepid response would increase public cynicism with politics."]}, {"page": "Political funding in Ireland", "response": ["Details about the sources of political funds prior to 2012 were rather scarce. Based on the information published for 1998 Murphy and Farrell contend that Fianna F\u00e1il and Sinn F\u00e9in were the parties which received the highest amounts of private funding. Fianna F\u00e1il reported \u20ac432,501 and Sinn F\u00e9in total donations of \u20ac230,000. Whereas the bulk of the former funds were contributed by the business sector (e.g. hoteliers, builders etc.), most of the latter came from U.S. donors(friends of Sinn F\u00e9in). The Labour Party was heavily reliant on contributions by the trade unions.Murphy, Ronan J. and Farrell, David M.: 'Party Politics in Ireland: Regularizing a Volatile System', in: Paul Webb, David Farrell and Ian Holliday (eds.): Political Parties in Advanced Industrial Democracies, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 230-31.", "* Murphy, Ronan J. and Farrell, David M.: 'Party Politics in Ireland: Regularizing a Volatile System', in: Paul Webb, David Farrell and Ian Holliday (eds.): Political Parties in Advanced Industrial Democracies, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002, pp.\u00a0217\u201347."]}, {"page": "David M.
