George Guest was born in 1771 at Bury St. Edmunds. He was chorister of the Chapels Royal, and may have been the \"Master Guest\" who was one of the principal singers (in Messiah and miscellaneous concerts) for the Hereford musical festival of 1783. Guest was organist at Eye, Suffolk, in 1787, and at St. Peter's, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, from 1789 to 1831. He died at Wisbech on 11 September 1831, after a long and severe illness, aged 60.\nHe was the composer of four fugues and sixteen voluntaries for the organ; the cantatas, the 'Afflicted African' and the 'Dying Christian;' three quartets for flute and strings; three duets for two violoncellos; pieces for military bands; hymns, glees, and songs. It is probable that John Guest (fl. 1795), music master of Bury, and Jane Mary Guest (fl. 1780), afterwards Mrs. Miles, pianist, composer, and instructor of the Princess Charlotte of Wales, were relatives.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April Cantelo", "response": ["As well as three Haydn Masses with St. John\u2019s College, Cambridge forces and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under George Guest (on Argo), nineteenth century works included Schubert part songs (Argo), Donizetti's Emilia di Liverpool (Candida and Bettina) with Sutherland (BBC/Myto), Berlioz B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict (H\u00e9ro) and m\u00e9lodies (Philips), Sullivan's Iolanthe (Celia) under Sargent (HMV), and Solveig songs in Grieg's Peer Gynt with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Alexander Gibson (World Record Club)."]}, {"page": "George Guest (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Guest (1924\u20132002), was a Welsh organist and choral conductor.", "George Guest may also refer to:", "*George Guest (English organist) (1771\u20131831), English organist and composer"]}]}}
