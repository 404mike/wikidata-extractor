He was here at the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, detected the first signs of disaffection, and reported them. After the capture of Delhi he was one of the special commissioners appointed to hunt up the rebels, and in this capacity was principally engaged in examining the papers of the Nana of Cawnpore. He arrived at Lucknow in time to see the city evacuated by the rebels, and after this event acted as secretary successively to Sir James Outram, Sir Robert Montgomery, and Charles John Wingfield, until, in 1860, he was appointed commissioner to the Punjab.

The situation in Awadh was much analysed in the aftermath of the insurgency, and the group of followers of James Thomason there in 1856, Colville Calverley Jackson and Charles John Wingfield as well as Gubbins, came under scrutiny. Gubbins had tried to deal more sympathetically with the taluqdars, whose discontent with change had caused a revolt. Although Henry Lawrence had had some sympathy for the approach taken by Gubbins to land reform, and also found Jackson unacceptable, Gubbins was tarred with a long history of quarrels, and the fact that Lawrence had found him troublesome. His Mutinies in Oudh was found self-serving, and was rebutted, by George Hutchinson (1826\u20131899) of the Bengal Engineers, in Narrative of the Mutinies in Oude. Hutchinson was commissioned by Robert Montgomery, brought in to be Chief Commissioner of Oudh, over Gubbins's head."]}]}}
