She was noted for her skills in observational comedy and in satirising aspects of social class.Wood started her career in 1974 by appearing on, and winning, the ATV talent show New Faces. She established herself as a comedy star in the 1980s, winning a BAFTA TV Award in 1986 for the sketch series Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV (1985\u201387), and became one of Britain's most popular stand-up comics, winning a second BAFTA for An Audience with Victoria Wood (1988).
