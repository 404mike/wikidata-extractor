Unbeknownst to Felix, however, the exchange of power was instead given to his son, granting him the autonomous arcane powers he sought. Trained by his father in the mystic arts, Felix's abusive ways and manipulations caused Sebastian to reject his evil lineage and prove himself a capable superhero. He has since garnered connections to the superhero community despite being at odds with them due to being Felix's son, having been involved in superhero teams such as the Outsiders and the Sentinels of Magic.
