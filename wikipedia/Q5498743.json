He was born at Kensington, London and died at Parkstone, Dorset. In some sources, his name is written as \"Leeston-Smith\". According to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1905 (which states that he died in 1903), he adopted the \"Leeston\" name in 1880.Educated at Malvern College and Christ's College, Brecon, Smith was a right-handed opening or middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler, though he did not bowl in first-class cricket. He played club cricket for Weston-super-Mare Cricket Club and in a match against Thornbury he hit E. M. Grace, W. G.'s elder brother, for four sixes off consecutive balls. He played in several matches for Somerset before the county club was given first-class status in 1882, but thereafter appeared in just three matches, scoring useful runs in each of them, with a highest score of 37 in his final game, against Gloucestershire in August 1885.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Smith", "response": ["Fred, Frederic, or Frederick Smith may refer to:", "*Frederick Smith, 3rd Earl of Birkenhead (1936\u20131985), British peer and author", "*Frederick Smith, 2nd Viscount Hambleden (1868\u20131928), British MP", "*Frederick Smith (Australian politician) (1883\u20131960), Australian politician, government minister in Western Australia", "*Frederick Smith (barrister) (1924\u20132016), Attorney General of Barbados and Chief Justice of Turks and Caicos", "*Frederick Smith (lawyer) (1773\u20131830), Pennsylvania lawyer, state Attorney General, state Supreme Court Justice", "*Sir Frederick Smith (Conservative MP) (1790\u20131874), British general and colonel-commandant of the Royal Engineers, and Conservative MP for Chatham", "*Frederick Smith (footballer), English football player at outside right with Stockport County, Darlington, Exeter City and Gillingham in the 1930s", "*Frederick Smith (Somerset cricketer) (1854\u20131894), English cricketer", "*Frederick Smith (Barbadian cricketer) (1837-1923), Barbadian cricketer", "*Frederick Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead (1907\u20131975), British historian", "*Frederick Smith (entomologist) (1805\u20131879), British entomologist", "*Frederick Smith, 1st Baron Colwyn (1859\u20131946), British businessman", "*Frederick Smith, 2nd Baron Colwyn (1914\u20131966), stockbroker and British Army officer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Frederick Smith (1884\u20131885) 3 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Sainsbury batting scores dipped in county cricket during 1879; in nine appearances for Somerset during the year, his highest score was 39. He performed better with the ball, twice taking four wickets during an innings, against both Bedfordshire and the MCC. The following county season began more positively for Sainsbury, as he collected nine wickets in the match against Sussex at Lansdown's ground in Bath, claiming six wickets for 54\u00a0runs in the second innings of the game. He claimed another eight wickets when Somerset travelled to Leicestershire, during which Sainsbury and Arnold Fothergill took five wickets each in Leicestershire's first innings, restricting the home side to 51\u00a0runs. Somerset won the low-scoring contest by 85\u00a0runs, Sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side's first innings. Somerset's visit to Sussex saw Sainsbury continue his success against the county, this time with the bat rather than the ball. Sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183, leaving Somerset the task of scoring 247 runs to win the match. Sainsbury scored his second century for Somerset, remaining 101 not out when Somerset reached the winning total. He was assisted by a half-century from Stephen Newton, and scores in the twenties by Bill Fowler and Frederick Smith. Later that month, his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a Somerset victory, when he top-scored with 87 as Somerset beat the MCC by an innings."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Frederick Smith ", "Somerset were the hosts once more for their final match of the season, played with just a single day off after the Surrey match, and that only because the scheduled three-day match was concluded in two days.
