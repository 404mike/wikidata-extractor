Our Rabbi Chaim the Levite's Novellae on Maimonides) is a volume of insights written by Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik on Maimonides\u2019 Mishneh Torah, it also contains numerous novel understandings of the Talmud. Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik is known as the founder of the Brisker Derech (also known as Lomdus, the conceptual approach to Talmudic study), and was famous for the brilliant manner with which he reconciled contradictions in Maimonides' writings. The text was written in a very terse style whose intricacy is difficult to decipher even for those very familiar with the Brisker Derech, and was written for those already on a very advanced level of Talmudic and Halachic study.\u201cRabbenu Chaim HaLevi's sefer of chiddushim on the Rambam was indeed a sefer that opened gates of light, one \"whose expression was enlightening and waters pure,\" in the Grach's sons' words, but it is a difficult sefer. It words are not understandable from only a light reading, even to those who are used to the Brisker way of thinking. The Grach's son, Rav Moshe zt'l, once said that the sefer is difficult because his father wrote it for men on his level, and he cited the Or Somayach zt'l as an example. It is for such men, he said, that the sefer was written.\u201d In-Depth Features: A Divine Prince in our Midst by Mordechai Plaut  Rabbi Chaim\u2019s son Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik first printed it posthumously in 1936, he stated in the preface that his father wrote it with extreme precision, having \u201csifted the text seven times over and winnowed it a hundred times more.\u201dMentor of Generations: Reflections on Rabbi Joseph B.

A person died, followed shortly thereafter by another, wealthier person. The Chevra Kadisha (Jewish burial society), rather than follow the first-come, first-served policy mandated by halacha, buried the rich person first. A relative of the poorer person came to demand an apology from the Chevra Kadisha. Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik consulted the Laws of Mourning from Rambam' Mishneh Torah for just a moment before telling the relative: \"The Chevra Kadisha were wrong, but that is between them and God. I will inform them that their conduct was improper, but you are not involved here.\"  After the fellow left, Rabbi Soloveitchik explained to his colleague, Rabbi Abramsky, that the question at hand was this: certainly Judaism has a general principle of first-come, first-served, because of the rule that when faced with the opportunity to do a mitzvah, one should not pass it up. If this is the only reason that first-come, first-served applies in the case of burials, then one who violates it is no more in the wrong than one who has passed over any mitzva opportunity, and his/her offense is between himself/herself and God. Or, instead, there may be a specialized notion of first-come, first-served when it comes to burials, to avoid offending the bereaved. Only according to the latter reasoning would an apology be required. Rabbi Soloveitchik found that Maimonides made no explicit mention of first-come, first-served in his Laws of Mourning, and thus extrapolated that only the generalized notion of first-come, first-served applies to burial. Therefore, the bereaved could not demand an apology. Upon hearing this reasoning, Rabbi Abramsky exclaimed (in a positive way), \"Rabbi Soloveitchik can deduce laws from the fact that Maimonides says nothing at all!\""]}, {"page": "London Beth Din", "response": ["The Beth Din has functioned as the central religious authority in Britain since the early eighteenth century.
