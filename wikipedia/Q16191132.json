With William Henry Ashurst, he was a major backer of the Anti-Persecution Union set up in 1842 by George Holyoake and Emma Martin, and also of the Theological Utilitarians. He supported The Plebeian, founded in 1844 by Matilda Roalfe and William Baker. He supported also \"The Library of Reason\", the penny pamphlet series sponsored by Henry Hetherington. When in 1845 Holyoake was seriously ill, and under financial strain with the Movement, his publication, Birch with others found him in London after he returned from a period in Leicester with Josiah Gimson, and saw him back to health. Birch contributed to the Movement, as did Sophia Dobson Collet, and others grouped as \"middle-class freethinkers\" (George Gwynne, Arthur Trevelyan)."]}, {"page": "Roalfe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Matilda Roalfe"]}]}}
