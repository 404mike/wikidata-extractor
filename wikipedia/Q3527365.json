Coldwell was a right-arm fast-medium bowler who was, for a few years in the early to mid-1960s, half of a respected and feared new-ball partnership in English county cricket. With his bowling partner Jack Flavell, Coldwell was the attacking force behind the unprecedented success of Worcestershire which brought the county its first successes in the County Championship in 1964 and 1965.\nIn 1961, Coldwell took 140 wickets and finished sixth in the national averages; the following year, his best, he took 152 wickets and was fourth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Trueman was selected for the first three Tests against Australia in 1964, was omitted from the fourth and then recalled for the fifth in which he became the first bowler to capture 300 Test wickets. England again failed to recover the Ashes in a generally disappointing 1964 series which is only memorable for Trueman's unprecedented feat. On 15 August 1964, he reached the milestone when he had Neil Hawke caught by Colin Cowdrey at slip in the fifth Test at the Oval. Hawke, a good friend of Trueman off the field, was the first to congratulate him. The occasion produced one of Trueman's few concessions to fatigue when he was asked if he thought his record would ever be broken and he quipped: \"Aye, but whoever does it will be bloody tired\". As Warr pointed out: \"This comment reveals the essence of the man. A touch of belligerence, a hint of humility, a pinch of roughness and an over-riding sense of humour\". Meanwhile, Yorkshire lost the County Championship title which was won for the first time by a very strong Worcestershire team which starred Tom Graveney and featured Basil D'Oliveira, Norman Gifford and fast bowlers Len Coldwell and Jack Flavell. Trueman's overall achievements in 1964 did not meet his own high standards and his tally of exactly 100 wickets was well down on his totals in recent seasons."]}, {"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Their first period of great success came in the 1960s under the Presidency of Sir George Dowty and the captaincy of Don Kenyon, when the county won two County Championships thanks to the achievements of such players as Norman Gifford, Tom Graveney, Jack Flavell, Len Coldwell and Basil D'Oliveira. They were also losing finalist in the first ever Gillette Cup Final in 1963 - the inaugural limited overs knockout competition in England. In 1971 Worcestershire won their first ever Sunday League title thanks largely to the bowling of Vanburn Holder and the New Zealander Glenn Turner was instrumental in Worcestershire's third championship win in 1974.

David Allen was dropped to make way for the extra batsman and Ray Illingworth in favour of Fred Titmus, but this was quite normal as these three off-spinners regularly displaced each other depending on current form and favour. Wicket-keeper John Murray was replaced by debutant Alan Smith due to his superior batting on tour, even though he too had been hit on the head by a Wes Hall bouncer the week before. Fast bowlers Len Coldwell and David Larter had been tried out in the Fifth Test against Pakistan at the Oval, but the old firm of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham were back in action, even though Trueman had a broken bone in his back and had been told by an Australian doctor that he would never bowl again.p282, Trueman", "Australia kept an unchanged XI for the Second Test, but England made two changes; Peter Parfitt was replaced by the veteran Tom Graveney who had made 122 not out against South Australia and Barry Knight by Len Coldwell who had taken 6/49 in the MCC's 5-wicket win over Victoria. Parfitt had been in poor form all tour except for the slow 80 he made in the First Test, though being used as a makeshift opener had not helped. Graveney was an old hand who had toured in 1954\u201355 and 1958\u201359, while Coldwell was proving to be a better bowler than Knight, whose only advantage was that he was an all-rounder, but in a team that still had eight recognised batsman this was not too much of a loss. Alan Smith was still preferred as wicket-keeper to John Murray, though not so much as to be \"the mystery of the tour\"p81, Moyes and Goodman as though Murray was the better keeper the difference in ability was minor. Brian Statham (231), Richie Benaud (226) and Fred Trueman (219) were all approaching Alec Bedser's record of 236 Test wickets.

Norm O'Neill came in until lunch when Australia went in on 93/1 off 22 overs in two hours, a total somewhat less than 15 overs an hour promised by Ted Dexter at the start of the tour. After lunch Lawry edged a ball from Statham between the wicket-keeper Alan Smith and Tom Graveney at first slip, the ball cutting back after it hit the turf.

Colin Cowdrey came in at 19/2, but with bags of confidence after hitting 307 (with 4 sixes and 29 fours) against South Australia, his highest first-class score and the best by a tourist in Australia. Together Dexter and Cowdrey withstood Davidson's burst of speed, the other bowlers failed to trouble them and by stealing quick ones, twos and threes they rebuilt the innings. Occasionally Dexter would strike out and at the end of a long, hot day he gave Bobby Simpson a catch of Benaud (1/82) and was out for 93, his third missed century in three innings. The stand had made 175 runs and the unluckiest bowler was Norm O'Neill (0/19) who had Cowdrey dropped on 56 and dropped a hard-hit return from Dexter on 89.

Hall (0/106) was overbowled on the now flat Woolloongabba wicket and Queensland's best bowler was the leg-spinner Colin Westaway (3/156), which pretty much sums up the innings as the MCC piled up 581/6.

Colin Cowdrey was still in charge and after winning the toss he put Victoria in to bat in the hope that there would be some early life in the Melbourne wicket. Victorian was a weak team in this period and their innings relied heavily on a long, tedious 177 by the 25-year-old captain Bill Lawry who added 85 with Jack potter (44) and 158 with Neville West (70).

Batting again Dexter made 71 not out and Tom Graveney 41 before the MCC innings was declared at 190/4, leaving the home team 301 to win. After Max Fox (31) and Boxsell (40) added 68 for the first wicket they collapsed to 128/9 as Allen (5/38), Graveney (2/21) and Pullar (3/26) span them out. The crowd were determined to invade the ground on the point of victory, as they had seen in the Sydney Test, but last man Gilmour held everybody up by throwing his bat around for 29 in a last wicket stand of 33. When he was finally caught by Dexter off Geoff Pullar the enthusiastic crowd climbed the fences. Fred Trueman was bowled over and had his cap taken, but he soon recovered it and the teams ran off the field.pp. 114-116 Moyes and Goodman", "In 1958-59 the MCC had insisted on fewer upcountry matches, on this tour they were increased and as a result New South Wales lost its return match with the tourists, though Sydney did get two Tests. The Victoria Park Oval was a lovely ground, surrounded by bowling greens, croquet lawns, cricket and football fields, public parks and a zoo. The Country XI were overawed by Fred Trueman (4/45) in the first innings, with Len Coldwell taking 3/25 and David Allen 3/34 helping him dismiss them for 138. John Murray was wicket-keeping again after his injury in the Third Test and showed no ill effects. The MCC made 451/8 in return with David Sheppard (93) and captain Colin Cowdrey (97) added 151 before both getting out within minutes of stumps in the 98 degree heat. Graveney making the fastest century of the tour, 106 in 81 minutes and hit four sixes and Barry Knight hit a powerful 70. The Country XI survived the day to earn a draw even though Allen took 3/51, they made 227/5 thanks to the 24-year-old chemist Ian Drake. Drake was 'run out' on 59 when he hit the ball to the fence and Umpire Clare signalled a boundary, but Ray Illingworth picked it up a foot inside and threw it to Murray, who broke the wicket and Umpire Miller gave him out. Cowdrey called him back to continue the innings and he made 101, the first century by a Country player against the MCC since the war.pp139-141, Moyes and Goodman"]}, {"page": "Mike Westcott", "response": ["Westcott made his debut for Durham against the Yorkshire Second XI in the 1965 Minor Counties Championship.
