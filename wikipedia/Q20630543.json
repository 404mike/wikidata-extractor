Clark was partly inspired by a Renaissance painting \u2014 also double-sided \u2014 by Barthel Bruyn the Elder.\" Since 1994, Clark's Five Wounds have been on permanent display at Chichester Cathedral, alongside works by Graham Sutherland, John Piper and Marc Chagall.\"In some the glaze is so heavy that their raised and gleaming beads of crimson appear to flow. In others pieces of yellow 'bone' seem to rise beneath the skin. Any initial revulsion soon gives way to enchantment. [...] In the Wounds the viewer comes face to face with the very real nature of Christ's suffering and consequently with our own mortality. 'These works are forms to meditate upon' explains the artist. 'A trigger-release mechanism; a way of opening up.'\"Maria Balshaw, director of the Tate, listed Clark's portrait of filmmaker Derek Jarman, The Gardener (1994), as one of her favourite works in the collection of the Whitworth Art Gallery.  \u201cMichael Clark drew the film-maker towards the end of his life, when he was a man facing sickness and death. The drawing has a distinct and immediate impact, foregrounding as it does the quality of personal courage of the sitter. You are powerfully drawn to the face, you have a sense that the sitter trusted the artist to see into the eyes, to do much more than observe \u2026\u201d After purchasing Seer (1993), a grisaille portrait of Derek Jarman, in 1995, the National Portrait Gallery commissioned Clark, in 1999, to make a portrait of the filmmaker Nicolas Roeg. Clark delivered Al-Jebr, a kinetic assemblage made of mixed media portraying Roeg, which in Arabic means 'the bringing together of broken parts'."]}, {"page": "Esme Ward", "response": ["Esme Ward was appointed as Director of Manchester Museum in April 2018.
