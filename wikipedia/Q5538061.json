The pre-season consisted of selling top striker Tom Nolan to Bradford Park Avenue and manager Holford talking of a 'young players policy'. The season finished in a second-from-bottom finish and another plea for donations to survive financially. Warney Cresswell was appointed as manager for the club's 1936\u201337 campaign, with the aim of promotion. Tom Nolan was also brought back from Bradford. After a mid-table finish Creswell left the club. A young Eric Hayward was transferred to Blackpool, Ken Gunn moved onto Northampton Town and Allan Todd went to Nottingham Forest. Roger Jones also ended his fourteen-year association with the club. In December 1937 Tom Morgan was reinstated as manager. He was unable to prevent the 1937\u201338 season being another story of mid-table mediocrity. Jack Roberts impressive tally of 28 goals was the only ray of hope for escaping the division. At the end of the season roughly half the team were transferred or let go. Notable new faces for the 1938\u201339 campaign were goalkeeper Arthur Jepson, defender George Collin and right-half George Hannah. The club was also transferred to the Third Division South, good news as the league saw higher gate receipts. The club failed to have any impact on the division though, and were fighting to avoid a re-election battle rather than achieve promotion, as injuries hit the squad."]}, {"page": "1938\u201339 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw another reconstruction of the first eleven, as eleven new signings arrived at The Old Recreation Ground, most notably: highly rated goalkeeper Arthur Jepson (Grantham Town); veteran left-back George Collin (Sunderland); right-half George Hannah (Derby County); left-half Sid Wileman (signed from Derby for 'a substantial fee'); and goalscoring winger John Callender (Lincoln City). Work at the stadium took place, as ground outside the stadium was prepared for car parking. The eclectic training schedule of the previous season was expanded, with bowls and cricket supplemented by games of tennis and baseball. Also on 20 August, a Football League Jubilee Fund match was played against nearby Crewe Alexandra, with the Vale picking up a 3\u20132 win, raising \u00a3243 in the process.", "On the financial side, gate receipts had increased by \u00a3659, however an overall loss was made of \u00a31,723. The move to the southern division had cost a considerable amount in transfer fees, though home game income had improved by \u00a3676 to \u00a36,403. Further financial worries were lessened by a transfer credit of \u00a31,455. Despite the poor season, seventeen players were kept on, though promising teenage midfielder John Smith was sold to Chelsea.
