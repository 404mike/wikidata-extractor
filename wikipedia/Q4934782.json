Two defeats to eventual champions Tottenham Hotspur followed, before the club scored their first goal, and picked up their first win against South Shields on 10 November thanks to an Aaron Lockett strike. The club signed Bobby Blood from Leek United for \u00a350 in order to bolster their strike force, the player had one leg shorter than the other and was riddled with bullets from his valiant efforts in the First World War, and yet he would still prove the doctors wrong who said he would never play football again. The win against South Shields initiated a run of three wins in five games. However this was followed by a streak of seven games without victory. Vale had settled in the league by January, and went into the derby with Stoke in March having lost just one of their previous eight games. This included a 4\u20130 win over Rotherham County which saw Blood score all four, and a 4\u20131 win over Nottingham Forest in which Blood claimed a hat-trick.

The following week they achieved the double over Stoke by recording a 1\u20130 victory at the Victoria Ground.

Injuries to Price and Brough then saw the team slump, and this continued when new signing, Manchester City goalkeeper Walter Smith was arrested for assault on the day of his debut. The arrest is likely to account for a majority of the six goals he conceded that day at South Shields.

Vale lost both their games to Bristol City, though Blood demonstrated his fearsome shooting power by blasting a penalty kick at City's keeper \u2013 the keeper saved the penalty to keep a clean sheet but broke his wrist in the process of saving the shot.
