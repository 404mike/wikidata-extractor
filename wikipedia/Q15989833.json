He was also an amateur cricketer who played in 16 first-class cricket matches.\nBayley was the  second son of Sir John Edward George Bayley, 2nd Baronet (1793\u20131871), and brother of Sir John Robert Laurie Emilius Bayley, 3rd Baronet. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. Bayley captained the 1844 cricket team at Eton and played first-class cricket from 1846 to 1848. He played eight matches for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), of whom his father was president in 1844, and four times for Kent County Cricket Club and the Gentlemen of Kent.Bayley was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in May 1850, and married, in May 1852, Isabella, daughter of Anthony Mactier, of Durris House, Kincardineshire, who died in April 1860. He emigrated to Australia, arriving in late 1858, and was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 19 Jan 1859 and Attorney-General Wales in the second Charles Cowper Government from 21 February 1859.  His appointment gave great offence to the legal fraternity, as he had been but a short time in the colony; and Daniel Deniehy moved a resolution censuring his nomination. It was not, however, carried. Bayley resigned from the Legislative Council on 28 April 1859 to stand for the newly created electoral district of Mudgee in the Legislative Assembly, winning with 69% of the votes. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly on 26 November 1859, and moved to Melbourne before returning to England.In 1866 Bayley was appointed Advocate-General at Bombay, India, and Puisne Judge in 1869. When Charles Farran, junior to him, was posted Chief Justice, he resigned in 1895. Bayley briefly acted as aide-de-camp to the Viceroy of India.Bayley died on 4 August 1910 at Parkstone, Dorset, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Daniel Deniehy", "response": ["Members of Parliament were not paid at this time, and Deniehy always earned his living as a barrister and as a journalist. He founded and edited Southern Cross, a radical newspaper, in 1859. Deniehy had opposed the appointment of Lyttleton Bayley as Attorney General and produced a satire How I Became Attorney-General of New Barataria (Sydney, 1860) which was published in the Southern Cross. In Melbourne in 1862 he edited The Victorian for its owner, the Irish-Australian politician Charles Gavan Duffy. In Sydney he became a notable literary critic, and lectured on modern literature at the newly founded Sydney University. He was a regular contributor to the Irish-Australian newspaper The Freeman's Journal and other papers."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Mudgee", "response": ["| Lyttleton Bayley"]}, {"page": "Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, 1859\u20131860", "response": ["| Bayley, LyttletonLyttleton Bayley"]}, {"page": "List of New South Wales state by-elections", "response": ["||Mudgee || Lyttleton Bayley|| Resigned after losing ministerial post ||19 December 1859 || Samuel Terry"]}, {"page": "Lyttleton Holyoake Bayley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lyttleton Bayley"]}, {"page": "Lyttelton Bayley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lyttleton Bayley"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Played in 29 first-class matches, mainly for MCC and Kent sides.
