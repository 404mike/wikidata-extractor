Trent Reznor would hear this material and offer them a deal with Nothing Records.  However, 12 Rounds was courted by numerous other labels as well.  Claudia stated, \"We were shocked by the influx of offers, but Nothing was so right for us because it's so artist-led.  It's really the difference between feeling like a handmade Bristol and being on a Ford conveyor belt.\" Their sophomore album, My Big Hero, featured eight new tracks, alongside two songs from Jitter Juice; \"Something's Burning\" and \"Pleasant Smell\" (though both would have minor differences from their original versions).  Pleasant Smell was released as a single on Nothing ahead of the album on June 9, 1998, featuring remixes from Trent Reznor, Charlie Clouser and Keith Hillebrandt of Nine Inch Nails, as well as Nothing Records label-mate Clint Mansell.  A music video was also released for \"Pleasant Smell.\"  The single was followed by the release of My Big Hero on July 14, 1998.  The band then went on their first tours of the United States, with Kirk Hellie joining the band to take over guitar duties.  They took opening slots for VAST and Nothing Records label-mates Marilyn Manson, as part of the first leg of their Mechanical Animals tour.", "In 2004, Atticus joined his brother Leopold Ross in forming the noise rock band Error, though it would be short-lived, with a one-off E.P. being released on Epitaph Records.  Atticus also made contributions to another of Leopold's rock bands, Nojahoda, although that project would also be short-lived.  Atticus began to deepen his musical collaboration with Trent Reznor, beginning with the Nine Inch Nails album With Teeth in 2005.  Meanwhile, Claudia Sarne would collaborate with Nothing label-mate Clint Mansell, to provide vocals to the main theme to the film The Hole in 2001.  She later joined former Nine Inch Nails member Jerome Dillon's band nearLY in 2006.  After the completion nearLY's debut album Reminder, the band played a handful of select live performances.  These performances were recorded as a live CD/DVD, entitled Reminder Live, which was self-released by the band.  It included a performance of \"Chicane,\" one of the songs from 12 Rounds' unreleased third album.  After the release of Reminder Live, Claudia announced her departure from nearLY, with the band as a whole quietly dissolving shortly after.", "That same year, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed their first collaborative film score together, for the David Fincher film The Social Network, for which the pair won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.

Atticus likewise garnered acclaim as a solo film composer, composing scores to Love & Mercy, Blackhat, Triple 9, the TV series Outcast and more, all of which featured contributions from Claudia Sarne as well.

Trent Reznor was credited with additional recording for the track \"Shine On.\"  In 2014, the members of 12 Rounds reunited for a performance at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, California, as part of a Q&A event with Atticus Ross and Elvis Mitchell for the Los Angeles Film Festival.  It marked the first ever live performance by the current line-up of the band, featuring Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne, Leopold Ross and Kirk Hellie, as well as the first performance of any kind by the band in over a decade.
