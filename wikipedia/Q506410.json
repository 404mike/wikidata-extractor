Although he noted that Keats could be \"wayward, trembling, easily daunted,\" Woodhouse was convinced of Keats's genius, a poet to support as he became one of England's greatest writers. Soon after they met, the two became close friends, and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana, documenting as much as he could about the poetry. This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats's work. Andrew Motion represents him as Boswell to Keats's Johnson, ceaselessly promoting his work, fighting his corner and spurring his poetry to greater heights. In later years, Woodhouse was one of the few to accompany Keats to Gravesend to embark on his final trip to Rome.Motion (1997), p. 157.", "Shelley promoted Keats as someone whose achievement could not be separated from agony, who was 'spiritualised' by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today.Motion (1997), p. 499.

Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin, Robert Gittings, Walter Jackson Bate, Aileen Ward, and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness.

It was during the thirty years he worked with distinction as university librarian at the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull that he produced the greater part of his published work. His poems are marked by what Andrew Motion calls \"a very English, glum accuracy\u201d about emotions, places, and relationships, and what Donald Davie described as \"lowered sights and diminished expectations\". Eric Homberger (echoing Randall Jarrell) called him \"the saddest heart in the post-war supermarket\"\u2014Larkin himself said that deprivation for him was \u201cwhat daffodils were for Wordsworth\u201d.Motion 2005, pp. 208\u2013209; Chatterjee 2006, p. 19 (for Donald Davie). Influenced by W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats, and Thomas Hardy, his poems are highly structured but flexible verse forms. They were described by Jean Hartley, the ex-wife of Larkin's publisher George Hartley (the Marvell Press), as a \"piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent\", though anthologist Keith Tuma writes that there is more to Larkin's work than its reputation for dour pessimism suggests.Tuma 2001, p. 445.", "Philip Larkin was born on 9 August 1922 at 2, Poultney Road, Radford, Coventry,  the only son and younger child of Sydney Larkin (1884\u20131948) and his wife Eva Emily (1886\u20131977), daughter of first-class excise officer William James Day. Sydney Larkin's family originated in Kent, but had lived since at least the eighteenth century at Lichfield, Staffordshire, where they were in trade first as tailors, then also as coach-builders and shoe-makers. The Day family were of Epping, Essex, but moved to Leigh in Lancashire in 1914 where William Day took a post administering pensions and other dependent allowances.

Poet Andrew Motion observes of Larkin's poems: \"their rage or contempt is always checked by the ... energy of their language and the satisfactions of their articulate formal control\". Motion contrasts two aspects of his poetic personality\u2014on the one hand, an enthusiasm for \"symbolist moments\" and \"freely imaginative narratives\", and on the other a \"remorseless factuality\" and \"crudity of language\". Motion defines this as a \"life-enhancing struggle between opposites\", and concludes that his poetry is typically \"ambivalent\": \"His three mature collections have developed attitudes and styles of ... imaginative daring: in their prolonged debates with despair, they testify to wide sympathies, contain passages of frequently transcendent beauty, and demonstrate a poetic inclusiveness which is of immense consequence for his literary heirs.\"", "In Larkin at Sixty, amongst the portraits by friends and colleagues such as Kingsley Amis, Noel Hughes and Charles Monteith and dedicatory poems by John Betjeman, Peter Porter and Gavin Ewart, the various strands of Larkin's output were analysed by critics and fellow poets: Andrew Motion, Christopher Ricks and Seamus Heaney looked at the poems, Alan Brownjohn wrote on the novels, and Donald Mitchell and Clive James looked at his jazz criticism.", "Larkin's posthumous reputation was deeply affected by the publication in 1992 of Anthony Thwaite's edition of his letters and, the following year, his official biography, Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life by Andrew Motion.", "In 1982, as part of the celebrations for his sixtieth birthday, Larkin was the subject of The South Bank Show.

According to the advance blurb from the publisher, the novel concerns \"two men, Western contractors sent to work far from home, tasked with paving a road to the capital in a dangerous and largely lawless country.\" Reviews were mixed: positive notices included Andrew Motion writing in The Guardian that \"[Eggers'] novel may be sternly reduced in terms of its cast and language, but this leanness doesn't diminish the strength of its argument\", while Ron Charles in The Washington Post demurred that The Parade \"[is] a story that conforms to the West's reductive attitudes about the developing world. Writers and politicians have long generalized about those individual cultures. A novel that lumps them together into a nameless, primitive nation only plays into that tendency.\" The Parade was followed in November 2019 by another short novella, The Captain and the Glory, billed by Eggers himself as a \"allegorical satire\" of the Trump administration. In an interview with the publishers Knopf published on the McSweeney's website, Eggers described the novel as \"an attempt to understand this era by painting it in the gaudy and garish colors it really deserves... This is part farce, part parable, and I do hope, though the Captain bears more than a passing resemblance to Trump, that the book will be readable when Trump is gone. That's part of the reason I called it 'An entertainment' on the title page. It's a nod to Graham Greene but also the way I hope people will read it.
