For the first time in his life, Khan was financially well-off and brought his sister and mother to live with him in Bhopal. Khan married for the first time in 1860, to the daughter of the prime minister who was eleven years his senior. Siddiq Hasan Khan eventually married Begum on suggestion of his father-in-law (father of his first wife). Upon Shah Jahan's coronation in 1871, Khan was promoted to the position of chief secretary, began spending longer periods of time alone with Shah Jahan and the two were eventually married; with his second marriage, Khan had become the male consort of the female monarch.Alavi, pg. 6. According to Lepel Griffin, the marriage was in part to quash the rumor mongering, and officials made it clear that Khan was merely the Sultan's husband and would not function in any executive role.M. Khan, pg. 125. The marriage was controversial due to Indian beliefs regarding the remarriage of widows; ironically, the stated justification for support of the marriage by British officials - themselves predominantly Christians - was that Islam encourages widows to remarry. Despite remaining the spouse of the actual monarch, Khan's wife began to observe purdah and corresponded with male diplomats with Khan as her representative. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n B\u0113gum\u2019s daughter Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Jah\u0101n B\u0113gum was one of her stepfather\u2019s fiercest opponents, often labelling him as a \"Wahhabi\"; for forcing her mother to be in purdah. Khan's mother-in-law held rather negative reviews of her daughter's new husband, and there was friction between the two families.", "Siddiq Hasan's enemies in Bhopal state and other Muslim religious circles had often accused him of being a \"Wahhabi\", a label commonly employed by the colonial authorities to denote \"anti-British\" rebels, \"fanatic\", \"puritan\" etc. ; with the intention to eradicate his influence in Bhopal. The British authorities began to inspect Siddiq Hasan's books closely and discovered his treatises which elaborated his doctrines on Jihad. Furthermore, when they detected that 17 Wahhabi scholars from Najd had come to study in Bhopal under Khan's tutelage, the British suspected him of being part of a pan-Islamic anti-British conspiracy; extending across India, Egypt, Istanbul, and Mahdist Sudan. Wary of Khan's influential position in the Bhopal court, British Resident Sir Lepel Griffin deposed Khan in 1885; charging him with instigating Indian Muslims against the British administration. Siddiq Hasan Khan firmly denied any Wahhabi influence on the Indian reformists. Furthermore, Khan had directly criticised the Najdi Wahhabis for their religious fanaticism, which caused bloodshed among fellow Muslims. Despite this, the British dismissed all his titles and sentenced him to house-arrest until his death in 1890. He was forbidden to visit his wife Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n B\u0113gum during the day, but was permitted to spend the night in her palace, the T\u0101j Ma\u1e25al. Both before and after his removal from the royal court by the British in 1885, Shah Jahan defended her husband to the very end as shown in the meeting minutes of a heated, vehement exchange between herself and Sir Griffin.M. Khan, pg. 141. For her part, Shah Jahan denied that her husband held any executive power and merely advised her on some issues, arguing that the claims of her husband controlling her were based on jealousy on the part of her son-in-law and personal problems between Khan and Lepel.Khan, pg. 148.
