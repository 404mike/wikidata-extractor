Seven days later on 11 March 2020, Wallace set up a goal for Jonathan Obika to the score the only goal of the game, in a 1\u20130 win against Hearts, which turned out to the last game of the season and saw the opposition team relegated when the season was curtailed with the club finishing ninth place in the league because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

He had a brilliant start to his career at the County Ground, netting hat-tricks in each of his first two matches. He scored in the following two matches to set a club record of scoring in each of his first four games, which stood until it was matched in September 2014 by Jonathan Obika. Flourishing under Sam Allen's management, Morris finished the 1926\u201327 season with 48 goals from 43 league games (a club record which still stands as of 2018), but problems with the defence meant the Robins could only manage a fifth-place finish. He also became the first Swindon player to score five goals in a single game, which came in a win over Queens Park Rangers. He repeated the feat in a 5\u20131 demolition of Norwich City in April 1930. He also went on a run of scoring in 11 consecutive games during the season, scoring 19 goals."]}, {"page": "Rhoys Wiggins", "response": ["Wiggins began the 2012\u201313 season as first choice, but fractured metatarsals in his foot caused when he fell awkwardly in a match against Crystal Palace in mid-September kept him out until the reverse fixture against the same team four-and-a-half months later.
