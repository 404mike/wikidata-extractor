Robison invented the siren and also worked with James Watt on an early steam car. Following the French Revolution, Robison became disenchanted with elements of the Enlightenment. He authored Proofs of a Conspiracy in 1797\u2014a polemic accusing Freemasonry of being infiltrated by Weishaupt's Order of the Illuminati.

Others took a more positive view, including Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in a letter to James Madison that \"Barruel\u2019s own parts of the book are perfectly the ravings of a Bedlamite\" and considered Weishaupt as an \"enthusiastic Philanthropist\" who believed in the indefinite perfectibility of man and his intention was simply to \"reinstate natural religion, and by diffusing the light of his morality, to teach us to govern ourselves\"."]}, {"page": "James Watt", "response": ["In 1759, Watt's friend, John Robison, called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power.

Watt began to experiment with steam, though he had never seen an operating steam engine.  He tried constructing a model; it failed to work satisfactorily, but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject. He came to realise the importance of latent heat\u2014the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constant-temperature process\u2014in understanding the engine, which, unknown to Watt, his friend Joseph Black had previously discovered some years before.

In Barruel's view, the modern members of this occult movement had wrested control of the Order of Freemasons he deemed responsible for undermining popular morality and the Catholic religion. Barruel's ideas of a universal conspiracy were influenced by news of the contents of a tract, Proofs of a Conspiracy (1797), being written by a Scottish mathematician John Robison in London. According to Barruel, the French Enlightenment thinkers, commanding a membership of half a million followers in France, in turn pledged their blind allegiance to the Bavarian Illuminati under Adam Weishaupt. The Jews rarely figure in Barruel's 5 volume polemic, though several years later, a letter written by a putative Florentine army officer going under the name of J.B.
