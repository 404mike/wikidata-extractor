He played a role in the development of interferometry in Radio Astronomy, and later astronomical optical interferometry and lucky imaging. He made the first maps of the radio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy and the Perseus Cluster, and measured the properties of many active galaxies. In 1985 he performed the first Aperture Masking Interferometry observations, and then led the construction and operation of the Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope, and helped develop the lucky imaging method. In 2001 he was awarded the Jackson-Gwilt Medal for his technical contributions to the fields of interferometry and aperture synthesis.He matriculated as a member of Queens' College, Cambridge in 1949 and was a Life Fellow of the College from 1999 to his death in 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Betelgeuse", "response": [" But it was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Betelgeuse became a regular target for aperture masking interferometry, that breakthroughs occurred in visible-light and infrared imaging. Pioneered by John E. Baldwin and colleagues of the Cavendish Astrophysics Group, the new technique employed a small mask with several holes in the telescope pupil plane, converting the aperture into an ad hoc interferometric array."]}, {"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| John E.

This technique allows ground-based telescopes to reach the maximum possible resolution, allowing ground-based telescopes with large diameters to produce far greater resolution than does the Hubble Space Telescope. The principal limitation of the technique is that it is applicable only to relatively bright astronomical objects. A mask is placed over the telescope which only allows light through a small number of holes. This array of holes acts as a miniature astronomical interferometer. The method was developed by John E. Baldwin and collaborators in the Cavendish Astrophysics Group."]}, {"page": "Jackson-Gwilt Medal", "response": ["| John E.
