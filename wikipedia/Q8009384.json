Evans wrote British Libellulinae or Dragonflies (1845) which has 12 coloured plates. This seems to be a rare work of entomology. He also described a species of grasshopper from New South Wales. Very little is known about Evans. He gave his address in 1857 as 'Admiralty' and was a sailor in the Royal Navy. In 1848 he was Secretary of the Entomological Society of London. Between 1845 and 1847 he gave four gifts of Coleoptera to the British Museum (Natural History) (1845.132; 1846.113; 1847.45; 1847.85). Other insects were given at different times from various countries including North Africa and in 1870 and 1875 he sold a collection of British and foreign insects, and his library through James Francis Stephens.\nTaxa described by Evans include:\n\nBrachytron (1845)\nEphippithyta maculata (1847)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Entomological Society", "response": ["Secretary G. R. Gray resigned in the same year then and was replaced by J. O. Westwood. Under the impulse of this last entomologist, who had many functions, the society made great strides. It was in particular attended regularly by Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) on his return from the voyage on H.M.S. Beagle: he became a member of the council and vice-president in 1838. J. O. Westwood left his functions in 1848 and was replaced by Edward Doubleday (1810\u20131849) and William Frederick Evans. They in their turn were soon replaced. In 1849, a secretary charged to collect the minutes of the meetings was named in the person of John William Douglas (1814\u20131905), a position he kept until 1856. He was assisted in 1851-1852 by Henry Tibbats Stainton (1822\u20131892), in 1853-1854 by William Wing (1827\u20131855), in 1855-1856 by Edwin Shepherd who then replaced J.W. Douglas in his position. Edward Wesley Janson (1822\u201391), a natural history agent, publisher and entomologist was Curator of the Entomological Society collections from 1850\u201363 and librarian from 1863\u201374."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["***William Frederick Evans, British entomologist"]}, {"page": "Coeliadinae", "response": ["Coeliadinae is a subfamily of the skipper butterfly family (Hesperiidae).
