The film stars Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket, alongside David Kelly, Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, Missi Pyle, James Fox, Deep Roy, and Christopher Lee. The storyline follows Charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory.\nDevelopment for a second adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory began in 1991, which resulted in Warner Bros. providing the Dahl estate with total artistic control. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as Gary Ross, Rob Minkoff, Martin Scorsese, and Tom Shadyac had been involved, while actors Bill Murray, Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Adam Sandler, and many others, were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka. Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and Danny Elfman aboard. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory represents the first musical film directed by Burton and the first time since The Nightmare Before Christmas that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals.\nFilming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. Rather than using computer-generated environments, Burton primarily used built sets and practical effects, which he claimed was inspired by the book's emphasis on texture. Wonka's Chocolate Room was constructed on the 007 Stage at Pinewood, complete with a faux chocolate waterfall and river. Squirrels were trained from birth for Veruca Salt's demise. Actor Deep Roy performed each Oompa-Loompa individually rather than one performance duplicated digitally.\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory was released to positive contemporary critical reviews, with praise directed towards the visuals, set design, musical numbers, child stars, and Burton's direction. Depp's performance as Willy Wonka received a more polarized response, and the film has been graded more critically in the years since its release. The film was a box office success, grossing US$475 million and becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2005.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Julia", "response": ["*Julia Winter (born 1993), Swedish-British actress"]}, {"page": "Knivsta", "response": ["Famous residents of Knivsta include artist Carl Milles (born at \u00d6rby G\u00e5rd Lagga, his father was Emil \"mille\" Andersson).
