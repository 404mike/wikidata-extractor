He was born in India, which inspired much of his work.\nKipling's works of fiction include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901), and many short stories, including \"The Man Who Would Be King\" (1888). His poems include \"Mandalay\" (1890), \"Gunga Din\" (1890), \"The Gods of the Copybook Headings\" (1919), \"The White Man's Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands\" (1899), and \"If\u2014\" (1910). He is seen as an innovator in the art of the short story. His children's books are classics; one critic noted \"a versatile and luminous narrative gift.\"Kipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdom's most popular writers. Henry James said \"Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius, as distinct from fine intelligence, that I have ever known.\" In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, as the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and at 41, its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood, but declined both. Following his death in 1936, his ashes were interred at Poets' Corner, part of the South Transept of Westminster Abbey.\nKipling's subsequent reputation has changed with the political and social climate of the age. The contrasting views of him continued for much of the 20th century. Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote: \"[Kipling] is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced. That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albert Camus", "response": ["In 1957, Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. This came as a shock to him. He was anticipating Andr\u00e9 Malraux would win the prestigious award. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after Rudyard Kipling, who was 42. After this he began working on his autobiography Le Premier Homme (The First Man) in an attempt to examine \"moral learning\". He also turned to the theatre once more.  Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyevsky's novel Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris and was a critical success."]}, {"page": "Armadillo", "response": ["A whimsical account of The Beginning of the Armadillos is one of the chapters of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories 1902 children's book."]}, {"page": "Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny", "response": ["The 2005 movie Manderlay, directed by Lars von Trier, contains several references to the plot of Mahagonny. The most notable of these is the threat of a hurricane approaching the city during the first act. Von Trier's earlier movie Dogville, to which Manderlay is a sequel, was for a large part based on a song from Brecht's Threepenny Opera (\"Pirate Jenny\"). In the brothel scene in act 2 of Mahagonny, the choir sings a \"Song von Mandelay\". The play Happy End (1929) by Elisabeth Hauptmann, Brecht and Weill, also contains a song called \"Der Song von Mandelay\", which uses the same refrain as in the brothel scene of Mahagonny. Brecht's use of the name Mandelay/Mandalay was inspired by Rudyard Kipling's poem \"Mandalay\"."]}, {"page": "Bildungsroman", "response": ["* Kim, by Rudyard Kipling (1901) "]}, {"page": "Courtney Love", "response": ["Literature and poetry have often been a major influence on her songwriting; Love said she had \"always wanted to be a poet, but there was no money in it.\" She has named the works of T.S.

However, \"there was also a strong social and cultural dimension to it, which Rudyard Kipling termed the 'white man's burden'.\" One of the ways this was carried out was by religious proselytising, by, amongst others, the London Missionary Society, which was \"an agent of British cultural imperialism.\"Olson, JS.; Shadle, R., Historical Dictionary of the British Empire, Volume 2, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, p. 682. Another way, was by the imposition of educational material on the colonies for an \"imperial curriculum\". Robin A. Butlin writes, \"The promotion of empire through books, illustrative materials, and educational syllabuses was widespread, part of an education policy geared to cultural imperialism\".Bell, M., Geography and Imperialism, 1820\u20131940, Manchester University Press, 1995, p. 182. This was also true of science and technology in the empire. Douglas M. Peers and Nandini Gooptu note that \"Most scholars of colonial science in India now prefer to stress the ways in which science and technology worked in the service of colonialism, as both a 'tool of empire' in the practical sense and as a vehicle for cultural imperialism. In other words, science developed in India in ways that reflected colonial priorities, tending to benefit Europeans at the expense of Indians, while remaining dependent on and subservient to scientific authorities in the colonial metropolis.\"Peers, DM.; Gooptu, N., India and the British Empire, OUP Oxford, 2012. p. 192."]}, {"page": "Camel", "response": ["File:KiplingCamel3.gif|How the Camel Got His Hump (From Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories)"]}, {"page": "Chuck Jones", "response": ["Three of his works during this period were animated TV adaptations of short stories from Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli's Brothers, The White Seal and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.

As characters, elephants are most common in children's stories, in which they are generally cast as models of exemplary behaviour. They are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values. Many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to a close-knit community, such as \"The Elephant's Child\" from Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, Disney's Dumbo, and Kathryn and Byron Jackson's The Saggy Baggy Elephant.
