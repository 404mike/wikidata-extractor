Despite his lack of mountaineering or flying experience, he succeeded in flying from Britain to India, surreptitiously entering Tibet and climbing as high as 6,920 metres (22,703 ft) on Mount Everest. However, he died in his attempt, and his body was found the following year by a British expedition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 21", "response": ["*1898 \u2013 Maurice Wilson, English soldier, pilot, and mountaineer (d. 1934)"]}, {"page": "Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions", "response": ["*  Maurice Wilson, a British eccentric, stated his intention to summit Everest by himself. After only a few flying lessons, Wilson flew illegally from Britain to India, hiking through Darjeeling and into Tibet and with the help of Sherpa guides began his attempt. Wilson was not a climber and had no climbing equipment. He expected to transport himself to the summit with spiritual help and signal the monks at the Rongbuk monastery of his success with a shaving mirror. It is not believed he attained the North Col (7000\u00a0m). Maurice Wilson's body and his diary were found wrapped in a tent in 1935 by another British expedition. Although dumped into a crevasse below the North Col, his body has been rediscovered a number of times, including in 1960 by the Chinese expedition. Unlike Mallory's body, Wilson's has decayed because the temperature at the head of the East Rongbuk Glacier does rise above freezing."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["* Maurice Wilson (1898\u20131934), British soldier, mystic, mountaineer and aviator", "* Maurice Wilson (footballer), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Bradford", "response": ["* Maurice Wilson MC \u2013 (21 April 1898 \u2013 1934) British soldier, mystic, mountaineer and aviator who is known for his ill-fated attempt to climb Mount Everest alone in 1934.
