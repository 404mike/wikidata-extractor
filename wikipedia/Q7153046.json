Their idea was to collaborate with different artists on each new single, under the name The Assembly. With singer Feargal Sharkey, lead vocalist of The Undertones, they scored the top 5 UK hit \"Never Never\". Meanwhile, Clarke founded the label Reset Records with Radcliffe. During 1983 and 1984 he produced four singles, \"The Face of Dorian Gray\", \"I Just Want to Dance\", \"Claudette\", and \"Calling All Destroyers\" for his friend Robert Marlow, which were released on this label. They also produced an album, at first shelved but released in 1999, under the name The Peter Pan Effect. In 1985, another collaboration took place with Paul Quinn of Bourgie Bourgie; the result was the single \"One Day\" by Vince Clarke & Paul Quinn.

Produced by Dennis Bovell, the album was named with reference to the third album by The Velvet Underground. Again critically acclaimed, the album's blue-eyed soul influences presaged other 1980s Scottish acts taking inspiration from this genre, including Wet Wet Wet and Hue and Cry. The album's lead single \"What Presence!?\" was notable for a video by Derek Jarman but also failed to break the Top 40, peaking at 47, while prophetic single \"Lean Period\" just crept into the top 75. The album was promoted via 'The Artisans' tour in the Autumn of 1984, with Steve Skinner replacing Britten on guitar, but by this stage venues and crowds were becoming smaller (and a final London date in December 1984 was cancelled because of poor sales). Relations with Polydor became strained by the fact Orange Juice could not tour internationally because of Zeke Manyika's immigration status. At the same time, Collins' decision to release material with former schoolfriend Paul Quinn on Alan Horne's new Swampland Records record label further soured the relationship with Polydor."]}, {"page": "Craig Gannon", "response": ["In the mid-1990s he was in the initial line-up of Black Grape.Larkin, Colin (2007) The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Bish Bash Books He has played guitar with many other artists, including Terry Hall, Roddy Frame, Alison Moyet, Denise Van Outen, Edwyn Collins, and Paul Quinn.
