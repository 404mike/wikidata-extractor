Burchett's pupils included the extremely varied talents of Kate Greenaway, Christopher Dresser, Elizabeth Thompson (Lady Butler), Sir George Clausen, Sir Luke Fildes, Gertrude Jekyll, Hubert von Herkomer, Evelyn De Morgan, William Harbutt and Helen Allingham.  Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, Queen Victoria's daughter, and a talented artist, was also a student.As an artist he achieved some reputation for large history paintings, and decorated public buildings including parts of the Palace of Westminster and the Victoria and Albert Museum, but his View across Sandown Bay, Isle of Wight is seen by modern art historians as his best work.  Burchett published collections of his lectures as text-books for the South Kensington system of art education, which he helped to devise.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Palace of Westminster", "response": ["The theme of the Prince's Chamber is Tudor history, and 28 oil portraits painted on panels around the room depict members of the Tudor dynasty. They are the work of Richard Burchett and his pupils, and their creation entailed extensive research, which contributed to the founding of the National Portrait Gallery in 1856. 12 bronze bas-reliefs are set into the wall below the portraits, executed by William Theed in 1855\u20131857. Scenes included are The Field of the Cloth of Gold, The Escape of Mary, Queen of Scots and Raleigh Spreading His Cloak As a Carpet for the Queen.Guide to the Palace of Westminster, pp. 32\u201333. Above the portraits, at window level, there are compartments intended for copies of six of the ten Armada tapestries, which hung in the chamber of the House of Lords until their destruction in the 1834 fire and depicted the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. The project was put on hold in 1861 (by which time only one painting had been completed), and was not revived until 2007; , all six paintings have been finished and are on display in the Royal Gallery.

Burchett was headmaster of the \"South Kensington Schools\", now the Royal College of Art, which gradually replaced the Royal Academy School as the leading British art school, though around the start of the 20th century the Slade School of Fine Art produced many of the forward-looking artists.Frayling, 12-64"]}, {"page": "Owen Jones (architect)", "response": ["Through his work at the Great Exhibition, Jones developed a close working relationship with the civil servant Henry Cole (1808\u20131882) who went on to become the first director of the South Kensington Museum (later to become the V&A).
