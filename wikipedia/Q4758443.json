In 1935 she was recommended to the NKVD (forerunner of the KGB) by Andrew Rothstein, a leading member of the CPGB, and became a full agent in 1937.  In the same year, the Norwoods bought their semi-detached house in Bexleyheath, which was at that time a town in Kent; there they led an apparently unremarkable life together, and Melita Norwood would continue to live there until she was 90."]}, {"page": "John Bryan", "response": ["As pen name: John Bryan was used as a pen name by Andrew Rothstein"]}, {"page": "Rothstein", "response": ["*Andrew Rothstein (1898-1994), Russian-British journalist"]}, {"page": "Workers' Weekly (UK)", "response": ["In the Spring of 1923, the Communist Party of Great Britain felt itself at low ebb.
