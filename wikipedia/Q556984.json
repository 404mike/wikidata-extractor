Lyrically, the song is a comment on Bruce Springsteen's use of romantic metaphors in his songs. It is often seen as indicating a personal distaste for Springsteen, but McAloon elaborated on the lyrics in a 1992 interview; \"The point of the parody is this: not that I think Bruce Springsteen is crap, it's that I think a lot of his audience get into him on a patriotic level that he doesn't intend. They misinterpret him, their enjoyment of him is inaccurate, all very imperialist American. I wanted to write a song about someone who was thick white trash, listening to Springsteen, and saying 'But our lives aren't like that'\". \"Cars and Girls\" was released as the album's lead single but flopped, only reaching number 44. Nevertheless, it has become one of the band's best-known songs. Paddy McAloon has described \"Enchanted\" as being about \"finding something to be excited about, year after year\". Thomas Dolby suggested Prince should produce the track, but the album's sound engineer David Leonard failed to find Prince at Sunset Sound Recorders to approach him. McAloon sampled the opening bass run of Glen Campbell's recording of \"Wichita Lineman\" for the song's bassline.", "\"The Golden Calf\" was self-produced by Paddy McAloon. It is one of the earliest-written songs Prefab Sprout have released, having been composed in 1977 when the band was a guitar-based trio who made music McAloon would describe as \"heavy metal meeting disco\". McAloon described recording the song for the album as \"like doing a cover version because I don\u2019t remember what it was about\". McAloon sings in a less breathy tone than usual on the track, which he felt Thomas Dolby would not have allowed and was more in line with his vocals from Swoon. \"The Golden Calf\" has been described by Andreas Hub of Fachblatt as \"a real rocker\" and has garnered comparisons to the work of Pete Townshend, Marc Bolan and Del Amitri. The song was offered to American album-oriented rock radio stations by Epic in advance promotion of the album. \"The Golden Calf\" was released as the album's fifth and final single, and promoted by the band with a performance on the children's television programmes Going Live! and Get Fresh. It charted at number 82 in the UK.", "The album's commercial success brought with it an uncomfortable level of recognition for Paddy McAloon, who would later recollect \"I was asked for autographs, girls wanted to put their hands in my hair, touch me... ...the glamorous aspect of our music has always been for me a way of showing how we as individuals are the opposite of this glittering world.\". Despite demand from fans and CBS, Prefab Sprout did not tour the album as McAloon did not want to sacrifice what he described as \"the best time of my life for writing\", stating \"I know that if I go on the road I'll just end up writing in the same way as everyone else.\". In interviews surrounding the album's release, McAloon alluded to two new projects he was working on \u2013 a Christmas album called Total Snow and a musical about the fictional masked vigilante Zorro called Zorro the Fox. As of 2022, neither of these projects have materialised.", "From Langley Park to Memphis received mixed reviews. Rolling Stone's Peter Wilkinson described the album as \"overreaching\", elaborating \"McAloon tries leavening disjointed talk with instrumental gimmickry. Songs built around McAloon's guitar are lost in a swirl of strings and the noodlings of no less than five engineers and four producers\". Dave Rimmer of Q considered it \"probably their best album yet\" but found \"The King of Rock 'n' Roll\" \"a mite irritating\". He felt that \"the only true duff part is the overblown imagery of 'Golden Calf'\". NMEs Len Brown was not enamoured with the album's production style, calling it \"sickly\" and \"cluttered\". He considered the album \"a largely bland affair\", but praised \"Cars and Girls\" and \"Nancy (Let Your Hair Down for Me)\". Creems Kurt B. Riley was critical of the album, feeling that the songwriting was \"done a great disservice by ill-fitting arrangements\". Melody Makers David Stubbs felt it was \"less strong\" than Steve McQueen but \"more ambitious\". Vogues Barney Hoskyns commented \"at least seven of its 10 songs are more accessible, more ravishingly beautiful than anything McAloon has written\". Both Record Mirror and Hot Press ranked the album number 5 in their \"Albums of the Year\" list. Additionally, the album was included in \"Albums of the Year\" lists in Q, The Village Voice, Musikexpress, Spex and Rockdelux. Dave DiMartino of Billboard ranked the album his fifth favourite of the year, commenting \"Paddy McAloon has seen the future of rock and roll - and has returned bearing the names of Jimmy Webb, Cole Porter and absolutely no songs about cars 'n' girls\".

Trouser Press, meanwhile, highlighted the record's mellifluous, refined sound. Reviewing the album upon its reissue in 1993, Selects Stuart Maconie considered the album the band's weakest, deeming it \"full of entertaining ideas but more than a little tricksy and smart Alec\", but felt \"Cruel\" and \"Elegance\" made the album \"well worth owning\".
