Leader Sound, 1971: LEA 4006 He learned the instrument from several pipers including Tom and Henry Clough as well as Richard Mowat, but, according to Tommy Breckons, Batey of Stannington was his main teacher. Tommy later quoted Billy's reminiscences of the informal sessions at the Cloughs' and others: When he lived at Blagdon, he used to bike down to Clough's. There were fourteen or fifteen pipers all living in that area, and they took turns to play at each other's houses, including Billy's. Billy told him that when he first went to one of these sessions there were fourteen pipers in the house, ..., and everyone was better than me! By God..., there were some good pipers. But all I had to dee was practice and get up alongside them.Some Memories, Tommy Breckons, Northumbrian Pipers' Society Magazine, v.18, 1997 He learned by ear at this stage, and when he won a learners' competition in 1923, it was noted that he played the Barrington Hornpipe, but not quite as it is written. An early photograph of him from 1924, with a new set of pipes, is at the Woodhorn Museum website - he had won a Learners' Competition organised by William Cocks in this year, when he had been playing for three and a half years. The pipes in the photograph are the set made by Cocks, and offered as a trophy in the Competition. Billy went on to win these pipes outright in 1927. After he won the Spencer Cup at Bellingham Show in 1928, Cocks recorded that he was debarred from most contests, 'to give other pipers a chance'. At this time he must certainly have been playing in the traditional staccato style characteristic of the instrument, though in later years his style was much freer."]}, {"page": "Tom Clough", "response": ["Tom Clough was an influential teacher of the pipes, though at an advanced level: his pupil Tommy Breckons recalled learning first from ", "G.G.

Armstrong's \u2013 Armstrong had learned from the Clough family. These exercises consisted of scales and arpeggios \u2013 the pupil would have to start slowly, and increase speed till mistakes happened. Another group of exercises, based on variation sets, are all found in the four tunes Fenwick of Bywell, Jacky Layton, Felton Lonnen and Oh dear, what can the matter be.  He also gave a description of Tom Clough's meticulous teaching technique: \"He made you break a tune down and play it bar by bar. If there was a bar bothering you, you played that bar until you got it right. Then you put the bars together, then put the measure together, and then eventually the tune together. Finally you could start at the beginning and go through it.\"", "Tommy Breckons also recalled his friend Billy Pigg's recollection of playing at a regular session at Tom Clough's: "]}, {"page": "Joe Hutton (piper)", "response": ["Hutton was born in Halton Lea Gate, near Haltwhistle in the west of Northumberland.Ranting and Reeling, Topic TSCD 669, notes by Reg Hall.'Joe Hutton of Coquetdale', Mike Tickell, NPS Magazine, v.1, 1980. Like his father, Jake, he was a shepherd, and a musician - he started on the fiddle, but took up the Northumbrian smallpipes after hearing P.J. Liddell and G.G. Armstrong playing at a concert in 1936. He started on a James Reid set from Halton Lea Gate, refurbished by G.G. Armstrong, a noted piper from Hexham, and he took lessons in the instrument from  Armstrong.  He made rapid progress, and won a competition as a novice, the following year. Armstrong made him a new set of pipes in January 1938,G.G. Armstrong's record book, David Geddes, Northumbrian Pipers' Society Magazine, v. 19, 1998. and Joe was photographed, standing at the left, with other competitors at the Bellingham Show piping competition in 1938.  He continued to play the fiddle at dances during the war years, but he continued piping, upgrading to a 17-keyed chanter, again by Armstrong, in 1943. In 1950 he began piping in competitions again, winning all the Open competitions for two years. He was very isolated living out on the border with Cumberland, and to play with Tommy Breckons, a noted piper from Bellingham, he recalled \"it meant walking 8 miles to Gilsland, bus to Hexham, another bus to Bellingham....Man, it was a day's work getting there\". On another such piping trip, to Carrawbrough on the Roman Wall, he met his future wife, Hannah, whose brother John was also a piper.", "In 1955, he obtained, from Tommy Breckons, a fine 17-keyed ivory and silver set of pipes. These had previously belonged to P.J Liddell, and are widely believed to have been made by T. Errington Thompson, of Sewingshields, about 1870. He played this set, the first set he had ever heard, for the rest of his life. In 1978,  he retired from farming and settled in Rothbury, in the centre of the county. This enabled him to concentrate much more on piping, at a time of growing interest in the instrument and its traditional music.Obituary, by Graham Wells, The Guardian, July 1995."]}, {"page": "G. G. Armstrong", "response": ["He taught 36 pupils, including Joe Hutton, Tommy Breckons and Colin Caisley, and passed on his pipemaking skills to William Cocks. Some of his teaching was for Scout troops \u2013 the Northumbrian Pipers' Society led a move to introduce the instrument among Scouts in Northumberland between the wars. From the playing of these and other pupils, it is clear that Armstrong must have been not only a fine piper but an excellent teacher. Tommy Breckons recalled learning first from Armstrong, and later from Tom Clough: \"Now as to the difference between Tom and George. Tom wouldn't have  been much use to a novice piper....
