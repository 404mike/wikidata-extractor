He was educated at Rugby School and Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating M.A. in 1793.From 1796 to 1812, he was Tory Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury and for Marlborough from 1814 to 1818.He held command, as major, of the Shrewsbury Yeomanry Cavalry from its inception in 1798 until 1804, when the command was handed to Charles Dallas, and of the Shropshire Militia as lieutenant-colonel from 1801 to 1814, although diplomatic duty abroad took him away from duty in this country.Hill went to France as attach\u00e9 to the British charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Paris in November 1801, and was on duty during the truce brought about by the Peace of Amiens.  When war with Napoleon resumed he was briefly in captivity but escaped to England. In 1805, Hill was appointed ambassador to Ratisbon (though the Napoleonic Wars prevented him from taking up office), to the Kingdom of Sardinia, whose court was exiled by the war in Cagliari in 1807 and at Turin in 1814 following Napoleon's defeat, and to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at Naples in 1824. That same year he and his younger brother assumed the additional surname of Noel, from his grandfather, and was created a Privy Councillor. In 1822, he had rejected George Canning's offer of the post of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\nIn 1832, he inherited the barony of Berwick from his childless older brother, Thomas. Although he was briefly engaged to Lady Hester Stanhope, he died unmarried and without legitimate issue at Red Rice, Hampshire, in 1842, aged sixty-eight, and his title passed to his younger brother, Richard. He was buried in the family vault at St Eata's parish church, Atcham.", "link_mentions": {}}}
