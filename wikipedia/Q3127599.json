Circa 1880, he abandoned this to \nwork at Thomas Cooke and Sons of York, a company which produced the finest quality optical instruments, telescopes in particular.\nAs optical manager and chief designer for Thomas Cooke, he won fame for the design and patent in 1893 of the Cooke Triplet and was awarded the Duddell Medal and Prize in 1933.He had married Charlotte Fernandes Barff on 24 July 1888. They had one daughter, Doris, and two sons, Leslie and Edward. Their son Edward was also a published optical designer. He died in retirement in Coxwold, North Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anti-reflective coating", "response": ["As mentioned above, natural index-matching \"coatings\" were discovered by Lord Rayleigh in 1886.

Harold Taylor's (UK, not related to the Taylors of T, T & H) Cooke Triplet was a deceptively simple looking asymmetric three element anastigmat formula created by reexamining lens design from first principles to take maximum advantage of the advances in new Schott optical glasses. The elements were all of such strong power that they were highly sensitive to misalignment and required tight manufacturing tolerances for the era.Kingslake, pp 103-106.", "In 1886/1890 the natural phenomenon was noticed by Lord Rayleigh (Rayleigh's Film) and later by Dennis Taylor in 1896, that some lenses with glass tarnished by age counter-intuitively produced brighter images.
