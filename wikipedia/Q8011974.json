On 28 June 1926 he was appointed by the Home Secretary, William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford, to sit on a commission which had been established to enquire into the conditions of mining and drainage in the county borough Doncaster in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The commission was a tribunal of inquiry as established by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act of 1921 and was to establish what effect mining had had on drainage in the area, what the current efficiency of land drainage systems was and how best to manage the issue in the future.  At the time of the inquiry Ellis was a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, and hence entitled to use the title of \"Sir\".
