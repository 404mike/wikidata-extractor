In his single match for the first team against Derbyshire at Derby, he made 7 and 12 batting at No 10, took one catch, but failed to take a wicket with his bowling. He played fairly regularly for Somerset's Second Eleven in the Second Eleven Championship and the Minor Counties, taking 30 wickets in the season. He suffered an injury at the end of the season and had to stop playing and return to Australia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin McCool", "response": ["He married Dorothy Everlyn Yabsley in 1943 in Sydney.Dorothy McCool's middle name is cited in the entry for Russel McCool in this directory:  His son, Russ McCool, who was born in Taunton, played one first-class match for Somerset in 1982, in addition to playing for New South Wales Colts and New South Wales Country."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Russ McCool (1982) 1 match CA"]}, {"page": "Russel McCool", "response": ["#REDIRECT Russ McCool"]}]}}
