He played for Celtic, Blackpool, Hull City, Gateshead, Coleraine and East Stirlingshire.\nBuchan signed professional forms with Celtic in 1933 and spent four years with the Glasgow club, winning the Scottish League Division One championship with them in 1935\u201336 and the Scottish Cup in 1937.\nIn 1937, Buchan signed for Joe Smith's Blackpool for \u00a310,000, then a record transfer fee involving a Scottish club, making his debut on 20 November 1937 in a 2\u20130 defeat at local rivals Preston North End. He scored his first goals for the club two games later, in a 2\u20132 draw at Middlesbrough on 4 December. He went on to score ten more goals in the 23 remaining games of the league season and, with his total twelve goals, finished joint-top scorer with Bobby Finan (see Blackpool F.C. season 1937\u201338).\nThe following season, 1938\u201339, he finished joint-top scorer again, this time with new signing Jock Dodds, the pair scoring ten goals apiece. During the first of six seasons of inter-war football that followed, Buchan returned to Glasgow in an attempt to re-join Celtic, but the club showed little enthusiasm. He instead joined his local team, Stenhousemuir, as a guest player. When the club closed down for the duration of the war, Buchan returned to England to become a PT instructor in the Royal Air Force. Buchan made one appearance for Scotland in a wartime international.At the end of the war, Buchan returned to Blackpool. In Buchan's final season at the seaside, 1947\u201348, he made fourteen appearances in a start-stop season, his place in the line-up restricted due to the form of Stan Mortensen, Stanley Matthews and Ernie Taylor. His four goals game in two games: two in a 2\u20132 draw with Wolves on 6 September 1947, and two (one a penalty) in a 3\u20131 victory over Charlton Athletic at Bloomfield Road on 29 November. His final appearance for the club occurred on 1 May 1948, the final day of the league season, in a 7\u20130 demolition of Preston North End at Deepdale.\nBuchan joined Hull for the start of the 1948\u201349 campaign. In his only season with the club, he made forty league appearances, scoring twelve goals.\nIn 1949, he joined Gateshead, with whom he made 88 league appearances and scored 16 goals. After a short spell as player-manager of Northern Irish club Coleraine, Buchan finished his career in his native Scotland with East Stirlingshire.\nBuchan died on 6 July 2003, aged 88.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coleraine F.C.", "response": ["* Willie Buchan (1953 \u2013 1954)"]}, {"page": "Jimmy McMenemy", "response": ["After retiring from playing, McMenemy spent some years away from football and spent time as a publican.
