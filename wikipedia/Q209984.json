Following the war, Mallory became a pony trotting circuit in the late 1940s, which defined the outline of the oval track still in use today. After the financial collapse of the equestrian club responsible for the circuit (Kirkby Mallory Racing Association), the track was hired by various motorcycle clubs for grass track motorcycle and motorcycle sidecar racing.  For example, between September 1949 until 1954, the Leicester Query Motorcycle Club held grass track races. In 1955, the estate was purchased by Clive Wormleighton, under whose influence, the present tarmac was constructed at a cost of \u00a360,000 in 1956. Upon completion of the building work, a circuit test was held on 26 April, when local Grand Prix driver Bob Gerard and Maurice Cann respectively conducted a Cooper-Bristol Formula Two car and a Moto Guzzi motorcycle around the track, Gerard managing an 81\u00a0mph lap.Peter Swinger, \"Motor Racing Circuits in England : Then & Now\" (Ian Allan Publishing, , 2008)"]}, {"page": "Manx Grand Prix", "response": ["|Craig Atkinson, Gordon Blackley, Andrew Brady, Eric Briggs, Jimmy Buchan, Maurice Cann, James Courtney, Don Crossley, Barry Davidson, Tony Duncan, Chris Fargher, Jack Findlay, Alan Holmes, Tim Hunt, Tom Knight, Norman Kneen, Eric Lea, George Lindsay, Oliver Linsdell, Phillip McCallen, Dave Milling, Bernard Murray, Len Randles, Michael Russell, Craig Ryding, Dan Sayle, Martin Sharpe, Michael Sweeney, Geoff Tanner, Malcolm Uphill, Brian Venables, Clive Watts, Barry Wood, Buddy Yeardsley, Nathan Harrison"]}, {"page": "1950 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season", "response": ["|  Maurice Cann", "|align=\"left\"|  Maurice Cann", "|  Maurice Cann"]}, {"page": "1951 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season", "response": ["|  Maurice Cann"]}, {"page": "1952 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season", "response": ["|  Maurice Cann", "|  Maurice Cann"]}, {"page": "Ulster Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Maurice Cann", "|  Maurice Cann", "|  Maurice Cann", "|  Maurice Cann"]}, {"page": "1948 Isle of Man TT", "response": ["Artie Bell also came third in the Junior TT with Freddie Frith taking the flag for first place, and A.
