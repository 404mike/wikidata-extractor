His one-month loan was later extended to the end of the season and he played every minute of the 10 Cheltenham matches that his loan period covered. Manager Keith Downing said that he was \"very pleased\" with Keogh's performances, calling him a \"tremendous asset\" who \"strengthened the defence\" and formed a partnership at centre-back with Shane Duff that was as good as any in the League. Keogh helped the club to four wins and two draws, The Robins finished 19th and three points above the relegation zone. In July 2008, with Keogh out of contract at the end of the season, clubs began to show an interest in signing him, though due to his age City were entitled to compensation. Keogh was again offered a new contract but the club openly admitted that they expected him to leave, with newly promoted Championship club Doncaster Rovers and League One clubs Southend United and Carlisle United interested in signing him.", "Keogh captained Ireland for the second time on 31 May 2016 in the 2\u20131 home defeat to Belarus.
