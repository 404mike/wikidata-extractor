Within a few months the band solidified their line-up, adding Austin Dickinson (formerly of The Oath and son of Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson) on vocals after their respective bands played a show together at the \"Tufnell Park Dome\" and began playing local gigs as well as travelling across the UK, seeking out more shows. Halide recorded one three-track EP, which saw a viral release through their Myspace. This eventually garnered attention from more legitimate local promoters, who granted the band further exposure by putting them on at slightly higher profile shows, namely with Biomechanical and other local heavyweights such as Eternal Lord and Exit Ten. The band then organised a UK tour, with them and local act Terrorlapse, as well as playing one-off supports to their peers in bands such as Viatrophy, Sylosis, Anterior and Malefice. In early 2008, whilst playing the Islington Academy supporting Sylosis, the band were offered the opening slot on the smaller, third stage of the Download Festival at Donington Park at 10:45 am. This opportunity lead to the band changing members, adding Joe Copcutt on bass and Pat Lundy on drums (both formerly of 12 Ton Method), and their name, switching from Halide, to Rise to Remain. However, they still retained early songs that would later be recorded for Rise to Remain, namely Purify, Illusive Existence, Salvation and Fracture.", "After concluding the tour supporting Trivium and In Flames, Rise to Remain closed their touring commitments for 2011. Starting on 15 January 2012, Rise to Remain were meant to support Machine Head on their North American tour along with Suicide Silence and Darkest Hour in support. However, on 6 January 2012, bassist Joe Copcutt and drummer Pat Lundy announced their departure from the band, made public by the Rocksound and Blabbermouth websites. Lundy is now the drummer for the Welsh post-hardcore band Funeral for a Friend and Copcutt now plays bass in the British-Canadian supergroup AxeWound. Consequently, the band had to pull out from the Machine Head US Tour. City of Vultures was due to have been released in North America on 24 January, coinciding with the Machine Head US Tour.", "* Joe Copcutt \u2013 bass (2008\u20132012)", " bar:Joe     text:\"Joe Copcutt\""]}, {"page": "AxeWound", "response": ["AxeWound is a British-Canadian heavy metal band formed in 2012 comprising Liam Cormier of Cancer Bats on lead vocals, Matthew Tuck of Bullet for My Valentine on guitar and backing vocals, Mike Kingswood of Glamour of the Kill on guitar, Joe Copcutt of Zoax and formerly of Rise to Remain playing bass and Jason Bowld of Pitchshifter and Bullet for My Valentine on drums.", "*Joe Copcutt \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Matthew Tuck", "response": ["Tuck is also the backing vocalist and rhythm guitarist in the supergroup AxeWound.
