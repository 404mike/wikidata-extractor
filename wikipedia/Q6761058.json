Arsenal were level within five minutes, as Kelly Smith curled home a 25-yard free-kick after being hacked down by Charlton's right-back Maria Bertelli. The Gunners were in front by the quarter hour after winning a free kick near the corner flag: Jayne Ludlow was the quickest to get to Lianne Sanderson's near post cross and she steered her shot underneath goalkeeper Toni-Anne Wayne. Ludlow then claimed her second goal in first-half stoppage-time with a 30-yard strike which flew into the top corner of the net."]}]}}
