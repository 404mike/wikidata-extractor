His name is given to the Sewel motion, parliamentary device passed by the Scottish Parliament, in which it agrees that the United Kingdom parliament may pass legislation on a devolved issue extending to Scotland, over which the Scottish Parliament has regular legislative authority. He left ministerial office in 1999 upon the new Parliament taking over the majority of the Scottish Office's functions. Sewel left the House of Lords in 2015 after photos of him doing drugs emerged.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swansea University", "response": ["* John Sewel, Baron Sewel, former Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords"]}, {"page": "List of barons in the peerages of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["#*John Sewel, Baron Sewel"]}, {"page": "Baron Sewel", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Sewel, Baron Sewel"]}, {"page": "Lord Sewel", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Sewel, Baron Sewel"]}, {"page": "John Buttifant Sewel, Baron Sewel", "response": ["#REDIRECTJohn Sewel, Baron Sewel"]}, {"page": "John Buttifant Sewel", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Sewel, Baron Sewel"]}, {"page": "John Sewel", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Sewel, Baron Sewel"]}, {"page": "Sewel", "response": ["*John Sewel, Baron Sewel, member of the British House of Lords"]}, {"page": "John Sewell (disambiguation)", "response": ["*John Sewel, Baron Sewel (born 1946), British academic and politician"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the campaign for Scottish devolution", "response": ["* John Sewel, Baron Sewel"]}, {"page": "Hanson School", "response": ["* John Sewel, Baron Sewel CBE, leader of Aberdeen Council from 1977\u201380, and President from 1982\u201384 of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities"]}, {"page": "Senior Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords", "response": ["*John Sewel, Baron Sewel, 2012\u20132015"]}, {"page": "List of elected British politicians who have changed party affiliation", "response": ["|John Sewel, Baron Sewel"]}, {"page": "Lord Sewell", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Sewel, Baron Sewel"]}]}}
