He was short and prematurely balding; slow and deliberate of speech; and his voice, the quality of which had been spoiled by snuff-taking, had a strong Somerset accent. His character is described by the Coleridge scholar Molly Lefebure as combining \"idealism with strong practical common-sense, sound business acumen with a keen and stimulating intellect, and a robust sense of humour with great delicacy of feeling\". This last characteristic was not invariable for he could be sententious and overbearing, so that his long-term friend Southey complained that \"he was never content to be your friend, but he must be your saviour\", nor was his temper to be implicitly relied on. He owes his place in literary history to his profound respect for the intellectual elite of his time, which, combined with his many fine personal qualities, enabled him to be an invaluable friend to Coleridge and others, and to live up to his own maxim, \"Happy is the genius who has a friend ever near of good sense\"."]}, {"page": "Murder on the Home Front", "response": ["Murder on the Home Front is a two-part British television crime drama, written by David Kane and directed by Geoffrey Sax, that first broadcast on ITV on 9 May 2013.
