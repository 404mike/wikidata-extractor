It was created by Maureen Chadwick and Ann McManus of Shed Productions, who initiated the idea of developing a series primarily focusing on the inmates and staff of the fictional women's prison, Larkhall, located in the South London region. Following the success of previous series Within These Walls and the Australian-imported Prisoner: Cell Block H, both of which screened on ITV, Bad Girls was commissioned by the network and was viewed as a realistic, modern portrayal of life in a women's prison. The series featured a large ensemble cast, including Linda Henry, Claire King, Simone Lahbib, Mandana Jones, Debra Stephenson, Jack Ellis, Alicya Eyo, Helen Fraser, Kika Mirylees, Victoria Alcock, James Gaddas, Victoria Bush, Dannielle Brent and Liz May Brice.", "* Victoria Alcock as Julie Saunders (Series 1\u20138)"]}, {"page": "Ian Beale", "response": ["Feeling dejected, Ian goes to a strip club in August 2011 and is stunned to see Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) being thrown out.

They begin a relationship, realising that they both yearn for someone to love them, and Mandy accepts Ian's impromptu marriage proposal. Following the death of relative Pat Evans (Pam St Clement), Ian's daughter Lucy returns to Walford, angry at Ian for not telling her about Pat's death. She decides to move in with her father and takes a disliking to Mandy. The relationship is marred by Mandy's one-night stand with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), Ian's insecurities, interference from Mandy's abusive mother Lorraine Stevens (Victoria Alcock), and Lucy's hatred of Mandy.

After a 17-year hiatus, Mandy reappeared from 29 August 2011 and began a relationship with the long-running character, Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). Mandy's return storylines focused on her dysfunctional relationship with her mother Lorraine (Victoria Alcock), her unconventional engagement to Ian, and her fuelling conflict with Ian's daughter Lucy (Hetti Bywater). On 4 April 2012, it was announced that Stapleton would be leaving EastEnders for a second time. Mandy and Ian were not given a happy ending; their relationship dissolved and Mandy departed in the episode broadcast on 31 May 2012.", "In January 2012, Ian discovers Ricky and Mandy's tryst; the revelation ends Ricky's marriage to Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer). Mandy confesses to Ian that she became pregnant with Ricky's child in January 1994 and gave birth to a premature daughter, Kira, who died. She suggests she had sex with Ricky because of unresolved feelings for her dead daughter. Ian forgives Mandy but further problems arise when Ian's daughter Lucy (Hetti Bywater) returns to Walford and takes a dislike to Mandy. Lucy attempts to turn Ian against Mandy by setting her up, poisoning Bobby's mind against her and sabotaging Mandy's wedding plans. When Lucy discovers Mandy texting someone called \"L Stevens\", she suspects Mandy is having an affair and arranges for \"L\" to visit, not realising \"L\" stands for Lorraine, Mandy's estranged, alcoholic mother (now played by Victoria Alcock). Seeing an opportunity to make use of Ian's resources, Lorraine convinces him that she wants to bond with Mandy, but when he is absent she verbally and physically abuses Mandy. Lorraine's true nature is eventually revealed and Ian sends her away, but her stirring nearly causes Mandy and Ian's relationship to end. When a sickly Lorraine returns to Walford, Ian forbids Mandy from caring for her. Secretly, Mandy visits Lorraine in hospital and they briefly bond, but Lorraine turns nasty again when Mandy disobeys her, telling her that she has never loved or wanted her. A few weeks later, Mandy is devastated to learn that Lorraine has died. Ian, who is going through financial difficulties and is behaving erratically, refuses to let Mandy grieve and goes ahead with his plans to bring their wedding forward. On their wedding day, Mandy is perturbed by Ian's increasingly strange behaviour and refuses to marry him, revealing that she has been forcing herself to love him. Ian begs her to stay but Mandy leaves as a devastated Ian shouts her name. Ian suffers a breakdown and absconds shortly after without telling his family where he is going. When Lucy discovers Ian's credit card being used in a Rochester hotel a week later, she and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) go in search of him. They find Mandy, who has been using Ian's credit card to pay for her mother's funeral. Mandy denies knowing where Ian is. She vows to make a success of her life, stating it is \"time to grow up\".", "Lucy's vendetta against Mandy leads to the reintroduction of Mandy's estranged mother Lorraine, who appeared from March 2012. Linda Henry played Lorraine originally from 1991 to 1992 but Henry was already appearing in EastEnders as a different character, Shirley Carter, so the role of Lorraine was recast to actress Victoria Alcock. Described as a bad mother who allowed Mandy to \"run wild on the streets\" in her teenage years, it was suggested that Lorraine had not altered and remained a \"brash\" character. Lorraine's return was scripted to cause problems in Mandy's relationship with Ian and, according to Alcock, it was also intended to give viewers an insight into why Mandy turned out the way she had. Discussing Lorraine and Mandy's relationship Alcock said, \"We've obviously seen Mandy go through hell and back. She's had her moments, and once you meet her mother, you understand how this poor girl has ended up like she is. Poor little love didn't stand a chance with a mother like [Lorraine]\". Alcock added, \"Many Albert Square residents didn't think there was a bigger leech than Mandy, but we see where she gets it from now. She has no qualms and she's proud of it. Allegedly she let some awful things happen to Mandy, which may come out in time. I think viewers are interested in the broken shells of a character and she's definitely a broken shell. You're not just made that way, something happens to make you like that. I reckon she was abused, and the abused often then become the abuser, and unfortunately that vicious circle has not been broken. I've tried to play her with a few levels.\" Stapleton added that \"Lorraine puts on a big act for Ian. Mandy can see straight through her, but Ian doesn't understand why she's getting her knickers in a twist. When Lorraine's alone with Mandy, she's really cruel and cold. But she's very careful how she acts in front of everyone else.\" Stapleton was unsure whether this storyline would ultimately change viewer perception of Mandy: \"When you play a really prickly character like Mandy, it's nice to take a look at why they behave like that. Whether it'll make viewers warm to her, I don't know. People love Mandy when she's awful!\". Stapleton suggested that Mandy was petrified of Lorraine and she described scenes between the characters as dark and violent. Scenes airing in May 2012 where Lorraine informs Mandy that she never loved her were described by Stapleton as challenging and emotional to film. The storyline ended bleakly with Lorraine dying before Mandy could make amends with her mother."]}, {"page": "Jim Fenner", "response": ["Fenner is murdered in the same hanging cell where Yvonne died.

When Natalie confesses to being a pedophile, Frances slaps her, just as Colin Hedges (Tristan Surrock) walks into her office. Following a fight with Al McKenzie (Pauline Campbell), in which Natalie stamps on Al with her high heels after Al brandished a straight razor, Natalie manipulates her into thinking that her boyfriend had actually abused the children.

After Phyl and Bev make rhubarb hootch, which results in Al dying, Natalie blackmails them and forces them to poison Frances with it; the attempt fails, however.
