Intended to secure Quebec City against the Americans and serve as a refuge for the British garrison in the event of attack or rebellion, the Citadelle incorporated a section of the French enceinte of 1745 and the layout was based on S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban's design for an arms, munitions, and supplies depot, as well as a barracks. That, though, was somewhat of an anachronism by the time of the fort's completion, in comparison to other contemporary European military architecture. Additional buildings were completed in 1850."]}, {"page": "List of historic buildings in Quebec City", "response": ["| Citadelle of Quebec || 1820 and 1831 || Royal Engineer and Lieutenant Colonel Elias Walker Durnford || || || 100px ||"]}, {"page": "Durnford", "response": ["* Elias Walker Durnford, British engineer"]}, {"page": "John Dunscombe", "response": ["His daughter Caroline Augusta married James Crowdy, a member of the assembly.
