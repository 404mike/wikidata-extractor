Edwards was known in the field of entomology for his work on Diptera.\nEdwards worked in the British Museum (Natural History) which contains his collections made on his expeditions to Norway and Sweden (1923), Switzerland and Austria (1925), Argentina and Chile (1926/27), with Raymond Corbett Shannon, Corsica and USA (1928), the Baltic (1933), Kenya and Uganda (1934), with Ernest Gibbins, and the Pyrenees (1935).\nAmong the unusual insects that he described was the flightless marine midge Pontomyia. The mosquito genus Fredwardsius is named to honor his work establishing the generic and subgeneric framework which forms the basis for modern day systematics of the Culicidae of the world.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anopheles", "response": ["The genus has been subdivided into seven subgenera based primarily on the number and positions of specialized setae on the gonocoxites of the male genitalia.
