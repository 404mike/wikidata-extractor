But what he didn't recognise was what a good target man Vic was. We could play balls from defence into Vic Keeble and he would hold them in to himself or knock them off. He brought Jackie Dick into the play a lot more, got more out of Jackie Dick, and made more use of the wingers in terms of crosses\"."]}, {"page": "Ron Brett", "response": ["Brett started his career at Crystal Palace as a junior, signing professional terms in September 1954. He made his debut on 3 September 1955 in an away 1\u20131 draw against Millwall and went on to make 36 appearances for Palace, scoring 12 twelve goals. In June 1959, he moved to West Ham United, in a deal which saw Malcolm Pyke move the other way. Brett made 13 appearances in all competitions for West Ham between September 1959 and March 1962 before returning to Crystal Palace as part of the deal which saw Johnny Byrne move to \"The Hammers\". Five months after returning to Palace, Brett was killed when his car hit a lorry in Clerkenwell, London. The last match he played, just days before his death, was a reserve game between his two clubs, Crystal Palace and West Ham."]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 in English football", "response": ["* 20 February 2020: Malcolm Pyke, 81, West Ham United and Crystal Palace wing half."]}, {"page": "2020 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Malcolm Pyke, 81, English footballer (West Ham United, Crystal Palace, Dartford)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2020", "response": ["*Malcolm Pyke, 81, English footballer (West Ham United, Crystal Palace, Dartford).West Ham United profile"]}]}}
