He'll be going to a nice cottage in the country.\" His place was filled by a younger alternative medicine fan, Dr Fred Fonseca, played by Jimi Mistry. Leonard Fenton has since spoken about his frustration that Dr Legg did not get to practice enough, claiming that he \"was frustrated for years by Dr Legg's sporadic appearances\". In an interview in 2000, Fenton commented \"I told them I wasn't happy about going on once every two months. That's why it ended...\".
