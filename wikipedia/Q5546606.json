Their bizarre form induced a feeling of alienation, allowing people to realise the immense span of time passed since the era in which the ichthyosaur swam the oceans. Not all were convinced that ichthyosaurs had gone extinct: Reverend George Young found a skeleton in 1819 at Whitby; in his 1821 description, he expressed the hope that living specimens could still be found. Geologist Charles Lyell to the contrary, assumed that the Earth was eternal so that in the course of time the ichthyosaur might likely reappear, a possibility lampooned in a famous caricature by De la Beche."]}, {"page": "George Young", "response": ["George Young may refer to:", "* George Young (filmmaker), Australian stage manager and film director in the silent era", "* George Young (rock musician) (1946\u20132017), Australian musician, songwriter, and record producer", "* George Young (actor) (born 1980), British actor", "* George Young (saxophonist), member of Manhattan Jazz Quintet", "* Sir George Young, 4th Baronet (1872\u20131952), English author and Cambridge Union Society president", "* George Young (diplomat), (died c. 1615), Scottish diplomat and administrator", "* George Young, Lord Young (1819\u20131907), Scottish politician and judge", "* George Young, Baron Young of Cookham (born 1941), British Conservative Party politician", "* George Young (Australian politician) (1823\u20131869), businessman and politician in the colony of South Australia", "* George Young (surgeon) (1692\u20131757), Edinburgh surgeon, physician, philosopher and empiric", "* George Young (surgeon and botanist) (died 1803), British military surgeon and botanist", "* George Young (Presbyterian minister) (1777\u20131848), Scottish Presbyterian minister", "* George Young (Methodist minister) (1821\u20131910), Canadian Methodist minister", "* George Young (priest) (1852\u2013?), Dean of Adelaide, 1906\u20131933", "* George Young (cricketer) (1847-1935), New Zealand cricketer", "* George Young (baseball) (1890\u20131950), American professional baseball player", "* George Young (swimmer) (1909\u20131972), Canadian marathon swimmer", "* George Young (Scottish footballer) (1922\u20131997)", "* George Young (Welsh footballer)", "* George Young (American football executive) (1930\u20132001)", "* George Young (athlete) (born 1937), American track and field athlete, Olympic medalist", "* George Young (British athlete), British Olympic athlete", "* George Young (Australian rules footballer) (born 1949), Australian rules player and cricketer in the 1970s", "* George Young (American football) (1924\u20131969)", "* George Young (naval officer) (1732\u20131810), British Royal Navy admiral", "* George Young (architect) (1858\u20131933), Scottish architect", "* George Young (Neighbours), fictional character in the Australian soap opera Neighbours"]}, {"page": "Wade's Causeway", "response": ["Early records of the causeway's course to the north\u2014when its remains were apparently more readily visible than today\u2014differ considerably from one another: the early geologist and natural historian George Young, who wrote concerning the causeway in his History of Whitby, makes no clear mention of the route of the structure north of Wheeldale Moor; it is unmarked on the 1854 Ordnance Survey map of the area, and eighteenth-century historian Thomas Hinderwell's mention of it passing near Hunt House suggests a greatly differing route to that marked on 2012 Ordnance Survey mapping.
