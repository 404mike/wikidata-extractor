Spearheaded by the prolific strike partnership of Ian Wallace and Mick Ferguson, and ably abetted by the legendary winger Tommy Hutchison and attacking full backs Graham Oakey and Bobby MacDonald, the Sky Blues would enjoy a 7th-place finish in the 1977\u201378 season, narrowly missing out on European football. Yorath's Coventry side containing such notables as Alan Green, McDonald and Mick Coop are still fondly remembered even today by the Sky Blue faithful. A remarkable 5\u20134 win over Norwich City at Highfield Road, Christmas 1977, replete with bicycle kick by Ian Wallace and last gasp penalty save by Jim Blyth, lives long in Coventry folklore."]}, {"page": "Gordon Milne", "response": ["Milne joined Joe Mercer at Coventry City as team manager in June 1972, taking full control in 1974, upon Mercer's elevation to the Board. He was shortlisted for the England management role following the departure of Sir Alf Ramsey, but was overlooked in favour of Don Revie. He continued at Coventry until 1981, producing several exciting teams and securing the club's First Division status. The 1977\u201378 season saw Coventry's most exciting top-flight team. Gordon Milne settled on an attacking 4\u20132\u20134 formation.

Although in and out of the side he still made a significant contribution to what would be one of the most exciting campaigns in the club's 34-year top-flight history.

Beck was unable to hold down a regular place in the immensely successful QPR side of the mid 1970s, competing with England captain Gerry Francis and Scottish international Don Masson for the creative midfield role. In 1976, the year that QPR finished second to Liverpool in the First Division, he moved to Coventry City after playing 40 league games for Rangers, scoring once. The 1977\u201378 season saw John Beck playing in what was arguably Coventry's most exciting top-flight team of all time. Gordon Milne's side containing Tommy Hutchison, Mick Ferguson, Ian Wallace, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby MacDonald and Jim Blyth played scintillating attacking football that swept many teams aside, often by large margins of victory, although they failed to win any silverware or qualify for the UEFA Cup."]}, {"page": "Jim Blyth (footballer, born 1955)", "response": ["Blyth played for Coventry City from 1972\u20131982, making 151 league appearances. His ability led to a proposed \u00a3440,000 transfer to Manchester United in 1979 which failed to go through when he failed a medical on a suspect back. This move would have made him the world's most expensive goalkeeper. He earned two caps for the Scotland national football team, and was Scotland's second-choice goalkeeper at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The 1977\u201378 season saw Jim playing in Coventry's most exciting top-flight team. A side containing Mick Ferguson, Ian Wallace, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby McDonald and Tommy Hutchison played a brand of attacking football that swept many teams aside, often by large margins of victory. One of the most memorable games of that year came at Christmas when Norwich City visited Highfield Road. The game reached its zenith in the final minutes when Blyth saved John Ryan's penalty kick to help Coventry to a 5\u20134 victory. In the same season he was Man of the Match in the home game against Liverpool when he turned in a faultless performance in a 1-0 victory, making several saves in particular from David Fairclough and a penalty from Phil Neal."]}, {"page": "Ian Wallace (footballer, born 1956)", "response": ["Wallace was purchased for \u00a370,000 by the then Coventry manager Gordon Milne in 1976.

He also suffered a detached a retina whilst playing for Coventry at Norwich. Coventry finished 7th in the 1977-78 Football League, their second best ever placing after the team of 1969-70. Unlike in 1969-70 they missed out on a UEFA competition place. Wallace played that season alongside Ferguson, Tommy Hutchison, Terry Yorath, Graham Oakey, Bobby MacDonald and Jim Blyth.

During his first season with the Sky Blues, he played twice for the Welsh international side."]}, {"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["The 1977\u201378 season was a complete contrast, with a change in tactics by Gordon Milne, switching to an attacking 4\u20132\u20134 formation. The tactic meant City conceded more goals than previously, but with Yorath and Barry Powell as anchors in midfield, Hutchison and new signing Ray Graydon on the wings, and Wallace and Mick Ferguson as strikers, the attack were more than able to compensate. Coventry finished seventh, narrowly missing out on qualifying for Europe for a second time. A run of injuries led to a less successful campaign the following season, with a tenth-place finish. The club acquired new players Gary Gillespie and Steve Hunt for relatively low prices, both of whom would go on to enjoy success at the club. Despite their recent financial problems, Coventry attempted to make the first-ever \u00a31 million pound signing, of Trevor Francis, but the Birmingham striker elected to move to Nottingham Forest instead. A bid for Ipswich defender Kevin Beattie fell through over concerns about the player's fitness. The club's form suffered further in the 1979\u201380 season as they fell to fifteenth place in the league table, and exited the FA Cup in the fourth round to Third Division Blackburn. Phil Mead retired at the end of the season and Jimmy Hill, who had also acquired significant shareholdings in the club, was elevated to the chairmanship."]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Mick Ferguson", "|align=left| Mick Ferguson", "|align=left| Mick Ferguson"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Mick Ferguson", "|align=\"left\"|Mick Ferguson", "|align=\"left\"|Mick Ferguson"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Mick Ferguson||FW||||Newcastle upon Tyne||||0||0|| Brighton & Hove Albion||31 March 1986||Undisclosed", "|Mick Ferguson", "|align=\"left\"|Mick Ferguson", "|align=\"left\"|Mick Ferguson", "|Mick Ferguson"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=row|Mick Ferguson"]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["Thirty players appeared in at least one first-team game, and Noel Blake made most appearances, with 44 of the possible 49.
