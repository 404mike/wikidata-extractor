Ipswich won the match 2\u20130 with two goals from Ray Crawford. In an interview with The Times newspaper in July 2006, Swan said \"We lost the game fair and square, but I still don't know what I'd have done if we'd been winning. It would have been easy for me to give away a penalty or even score an own goal. Who knows?\". The betting ring was uncovered and publicised by a major article in The People newspaper. Swan was banned on Monday 13 April 1964 just as he was preparing to play against Tottenham that evening, his place in the team being taken by Vic Mobley. Swan received a four-month jail sentence in Lincoln jail and a life ban from football. It is believed that he might otherwise have been part of the England squad that won the 1966 World Cup; he was once told by England manager Alf Ramsey that he was \"top of the list\"."]}, {"page": "Mobley", "response": ["* Vic Mobley (born 1943), English former footballer"]}, {"page": "Gerry Young", "response": ["Young was part of the Sheffield Wednesday side which reached the FA Cup final in 1966 playing in all six matches.

Young failed to control a long downfield punt, Temple dispossessed him and ran on to beat Wednesday goalkeeper Ron Springett. Gerry Young stayed with Wednesday until he retired at the end of the 1970\u201371 season he played 310 league games (345 including cup games) scoring 20 goals.
