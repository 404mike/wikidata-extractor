However membership of the SSP does not seem to have increased the influence of the SWP and it has been claimed that the group has declined in numbers since joining. This claim being made by a former member of the SWP, Gregor Gall, in an article published in an attempt to change the course of the group written in 2004. Gall's figures were highly suspect and his motion did not even attract a single vote from the Scottish Platform of the SWP, Gall has since left the SWP and is now seen as a supporter of the leadership of the SSP.  In 2006, SWP members in Scotland left the Scottish Socialist Party and joined the new organisation, Solidarity (Scotland)."]}, {"page": "Gregor", "response": ["* Gregor Gall (born 1967), British academic"]}, {"page": "Convention of the Left", "response": ["*Prof. Gregor Gall (Labour movement academic)"]}, {"page": "HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan", "response": ["There have since been a few books written on the case: Downfall by Alan McCombes, Tommy Sheridan: From Hero to Zero?
