She was born in Christchurch, New Zealand and attended Fendalton Open Air School in Christchurch, Fairfield College in Hamilton and Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand.\nWright was the holder of the New Zealand 1000 meters record with a time of 2.38.54 set in the Berlin Olympic Stadium on 17 August 1979 until Angie Petty ran 2.37.28 in Tokyo in 2015. Although not recognised as a record at the time Alison's time was eventually ratified over 25 years later. In late 2011, Wright's time of 4:16.7 from January 1981 was also ratified as the official New Zealand women's indoor 1500 meter record though it remained the record for only a few months until it was beaten early in 2012 by Lucy van Dalen. Wright was also the 1500 meters national champion of New Zealand, Scotland and the United Kingdom (indoors).\nWright represented Oceania in the 1979 World Cup Finals in Montreal, Canada. She represented Scotland in the World Cross Country Championships in Madrid in 1981 and the United Kingdom in dual meets in 1981 and 1982. She achieved the 800 meter qualifying standard for the Moscow Olympic Games. Her selection was affected by the international boycott of those Games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alison Wright (disambiguation)", "response": ["Alison Wright (born 1976) is English actress.", "Alison Wright may also refer to:", "* Alison Wright (photojournalist) (born 1961), American photojournalist and writer", "* Alison Wright (cyclist) (born 1980), Australian cyclist", "* Alison Wright (athlete) (born 1949), New Zealand middle-distance runner"]}, {"page": "New Zealand at the 1978 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|align=left rowspan=2 |Alison Wright"]}, {"page": "David Wright (swimming coach)", "response": ["Prior to his career as a swimming coach, Wright coached track athletes including his wife Alison Wright, who represented New Zealand, Oceania and the United Kingdom over 800, 1500 and 3000 meters."]}]}}
