With the national press making Colchester's Cup progress headline news, Fenton welcomed the extra publicity. He watched Huddersfield play a number of times prior to the tie, declaring to the media that he had come up with a plan to beat them. The plan became known as \"the F\u2013plan\". Both teams changed colours for the game, with visiting Huddersfield in red, and Colchester in blue. The First Division side struggled to adapt to the cramped surroundings of Layer Road, and when Bob Allen's free kick was parried away by the goalkeeper, U's captain Bob Curry scored from the rebound.

Fieldus was appointed Secretary-Manager and attended the first post-War Southern League meeting in the summer of 1945.

Ted Fenton was appointed manager for the 1946\u201347 season, who had turned out for Colchester Town in the early 1930s whilst a teenager. Fenton had excellent contacts and wasted no time in assembling his team from an array of professionals looking for a new start after the long War years.

Wrexham, of the Third Division North were duly dispatched by a Bob Curry goal with both sides missing penalties.
