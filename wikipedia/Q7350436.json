After a move to London in 1836, he became prominent in the early years of the Colony of South Australia, emigrating after being appointed to a civil service position there in 1840. He was Colonial Treasurer and Registrar-General from 1852 to 1857 and then the third Premier of South Australia for a single month in September 1857.\nTorrens is chiefly remembered as the originator of the Torrens title, a new system of land registration that subsequently spread to the other Australian colonies and is used in Australia and in many other countries throughout the world today. He secured its implementation in South Australia in 1858, and subsequently advocated for its adoption in other jurisdictions. Returning to England in 1865, he served in the British House of Commons from 1868 to 1874.\nHe was son of the political economist Robert Torrens, who was chairman of the London-based South Australian Colonisation Commission involved in setting up and encouraging emigration to the new colony.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 31", "response": ["*1884 \u2013 Robert Torrens, Irish-Australian politician, 3rd Premier of South Australia (b. 1814)"]}, {"page": "May 31", "response": ["*1812 \u2013 Robert Torrens, Irish-Australian politician, 3rd Premier of South Australia (d. 1884)Croucher, Rosalind F.

The Torrens title system is an alternative way of proving ownership. First introduced in South Australia in 1858 by Sir Robert Torrens and adopted later by the other Australian states and other countries, ownership under Torrens title is proven by possession of a certificate of title and the corresponding entry in the property register. This system removes risks associated with unregistered deeds and fraudulent or otherwise incorrect transactions. It is much easier and cheaper to administer, lowering transaction costs. Some Australian properties are still conveyed using a chain of title deeds \u2013 usually properties that have been owned by the same family since the nineteenth century \u2013 and these are often referred to as 'Old System' deeds."]}, {"page": "River Torrens", "response": ["At its 1836 exploration by William Light, an inland bend was chosen as the site of the Adelaide city centre and North Adelaide.
