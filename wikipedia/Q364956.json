In 1858, he was hired as full professor at the University of Ghent, then in 1867 he was called to Bonn, where he remained for the rest of his career. Basing his ideas on those of predecessors such as Williamson, Charles Gerhardt, Edward Frankland, William Odling, Auguste Laurent, Charles-Adolphe Wurtz and others, Kekul\u00e9 was the principal formulator of the theory of chemical structure (1857\u201358). This theory proceeds from the idea of atomic valence, especially the tetravalence of carbon (which Kekul\u00e9 announced late in 1857) and the ability of carbon atoms to link to each other (announced in a paper published in May 1858), to the determination of the bonding order of all of the atoms in a molecule. Archibald Scott Couper independently arrived at the idea of self-linking of carbon atoms (his paper appeared in June 1858), and provided the first molecular formulas where lines symbolize bonds connecting the atoms. For organic chemists, the theory of structure provided dramatic new clarity of understanding, and a reliable guide to both analytic and especially synthetic work. As a consequence, the field of organic chemistry developed explosively from this point. Among those who were most active in pursuing early structural investigations were, in addition to Kekul\u00e9 and Couper, Frankland, Wurtz, Alexander Crum Brown, Emil Erlenmeyer, and Alexander Butlerov."]}, {"page": "List of chemists", "response": ["*Alexander Crum Brown (1838\u20131922), Scottish organic chemist"]}, {"page": "Dean Cemetery", "response": ["* Alexander Crum Brown (1838\u20131922) chemist"]}, {"page": "Kerogen", "response": ["Kerogen is solid, insoluble organic matter in sedimentary rocks.

Petroleum and natural gas form from kerogen. Kerogen may be classified by its origin: lacustrine (e.g., algal), marine (e.g., planktonic), and terrestrial (e.g., pollen and spores).

He was open to the idea of divalent carbon, which Kekul\u00e9 was not.  He provided many more resolved formulas in his paper than Kekul\u00e9 had, and in two cases even suggested (hetero)cyclical formulas, which could have influenced Kekul\u00e9 in his later suggestion of the benzene ring.  Couper adopted the atomic weight of oxygen as 8 rather than 16, so there are twice as many oxygen atoms in Couper's formulas as in those of Kekul\u00e9.  Finally, Couper used dotted lines or dashes between the atoms in his formulas, approximating the appearance of later formula styles.

Ray's essay was widely publicised in Britain, with The Scotsman observing \"It contains information in reference to India which will not be found elsewhere, and is deserving of the utmost notice.\" A copy of the paper was read by the distinguished orator and Liberal Member of Parliament for Birmingham John Bright; Bright's sympathetic reply to Ray was published in leading newspapers across Britain under the title \"John Bright's Letter to an Indian Student.\" The following year, Ray published his paper as a booklet entitled \"Essay on India,\" which likewise earned its author wide attention in British political circles."]}, {"page": "Keith Medal", "response": ["*1873\u201375: Alexander Crum Brown, on the Sense of Rotation, and on the Anatomical Relations of the Semicircular Canals of the Internal Ear"]}, {"page": "David Orme Masson", "response": ["Masson was educated at Oliphant's School in Edinburgh (1865\u201368), the Edinburgh Academy and then the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MA in 1877.
