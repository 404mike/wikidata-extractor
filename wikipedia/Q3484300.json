He was a fixture in the team for the next two years, but was dropped in favour of Simon Hodgkinson in the second half of 1989, on the grounds of Hodgkinson's more consistent kicking both from hand and from place-kicks, and did not play for the next couple of years, thus missing out on the Five Nations Grand Slam of 1991 (and on the near-miss in 1990). Recalled for the summer tour and the World Cup later that autumn - on the grounds that he was more adventurous going forward and gave England greater options in the back line, after criticism of their forward-heavy tactics in the 1991 Grand Slam - he was in the England team that reached the 1991 World Cup Final, kicking his country\u2019s only points as they lost to Australia 12-6. Webb also was part of the team that won England's second successive Five Nations championship Grand Slam in 1992: including perhaps his finest performance, scoring two tries (the first after less than a minute) in the 38-9 victory over Ireland in addition to kicking four conversions and two penalties. In addition to the consistency of his much-improved kicking throughout the tournament, he added another try against France in the next match as well."]}, {"page": "Hodgkinson", "response": ["*Simon Hodgkinson, English rugby player"]}, {"page": "1989 England rugby union tour of Romania", "response": ["Simon Hodgkinson (Nottingham)"]}, {"page": "1990 England rugby union tour of Argentina", "response": ["|align=left |Simon Hodgkinson (Nottingham RFC - 6 caps - Full Back)|| 4|| 1|| 2|| 16|| || 56"]}, {"page": "List of Moseley R.F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Simon Hodgkinson", "|Simon Hodgkinson"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|1134||Simon Hodgkinson||fullback ||1989-05-13||v Romania at Bucharest"]}, {"page": "Stamford School", "response": ["* Simon Hodgkinson, England international rugby"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 EIHL season", "response": ["| Cardiff Devils || Cardiff Arena || Simon Hodgkinson || 2003 || Gerad Adams || Stuart MacRae|| Kenton Smith || Phil Hill"]}, {"page": "1991 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Simon Hodgkinson"]}, {"page": "1990 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Simon Hodgkinson"]}, {"page": "1990 Argentina rugby union tour of British Isles", "response": ["|align=right|Simon Hodgkinson||align=right|FB||align=center|15||FB||Alejandro Scolni", " BARBARIAN F.C.: Simon Hodgkinson; Ieuan Evans, Craig Innes, Mark Ring, Keith Crossan; Craig Chalmers, Robert Jones (capt.); Gareth Rees, Phil Davies, Richard Webster; Chris Gray, Ian Jones; P.Knight, T.Kingston, L.Hullena.

He played against Wales (18 January), France (28 January) and was selected to play against Ireland on 8 February (at Richmond) but missed the game having been injured in a club match a few days before.  He returned to the England team for the final match against Scotland (21 March).  Lambert did not play for England during either the 1909 or 1910 international seasons, but in 1911 he was recalled and played three matches.  In the game against Wales (21 January) he scored a single try.  In the next game, however, against France (28 January), Lambert scored an unprecedented 22 points, a record for England that stood until 1990 when Simon Hodgkinson scored 23 points against . Yet Lambert's tally of two tries, five conversions and two penalties that earned him 22 points in 1911, would have scored 24 points in 1990 and 26 points in 1991. The game against France was also noteworthy for being England's first at its new home ground of Twickenham., Four of the England backline that day were Harlequins players: John Birkett, who captained England, Adrian Stoop and his brother Frank, as well as Douglas Lambert."]}]}}
