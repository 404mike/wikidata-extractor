He also built a row of labourer's cottages which had two acres attached to each to encourage self-sufficiency. Irving majored in developing what was then known as Ballylig Lime Works, building quays and a railway, and expanding the production. In 1834 130,000 barrels of lime were exported at 10d per barrel, amounting to over \u00a35400. 300 tons of limestone was exported, valued at \u00a322 and 624 tons of flint amounting to a value of \u00a3140. Ships traded with County Down, the Clyde, Liverpool, Kintyre and other areas. Flints from Magheramorne quarries were used in the Staffordshire Potteries. Irving died in London in November 1845. His agent at Magheramorne was Thomas Maxwell, who lived at Ballylig House.\nThe lime works which were established by Irving became the British Portland Cement Company Plant, and subsequently Blue Circle. The cement plant closed at Magheramorne some years ago, but there are plans to develop major adventure park activities at the quarry workings at Magheramorne.\nIrving was a Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Bramber, a rotten borough in Sussex, England, 1806-1832 and following its abolition in 1832, for Antrim, 1837-1845", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|John Irving"]}, {"page": "Bramber (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"5\"| John Irving"]}, {"page": "John Irving (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Irving (born 1942) is an American novelist and Academy Award-winning screenwriter.", "John Irving may also refer to:", "*John Irving (basketball) (1953\u20132015), American college basketball player in the 1970s", "*John Irving (footballer, born 1867) (1867\u20131942), Lincoln City footballer in the 1890s", "*John Irving (footballer, born 1988), English footballer in the 21st century ", "*John Irving (MP) (1766\u20131845), MP for Antrim and Bramber", "*John Irving (sailor) (1839\u2013?), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Irving (steamship captain) (1854\u20131936), Canadian steamship captain and politician in British Columbia"]}, {"page": "John Irving MP", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Irving (MP)"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1832\u20131847)", "response": ["|John Irving"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Bramber(two members)||John Irving||"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Bramber(two members)||John Irving||"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1826 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Bramber(two members)||John Irving||"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Irving||"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1806 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Irving "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1807 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Irving "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1812 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Irving "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1818 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Irving "]}]}}
