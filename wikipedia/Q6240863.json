He also built a row of labourer's cottages which had two acres attached to each to encourage self-sufficiency. Irving majored in developing what was then known as Ballylig Lime Works, building quays and a railway, and expanding the production. In 1834 130,000 barrels of lime were exported at 10d per barrel, amounting to over \u00a35400. 300 tons of limestone was exported, valued at \u00a322 and 624 tons of flint amounting to a value of \u00a3140. Ships traded with County Down, the Clyde, Liverpool, Kintyre and other areas. Flints from Magheramorne quarries were used in the Staffordshire Potteries. Irving died in London in November 1845. His agent at Magheramorne was Thomas Maxwell, who lived at Ballylig House.\nThe lime works which were established by Irving became the British Portland Cement Company Plant, and subsequently Blue Circle. The cement plant closed at Magheramorne some years ago, but there are plans to develop major adventure park activities at the quarry workings at Magheramorne.\nIrving was a Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Bramber, a rotten borough in Sussex, England, 1806-1832 and following its abolition in 1832, for Antrim, 1837-1845", "link_mentions": {}}}
