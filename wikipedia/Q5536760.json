He was educated at Repton School but did not play for the school side as he left in 1873 aged 16. He made several successful appearances for the Derbyshire Friars cricket club and played miscellaneous games for Derbyshire in the 1879 season against Harrow Wanderers and the Derbyshire Colts. He made his first-class debut for Derbyshire in the 1880 season  against a team of touring Australians, in which he scored a duck in his first innings but became the top scorer for the team in the second, making 24 before he was run out. Barrington played his debut County match three days later against Lancashire, in which he made 24 again and 20. He appeared later in the season for Gentlemen of Derbyshire during a Canadian tour of England, in a match which the Derbyshire team won by an innings and 229 runs. Barrington was struggling for consistent form in the upper order but excelled when partnered by specialist bowlers rather than specialist batsmen. The 1881 season started less promisingly, though he was once again given a chance in the upper order. Barrington only played one County match between the end of 1881 and the beginning of 1884, though when he returned for the team, in the first game of the 1884 season, his first game, against Sussex, included his first and only half-century of his career, once again batting in the opening order. He returned for Derbyshire during the 1887 season and in his last game failed to score.\nBarrington was a right-handed batsman and played 48 innings in 25 first-class matches with an average of 9.68 and a top score of 50. He was a round-arm slow bowler and took 1 first-class wicket for 27 runs.Barrington died at the age of 84 in Kirk Langley where he is remembered by the G B Barrington Playing Fields.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Smith (Derbyshire cricketer)", "response": ["In the 1877 season Smith's batting average was up to the twenties and his Derbyshire side won five matches to three losses. In the 1878 season Smith was top scorer for Derbyshire with 390 runs and played again for a losing North side against South Derbyshire lost more of their matches in this season. The 1879 season was also less successful for the club and Smith's average fell to single figures. In the 1880 Derbyshire faced the touring Australian, captained by Harry Boyle. The highly experienced Australian team, consisting entirely of contemporary Test players, won with an innings to spare. Also in 1880 Smith opened for the Gentlemen against the Players, along with George Barrington, just three weeks after an innings victory over a Canadian representative team, which included Thomas Phillips and Walter Gilbert. Smith carried on captaining the Derbyshire team in the 1881, 1882 and 1883 seasons playing more matches but seeing fewer wins. He handed over captaincy to Ludford Docker for the 1884 season in which he played his last six matches."]}, {"page": "Kirk Langley", "response": ["* George Barrington, cricketer died here."]}, {"page": "George Barrington (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Barrington (1755\u20131804) was an Irish pickpocket and later a policeman.", "George Barrington may also refer to:", "*George Barrington (cricketer) (1857\u20131942), English cricketer", "*George Barrington, 7th Viscount Barrington (1824\u20131886), British Conservative politician", "*George Barrington (Royal Navy officer) (1794\u20131835), British naval officer and politician"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1880", "response": ["Robert Smith was in his fifth year as captain.
