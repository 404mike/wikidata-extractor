He has also appeared on other television shows such as Celebrity MasterChef and The Jump. He is the founder and CEO of CleanCo, a low- and no-alcohol drinks company.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reality television", "response": ["Reality television has the potential to turn its participants into national celebrities, at least for a short period. This is most notable in talent-search programs such as Idol and The X Factor, which have spawned music stars in many of the countries in which they have aired. Many other shows, however, have made at least temporary celebrities out of their participants; some participants have then been able to parlay this fame into media and merchandising careers. Participants of non-talent-search programs who have had subsequent acting careers include Lilian Afegbai, Jacinda Barrett, Jamie Chung, Stephen Colletti, David Giuntoli, Vishal Karwal, NeNe Leakes and Angela Trimbur; though Barrett and Trimbur were already aspiring actresses when they appeared on reality television. Reality TV participants who have become television hosts and personalities include Nabilla Benattia, Rachel Campos-Duffy, Kristin Cavallari, Colby Donaldson, Raffaella Fico, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Katie Hopkins, Rebecca Jarvis, Jodie Marsh, Heidi Montag, Tiffany Pollard and Whitney Port; some of them have had acting careers as well. Reality TV participants who have become television personalities as well as successful entrepreneurs include Gemma Collins, Lauren Conrad, Jade Goody, Bethenny Frankel and Spencer Matthews. Several cast members of MTV's Jersey Shore have had lucrative endorsement deals, and in some cases their own product lines. Wrestlers Mike \"The Miz\" Mizanin and David Otunga got their start on non-athletic reality shows."]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 20th century", "response": ["*Spencer Matthews (born 1988), reality television personality "]}, {"page": "Howth", "response": ["* Vogue Williams formerly of Ceannchor Road, Baily; currently owns an apartment in St. Lawrences with her husband Spencer Matthews"]}, {"page": "John Partridge (actor)", "response": ["In May 2018 it was announced that he would be appearing on Celebrity Masterchef later that year.
