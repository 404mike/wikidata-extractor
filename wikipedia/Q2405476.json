During this time, he made the acquaintance of local furniture restorer, country blues enthusiast and part-time performer Steve Phillips, one year his senior, from whose record collection and guitar style Knopfler acquired a good knowledge of early blues artists and their styles; the two subsequently formed a duo called \"The Duolian String Pickers\", which performed in local folk and acoustic blues venues. Two years later, he decided to further his education, and later graduated with a degree in English at the University of Leeds.   In April 1970, while living in Leeds, Knopfler recorded a demo disk of an original song he had written, \"Summer's Coming My Way\". The recording included Knopfler (guitar and vocals), Steve Phillips (second guitar), Dave Johnson (bass), and Paul Granger (percussion). Johnson, Granger, and vocalist Mick Dewhirst played with Knopfler in a band called Silverheels; Phillips was later to rejoin Knopfler in the short lived side exercise from Dire Straits, The Notting Hillbillies.", "Dire Straits' first demos were recorded in three sessions in 1977, with David Knopfler as rhythm guitarist, John Illsley as bass guitarist, and Pick Withers as drummer. On 27 July 1977 they recorded the demo tapes of five songs: \"Wild West End,\" \"Sultans of Swing,\" \"Down to the Waterline,\" \"Sacred Loving\" (a David Knopfler song), and \"Water of Love.\" They later recorded \"Southbound Again,\" \"In the Gallery,\" and \"Six Blade Knife\" for BBC Radio London\u2014and, finally, on 9 November, made demo tapes of \"Setting Me Up,\" \"Eastbound Train,\" and \"Real Girl.\" Many of these songs reflect Knopfler's experiences in Newcastle, Leeds, and London, and were featured on their first album, the eponymous Dire Straits, which was released in the following year: \"Down to the Waterline\" recalled images of life in Newcastle; \"In The Gallery\" is a tribute to a Leeds sculptor and artist named Harry Phillips (father of Steve Phillips); and \"Lions,\" \"Wild West End,\" and \"Eastbound Train\" were all drawn from Knopfler's early days in the capital.", "In 1989, Knopfler formed the Notting Hillbillies, a band at the other end of the commercial spectrum.

For both the album and the tour Paul Franklin was added to the line-up on pedal steel.
