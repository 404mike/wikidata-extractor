She does not have an ex-boyfriend, but writer Russell T Davies has stated that she is not a lesbian, as had been rumoured in some quarters. An article in The Times speculated that, since Agyeman has martial arts skills, she may have \"a more physical approach\" to the role. As with her predecessor Rose, Martha is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia presumes this is because characters from the capital of the country are \"therefore relatable to all British people\" because they are seen as \"neutral\"."]}, {"page": "Walter (1982 film)", "response": ["* Trevor Laird as Errol (Nurse)"]}, {"page": "Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)", "response": ["\"Smith and Jones\" is the first episode of the third series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who.
