It is a long solid book, purposely digressive, and there is a good deal of hard slogging before we get to the main theme. The title promises more than the performance. There is only one nun and no soldiers at all.\" He added, \"The married life of Gertrude and Guy is presented as so insufferably mature, cultivated, public-spirited and smug that the reader's first instinct is to close the book before it has begun and forswear the society of mature, cultivated, public-spirited persons for the rest of time.\" Hough concluded, \"But Iris Murdoch's writing has the power to engage the reader in its conflicts, even without the pleasures of recognition or sympathy; and though they are slow in developing, the conflicts are not absent.

In 1955, R. W. Ketton-Cremer argued, \"At the close of his greatest poem Gray was led to describe, simply and movingly, what sort of man he believed himself to be, how he had fared in his passage through the world, and what he hoped for from eternity.\" Regarding the status of the poem, Graham Hough in 1953 explained, \"no one has ever doubted, but many have been hard put to it to explain in what its greatness consists. It is easy to point out that its thought is commonplace, that its diction and imagery are correct, noble but unoriginal, and to wonder where the immediately recognizable greatness has slipped in.\" Following in 1963, Martin Day argued that the poem was \"perhaps the most frequently quoted short poem in English.\" Frank Brady, in 1965, declared, \"Few English poems have been so universally admired as Gray's Elegy, and few interpreted in such widely divergent ways.\" Patricia Spacks, in 1967, focused on the psychological questions in the poem and claimed that \"For these implicit questions the final epitaph provides no adequate answer; perhaps this is one reason why it seems not entirely a satisfactory conclusion to the poem.\" She continued by praising the poem: \"Gray's power as a poet derives largely from his ability to convey the inevitability and inexorability of conflict, conflict by its nature unresolvable.\" In 1968, Herbert Starr pointed out that the poem was \"frequently referred to, with some truth, as the best known poem in the English language.\""]}, {"page": "Encounter (magazine)", "response": ["Encounter provoked controversy, with some British commentators arguing the journal took an excessively deferential stand towards United States foreign policy.Saunders, Frances Stonor.

The Irish-born George Moore was provoked into becoming a writer by his seven years at Oscott, which he called \"a vile hole, a den of priests\", turning to Byron and Shelley and noting that \"it pleased me to read 'Queen Mab' and 'Cain' amid the priests and ignorance of a hateful Roman Catholic college\". His early novels \u2013 particularly his 1885 work A Mummer's Wife, which dealt with alcoholism and the seedy underside of theatrical life \u2013 \"opened up new possibilities for the novel in English\", being the first to break away from the literary conventions of the Victorian style under the influence of the naturalism of \u00c9mile Zola. Moore constantly developed the form of his literary self-expression, with his later novels having a more fragmented, tapestry-like structure. He was a pivotal figure in the transition from Victorian to modern fiction, and a particular influence on James Joyce: the critic Graham Hough wrote that \"neither the title nor the content of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man would have been quite the same in 1916 if it had not been for the prior existence of George Moore's Confessions of a Young Man in 1886.\" \"The Dead\", the final story of Joyce's Dubliners, was directly inspired by Moore's 1891 novel Vain Fortune. The eccentric novelist and artist Frederick Rolfe studied at Oscott from 1887, but left after it was decided he was an unsuitable candidate for the priesthood. Despite his open homosexuality he strongly felt himself to have a vocation for the priesthood throughout his lifetime. His most famous work was the decadent semi-autobiographical wish-fulfilment novel Hadrian the Seventh, published under his self-styled title Baron Corvo, in which he imagined himself as the Pope, but he also wrote short stories, poetry and essays. Wilfrid Scawen Blunt was inspired to become poet by the metaphysical teachings of Oscott's professor of philosophy during the 1850s, but embarked upon a succession of affairs during his subsequent career as a diplomat, becoming a self-confessed hedonist. He is best known for his erotic verse, and for his anti-imperialist opposition to British policy in Ireland, Egypt, Sudan and India. In 1914 a group of poets including W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, and Richard Aldington entertained Blunt to a lunch of roast peacock, paying tribute to him as the first poet to relate poetry to real life. Pound wrote of Blunt's \"unconquered flame\", though Yeats was more ambivalent, confiding in T. Sturge Moore that \"only a small part of his work is good but that is exceedingly fine\"."]}, {"page": "Hough (surname)", "response": ["* Graham Hough (1908\u20131990), English literary critic and poet"]}, {"page": "The Divine and the Decay", "response": ["The book was heavily attacked by critics upon the publication.

In 1955, with almost 10,000 letters transcribed, House died unexpectedly.  His widow Madeline House took over the project in collaboration with the critic Graham Hough, though Graham Storey soon took over Hough's role.  The first volume of the Pilgrim Trust Edition, as it was named, was eventually published by Oxford University Press under their Clarendon Press imprint in 1965, and 11 more volumes appeared periodically, the last one in 2002.  The editorial team changed over the years, with Madeline House, Graham Storey, Kathleen Tillotson, K. J. Fielding, Nina Burgis and Angus Easson all being named as editor at various points.  The British Academy took over the financing of the project, and from 1995 it was renamed the British Academy \u2013 Pilgrim Trust Edition.  An electronic version of the edition has been published by InteLex Past Masters.  The Pilgrim Edition includes some 14,000 letters addressed to 2,500 known correspondents and to more than 200 unnamed and unidentifiable ones.  Not all of the originals of these letters can be found; some are printed from short extracts in sale catalogues and similar sources, and some are only known from mentions of their existence in other letters.  Dickens's biographer Claire Tomalin reported that \"Each volume of this edition wins acclaim as it appears, and it is right that it should do so\"; one such critic thought that \"it brings Dickens so close you can almost smell the cigar smoke\".  Dissenting voices have been few, and though Joel J.
