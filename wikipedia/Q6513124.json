He played one game for West Ham in the Premier League, as a substitute during the latter stages of the 1996\u201397 season. He was sent out on loan to Kingstonian in 1998, and was released on his return to his parent club in 1999. He had brief spells with Trelleborg in Sweden and with Exeter City, before rejoining Kingstonian on a permanent basis in 2000. He left the club in November 2000, and played for Hayes and Stevenage during the final months of the 2000\u201301 season.\nAhead of the 2001\u201302 season, Boylan joined Canvey Island, where he played 210 games and scored 176 goals for the club during a five-year spell. When Canvey resigned from the Conference in 2006, he joined Grays Athletic on a one-year contract, but was later loaned to Chelmsford City after struggling for first-team appearances at Grays. Boylan joined Cambridge United on a free transfer shortly before the 2007\u201308 season, as Cambridge narrowly missed out on promotion to the Football League in May 2008. He joined Stevenage for an undisclosed fee in June 2008, scoring in the 2009 FA Trophy Final victory against York City at Wembley Stadium in May 2009. Boylan was also part of the Stevenage team that won promotion to the Football League the following season.\nBoylan left Stevenage in January 2011 and subsequently re-joined Chelmsford City in March of the same year. After just five appearances for Chelmsford, Boylan joined Thurrock for the rest of the 2010\u201311 season. He spent a further season at Thurrock, before leaving the club following their relegation. In July 2012, Boylan joined AFC Sudbury. Midway through the 2012\u201313 season, Boylan signed for divisional rivals Maldon & Tiptree, which would be his last club before retiring from playing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Ham United F.C.
