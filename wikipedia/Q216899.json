The album reached number two in the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

A few examples like Daft Punk's \"One More Time\" and Kylie Minogue's \"Love at First Sight\" and \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" became club favorites and commercial successes. Several nu-disco songs were crossovers with funky house, such as Spiller's \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" and Modjo's \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\", both songs sampling older disco songs and both reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart in 2000. Robbie Williams' disco single \"Rock DJ\" was the UK's fourth best-selling single the same year. Jamiroquai\u00b4s song \"Little L\" and \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor were hits on 2001 too. Rock band Manic Street Preachers released a disco song, \"Miss Europa Disco Dancer\", in 2001. The song's disco influence, which appears on Know Your Enemy, was described as being \"much-discussed\". In 2005, Madonna immersed herself in the disco music of the 1970s, and released her album Confessions on a Dance Floor to rave reviews. In addition to that, her song \"Hung Up\" became a major top-10 song and club staple, and sampled ABBA's 1979 song \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\". In addition to her disco-influenced attire to award shows and interviews, her Confessions Tour also incorporated various elements of the 1970s, such as disco balls, a mirrored stage design, and the roller derby. In 2006, Jessica Simpson released her album A Public Affair inspired on disco and 1980s Music. The first single of the album A Public Affair was reviewed as a disco-dancing competition influenced by Madonna\u00b4s early works.
