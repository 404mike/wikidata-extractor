The performance earned him his second Grammy Award. The second single was \"Coconut\", a novelty calypso number featuring four characters (the narrator, the brother, the sister, and the doctor) all sung (at Perry's suggestion) in different voices by Nilsson. The song is best remembered for its chorus lyric (\"Put de lime in de coconut, and drink 'em both up\"). Also notable is that the entire song is played using one chord, C7.

The US manager of Apple Records, Ken Mansfield, ordered 400,000 copies of the single\u2014considered to be a bold move at the time in the music business\u2014and pushed for automatic airplay and reviews from newspapers, which he secured. Nevertheless, Mansfield remembered the problems: \"We had a great group. We had a great record. We were missing just one thing ... the ability to go out and pick up people, and convince them to put their money on the counter.\" A second Tom Evans composition, \"Storm in a Teacup\", was included on an Apple EP promoting Wall's Ice Cream, along with songs by Apple artists such as James Taylor, Mary Hopkin, and Jackie Lomax. The chart success of \"Maybe Tomorrow\" in Europe and Japan led to a follow-up single release in those markets in July 1969: Griffiths's \"Dear Angie\", also produced by Visconti. An LP containing both singles and titled Maybe Tomorrow was released only in Italy, Germany, and Japan.

Later that night he met Tom Evans and they went to The White Hart Pub in Surrey together, where Ham drank ten whiskies. Evans drove him home at three o'clock on the morning of 24 April 1975. Ham hanged himself in his garage studio in Woking later that morning. His suicide note\u2014addressed to his girlfriend, Anne Herriot, and her son, Blair\u2014blamed Polley for much of his despair and inability to cope with his disappointments in life. The note read: \"Anne, I love you. Blair, I love you. I will not be allowed to love and trust everybody. This is better. Pete. P.S. Stan Polley is a soulless bastard. I will take him with me\".
