Roberts also questioned whether she had achieved anything different from other members of the royal family and added that Diana was neither \"a saint\" nor \"a revolutionary\" figure, but \"may have encouraged some people\" to tackle issues such as landmines, AIDS and leprosy. While analysing the impact of Diana's death and her extraordinary popularity from a gendered point of view, British historian Ludmilla Jordanova said: \"To be an ideal, to be living for and on behalf of others is a terrible burden; it makes impossible, irreconcilable emotional demands \u2013 no human being can survive the complex forces that impact upon charismatic women.\" Jordanova also observed that \"Diana herself was not anti-establishment\" and that is \"Better to remember her by trying to decipher how emotions overshadow analysis and why women are the safeguards of humanitarian feelings.\" Author Anne Applebaum believed that Diana has not had any impact on public opinions posthumously; an idea supported by Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian who also wrote in his article that Diana's memory and influence started to fade away in the years after her death, while Peter Conrad, another Guardian contributor, argued that even in \"a decade after her death, she is still not silent\", and Allan Massie of The Telegraph described Diana as \"the celebrity of celebrities\" whose sentiments \"continue to shape our society\". Writing for The Guardian, Monica Ali described Diana as \"a one-off, fascinating and flawed. Her legacy might be mixed, but it's not insubstantial. Her life was brief, but she left her mark\"."]}, {"page": "Oxford High School, England", "response": ["* Ludmilla Jordanova, Professor of Modern History at the King's College London"]}, {"page": "Simon Critchley", "response": ["After studying for remedial 'O' and 'A' level exams at a community college while doing other odd jobs, Critchley went to university aged 22.
