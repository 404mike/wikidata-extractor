The first arrival was goalkeeper Billy Light, who joined from Harland and Wolff on amateur terms and did not turn professional until more than a year later. Outside-right Fred Dunmore was signed for the reserve team from Derby County in June, when Accrington Stanley goalkeeper Bob Foster was also signed. Winger Jimmy Harris joined from West Ham United in July, followed by centre-forward Norman Cole from Newport (Isle of Wight) in August. After the season had started, inside-left Tom Ruddy was signed from Chesterfield. Also in September, Willie Haines was sold to Weymouth, George Harkus joined Southport as reserve player-coach, and Sid Grover signed for Bournemouth Gasworks Athletic. Half-back Cyril King signed from Plymouth United on amateur terms in November. In February, with the club still suffering financial problems, Fulham bought outside-left Johnny Arnold and left-back Michael Keeping for a combined fee of \u00a35,100.

In October, outside-right Fred Dunmore was sold to Blyth Spartans, and the following month inside-right Joe Cummins and amateur goalkeeper Eugene Bernard were signed. The most notable transfer of the season, however, took place late in the campaign when Ted Drake was sold to First Division title challengers Arsenal. Drake had previously rejected an approach from the Gunners, but moved to the club after a second offer in March 1934, breaking Southampton's transfer record with his fee of \u00a36,000. At the time, Drake was the top scorer in the Second Division with 22 goals; in the ten games he played for Arsenal before the end of the season, he scored seven league goals to help them win the championship.", "!scope=\"row\"|Fred Dunmore"]}]}}
