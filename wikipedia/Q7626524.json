Prior to this career, Fell served in the Parachute Regiment. He has appeared on British television many times, with his earliest role being in the LWT comedy series Hark at Barker, in which he plays the driver of a car that crashes when he's distracted by Ronnie Barker carrying a mannequin. In 1971, he appeared as an uncredited extra in the Doctor Who serial Terror of the Autons, and his last role came in 1998, as a stuntman in Duck Patrol.He worked in over twenty Doctor Who stories in all, from 1971 to 1983, most often as a stuntman or actor, though he served once as a fight arranger in 1981. He was Dennis Moore on horseback in Monty Pythons Flying Circus, literally sitting in for John Cleese.\nHis small size made him ideal for a number of roles. He was able to get inside a number of small, cramped costumes and even doubled for Katy Manning and Louise Jameson (wearing their costumes on both occasions!). His large range of varied skills also earned him considerable praise. In several DVD commentaries, a number of people have remarked that \"he could do anything\" from juggling, fire-breathing, acrobatics, stilt-walking and ride a motorcycle. As a relatively young newcomer to stunt work, he was eager to prove himself. One example was in The Claws of Axos, where he is shot and then flipped backwards on a wire rig.\nHe became well known within the series for a number of instances, one being a stunt in which he performed an (unpaid) back flip when he \"died\" in The Sea Devils. He also had to stand in for Kevin Lindsay in The Sontaran Experiment when Lindsay's heart condition made it too difficult for him to complete his lengthy fight scene. Another notable instance was in The Invasion of Time, in which he improvised a jump (in full costume) and almost fell down as he landed on a folding chair. He then fell over a chair thrown at him to only narrowly stop himself from rolling into location's swimming pool. The whole sequence ended up being used in the final version. Stuart Fell explained, in a 2004 documentary, that he was encouraged to improvise and it was felt that these trips made the scenes more interesting.\nHe played minor parts in three episodes of Blake's 7.\nHe appeared in television adaptations of Hamlet, The Mayor of Casterbridge and The Old Curiosity Shop. He has appeared in The Empire Strikes Back, the first two Superman films, three James Bond films, Aliens and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Most of his film work was as a stunt man.\nFell is currently a professional juggler, is a member of The Magic Circle, and appeared on the Antiques Roadshow as an unnamed member of the public demonstrating his collection of yo-yos, diablos and other conjuring toys. \nHe appeared in the Time Quest 2009 Doctor Who convention, where he took part in signings, panels and photo shoots with attendees. He also dressed as a jester and attracted very large queues. His panel was the most visited of the day just behind Tom Baker.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| The Empire Strikes Back (Special Edition) || 20th Century Fox / Lucasfilm || Irvin Kershner (director); Leigh Brackett, Lawrence Kasdan (screenplay); Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, Frank Oz, Alec Guinness, Jeremy Bulloch, John Hollis,  Jack Purvis, Clive Revill, Kenneth Colley, Julian Glover, Michael Sheard, Michael Culver, Bruce Boa, Christopher Malcolm, Denis Lawson, Richard Oldfield, John Morton, Ian Liston, John Ratzenberger, Brigitte Kahn, Bob Anderson, Richard Bonehill, Tony Clarkin, Peter Diamond, Marjorie Eaton, Mike Edmonds, Stuart Fell, Joe Johnston, Ralph McQuarrie, Treat Williams, Jason Wingreen || Sci-Fi, Fantasy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| The Empire Strikes Back || 20th Century Fox / Lucasfilm || Irvin Kershner (director); Leigh Brackett, Lawrence Kasdan (screenplay); Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, Frank Oz, Alec Guinness, Jeremy Bulloch, John Hollis, Jack Purvis, Clive Revill, Kenneth Colley, Julian Glover, Michael Sheard, Michael Culver, Bruce Boa, Christopher Malcolm, Denis Lawson, Richard Oldfield, John Morton, Ian Liston, John Ratzenberger, Brigitte Kahn, Bob Anderson, Richard Bonehill, Tony Clarkin, Peter Diamond, Marjorie Eaton, Mike Edmonds, Stuart Fell, Joe Johnston, Ralph McQuarrie, Treat Williams, Jason Wingreen || Sci-Fi, Fantasy || Live action"]}, {"page": "List of Doctor Who supporting characters", "response": ["*Delegate Alpha Centauri (body: Stuart Fell; voice: Ysanne Churchman)"]}, {"page": "The Invasion of Time", "response": ["The Sontaran costumes were cumbersome and limited the field of vision of the actors wearing them, so much so that they are often seen tripping through and over props.

The Sontaran Experiment contains the last major role played by Kevin Lindsay before his death in 1975 of a heart condition. He found the heavy Sontaran costume so difficult to manage that he could not leave the Hound Tor location for breaks, and also could not perform the fight scene \u2013 a stand-in, Stuart Fell, was used instead. Terry Walsh not only played a minor role as an astronaut, but doubled for Tom Baker in parts of episode two, after Baker broke a collarbone during filming. This meant that the climactic fight was performed by two stand-ins rather than the original actors. Most of the actors playing the GalSec astronauts were South African. This was specified in the casting, as the writers, Bob Baker and Dave Martin, were interested in language change and reasoned that the multi-linguistic influences on South African English might resemble future developments of the English language."]}, {"page": "The Brain of Morbius", "response": ["It is set on the planet Karn, where the surgeon Mehendri Solon (Philip Madoc) seeks to create a body for the Time Lord war criminal Morbius (Stuart Fell and Michael Spice) from parts of other creatures that have come to the planet."]}, {"page": "The Android Invasion", "response": ["Only three Kraals are seen throughout the story.
