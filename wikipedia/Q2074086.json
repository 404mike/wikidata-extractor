It offered statistical evidence to suggest that there is an exposure threshold of about 200 millisieverts, below which there is no increase in radiation-induced disease. Indeed, it went further, reporting research from Professor Ron Chesser of Texas Tech University, which suggests that low exposures to radiation can have a protective effect. The program interviewed scientists who believe that the increase in thyroid cancer in the immediate area of the explosion had been over-recorded, and predicted that the estimates for widespread deaths in the long term would be proved wrong. It noted the view of the World Health Organization scientist Dr Mike Rapacholi that, while most cancers can take decades to manifest, leukemia manifests within a decade or so: none of the previously expected peak of leukemia deaths has been found, and none is now expected. Identifying the need to balance the \"fear response\" in the public's reaction to radiation, the program quoted Dr Peter Boyle, director of the IARC: \"Tobacco smoking will cause several thousand times more cancers in the [European] population.\"\"Inside Chernobyl's Sarcophagus\" (13 July 1996), Horizon, BBC."]}, {"page": "Devra Davis", "response": ["Davis' second book, The Secret History of the War on Cancer, was published in 2007. In it, she argues medical institutions involved in the \"war on cancer\" have focused more on cures then prevention, and that some safety research into environmental toxicity is conflicted due to funding from companies who make  products suspected of causing harm. James Huff, associate director for chemical carcinogenesis of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, called it \"exhaustively researched and deftly written, illuminat[ing] more of the truth about chemicals and cancer and the relatively simple means of preventing or reducing cancer burdens.\" Epidemiologist Richard Clapp called the book \"a welcome addition to the struggle to correct the imbalance\" between curative and preventative research, while science writer Fred Pearce wrote it \"is a rattling good read and raises vital issues that remain relevant today.\" In a positive review, science journalist Dan Fagin called Davis \"her generation's strongest advocate of the idea that synthetic chemicals are a seriously under-recognized cause of cancer.\"  Medical historian Peter Keating, however, found the book \"largely unoriginal\" and poorly organized. Epidemiologist Peter Boyle wrote that \"devotees of conspiracy theories and aficionados of gossip and innuendo will be drawn towards this book like wasps to a juicy piece of meat\" and discussed how the book suggested that the link between tobacco and cancer was used to distract from other possible sources."]}, {"page": "Peter Boyle (disambiguation)", "response": ["Peter Boyle (1935\u20132006) was an American actor.", "Peter Boyle  may also refer to:", "* Peter Boyle (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u20131939), Irish footballer", "* Peter Boyle (footballer, born 1951), Scottish footballer", "* Peter Boyle (Gaelic footballer), Gaelic football goalkeeper for Donegal", "* Peter Boyle (epidemiologist) (born 1951), Scottish epidemiologist", "* Peter Boyle (film editor) (born 1946), English film editor", "* Peter Boyle (poet) (born 1951), Australian poet"]}]}}
