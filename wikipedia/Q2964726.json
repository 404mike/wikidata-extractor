Greenacre has also been appointed assistant coach to Des Buckingham of the New Zealand national under-20 football team for the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup cycle.\nGreenacre began his career with Manchester City in 1996. Whilst at Maine Road he was sent out on loan to Cardiff City, Blackpool, Scarborough, Northampton Town and Mansfield Town in order to gain first team experience. However, he failed to make the grade at Manchester City and so joined Mansfield Town on a permanent transfer. He became a prolific scorer for the \"Stags\" scoring 58 goals for the club in three seasons. This led to Division One side Stoke City signing him in August 2002. However, despite arriving with high expectations he struggled to cope with the higher level and managed just 9 goals in three seasons at the Britannia Stadium.\nHe left for Tranmere Rovers where he found his level and in four seasons at Tranmere Greenacre scored 53 goals. After his contract expired at Rovers he decided to join New Zealand based, A-League side Wellington Phoenix. He played three seasons for Wellington helping the club to three consecutive finals series places before retiring in 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Cotterill", "response": ["Cotterill left Cheltenham to join First Division side Stoke City in the summer of 2002.

This was followed by a 3\u20134 defeat by Preston North End and narrow losses to Derby County and Burnley.

In the penalty shoot-out, Reddy made two brilliant saves and sent the Phoenix to a home semifinal against Newcastle Jets.

He made his first team debut for Stoke as a late substitute for Chris Greenacre in a 2\u20130 win over Plymouth Argyle in a Championship game at the Britannia Stadium on 16 April 2005. His first start came in a 0\u20130 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road on 25 March 2006. He had dyed his hair red and white before the game, but was sent home to have it cut by manager Tony Pulis. He scored his first goal for the club on 12 September 2006, in a 1\u20131 draw with Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough Stadium. Nine weeks later he joined League Two side Grimsby Town on an initial one-month loan, along with Stoke teammate Anthony Pulis. He scored four goals in his first three appearances for the \"Mariners\". The loan was extended into a third month, and after scoring a total of six goals in his 15 games for Grimsby, manager Alan Buckley said that \"for supporters to sing 'why don't you sign him', we've got to get real... there was never any possibility of us making anything permanent for a player like Martin.\" Wrexham tried to acquire the striker on loan, but he instead remained at Stoke. He played three further games for the \"Potters\" towards the end of the 2006\u201307 season, before departing in the summer. Manager Tony Pulis said that \"it was the right decision to let him go \u2013 in the summer of 2007 \u2013 because there was no way he was going to play in front of Ricardo Fuller\"."]}, {"page": "Bill Dearden", "response": ["Dearden returned to Mansfield Town later in 1999, and was appointed the club's new full-time manager following Steve Parkin's departure.

However, he left the club midway through the 2001\u201302 promotion season to take control of local rivals Notts County.

After being locked at 1\u20131 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected the ball into the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight to the linesman, but the goal stood. \"I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. I spoke to the ref at halftime about it and he said it wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for something like that to change the game is very disappointing.\" Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward, and Eugene Dadi added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that the error changed the dynamics of the game. \"It just rips the heart out of you. We got back in the game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think we were right back in it. They played some good football but I thought we had withstood it OK. If we went into halftime [at 1\u20131] we were really confident we could get something out of it.\" Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.", "On 26 February 2013, with the Phoenix sitting in last place, Ricki Herbert resigned from the position of head coach.  The Phoenix had endured a poor run of results in a season where they were expected to be challenging for the title. Assistant Coach Chris Greenacre took the reins on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. Following a \"worldwide search\", Ernie Merrick was announced as the head coach on 20 May 2013. Merrick had six successful years at the Melbourne Victory, which was seen as important. Merrick will once again become the most experienced A-League coach in the coming season, retaking this from Herbert who passed him towards the end of the 2012\u201313 season. Greenacre was retained by Merrick as the assistant coach.", "On 5 December 2017, Merrick resigned as head coach following the Phoenix's 2\u20130 loss to Adelaide United.
