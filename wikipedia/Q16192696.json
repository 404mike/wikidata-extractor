He played drums for Highway Star, who were to become Stiff Little Fingers, having met two of the other band members at Belfast Boys' Model School. Faloon stayed with SLF long enough to record their first album Inflammable Material but decided the rock 'n' roll lifestyle wasn't for him, so left the band, inspiring the words to SLF's single \"Wait and See\". In the nineties, Faloon occasionally performed as a guest drummer with the SLF tribute band Hanx who went on to become minor Punk band 'The Red Eyes'.As of 2009, he is back in Northern Ireland where he presents a weekly show on local radio.  In 2011 he ran as a candidate for the \"People Before Profit\" party in Belfast South.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stiff Little Fingers", "response": ["Prior to becoming Stiff Little Fingers, Jake Burns, vocals and guitar, Henry Cluney, guitar, Gordon Blair, bass, and Brian Faloon, drums, were playing in a rock music cover band, Highway Star, in Belfast.Cranna, Ian (1979) \"Rough Charm\", Smash Hits, EMAP National Publications Ltd, 4\u201317 October 1979, p.6\u20137 Upon the departure of Blair (who went on to play with another Belfast group, Rudi), Ali McMordie took over on bass.
