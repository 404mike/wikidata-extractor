The book was published under the pseudonym Marcus van Heller, a pen name which Stevenson continued to use for the subsequent novels, making it one of the most famous brand names published at Olympia Press.

This fact and also a negative remark from Girodias regarding the effort he put into writing his most recent novel determined Stevenson to end the collaboration with Olympia Press and return to Britain in 1961. Afterwards, Girodias used the fact that the real identity behind the pen name Marcus van Haller was largely unknown, commissioning other writers to publish new novels under this pen name.", "In a 2003 interview, John Stevenson mentioned that the career turn in the years 1955\u20131961 was unexpected by him. He was far from having a Bohemian lifestyle and his only previous experience of writing consisted in a few features for West Country magazines. He usually kept his real identity separate from this work (his parents never knew anything about it). The unexpected factor was also reflected in the fact that he did not know how to negotiate proper contracts, earning only the lump sum agreed for the first edition and losing any subsequent royalties.", "After returning to Britain, John Stevenson became a civil servant, working as press officer for the Central Office of Information. He ghostwrote a biography of Michael X, From Michael de Freitas to Michael X, published in 1968. In 1969 under the name John X. Under the pen name Stephen John, he began publishing new novels at Berkley Books. I Like It That Way (1969) started a series of seven erotic novels, published in the years 1969\u20131976 and based on a fictional art dealer named Albert Divine."]}]}}
