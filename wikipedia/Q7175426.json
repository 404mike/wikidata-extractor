This was the worst period of the Troubles, nearly 12,000 bombing and shooting incidents had occurred the year before King's appointment, but by the end of his period in command, the figure was down to just under 2,500 a year. His obituary in The Times states that he \"was regarded by many as the best and most successful Director of Operations in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s\", though it also notes that he himself would be happy to attribute much of the preparatory work to Tuzo (who has been described in similar terms). His success was attributable to a number of factors: he regularly visited the troops on the ground which gave him a good picture of the difficulties faced in particular areas; once a unit or commander had proved itself, he was happy to delegate considerable authority, in particular to his immediate subordinate, Commander Land Forces (Sir) Peter Leng; he had a good relationship with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, who said of King \"You have never played at politics and I have never played at being a soldier; that's why we have got on so well.\" He was replaced in the post by Lieutenant-General Sir David House on 1 August 1975. King was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1976 New Year Honours."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2009", "response": ["*Sir Peter Leng, 83, British Army general."]}, {"page": "List of British Army full generals", "response": ["| Sir Peter Leng"]}, {"page": "List of Old Bradfieldians", "response": ["* General Sir Peter Leng (1925\u20132009), British Army officer and Master-General of the Ordnance"]}, {"page": "Leng, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Leng"]}]}}
