The left-arm spinner, nicknamed \"Fergie\", took more than 1,000 wickets over his twenty three-year career, and fell just six runs short of hitting 10,000 first-class runs for Yorkshire. His bowling partnership with Geoff Cope was a successful one for the county. He captained Yorkshire to victory over Northamptonshire in the 1987 Benson & Hedges Cup, having had his benefit season in 1985. As well as Yorkshire he spent two seasons playing in South Africa with Eastern Province and Northern Transvaal. After retiring from first-class cricket in 1993, he continued to play local league cricket, captaining Pudsey Congs to the Bradford League title and he also had success as an umpire for the ECB.\nHe died of leukaemia aged 47 in January 2000, survived by his wife and two daughters. His funeral was held in Bradford Cathedral. Among those attending were his cricketing colleagues Brian Close, Ray Illingworth, Martyn Moxon, Dickie Bird, Graham Gooch, Mike Gatting and John Emburey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["His success on the field resumed in 1985, where he scored 1,657\u00a0runs at 75.31, second only to Viv Richards in the national averages. He also shared a record opening partnership of 351 with Martyn Moxon. In contrast to the poor relations between Boycott and the senior players, many junior members of the team remember 1985 and 1986 as pleasant times to be around Boycott, who often coached them on their technique.McKinstry, p. 253. 1986 saw Boycott score 890\u00a0runs at 52.35, his season cut short by injuries which were becoming more frequent as he passed the age of 45.McKinstry, p. 255. This season was the first since 1962 that he had not hit an overall total of 1,000\u00a0runs; he finished eight short in his final match, when he was run out for 61. He advised the then captain to enforce the follow-on, and did not bat again. Since 1984, support for Boycott had waned in light of his slow scoring, multiple injuries and the general atmosphere around him. Both Brian Close and Ray Illingworth increasingly advocated his removal to Yorkshire's committee, and on 23 September 1986 it was confirmed that he would not be offered a contract for the following year. A few months later, captain David Bairstow, a long term ally of Boycott whose leadership had Boycott's support, was ruled out of the running for captaincy for the following season, which was instead given to Phil Carrick, of whom Boycott disapproved. Boycott paid tribute to the Reform Group in 1987, describing them as \"dedicated Yorkshire members with a heartfelt stake in their club.\" He suggests that Close and Illingworth feared his popularity.Boycott, p. 297. Boycott was offered contracts by other counties, including Derbyshire and Glamorgan, but he never took these offers up, nor played professional cricket again.McKinstry, pp. 257\u2013258. At the time of his retirement he had scored more first-class runs than any other active player.Boycott, p. 375."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Geoff Boycott captained Yorkshire for most of the 1970s, but competitive success eluded the team even when Boycott left Test cricket for three years to concentrate on the county game. He was sacked as captain amid much internal furore after the 1978 season. Ray Illingworth returned from Leicestershire as team manager and, in 1982 at the age of 50, took over the captaincy. Yorkshire finished bottom of the 17-strong County Championship for the first time in 1983 but won the John Player (later National) League for the first time. There was further controversy when Boycott was not offered a new contract. The outcome of this was that the general committee resigned and Boycott, having already been elected to the new committee, was reinstalled as a player. Meanwhile, Brian Close became chairman of the cricket committee. Success continued to elude Yorkshire although Phil Carrick led the team to a Benson and Hedges Cup triumph in 1987."]}, {"page": "International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981", "response": ["The members of touring party were (England unless stated): Phil Carrick, Trevor Chappell (Australia), Geoff Cope, John Douglas (Australia), Frank Hayes, Mike Hendrick, Geoff Howarth (New Zealand), Andrew Kennedy, Peter Lee, David Lloyd (captain), Derek Randall, Phil Slocombe, David Steele, Fred Titmus, Roger Tolchard, Gary Troup (New Zealand), Dav Whatmore (Australia)."]}, {"page": "Bob Taylor (cricketer)", "response": ["On 10 June 1981, the touring Australian side faced Derbyshire in Derby in a three-day drawn match.
