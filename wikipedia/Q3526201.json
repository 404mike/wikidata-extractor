Nicknamed \"Typhoon Tyson\" by the press, he was regarded by many commentators as one of the fastest bowlers ever seen in cricket and took 76 wickets (18.56) in 17 Test matches. Tyson has the seventh-lowest bowling average in Test cricket for bowlers who have taken 75 wickets, and no bowler since Tyson has taken more than 20 wickets at a lower average. In 2007 a panel of judges declared him Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for 1955 due to his outstanding tour of Australia in 1954\u201355 where his 28 wickets (20.82) was instrumental in retaining the Ashes.

He spoke with such vehemence that Tyson asked George Duckworth who the old gent was, \"That was Douglas Jardine\", a fellow Oxford University man who had come down especially to see Cowdrey. Soon after the voyage began Cowdrey and Tyson were warned by the captain Len Hutton that they were secondary players who were expected to play little part in the Test matches, but in the end their efforts would prove decisive in England's victory.Frank Tyson, In the Eye of the Typhoon: The Inside Story of the MCC Tour of Australia and New Zealand 1954/55, Parrs Wood Press (2004), pp. 23, 252 They traveled first-class on the Orsova which took six weeks to arrive in Western Australia, after stopping for a one-day game against Ceylon, where Cowdrey made 66 not out.

As Frank Tyson recalled, \"Runs did not flow; they were grafted from a pitch which kept the batsman hopping around as delivery after delivery tickled their ribs. Colin was icily superb. For four hours his concentration never wavered...he stroked the ball through the cover and mid-wicket gaps in the field. Shooters became more frequent, but Colin dug them out. When I joined him at the wicket he was a run short of his maiden Test century: a goal he achieved with a scampered single. If he ever scored a better hundred I hope that I am there to see it\".Tyson, p. 149.

Later on the tour he struck 101 runs in 84 minutes with 10 boundaries to win a jovial match against the Prime Minister's XI by four wickets. England lost the first two Tests, but Cowdrey's 100 not out saved the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, adding 182 with May (92) and spending 80 minutes in the 90s. Cowdrey's 84 could not save the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, and he was bowled by the 'Blond Giant' Gordon Rorke, whose seven-foot stride and his long drag took him three yards down the wicket before he released the ball,Frith, p. 437 and Cowdrey joked \"I was frightened that he might tread on my toes\".Frank Tyson, The Cricketer Who Laughed, Stanley Paul, 1982, p. 59 The Fifth Test saw Cowdrey in fine form with seven boundaries in his 44, but he was run out when he trotted in for a single, even though the umpire was unsighted by the wicket-keeper Wally Grout. Cowdrey took strike again unaware of his dismissal until he was asked to depart. England lost the Test as Australia recovered the Ashes 4\u20130. Cowdrey made only 20 runs (10.00) in the follow up tour of New Zealand, which England won 1\u20130. ", "Cowdrey showed he had lost none of his timing and that his bat was as straight as ever until he was bowled behind his legs by Thomson (2/45) for 22. In the second innings he volunteered to open with David Lloyd instead of the badly bruised Brian Luckhurst. Cowdrey was dropped by Ian Redpath off Lillee, hit on the arm, survived a confident appeal by Rod Marsh before he was finally caught lbw by Thomson for 41, his highest score of the series. After the Second Test Cowdrey made 78 and took 2/27 against South Australia. Before the Third Test at Melbourne Frank Tyson recalled \"Colin Cowdrey and John Edrich were unable to practice on Christmas Eve \u2013 mainly because of the drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace. Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, I volunteered the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, in which I was a partner, for a two-hour work-out on Christmas morning. It was quite a contrast to open the children's presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen old son, Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents\".Tyson, p. 85 He played his 114th and last Test at Melbourne, and opened the innings again as Lloyd was injured, but only made 7. Even so, England made 529 and won by an innings, with Cowdrey dismissing Rick McCosker for his 120th catch.

He was described in The Complete Encyclopaedia of Cricket as \"one of the greatest opening batsmen that the game has known. He dedicated his life to the art of batting, practising assiduously and eschewing any shot that might even hint at threatening the loss of his wicket.\" Through his Test career, he scored 15.4% of England's runs, and England won 32.41% of the Tests in which Boycott played. This compares with England's 34.76% victory rate over all Test cricket history. Richard Hutton, Yorkshire and England batsman and son of Len Hutton, described Boycott as a \"one-pace player\", suggesting that he was unable to alter his playing pace as the match circumstances dictated.McKinstry, p. 114. Nevertheless, Boycott maintained an \"impeccable\" defensive technique, and possessed a temperament ideally suited for five-day Test matches.McKinstry, p. 51. Arlott wrote that \"his technique is based on a defence organised as near flawlessness as may be.\"Arlott, p. 127. Boycott himself remarked, in 1981, that: \"Given the choice between Raquel Welch and a hundred at Lord's, I'd take the hundred every time.\" His careful batting is reflected in his 22 centuries for England, of which only two had a strike rate of over 51.00. Former England bowler Frank Tyson wrote in 1987, in The Test Within, that \"the greatness of Boycott the batsman and the gaffes of Boycott the man had common roots in an unceasing quest after perfection.\" Boycott also kept a black book which he used to record bowlers' tendencies."]}, {"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Yorkshire initially replaced Aspinall with Frank McHugh but then brought Trueman back in June before dropping him in July in order to try out Foord and Whitehead.Arlott, pp. 26\u201327.

Opening the bowling with Statham, he took two for 73, which was expensive, and none for 39 while Statham won the match for England with two for 49 and a brilliant seven for 39. That was Trueman's only Test in 1955 as Frank Tyson was recalled for the third Test at Old Trafford. There was no Test tour in 1955\u201356 so Trueman had to wait a whole year for his next chance to play for England.", "Trueman was selected for the first Test against West Indies and kept his place for the entire series.Arlott, p. 93. He was England's leading wicket-taker with 22 at 20.68. His great partnership with Statham began in earnest and for six years the pair were a formidable presence in international cricket, Statham noted for his accuracy and persistence, Trueman for his rhythm and dynamics. Trueman's selection in this series can be put into some perspective by the fact that his great rival Frank Tyson achieved 100 wickets in a season for the first time, yet Trueman was now clearly considered England's best option to partner Statham. As Arlott recounts, the third Test at Trent Bridge featured \"one of the finest sustained bowling performances of Trueman's life\".Arlott, p. 94. In a high-scoring match which was eventually drawn, Trueman and Statham took 15 wickets between them from a combined 135 overs, which is a considerable total for two pace bowlers. In the context of the match, they were both outstanding and their joint performance was acclaimed as the first major success in a partnership that the selectors now regarded as long-term. England did not have an overseas tour in the winter of 1957\u201358.", "John Warr, with whom Trueman shared his first-class debut, wrote that from the beginning of his career, Trueman's run-up was \"curving and long but nicely modulated\". David Frith continued with Trueman reaching the wicket, where he turned his body side-on and cocked back his ball-carrying right arm, as the leading left arm was hoisted, before \"an awesome cartwheel\" sent him into a follow through which \"resembled a Sea Fury finishing its mission along the runway of an aircraft carrier\".Frith, p. 169. Warr said Trueman's final stride had a \"pronounced drag\" which caused him some difficulties when the front-foot rule was introduced. His bowling arm was kept high through the delivery stride, to generate extra bounce and pace off the pitch, and the movement of the ball was \"predominantly away from the bat\" (i.e., the out-swinger). Trueman himself maintained that his ability to bowl outswingers consistently was \"another new ingredient I brought to the county game\". As Maurice Leyland said to him: \"Keep bowling those outswingers, Fred, and you'll be all right. That's the one that gets the great batsmen out!\" Trueman acknowledged that other great fast bowlers who could bowl the outswinger well were Ray Lindwall and Wes Hall; but Brian Statham and Frank Tyson could not.Ball of Fire, p. 57."]}, {"page": "Middleton Cricket Club", "response": ["Middleton Cricket Club, based in Middleton, in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, Greater Manchester are an English Cricket team currently playing in the Lancashire Cricket League.

Hutton further downplayed his team's chances through exaggerating its inexperience to the Australian press; newspapers were already sympathetic to Hutton as a professional captain of a class-driven country.Marshall, p. 165. The team began the tour well. Hutton made a series of good scores in the opening games.Howat, p. 152. But for the first Test, Hutton did not include a spinner in the team and chose to bowl on winning the toss, an unusual strategy in Australia. The home side scored 601, England dropped 12 catches and, with the key players Evans and Compton injured, lost by an innings; the press blamed Hutton for choosing to bowl.Howat, p. 153. Despite the result, Hutton saw potential in Frank Tyson's bowling and arranged for Alf Gover, a respected coach who was in Australia as a journalist, to improve and shorten Tyson's run to the wicket.Howat, p. 154. For the second Test, Hutton left out the unfit Alec Bedser, England's most reliable bowler since the war, to include two spinners,Howat, p. 155. but in a low-scoring game, Tyson made the difference and England won by 38 runs. Hutton was unwell before the third Test, suffering from fibrositis and a heavy cold, and had to be persuaded out of bed by members of his team. He decided to play at the last minute and unexpectedly left out Bedser again, although he was fit to play. Hutton neglected to inform Bedser, who only learned of his omission when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match.Howat, pp. 156\u201357. Hutton contributed few runs, but Cowdrey and Peter May made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128-run victory. The fourth Test was crucial, and Hutton's innings of 80 runs in four-and-a-half hours was the highest of the game. Wisden believed Hutton's tactics were instrumental in giving his team the upper hand, and in the final innings, England needed 94 to win and retain the Ashes. Early wickets, including Hutton's, fell to Miller, and when the captain returned to the dressing room, he said that Miller had \"done us again.\" Compton, the next man in, replied \"I haven't been in yet\", and stayed at the wicket until the match was won by five wickets. Many commentators viewed this as a sign that Hutton's reserve had slipped in the critical situation, but Alan Gibson believes it was a deliberate ploy to inspire Compton.Gibson, p. 88. England went on to draw the final Test in a match ruined by rain. Hutton was out to the fourth ball of the match, but Australia were forced to follow on for the first time by England since 1938, and Hutton took a wicket with the last ball of the match before time ran out.

He also failed on his only chance of an Ashes tour. After another successful season in 1951, Shackleton was chosen to tour India in 1951/1952, but though accurate he lacked penetration on the slow Indian turf.  With Alec Bedser, and later Fred Trueman, Brian Statham and Frank Tyson providing England's with penetrating pace bowling, Shackleton had no opportunities in Test cricket for over a decade."]}, {"page": "Bill Johnston (cricketer)", "response": ["In the Second Test at Sydney, Johnston took 3/56 and 3/70 in a low-scoring match, removing Hutton in both innings. He had another notable innings when he joined Neil Harvey with 78 runs needed for victory on a difficult batting surface against the hostile pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. In particular, Tyson was bowling with a strong tailwind and a slips cordon standing around 40 yards behind the bat.Tom Graveney and Norman Giller (1988) The Ten Greatest Test Teams. Sidgwick & Jackson. p. 125.  They put together a stubborn 39 run tenth-wicket partnership in 40 minutes,Haigh, p. 89. which gave Australia hope of an unlikely victory with Harvey still attacking. Harvey felt that Tyson was almost out of energy after a spell of extreme pace, and that the remaining bowlers were not beyond Johnston.Haigh, p. 90. However, a Tyson ball that was aimed at the ribcage saw Johnston fend at the ball; he was caught behind for 11, giving England a dramatic victory. After taking 1/26 in the first innings, Johnston took 5/85 in the second innings of his last Test performance in front of his home crowd at the MCG, with some tight spin on a dry surface.Haigh, p. 92. He removed Edrich for 13 and Peter May for 91 before cleaning up the tail with three quick wickets. This left Australia 240 to win but there was to be no fairytale as England won by 128 runs.Perry, pp. 356\u2013357. Johnston then took match figures of 4/80 in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, in what was to be his last Test on Australian soil. Australia lost the match and England retained the Ashes; it was Australia's third consecutive Test defeat, the first time they had suffered a hat-trick of defeats since the infamous Bodyline series of 1932\u201333. Johnston had less success outside the Tests, which were played on bowler-friendly surfaces. He managed only 13 wickets at 30.38 in five matches.", "Johnston had a reputation as a poor batsman, averaging less than 13 in Tests and first-class matches without making a half century. He headed the averages in England in 1953, being not out 16 times out of 17 and averaging 102.00. He attributed this to \"a lot of application, concentration and dedication\", stating that \"class always tells\". When Hassett realised that Johnston was atop the batting averages, he told Johnston to tell the opposing captain of this fact and ask them to refrain from dismissing him. In the last match against T. N. Pearce's XI at Scarborough, English Test paceman Alec Bedser bowled wide of the stumps and advised Johnston not to do anything that would lose him his wicket. In 1954\u201355 he made 39 for the last wicket with Neil Harvey as they chased 78 for victory before he edged Frank Tyson to the wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. ", "\"Bill Johnston did his bit for his team with true Aussie grit. His speciality stroke was a right-handed, one-handed, back-handed, glancing scoop off the line of his bum \u2013 cricket's equivalent of tennis' back-handed retrieve. It bought him a dozen runs \u2013 plus a considerable amount of pain when he failed to make contact and the ball clipped his maximus gluteus!\" \u2013 Frank Tyson, In the Eye of the Typhoon.Frank Tyson (2004) In the Eye of the Typhoon.
