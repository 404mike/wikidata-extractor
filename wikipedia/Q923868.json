The film tells the life story of Nemo Nobody, a 118-year-old man who is the last mortal on Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. Nemo, memory fading, refers to his three main loves and to his parents' divorce and subsequent hardships endured at three critical junctions in his life: at age nine, fifteen, and thirty-four. Alternate life paths branching out from each of those critical junctions are examined. The speculative narrative often changes course with the flick of a different possible decision at each of those ages. The film uses nonlinear narrative and the multiverse hypothesis style.", "* Jared Leto as Nemo Nobody, both 34- and 118-year-old. Nemo is a Latin word meaning \"nobody\". The name Nemo alludes to Captain Nemo, the main character of Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. It is the false name that Odysseus in Homer's poem Odyssey gives to the cyclops Polyphemus, to deceive him and save his own life. Van Dormael said that Leto was chosen because he is \"an actor who could transform himself, as much physically as vocally, rhythmically, his breathing.\" Leto described his role saying, \"Mr. Nobody is everyone and no one all at the same time, an illusion, the product of his own dreams. He's love, he's hope, he's fear, he's life and he's death. This is without doubt the most complex character I've ever played. It was a challenge to keep all these lives concentrated into one character for the duration of the filming without losing myself. But we had outlines and things that helped me to keep track of where we were.\" Actor Toby Regbo portrays Nemo at fifteen.", "Boyd van Hoeij of Variety magazine was more critical, writing \"Though a lot of it is well written and directed and, quite often, funny or poignant, the individual scenes rarely become part of a larger whole.\" He praises Leto's acting, stating \"The closest the film comes to having a gravitational center are in the scenes set in 2092. What makes them soar is not the imaginative staging of the future, but Leto's performance. His acting talent really comes into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth.\" He also praised Regbo and Temple, saying \"Regbo, as the teenage Nemo, and Juno Temple, as the teenage Anna, are impressive, bringing the hormonal battles of adolescence vividly to life.\" Film critic Eric Lavall\u00e9e listed Regbo as one of his \"Top 10 New Faces & Voices\" of 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. He notes that \"newbie Toby Regbo might easily be Mr. Nobody's most \"alive\" character.

Notable events of that period include the foundation of powerful Houses, the Long Night when the White Walkers first descended upon Westeros, and the Andal Invasion when the Andals invaded from Essos and conquered most of Westeros. Martin suggested The Long Night as a title for the series. S. J. Clarkson was announced to direct and executive produce the pilot, while Naomi Watts was cast as the female lead playing \"a charismatic socialite hiding a dark secret\".
