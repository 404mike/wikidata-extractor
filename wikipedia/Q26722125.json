At the ensuing by-election, his son John Forster was elected as a Whig candidate. Forster attempted to regain the seat at the 1857 general election but ranked bottom of the poll.Forster, \"a wealthy and highly respected ship-owner and merchant\" had mining interests, as a senior partner in Forster, Smith and Company, in both south County Durham and The Gambia.In 1840 Richard Robert Madden (the Special Commissioner of Inquiry into the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa) reported that Forster was one of the London-based merchants who were actively (and illegally) helping the slave traders. However, Forster managed to escape criminal prosecution. In 1841 there was a change of government, and the new government chose not to send the matter to the Queen's Bench, but to a House of Commons committee that Forster himself was part of. Unsurprisingly, this committee rejected most of Madden's findings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Letitia Elizabeth Landon", "response": ["Landon began to \"[talk] of marrying any one, and of wishing to get away, from England, and from those who had thus misunderstood her\".Thomson (1860), 166.

However, the formal division of the state in 1808 into eight separate lands - based on the structure of the underleases pertaining to the estates formal houses - allowed the church to maximise its income, and hence to allow additional substantial houses to be built on the lands. This income allowed the church to have Belsize House rebuilt in 1812 for additional letting income. The wealthy leaseholders soon enabled themselves to purchase the freehold from the church, allowing the accelerated development of Belsize as a Victorian country urban suburb of London. One of the new land owners George Todd redeveloped what was known as the White House in 1815 as a substantial Georgian stucco-villa with portico, and two lodges. Known as Belsize House, it was later sold to Matthew Forster (1786 \u2013 1869) the Whig MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed as Belsize Lodge - it was demolished in 1937."]}, {"page": "Berwick-upon-Tweed (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Matthew Forster"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Berwick-upon-Tweed(two members)||Matthew Forster||Liberal"]}, {"page": "Richard Robert Madden", "response": ["In 1840 Madden became Her Majesty's Special Commissioner of Inquiry into the British Settlements on the West Coast of Africa.
