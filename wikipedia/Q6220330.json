(died 1804), was an Irish divine.\nBaird came to Dublin from the Isle of Man, and was ordained minister of the presbyterian congregation of Capel Street 11 January 1767. Here he ministered for ten years, not very happily, and in 1777 he was compelled to resign. Shortly after doing so he brought out the first and only volume of a projected series on the Old Testament; a work of some learning, originally delivered as lectures at Capel Street, and dedicated (12 November 1777) to James Trail, bishop of Down. Baird soon afterwards conformed, and on 7 Sep 1782 was appointed by the crown to the rectory of Cloghran, near Dublin, where he died unmarried early in 1804. He published 'Dissertations, Chronological, Historical, and Critical, of all the Books of the Old Testament; through which are interspersed Reflections, Theological and Moral,' &c., Dublin, 1778, vol. i. (extending to Exod. xx.)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Baird", "response": ["John Baird may refer to:", "*John Baird (American football), All-American football player", "*John Baird (Australian footballer) (born 1980), Australian rules footballer", "*John Baird (cyclist), former racing cyclist from New Zealand", "*John Baird (footballer, born 1870) (1870\u20131905), Scottish footballer", "*John Baird (footballer, born 1985), Scottish footballer playing for Forfar Athletic", "*John Baird, Lord Newbyth (1620\u20131698), Scottish advocate, judge, politician and diplomat", "*John Baird (Canadian politician) (born 1969), Canadian politician and former cabinet minister", "*John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven (1874\u20131941), eighth Governor-General of Australia", "*John Baird (Michigan politician) (1859\u20131934), Michigan State Representative and Senator", "*Sir John Baird, 2nd Baronet (1686\u20131745), Scottish Member of Parliament for Edinburghshire", "*John Baird (North West Lanarkshire MP) (1852\u20131900), Member of Parliament, 1885\u20131886", "*John Baird (Wolverhampton MP) (1906\u20131965), British Labour Party Member of Parliament, 1945\u20131964", "*John Baird (revolutionary) (1790\u20131820), Scottish commander in the \"Radical War\" of 1820", "*John Baird (Royal Navy officer) (1832\u20131908), Victorian British Admiral", "*John Baird (educator) (1795\u20131858), Irish-born British Army instructor", "*John Baird (RAF officer) (born 1937), British physician and retired Royal Air Force medical officer", "*John Baird (Irish divine) (died 1804)", "*John Baird (Scottish divine) (1799\u20131861)", "*John Baird, founder of the Create a Comic Project", "*John Baird I (1798\u20131859), Glasgow architect"]}]}}
