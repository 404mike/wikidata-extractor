As such, he was a member of the First D\u00e1il, though he could not attend the first meeting as he was in prison.He was elected unopposed as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Cork Mid, North, South, South East and West constituency at the 1921 elections. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted for it. He did not contest the 1922 general election.He was deputy governor (and effectively in charge) of Mountjoy Prison during the Irish Civil War of 1922\u20131923, where he was popular with the prisoners, despite being on the opposing side. In his vivid civil war memoir, The Gates Flew Open, Peadar O'Donnell devotes a chapter to how O'Keeffe was relentlessly mocked by the prisoners who called him 'Paudeen.'  He was assistant clerk of Seanad \u00c9ireann from 1938 until his retirement in 1947.", "link_mentions": {}}}
