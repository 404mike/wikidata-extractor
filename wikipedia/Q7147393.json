He was assistant clerk of Seanad \u00c9ireann from 1938 until his retirement in 1947.\n\n\t\t\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1973 in Ireland", "response": ["* 20 September \u2013 Patrick O'Keeffe, member of First D\u00e1il representing North Cork."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: O", "response": ["*Patrick O'Keeffe"]}, {"page": "Frongoch internment camp", "response": ["*Patrick O'Keeffe"]}, {"page": "North Cork (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Patrick O'Keeffe"]}, {"page": "List of Sinn F\u00e9in MPs", "response": ["| Patrick O'Keeffe"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Patrick O'Keeffe"]}, {"page": "O'Keeffe", "response": ["* Patrick O'Keeffe (politician) (died 1973), Irish politician", "* Patrick O'Keeffe (writer) (born 1964), Irish-American short story writer"]}, {"page": "Padraig O'Keeffe", "response": ["There is no great consistency in the spelling of the anglicised version of his name.

Despite her family's disapproval, Kelly was a member of Cumann na mBan, serving in the GPO in the Easter Rising. She joined the office staff of Sinn F\u00e9in in their headquarters at 6 Harcourt Street, Dublin in 1917. There, she worked as secretary and general assistant to Patrick O'Keeffe, the party's general secretary. In this role she was the minute taker at numerous meetings including the party's central council. For the inaugural sitting of the first D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 21 January 1919, she prepared notes. She later served as a secretary to Michael Collins, preparing briefings for foreign correspondents, typed and mimeographed the news sheet of the D\u00e1il department of publicity, and assisting in the collating and composing Irish Bulletin from 1919 to 1921. She did all of this during the dangerous and underground times of the Irish War of Independence. Throughout this time she was known as \"Miss Fitz\", retaining the lifelong nicknames of \"Fitz\" and \"Fitzie\". During the Irish Civil War she worked on the Republican War News, an anti-treaty publication, which led to her arrest by Free State authorities in late 1922. She was imprisoned in Mountjoy, then Kilmainham where she went on hunger strike, and then the North Dublin Union from which she escaped with a number of fellow female prisoners, but was rearrested in May 1923. After the ceasefire, she was released."]}]}}
