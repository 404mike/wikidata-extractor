In 1877, Ferreira raised a unit called Ferreira's Horse for the first time. Early in 1879, Ferreira and his new unit took part with other British forces in the Anglo-Zulu War in Zululand against the Zulu leader King Cetshwayo. The unit was said to consist of 115 men serving with the colonial cavalry under Colonel Redvers Henry Buller. Later in the same year on 28 November 1879, Ferreira took part in the Sekhukhune Campaign in the North-eastern Transvaal, where he again commanded the Ferreira's Horse. The British and Native force under the command of Colonel Baker Russell would attack the stronghold of the Pedi tribes leader, King Sekukune in the Sekhukhuneland. The tribe, having taken refuge in a mountain stronghold, was assaulted by Ferreira and the British and native forces over several days before the tribal king surrendered on 2 Dec 1879 to him. For his effort in the campaign he was appointed Companion of Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (CMG). In late 1880s, Ferreira and his horseman would take part in the Basuto War. It was raised for a third time outside Pretoria, also known as the Transvaal Horse, and would assist the Cape Colony to put down the Basuto rebels and took with it two 9-pounder field guns. It was disbanded in 1881 and at that time had a strength of 450 men."]}]}}
