He made his Premier League debut for City during the 2006\u201307 season and went on to become somewhat of a first team regular. While with City he was an England youth international, for both the under-19 and under-21 teams.\nSeveral injury setbacks that started during the 2008\u201309 season hampered his progress and he went on to only make four appearances for City in his final five years of his contract, playing his final match in a League Cup tie against Scunthorpe United in 2009. During the 2011\u201312 season Johnson was loaned out to Leicester City on a season long loan deal, but it was cut short due to injury. He was released from his contract with Manchester City in December 2012, over two years since his last appearance for the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Johnson", "response": ["Michael Johnson or Mike Johnson may refer to:", "*Michael Johnson (singer) (1944\u20132017), American pop, country and folk singer-songwriter and guitarist", "*Michael Johnson (drummer) (born 1982), American pop singer and drummer", "*Michael Johnson (known by his stage name Twisted Insane; born 1981), American rapper and songwriter", "*Michael Johnson (safety) (born 1984), American football player for the Detroit Lions. 2011\u2013, New York Giants, 2007\u20132010", "*Michael Johnson (defensive end) (born 1987), American football player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 2014-, for the Cincinnati Bengals, 2009\u20132013", "*Michael Johnson (footballer, born 1941) (1941\u20131991), Welsh international footballer (Swansea City)", "*Michael Johnson (footballer, born 1973), English-born Jamaican international footballer and manager", "*Michael Johnson (footballer, born 1988), English footballer (Manchester City)", "*Michael Johnson (footballer, born 1990), Caymanian footballer", "*Michael Johnson (footballer, born 1994), Maltese footballer", "*Michael Johnson (sprinter) (born 1967), American World and Olympic Champion sprinter", "*Michael Johnson (canoeist) (born 1941), American Olympic canoer", "*Michael Johnson (sport shooter) (born 1973), New Zealand World and Paralympic Champion shooter", "*Michael Johnson (Australian rules footballer) (born 1984), Australian rules player for the Fremantle Dockers, 2005\u20132018", "*Michael Johnson (fighter) (born 1986), American mixed martial arts fighter", "*Michael Johnson (cricketer) (born 1988), Australian cricketer", "*Michael Johnson (Gaelic footballer), former Antrim Gaelic footballer", "*Michael Johnson (field hockey) (born 1979), British former field hockey player", "*Michael Johnson (bodybuilder), Canadian bodybuilder", "*Michael Johnson (Australian politician) (born 1970), member of the Australian House of Representatives", "* Michael Johnson (Alaska politician) (born 1972)", "*Michael Johnson (Wisconsin politician) (1832\u20131908), Reform member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "*Michael Johnson (criminal) (1977\u20132006), committed suicide before his execution in 2006 for the murder of Jeff Wetterman", "*Michael Johnson (graphic designer) (born 1964), British graphic designer", "*Crispus Attucks (1723\u20131770), sailor who may have used the alias \"Michael Johnson\"", "*Michael Johnson (actor) (1939\u20132001), British actor in films and TV series such as The Human Jungle"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|6||MF||align=\"left\"| Michael Johnson", "| Michael Johnson", "| Michael Johnson"]}, {"page": "Michael Johnson (English footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Johnson (footballer, born 1988)"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|6||MF||align=\"left\"| Michael Johnson"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|| 6||||Michael Johnson     ||MF||  1 ||    ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   || 1 || 1 ||   ||   ||  2 ||  1 ||    ||", "| 6|| Michael Johnson || MF ||  0 || 0 || 1 ||  1"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["| Michael Johnson*", "| Michael Johnson"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|  Michael Johnson"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|  Michael Johnson"]}, {"page": "Priory Hospital", "response": ["*Michael Johnson"]}, {"page": "Manchester United F.C. 4\u20133 Manchester City F.C.
