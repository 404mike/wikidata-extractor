Protecting Joe Wright's goal was his namesake Jim Wright and Dick Hill while former Arsenal centre half Jack Butler was flanked in the midfield by Smith and Billy Clayson.  Clayson was unusually playing in the right half position having been replaced in his more accustomed role of inside forward by Harry Keeling in the previous match, an away trip to Gillingham.  Having scored two goals in that game, Keeling retained his position in the forward line forcing Clayson to make the switch into midfield, pushing Jim Wright into the right back position at the expense of Jack Fowler.  Taking the outside forward positions were Harry Waller and William Bell with Albert Hutchinson and potent centre forward Jimmy Trotter completing the forward line.

The former Plymouth Argyle left-half joined Torquay in 1928 and reached the century milestone in January 1931, narrowly beating full-back Jack Fowler to the honor by a few weeks.  Despite this, Fowler would eventually overtake Smith and set the Torquay appearance record at 190 in 1934.  However, the player with the most pre-War appearances for Torquay was Albert Hutchinson.  Beginning his career as a forward, Hutchinson eventually played at every position for Torquay (including the goalkeeper) before the Football League was abandoned in September 1939, by which point he had notched up 338 appearances for the club."]}]}}
