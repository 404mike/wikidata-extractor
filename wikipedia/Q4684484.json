At this time, a small weatherboard cottage with associated outbuildings and stables, known as Hampton Cottage, existed on the site, which may have been built by Hunt. Ownership of the property changed in quick succession during the early 1800s between real estate speculators before it was purchased by Hunt in 1847. In 1801 the 1800 land grant to William Balmain was transferred to John Gilchrist, to discharge Balmain's debts to Gilchrist. Gilchrist sold the original land grant in six parcels, including three lots to Thomas Hynde in 1837. Ownership was transferred in 1840 to John Terry Hughes who headed a consortium of speculators, and was again transferred in 1841 to Adolphus William Young when Hughes defaulted on his loan from Young. In 1847 Hunt purchased Lots 1-3 and 5 of Young's subdivision. The land title deeds were held by Young until the purchase price of 1,100 pounds (plus additional interest etc.) was repaid by Hunt to Young in 1851. Hunt appears to have been the first owner of the property to repay the loan for its purchase or other loans on the property and to therefore retain its ownership. Edward Hunt and his widow owned and occupied Hampton Villa for 35 years, and the Hunt family owned the property for nearly 50 years."]}, {"page": "Commissioner of Corrective Services (New South Wales)", "response": ["|Adolphus William Young"]}]}}
