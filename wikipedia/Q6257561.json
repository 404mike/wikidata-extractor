Following his car's failure to finish in the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans race after a hideously violent accident while John Sheldon was driving, Attwood retired from front line racing for good. With the growth in popularity of historic motorsport, he frequently appeared in events and Porsche shows with his own Porsche 917, which Steve McQueen used in his film Le Mans. The car was painted to represent his 1970 Le Mans-winner, and Attwood referred to it as \"my pension\", as the value of the car had risen rapidly over the decades since he bought it in the 1970s. In 2000 Atwood cashed-in his pension, when he sold the car in an auction for \u00a31\u00a0million. Today he is still very active in historic motorsport, often making memorable appearances at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, among many yearly excursions.", "|align=\"left\"|  Mike Salmon John Sheldon"]}, {"page": "Martin Birrane", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  John Sheldon Neil Crang"]}, {"page": "Tim Harvey", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Chris Hodgetts John Sheldon"]}, {"page": "1992 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Luigi Taverna Alessandro Gini John Sheldon"]}, {"page": "1991 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  John Sheldon Ferdinand de Lesseps Charles Rickett"]}, {"page": "1990 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Ian Harrower John Sheldon Jerry Mahony"]}, {"page": "1989 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Max Cohen-Olivar John Sheldon Robin Donovan"]}, {"page": "1988 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Tim Harvey Chris Hodgetts John Sheldon"]}, {"page": "1987 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Thorkild Thyrring John Sheldon Ian Harrower"]}, {"page": "1986 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Nick Nicholson John Sheldon Thorkild Thyrring"]}, {"page": "1985 24 Hours of Le Mans", "response": ["During Thursday's practice, Briton driver Dudley Wood in a John Fitzpatrick entered Porsche 962C tangled with the Swiss driver Jean-Pierre Frey in an Alba AR2 on the Mulsanne Straight at 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h).
