In the 2000s, a quieter style emerged, with largely impressionistic lyrics, from artists such as Norah Jones, Conor Oberst, Sufjan Stevens, David Bazan, South San Gabriel, Iron & Wine, David Gray, Ray LaMontagne, Meg Hutchinson, Darden Smith, Josh Rouse, Steve Millar, Jolie Holland, Patrick Duff, Richard Buckner, Jewel, Jack Savoretti, Richard Shindell, John Gorka, and Antje Duvekot. Some started to branch out in new genres such as Kurt Cobain, Noel Gallagher, T Bone Burnett, Eddie Vedder, and Pete Yorn. Others used drugs as a mind-altering way to boost creativity; for example, Emil Amos of Holy Sons took drugs daily from age sixteen on, wrote over 1,000 songs, and landed a record contract with an indie label."]}, {"page": "Harvest Records", "response": ["* 2005 \u2013 Patrick Duff \u2013 Luxury Problems"]}, {"page": "The Blue Aeroplanes", "response": ["| Patrick Duff ||-||-||-||-||-||-||-||-||S"]}, {"page": "Talybont-on-Usk", "response": ["*Patrick Duff singer-songwriter, wrote much of the Strangelove album Love and Other Demons whilst living in a cottage just outside the village.

They released two EPs and three albums before disbanding in 1998.", "Strangelove formed in Bristol, in 1991, after David Francolini (drums, of Levitation) spotted singer Patrick Duff, who at the time was a street busker. According to Duff, Francolini's words were \"Get in the car, you're going to be a pop star.\" Francolini then got together various musicians he knew throughout the area; Alex Lee (guitar, formerly of The Blue Aeroplanes), Julian Pransky Poole (guitar, formerly part of The Jazz Butcher's band), and Joe Allen (bass guitar). With Francolini on drums, the quintet played their first gig at Bath Moles Club on 9 October 1991. Francolini took on the role of drummer for only two gigs, before being replaced by John Langley. The first song Duff wrote for Strangelove was titled \"Zoo'd Out\" in 1991, released the following year on the Volume 4 compilation, and in 1993 as part of Rough Trade's Single Club. Duff's tales of despair and sorrow struck a chord and his impressive, emotionally charged vocals were described by Tom Doyle in Q Magazine's World of Noise compilation as \"evoking thoughts of Morrissey as vocally-tutored by Scott Walker\"", "For singer Patrick Duff, internalised struggles and a heavy addiction to drugs and alcohol threatened to take his life. His battle with depression and excess were highlighted in one vaguely suicidal Melody Maker interview in 1994, and an aborted NME interview during which he kept falling asleep due to the drugs and alcohol in his system. After the second album's recording, Duff was booked into a rehabilitation clinic. He wrote about this difficult journey to getting clean for The Guardian in 1996: \"I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. My personal life was now in tatters \u2013 and I decided my last chance was to throw what was left of me into our album. Something was left in me that wanted to do something positive. Thank God.\" By this time, Nick Powell had joined the band to play keyboards, expanding their sound. A third, eponymously titled album was released 6 October 1997. Written in Bethlehem, South Wales, and recorded at Abbey Road Studio Two, this album was seen as significantly more uptempo than previous albums with Duff choosing to write less directly introspective. Songs like \u201cSuperstar\u201d and \u201cFreak\u201d, which were recorded live in the studio with minimal overdubs, set the tone.", "*Patrick Duff \u2013 vocals, guitar", "*Patrick Duff Facebook"]}, {"page": "Duff (surname)", "response": ["* Patrick Duff, British singer-songwriter "]}, {"page": "Adrian Utley", "response": ["| Patrick Duff"]}, {"page": "David Francolini", "response": ["Prior to forming Levitation, Francolini played with several bands in Bristol in the late 1980s.
