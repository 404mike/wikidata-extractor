This was about the same time as Bram Stoker began his notes for his Dracula novel. Stoker and Caine were lifetime literary friends. They shared an interest in mesmerism. Drink contains a number of similarities to Stoker's novel.  In 1906 Drink was published by George Newnes, and illustrated by expatriate Italian American illustrator and painter Cyrus Cuneo. It was described in the Manchester Guardian as 'a rather gruesome love story'. The story is of a girl who inherits a taste for alcohol from her father and is put on the road to recovery by hypnotic influence.

She was married to the American painter and illustrator Cyrus Cuneo  (18 June 187923 July 1916) and their youngest son was the English painter Terence Cuneo  RGI FGRA(1 November 19073 January 1996), known for using a mouse as his signature. ", "The 1881 census shows Tenison (age 11) as the only child at home with her parents, apparently under the care of Annie Florence Robinson (age 24), a governess. She studied at the Chiswick School of art from 18841886 and then, without the support of her family, at Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope's School of Art in South Kensington. By the time of the 1891 census, the Tenisons had moved to 215 Uxbridge Road, which was to remain the family both for Tenison's parents, and for Tenison's husband and children, Cyrus Cuneo's death in 1916.", "She then worked as a freelance illustrator, on publications like the Ludgate Magazine. By 1899 she had saved up enough money to go to Paris to study art, and she enrolled in the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi to train under Whistler, where she met Cyrus Cuneo. They returned to London to marry on in the last quarter of 1903. As Cuneo was an American citizen, Tenison ceased to be a British Subject on her marriage under the UK's 1870 Naturalisation Act.   She did not automatically gain US citizenship by marriage, as this was subject to her being eligible to naturalization (as determined by emigration officials whenever she landed in the United States, certain races and immoral persons, etc. being excluded). Thus, British women who married aliens from 1870 to 1933, when the law changed could become stateless persons. Tenison may not have been aware of this as she recorded her nationality as English in the 1911 census. After the death of her husband, Tenison applied for  naturalisation, and was re-admitted as a British subject on 27 July 1917."]}]}}
