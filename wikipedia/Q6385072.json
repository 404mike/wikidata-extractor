The next day Derbyshire defeated Glamorgan in the John Player League on the same ground. However on the Monday the ground was covered by  3 inches of snow and play was impossible.

Stevenson took his first 5 wicket innings later that season with  5-65 against Essex. In 1976 he took 5-47 against both Somerset and Lancashire and in 1977 took 7-68 against Warwickshire in 1977.In 1978 after considered transferring in the previous season, Stevenson moved to Hampshire who offered him a longer-term contract than his native Derbyshire.
