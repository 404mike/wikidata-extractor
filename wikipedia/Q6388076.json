After a decade playing in the First and Second Divisions, Mallender dropped down into non-league football to play for Hereford United; one of the leading clubs in the Southern League. In doing so, he went part-time and secured a full-time job as a sales representative for Cadbury.Mallender's first season at Edgar Street saw him play in 72 out of 79 first team matches that season, including every match of Hereford's famous cup run. In a second replay against Northampton Town, Mallender scored the most important goal of his career; an injury time equaliser which kept the cup run alive.In the 1973\u201374 season, Mallender scored his fourth and final Football League goal, in his last season for Hereford.

He later worked for Nike and settled in Hereford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hereford United 2\u20131 Newcastle United", "response": ["Tyler had another chance saved at the near post from the edge of the area, as the non-leaguers made a good start to the second half. With Newcastle on the back foot somewhat, Hereford won a corner which found Ken Mallender at the back post. However the Hereford defender saw his header rebound off the post which Alan Jones then hit just wide. At the other end Newcastle won a corner themselves with Macdonald's bullet header destined for the corner of the Hereford goal. However Potter dived across to make another great save.", "|DF ||3 || Ken Mallender"]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*First Scoring League Substitute: Ken Mallender: 25 April 1966 at Bramall Lane v Arsenal"]}]}}
