At Dungeness, Axell introduced innovations to assist in ringing birds, including special ringing pliers and mist nets.He was appointed as warden of RSPB Minsmere in 1959, where he introduced major changes in reserve management, which were in due course also adopted elsewhere. He realised that ecological succession would eventually lead to the loss of important habitats, such as bare ground on the heaths or open water in the reed beds, unless natural plant colonisation was actively prevented. He created the \"Scrape\", an area with shallow water, islands and bare mud, by lowering land levels and managing the water level with new sluices. A circular path led around the scrape, giving access to hides on each of the four sides. He retired from that post in 1977.Axell was consulted about improvements to reserves elsewhere, including major sites such as the Do\u00f1ana National Park in Andalusia; he was involved in the creation of Hong Kong's Mai Po.Bert Axell was appointed MBE in 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "RSPB Minsmere", "response": ["The RSPB had been considering the Minsmere site, at that time about  in extent, as a potential reserve from the late 1930s, and a management agreement was signed in 1947.

He attended Sutton County Grammar School, regularly visiting a sewage works in Beddington, a local birdwatching spot. Later, he would regularly cycle to Dungeness, Kent, a round trip of over 100 miles, to watch birds, falling under the influence of Bert Axell who founded Dungeness RSPB reserve in 1952. As he grew older he began to go further afield and in 1958 he was amongst the first people to spot the American northern waterthrush in St Agnes, on the Isles of Scilly."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2001", "response": ["*Bert Axell, 86, British naturalist and conservationist."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2001", "response": ["*Bert Axell, 86, British naturalist and conservationist."]}, {"page": "Axell", "response": ["* Bert Axell (1915\u20132001), British naturalist and conservationist"]}]}}
