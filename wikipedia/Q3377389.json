Considerable argument broke out as a result, with significant numbers of servicemen disputing the published version, including Admiral Reginald Bacon, who wrote his own book about the battle, criticising the version sponsored by Beatty and highly critical of Beatty's own part in the battle.Bacon, pp. 1\u2013253"]}, {"page": "John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe", "response": ["The attempt of his official biographer, Admiral Reginald Bacon, to portray him as the conqueror of the U-Boats is, in John Grigg's view, absurd, as the main decisions were taken by other men.

The Germans conducted their own Flanders offensive at the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April \u2013 15 May 1915), making the Ypres salient more costly to defend. Sir Douglas Haig succeeded Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF on 19 December. A week after his appointment, Haig met Vice-Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, who emphasised the importance of obtaining control of the Belgian coast, to end the threat posed by German U-boats. Haig was sceptical of a coastal operation, believing that a landing from the sea would be far more difficult than anticipated and that an advance along the coast would require so much preparation, that the Germans would have ample warning. Haig preferred an advance from Ypres, to bypass the flooded area around the Yser and the coast, before attempting a coastal attack to clear the coast to the Dutch border."]}, {"page": "J. F. C.

On 19 November 1908, Rear-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, the Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy, proposed the changes that he would like to make to the Neptunes design. He wanted to redistribute the armour from locations not exposed to enemy fire to those that were and to fit 21-inch (533\u00a0mm) torpedoes in lieu of the 18-inch (450\u00a0mm) weapons used in the earlier ship; the number of spare torpedoes were to be increased as well. Likely prompted by an earlier memo from Admiral Francis Bridgeman, commander-in-chief of the Home Fleet, Jellicoe wanted to eliminate the mainmast and transfer most of the functions of its spotting top to an armoured spotting tower atop the conning tower in the superstructure. The Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO), Rear-Admiral Reginald Bacon, argued that the spotting top in the foremast should be retained. Jellicoe was willing to slightly increase the new design's displacement over Neptune, but it could not cost any more, which placed major constraints on the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Philip Watts.Brooks 1995, pp. 42\u201344; Friedman 2015, pp. 111\u201312, 114"]}, {"page": "HMS Zubian", "response": ["In late 1916, two British destroyers of the 6th Flotilla in the Dover Patrol\u2014 and \u2014were badly damaged by German attacks in the English Channel.

The flotilla anchored off Zeebrugge and began their bombardment at around 05:00 on 12 May, with the monitors  and Terror concentrating on the south lock gate and her sister ship Erebus concentrating on the north gate.

The German shore battery began to return fire but ceased after four rounds due to the same poor visibility, enhanced by a British smoke screen. The British bombardment was called off at 06:00 due to a change in the wind direction clearing their smoke screen and making their ships visible from the shore. The flotilla withdrew to Dover, in the mistaken belief that their bombardment had been successful.
