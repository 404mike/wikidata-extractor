He was born in Wimbledon and educated at Tiffin School, Kingston upon Thames. There it was soon apparent that he was equally gifted as artist (which was how he would later earn his living), composer, and litterateur/wit. It was at Tiffin that he began to compose seriously and had his first composition lessons, from David Nield. He won a scholarship (1974) to read music at the Queen's College, Oxford.\nEdgley Smith's style could be diatonically tuneful, as in the Vancouver Songbook, a project of part-songs for the Vancouver Bach Children\u2019s Chorus. At other times it was highly complex and chromatic (The House of Sleep). Sometimes these extremes can be found in a single work, as in the five madrigals to poems by e e cummings (1994), which won a competition for new choral music and were later released on CD. In 2001 his setting of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Jabberwocky, commissioned by the Cheltenham Festival of Music, was premi\u00e8red by members of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. Other works have been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (Songs my Auntie Taught Me), the Fine Arts Brass Ensemble.(Fanfares for Forgotten Occasions), the Tippett Quartet (string quartet) and the composer-pianist Robert Keeley (\u00abPeople of Liberated City \u2026\u00bb).\nMark Edgley Smith had a daughter, Anna February Edgley-Smith (born 25 February 1983), and a son, Milo Henry Edgley-Smith (born 4 May 1999). He died in Cheltenham, aged 53.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wimbledon, London", "response": ["*Mark Edgley Smith (1955\u20132008), composer"]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Mark Edgley Smith || 1955 ||2008  ||  British ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Mark Smith", "response": ["*Mark Edgley Smith (1955\u20132008), British composer"]}, {"page": "Edgley", "response": ["*Mark Edgley Smith (born 1955), British composer"]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Merton", "response": ["*Mark Edgley Smith \u2013 composer"]}, {"page": "House of Sleep", "response": ["* \"The House of Sleep\", a 1983 composition by Mark Edgley Smith"]}]}}
