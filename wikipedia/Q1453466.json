Together with Peter Barlow, he also invented an afocal system to extend the focal length of telescopes, called the Barlow lens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Barlow (mathematician)", "response": ["In collaboration (1827\u20131832) with optician George Dollond, Barlow built an achromatic lens that utilized liquid carbon disulfide. (Achromatic lenses were important optical elements of improved telescopes.) In 1833, Barlow built an achromatic doublet lens of joined flint glass and crown glass. A derivative of this design, named a Barlow lens, is widely used in modern astronomy and photography as an optical element to increase both achromatism and magnification."]}, {"page": "Peter Dollond", "response": ["Dollond was born in Kensington. Working together with his father and subsequently with his younger brother and nephew (George Dollond) he successfully designed and manufactured a number of optical instruments. He is particularly credited with the invention of the triple achromatic lens - i.e., apochromatic lens - in 1763, still in wide use today,Ronald Pearsall, Collecting and Restoring Scientific Instruments, David and Charles, London 1974,  though known as the Cooke triplet after a much later 1893 patent."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| George Dollond||23/12/1819||25 January 1774 \u2013 13 May 1852"]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (G)", "response": ["*George Dollond"]}, {"page": "Dollond", "response": ["*George Dollond (1774\u20131852), English optician, nephew of Peter"]}, {"page": "Henry Lawson (astronomer)", "response": ["Living in Hereford after his 1823 marriage, he equipped an observatory with a five-foot refractor in 1826, and with one of eleven feet in 1834, made by George Dollond.
