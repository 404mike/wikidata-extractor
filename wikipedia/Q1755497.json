Much scorn was poured on the seven wonders by visitors, including Daniel Defoe, who called the moors by Chatsworth \"a waste and houling wilderness\" and scorned particularly Peak Cavern near Castleton, known as the \"Devil's Arse\". Visitor numbers did not rise until the Victorian era, when railways provided access and cultural appreciation of the Picturesque and Romantic developed. John Mawe's Mineralogy of Derbyshire (1802) and William Adam's Gem of the Peak (1843) raised interest in the area's unique geology."]}, {"page": "List of mineralogists", "response": ["*John Mawe (1764\u20131829)"]}, {"page": "James Sowerby", "response": ["*Familiar Lessons on Mineralogy and Geology (digital version), and other publications by John Mawe."]}, {"page": "Conchology", "response": ["Since 1700 a number of prominent conchologists have published their studies of shells.
