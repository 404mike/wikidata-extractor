He was captured in May 1940  in the Norwegian town of Narvik while reporting for the Daily Express.\nRomilly was the first German prisoner to be classified as Prominente, prisoners regarded by Adolf Hitler to be of great value due to their relationships to prominent Allied political figures.  Because of his importance to Hitler, Romilly was imprisoned in Oflag IV-C (Colditz Castle), from where escape was perceived to be almost impossible. Romilly lived in relative comfort with the other Prominente who would later join him at Colditz, although they were all watched 24 hours a day in case they should attempt to escape.Romilly used this position to his advantage and caused trouble by issuing complaints at every conceivable annoyance. Amongst the list, he took offence to the noise created by the boots of his guard outside his door, preventing him from sleeping. Following a visit from the Red Cross, a red carpet was placed outside his door to dull the sound.\nRomilly did successfully escape however, whilst the Prominente were being moved to \"Oflag VII-D\" Tittmoning Castle in April 1945. The camp was home to some Dutch officers amongst whom was captain Machiel van den Heuvel, \"Vandy\". Romilly and Vandy knew each other from their Colditz time where Vandy was the Dutch escape officer. Vandy was transferred to Tittmoning because of his leading role as escape officer and the Germans thought he could do no more harm in Tittmoning where most prisoners were older officers of general rank. Vandy however had his next escape plan ready and together with two Dutch officers, Romilly abseiled down the castle walls. The remainder of the Prominente hid in the castle in hopes of conveying the impression that they had all escaped. After four days they were all discovered. Romilly, in spite of the 3,000 men that were searching for him, succeeded in reaching the Allied lines.\nThis was due mainly to the gallant action of lieutenant Andre Tieleman, a Dutch officer who was fluent in German and French. With their false identity papers identifying them as French (forced) labourers they managed to escape. When interrogated by German officials, Lt Tieleman did the talking while Romilly pretended to be deaf and dumb. In this way they managed to escape into freedom.\nAfter the war Romilly returned to journalism. In 1952 he wrote the memoir The Privileged Nightmare, later reissued as Hostages at Colditz, with fellow Prominente Michael Alexander, who had earned the status by falsely claiming to be a relative of Field Marshal Harold Alexander. Romilly died in Berkeley, California in 1967 of a tranquilliser overdose. He was in the process of researching a book on the American novel at the time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colditz", "response": ["In the Nazi era, Colditz Castle was temporarily used as a concentration camp by the SA and as a Reichsarbeitsdienst camp.

He also claimed that Hitler had told him to destroy stored Red Cross supplies, stop Red Cross inspections, and block the arrival of further Red Cross supplies to the camps. Further, he asserted that Hitler had wanted more shootings of POWs and harsher punishments. According to Berger, he had quietly avoided carrying out these orders, and even countered a plan by the Luftwaffe to establish POW centres in major cities, using the POWs as human shields against air raids. Authors John Nichol and Tony Rennell observed that none of these claims have ever been independently verified, but some testimony has disputed Berger's claims. They concluded that most, if not all, of Berger's claims about his actions to assist POWs are \"unbelievable\", and noted that he did not raise any of these claims during his trial at Nuremberg after the war, or even in his autobiography. One of the few claims that has been verified to some extent is his work to protect the Prominente, a group of high-ranking or otherwise important POWs that had been held at Colditz Castle until 13 April 1945. There were a total of 21 Prominente, including Viscount Lascelles and the Master of Elphinstone, both nephews of King George VI, and Giles Romilly, a nephew of the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Berger arranged for them to be evacuated from Colditz and transported south and handed over to advancing U.S. Army troops. In doing so, Berger disobeyed a direct order from Hitler for them to be executed. This action later contributed to the shortening of his prison sentence for war crimes."]}, {"page": "List of attempts to escape Oflag IV-C", "response": ["| Giles Romilly", "| Lt. C.
