At the age of 18 Houlding became the first Briton to free climb El Capitan in the Yosemite Valley, and has gone on to climb many of its toughest lines.\nHoulding began rock climbing at the age of 10. In 1996, he became the British Junior Indoor Climbing Champion. He spent the summer of 1997 living in and around Llanberis in North Wales. The summer was notable for having many well known UK climbers in the region at the same time, including Adam Wainwright, Tim Emmett, Simon Panton, Patch Hammond and others; some important new routes were established during that season. He became the subject of the 2003 TV documentary \"My Right Foot\" which was part of the Extreme Lives series aired on BBC Television.Houlding appeared in the BBC television programme Top Gear in which he raced presenter Jeremy Clarkson up a cliff face in Verdon Gorge, winning the challenge. Houlding, joined by Tim Emmett, climbed the canyon whilst Clarkson drove an Audi RS4 to the top using the surrounding roads.  He has also appeared several times on the Audi Channel.\nHe joined the 2007 Altitude Everest Expedition, led by American climber and mountaineer, Conrad Anker, retracing the last steps of legendary British climber, George Mallory, on Mount Everest.In 2008, Houlding presented Take Me to the Edge, a British reality series on Virgin1 (later repeated on STV); and signed a deal with Ford Motor Company to become a brand ambassador for their pick up truck, the Ford Ranger.\nIn August 2009 he led a team of climbers and film makers to Mount Asgard on Baffin Island, Canada.  They attempted to free climb a 15 pitch route up the north face of the mountain to create the first free route.  Although over half of the ascent was eventually freed, the team were unable to complete the full free ascent within the available time.  Houlding and American team member Sean 'Stanley' Leary BASE jumped from the summit.  The ascent took 12 days and is featured in the 2010 film The Asgard Project.He appeared in the 2010 film The Wildest Dream along with Conrad Anker retracing the steps of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine in order to recreate their journey up Mount Everest.\nIn 2010 he completed his 10-year project \"The Prophet\", making him the first Briton to complete a new free route on the famous El Capitan in Yosemite Valley, California.\nHoulding, in a talk at Kennedy School in Hong Kong, has stated that he fell in love with rock climbing when he went climbing with his father's friend at the age of ten. He also remarked that climbing was a powerful and overwhelming experience.\nFrom December 2012 to January 2013, a team led by Houlding and including Alastair Lee, Chris Rabone, Sean Leary, Jason Pickles and David Reeves made the first ascent of a new route up the north-east ridge of Ulvetanna Peak in Antarctica. The peak was described as 'the most demanding peak on the world's toughest continent' via its fearsome north-east ridge. The film that was produced, The Last Great Climb premiered in London on 5 November 2013.\nIn 2020 Houlding's entire family reached the summit of the Piz Badile, including his seven year old daughter who climbed it unaided (the youngest ever to reach the summit), and his 3-year old son (carried on his mother's back).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Mallory", "response": ["In June 2007, as part of the 2007 Altitude Everest expedition, Conrad Anker and Leo Houlding free-climbed the Second Step, having first removed the Chinese ladder (which was later replaced). Houlding rated the climb at 5.9, just within Mallory's estimated capabilities. The climb was part of an expedition which tried to recreate the 1924 climb. Eight years earlier, Anker had climbed the Second Step as part of the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, but had used one point of aid by stepping on a rung of the ladder, which blocked the only available foothold. At that time, he had rated the climb at 5.10, which he considered to be beyond Mallory's capabilities, but after the June 2007 climb, he changed his view and said that he \"could have climbed it\".", "Mallory was captured on film by expedition cameraman John Noel, who released his film of the 1924 expedition, The Epic of Everest.IMDB listing for John Noel's Epic of Everest Some of his footage was also used in George Lowe's 1953 documentary The Conquest of Everest.
