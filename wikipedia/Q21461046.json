The great-great granddaughter of the surgeon William Marsden, she trained in art schools of London before earning employment sketching portraits of motion picture personalities. Sandwith hitchhiked the Birdsville Track from August 1952 to February 1953 and sketched its people before travelling to the South Pacific. In 1954, she was the first person to produce a portrait of S\u0101lote Tupou III, Queen of Tonga.
