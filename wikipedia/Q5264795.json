Burckhardt understood Renaissance as drawing together art, philosophy and politics, and made the case that it created \"modern man\". Burckhardt developed an ambivalent interpretation of modernity and the effects of the Renaissance, praising the movement as introducing new forms of cultural and religious freedom but also worrying about the potential feelings of alienation and disenchantment modern men might feel.  These claims proved quite controversial, but the scholarly judgements of Burckhardt's History of the Renaissance are sometimes considered to be justified by subsequent research, according to historians including Desmond Seward and art historians such as Kenneth Clark. Burckhardt and the German historian Georg Voigt founded the historical study of the Renaissance. In contrast to Voigt, who confined his studies to early Italian humanism, Burckhardt dealt with all aspects of Renaissance society."]}, {"page": "Whip", "response": ["In Victorian literature cads and bounders are depicted as being horsewhipped or threatened with horsewhipping for seduction of young women or breach of promise (to marry), usually by her brothers or father. Examples are found in the works of Benjamin Disraeli and Anthony Trollope who includes such a scene in Doctor Thorne. It is also mentioned, though not depicted, in comic novels by Evelyn Waugh and P.G. Wodehouse. As late as the 1970s the historian Desmond Seward was reported by the Daily Telegraph to have been threatened with horsewhipping for besmirching the reputation of Richard III in a biography."]}, {"page": "Isabeau of Bavaria", "response": ["Charles VI died in October 1422. As Henry V had died earlier the same year, his infant son by Catherine, Henry\u00a0VI, was proclaimed King of France, according to the terms of the Treaty of Troyes, with the Duke of Bedford acting as regent. Rumors circulated about Isabeau again; some chronicles describe her living in a \"degraded state\". According to Tuchman, Isabeau had a farmhouse built in St. Ouen where she looked after livestock, and in her later years, during a lucid episode, Charles arrested one of her lovers whom he tortured, then drowned in the Seine.Tuchman (1978), 516 Desmond Seward writes it was the disinherited Dauphin who had the man killed. Described as a former lover of Isabeau as well as a \"poisoner and wife-murderer\", Charles kept him as a favorite at his court until ordering his drowning.Seward (1978), 214"]}, {"page": "Battle of Castillon", "response": ["The French army was commanded by committee; Charles VII's ordnance officer, Jean Bureau laid out the camp to maximize French artillery strength. In a defensive setup, Bureau's forces built an artillery park out of range from Castillon's guns. According to Desmond Seward, the park \"consisted of a deep trench with a wall of earth behind it which was strengthened by tree-trunks; its most remarkable feature was the irregular, wavy line of the ditch and earthwork, which enabled the guns to enfilade any attackers\".Seward 1978, pp. 259\u201360 The park included up to 300 guns of various sizes, and was protected by a ditch and palisade on three sides and a steep bank of the River Lidoire on the fourth."]}, {"page": "Philip Ziegler", "response": ["*Brooks's: A Social History (1991) editor with Desmond Seward"]}, {"page": "Battle of Verneuil", "response": ["The head-on clash between the superbly armoured English and Franco-Scottish men-at-arms on the field of Verneuil, both of whom had marched on foot into battle, resulted, in the words of the British medievalist Desmond Seward, in \"a hand-to-hand combat whose ferocity astounded even contemporaries\". Wavrin recalled how \"the blood of the dead spread on the field and that of the wounded ran in great streams all over the earth\". For about three-quarters of an hour, Frenchmen, Scotsmen and Englishmen stabbed, hacked and cut each other down on the field of Verneuil without either side gaining any advantage in what is often considered to be one of the most fiercely fought battles of the entire war. Bedford himself fought in the battle, wielding a fearsome two-handed poleaxe, leading one veteran to recall: \"He reached no one whom he did not fell\". Seward noted that Bedford's poleaxe \"smashed open an expensive armour like a modern tin can, the body underneath being crushed and mangled before even the blade sank in\"."]}, {"page": "Richard III (biography)", "response": ["Historical writers Desmond Seward and Alison Weir, both hostile to Richard, disagree; Seward refers to Kendall as Richard III's \"romantic apologist,\",Desmond Seward, The Wars of the Roses, New York: Penguin (1995), p. 261 superseded by Charles Ross's 1981 biography.

He was described by his contemporaries as \"a very fat, extremely boring, overwhelmingly ambitious arriviste. His conversations were hideously detailed and humourless\". He was responsible, apparently through spite, for preventing Powell's promotion to the rank of major. When the historian Desmond Seward proposed Capel-Dunn as the original Widmerpool, Powell replied that he \"might be on to something\".  Denis Capel-Dunn married overseas (Cuba) Elizabeth Hessey (daughter of Brigadier William Francis Hessey) and their first daughter Hester Capel-Dunn married the brother of actor Laurence Olivier - Gerard Dacres Olivier; the caricature may well be a red herring."]}, {"page": "Arkana Publishing", "response": ["| The Monks of War: The Military Religious Orders || Desmond Seward || 1995 || "]}, {"page": "The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy", "response": ["Its scholarly judgements are considered to have been largely justified by subsequent research according to historians including Desmond Seward and art historians such as Kenneth Clark."]}, {"page": "Bal des Ardents", "response": ["The King's sudden onset of insanity was seen by some as a sign of divine anger and punishment and by others as the result of sorcery; modern historians such as Knecht speculate that Charles might have been experiencing the onset of paranoid schizophrenia.

As part of this they fought not only in Ireland, but also in England during the Wars of the Roses and in France during the Hundred Years' War. In his work on the Hundred Years' War, Desmond Seward mentions that the Earl of Ormond had raised Irish kern and Gallowglass to fight for Henry V Plantagenet, King of England, where they were present at the 1418 Siege of Rouen."]}, {"page": "Seward, Desmond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Desmond Seward "]}]}}
