John Balance and Peter \"Sleazy\" Christopherson founded Coil in 1982 in London, England, after collaborating on a few side projects and following their departure from Psychic TV.   Other collaborators, such as Drew McDowall and Danny Hyde, would frequently record with the band, some becoming members for a time.  By the time Coil arrived at Nothing Records, they had released three studio albums.   Scatology and Horse Rotorvator were released on Force & Form, which was manufactured and distributed by K.422, a sister label of Some Bizzare Records.  Love's Secret Domain was released on Torso in Europe and the seminal Wax Trax! Records in the United States.

Coil would also do remixes for the Nine Inch Nails releases Closer to God (alongside fellow Nothing Records label-mates Meat Beat Manifesto) and Further Down the Spiral.

With the Torso demo material already completed, the band decided to head into Reznor's Nothing Studios in New Orleans to re-record the material, as well as write new music.  Recording at Nothing Studios began in June 1995 and was completed by January of 1997.  Trent Reznor did not perform, produce or write any material for it. John Balance recalled, \"We produced it ourselves, with Danny Hyde as engineer and with excellent help, complete co-operation and enormous investment of time, energy and genuine enthusiasm from all the people at Hot Snakes studio (a.k.a. Nothing Studios).  In particular Chris Vrenna, who helped us iron out technical stuff, Brian the studio manager, who kept it running smoothly, and of course Trent himself, who kept out of our way while letting us loose in his secret domain.\"", "In 2005, Coil announced the release of The Ape of Naples on their own Threshold House label.

The band also included a thank you to Trent Reznor and Nothing Records in the liner notes.  In 2007, Important Records reissued The Ape Of Naples on LP, alongside a companion album of material, called The New Backwards.
