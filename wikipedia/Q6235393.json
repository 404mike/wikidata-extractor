Kocher then proceeded to start a journey through Europe to meet several of the most famous surgeons of the time. It is not clear how Kocher financed his trip but according to Bonjour (1981) he received money from an unknown female Suisse romande philanthropist who also supported his friend Marc Dufour and was probably a member of the Moravian Church. In October 1865, he traveled to Berlin, passing through Leipzig and visiting an old friend from high school, Hans Blum. In Berlin, he studied under Bernhard von Langenbeck and applied for an assistant position with Langenbeck and Rudolf Virchow. Since there was no position available, in April 1867 Kocher moved on to London where he first met Jonathan Hutchinson and then worked for Henry Thompson and John Erichsen. Furthermore, he was interested in the work of Isaac Baker Brown and Thomas Spencer Wells, who also invited Kocher to go to the opera with his family. In July 1867, he traveled on to Paris to meet Auguste N\u00e9laton, Auguste Verneuil and Louis Pasteur. During his travels, he did not only learn novel techniques but also got to know leading surgeons in person and learned to speak English fluently which allowed him later on to follow the scientific progress in the English speaking world with ease."]}, {"page": "Royal College of Surgeons of England", "response": ["| Thomas Spencer Wells || 1882"]}, {"page": "Brompton Cemetery", "response": ["* Sir Thomas Spencer Wells \u2013 surgeon to Queen Victoria, medical professor and president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England"]}, {"page": "St George's Hospital", "response": ["* Thomas Spencer Wells, pioneer in abdominal surgery"]}, {"page": "Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland", "response": ["* Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, Thomas Henry Huxley, James Paget, Thomas Spencer Wells (1886)"]}, {"page": "Sir Thomas Spencer Wells", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Spencer Wells"]}, {"page": "St Albans School, Hertfordshire", "response": ["* Thomas Spencer Wells (1818\u20131897), surgeon"]}, {"page": "Thomas Wells", "response": ["* Thomas Spencer Wells (1818\u20131897), surgeon to Queen Victoria"]}, {"page": "Wells baronets", "response": ["The Wells Baronetcy, of Upper Grosvenor Street in the County of London, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 11 May 1883 for the prominent surgeon Thomas Spencer Wells.

Surgeons like Charles Clay (1801\u20131893) in Manchester and Thomas Spencer Wells (1818-1897) in London began to perform the procedure regularly, but the mortality rate was so high that mainstream medical opinion felt that it was too dangerous to perform.
