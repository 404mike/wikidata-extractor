He holds the record for most appearances in the Scottish Football League, and is one of the top ten goalscorers. He was captain of the side that won Motherwell's only league championship to date, in 1931\u201332, besides playing in two Scottish Cup finals (1931 and 1933, both lost to Celtic). Ferrier represented the Scottish League XI in seven inter-league matches, scoring five goals. After retiring as a player in 1937, he was the Motherwell assistant manager and later managed Airdrieonians and Ayr United.In October 2021, 104 years after first signing on at Fir Park, it was announced that Ferrier was to be inducted into the Motherwell F.C.

Despite this handicap, the Scottish League team performed quite well before the fixtures were stopped in 1915 due to the First World War. The league itself continued during the conflict, unlike others in the UK, and three end-of-season fundraising friendly matches were played between the select team and Celtic, the Scottish champions in each of the seasons.Association Football: Belgian Refugees' Fund, The Glasgow Herald, 17 May 19151916-05-20: Scottish League XI 1-0 Celtic XI, Friendly, The Celtic Wiki / Rest of the League, 1; Celtic, 0 Glasgow Herald, 22 May 1916 (via Partick Thistle History Archive)Football's Exit, The Glasgow Herald, 28 May 1917 / 1917-05-26: Rest of the League 2-1 Celtic, Friendly, The Celtic Wiki At the end of the war, the Scottish Football League was badly affected by the decline of heavy industry in the country, which meant that only the Old Firm clubs and Motherwell were able to retain a high standard of player. To improve the standard of the Scottish League team, two notable English-born players were selected, Bob Ferrier of Motherwell and J. B. McAlpine of Queen's Park as well as Donegal-born Patsy Gallacher. Their birthplace meant that they were ineligible to play for the national team, but they were educated and played all of their senior football in Scotland. Despite these efforts, the Scottish League team suffered heavy defeats against the Football League in 1928 (6\u20132) and 1930 (7\u20133)."]}, {"page": "1932\u201333 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|OL ||||Bob Ferrier"]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|OL ||||Bob Ferrier"]}, {"page": "Robert Ferrier", "response": ["Robert or Bob Ferrier may refer to:", "*Bob Ferrier (English footballer), played for Motherwell F.C.", "*Bob Ferrier (Scottish footballer) (1874\u20131947), played for Sheffield Wednesday F.C."]}]}}
