She is a Reader in Fine Art at the University of Ulster at Belfast. Her work has been exhibited at international exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale, 2005.Between 2000 and 2004 McIntyre's work focused on interior spaces that had been forgotten and overlooked, her images conveying the atmospheres that resonated from the institutional spaces she photographed. From 2005 onwards McIntyre shifted the focus of her work to the subject of landscape. Her imagery explores the relationship between landscape painting and photography. Her current work examines the sublime and picturesque in 18th-century European landscape painting.In her more recent work McIntyre has incorporated installation, using large-scale 3-d forms to accompany the exhibition of her photography.Mary McIntyre is also founder of independent record label, TONN Recordings, which specialises in electronic music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "McIntyre", "response": ["* Mary McIntyre, Northern Irish photographer", "* Mary McIntyre (artist) (born 1928), New Zealand artist"]}, {"page": "Peter Richards (artist)", "response": ["When Richards began his professional career in Belfast in the mid-1990s he was working both as an artist and as a curator.
