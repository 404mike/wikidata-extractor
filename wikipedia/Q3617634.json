Hally shared the writing of scripts with fellow Scottish playwright and script writer, Ann Marie Di Mambro.  The scripts were written in English before being translated into Gaelic. The show was anticipated with derision by a sceptical press, but after the first episode was broadcast during peak viewing time, Kenneth Roy, television critic of Scotland on Sunday, described it as 'a credit to the company (Scottish Television) and a smack in the face to those of us who were doubtful' and after a few episodes he revised his opinion, saying 'it is even better than it looked at first glance quite simply the best thing to have happened to television in Scotland for a long time'."]}, {"page": "Ann Marie di Mambro", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ann Marie Di Mambro"]}]}}
