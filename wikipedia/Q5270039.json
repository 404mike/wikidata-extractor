Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith did not wish to abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: \"It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away\u00a0... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements\u00a0... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished.\" Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches."]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Di Jones||  || Full back || 1898\u20131902||118||1|| ||"]}, {"page": "Lot Jones", "response": ["Jones was born in Chirk, Denbighshire and was the son of Elizabeth Jones (1864\u2013)Baptism Register, Trefonen Parish Church, page 18 and grandson of Lot Jones (1831\u2013), a coal minerBritish Census 1881 RG11; Piece: 2661; Folio: 85; Page: 18; GSU roll: 1341639. and labourer.British Census 1891 RG12; Piece: 2118; Folio: 176; Page: 27; GSU roll: 6097228.
