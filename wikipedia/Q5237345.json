The statue commemorates Churchill's role as the member for the parliamentary constituency of Woodford. Churchill was elected to the Epping seat in 1924 and held it until 1945 when the new constituency of Woodford was created. Churchill then held this seat until his retirement in 1964. The statue  is a Grade II listed structure.", "In 1958, the Sir Winston Churchhill Commemoration Fund commissioned David McFall (1919\u20131988) to sculpt a statue of Churchill to be placed in the Woodford constituency. McFall had previously trained under Eric Gill and then collaborated with Jacob Epstein. McFall worked initially from photographs, before Churchill allowed a number of personal sittings at Chartwell, his country home in Kent. The sittings, after which McFall produced six busts of Churchill in addition to the Woodford statue, were the last Churchill ever permitted. The statue was unveiled by Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, , on 30 October 1959. Churchill attended the ceremony and made a short speech focused on the gradual dissolution of the British Empire and on Britain's own future place in the world. The statue was one of only two of Churchill completed and unveiled in his lifetime.", "Initial reactions to photographs of the work in progress were unfavourable, including those of members of Churchill's own family. Clementine Churchill, a fierce defender of her husband's reputation and public image, wrote to McFall suggesting that the face was \"a caricature of Winston\" and requesting changes. McFall made alterations, and Lady Churchilll adjusted her opinion (see box). The reaction at the unveiling, and subsequently, was more positive; Path\u00e9 News reported in its contemporary account that \"the essence of Sir Winston is caught in the brilliant sculpture by David McFall\". Churchill's own comment on the statue at the unveiling ceremony was, \"very nice\". Historic England describes the statue as a \"highly regarded, purposeful, yet sympathetic sculptural representation of Britain's iconic war-time Prime Minister in his later years\"."]}]}}
