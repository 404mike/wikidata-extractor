In his early twenties he emerged as a central figure in the Manchester School of post-war British composers. In 1955\u201356 he joined Olivier Messiaen's masterclass in Paris. Although in the early sixties Goehr was considered a leader of the avant-garde, his oblique attitude to modernism\u2014and to any movement or school whatsoever\u2014soon became evident. In a sequence of works including the Piano Trio (1966), the opera Arden Must Die (1966), the music-theatre piece Triptych (1968\u201370), the orchestral Metamorphosis/Dance (1974), and the String Quartet No. 3 (1975\u201376), Goehr's personal voice was revealed, arising from a highly individual use of the serial method and a fusion of elements from his double heritage of Schoenberg and Messiaen. Since the luminous 'white-note' Psalm IV setting of 1976, Goehr has urged a return to more traditional ways of composing, using familiar materials as objects of musical speculation, in contrast to the technological priorities of much present-day musical research.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 10", "response": ["*1932 \u2013 Alexander Goehr, English composer and academic"]}, {"page": "Claudio Monteverdi", "response": ["Rinuccini's full libretto, which has survived, was set in modern times by Alexander Goehr (Arianna, 1995), including a version of Monteverdi's Lament.Sutcliffe (1995), pp. 610\u201311"]}, {"page": "Manchester", "response": ["Manchester has two symphony orchestras, the Hall\u00e9 and the BBC Philharmonic, and a chamber orchestra, the Manchester Camerata.
