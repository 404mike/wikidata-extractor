When renting the house, Hollick agreed with his landlord that he would be recording a \"four piece noisy rock band in the front room\". During sessions, Watts, singer Jack Sharp and bassist Dan Davies camped outside the house so their equipment, including vintage guitars and amplifiers, could be stored inside. The band experimented with complex song structures, while Sharp performed \"exhaustive research\" when writing his lyrics, citing the \"sense [of] depth\" evident in Richard Thompson's songs because of the research the ex-Fairport Convention guitarist carries out, as an inspiration. The track \"When the Fire Is Dead in the Grate\" was influenced by the \"seaside folk superstition\" Sharp read in David Thomson's 1954 book, The People of the Sea.
