Amongst his supporters was William Sharp, the engraver. Some of his political predictions (such as the violent death of Louis XVI) seemed to be proof that he was inspired. But when Brothers predicted that, on 19 November 1795 he would be revealed as Prince of the Hebrews and Ruler of the world, and the date passed without any such manifestation, Sharp deserted him to become a religious follower of Joanna Southcott. His followers tended to drift away either disillusioned or embarrassed."]}, {"page": "William Sharp", "response": ["William Sharp may refer to:", "* William Sharp (engraver) (1749\u20131824), English engraver", "* William Sharp (lithographer) (1803\u20131875), English-born lithographer and painter; lived in Boston, Massachusetts", "* William Sharp (writer) (1855\u20131905), Scottish author and poet, pseudonym Fiona MacLeod", "* William Sharp (Australian politician) (1844\u20131929), New South Wales politician", "* William Sharp (homeopath) (1805\u20131896), English early science educator and homeopath", "* William Sharp (surgeon) (1729\u20131810), surgeon to George III and musician", "* William Sharp (scientist) (born 1936), American scientist and entrepreneur", "* William Sharp (footballer) (1889\u20131915), Scottish footballer", "* Sir William Sharp, 6th Baronet (1729\u20131780), Scottish soldier of fortune", "* Michael William Sharp (1776\u20131840), English painter", "* William Sharp Bush (1786\u20131812), U.S. marine", "* William Sharp Macleay (1792\u20131865), British entomologist", "* William Sharp McKechnie (1863\u20131930), Scottish lecturer and author", "* William Sharpe (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "1824 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 25 July \u2013 William Sharp, engraver (born 1749)"]}, {"page": "1749 in Great Britain", "response": ["* 29 January \u2013 William Sharp, engraver (died 1824)"]}, {"page": "Sharp (surname)", "response": ["* William Sharp (engraver) (1749\u20131824), English engraver", "* William Sharp (writer) (1855\u20131905), Scottish author and poet, pseudonym Fiona MacLeod"]}, {"page": "William Armfield Hobday", "response": ["Throughout his chequered career Hobday was a constant exhibitor at the Royal Academy, frequently contributing even during his residence at Bristol. In 1819 he exhibited there a portrait of the Duke of Sussex. His best work was a picture of Carolus the Hermit of Tong - whereabouts presently unknown. His portrait of Miss Biggs in the character of Cora, and that of Richard Reynolds, the Bristol Quaker philanthropist, were engraved, the latter by William Sharp. He was always well patronised, and obtained good prices for his works, but the quality of his art suffered greatly from his restless and improvident habits."]}, {"page": "Robert Hindmarsh", "response": ["In January 1784 they formed \"The Theosophical Society\", for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg.

Hindmarsh printed for this society Swedenborg's Apocalypsis Explicata (1785\u20131789), and in 1786 he issued his own abridgment of Bourignon's Light of the World. A proposal made on 19 April 1787 to open a place of worship was defeated by John Clowes, who came from Manchester to oppose it. However, on 31 July sixteen worshippers met at the house of Thomas Wright, a watchmaker, in the Poultry.

At that time forgery of Bank of England notes was common, and Tilloch in 1790 laid before the British ministry a mode of printing which would render forgery impossible. Receiving no encouragement, he brought his process before the notice of the Commission d'Assignats of the Legislative Assembly, at Paris, but then came the outbreak of war. In 1797 he submitted to the Bank of England a specimen of a note engraved after his plan, accompanied by a certificate signed by Francesco Bartolozzi, Wilson Lowry, William Sharp and other engravers, to the effect that they did not believe it could be copied by any of the known arts of engraving. He could not, however, persuade the authorities to accept it, though in 1810 they adopted the process of Augustus Applegath, which Tilloch claimed in 1820, in a petition to parliament, to be virtually his own."]}, {"page": "William Skelton", "response": ["He was born in London on 14 June 1763, the brother of the engraver Joseph Skelton.

In 1768, troubles in the Incorporated Society of Artists, of which Strange was a member, led to the foundation of the Royal Academy. Strange opposed those breaking away, and he came to believe that the exclusion from the Academy of engravers was levelled against himself. His rival Francesco Bartolozzi was elected, ostensibly as a painter. With other engravers (William Sharp, John Hall, and William Woollett), Strange declined associate membership. In 1775 he published on  his grievances in An Inquiry into the Rise and Establishment of the Royal Academy of Arts. He then took his family over to Paris, where they remained in the Rue d'Enfer until 1780.", "Technically, Strange habitually employed drypoint, and was followed by Raffaele Morghen, William Woollett, and William Sharp. He disliked the stipple engraving of Bartolozzi. He planned a series of 50 of his major works as legacy, from early in his career. Eighty sets of selected impressions of these were bound in atlas folio, with a dedication to the king (composed mainly by Blair), and published in 1790, with a portrait after Jean-Baptiste Greuze, and an introduction describing the progress of engraving. Apart from Van Dyck, he chose mainly Italian masters."]}]}}
