The group included Michael Kidner, Gillian Wise (1936\u2013), Peter Lowe (1938\u2013), Colin Jones (1934\u2013), David Saunders (1936\u2013), Jean Spencer (1942\u20131998), Richard Allen (1933\u201399), John Ernest (1922\u20131994) and others. The group arose through an exhibition of nine artists, \"Systeemi-System\", organised by Steele and his then wife, the textile designer Arja Nenonen (1936\u20132011), at the Amos Anderson Museum in Helsinki, capital of Nenonen's native Finland, in 1969. The exhibition was subtitled by Steele \"An Exhibition of Syntactic Art from Britain\", the word \"syntactic\" referring to the work \"being constructed from a vocabulary of largely geometric forms in accordance with pre-determined and often mathematically-based systems\". The Helsinki show was followed by a similar one called \"Matrix\" at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol and the 1972/3 Arts Council touring exhibition \"Systems\" which opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London in March 1972. This was followed by \"Systems II\" at the Polytechnic of Central London in 1973. Individual members showed at the Lucy Milton gallery in Notting Hill, London, up to 1975, and in continental Europe during the 1970s and afterwards. The group ceased to exist in 1976 following political disagreements, but a number of its members remained on friendly terms and exhibited together.Fowler, \"Constructive and Systems Art in Britain after the Second World War\", in the catalogue for \"Elements of Abstraction: Space Space, Line & Interval in Modern British Art\", at Southampton City Art Gallery, September 2005."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 1999", "response": ["*Richard Allen, 66, British abstract artist and printmaker."]}]}}
