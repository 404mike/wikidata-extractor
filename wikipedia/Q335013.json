After serving in the Mahdist War and then the response to the Boxer Rebellion, he commanded the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, a tactically indecisive engagement after which his aggressive approach was contrasted with the caution of his commander Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. He is remembered for his comment at Jutland that \"There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today\", after two of his ships exploded. Later in the war he succeeded Jellicoe as Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, in which capacity he received the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet at the end of the war. He then followed Jellicoe's path a second time, serving as First Sea Lord\u2014a position that Beatty held longer (7 years 9 months) than any other First Sea Lord.  While First Sea Lord, he was involved in negotiating the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 in which it was agreed that the United States, Britain and Japan should set their navies in a ratio of 5:5:3, with France and Italy maintaining smaller ratio fleets of 1.75 each.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 17", "response": ["*1871 \u2013 David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty, English admiral (d. 1936)"]}, {"page": "1936", "response": ["* March 11 \u2013 David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty, British admiral (b. 1871)"]}, {"page": "1871", "response": ["** David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty, British admiral (d. 1936)"]}, {"page": "Nantwich", "response": ["*David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty (1871 in Stapeley \u2013 1936), Admiral of the Fleet"]}]}}
