He was then signed by Jock Stein to play for Hibernian in April 1964, but Stein himself moved in the opposite direction early in the next year. McNamee signed for Newcastle United in December 1966, and was part of the team that won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.After leaving Newcastle in 1971, McNamee played for Blackburn Rovers, Hartlepool United, Lancaster City and Workington (serving as player-manager of the latter) before retiring in 1976.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jock Stein", "response": ["Stein was appointed manager of Hibernian in March 1964. Although Hibs had a bigger support base than Dunfermline and had enjoyed success in the 1950s, the club was struggling. Hibs had narrowly avoided relegation in 1963 and were sitting in 12th place when Stein was appointed. The players noticed an immediate difference from previous managers as Stein took an active part in practice sessions. Stein built his defence around John McNamee, who had been discarded by Celtic, and Pat Stanton. In midfield he had Pat Quinn and Willie Hamilton, who were talented players but had under-achieved. Hamilton had problems with drinking and gambling, but he produced his best performances under Stein's guidance. Stein led Hibs to victory in the Summer Cup, their first trophy in ten years. Neil Martin scored regularly and was capped for Scotland under Stein."]}, {"page": "Workington A.F.C.", "response": ["*John McNamee\u00a0\u2013 Jun 1975 to Dec 1975"]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|John McNamee||||CB||1966\u20131971||117||8||"]}, {"page": "1962\u201363 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|RH |||| John McNamee", "|RH |||| John McNamee"]}, {"page": "Walter Galbraith", "response": ["Hibs just avoided relegation in both seasons that Galbraith managed the club, but he introduced Pat Stanton into the team and signed players such as Neil Martin, Pat Quinn, John Parke and Willie Hamilton.
