He is the Principal Investigator of the distributed computing project Climateprediction.net (which makes use of computing resources provided voluntarily by the general public), and was principally responsible for starting this project. He is Professor of Geosystem Science in the\n\nSchool of Geography and the Environment, and a Fellow of Linacre College, Oxford.Allen has worked at the Energy Unit of the United Nations Environment Programme, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nHe contributed to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a Lead Author of the Chapter on detection of change and attribution of causes, and was a Review Editor for the chapter on predictions of global climate change for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and a co-author of the IPCC October 8, 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 \u00b0C.  His research focuses on the attribution of recent climate change and assessing what these changes mean for global climate simulations of the future.In 2010, Allen was awarded the Edward Appleton Medal and Prize by the Institute of Physics for \"his important contributions to the detection and attribution of human influence on climate and quantifying uncertainty in climate predictions\".Allen also provided the technical expertise for the game Fate of the World, which is \"a PC strategy game that simulates the real social and environmental impact of global climate change over the next 200 years\".In 2015, he mentioned that carbon capture and storage (CCS) should be made mandatory.Allen was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to climate change attribution and predicition and net-zero.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Climateprediction.net", "response": ["Myles Allen first thought about the need for large climate ensembles in 1997, but was only introduced to the success of SETI@home in 1999.
