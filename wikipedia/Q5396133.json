One by Roger Clifft and Erwin Gabathuler and one by Friedhelm Brasse and Joerg Gayler. The two teams came together to design a high intensity muon beam of energy up to 280 GeV to do the experiments. The collaboration, which became known as the European Muon Collaboration (EMC), was formed around these people to carry out the experiments.  A proposal for the beam and an apparatus to do the experiments was submitted to CERN in 1974 (the White Book). The experiments were approved and the apparatus was built between the years 1974\u201378. The collaboration grew in size to about 100 physicists. This was among the largest experimental collaborations at the time."]}, {"page": "List of Queen's University Belfast people", "response": ["* Erwin Gabathuler - particle physicist"]}, {"page": "Rainey Endowed School", "response": ["*Erwin Gabathuler, nuclear physicist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| Erwin Gabathuler||15/03/1990|| Nuclear Physicist"]}, {"page": "2001 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Professor Erwin Gabathuler, F.R.S.
