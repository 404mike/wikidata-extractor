Conjuring up a modern Trojan Horse, kriegies (prisoners) constructed a gymnastic vaulting horse largely from plywood from Red Cross parcels. The horse was designed to conceal men, tools and containers of soil. Each day the horse was carried out to the same spot near the perimeter fence and while prisoners conducted gymnastic exercises above, a tunnel was dug. At the end of each working day, a wooden board was placed over the tunnel entrance and covered with surface soil. The gymnastics disguised the real purpose of the vaulting horse and kept the sound of the digging from being detected by the microphones. For three months three prisoners, Lieutenant Michael Codner, Flight Lieutenant Eric Williams and Flight Lieutenant Oliver Philpot, in shifts of one or two diggers at a time, dug over  of tunnel, using bowls as shovels and metal rods to poke through the surface of the ground to create air holes. No shoring was used except near the entrance. On the evening of 19 October 1943, Codner, Williams and Philpot made their escape.AIR40/2645 Part I \u2013 Official Camp History \u2013 SLIII(E) Williams and Codner were able to reach the port of Stettin where they stowed away on a Danish ship and eventually returned to Britain. Philpot, posing as a Norwegian margarine manufacturer, was able to board a train to Danzig (now Gda\u0144sk) and from there stowed away on a Swedish ship headed for Stockholm, from where he was repatriated to Britain. Accounts of this escape were recorded in the book Goon in the Block (later retitled The Wooden Horse) by Williams, the book Stolen Journey by Philpot and the 1950 film The Wooden Horse.", "Eric Williams was a navigator on a downed bomber who was held at Stalag Luft III. After the war, on the long sea voyage home, Williams wrote Goon in the Block, a short book based on his experience. Four years later, in 1949, he rewrote it as a longer third-person narrative under the title The Wooden Horse, which was filmed as The Wooden Horse in 1950. He included many details omitted in his first book, but changed his name to \"Peter Howard\", Michael Codner to \"John Clinton\" and Oliver Philpot to \"Philip Rowe\". Williams also wrote a prequel, The Tunnel, an extended study of the mentalities of life as a prisoner of war.

Tunnelling in particular was made harder: the perimeter fence was placed some distance from the huts, necessitating longer tunnels; the soil changed colour markedly when dry, making disposal of freshly dug tunnel soil difficult; and the Germans employed seismographs to detect vibration caused by digging. Pondering the story of the Trojan Horse, Michael Codner developed the idea of employing a wooden vaulting horse in order to escape from Stalag Luft III. He approached Williams and they developed the idea together. They approached a third prisoner, Flight Lieutenant Oliver Philpot, in June 1943 to \"register\" their escape scheme with the escape committee, as Philpot was the escape co-ordinator for the hut in which the three of them lived. The scheme was approved and so, using bowls for shovels, Codner, Williams and Philpot dug for three months whilst the other camp inmates vaulted continuously over the wooden horse in order to mask the vibration from the tunnelling work. Sand was carried back inside the horse and dried in the attic of the camp canteen before being distributed in the compound.Oliver Philpot, Stolen Journey, London, 1950, "]}, {"page": "Philpot, Oliver", "response": ["#redirectOliver Philpot"]}, {"page": "Stolen Journey", "response": ["#REDIRECTOliver Philpot"]}, {"page": "Anthony Bridgman", "response": ["In October of that year he was a significant participant in the famous Wooden Horse escape plan for which a gymnastic vaulting horse, ostensibly to promote exercise for camp members, was used to conceal men and tools tasked with tunneling.
