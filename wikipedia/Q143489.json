He was the first manager of Celtic Football Club, and one of the most successful managers in Scottish football history. During his managerial tenure, Maley led Celtic to thirty major trophies (16 league championships and 14 Scottish Cups) in forty-three consecutive years as manager. He is attributed to have coined the famous Celtic motto 'It is not his creed nor his nationality which counts, it's the man himself.'", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1868", "response": ["** Willie Maley, Scottish football player and manager (d. 1958)"]}, {"page": "1958", "response": ["** Willie Maley, Scottish football player and manager (born 1868)"]}, {"page": "Celtic F.C.", "response": ["In 1897, the club became a private limited company and Willie Maley was appointed as the first 'secretary-manager'. Between 1905 and 1910, Celtic won the Scottish League Championship six times in a row. They also won the Scottish Cup in both 1907 and 1908, the first times a Scottish club had ever won the double. During World War I, Celtic won the league four times in a row, including 62 matches unbeaten between November 1915 and April 1917. The mid-1920s saw the emergence of Jimmy McGrory as one of the most prolific goalscorers in British football history; over a sixteen-year playing career, he scored 550 goals in 547 games (including 16 goals for Clydebank during a season on loan in 1923\u201324), a British goal-scoring record to this day. In January 1940, Willie Maley's retirement was announced. He was 71 years old and had served the club in varying roles for nearly 52 years, initially as a player and then as secretary-manager. Jimmy McStay became manager of the club in February 1940. He spent over five years in this role, although due to the Second World War no official competitive league football took place during this time. The Scottish Football League and Scottish Cup were suspended and in their place regional league competitions were set up.Rangers dominated wartime football but should their titles be recognised in the record books?, The Scotsman, 21 March 2020 Celtic did not do particularly well during the war years, but did win the Victory in Europe Cup held in May 1945 as a one-off football match to celebrate Victory in Europe Day.", "| Willie Maley || 1897\u20131940", "* Willie Maley"]}, {"page": "Old Firm", "response": ["*Willie Maley and Tom Maley (Celtic)6-1 Vs Rangers, Glasgow Cup (27/10/1888) , Rangers FitbaStats", "|align=left|Willie Maley"]}, {"page": "Newry", "response": ["*Willie Maley (1868 \u2013 1958), football manager"]}, {"page": "Herbert Chapman", "response": ["Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as he managed to bargain the inebriated Bolton directors down to \u00a310,890. He was less successful in his attempt to sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory were on their way to a pilgrimage in Lourdes.Cairney, pp. 26\u201328 A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record."]}, {"page": "Jock Stein", "response": ["In July 1957, Stein was given the job of coaching the Celtic reserve team. His squad included a number of young players who would later play under him in the first team, including Billy McNeill, Bobby Murdoch and John Clark. In his first season as a coach, Stein won the Reserve Cup with an 8\u20132 aggregate triumph over Rangers. Despite this success, according to football journalist Archie MacPherson, Stein was told by club chairman Robert Kelly he would not progress further at Celtic due to his Protestant faith; Celtic had only previously appointed Catholics as manager, though one of these, Willie Maley had spent 50 years at the club and Stein was only the fourth person to be appointed Celtic manager, after Maley, Jimmy McStay and Jimmy McGrory, who was manager for 20 years. It was later suggested that Stein was allowed to leave Celtic temporarily with the intention of later appointing him manager, but MacPherson found no evidence for this."]}, {"page": "Bill Struth", "response": ["Struth was born in Leith, Edinburgh, the eldest child of William Struth senior, a stonemason, and Isabella Cunningham.David Mason and Ian Stewart, \"Mr Struth: The Boss\" (Headline, 2013), p. 18.
