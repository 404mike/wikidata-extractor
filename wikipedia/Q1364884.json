Leo Kadanoff, Benjamin Widom and Michael Fisher developed the ideas of critical exponents and widom scaling. These ideas were unified by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1972, under the formalism of the renormalization group in the context of quantum field theory."]}, {"page": "King's College London", "response": ["Notable alumni in the sciences include Nobel laureates Peter Higgs (Physics), Sir Michael Houghton (Medicine), Michael Levitt (Chemistry), Max Theiler (Medicine) and Sir Frederick Hopkins (Medicine); polymath Sir Francis Galton;\u2018GALTON, Sir Francis\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 Chief Investigator on the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine Sir Andrew Pollard;\"Pollard, Prof. Andrew John, (born 29 Aug. 1965), Professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunity, University of Oxford, since 2008; Fellow, since 2006, and Vice Master, since 2017, St Cross College, Oxford; Senior Investigator, National Institute of Health Research, since 2018.\" WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO. 1 Dec. 2017 Raymond Gosling who took Photograph 51 which was critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA; co-discoverer of Hepatitis C and of the Hepatitis D genome Qui-Lim Choo; pioneer of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) Patrick Steptoe;\u2018STEPTOE, Patrick Christopher\u2019, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920\u20132016 mammal cloning pioneer Keith Campbell;  pathologist Thomas Hodgkin; founder of modern hospice philosophy Dame Cicely Saunders; botanist David Bellamy; Shaw Prize laureate Sir Richard Doll; Kyoto Prize laureate Anthony Pawson; Wolf Prize laureates Michael Fisher (Physics) and Sir James Gowans (Medicine); Lasker Award winner John Hughes; Gairdner Foundation International Award winner R.
