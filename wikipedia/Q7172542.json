In Catholic practice the conferring of abbatial status is closely analogous to the consecration of a bishop\u00a0\u2013 in that both procedures involve conferring a mitre and crozier on the cleric concerned\u00a0\u2013 and therefore the term \"consecration\" does not imply anything other than a kind of formal induction to an abbatial post. Suggestions that Vilatte went even further and consecrated Ignatius a bishop have been discounted by Peter Anson a leading authority on episcopi vagantes, who says that Vilatte did nothing other than ordain Ignatius to the priesthood, making it clear that Ignatius refused to consider being raised to the episcopate, even though it is equally certain that Vilatte did offer to consecrate him.Anson, P.F, 1964.

Anson, whose particular brand of Catholicism included beliefs in continual revelation and in the paranormal, later claimed that he had received a psychic communication from Carlyle at the moment of the former abbot's death in 1955. Some have speculated that the relationship between Carlyle and Anson may have been in some sense homoerotic, based upon Anson's assertion that under Carlyle's rule \"particular spiritual friendships\" were not discouraged, but the most vocal promoter of the idea that Carlyle may have been actively gay seems overly keen upon accentuating his role as a self-styled abbot of an Anglican foundation after the manner of Ignatius Lyne at the expense of his eventual emergence as the Roman Catholic Abbot of Caldey in good standing. This of course proves nothing, but it does lead to questions regarding objectivity. Against this has to be set the actuality that the primary source for information regarding the Caldey Benedictines is Peter Anson, who is credited as being the leading authority on the subject despite his closeness to Carlyle himself, who appears to have regarded Anson as a close friend despite Anson's somewhat unpredictable nature and his inability to settle to the monastic life.Anson, P.F. 1946. A Roving Recluse, Cork, Mercier Press In the final analysis, the question of whether Carlyle could be considered either a religious mountebank or \"gay icon\" cannot be resolved, though the former evaluation seems unfair and even inaccurate.http://anglicanhistory.org/academic/hilliard_unenglish.pdf Article accessed 22 April 2015 Furthermore, as the ecclesiastical historian Rene Kollar OSB indicates: \"Unlike others who sought and failed to bring Roman Catholic practices into the Established Church and failed, Carlyle enjoyed the explicit ecclesiastical sanction of the Archbishop of Canterbury for his work, and with this seal of approval he could dismiss critics and disbelievers...\".Rene M. Kollar, The Harvard Theological Review Vol. 76, No. 2 (Apr. 1983), pp. 205\u2013224 It should also be recognised that whilst Anson's biography of Carlyle indicates that expressions of filial affection between monks \"sometimes took a form which would not be found in any normal monastery to-day (the) embraces, ceremonial and non-ceremonial, were regarded as symbolical of fraternal charity\". His indication that \"Our variant of the Roman rite permitted a real hug and kisses on the cheek between the giver and the recipient of the Pax Domini at the conventual Mass\" appears an honest statement of how things were, and cannot of itself be seen as indicating any departure from celibacy either on the part of Carlyle or of any other monk who was under vows at Caldey during the Anglican years (the reference here to the \"Pax Domini\" reflecting the use of the Tridentine Mass even before the Caldey Benedictine Order made its collective submission to Rome).Anson, P.F. 1958, Abbot Extraordinary, A memoir of Aelred Carlyle, Monk and Missionary, London, Faith Press"]}, {"page": "Richard Williams Morgan", "response": ["More recent writers have been even more critical.

However, these included, for example, the History of the Kings of Britain, the pseudohistory of the origins and early history of Britain by the 12th-century writer Geoffrey of Monmouth, and supposed ancient Welsh texts from the collections of the Welsh antiquarian Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams, 1747\u20131826) that were later proved to be forgeries. Morgan accepted all these as factual records of early British and Welsh history and culture \u2013 and then interpreted them and elaborated on them in the light of his strongly pro-Welsh feelings and his enthusiasm for all things Welsh.Some examples of his methods are discussed in Clark 48\u201352."]}, {"page": "Peter Frederick Anson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Anson"]}, {"page": "Wixenford School", "response": ["The school moved to Luckley Park, Wokingham, Berkshire, in 1887.
