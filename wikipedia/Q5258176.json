He is best remembered for being the last player before Mo Salah to score a league hatrick against Manchester United at Old Trafford.\nBailey started his career at Watford playing in their youth and reserve sides between 1982 and 1984. He subsequently joined Barking, before joining Fulham on non-contract terms in November 1986. He signed for Farnborough Town in February 1987, before returning to league football in December 1987 with Crystal Palace, joining for a fee of \u00a310,000. He was loaned to Bristol Rovers in February 1989, before joining Birmingham City in August of the same year. He was loaned to Bristol Rovers again in March 1991, but returned from his loan to feature as a substitute when Birmingham beat Tranmere Rovers to win the 1991 Associate Members' Cup Final.Bailey signed for Queens Park Rangers for \u00a3175,000 in July 1991. He made his debut on the opening day of the 1991\u201392 season against Arsenal, scoring in a 1\u20131 draw.\nOn 1 January 1992 he scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20131 win away at league leaders Manchester United; one of the last league games to be broadcast live by ITV. He was the last player to have achieved the feat in the league at Old Trafford until Mohamed Salah did the same on October 24th 2021. The only other player to do so after Bailey was Real Madrid's Ronaldo in the 2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League.\nIn total Bailey played 39 league games for QPR, scoring 10 goals. He was soon frozen out of the first team by the likes of Gary Penrice and Bradley Allen, and in October 1993 he was loaned to Charlton Athletic and later that season to Watford. While with Watford he scored in three successive games after coming off the substitutes bench, greatly helping the club's escape from the relegation zone.Bailey was loaned to Brentford in January 1995, before signing for Gillingham in August of the same year, helping them win promotion from Division Three that season. He subsequently played for Lincoln City, before moving into non-league football for a second spell with Farnborough Town.
