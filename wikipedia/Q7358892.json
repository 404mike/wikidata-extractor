By Fall of 1982, the band had recruited keyboardist Roger Scott Craig. Craig had formerly played with Liverpool Express, a British-based group known in Europe and South America. By end of 1982, Fortune's singer (Richard's wife, Colleen Fortune) had left the band and was replaced by vocalist Larry Greene."]}, {"page": "Liverpool Express", "response": ["Musicians Billy Kinsley, Roger Scott Craig, Tony Coates, and Derek Cashin met during a game of football in Liverpool. They decided to form a band which was eventually named Liverpool Express. The songwriting partnership of Kinsley and Craig soon developed when they started getting together in a small rehearsal room at the Bluecoat Chambers in central Liverpool to write and arrange some of the band's early material.Drummer John Ryan joined in 1976, his first TV show 'You Are My Love' on TOTP.", "Roger Scott Craig said: \"The show (we did) in Belo Horizonte came to a complete standstill when I started to play our hit record, \"You Are My Love\", the crowd just went nuts to the point that our singer, Billy, could not even sing the song - he was overwhelmed by the crowd and the tears ran down his face. Astonishing!!! Anyway, I had to keep playing the intro.., until he was able to settle down and get the vocal going! That was something I will never forget - 25,000 people stopping our show and the band coming to a complete halt due to the emotion? There were about 5000 people outside the stadium as well that night who couldn't get in and I remember, as we were leaving, they all seemed to be banging on the roof of our limo as we went back to the hotel!\".", "The following year, following the release of the new album, there were changes to the line-up. Drummer John Ryan continued  playing on the live shows and his mate, guitarist Kenny Parry, replaced Tony Coates. In 1981, Roger Scott Craig emigrated to California.  John Ryan joined 'The Swinging Blue Jeans' in 1980 and returned to Australia in 1983 to marry after meeting his future wife whilst on tour in 1983. Kinsley and Parry continued working together as Liverpool Express and enlisted Dave Goldberg on keyboards, Peter Phillips on keyboards and guitar (1985-1994) and Brian Rawling on drums. This line-up released two singles and a charity record during the 1980s. Kinsley, Goldberg and Parry have since remained the three core members of the band, playing with various stand-in drummers.", "*During the 1990s, Roger Scott Craig wrote music for movies such as The Pelican Brief, Wyatt Earp, and Richie Rich as well as TV commercials."]}, {"page": "Nina Hagen in Ekstasy", "response": ["*Roger Scott Craig \u2013 keyboards"]}, {"page": "Tracks (Liverpool Express album)", "response": ["#\"Smile\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"Hold Tight\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"Never the Same Without Love\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"You Are My Love\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"She's a Lady\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley, Tony Coates)", "#\"Call Me Your Love\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"It's a Beautiful Day\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"(I Remember) Julian the Hooligan\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley, Tony Coates)", "#\"Rosemary\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"Doing It All Again\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"Every Man Must Have a Dream\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley, Tony Coates)", "*Roger Scott Craig\u00a0\u2013 lead, harmony and backing vocals, piano"]}, {"page": "Dreamin' (album)", "response": ["#\"Low Profile\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley, Tony Coates, Derek Cashin)", "#\"Songbird, Sing Your Song\" (Roger Scott Craig)", "#\"Little Plum's Last Stand\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley, Tony Coates, Derek Cashin)", "#\"Mary & Ann\" (Roger Scott Craig)", "#\"Dreamin'\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"All Time Loser\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley, Tony Coates, Derek Cashin)", "*Roger Scott Craig\u00a0\u2013 lead, harmony and backing vocals, piano"]}, {"page": "L.E.X.", "response": ["*Roger Scott Craig\u00a0\u2013 harmony and backing vocals, piano"]}, {"page": "The Best of Liverpool Express", "response": ["*Roger Scott Craig\u00a0\u2013 harmony and backing vocals, piano"]}, {"page": "Once Upon a Time (Liverpool Express album)", "response": ["#\"Once Upon A Time\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"The End of the Game\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"John George Ringo & Paul\" (Roger Scott Craig)", "#\"This Door Is Always Open\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"Tomorrow Is Another Day\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"Sailin' Down To Rio\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "#\"Find My Way Back Home\" (Roger Scott Craig, Billy Kinsley)", "*Roger Scott Craig\u00a0\u2013 harmony and backing vocals, keyboards"]}, {"page": "Liverpool Express discography", "response": ["* Producer: Roger Scott Craig & Billy Kinsley"]}, {"page": "Harlan Cage", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roger Scott Craig#Harlan Cage"]}]}}
