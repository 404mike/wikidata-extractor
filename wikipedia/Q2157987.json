He is most known for his work with Fritz Haber on the fixation of nitrogen from atmospheric air, the Haber process.He was born in Saint Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, and attended school there. He matriculated from the University of London in 1901 and graduated from University College London in 1905 where he remained, becoming a member of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and a Fellow of the Chemical Society of London. In 1908\u20131909, he worked with Fritz Haber in Germany on the difficult problem of demonstrating ammonia synthesis from air, eventually producing a tabletop apparatus that worked at 200 atmospheres pressure. Haber was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery that virtually \"made bread from the air\" and recognized the assistance he'd received from Le Rossignol, whose name appears on Haber's patents for the process.\nHe was interned in Germany in 1914 at the outbreak of the first World War, but was released to work for the Auergesellschaft during the war. He returned to the UK after the war. He joined the General Electric Company (UK) research laboratory, where he remained for the rest of his career, working on thermionic valves.\nHe lived in Penn, Buckinghamshire and was a noted philanthropist using the royalty income he received from the Haber patent. His two sons were both killed during World War II.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Haber process", "response": ["Haber, with his assistant Robert Le Rossignol, developed the high-pressure devices and catalysts needed to demonstrate the Haber process at laboratory scale.. They demonstrated their process in the summer of 1909 by producing ammonia from air, drop by drop, at the rate of about  per hour. The process was purchased by the German chemical company BASF, which assigned Carl Bosch the task of scaling up Haber's tabletop machine to industrial-level production.Bosch, Carl (2 March 1908) \"Process of producing ammonia.\" . He succeeded in 1910. Haber and Bosch were later awarded Nobel prizes, in 1918 and 1931 respectively, for their work in overcoming the chemical and engineering problems of large-scale, continuous-flow, high-pressure technology."]}, {"page": "Fritz Haber", "response": ["During his time at University of Karlsruhe from 1894 to 1911, Haber and his assistant Robert Le Rossignol invented the Haber\u2013Bosch process, which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and pressure. This discovery was a direct consequence of Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle, announced in 1884, which states that when a system is in equilibrium and one of the factors affecting it is changed, the system will respond by minimizing the effect of the change. Since it was known how to decompose ammonia on nickel based catalyst, one could derive from Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle that the reaction could be reversed to produce ammonia at high temperature and pressure (a process that Henry Louis Le Ch\u00e2telier had even tried himself but gave up after his technician almost killed himself, due to an oxygen intake related explosion)."]}, {"page": "History of the Haber process", "response": ["To overcome the problems associated with high pressure, Haber called upon the talents of Robert Le Rossignol, who designed the equipment necessary for the success of the process.Smil 2001, p.78-79 Early in 1909, Haber discovered that osmium could serve as a catalyst.
