The seeds of the story began in 1897, when Jimmy Michael was banned from racing in Britain due to a doping controversy. It was well known that Michael's and Linton's manager Choppy Warburton would carry a 'little black bottle' of an unknown substance to revive his flagging cyclists. During a meet in 1896, Warburton had given Michael a swig from his bottle, but the results did not enhance his performance and Michael was forced to retire. Michael claimed that Warburton had poisoned him, and Warburton then sued Michael for slander. This resulted in Warburton being effectively banned from all cycling events and Michael relocating to America. Although no record of the contents of Warburton's bottle was ever discovered it was speculated to be either strychnine or a substance known as 'trimethyl'. Although doping was not illegal under the rules of cycling at the time, and was common in many racing sports, it was felt that Warburton and Michael had crossed the line of acceptable behaviour."]}, {"page": "Am\u00e9lie Le Gall", "response": ["She trained with controversial English coach Choppy WarburtonFeargal McKay, \"The Little Black Bottle, by Gerry Moore\" Podium Cafe (August 9, 2011).William Fotheringham, Cyclopedia:  It's All About the Bike (Chicago Review Press 2015).  and was sponsored by Simpson Chain, a British manufacturer of an innovative-design  bicycle chain.
