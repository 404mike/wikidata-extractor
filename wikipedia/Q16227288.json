Born in Edmonton, Canada, he received classical music education at the University of Alberta in the mid-1960s and relocated to England, where he composed scores for Ballet Rambert during the 1970s.Around 1970 Lewis got acquainted with Brian Hodgson, who worked at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop at the time. In 1972 Hodgson left the BBC to set up Electrophon studios with Lewis. Under the name \"Wavemaker\", they released albums of melodic synthesiser music titled Where Are We Captain?... (1975) and New Atlantis (1977). In 1977, Hodgson returned to the Radiophonic Workshop and left the Electrophon studio in Lewis' hands.Lewis worked with British new wave band M on their 1979 hit song \"Pop Muzik\".As Hodgson, and the entire Workshop, was heavily involved in creating Doctor Who sound effects and music, he suggested outsourcing some of the work to Lewis, who began recording the original incidental music for the serial The Mark of the Rani, broadcast in 1985. However, Lewis was already suffering from AIDS in an advanced stage, and managed to complete only the first episode of the score, when the fell too ill to complete the score. He died soon afterwards, and the score was finished by Jonathan Gibbs. Lewis' score for the first episode was included on the DVD release.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Lewis (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Lewis (1940\u20132020) was the president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and a member of US House of Representatives from Georgia.", "John Lewis may also refer to:", "* John Lewis (computer scientist) (born 1963), American computer science educator and author", "* John Lewis (headmaster) (born 1942), New Zealand headmaster of Eton College", "* John Lewis (philosopher) (1889\u20131976), British Unitarian minister and Marxist philosopher", "* John Lewis (brewer) (1713\u20131792), British brewer", "* John Lewis (department store founder) (1836\u20131928), British draper and founder of the John Lewis department store", "* John Spedan Lewis (1885\u20131963), British industrial democracy pioneer, founder of the John Lewis Partnership", "* John Lewis (antiquarian) (1675\u20131747), English clergyman", "* John Lewis (archbishop of Ontario) (1825\u20131901), Anglican bishop, archbishop and author in Canada", "* John Lewis (archdeacon of Cheltenham) (born 1934), British Anglican priest", "* John Lewis (archdeacon of Hereford) (1909\u20131984), Anglican priest", "* John Lewis (archdeacon of North-West Europe) (1939\u20131994), Archdeacon of North West Europe from 1982 to 1993", "* John Lewis (bishop of North Queensland) (1926\u20132015), Australian Anglican bishop", "* John Lewis (dean of Llandaff) (born 1947), Welsh Anglican priest", "* John Lewis (dean of Ossory) (1717\u20131783), Dean of Ossory in Ireland from 1755 to 1783", "* John Lewis (electronic musician) (died 1984), Canadian-British electronic music composer", "* John Lewis (pianist) (1920\u20132001), American jazz pianist and composer with the Modern Jazz Quartet", "* John Lewis (singer) (born 1947), British singer and multi-instrumentalist known professionally as Jona Lewie", "*John Lewis (1940\u20132020), member of US House of Representatives from Georgia ", "*John Lewis (Arizona politician) (born 1957), businessman and mayor of Gilbert, Arizona", "*John Lewis (California politician) (born 1954), politician in the California Senate", "*John Lewis (Shawnee leader) ( \u2013 1826), Native American leader of the Shawnee in Lewistown, Ohio", "* John Lewis (Australian politician) (1844\u20131923), South Australian pastoralist and politician", "*John Lewis (of Abernant) (1580\u2013?), Welsh MP", "*John Lewis (Radnor MP) (1738\u20131797), Welsh MP for New Radnor", "*John Lewis (British politician) (1912\u20131969), British Labour Party MP", "*John Lewis (Canadian senator) (1858\u20131935), newspaper editor and senator", "*John Lewis (New Brunswick politician) (1804\u2013?), judge and politician", "*John Lewis (Newfoundland politician) (1867\u20131922), politician in Newfoundland", "*John Lewis (cricketer) (1867\u20131939), Australian cricketer", "*John Lewis (footballer, born 1881) (1881\u20131954), Welsh international football player", "*John Lewis (footballer, born 1949), Australian rules footballer for Hawthorn", "*John Lewis (footballer, born 1953), Australian rules footballer for Fitzroy", "*John Lewis (footballer, born 1954), English football player for Orient", "*John Lewis (footballer, born 1955), Welsh football player and manager", "*John Lewis (referee) (1855\u20131926), English football player, administrator, referee and co-founder of Blackburn Rovers F.C.", "*John Lewis (weightlifter) (born 1943), Canadian Olympic weightlifter", "* John Lewis (criminal) (died 1910), American gangster from New York City, known as Spanish Louie", "* John Lewis (journalist) (born 1933), Australian journalist", "* John Lewis (Nebraska activist) (1841\u2013?), hotelier, musician, and civil rights activist in Omaha, Nebraska", "* John Lewis (typographer) (1912\u20131996), British typographer and illustrator", "* John Lewis & Partners, a chain of department stores in the United Kingdom", "* John Lewis Partnership, a United Kingdom employee-owned retailer", "* USNS John Lewis (T-AO-205), lead ship of a class of US military tankers"]}, {"page": "The Mark of the Rani", "response": ["The music score for this story was provided by composer Jonathan Gibbs.
