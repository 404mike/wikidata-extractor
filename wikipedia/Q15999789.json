Following the war, he was promoted to the rank of commander on 31 December 1918. In June 1919 he made a second first-class appearance for the Royal Navy, in a match against Cambridge University at Fenner's, making scores of 2 and 0 in a heavy loss for the Royal Navy. Irwin later joined Cornwall, most likely while posted at HMNB Devonport in Plymouth, with his debut for the county coming against Devon in the 1921 Minor Counties Championship. He played Minor counties cricket for Cornwall until 1925, making 41 appearances during that time. Playing for Cornwall made Irwin eligible to be selected for a combined Minor Counties team, appearing in one first-class match for the team in 1924 against HDG Leveson Gower's XI at The Saffrons, Eastbourne. Dismissed for a duck by Francis Browne in their first-innings, he improved in their second-innings with a score of 80, his second first-class half century. In that same season he appeared in another first-class match for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University at Lord's, though he had little success in this match."]}, {"page": "Herbert Hodgson", "response": ["Hodgson made his debut in county cricket for Cheshire against the Essex Second XI in 1914. He returned to playing Minor counties cricket for Cheshire following the end of World War I, playing a further 48 matches for the county from 1920 to 1932, with his final appearance coming against the Yorkshire Second XI. He captained Cheshire in 1929. He was later selected to represent a combined Minor Counties cricket team in 1924, making his first-class debut against HDG Leveson Gower's XI at The Saffrons, Eastbourne. In this match, Hodgson scored 1 in the Minor Counties first-innings, before being dismissed by Francis Browne, while in their second-innings he scored 45 runs, before being dismissed by Gerry Crutchley. He later made a second first-class appearance for the team in 1929 against the touring South Africans at the County Ground, Stoke-on-Trent.
