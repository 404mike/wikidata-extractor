It was calculated by the late David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the school about \u00a31,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the school. This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as \"assisted places\") to independent schools. However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the school has always been lower. Eton's former Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.) have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status. The fee for the academic year 2021\u20132022 was \u00a344,094 (approximately US$60,000 or \u20ac52,000 as of November 2021), although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships."]}, {"page": "Haileybury and Imperial Service College", "response": ["In the late 20th century, reforming headmaster David Jewell took charge of Haileybury, bringing it out of its post-Cold War austerity.
