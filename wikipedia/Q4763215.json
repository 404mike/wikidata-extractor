She was a member of a band known as New City Sounds, which performed on the BBC television programme Opportunity Knocks. The band won twice in the talent competition. After her two appearances on Opportunity Knocks, Miller left the band and recorded music in the early 1970s under the RAK Records label, which was owned by Mickie Most, who also produced her music. She recorded two songs \"Born To Be Loved By You\" and \"Stardust In Your Eyes\", as well as an album, titled A Woman's Mind.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mickie Most", "response": ["With RAK Records, Most's success continued with folk singer Julie Felix's charting cover of Simon & Garfunkel's \"El Condor Pasa\". Felix was the first artist signed to the label. Most then produced Mary Hopkin's 1970 hit \"Temma Harbour\" for Apple Records, followed by her Eurovision Song Contest entry, \"Knock, Knock Who's There?\". In 1970, Most approached Suzi Quatro for a recording contract after seeing her on stage at a Detroit dance hall with the band Cradle (which also had Quatro's sisters Arlene, Patti, and Nancy as members), while on a production assignment in Chicago. Quatro was among a growing roster of artists signed to RAK Records which included Alexis Korner's CCS, Arrows, Smokie (with Chris Norman) (originally spelt Smokey), Hot Chocolate, Angie Miller, Chris Spedding, and Heavy Metal Kids. Hiring the songwriting production team of Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, RAK scored several British number 1 singles with Suzi Quatro (\"Can the Can\" and \"Devil Gate Drive\") and Mud (\"Tiger Feet\", \"Lonely This Christmas\" and \"Oh Boy\")."]}, {"page": "Angie Miller", "response": ["* Angie Miller (American singer) (born 1994), American singer-songwriter and American Idol contestant", "* Angie Miller (British singer), British singer in the 1970s"]}, {"page": "Angie Miller (british singer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Angie Miller (British singer) "]}, {"page": "List of records by RAK Records", "response": ["| 151 || Angie Miller || Stardust In Your Eyes || L.
