He was born in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire and died at Headingley, Leeds, Yorkshire.\nThe son of a brewer, Robinson was educated at Appleby Grammar School near Atherstone in Warwickshire and at St John's College, Cambridge. In his first year at Cambridge University he appears not to have played rugby, but he was chosen for the freshmen's match cricket trial, and scored 11 and 58, batting in the lower-order. But he was not then given any first-team games in that or the subsequent two seasons. From 1892, he played first-team rugby for the Cambridge rugby team regularly and he was awarded a Blue in both 1892 and 1893, playing in the annual Varsity Match against Oxford. He returned to cricket in 1893, finally playing a single first-class game for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the university side, a ploy sometimes used by Cambridge to try out new players; he scored 15 and 12 not out but still did not earn a call-up to the university side. In 1894, however, he was tried in an early match for the university team as an opening bowler and proceeded to take seven wickets for 93 runs in the first innings he bowled in: these remained his career best bowling figures. He then retained his place as a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm opening bowler to the end of the university season, and appeared in the University Match against Oxford University, thereby becoming a \"double Blue\".Robinson appeared in four rugby internationals for England. He played in an 8-0 defeat by Scotland while an undergraduate at Cambridge, and then played against all the other three \"home\" international side in 1902, when his club rugby was for Headingley. He did not play any further first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1894. He became a solicitor and practised at Nottingham and Leeds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of cricket and rugby union players", "response": ["| John Robinson"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|258||John Robinson||forward ||1893-03-04||v Scotland at Leeds"]}, {"page": "John Robinson", "response": ["John Robinson may refer to:", "* John Robinson (Australian statistician), professor at Sydney University and 2008 recipient of the Statistical Society of Australia Pitman Medal", "*John Robinson (organist) (1682\u20131762), English organist", "*John Robinson (English actor) (1908\u20131979), British actor, known for Quatermass II", "*John Robinson (sculptor) (1935\u20132007), British sculptor", "*John Robinson (drummer) (born 1954), American drummer and session musician", "*John Robinson (church musician) (born 1983), organist and choir director", "*John Robinson (American actor) (born 1985), American actor", "*John Robinson (Canadian actor), Canadian actor", "*Jon-John Robinson (born 1970), American record producer and songwriter", "*John Robinson (1843\u20131921), owner of the John Robinson Circus", "*John Robinson (militiaman) (1735\u20131805), American Revolutionary War militia officer", "*John Robinson (Medal of Honor) (1840\u2013?), U.S. Navy sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Robinson (aviator) (1905\u20131954), American aviator and activist", "*John Robinson (businessman) (1782\u20131828), merchant and political figure in New Brunswick", "*Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto (1791\u20131863), lawyer, judge and political figure in Upper Canada, kinsman of John Robinson (1650\u20131723)", "*Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of London (1615\u20131680), Lord Mayor of London, MP for the City of London, Middlesex and Rye", "*John Robinson (Liskeard MP) (1620\u2013?), English politician in House of Commons in 1660", "*John Robinson (Harwich MP) (1727\u20131802), British Member of Parliament for Harwich, 1774\u20131803", "*John Robinson (New York politician) (1654\u20131734), Member of the New York General Assembly of 1691", "*John Robinson (Virginia politician) (1705\u20131766), Speaker of the House of Burgesses in Virginia ", "*John Robinson (Virginian) (1822\u20131900), African American state Senator in Virginia", "*John Robinson (judge) (1880\u20131951), Chief Justice of the Washington Supreme Court", "*John Robinson (Maine politician) (born 1972), served in the Maine House of Representatives", "*John Robinson (agriculture commissioner), North Carolina politician", "*John Robinson (US Marshal) (1838\u20131917), sheriff of Bennington County, Vermont and US Marshal for the District of Vermont", "*John Robinson (pastor) (1576\u20131625), English pastor who organized the Mayflower voyage", "*John Robinson (bishop of London) (1650\u20131723), English diplomat, Bishop of Bristol, Lord Privy Seal etc.", "*John Robinson (historian) (1774\u20131840), English cleric", "*John Robinson (priest) (1852\u20131916), Dean of Belfast", "*John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich) (John Arthur Thomas Robinson, 1919\u20131983), British Bishop of Woolwich", "*John Robinson (Archdeacon of Bedford) (died 1598), English priest and academic", "*John Robinson (1868\u20131898), English cricketer", "*John Robinson (sportsman) (1872\u20131959), English cricketer and rugby union footballer", "*John Robinson (1891\u20131966), Australian rules footballer", "*John Robinson (1909\u20131988), English cricketer", "*John Robinson (born 1935), American football coach", "*John Robinson (born 1971), Welsh footballer", "* John Robinson (17th century), associate of William Shakespeare", "* John Robinson (merchant), British merchant in the 19th century", "* John Robinson (engineer) (1823\u20131902), British locomotive engineer", "* John Robinson (Natal politician) (1839\u20131903), prime minister of Colony of Natal", "* John Robinson (brewer) (1895\u20131978), British brewing executive and local politician", "* John Robinson (architect), architect of the Isle of Man who designed two Registered Buildings", "* John Robinson (architect, born 1829), designer of St Lawrence and Mary Magdalene Drinking Fountain, London"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* John Robinson (1889\u20131896) : J.
