During those wars he was employed by The Times, and his eye-witness reports did much to alert western nations of war crimes committed by the Italians in Ethiopia and by the Germans in Spain, although little was done to prevent them by the League of Nations. He returned to Ethiopia after the world war started and helped the campaign defeat the Italians and restore Hailie Selassie to the throne.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 25", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 George Steer, South African-English journalist and author (b. 1909)"]}, {"page": "1937", "response": ["* April 26 \u2013 Spanish Civil War: The Bombing of Guernica is carried out in Spain, by the Condor Legion of the Nazi German Luftwaffe, in support of the Francoists.
