A fluent right hand bat, he was also an occasional bowler of lobs who sometimes switched to quick overarm deliveries. He captained England in two Test matches, winning them both.

As mainstays Jupp and Southerton declined from 1875, matters were ameliorated by the discovery of class amateur batsmen in Bunny Lucas, Walter Read and William Game, but apart from 1877 Surrey never won half as many games as they lost and the inadequacy of the bowling on flat Oval pitches was a severe handicap.", "In 1880, although the county's record remained bad, Surrey began to make the steps that would return them to the top of the table with the appointment of John Shuter as captain and of Walter Read \u2013 established as a class batsman but previously available only in August \u2013 as assistant secretary. The death of Southerton and retirement of other veterans paved the way for new talent in Maurice Read, William Roller, left-arm spinner Edward Barratt and pace bowler Charles Horner to lay a foundation for long-term success in the middle 1880s. With the rapid rise of George Lohmann in 1885, Surrey challenged for the unofficial title of Champion County for the first time in twenty years; then, by winning 32 of 42 matches in 1887, 1888 and 1889, Surrey were first or equal first in the final three years before official County Champions emerged.", "*  Walter Read"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket hat-tricks", "response": ["* George Bonnor (c Walter Read)"]}, {"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| rowspan=3 | Walter Read100px"]}, {"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["Hawke played in three first-class matches against South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.
