This was the Putting-out system that survived in weaving long after the factory system was normal for spinning. He had commercial connections with Arkwright and with Drinkwater. To obtain yarn he opened a mill in 1791 at the Carrs, on the Tin Brook and a large mill at Mellor. The combination of a good water power site (described by Rodgers as \"by far the finest of any site within the lowland\" [of the Manchester region] ) and a large female and child workforce  used to textile factory work meant Stockport was well placed to take advantage of the phenomenal expansion in cotton processing in the late 18th century.  Warren's mill in the market place was the first.  Power came from an undershot water wheel in a deep pit, fed by a tunnel from the River Goyt.    In 1796, James Harrisson drove a wide cut from the Tame which fed several mills in the Park, Portwood.; Ashmore (1975).   In 1786, Henry Marsland gained water rights to erect another mill adjacent to the   by  Park silk mill which he already owned. The two Carrs silk mills had converted to cotton before 1785, and the larger silk mills such as Park and Logwood followed."]}]}}
