There's a lack of understanding of Muslims already and I think EastEnders really lost an opportunity to present a normal friendly Muslim character to the British public.\" One British Muslim fan of EastEnders reportedly told the Al Arabiya news channel that the storyline \"is not a true reflection of the majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom.\" Another British Muslim said \"I think it's bad, it is going to give a bad impression about Islam. The type of people that watch EastEnders are going to be very na\u00efve about such a portrayal of Muslims,\" but added that Muslims probably would not boycott the show as \"generally practicing Muslims don't really watch EastEnders.\""]}, {"page": "List of awards and nominations received by EastEnders", "response": ["| Marc Elliott (Syed Masood) || ", "| Best Newcomer || Marc Elliott (Syed Masood) || ", "| Best Newcomer || Marc Elliott (Syed Masood) || ", "| Best Soap Newcomer || Marc Elliott (Syed Masood) || ", "| Fatal Attraction || Marc Elliott and John Partridge (Syed Masood and Christian Clarke) || ", "| Bride and Doom || Marc Elliott and Preeya Kalidas (Syed Masood and Amira Shah) || "]}, {"page": "Amira Masood", "response": ["Amira Masood (also Shah) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Preeya Kalidas.
