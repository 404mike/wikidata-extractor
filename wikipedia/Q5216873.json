He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the Royal College of Physicians (Coxe is the Society member referred to by Samuel Pepys in his diary entry of 3 May 1665 when he poisons a cat with tobacco oil at Gresham College). Coxe was appointed a physician to the court of King Charles II of England and later to that of Queen Anne.", "Initially Coxe purchased land in West Jersey in the mid-1680s.

He lived in the American colonies from 1702 to 1716 and after returning to England published an account in 1722 of his travels and a description of the area encompassed by his father's claim, entitled A Description of the English Province of Carolana, by the Spaniards called Florida, And by the French La Louisiane. He was appointed by the Duke of Norfolk as Provincial Grand Master of Freemasons for the provinces of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but died before he had chartered any lodges.  In 1731, he claimed that he possessed superior title to that of the West Jersey Society, via a superseding deed that his father had recorded years earlier; the courts upheld Coxe's claim.  Hundreds of families were forced to repurchase their own property from Col. Coxe or be forcibly evicted.  The ensuing scandal was one of many injustices that inflamed American anger against the British during the years leading up the Revolutionary War.  There were lawsuits; there were riots; Col. Coxe was burned in effigy; but to no avail.  As a result, many Hopewell residents left New Jersey, either unable to pay Col. Coxe or disgusted with the colony's rampant political corruption.  One group of Hopewell expatriates settled on the Yadkin River in what was then Rowan County, NC.  This community, the Jersey Settlement, continued to attract new settlers from the Hopewell area for several decades."]}, {"page": "Dan Evans (tennis)", "response": ["| Daniel Cox", "| Daniel Cox", "| Daniel Cox", "| Daniel Cox", "| Daniel Cox"]}, {"page": "2010 ITF Men's Circuit", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"|  Daniel Cox", "|bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"|  Daniel Cox", "|bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"|  Daniel Cox", "|bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"|  Daniel Cox", "|bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"|  Daniel Cox"]}, {"page": "Uladzimir Ignatik", "response": ["| Daniel Cox"]}, {"page": "Oliver Golding", "response": ["| Daniel Cox Daniel Smethurst"]}, {"page": "Sergiy Stakhovsky", "response": ["| Daniel Cox Daniel Smethurst"]}, {"page": "Petits As", "response": ["|2004 ||  Andrew Thomas ||  Daniel Cox || 4\u20136, 6\u20132, 6\u20132"]}, {"page": "Peter Polansky", "response": ["| Daniel Cox"]}, {"page": "Chris Eaton (tennis)", "response": ["| Daniel Cox   Uladzimir Ignatik", "| Daniel Cox   Adam Hubble"]}, {"page": "Simon Stadler", "response": ["In June, Stadler qualified in singles for the 2008 Wimbledon Championships, beating British junior No. 949 Daniel Cox (a week after Cox knocked off No. 67 Thomaz Bellucci), No. 248 Rainer Eitzinger and No. 270 Nicol\u00e1s Todero.
