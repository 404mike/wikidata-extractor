He has been described as \"the greatest director general that the BBC never had\".Singer was born in Bradford, England, left school aged 17 to train as a film editor, and joined the BBC in 1949. He was head of the Features Group which included Science & Features, Arts Features, and General Features. This group largely made documentary programmes. Singer took the lead in finding international funding for very ambitious co-productions, leading to the so-called 'Science Spectaculars' written by Nigel Calder, and then the 13-part \"personal view\" series such as Civilisation (1969) and The Ascent of Man (1973).\nHe was also largely responsible for the historic 1967 Our World global satellite broadcast, which featured The Beatles.Singer was the controller of BBC2 from 1974 until 1978, who replaced Robin Scott and was replaced himself by Brian Wenham. He spoke to the Oxford University Broadcasting Society in 1975.From 1978 Singer was managing director of BBC Radio and from 1982 he was managing director of BBC Television. He was appointed a CBE in 1984. After early retirement from the BBC, he established White City Films where he was managing director until 1996.\nSinger married Cynthia Adams in 1949 and they had two children.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BBC Two", "response": ["* 1974\u20131978: Aubrey Singer"]}, {"page": "BBC Radio", "response": ["|1978|| Aubrey Singer"]}, {"page": "The Ascent of Man", "response": ["The title alludes to The Descent of Man (1871), Charles Darwin's second book on evolution. Over the series' 13 episodes, Jacob Bronowski travels around the world in order to trace the development of human society through its understanding of science. It was commissioned specifically to complement Kenneth Clark's Civilisation (1969), in which Clark argued that art reflected and was informed by the major driving forces in cultural evolution. Bronowski wrote in his 1951 book The Commonsense of Science: \"It has been one of the most destructive modern prejudices that art and science are different and somehow incompatible interests\". Both series were commissioned by David Attenborough, then controller of BBC Two, whose colleague Aubrey Singer had been astonished by Attenborough prioritising an arts series given his science background.Attenborough interview in The Ascent of Man DVD set"]}, {"page": "BBC Radio 3", "response": ["In 1978, Ian McIntyre took over as controller of Radio 3 but quickly faced uncomfortable relationships between departments. At approximately the same time Aubrey Singer became managing director of Radio and began to make programming on the station more populist in a drive to retain listeners in face of possible competition from competitors using a \"streamed format\". An example of this is the replacement of Homeward Bound in 1980 with an extended, presenter-driven programme called Mainly for Pleasure. The same year an internal paper recommended the disbandment of several of the BBC's orchestras and of the Music Division, resulting in low morale and industrial action by musicians that delayed the start of the Proms. Senior management was also getting dissatisfied with listening figures leading to the Director-General Alasdair Milne to suggest that presentation style was \"too stodgy and old-fashioned\"."]}, {"page": "Our World (1967 TV program)", "response": ["The project was conceived by BBC producer Aubrey Singer.

He soon introduced the use of live \"on the spot\" reporting and interviews during radio news bulletins. These live inserts were called in by telephone, which led to some complaints about quality, but the practice caught on and became a key aspect of the format of news reports. Woon also supported the introduction of female newsreaders.  In 1979 Woon and Aubrey Singer took the decision to add a permanent female presenter to BBC Radio Four's influential Today current affairs programme. This was a significant step forward, since only six years earlier Radio Four's presentation editor had said, \"A news announcer needs to have authority, consistency and reliability. Women may have one or two of these qualities, but not all three\"."]}]}}
