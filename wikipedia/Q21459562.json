Martin has also explored ideas of movement in the activities of games: among artists whose work has explored chess, Martin has been described as \"perhaps the most important\". His work appears in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Tate, and British Council, among others. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum: \n\n[Martin] has worked in various media - including kinetic sculpture, film, performance, and the making of environments - but the constant in his work has been drawing, either as a working tool, as a means of recording and observing, or as an end in itself. For Martin, drawing is a system of signs analogous to those of language, and also an intellectual process of enquiry, analysis and proposition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derek (TV series)", "response": ["* Barry Martin as Joe"]}, {"page": "Sexton Blake and the Demon God", "response": ["*Barry Martin as Mordecai"]}]}}
