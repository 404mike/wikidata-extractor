For want of leadership the attack was flagging when Private Ryder, realising the situation and without a moment's thought for his own safety dashed, absolutely alone, at the enemy trench and by skilful handling of his Lewis gun succeeded in clearing the trench. This very gallant act inspired his comrades, made the subsequent advance possible and turned what could have been failure into success.\nHe later achieved the rank of sergeant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harefield", "response": ["* Sergeant Robert Edward Ryder VC (1895\u20131978), who served in World War I in the Middlesex Regiment, was born and is buried in Harefield.
