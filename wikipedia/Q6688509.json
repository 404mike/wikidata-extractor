Her beauty and high spirits made her at once a popular favourite in a large number of comedy parts, until in 1831 she was married to Captain John Alexander Nisbett and retired. Her husband, however, was killed the same year by a fall from his horse, and she was compelled to reappear on the stage in 1832. She was the original Lady Gay Spanker of London Assurance (1841).\nIn 1844 she withdrew again from the stage to marry Sir William Boothby, Bart., but on his death (1846), returned to play many parts, including Lady Teazle, Portia, and three dramatic parts created by Knowles: Constantine in the Love Chase and Helen and Julia in the Hunchback. It was as Lady Teazle that she made her final appearance in 1851.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Helena Faucit", "response": ["Her Lady Macbeth of the 1843 season was, however, a failure; Macready found her conception deficient in \"heart\", and she was physically unable to achieve the commanding presence of Sarah Siddons, as Macready wished. She was, moreover passed over for Rosalind in favour of Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett; this role would later become one of her best-known Shakespearean roles. Nevertheless, Macready considered her \"beyond all compare\" the best English actress of the period."]}, {"page": "Cranstoun", "response": ["*Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett (1812\u201358), English actress"]}, {"page": "Nisbett", "response": ["* Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett (1812\u20131858), actor"]}, {"page": "Alfred Wigan", "response": ["Born at Blackheath to James Wigan, a teacher of languages and Secretary of the Dramatic Authors' Society, the actor and playwright Horace Wigan was his younger brother. Little is known of Wigan's early career, but it is believed he toured for a period as a singer. Using his middle name, he acted as Sidney or Sydney Wigan at the Lyceum Theatre in 1834, and 1835 he appeared with Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett at the Queen's Theatre. He then appeared under the name of Sidney Wigan with John Braham at the newly built St James's Theatre, creating the role of John Johnson in The Strange Gentleman by Charles Dickens. With Lucia Elizabeth Vestris he appeared from 1839 to 1844 at Covent Garden, playing the original Sir Otto of Steinberg in Love by James Sheridan Knowles. On 5 August 1839 he married the actress Leonora Pincott, who afterwards would be billed as Mrs Alfred Wigan."]}, {"page": "Louisa Cranstoun Nesbitt", "response": ["#REDIRECT Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett"]}, {"page": "Louisa Cranstoun Boothby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett"]}, {"page": "The Taming of the Shrew in performance", "response": ["Shakespeare's The Shrew was not performed again until 1844, the last of his plays restored to the repertory, 211 years since the last definite performance. That year, Benjamin Webster directed a production designed by J.R. Planch\u00e9 at the Haymarket Theatre. Starring Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett as Katherina and Webster himself as Petruchio, the production was staged in a minimalist Elizabethan manner, with only two simple locations; the outside of the alehouse, and the Lord's chamber in which the play is staged for Christopher Sly. The Induction was included in full, with Sly remaining at the front of the stage after Act 1, Scene 1, and slowly falling asleep over the course of the play. At the end, as the final curtain falls, the Lord's attendants came and carried him off-stage. Planch\u00e9 referred to his role in returning the play to the stage as \"one of the events in my theatrical career on which I look back with greatest pride and gratification.\" The play received mixed reviews, with many criticising Webster's performance, and accusing the production of being overly bawdy, but it was a box office success and was revived in 1847."]}, {"page": "William John Hammond", "response": ["From 25 April 1836 for three years he and his brother-in-law Douglas Jerrold held the lease on the small Royal Strand Theatre in London, enlarging the theatre in 1836 and adding a gallery in 1839.
