However, the Minister of Health was not responsible for recruitment (this was left to health authorities) and Sir George Godber, Chief Medical Officer for Her Majesty's Government in England from 1960 to 1973, stated that the allegation was \"bunk\u00a0... absolute rubbish. There was no such policy\". Powell's biographer Simon Heffer also stated that the claim \"is a complete untruth. As Powell's biographer I have been thoroughly through the Ministry of Health papers at the Public Record Office and have found no evidence to support this assertion\".The Times (17 February 1998), p. 21.", "Powell's biographer, Simon Heffer, described the defeat of Lords reform as \"perhaps the greatest triumph of Powell's political career\".", "Powell, in an interview on 26 February, said he would be voting for Helene Middleweek, the Labour candidate, rather than the Conservative Nicholas Budgen. Powell did not stay up on election night to watch the results on television, and when on 1 March he picked up his copy of The Times from his letterbox and saw the headline \"Mr Heath's general election gamble fails\", he reacted by singing the Te Deum. He later said: \"I had had my revenge on the man who had destroyed the self-government of the United Kingdom\". The election result was a hung parliament. Although the Tories had won the most votes, Labour finished five seats ahead of the Conservatives. The national swing to Labour was 1 per cent; 4 per cent in Powell's heartland, the West Midlands conurbation; and 16 per cent in his old constituency (although Budgen won the seat). According to the Telegraph journalist Simon Heffer, both Powell and Heath believed that Powell had been responsible for the Conservatives' losing the election.", "In March 2015, The Independent reported that Powell was one of the MPs whose activities had been investigated as part of Operation Fernbridge. His name had been passed to police by Paul Butler, the Bishop of Durham, after allegations of Powell's involvement in historic child abuse had been made by one individual in the 1980s to the then Bishop of Monmouth, Dominic Walker. Simon Heffer, who has published a biography of Powell, has described the allegation as a \"monstrous lie\" and criticised the Church of England's actions in \"putting this smear into the public domain\", while the church stated that it had simply responded to an inquiry from the press and confirmed that allegations about Powell, which related to an alleged satanic cult rather than any criminal activity, had been passed to the police.Gledhill, Ruth (30 March 2015). \"Enoch Powell 'satanic cult' claims: CofE defends decision to pass name to police\".
