Local groups formed to support Corbyn's leadership, uniting several factions of the left across Britain. Lansman was active in Tony Benn's 1981 deputy leadership bid and, after volunteering for Corbyn's leadership bid, had become the director of Jeremy Corbyn Campaign 2015 (Supporters) Ltd, which held the data collected during the campaign. In addition to their support of Corbyn, Momentum has three primary goals: to win elections for Labour, to create a socialist Labour government, and to help build a broader social movement. Corbyn was positive about Momentum after it was formed, saying in 2016: \"I see Momentum as a social movement. A movement that will campaign on all of these issues. But above all, excite and unite people to come together, to come together to challenge injustice, inequality and social exclusion. Bring people together to achieve things together. That is what is makes us [Labour] so different from every other political party in this country.\"", "After their defeat in the 2019 general election, in which Labour lost 60 seats, Jeremy Corbyn and Momentum national coordinator Laura Parker resigned. The election loss led Corbyn to call a leadership election, coupled with the deputy leadership election, with the results of both elections announced in April 2020. On 14 January 2020, Momentum ran a two-day online consultation with their members about endorsing Rebecca Long-Bailey for leader and Angela Rayner for deputy leader. The consultation's closed format was controversial. Of the 7,395 members participating, 70 percent supported Long-Bailey and 52 percent supported Rayner. Momentum planned hundreds of phone-banking events to support Long-Bailey. Keir Starmer won the election in the first round (with Long-Bailey receiving 28 percent of the vote), and Momentum failed to win any of the National Executive Committee by-elections. Momentum congratulated Starmer on his victory, and positioned themselves to work with the new leadership for \"transformational policies\". In May 2020, Momentum founder Jon Lansman announced that he would step down as chairman the following month.", "During the Corbyn years, Momentum was neutral about remaining in the European Union and supported the Labour Party position. Several Momentum members have supported a second referendum, however, with remaining and the government's deal as options. The People's Vote advocacy group, which included trade-union leaders and former Momentum members, was launched in April 2018. The group's launch statement was signed by TSSA union general secretary Manuel Cortes, economist Ann Pettifor, former Momentum steering group member Michael Chessum and former CWU general secretary Billy Hayes. A November 2018 poll of Momentum members found that a majority supported a second referendum.

In March 2019, 188 Momentum activists sent an open letter to Jon Lansman supporting a second referendum.", "In 2017, the Labour Party began a democracy review which would give its membership greater voting capabilities. Momentum has advocated greater membership involvement in party decision-making and \"bolder reforms\", such as Labour members having a larger role in policy development. Momentum has pushed for lowering of the nomination threshold for Labour leadership candidates, so a left-wing successor to Corbyn could more easily contest a future election. Jon Lansman, however, called the proposed Labour reforms \"tinkering around the edges\".", "In 2017, Momentum and the Campaign for Socialism (their Scottish sister organisation) won five of the eight seats on the Scottish Labour executive committee. At that year's Labour conference, it was announced that the party would add three more member-elected positions on the NEC in response to a significant rise in membership. During the balloting period, Peter Willsman was removed from Momentum's list of recommended candidates after an allegation of antisemitism; Willsman had been recorded as describing some Jewish critics of Labour as \"Trump fanatics\".
