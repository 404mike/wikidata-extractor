He was mainly associated with Sussex, and he made 4 known appearances in first-class matches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Lillywhite", "response": ["Lillywhite's seasons in Brighton improved his bowling enough to earn him a debut for Sussex in 1825. His chance came in part due to a desire to test the emerging roundarm bowling style against established players, and his first matches were the so-called Roundarm trial matches, in which he was permitted to bowl roundarm. Lillywhite played his first of these games in Brighton on 13 June against Kent. Batting first, Lillywhite made 41 to complement the 70 made by opener George Brown and career-best 85 by Charles Pierpoint. He then took two wickets in his first outing with the ball, and a third in Kent's second innings as Kent were dismissed for 40 and 43, losing by 243 runs. Lillywhite made two more appearances for his county that season, and finished the year with thirteen wickets. He made four more appearances in 1826, while continuing to play West Sussex against East Sussex matches in Brighton and Petworth. He took 27 first-class wickets that summer, including sixteen wickets \u2013 seven in the first innings and nine in the second \u2013 as part of a combined Surrey and Sussex team against Hampshire in Bramshill on 7 August. Though he only features in five matches in 1827, eight the following season, and seven more the year after that, Lillywhite's wicket tallies continued to grow from twenty to thirty-four and then forty-two wickets including four five-wicket hauls in 1829, both representing then-career best return. He thus established himself in the county side, and was rewarded with twelve matches in 1832 in which he took seventy-one wickets. He was also invited to play for the Marylebone Cricket Club from 1830 onwards, for whom he would go on to take over 400 wickets."]}, {"page": "Roundarm trial matches", "response": [":Sussex: George Brown, George Meads, Thomas Pierpoint, Edward Thwaites, Jem Broadbridge, William Slater, William Lillywhite, William Broadbridge, James Dale, Charles Duff, Charles Pierpoint"]}, {"page": "Pierpoint", "response": ["*Charles Pierpoint (1795-?), English athlete in cricket"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|Charles Pierpoint"]}, {"page": "Pierpoint, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Pierpoint"]}]}}
