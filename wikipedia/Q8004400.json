Scotland faced Wales in their last match in the 1884 British Home Championship on the day of the cup final and were forced to field a reserve eleven. After half an hour of play in the final, Forrest (who was playing at right-half) \"delivered an excellent pass\" to Jimmy Brown who rounded two defenders prior to crossing the ball into the Queen's Park goalmouth. The goalkeeper, George Gillespie, was unable to clear the ball which fell to Joe Sowerbutts who had only to apply the gentlest touch to help the ball between the posts. Shortly after, William Anderson thought he had scored for the Scots but the goal was disallowed for offside by referee Francis Marindin. Forrest then scored Blackburn's second goal \u2013 after the ball was partially cleared by Gillespie it fell to Joe Lofthouse who returned it into the goalmouth where Forrest was waiting to put the ball in the net. Forrest was almost certainly offside but, in the absence of an appeal by the Scots, Mandarin allowed the goal to stand. By half-time, Queen's Park had pulled a goal back through Christie. In the second half, both sides had goals disallowed for offside, but there was no further score, and Blackburn Rovers took the cup for the first time."]}, {"page": "1882 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||||William Anderson"]}, {"page": "1881 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|FW || || William Anderson"]}, {"page": "1882\u201383 in Scottish football", "response": ["|John Smith, Eadie Fraser, William Anderson"]}, {"page": "1884\u201385 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Joseph Lindsay (3), Robert Calderwood (2), William Anderson (2), David Allan"]}]}}
