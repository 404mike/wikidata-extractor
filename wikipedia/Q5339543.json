Bramley, which marked an important stage in the revival of the Christmas carol. The book includes Stainer's arrangements of what were to become the standard versions of \"What Child Is This\", \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\", \"Good King Wenceslas\", \"The First Nowell\", and \"I Saw Three Ships\", among others. He was a skilled musician and accompanist and Walter Galpin Alcock, who was taught composition by Arthur Sullivan at the National Training School for Music, recalls Sullivan saying \"I was at St Paul's yesterday, listening to Dr Stainer extemporising.
