While at Columbia University, Corfield wrote the original version of the desktop publishing application FrameMaker, which was the main product of the company he soon co-founded. An undergraduate at St John's College, Cambridge, he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Cambridge in 1982. In 1996 he donated \u00a32.5m to help fund Cambridge University's Centre for Mathematical Sciences. The Sunday Times Rich List estimates his wealth at over \u00a3100m.\nHe is also a mountain climber, having summitted Mount Everest and conducted studies of the effects of high altitude on human physiology.\nCorfield is also an ultrarunner. In 2007, he was third in the Leadville Trail 100, one of the hardest runs in the United States, achieving a time of 19 hours and 42 minutes in his first ever 100-mile run.\nIn 2009, St John's College, Cambridge opened Corfield Court, named in recognition of the significant donations Corfield had made to the College over the years.\nA species of lizard, Luperosaurus corfieldi, is named in honour of Corfield.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St John's College, Cambridge", "response": ["Located directly opposite the college's Great Gate is All Saints' Yard. The complex is formed from the buildings of the so-called \"Triangle Site\", a collection of structures owned by the college. An extensive renovation project finished in Michaelmas Term 2012 had a budget of approximately \u00a39.75 million. The centrepiece of the Yard is Corfield Court, named after the project's chief benefactor, Charles Corfield. The site can be entered through one of two card-activated gates, or through the School of Divinity. The School of Divinity is the largest building on the site, and was built between 1878 and 1879 by Basil Champneys for the University of Cambridge's divinity faculty on land leased by St John's College. Control of the building reverted to St John's when the faculty of divinity moved to a new building on the Sidgwick site in 2000."]}, {"page": "Nick Corfield", "response": ["#REDIRECTCharles Corfield"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of St John's College, Cambridge", "response": ["*Charles Corfield, founder of Frame Technology Corporation"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of St John's College, Cambridge", "response": ["*Charles Corfield"]}, {"page": "Corfield", "response": ["*Charles Corfield, British mathematician"]}, {"page": "Corfield, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Corfield"]}]}}
