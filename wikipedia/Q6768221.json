While his brothers moved toward country music to modest success, Donny was able to revive his career in popular music. He made an unlikely appearance as one of several celebrities and unknowns auditioning to sing for guitarist Jeff Beck in the video for Beck's 1985 single \"Ambitious\" \u2013 which was produced by Paul Flattery and directed by Jim Yukich \u2013 followed in 1986 by an equally unlikely cameo in the animated Luis Cardenas music video \"Runaway\". He spent several years as a performer, before hiring the services of music and entertainment guru Steven Machat, who got Osmond together with English singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel to see whether Machat and Gabriel could turn the TV Osmond's image into a contemporary young pop act.  They succeeded, returning Osmond to the US charts in 1989 with the Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 song \"Soldier of Love\" (originally announced on radio stations as \"from a mystery singer\") and its top twenty follow-up \"Sacred Emotion\". Launching an extensive tour in support of the Eyes Don't Lie record, he enlisted Earth Wind & Fire and Kenny Loggins guitarist Dick Smith along with keyboardist Mark Jackson."]}, {"page": "Mark Jackson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Mark Jackson (born 1965) is an American former basketball guard and former head coach of the Golden State Warriors.", "*Mark Jackson (R&B musician), American musician, member of the 1950s R&B group The Crows", "*Mark Jackson (musician) (born 1970), English musician, member of VNV Nation", "*Mark Jackson (actor) (born 1982), English actor known for his appearance as Isaac on The Orville", "*Mark Jackson (quarterback) (born 1954), American football player", "*Mark Jackson (wide receiver) (born 1963), American football player", "*Mark Jackson (athletic director) (born 1972), American football coach/administrator", "*Mark Jackson (Australian footballer) (born 1959), Australian rules footballer and actor", "*Mark Jackson (hurdler) (born 1969), Canadian track and field athlete", "*Mark Jackson (footballer, born 1977), English footballer", "*Mark Jackson (speed skater) (born 1980), New Zealand Olympic speed skater", "*Mark Jackson (curator) (born 1976), American British curator"]}, {"page": "Ronan Harris", "response": ["In 1988, Harris moved from Dublin, Ireland to London, England.
