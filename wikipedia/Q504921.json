After serving in the Anglo-Zulu War he established an early reputation as a pioneer of ship-to-ship wireless technology. Later he became the first person to achieve ship-to-ship wireless communications and demonstrated continuous communication with another vessel up to three miles away. He went on to be Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy, then Director of the Royal Naval War College and subsequently Chief of the Admiralty War Staff. He was advisor on overseas expeditions planning attacks on Germany's colonial possessions at the start of the First World War and was selected as the surprise successor to Admiral Lord Fisher upon the latter's spectacular resignation in May 1915 following the failure of the Gallipoli Campaign. He had a cordial working relationship with First Lord of the Admiralty (and former Prime Minister) Arthur Balfour, but largely concerned himself with administrative matters and his prestige suffered when German destroyers appeared in the Channel, as a result of which he was replaced in December 1916.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1855", "response": ["**Henry Jackson, British admiral (d. 1929)"]}, {"page": "Henry Jackson", "response": ["Henry Jackson may refer to:", "* Henry Jackson (Continental Army general) (1747\u20131809), American colonial leader", "* Henry Jackson (Royal Navy officer) (1855\u20131929), British First Sea Lord", "* Henry Jackson (British Army officer) (1879\u20131972), British Army General", "* Henry Jackson (Minnesota pioneer) (1811\u20131857), American pioneer and legislator", "* Henry Jackson (New Zealand politician) (1830\u20131906), New Zealand politician", "* Sir Henry Jackson, 2nd Baronet (1831\u20131881), British MP for Coventry", "* Henry Jackson (colonial administrator) (1849\u20131908), British colonial administrator", "* Sir Henry Jackson, 1st Baronet (1875\u20131937), British Conservative MP for Wandsworth Central", "** Henry Jackson Society, British conservative think tank", "* Henry Jackson (football manager) (c. 1850\u20131930), English football secretary-manager and director", "* Henry Jackson (baseball) (1861\u20131932), Major League Baseball player", "* Henry Jackson (Australian footballer) (1877\u20131964), Australian rules footballer", "* Henry Jackson (athlete), Jamaican Olympic long jumper", "* Henry Jackson (priest) (1586\u20131662), English priest and literary editor", "* Henry Jackson (classicist) (1839\u20131921), English classicist", "* Henry Jackson (businessman) (born 1964)", "* Henry Jackson (1956\u20132014), rapper Big Bank Hank"]}, {"page": "Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)", "response": ["|  ||100px|| Jackson HenrySir Henry Jackson  || 1855 || 1929 || First Sea Lord 1915\u20131916 ||"]}, {"page": "Controller of the Navy (Royal Navy)", "response": ["* Rear-Admiral Sir Henry Jackson, 1905\u20131908"]}, {"page": "HMS Iron Duke (1912)", "response": ["The Grand Fleet conducted a sweep into the central North Sea on 17\u201319 May without encountering any German vessels.Jellicoe, p. 217 On 25 May, Iron Duke carried Jellicoe to Rosyth to meet with Admiral Henry Jackson, the new First Sea Lord.
