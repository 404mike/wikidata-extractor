He enjoyed some success with Celtic, winning the Coronation Cup in 1953 and a Scottish league and Scottish Cup double in 1954.

Stein started his managerial career in 1960 with Dunfermline, where he won the Scottish Cup in 1961 and achieved some notable results in European football. After a brief but successful spell at Hibernian, Stein returned to Celtic as manager in March 1965.

Johnstone went on to produce an outstanding performance, scoring twice and providing assists for the other three goals in a 5\u20131 win. He helped Celtic reach a further European Cup Final in season 1969\u201370. His performance in the second leg of the semi-final against Leeds United at Hampden Park was particularly outstanding, and his mazy run in the second half set up Bobby Murdoch to score with a powerful shot for Celtic's winning goal in a 2\u20131 victory on the night. Leeds' defender Terry Cooper later quipped \"I would love to have kicked Jinky, but I couldn't get near him!\" Billy Bremner described Johnstone's performance as \"one of the greatest exhibitions I have ever seen\", adding that \"Jimmy had one of these games where he was unstoppable.\" Celtic played Feyenoord in the final but, with Johnstone double-marked at all times, Celtic were unable to perform as they had in the 1967 final. Feyenoord dominated the match and defeated Celtic 2\u20131 after extra-time."]}, {"page": "1922 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 5 October \u2013 Jock Stein, footballer and manager of Scotland (died 1985)"]}]}}
