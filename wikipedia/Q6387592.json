He played in fifteen Tests from 1934 to 1939.Farnes was born in Leytonstone, Essex, and was educated at the Royal Liberty School in Gidea Park. He made his first-class debut for Essex in 1930, aged only 19. He took 5\u201336 in his second county match against Kent. He studied at Pembroke College, Cambridge, playing cricket in the University side for three years while also continuing to play for Essex. After graduating, he became a teacher at Worksop College, which limited his opportunity to play for Essex.\nFarnes was reduced to tears in 1932, playing against Yorkshire at Scarborough. Earlier that year, playing at Leyton, Yorkshire had beaten Essex by an innings and 313 runs. Farnes reinforced Essex for the return match. Bowling as fast as he could, he conceded 75 runs to Herbert Sutcliffe and Maurice Leyland in 4 overs, and Essex lost again by an innings and 8 runs.\nIn 1933, he took 41 wickets for Cambridge at a bowling average of 17.39 runs; in all, he took 113 wickets at an average of 18.38 that year. He was called up for the 1st Test against Australia in 1934, at Trent Bridge, taking 5-102 and 5-77, although England lost by 238 runs. He also played in the 2nd Test at Lord's, but was then injured, missing the next two Tests and only playing again towards the end of the season.\nAfter two further Tests on the tour to the West Indies in 1934/35, an injury to his knee prevented him from playing in 1935. The next season, playing for the Gentlemen against the Players, he took three quick wickets, bowling Gimblett, Hammond and Hardstaff, to leave the Players at 33\u20134. Although rain intervened, so the match was drawn, Gubby Allen selected him for the tour to Australia that winter, where he played in the 4th and 5th Tests. His 6\u201396 in the 5th Test at the MCG could not prevent Australia scoring 604 in their first innings, and so winning the match by an innings and 200 to take the series 3\u20132.In 1938, Farnes bowled the Gentlemen to their second victory against the Players since 1918, taking 8-43 and 3-60, and he returned to the Test side for 4 Tests against Australia in 1938, and he toured South Africa that winter, opening the bowling in five Tests with Hedley Verity.\nA tall man of 6'5\", and widely recognised for his fitness, he achieved considerable pace from a short run-up, and sharp lift from a good length. His height also enabled him to take many sharp catches close to the stumps. He was a confirmed tail-ender as a batsman. He achieved his highest first-class score of 97 not out against Somerset at Taunton in 1936, putting on 149 for the tenth wicket and just missing out on his century.\nHe was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1939, and published an autobiography, Tours and Tests in 1940.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 8", "response": ["*1911 \u2013 Ken Farnes, English cricketer (d. 1941)"]}, {"page": "Bodyline", "response": ["Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the 1932 season with varying but increasing success and several injuries to batsmen.Frith, pp. 45\u201348.Douglas, pp. 113\u2013117.

After appearing in a trial match, Verity played in all four Tests against Australia, during a series which was tied 1\u20131. In the first match, England scored 658 and according to Wisden, the new England captain Wally Hammond decided to keep Verity in reserve in the expectation of making Australia follow-on; he bowled just 45\u00a0balls in Australia's first innings. Australia did follow-on, and in the second innings, Verity bowled 62\u00a0overs to take three wickets for 102, bowling very accurately, but the batsmen played him skilfully and the match was drawn. In the second match, Verity took four for 103 out of an Australian total of 422, in reply to England's\u00a0494. After Verity had taken two wickets in eight balls, Australia were in danger of having to follow-on, but Bill O'Reilly struck him for two consecutive sixes to remove the possibility. Verity took two wickets in the second innings, but the match was drawn. After the third match was abandoned owing to rain, Australia won the fourth Test, held at Headingley, by five wickets to ensure the Ashes were retained. Wisden commented that: \"At no time was the wicket easy for batting and Australia won largely because they possessed better spin bowling.\" Verity took two wickets in the match, but some critics believed his bowling could have won the match had Hammond used him more effectively.  In a match where the Australian spinner O'Reilly took 10 wickets, Hammond used his fast bowlers Bowes and Ken Farnes for the majority of both innings. Commentators believed Hammond over-used his fast bowlers; Cardus wrote: \"Hammond's faith in fast bowling rather exceeded his faith in the arts of Verity and Wright. The result was sad disillusionment.\" Barnett also said that Hammond refused to allow Verity to alter his bowling tactics, when the Yorkshire bowler wished to aim for a worn area on the pitch.Hill, p. 116."]}, {"page": "Essex County Cricket Club", "response": ["With the decline of these players, Essex fell to some of their lowest levels ever during the late 1920s. Their bowlers conceded over 40 runs a wicket in 1928 \u2013 about the highest ever with uncovered pitches. The emergence of Jack O'Connor, Stan Nichols and when available, the amateur fast bowlers Ken Farnes and Hopper Read, though, made Essex during the 1930s a dangerous if inconsistent side. They finished as high as fourth in 1933, and owing to their pace bowling maintained almost as high a standard up to the outbreak of war. The batting, however, tended to depend too much upon O'Connor and a number of amateurs who were rarely available, and Essex lost too many games to break the North's stronghold on the Championship.", "* Ken Farnes"]}, {"page": "Hugh Bartlett", "response": ["Later at Lord's, Bartlett made 175 not out in his first appearance for Gentlemen against the Players. One six off Morris Nichols deposited the ball in a grandstand turret. He hit Nichols for five fours in an over, Peter Smith for two fours and two sixes off another.Bartlett scored two sixes and four fours in a single over from Smith, according to some sources. In all, he hit 24 fours and four sixes in 165 minutes. His last 75 runs came in 46 minutes; with last man Ken Farnes (10), he added 82 in 45 minutes. \"I do not recall\", wrote the Cricketer correspondent, \"even Jessop treating professional bowling quite so roughly as he did in this innings\"."]}, {"page": "Stan McCabe", "response": ["McCabe's most highly rated innings came in the First Test at Trent Bridge. England compiled 8/658 before declaring late on the second day, and McCabe had toiled for 21 overs without success. McCabe arrived at the crease with the dismissal of Bradman at 2/111 to join Brown, and after two unsuccessful appeals against the light, he was 19 at the close of play after 35 minutes of batting with the total at 3/138, having seen Brown dismissed for 48. McCabe had struck three boundaries by this stage, two cut shots and an on drive, and had survived a final spell from fast bowler Ken Farnes without a sightscreen, accompanied by nightwatchman Frank Ward.McHarg, p. 52."]}, {"page": "Maurice Leyland", "response": ["At the beginning of the 1932 season, Leyland continued to struggle. Although he was chosen in two Test trial matches and scored 189 against Middlesex, he was left out of the England team for the only Test of the summer, and had little success in the first three months of the season. However, in August he made 1,013 runs at 84.14, scoring four centuries and two innings over 90. During this spell, Leyland shared a partnership of 149 runs in 55 minutes with Herbert Sutcliffe against Essex. That county had chosen two fast bowlers in an attempt to intimidate the Yorkshire batsmen. Ken Farnes and Morris Nichols bowled a succession of bouncers; Farnes attempted fast leg theory bowling, a tactic which developed into Bodyline during the MCC tour of Australia in 1932\u201333.Frith, p. 49. Eventually, Sutcliffe began to hook the short ball and in six successive overs, he and Leyland added 102 runs, an unusually fast rate of scoring. Leyland faced little of the bowling, later remembering that he received only four deliveries in this period, hitting each for four. In total, he contributed only 45 runs to the partnership.Hill, p. 136. Farnes was reduced to tears by the assault on his bowling,Hill, p. 137. and these events possibly persuaded the MCC selectors to leave him out of the team for the 1932\u201333 tour. Leyland, on the other hand, was among the last names added to the touring party in mid-August. At the end of the season, he scored 105 against the Rest of England for Yorkshire, his team playing as County Champions. In total, he scored 1,980 runs at 52.10 and took 23 wickets at 20.86."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Ken Farnes \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Laurie Nash", "response": ["Nash claimed 4/70 and 1/34 and scored a sedate 17 in seventy-five minutes (disappointing the crowd which \"was expecting fireworks from him\") as Australia clinched the series.

On a good pitch, Read\u2019s speed caused him to carry all before him with seven wickets for 35. Although his training as a chartered accountant made his appearances limited, he still took 69 wickets at an average better than any fast bowler except Larwood and his Essex compatriot Ken Farnes. For the Gentlemen against the Players at Folkestone in September Read took in two innings nine wickets for 171 runs, and Wisden opined that Read was the \u201cfind of the season\u201d.Southerton, Sydney J.

In an early match for Burnley, against Church, he took nine wickets in an innings and spoiled his own record by catching the tenth batsman off a different bowler.
