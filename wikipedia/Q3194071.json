She later played the charwoman Mrs. Dilber opposite Alastair Sim in the 1951 film Scrooge (US: A Christmas Carol, 1951) and a Cockney charwoman who inherits a fortune in the television series Mrs Thursday (1966\u201367).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 7", "response": ["*1995 \u2013 Kathleen Harrison, English actress (b. 1892)"]}, {"page": "February 23", "response": ["*1892 \u2013 Kathleen Harrison, English actress (d. 1995)"]}, {"page": "1892", "response": ["**Kathleen Harrison, English actress (d. 1995)"]}, {"page": "Richard Burton", "response": ["Pleased with the feedback Burton received for his performance in The Last Days of Dolwyn, the film's co-producer Alexander Korda offered him a contract at a stipend of \u00a3100 a week (), which he signed. The contract enabled Korda to lend Burton to films produced by other companies. Throughout the late 1940s and early 50s, Burton acted in small parts in various British films such as Now Barabbas (1949) with Richard Greene and Kathleen Harrison, The Woman with No Name (1950) opposite Phyllis Calvert, and Waterfront (1950) with Harrison. Burton had a bigger part as Robert Hammond, a spy for a newspaper editor in Green Grow the Rushes (1951) alongside Honor Blackman. His performance in Now Barabbas received positive feedback from critics. C. A. Lejeune of The Observer believed Burton had \"all the qualities of a leading man that the British film industry badly needs at this juncture: youth, good looks, a photogenic face, obviously alert intelligence and a trick of getting the maximum effort with the minimum of fuss.\" For The Woman With No Name, a critic from The New York Times thought Burton \"merely adequate\" in his role of the Norwegian aviator, Nick Chamerd. Biographer Bragg states the reviews for Burton's performance in Waterfront were \"not bad\", and that Green Grow the Rushes was a box office bomb."]}, {"page": "Night Must Fall", "response": ["* Kathleen Harrison ...
