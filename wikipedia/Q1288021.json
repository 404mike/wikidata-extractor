His parents were Richard Thomas Burney (1768\u20131808), headmaster of the Orphan School at Kidderpore, and Jane Burney (1772\u20131842), and he was a nephew of the English writer Frances Burney (1752\u20131840). On 30 June 1818 at St. George's Church in George Town, Penang, Malaya, he married Janet Bannerman (1799\u20131865), with whom he had 13 children, eight of whom were still living at the time of his death. She was the niece of John Alexander Bannerman, who was governor of Penang in Malaya.Henry Burney died at sea in 1845 and was buried in Mission Burial Ground on Park Street in Calcutta.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Thailand", "response": ["There was a serious touch with British colonial interests when Siam conquered the Sultanate Kedah on the Malay Peninsula in 1821. Kedah belonged to the sphere of interest of Great Britain. In the following year, Siam had to recognise the pre-conquest status after tough negotiations with the British envoy John Crawfurd. There was also the cautious resumption of trade and missionary activity in this epoch. In particular, British traders such as Robert Hunter (\"discoverer\" of the conjoined brothers Chang and Eng, the original \"Siamese twins\") or James Hayes, but also missionaries from Europe and the United States like Jacob Tomlin, Karl G\u00fctzlaff, Dan Beach Bradley and Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix became active in Siam. In 1825 an agreement was signed with British emissary Henry Burney; Siam recognised British colonial possessions on the Malay Peninsula and made commercial concessions. This agreement was due not least to the rapid British success in the First Anglo-Burmese War."]}, {"page": "Foreign relations of Thailand", "response": ["After Burma lost the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824\u201326) relations opened between the Rattanakosin Kingdom of Siam and the United Kingdom with a treaty of alliance in February 1826 and another treaty in June negotiated by East India Company emissary Henry Burney. This was followed by the Bowring Treaty of 1855 to liberalise trade. In 1893, Lord Lansdowne of the British Raj finalized the border between Burma and Siam; the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 then dissected the northern Malay states."]}, {"page": "1820s", "response": ["* 1824\u20131826 - Rattanakosin Kingdom (Siam): Rama II died in 1824 and was peacefully succeeded by his son Jessadabodindra (Rama III). In 1825 the British sent another mission to Bangkok led by East India Company emissary Henry Burney. They had by now annexed southern Burma and were thus Siam's neighbours to the west, and they were also extending their control over Malaya. The King was reluctant to give in to British demands, but his advisors warned him that Siam would meet the same fate as Burma unless the British were accommodated. In 1826, therefore, Siam concluded its first commercial treaty with a western power, the Burney Treaty. Under the treaty, Siam agreed to establish a uniform taxation system, to reduce taxes on foreign trade and to abolish some of the royal monopolies. As a result, Siam's trade increased rapidly, many more foreigners settled in Bangkok, and western cultural influences began to spread. The kingdom became wealthier and its army better armed."]}, {"page": "Perak", "response": ["In 1826, the Kingdom of Ligor broke its promise and attempted to conquer Perak. A small British expeditionary force thwarted the attack. The Sultan of Perak then ceded to the British the area of Dindings and Pangkor (the two now constitute Manjung District) so that the British could suppress pirate activity along the Perak coast where it became part of the Straits Settlements. The same year, the British and Siam concluded a new treaty. Under the Burney Treaty, signed by British Captain Henry Burney and the Siamese government, the British undertook not to intercede in the affairs of Kedah despite their friendly relations with Kedah's ruler, and the Siamese undertook not to attack either Perak or Selangor."]}, {"page": "Rama III", "response": ["In 1825, Henry Burney arrived to negotiate peace agreements.

The Fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 was the final blow as most Siamese were either deported to Burma or perished in war. The manpower shortage of Siam was exemplified during the Nine Armies' War in 1785, in which Burma sent the total number of 144,000 men to invade Siam who managed to only gather 70,000 men for defenses. D.E. Malloch, who accompanied Henry Burney to Bangkok in 1826, noted that Siam was thinly populated and the Siamese lands could support about twice the size of its population.", "By the reign of King Rama II, however, the Samphao Luang or Royal Junks became less profitable due to competition with growing private sectors. Since the Ayutthaya Period in the sixteenth century, the Siamese royal court had monopolized foreign trades through the Phra Khlang Sinkha or Royal Warehouse. All incoming foreign ships including European merchants should go through the inspection by the officials of Phra Khlang Sinkha who collected the Phasi Pak Reua or ship-width tariff and bought goods. Foreign merchants could only trade through the Phra Khlang Sinkha and could not trade directly with the private Siamese. The ship-width tariff had been a major source of revenue to royal court. When the British arrived in the 1820s, they saw traditional royal monopoly as a hindrance and implied that free trade should be the better agreement. This culminated in the arrival of Henry Burney and the promulgation of the Burney Treaty in June 1826, which ended three centuries of royal monopoly by granting the rights to the British to trade privately. However, some trade restrictions remained. Rice and ammunition were not permitted to be traded freely and the ship-width tariffs continued to be collected. It took about another thirty years for the Siamese economy to be fully liberalized in the Bowring Treaty of 1855."]}, {"page": "Burney Treaty", "response": ["The treaty between Kingdom of Siam and Great Britain commonly known as the Burney Treaty was signed at Bangkok on 20 June 1826 by Henry Burney, an agent of British East India Company, for Britain, and King Rama III for Siam.
