While in jail in Annapolis, Ayuba was visited by Thomas Bluett. Thomas became impressed with him and, through another slave acting as interpreter, wrote Ayuba's biography \"Some Memoirs of the Life of Job, the Son of Solomon, the High Priest of Boonda in Africa; Who was a Slave About Two Years in Maryland; and Afterwards Being Brought to England, was Set Free, and Sent to His Native Land in the Year 1734\", which was published in London 1734. Bluett died in 1749.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ayuba Suleiman Diallo", "response": ["Ayuba Suleiman Diallo (17011773), also known as Job Ben Solomon, was a prominent Fulani Muslim prince from West Africa who was kidnapped to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade, having previously sold slaves himself. Born in Bundu, Senegal (West Africa), Ayuba's memoirs were published as one of the earliest slave narratives, in Thomas Bluett's Some Memories of the Life of Job, the Son of the Solomon High Priest of Boonda in Africa; Who was enslaved about two Years in Maryland; and afterwards being brought to England, was set free, and sent to his native Land in the Year 1734. However, this version is not a first-person account. A first-hand account of Ayuba's capture by Mandinkas and eventual return home can be found in Francis Moore's Travels into the Inland Parts of Africa.", "Ayuba was then purchased by Mr Tolsey of Kent Island, Maryland. Ayuba was initially put to work in the tobacco fields; however, after being found unsuitable for such work, he was placed in charge of the cattle. While in captivity, Ayuba used to go into the woods to pray. However, after being humiliated by a child while praying, Ayuba ran away in 1731 and was captured and imprisoned at the Kent County Courthouse. Unfortunately, Ayuba's rationale for escape was not understood until an African translator was located. Able to communicate his needs, Ayuba's owner set aside an area for undisturbed prayer upon the slave's return. It was at the courthouse that he was discovered by a lawyer and Anglican priest, Thomas Bluett of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, travelling through on business."]}, {"page": "Template talk:Speakers of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives", "response": ["== Thomas Bluett ==", "Thomas Bluett, Speaker 1925-1927, is obviously not the Thomas Bluett (c. 1690 \u2013 1749) with the link on this template.
