Various figures estimate the number of civilian deaths at between 30,000 and 100,000 killed and possibly over 200,000 injured, while more than 500,000 people were displaced by the conflict, which left cities and villages across the republic in ruins. The conflict led to a significant decrease of non-Chechen population due to violence and discrimination.Unity Or Separation: Center-periphery Relations in the Former Soviet Union By Daniel R.

Two professional actors were paid to appear, Sebastian Smith as the soldier, and his wife Lindsay Gray as the old woman who stole the baby. The two actors were paid half a guinea each; Hepworth would recall \"We couldn't get them for less\". The film is often cited as the first film to have used paid actors.
