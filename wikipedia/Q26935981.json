The Saints went a goal up within six minutes, when Charlie Austin scored a penalty awarded for a foul by Curtis Davies. The visitors continued to dominate throughout the rest of the first half and into the second, although the hosts equalised through Robert Snodgrass in the 61st minute. Within two minutes, Hull went 2\u20131 through Michael Dawson, holding on for an unlikely win. On 19 November, the club returned from another international break to face Liverpool at St Mary's, which ended in a goalless draw. Former Saints winger Sadio Man\u00e9 came close to opening the scoring for the visitors twice in the first half, before Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Nathaniel Clyne also missed good chances later on, with the home side's defence playing strongly to keep Liverpool out. The following week, Southampton beat Everton (managed by former Saints boss Ronald Koeman) by a single early goal to return to tenth in the league table. Charlie Austin scored in the first minute to put the hosts ahead, converting a cross from debutant Josh Sims. Southampton continued to dominate possession and chances on goal throughout the match, with James Ward-Prowse coming closest to doubling his side's lead in the second half.", "|align=\"left\"|Josh Sims"]}, {"page": "All-time New York Red Bulls goalscorers", "response": ["|Josh Sims"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["Southampton picked up their first win in 13 games on 3 February 2018, beating bottom side West Bromwich Albion 3\u20132. The Baggies opened the scoring within five minutes when Ahmed Hegazi headed in a corner from Chris Brunt, but the Saints increased the pressure and dominated much of the rest of the first half. Shortly before the break, Mario Lemina scored his first goal for the club from outside the penalty area and Jack Stephens scored his third goal in as many games to put the visitors ahead. Ten minutes into the second half, James Ward-Prowse added a third from a free-kick, before Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n pulled back a second for the hosts later on. The following week, the Saints hosted Liverpool and lost 2\u20130. Roberto Firmino opened the scoring in the sixth minute, after being set up by Mohamed Salah. The hosts came close to equalising on a number of occasions, but it was the visitors who struck again just before half-time, as Salah scored a goal of his own. On 24 February, Southampton drew 1\u20131 with Burnley at Turf Moor. Neither side mounted many challenges on goal in the first half, with the hosts opening the scoring 20 minutes into the second half courtesy of Ashley Barnes. The Saints almost scored through substitute Josh Sims but for a save by Nick Pope, before Manolo Gabbiadini scored his first goal since October in the final minute of the game to save a point for the visitors and keep them out of the relegation zone.", "On 3 March, Southampton were held to a goalless draw by Stoke City at home, dropping to 17th in the table as a result. The visitors came close to scoring at the end of the first half through Badou Ndiaye, with goalkeeper Alex McCarthy making a save from his header. The hosts had a number of chances in the second half through Josh Sims, C\u00e9dric Soares and substitute Sofiane Boufal, but were unable to convert and were held at 0\u20130.  The following week, on 10 March,  Southampton lost 3\u20130 to Newcastle United at St James' Park. Brazilian loanee Kenedy opened the scoring for the hosts within the minute of play, and scored a second in the 29th minute to double Newcastle's advantage. The visitors offered little goal threat, with only two shots on target from the Saints in the second half. Matt Ritchie scored a third for the home side after 57 minutes, wrapping up the three points in convincing style and condemning Southampton to yet another defeat. It would spell the end of Mauricio Pellegrino's tenure as Southampton manager, as he was sacked on 12 March with the club one point above the relegation zone and having won just once in 17 matches.
