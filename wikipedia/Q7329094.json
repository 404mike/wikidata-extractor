He lost his first match in charge, 2\u20131 against Bristol City, but followed this with wins against Crystal Palace and Scunthorpe. Mowbray guided Boro to Championship safety, having joined the club when they were 22nd in the league. The club finished the season well, winning their last four league games and finished 12th in the league table. The same season, Mowbray started giving youngsters a first team place such as Joe Bennett, Luke Williams and Richard Smallwood. Mowbray also started giving Marvin Emnes more playing time after returning on loan from Swansea City."]}, {"page": "Dean Whitehead", "response": ["In the 2014\u201315 season, Whitehead continued to feature in the first-team at the start of the season, mostly coming on as a substitute. This was due to added competition for the defensive midfield position with Richard Smallwood, Grant Leadbitter and Adam Clayton. However, in a 4\u20130 win over Brentford on 20 September, he was sent\u2013off \"for an over the top tackle\", leading the referee giving him a straight red card. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the first-team from suspension, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2\u20130 win over Fulham on 2 October. Whitehead captained the side for the first time in the league, in a 1\u20131 draw against Watford on 25 October. However, throughout the 2014\u201315 season, Whitehead was demoted to the substitute bench. But he did provide cover, playing twice at right\u2013back and six times in central midfield. He also captained the side once again this season against Sheffield Wednesday on 28 February, which ended in a 2\u20130 defeat. In the Championship play-offs, Whitehead was featured three times as a right\u2013back, including the play-off final at Wembley, where they lost 2\u20130 to Norwich City. Whitehead made twenty\u2013five appearances in all competitions. At the end of the season, Whitehead left Middlesbrough as manager Aitor Karanka could not guarantee him game time."]}, {"page": "Smallwood", "response": ["* Richard Smallwood (born 1948), American gospel music artist", "* Richard Smallwood (born 1990), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Richard Smallwood", "response": ["Richard Smallwood (born November 30, 1948 in Atlanta, Georgia) is an American gospel artist who formed The Richard Smallwood Singers in 1977 in Washington, DC.", "Richard Smallwood graduated cum laude from Howard University with degrees in both vocal performance and piano, in addition to graduate work in the field of ethnomusicology.
