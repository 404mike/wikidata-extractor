A centre-forward, he scored 114 goals in 239 league and cup appearances in a nine-year career in the Football League.\nHe began his career at Everton in May 1956, and played eleven top-flight games before moving on to Crewe Alexandra in July 1958. He proved a prolific signing, hitting 51 goals in 96 league games, before he was sold on to Port Vale for a \u00a37,000 fee in November 1960. He was sold to Northampton Town for \u00a37,000 in February 1963, but soon found himself without a club after breaking his leg 11 minutes into his \"Cobblers\" debut. He returned to the game with Walsall in February 1964, before he signed with Cheshire County League side Wigan Athletic in summer 1965.
