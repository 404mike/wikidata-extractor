The play co-starred former Doctor Who companion Wendy Padbury (playing a different character named Jenny). Also in the cast was Simon Jones as the \"Master of Karn\", several years before he worked with Doctor Who writer Douglas Adams on The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

The Doctor would have realised the truth about them when Victoria called Lethbridge-Stewart \"Brigadier\", when she only knew him as a Colonel (in The Web of Fear).
