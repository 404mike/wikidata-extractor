He worked briefly outside motor racing before joining the Williams team in 1977.  There he became one of many young engineers to have worked alongside Patrick Head early in their careers before moving on to other organisations.  Oatley worked as a draughtsman before becoming a race engineer for both Clay Regazzoni and Carlos Reutemann.\nIn 1984 Oatley was recruited by Carl Haas to work on the FORCE F1 project, but the results were poor, and the team withdrew from Formula One in 1986.\nOatley joined the McLaren team shortly after leaving FORCE and worked alongside John Barnard in the design office. After Gordon Murray replaced Barnard as technical director, Oatley was put in charge of the design of the naturally aspirated car for 1989\u2014Steve Nichols having been appointed chief designer of the   1988 chassis\u2014and remained chief designer after Murray moved to the new McLaren road car project. His cars secured titles in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1998 and 1999.\nOatley continued to work as chief designer at McLaren until 2003, when he became executive director of engineering.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cosworth", "response": ["The GBA engine was first road tested by Haas Lola's lead driver,  World Champion Alan Jones in the new Lola THL2 at the Boreham Circuit in Essex just north-east of London on 21 February 1986.

In the Constructors' Championship McLaren's points score of 199 was (at that time) an all-time high. Murray also played a small part in the design of the 1989 MP4/5 and 1990 MP4/5B along with Nichols and Neil Oatley.

Alan Jones was tempted out of retirement to drive it in F1 races towards the end of the 1985 season, with Patrick Tambay joining in a second car for 1986. A works Ford-Cosworth turbocharged engine was promised, but this did not materialise until 1986 and old Hart four-cylinder units were used. Car, engine, drivers and sponsors were all troublesome and the team folded after the 1986 season with most of its assets (including the factory) being sold to Bernie Ecclestone. At one point during the season, Ecclestone informed the Haas Lola team that \"his driver\" (Patrese) would be in the car at the next meeting; Ecclestone was primarily interested in acquiring the Ford engines as a replacement for the BMW units in his Brabhams but the manufacturer vetoed this, offering the engines to Benetton instead.
