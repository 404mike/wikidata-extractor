After lunch he asked to be driven to the Garrick Club for further refreshment, and then returned to his Kensington (Lexham  Gardens) home. He and his wife later went out to dinner. On their return, Nimmo was checking an external alarm when he lost his footing and fell down a stone staircase into the basement.
