Both of the two founders became bishops in the Church of England. Charles Gore was Bishop of Worcester (1902\u201305), Birmingham (1905\u201311) and Oxford (1911\u201319), and Walter Howard Frere became Bishop of Truro (1923\u201335). Timothy Rees became Bishop of Llandaff (1931\u201339) in Wales, and Thomas Hannay became Bishop of Argyll and The Isles in Scotland (1942\u201362), and Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church from 1952 to his retirement in 1962.", "Most of the bishops of CR have been connected to the Anglican expansion through mission work outside Great Britain. The third bishop of the six founders, James Okey Nash, became coadjutor bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Cape Town from 1917 to 1930. Nash was the first in a row of CR bishops in Africa. A native born South African, Simeon Nkoane, became Desmond Tutu's assistant bishop in the Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg from 1982 to his death in 1989. Robert Mercer was Bishop of Matabeleland in Zimbabwe from 1977 to 1989. He then became a bishop of a Continuing Anglican church, the Anglican Catholic Church of Canada, from 1989 to 2005 and later joined the Anglican-tradition Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham within the Roman Catholic Church in 2012, remaining, however, an external member of CR. Two CR brethren eventually reached archiepiscopal status: Thomas Hannay in Scotland and Trevor Huddleston, Archbishop of the Anglican Church of the Province of the Indian Ocean from 1978 to 1983. Before that he was bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Masasi in Tanzania (1960\u201368), the suffragan Bishop of Stepney in the Diocese of London (1968\u201378) and bishop of the Diocese of Mauritius in 1978."]}, {"page": "College of the Resurrection", "response": ["* Thomas Hannay \u2013 Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church"]}, {"page": "Hannay", "response": ["* Thomas Hannay (1887-1970), British Anglican bishop"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of Queens' College, Cambridge", "response": ["* Thomas Hannay"]}, {"page": "Hannay, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Hannay"]}]}}
