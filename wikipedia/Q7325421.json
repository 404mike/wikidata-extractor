Her first trial to test a nitrate drug against placebo was published in 2004 and had positive findings. Jamal's most famous study, a paper on the use of nitroglycerin in osteoporosis, was published in 2011 with collaborators Cummings and Richard Eastell. The study claimed to find that nitroglycerin was a safe and effective treatment of and preventative for osteoporosis, increasing the bone density of elderly women in the most vulnerable skeletal regions to the disease. Due to the potentially dangerous side effects of common osteoporosis treatments, Jamal's findings were hailed as impressive progress in the field, drawing the attention of major medical establishments such as the Mayo Clinic. As a result of the attention, Jamal was granted nearly  to fund a follow-up study in 2012. She was also awarded the 2012 CSEM Young Investigator Award, a  grant from the Canadian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism.", "The additional scrutiny brought upon Jamal's 2011 paper by the follow-up study revealed inconsistencies between the results and her presentation of them. Jamal's collaborator Richard Eastell found discrepancies between the raw data and her descriptions in reports she sent him. When Eastell conducted his own statistical analysis in 2014, he found no difference between the treatment and placebo groups. When questioned about the discrepancies, Jamal blamed a research assistant for inaccurately presenting the data. She later took to physical measures to try cover up the fraud; Jamal changed files in patient records, destroyed an old computer of hers to prevent fraud investigators from accessing it, and modified the temperature controls to destroy blood and urine specimens stored at Canadian Blood Services and prevent their analysis."]}]}}
