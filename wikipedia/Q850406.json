She began playing the saxophone at the age of nine and left school six years later to perform with the travelling all-female septet Archie's Juveniles. She performed in the Middle East in 1947 and flew to Germany the following year. Smith and her husband Jack Peberdy joined Freddy Randall's band in 1950 before leaving seven years later to form their own quintet. Her time with Randall saw her travel the United States with some success in the country's hit parade. Her newly formed quintet found regular work and Smith later performed with the Ted Heath Orchestra and alongside Kenny Baker. Her career ended in 1985 and did not recover sufficiently to resume performing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Parnell", "response": ["In the 1970s, he had co-founded the group The Best of British Jazz with Kenny Baker, Don Lusher, Betty Smith, Tony Lee, and Tony Archer, which performed until 1985.ITA Journal, volume 34, page 39 (2006)"]}, {"page": "Tony Lee (pianist)", "response": ["He had a long-lasting association of some 40 years with bassist Tony Archer in the Tony Lee Trio.
