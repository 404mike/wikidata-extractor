Then the racing began as a small group went off the front including the entire Kenyan team, a Kenyan Turkish transplant, two Ethiopians, two Eritreans, Alphonce Simbu from Tanzania and Hawkins. Of that group, Geoffrey Kirui, Tamirat Tola and Gideon Kipketer were pushing the pace as a three man pack. Kipketer faltered and it was a two man race with Simbu breaking off the front of the second pack. About 10\u00a0kilometres from the finish, Tola tried to break away. But the one breaking was Tola as Kirui came back and then set off on his own.

At 28 degrees Celsius, the race conditions were unusually hot and Hawkins suffered exhaustion and collapsed on the road. He briefly tried to continue but again collapsed, hitting his head on the road side barrier. As race rules dictate that medics need athlete permission to intervene (and thus end the athlete's participation), he was left on the roadside for several minutes in view of spectators as he did not request assistance. The games organisers received criticism for not responding sooner to the athlete's distress, though the organisers stated that they had reacted in accordance to competition regulations. Hawkins was kept overnight at Gold Coast University Hospital for review. Paul Bush, chair of Commonwealth Games Scotland, asked for a formal review of the situation and to see if changes could be made in future races to prevent such outcomes.Commonwealth Games 2018: Scotland's Callum Hawkins collapses in marathon.
