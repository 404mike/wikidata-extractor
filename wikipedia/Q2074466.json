(1884\u20131967)", "response": ["The gradual improvement under Ward seemed to free the wallet of the board and, ahead of the 1966\u201367 season, broke the club transfer record with the \u00a340,000 signing of Kevin Hector from Bradford Park Avenue, where he had hit 113 goals in just 176 games. It was the first sign of any ambition from Derby since the late 1940s and he scored on his home debut against Huddersfield Town in a 4\u20133 victory. Hector finished the season as top scorer with 16 in 30 games but, despite his success, Derby plunged to 17th in the table and it was decided not to renew the contract of Ward after five season as manager. Ward's five years at Derby were blighted by a lack of cash and a parochial attitude of the boardroom, but he is often credited with laying the foundations for the success of the 1970s, thanks to the signings of Hector and Durban, as well as providing first team football for Ron Webster, Colin Boulton and Peter Daniel, all of whom were part of the club's later title winning sides. Ward's replacements were Brian Clough and Peter Taylor who, between them, brought a revolution to the club."]}]}}
