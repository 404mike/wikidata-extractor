Brown also maintained her own more upmarket label, with outfits costing upwards of \u00a3200, but Brenda Polan said this was a bonus. \"Jeffrey Rogers's masterstroke is that he has made the connection between designer and mass market less tenuous\". In 1984, Brown's designs were exhibited at a British fashion event held at Olympia for international fashion buyers \u2013 described as a \"coming of age\" for the fashion industry \u2013 since all the ready-to-wear designers were under one roof and exhibited so that buyers and journalists could see their work.
