Brown played as an inside forward for East Fife, Blackpool, Luton Town, Portsmouth and Wigan Athletic.  He also represented Scotland, scoring six goals in 14 international appearances, and the Scottish League.  Brown was player/manager of Wigan Athletic, and also managed Luton Town, Torquay United, Bury, Nottingham Forest, Southport and Blackpool.\nAs a player, Brown won the Scottish League Cup with East Fife in 1949\u201350.

A team including Bruce Rioch, John Moore and Graham French won the Fourth Division championship in 1967\u201368 under the leadership of former player Allan Brown; two years later Malcolm Macdonald's goals helped them to another promotion, while comedian Eric Morecambe became a director of the club. Luton Town won promotion back to the First Division in 1973\u201374, but were relegated the following season by a solitary point. Former Luton player David Pleat was made manager in 1978, and by 1982\u201383 the team was back in the top flight. The team which Pleat assembled at Kenilworth Road was notable at the time for the number of black players it included; during an era when many English squads were almost entirely white, Luton often fielded a mostly black team. Talented players such as Ricky Hill, Brian Stein and Emeka Nwajiobi made key contributions to the club's success during this period, causing it to accrue \"a richer history of black stars than any in the country\", in the words of journalist Gavin Willacy."]}, {"page": "Nottingham Forest F.C.", "response": ["Johnny Quigley's solitary 1958\u201359 FA Cup semi-final goal beat Aston Villa. Billy Walker's Forest beat Luton Town 2\u20131 in the 1959 FA Cup Final. Like in 1898 Forest had lost heavily to their opponents only weeks earlier in the league. Stewart Imlach crossed for a 10th-minute opener by Roy Dwight (the cousin of Reg Dwight better known as Elton John). Tommy Wilson had Forest 2\u20130 up after 14 minutes. The game had an unusually large number of stoppages due to injury, particularly to Forest players. This was put down to the lush nature of the Wembley turf. The most notable of these stoppages was Dwight breaking his leg in a 33rd minute tackle with Brendan McNally. Forest had been on top until that point. Luton though gradually took control of the match with Dave Pacey scoring midway through the second half. Forest were reduced to nine fit men with ten minutes remaining when Bill Whare crippled with cramp became little more than a spectator. Despite late Allan Brown and Billy Bingham chances Chick Thomson conceded no further goals for Forest to beat the Wembley 1950s 'hoodoo' (where one team was hampered by losing a player through injury). Club record appearance holder Bobby McKinlay played in the final winning team captained by Jack Burkitt.", "The 1966/67 season's success seemed an opportunity to build upon with crowds of 40,000 virtually guaranteed at the time. Instead a mixture at the club of poor football management, the unique committee structure and proud amateurism meant decline after the 66/67 peak. Forest were relegated from the top flight in 1972. Matt Gillies' October 1972 managerial departure was followed by short managerial reigns by Dave Mackay and Allan Brown. A 2\u20130 Boxing Day home defeat by Notts County prompted the committee (Forest had no board of directors then) to sack Brown.", "|align=left| Allan Brown"]}, {"page": "Brian Clough", "response": ["Brian Clough replaced Allan Brown as manager of Nottingham Forest on 6 January 1975, just over 16 weeks after the end of his 44-day tenure as manager of Leeds United.
