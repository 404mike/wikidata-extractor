City faced Newcastle United, winners of the cup in 1951 and 1952. Nerves affected the City players, and they went behind to a Jackie Milburn goal after only 45\u00a0seconds.

Though Bobby Johnstone equalised in the first half, they struggled in the second, and after 57\u00a0minutes Trautmann was outwitted by Bobby Mitchell, who scored Newcastle's second goal.Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p. 168. The match finished as a 3\u20131 defeat for City, giving Trautmann a runners-up medal.", "During the previous final, nerves had contributed to the opposition scoring an early goal, but the City team was more settled on this occasion. Under the influence of Don Revie who was outstanding on the day, City scored an early goal, a left-footed strike by Joe Hayes. Birmingham equalised on 14\u00a0minutes. The match remained level until midway through the second half, when Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone scored two goals in as many minutes to give Manchester City a 3\u20131 lead. Birmingham attacked strongly in the next ten minutes. In the 75th minute, Trautmann, diving at an incoming ball, was knocked out in a collision with Birmingham's Peter Murphy in which he was hit in the neck by Murphy's right knee. No substitutes were permitted in those days, so Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, carried on. For the remaining 15\u00a0minutes he defended his net, making a crucial interception to deny Murphy once more. Manchester City held on for the victory, and Trautmann was the hero because of his spectacular saves in the last minutes of the match. Trautmann admitted later that he had spent the last part of the match \"in a kind of fog\"."]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["McDowall fined Revie \u00a327 for missing two weeks of training for a family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had already won permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie for much of the 1955\u201356 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist for Joe Hayes's opening goal, and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager's instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3\u20131 victory; Revie was named as Man of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not forgotten, and he was moved to right-half in the 1956\u201357 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road."]}, {"page": "British Home Championship", "response": ["|  Nat Lofthouse   Bobby Johnstone   Stan Pearson   Ivor Allchurch", "|  Dennis Wilshaw   Bobby Johnstone (2)", "|align=\"left\"| Bobby Johnstone"]}, {"page": "Coronation Cup (football)", "response": ["|IR ||||Bobby Johnstone"]}]}}
