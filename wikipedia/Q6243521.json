He was born in the district of Basford, Nottingham. Nothing is known of his early life. He studied art at the Slade School in London. Also unknown is when and why he came to live in this particular area but he seems to have spent most of his life in Stansted, Essex.In nearby Bishop's Stortford, he portrayed many ordinary people and local characters in their working environment. One of his earliest 'local' works was 'The Landlord of the Chequers'. \"This was to be the first of nine paintings he had shown at the Royal Academy between 1931 and 1945, perhaps the most 'famous' of which was 'The Week's Ration', painted in the early years of the war and featuring another local man, Charles J. Woodford, standing at the counter of his butchers shop in Dane Street.\"Because he had exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy former historians mistakenly added the initials 'RA' (Royal Academician) to his name. In fact he never attained this title, but was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters. He also exhibited his work in Paris and New York.It seems he has continued living in Stansted, but his artistic ability was ended early by arthritis.", "link_mentions": {}}}
