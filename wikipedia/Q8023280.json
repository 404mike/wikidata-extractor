During this period, there was no Hong Kong Governor and Wilsone Black acted as administrator. James Stewart Lockhart, the Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong, was sent back from England to make a survey of New Territories before formal transfer. The survey found that the new frontier at Sham Chun River (Shenzhen river) suggested by Wilsone Black was far from ideal. It excluded the town of Shenzhen (Sham Chun), and the boundary would divide the town. There was no mountain range as a natural border. Lockhart suggested moving the frontier to the line of hills north of Shenzhen. This suggestion was not received favourably and the Chinese official suggested the frontier be moved to the hill much further south of the Sham Chun River. It was settled in March 1899 that the boundary remain at the Sham Chun River."]}, {"page": "Governor of Hong Kong", "response": ["| Sir Wilsone Black\u5e03\u529b"]}, {"page": "List of mountains, peaks and hills in Hong Kong", "response": ["| Black Hill || 304 || || || located between Yau Tong and Tiu Keng Leng facing Junk Bay; named for former administrator Major General Wilsone Black, British Army officer"]}, {"page": "W.
