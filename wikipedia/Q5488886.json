In the west this was pioneered in the early 1960s by Prof. Frank Pantridge in Belfast.  Today portable defibrillators are among the many very important tools carried by ambulances.

His sensitivity to the problem came from two sources.

Second, Pantridge had recently read a telling study in a medical journal that indicated that among middle-aged or younger men with acute myocardial infarction (MI), more than 60% died within 1\u00a0hour of the onset of symptoms. Thus the problem of death from acute MI had to be solved outside the hospital, not in the emergency room or the coronary care unit. \"The majority of deaths from coronary attacks were occurring\", he wrote, \"outside the hospital, and nothing whatever was being done about them. It became very clear to me that a coronary care unit confined to the hospital would have a minimal impact on mortality.\" He wanted his coronary-care unit in the community."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Irish inventions and discoveries", "response": ["*1965: Portable defibrillator created by Frank Pantridge."]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (F)", "response": ["# Frank Pantridge"]}, {"page": "John Anderson (inventor)", "response": ["Professor Frank Pantridge was responsible for development of the world's first portable defibrillator designed for use outside of hospital, which was subsequently manufactured and sold throughout the world.

Meanwhile, general practitioners (primary care doctors) with strong leadership from Kenneth Easton, were founding GP-based-schemes which, in due course, led to the foundation of the British Association for Immediate Care Schemes (BASICS). Baskett was a founder member of this organisation and was later Chairman. He was also a founder member of the Community Resuscitation Advisory Committee (CRAC). The constitution of this committee was amended in May 1984 giving rise to the Resuscitation Council (UK) - the first Resuscitation Council in Europe. Five years later, Peter was one of the Founding Members of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and, in August 1989, at the first Executive Committee meeting of the ERC, he was elected chairman."]}]}}
