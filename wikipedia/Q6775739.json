He is a professor at Cardiff University.\nHuxley proved a result on gaps between prime numbers, namely that if pn denotes the n-th prime number and if \u03b8  > 7/12, then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            n\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          p\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        <\n        \n          p\n          \n            n\n          \n          \n            \u03b8\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{n+1}-p_{n}<p_{n}^{\\theta },}\n  for all sufficiently large n.\nHuxley also improved the known bound on the Dirichlet divisor problem.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people by Erd\u0151s number", "response": ["* Martin Huxley"]}, {"page": "Gauss circle problem", "response": ["with the lower bound from Hardy and Landau in 1915, and the upper bound proved by Martin Huxley in 2000."]}, {"page": "Huxley (surname)", "response": ["*Martin Huxley (born 1944), British mathematician"]}, {"page": "List of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers", "response": ["*Martin Huxley"]}, {"page": "Huxley, Martin", "response": ["#redirectMartin Huxley"]}]}}
