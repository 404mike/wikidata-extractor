When he found out, John Freeman took issue with the plan, arguing that while the strips had merit for the intended younger audience IHP was aimed at, they were inappropriate for DWM, which was trying to tailor more for Doctor Who fans, instead of the mainstream audience previous editors had aimed for'. Freeman's argument was eventually accepted by Marvel UK as sales figures of DWM improved under his leadership; albeit with two exceptions. The two part strip \"Hunger at the Ends of Time!\" from issues 2 and 3 of IHP was reprinted in DWM issues 157 and 158 (February \u2013 March, 1990); and the one unpublished strip completed for IHP issue 13 before the publication was cancelled, \"Doctor Conkerer!\", which appeared in DWM issue 162 (July 1990).", "Fourth Doctor Who crossover: The Incomplete Death's Head \u2013 Death's Head II was an immediate success, which meant Neary was ordered to create more titles. The simplest way to do this quickly was to reprint the original Death's Head comic series. The job was given to editor John Freeman. 'Paul was ordered to come up with more Death's Head titles,' said Freeman 'and the easiest way to do that was to reprint the original series. That didn't mean he liked it... I suggested the \"wraparound story\" featuring DHII to help convince him'. The series \u2013 which ran for twelve issues \u2013 was called The Incomplete Death's Head (January \u2013 December 1993). However, it did not only repeat the original series, but also included a number of other Death's Head strips from Marvel publications, pretty much in order of release, the exception being The Transformers stories and The Body in Question series. Accordingly, the twelve issues of The Incomplete Death's Head included everything else from \"High Noon Tex\" through to the Marvel Comics Presents story \"The Deadliest Game\", as well as beginning (issue 1) and ending (issue 12) with the two Doctor Who Magazine strips \"The Crossroads of Time\" and \"Party Animals\" \u2013 now colourised from their original black and white. Strangely, the publication also incorporated a non-Death's Head story early-run (issues 4 and 5), the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip \"Keepsake\" (DWM 140; September 1988) once again starring the Seventh Doctor, and once again colourised. This was possible due to way the whole series was framed with the wraparounds, with Death's Head II witnessing these past events in an effort to learn more about his original incarnation. In this way, the Doctor's status of arch-nemesis of the original Death's Head is heightened even before \"Time Bomb\" appears in issue 9 \u2013 the only original Death's Head series strip featuring the Doctor.
