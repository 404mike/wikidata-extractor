He has written widely on German literature, intellectual history and religion and is known particularly for his award-winning extensive biography of Goethe (of which two of a projected three volumes have been published). Boyle became a fellow of the British Academy in 2000.Boyle's biography of Goethe currently runs to two volumes and he is writing the third. George Steiner has called him a 'critic of vivacious perspicacity' and compares the scope of his work to \"Lord Bullock's double portraits of Hitler and Stalin, Richard Holmes's Coleridge, David Cairns's Berlioz, Michael Holroyd's Shaw, Richardson's Picasso\", whilst The New York Times Book Review describes his biography as a 'remarkable achievement', adding that 'there is nothing comparable to this study in any language'. The biography has been translated into German by Holger Fliessbach. The Goethe Institut awarded Boyle their Goethe Medal in 2000. The second volume was shortlisted for the British Academy Book Prize in 2001.He lives in Cambridge with his wife and four children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Magdalene College, Cambridge", "response": ["* Nicholas Boyle, Schroeder Professor of German and biographer of Goethe"]}, {"page": "Boyle", "response": ["*Nicholas Boyle (born 1946), British literature historian"]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 178 || German Literature || Nicholas Boyle ||  || || literature"]}, {"page": "Schr\u00f6der Professor of German", "response": ["* Nicholas Boyle (2006)"]}, {"page": "Italian Journey", "response": ["Goethe stayed almost three months in Rome, which he described as \"the First City of the World\".I.J., p. 116.

Goethe is gazing out through the autumnal landscape southeast of Rome, with his eyes arguably resting at infinity, though the painter, Johann Tischbein, wrote that Goethe is depicted pondering the fate of man's works.Rudolf M.Bisanz, 'The Birth of a Myth: Tischbein's Goethe in the Roman Campagna,' Monatshefte , Summer, 1988, Vol. 80, No. 2 (Summer, 1988), pp. 187\u2013199 Tischbein, whom Goethe met in Italy, portrays the writer as an idealized person. Goethe wears a large wide-brimmed grey hat, fashionable among German artists in Rome at the time, and a creamy white traveler's duster. He is portrayed in a classical manner, informally recumbent in the open air, surrounded by Roman ruins, with the Campagna di Roma in the background. Goethe himself is reclining on blocks of granite, \u2013 in the first draft figures with hieroglyphs suggesting they were pieces of a fallen obelisk \u2013 emblematic Egypt, a civilization predating those of classical antiquity \u2013 Greece is nodded to by the inclusion of a fragment of a frieze depicting Iphigenia in Tauris, the subject of one of Goethe's plays. He recited extracts of his play, which he had begun turning into verse a year earlier, to Tischbein. Tischbein was much taken by the play and depicted the scene of Iphigenia meeting her brother in the painting, on the relief behind Goethe to his left.
