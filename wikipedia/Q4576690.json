Born in Kelloe, Seymour is one of the club's all-time greats, and was known as 'Mr. Newcastle United' after the various years and roles he delivered for the club. As a player, despite his small physique, he was famous for his runs from the left wing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["The team returned to the FA Cup final in 1924, in the second final held at the then new Wembley Stadium. They defeated Aston Villa, winning the club's second FA Cup. Three years later, they won the First Division championship a fourth time in 1926\u201327, with Hughie Gallacher, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the club's history, captaining the team. Other key players in this period were Neil Harris, Stan Seymour and Frank Hudspeth. In 1930, Newcastle United came close to relegation, and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for Chelsea, and at the same time Andy Cunningham became the club's first team manager. In 1931\u201332, the club won the FA Cup a third time.

Milburn, now 19, had been told by his father not to sign anything until he had first shown it to him and so he refused, instead promising to return in due course with a signed professional contract once his father had approved it. Seymour, apparently concerned that news of Miburn's trial performance might alert other clubs, decided not to wait and on the Sunday following the trial he arrived, unannounced, on the Milburns' doorstep in Ashington. Seymour patiently put his case to Milburn's father, Alec, explaining that he would be taken on part-time because of his continuing pit work, on thirty shillings a week, plus two shillings and sixpence a game \"for his tea\", and the same amount again for his bus fare to and from the ground. At this point, as Milburn Sr. was considering the terms, Seymour reportedly began rubbing two five pound notes together behind his back. The rustling caught Alec's attention and persuaded him to allow Jackie to sign. Seymour, elated, invited everyone to the West End Club for a celebratory drink, later exclaiming that \"I had secured my finest ever signing for ten quid and a couple of rounds of Newcastle Brown Ale\". Milburn's official registration as a Newcastle United player came on 23 August 1938.", "United manager Stan Seymour almost entirely rebuilt his Second Division squad during the warHutchinson, 2004: 133 so when United played Barnsley at St James' Park in the third round of the resumed FA Cup on 5 January 1946, Milburn, Bobby Cowell, Charlie Crowe, Joe Harvey and Charlie Wayman were five of nine players making their competitive debut. 60,284 spectators saw Milburn score twice \u2013 his first official goals for the club \u2013 in a 4\u20132 win.

Two weeks later, Milburn put a transfer request to the Newcastle board, stating that: \"I need to get away from Tyneside as my wife's health is suffering\".Kirkup, 1990: 32 The request \"sent Tyneside into a panic\"Hutchinson, 2004: 165 but was soon withdrawn after an intervention by Stan Seymour. Milburn later explained that he had been swayed by his international colleagues to believe that \"big money could be made...outside of soccer if I moved to another club...on reflection, I realised what a foolish young chap I'd been\".Kirkup, 1990: 33 Meanwhile, United were \"enjoying themselves back at the top\";Hutchins, 2004: 163 on Christmas Eve 1948, Newcastle led the Division One table by a point.
