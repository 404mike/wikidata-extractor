Like his father before him, Vidal was Secretary to several flag officers.  The post demanded abilities unusual in a seaman.  The Naval and Military Gazette explained why:   Vidal was Secretary to Sir Graham Moore ( Baltic, 1813); Sir Edward Owen (Canada, 1815); Sir Robert Lambert (Cape and St Helena, 1820-1); Sir Edward Owen (West Indies, 1823); Sir Robert Otway (South America, 1826\u201329); and Sir Graham Hamond (South America, 1834\u201336).  In those stations, therefore, it was Vidal's job to become the \"oracle\" who could be consulted on local affairs and politics.  Being a linguist, he had to interpret for admirals and senior officers on their shore visits."]}]}}
