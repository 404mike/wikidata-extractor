Entering the All-Ireland SFC qualifiers again, the county advanced to the 2008 All-Ireland SFC final against a Kerry team then bidding to win three consecutive titles. Kerry did not. Despite Peter Canavan's retirement, Mulligan's disciplinary problems and O'Neill's on-off retirement through injury, Tyrone won a third All-Ireland SFC title. Harte deployed Justin McMahon to effectively deal with Kerry's Kieran Donaghy (a forward who had become more prominent since the 2005 final), while the half-back line of David Harte, Conor Gormley and Philip Jordan outperformed expectations and Cavanagh scored five points from play. Eamonn Sweeney reckoned 2008 to be \"the supreme managerial achievement of Harte's career\"."]}, {"page": "GPA Gaelic Team of the Year", "response": ["|David Harte"]}, {"page": "History of the Tyrone county football team", "response": ["The 2008 campaign was again plagued by injuries. Things then got worse as they relinquished their Ulster title to Down after a replay in which Down won by a point after 160 minutes. After two wins in the Football Qualifiers against Louth at Drogheda and Westmeath at Healy Park in Omagh, they faced Mayo in Round 3 in Croke Park for a place in the quarter finals. Tyrone defeated Mayo 0\u201313 to 1\u20139, earning Tyrone a place in the quarter finals (last 8) of the championship, where they faced Leinster champions Dublin in a repeat of the 2005 final clash. Tyrone made the brighter start to this game, and goals from Sean Cavanagh and Joe McMahon put Tyrone 2\u20135 to 1\u20133 up at the break. A third goal by David Harte in the second half ended the game as a contest, Tyrone winning 3\u201314 to 1\u20138. Tyrone then faced Wexford for a place in the senior football final but earlier in the day it was the Tyrone minors who booked their place in the final with a complete football performance, and eased past Meath on a scoreline of 1\u201321 to 2\u20137. They faced Mayo in the final. The seniors then always looked comfortable in their meeting with Wexford, and after racking up an 8-point lead at half-time they went through on a score of 0\u201323 to 1\u201314, to set up a 21 September date with All Ireland champions Kerry. In a thrilling All-Ireland Final Tyrone defeated Kerry 1\u201315 to 0\u201314 to win the Sam Maguire Cup for the third time. A week later the Tyrone Minor team defeated Mayo 1\u201320 to 1\u201315 in a replay to win the Thomas Markham Cup. Thus Tyrone became the first county since Kerry in 1980 to win All-Ireland Senior and Minor titles in the same year, and the first Ulster county ever to gain this achievement."]}, {"page": "Harte", "response": ["* David Harte (Gaelic footballer) (born 1981), Tyrone Gaelic footballer"]}, {"page": "Errigal Ciar\u00e1n GAC", "response": ["* David Harte"]}]}}
