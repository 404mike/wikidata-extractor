In 1874, the British scholar Isaac Taylor brought up the idea of a genetic relationship between Etruscan and Hungarian, of which also Jules Martha would approve in his exhaustive study La langue \u00e9trusque (1913). In 1911, the French orientalist Baron Carra de Vaux suggested a connection between Etruscan and the Altaic languages. The Hungarian connection was revived by Mario Alinei, Emeritus Professor of Italian Languages at the University of Utrecht.Alinei, Mario (2003). Etrusco: una forma arcaica di ungherese. Il Mulino: Bologna. Alinei's proposal has been rejected by Etruscan experts such as Giulio M. Facchetti,Facchetti, Giulio M. \"The Interpretation of Etruscan Texts and its Limits\" (PDF). In: Journal of Indo-European Studies 33, 3/4, 2005, 359\u2013388. Quote from p.\u00a0371: \u2018[...] suffice it to say that Alinei clears away all the combinatory work done on Etruscan (for grammar specially) to try to make Uralic inflections fit without ripping the seams. He completely ignores the aforesaid recent findings in phonology (and phoneme/grapheme relationships), returning to the obsolete but convenient theory that the handwriting changed and orthography was not consolidated'. Finno-Ugric experts such as Angela Marcantonio,Marcantonio, Angela (2004). \"Un caso di 'fantalinguistica'. A proposito di Mario Alinei: 'Etrusco: una forma arcaica di ungherese'.\" In: Studi e Saggi Linguistici XLII, 173\u2013200, where Marcantonio states that \"La tesi dell\u2019Alinei \u00e8 da rigettare senza alcuna riserva\" (\"Alinei's thesis must be rejected without any reservation\"), criticizes his methodology and the fact that he ignored the comparison with Latin and Greek words in pnomastic and institutional vocabulary.
