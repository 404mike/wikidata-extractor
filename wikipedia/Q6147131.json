Introduced in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers as the series' new protagonist after Jamie Lee Curtis refused to return as Laurie Strode, the character also appears in Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Jamie was created by Alan B. McElroy and portrayed by child actress Danielle Harris in the fourth and fifth films of the series, while J.C. Brandy played her in the sixth (although Harris reappears in an archival opening flashback sequence in the latter film\u2019s Producer\u2019s Cut). Originally, the character was named Brittany \"Britti\" Lloyd, before her name was changed to Jamie, in an homage to Jamie Lee Curtis.", "Jamie Lloyd's first literary appearance was in October 1988, in Nicholas Grabowsky's novelization of Halloween 4. The official Halloween: 30 Years of Terror comic book, taking place in the new continuity, has an adult Tommy Doyle illustrating comic books. Various elements from the fourth through sixth movies can be seen on his books, one of which is Jamie. The cancelled comic Halloween: The Mark of Thorn was to feature Jamie, as well as Tommy Doyle, Rachel Carruthers and the Man in Black.", "The ending of Halloween 4 features Jamie stabbing her foster mother as she seemingly inherits the evil of her uncle. Little and McElroy did not return for the sequel. Little later said the duo would have furthered developed the relationship between Jamie and Rachel: \"What we would have done was to work on the relationship between the sisters \u2013 between Danielle and Ellie \u2013 as I do think that was the core of the movie then. We clearly would\u2019ve gone in a very different way, but it really wasn\u2019t up to me to decide at that point because I didn\u2019t have time to participate.\" The first draft of the screenplay for Halloween 5 was written by Shem Bitterman. Bitterman's screenplay was written to have Jamie Lloyd becoming evil after stabbing her foster mother in Halloween 4. This idea was rejected by the studio and Akkad, who brought in Michael Jacobs to re-write the script. After reviewing the screenplay, director Othenin-Girard added Jamie's inability to speak to the draft, along with the supernatural plot device of her telepathic visions connected to Michael. Othenin-Girard planned for Jamie to be stabbed in the leg by Michael while she was in a laundry shoot so that her escape would seem \"almost impossible\" to audiences. He believed that a young girl being stabbed \"in the extreme confinement of a very dark chute is sooo mean and sooo unfair. I took great care not to shoot it in a gory way, there was no blood splurging out of the leg, just the knife entering the flesh. Just a very short hit which was supposed to hurt and scandalize an audience.\" In the original closing scene of Halloween 5, after Jamie finds that Michael has escaped from the police station, she is approached by a black-cloaked figure, who is in fact Dr. Terrence Wynn, the head of Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where Michael had been remanded as a child.", "Although the producers at the time had already sought to make a sixth Halloween film, a series of complicated legal battles ensued which delayed plans for a sequel; eventually Miramax Films (via its Dimension Films division) bought the rights to the Halloween series. Phil Rosenberg was the first writer hired for the film. His script, titled Halloween 666: The Origin, was hated by Akkad, who tossed the script across his room after he finished reading it. The script mentions Jamie as having disappeared and she has a brief appearance \"in the form of a series of rapid shots during the Samhain/virtual reality segment: Surrounded by scattering rats, Jamie screams as she is trapped in a cage made of human bones.\" In June 1994, Farrands was hired to write a new screenplay, as the film had an impending shooting date scheduled for October in Salt Lake City, Utah. Farrands has said his initial intent for the film was to \"bridge the later films (4\u20135) in the series to the earlier films (1\u20132) while at the same time taking the story into new territory so that the series could expand for future installments.\" Farrands expanded the \"Curse of Thorn\" plot line, in which Jamie Lloyd is kidnapped by a covert cult who has cursed Michael Myers via the Runic symbol of Thorn, which compels him to kill and also affords him immortality.", "While the character of Jamie Lloyd dies early in the film, the initial versions of Farrands' script had her character surviving until the final act, at which point she was ultimately killed by Michael.", "When screenwriter Kevin Williamson first outlined Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), he created the storyline in which Laurie Strode has faked her own death and taken on a new identity as a specific way of retconning the character's death in Halloween 4. In Williamson's original treatment, there are scenes in which a Hillcrest student does a report on Michael Myers' killing spree, mentioning the death of Jamie, complete with flashbacks to 4-6 mentioned in the text. \"Keri\"/Laurie responds to hearing the student's report on the death of her daughter by going into a restroom and throwing up.Williamson, Kevin. \"Halloween 7 treatment \" In a controversial decision, director Steve Miner retconned the series with Halloween H20: 20 Years Later. This installment retained Laurie's faked death from Williamson's treatment, revealing that she did so in order to avoid detection by her relentless brother. Under a new identity, Laurie has fled to Summer Glen, California, along with her only son, John Tate (Josh Hartnett). However, to focus more on the Laurie Strode character, the events of parts 4, 5, and 6 are implicitly written out of the continuity, thus erasing the Jamie Lloyd character from the new canon.", "After the release of Halloween: Resurrection, there were various ideas on how to proceed with a ninth installment. Josh Stolberg, who also unsuccessfully proposed a Hellraiser crossover with Bobby Florsheim, pitched Halloween: Bad Blood, which would have brought back Jamie Lloyd. The film would have been set between Halloween H20 and Halloween: Resurrection and depict Jamie as having survived multiple encounters with Michael in addition to having \"honed her self defense capabilities.\" After a fight between Michael and Jamie, the two would be transported to a hospital where Jamie's blood would be taken and accidentally placed in the storage freezer with no name. This would set up seven random people receiving Jamie's blood via a transfusion and thereby becoming targets of Michael. Stolberg saw this plot point as a way to offer more variety to the series: \"we leaned into the idea of the bloodline quite literally. It was our way of being able to expand out the franchise and make it so that we weren\u2019t having to go after the same person every single time with each movie.\u201d Development on a direct sequel suddenly halted when Moustapha Akkad was killed in the 2005 Amman hotel bombings while attending a wedding in Jordan, and his son Malek decided to take the series in a different direction.", "In 2021, Halloween Kills producer Ryan Freimann expressed his fondness for the character and desire to implement her in the current film trilogy: \"I would love to find some way to bring back that character, the Jamie Lloyd character, in some way. It just didn't fit within the framework of the storyline.\"", "Melissa Joan Hart had auditioned for the role, among various other girls. Up against her was Danielle Harris, who had previously starred in One Life to Live as Samantha Garretson; Harris was ultimately cast in the role after auditioning in New York. Jamie Lloyd was Danielle Harris' first feature film role, for which she appears at horror conventions and on Halloween series-related websites. Little recalled Harris coming to the session with her mother and that they \"knew the minute she walked into the room\" that they wanted her as Jamie, citing her intelligence. Little said that Harris \"really just got it from the beginning\" and was without tantrums, whining, or crying. Little did not remember the other auditions for the part of Jamie: \"To me, in my memory, Jamie Lloyd was always Danielle.\" Harris recalled filming Halloween 4 and Halloween 5 as a child with fondness: \"I got to run around yelling and screaming in a Halloween costume, even thought it was really April. Basically all the stuff you really look forward to as a kid. You really don\u2019t think about the fact that you\u2019re working, because you\u2019re young and having so much fun.\" Besides Harris, the other child actor to have a major role in Halloween 5 was Jeffrey Landman, who portrayed Billy. Landman watched Halloween 4 with Harris and her mother to become familiar with the series. Before filming started, Harris and Landman were brought to Salt Lake City to be trained by a speech pathologist who worked with the pair \"on the sign language as well as discussing with us the pathology of stuttering, why people stutter, as well as under what circumstances the stutter would become more prominent.\""]}, {"page": "Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play", "response": ["| Jamie Lloyd"]}, {"page": "The Homecoming", "response": ["Trafalgar Revival  2015, performed at the Trafalgar Studios, London, starring John Macmillan, Keith Allen, John Simm, Gemma Chan, Ron Cook and Gary Kemp.
