Papaloizou is a professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at the University of Cambridge. He works on the theory of accretion disks, with particular application to the formation of planets. He received his D.Phil. in 1972 from the University of Sussex under the supervision of Roger J. Tayler. The title of his thesis is The Vibrational Instability in Massive Stars.\nHe discovered the Papaloizou-Pringle instability together with Jim Pringle in 1984. Papaloizou also made major contributions in various areas such as the radial-orbit instability, toroidal modes in stars and different instabilities in accretion disks.\nThe asteroid 17063 Papaloizou is named after John Papaloizou.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Meanings of minor planet names: 17001\u201318000", "response": ["| 17063 Papaloizou ||  || John Papaloizou (born 1947), British astrophysicist || "]}, {"page": "Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge", "response": ["*John Papaloizou"]}, {"page": "John C.
