The father died 21 December 1831. Henry was the eldest of a family of seven children. He was educated first at Holdstock's Academy, and afterwards at the Bath Grammar School. At a very early age he showed his aptitude for music. He was taught by his father, and afterwards by James Morris Coombs, the organist of Chippenham. In 1807, being then just ten years of age, he performed for the first time in public, in a duet with his father. On 15 June 1830 he played with Johann Hummel, in the latter's Grand Sonata, op. 92. He was a virtuoso performer, and known throughout his career as a musical instructor. He was popular in his native city, and generally known as 'Field of Bath'.\nField was an acquaintance of Charles-Valentin Alkan, and played the premiere of the latter's 'Second Concerto da camera', which was dedicated to him, at Bath in 1834 during Alkan's first visit to England.\nHe was a good scholar in French, Italian, Spanish, and German. While working as teacher of music at Prior Park College, Field in 1835 was converted to Catholicism by the Rev. Dr. Gentili. He was formally received into that church by Bishop Baines during the winter of that year. He gave his last concert on 13 May 1848, in the Bath Assembly Rooms. Whilst playing Wallace's Cracovienne he was suddenly struck down by a paralytic seizure. He died on 19 May 1848, aged 50, at the house of his brother Frederick, the surgeon, in Northumberland Buildings, Bath.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles-Valentin Alkan", "response": ["In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009.Conway (2010), 2\u20133. The correspondence is in the Spanish Historical Archives\u00a0\u2013 see 'Sources', below. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will,Luguenot (1997), 26. or became lost after his death.Smith (2000) I, 83\u20135 Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field;Smith (2000) I, 22. it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to MasarnauLetter to Masarnau of 18/19 August 1835. Sanjurjo collection, Spanish Historical Archives. and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo piano, the Twelve Caprices, published in 1837 as Opp. 12, 13, 15 and 16.Conway (2013b), 4\u20135. Op.\u00a016, the Trois scherzi de bravoure, is dedicated to Masarnau. In January 1836, Liszt recommended Alkan for the post of Professor at the Geneva Conservatoire, which Alkan declined,Fran\u00e7ois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 106. and in 1837 he wrote an enthusiastic review of Alkan's Op.\u00a015 Caprices in the Revue et gazette musicale.Revue et gazette musicale, October 1837, 460\u2013461 (in French).

Three Scherzini by Masarnau were published in London in 1828, at a time when Gomis was also publishing Spanish-style keyboard pieces there. Masarnau also became a friend of the English pianist and teacher Henry Ibbot Field (1797\u20131848), and around 1834 became a close friend of Charles-Valentin Alkan (as evidenced by an exchange of letters extending over forty years).Now in the Spanish Historical Archives Alkan dedicated to Masarnau his Trois \u00e9tudes de bravoure op. 16 of 1837.  While in Paris, Masarnau became, at Rossini\u2019s recommendation, the music teacher of the daughters of the Infante Prince Francisco de Paula."]}]}}
