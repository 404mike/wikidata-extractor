He is best known for chairing a major review of UK insolvency law (whose report issued in 1982 is widely referred to as the Cork Report and led to the passing of the Insolvency Act 1986).\nHe was a partner in Cork Gully, a well-known firm of insolvency practitioners (established in 1935 with his father, WH Cork, and Harry Gully) which in 1980 became part of Coopers & Lybrand. Cork was recognised as an \"insolvency baron\" who had a dominant role in that field which set him apart from mainstream accountancy.Prior to his election of Mayor he had served as a sheriff of London for 1975\u201376.\nHe also contributed to governance of the arts, as Vice Chairman of the Arts Council and Chairman of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and guiding other bodies including the Philharmonia Orchestra and London Festival Ballet.", "link_mentions": {}}}
