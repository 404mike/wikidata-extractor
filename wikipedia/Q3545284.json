He is best known for chairing a major review of UK insolvency law (whose report issued in 1982 is widely referred to as the Cork Report and led to the passing of the Insolvency Act 1986).\nHe was a partner in Cork Gully, a well-known firm of insolvency practitioners (established in 1935 with his father, WH Cork, and Harry Gully) which in 1980 became part of Coopers & Lybrand. Cork was recognised as an \"insolvency baron\" who had a dominant role in that field which set him apart from mainstream accountancy.Prior to his election of Mayor he had served as a sheriff of London for 1975\u201376.\nHe also contributed to governance of the arts, as Vice Chairman of the Arts Council and Chairman of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and guiding other bodies including the Philharmonia Orchestra and London Festival Ballet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Berkhamsted School", "response": ["*Sir Kenneth Cork (1913\u20131991), accountant, and Lord Mayor of the City of London, 1978\u20131979"]}, {"page": "List of lord mayors of London", "response": ["|1978|| Sir Kenneth Cork, GBE || Horners ||", "|1996|| Sir Roger Cork ||Bowyer || Son of Sir Kenneth Cork (1978) "]}, {"page": "Alleyn Court Prep School", "response": ["* Sir Kenneth Cork, Lord Mayor of London, 1978\u20131979"]}, {"page": "Marc Sinden", "response": ["He is an atheist and secularist, a Fellow of the Zoological Society, a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Innholders and was awarded the Freedom of the City of London by the Lord Mayor Sir Kenneth Cork.

The first concerned setting a fair system of priority among claims of different creditors. This primarily centred upon the ability of powerful contractual creditors, particularly banks, to agree to take a security interest over a company's property, leaving unsecured creditors without any remaining assets to satisfy their claims. Immediately after Salomon's case and the controversy created over the use of floating charges, the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 mandated that preferential creditors (employees, liquidator expenses and taxes at the time) also had priority over the holder of a floating charge (now IA 1986 section 175). In the Enterprise Act 2002 a further major change was to create a ring-fenced fund for all unsecured creditors out of around 20 per cent of the assets subject to a floating charge.See IA 1986 s 176A and Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) Order 2003 (SI 2003/2097) At the same time, the priority for taxpayers' claims was abolished. Since then, debate for further reform has shifted to whether the floating charge should be abolished altogether and whether a ring-fenced fund should be taken from fixed security interests.See R Goode, \u2018The Case for the Abolition of the Floating Charge\u2019 in J Getzler and J Payne, Company Charges: Spectrum and Beyond (OUP 2006) and LA Bebchuk and JM Fried, \u2018The Uneasy Case for the Priority of Secured Claims in Bankruptcy\u2019 (1996) 105 Yale Law Journal 857\u2013934. A proposal for a ring fenced fund of fixed security was made in Germany by the Kommission F\u00fcr Insolvenzrecht, Erster Bericht der Kommission f\u00fcr Insolvenzrecht (1985) The second major area for reform was to facilitate the rescue of businesses that could still be viable. Following the Cork Report in 1982,Kenneth Cork, Report of the Review Committee on Insolvency Law and Practice (1982) Cmnd 8558 the Insolvency Act 1986 created the administration procedure, requiring (on paper) that the managers of insolvent businesses would attempt to rescue the company, and would act in all creditors' interests. After the Enterprise Act 2002 this almost wholly replaced the receivership rules by which secured creditors, with a floating charge over all assets, could run an insolvent company without regard to the claims of unsecured creditors. The third area of reform concerned accountability for people who worsened or benefited from insolvencies. As recommended by the Cork Report, the Company Directors' Disqualification Act 1986 meant directors who breached company law duties or committed fraud could be prevented from working as directors for up to 15 years. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 214 created liability for wrongful trading. If directors failed to start the insolvency procedures when they ought to have known insolvency was inevitable, they would have to pay for the additional debts run up through prolonged trading. Furthermore, the provisions on fraudulent conveyances were extended, so that any transaction at an undervalue or other preference (without any bad intent) could be avoided, and unwound by an insolvent company.", "In the UK, the theories underpinning actual insolvency law policy generally stem from the Report of the Review Committee on Insolvency Law and Practice(1982) Cmnd 8558 produced by committee chaired by Kenneth Cork in 1982. The central argument of the report was that too many companies were simply left to fail when they could be revived, saved or brought to a close in a more orderly way. Cork advocated that the law should encourage a \"rescue culture\", to restore companies back to profitability, which would be in the longer term interests of creditors. Moreover, the Report suggested that insolvency law should \"recognise that the effects of insolvency are not limited to the private interests of the insolvent and his creditors, but that other interests of society or other groups in society are vitally affected by the insolvency and its outcome.\"(1982) Cmnd 8558, para 192 This largely reflected the previous common law position, which rejected debt collection as being the sole aim, and viewed insolvency to be a matter of public interest.In re Paget [1927] 2 Ch 85, 87\u201388, per Lord Hanworth MR The Cork Report was followed by a White Paper in 1984, A Revised Framework for Insolvency LawCmnd 9175 (1984) which led to the Insolvency Act 1986."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*1978: Peter Le Cheminant, Kenneth Cork, Ronald Davison"]}, {"page": "Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986", "response": ["The CDDA consolidated the law relating to disqualification orders and introduced the concept of mandatory disqualification, following up on Sir Kenneth Cork's recommendations in the Insolvency Law and Practice, Report of the Review Committee (1982) (Cmnd 8558).
