He was one of the founding members of BFCS. With studios in London, New York, Los Angeles and Milan, BFCS was one of the most successful commercial production companies of all time, winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Advertising Festival an unprecedented six times. Fulford directed the popular Go to work on an egg television commercials for the Egg Marketing Board during the 1960s. Fulford also directed many of the iconic Guinness television commercials of the 1970s and 1980s, along with other memorable spots like the Courage Best 'Rabbit Rabbit' commercial featuring the specially written song by Chas and Dave, and the iconic Simple skincare commercial in which robotic arms spray a pristine white lily with colouring and perfume.\nHis work earned him numerous awards and much recognition. The famous \"Go to work on an egg\" television ad campaign which he directed earned him the nickname \"the eggman\" within the industry. John Lennon makes reference to Len as \"the eggman\" in The Beatles song \"I Am the Walrus\".\nLen Fulford retired in 1995 and resided in East Anglia.

Both adverts used two lines of the song, with changed lyrics sung by a sound-alike Steve Harley. Initially, the advert's producers approached Harley with the idea of re-writing and re-recording the lines himself. Harley was uncomfortable at the idea of doing this, but gave permission for the producers to adapt the song themselves. The lyrics were re-written by Malcolm Green and an unknown vocalist was used to replicate Harley's vocal style. Both adverts were directed by Len Fulford and produced by BFCS. The use of the song in the adverts led EMI to re-release the song as 7-inch single in the UK in March 1988, but it did not chart."]}, {"page": "Leonard Alfred Fulford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Len Fulford"]}, {"page": "Leonard Fulford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Len Fulford"]}]}}
