He was educated at Harrow School and at Balliol College, Oxford, and served in the 1st Life Guards from 1839 until 1843. In 1826 he inherited Holmewood Hall in Huntingdonshire from his father. He also inherited the Redleaf estate in Kent from his great-uncle William.He was a J.P. and a Deputy Lieutenant for Kent and Huntingdonshire.At the 1852 general election Wells was elected as a member of parliament (MP) for the borough of Beverley.\nHe held the seat until his defeat in the 1857 by the Liberal Edward Glover.\nAn election petition was lodged by Wells on the grounds that Glover was not duly qualified,\nbecause he did not meet the property-holding requirements.\nThe issue had been raised during the election, and handbills circulated to that effect, but Glover had denied the allegations. On 3 August 1853, the committee ruled that Glover had not been duly qualified, and that his election was void.\nA by-election was held on 11 August 1853, when Wells stood again, but was defeated by the Conservative candidate Henry Edwards.\nWells contested the City of Peterborough at the 1852 general election, where he was the third-placed of the three Liberal candidates. He won the seat at the 1868 general election,\ndefeating the Liberal MP Thomson Hankey, a former Governor of the Bank of England.
