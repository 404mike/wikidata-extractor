His wealth came from the textile business, but on both sides of his family there were connections with the arts and traditions of patronage going back several generations.

On the advice of Roger Fry and others he bought French Impressionists and C\u00e9zannes and took out a lease on the best Robert Adam house in London, Home House, 20 Portman Square, in which to display them - a novel and stunning combination. His example was emulated by his younger brother Stephen, who converted the medieval ruins of Eltham Palace into an Art Deco mansion. Samuel Courtauld was the real Maecenas of the trio, and when his wife died in 1931, he made over the house in Portman Square, together with the pictures, for the use of the new institute until such time as permanent accommodation could be found for them.

Over the next couple of decades Samuel set about modernising and expanding the company. He purchase watermills at Braintree, Bocking and Halstead and converted them for textile production. It appears that lack of capital restricted Samuel's ambitions. In the early years he frequently had to enter partnerships, often with his younger brothers, in order to raise finance. From time to time he also had to lease, or even sell, one or other of the company's mills. Nevertheless, the business survived and finally flourished.  Samuel eventually regained control of the mills at Braintree, Bocking and Halstead, and by 1850 the firm employed over 2,000 people in its three mills.", "The Hall was not the only feature of the village that Samuel Courtauld changed after moving to the village. He built new homes for many of those who worked on the estate. These can be found on the eastern side of the main road through the village, in the form of pairs of semi-detached cottages called Park Cottages. Courtauld also paid for the erection of the Reading and Coffee Rooms at the southern end of Park Cottages, and a new village school on the western side of the main road. Courtauld's motives may not have been entirely altruistic. The school was almost certainly built as a result of the movement to make education compulsory; a movement which resulted in the 1870 Education Act which made education up to the age of 13 compulsory. The school, the Reading and Coffee Rooms and Park Cottages lie well to the east of the Hall, screened off from the Hall by a belt of trees. It is likely that, before Park Cottages were built, many of the estate workers lived along Church Lane, close to the parish church and within sight of the Hall, so by building these new homes and facilities he also improved the view from the south side of the Hall."]}, {"page": "George Courtauld (industrialist, born 1802)", "response": ["He was born in Pebmarsh, Essex in 1802, the younger son of George Courtauld and Ruth Minton.Proceedings of the Huguenot Society of London: Volume 11.
