The islands were connected by braces and the bridge was mounted on top of the bracing, which left a clear height of  for the aircraft on the flight deck. Fairly early in the design process, the decision was made to delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.Friedman, pp. 62, 65"]}, {"page": "Brodick Castle", "response": ["William, 11th Duke of Hamilton married in 1843, Princess Marie of Baden, youngest daughter of  the Grand Duke of Baden and St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais, adopted daughter of Napoleon Bonaparte.
