She married Lewis Hay and upon his death in 1800 she emigrated to Pau where she died in 1843. She corresponded with the poet between 1787 and 1792 although most of these letters were destroyed. One of his last completed works,\u201cFairest Maid on Devon Banks\u201d, may have been written with her in mind, however her cousin Charlotte Hamilton is the stronger contender.", "link_mentions": []}}
