Several players from before the war, including Warwick Armstrong, Charlie Macartney, Charles Kelleway, Warren Bardsley and the wicket-keeper Sammy Carter, were instrumental in the team's success, as well as new players Herbie Collins, Jack Ryder, Bert Oldfield, the spinner Arthur Mailey and the so-called \"twin destroyers\" Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald. The team continued its success on the 1921 tour of England, winning three out of the five Tests in Warwick Armstrong's last series. The side was, on the whole, inconsistent in the latter half of the 1920s, losing its first home Ashes series since the 1911\u201312 season in 1928\u201329."]}, {"page": "Bill Woodfull", "response": ["Upon returning to Australia, Woodfull established his partnership with Ponsford, and in 1926\u201327 Shield season, they put on a record-breaking 375-run opening stand, setting up a world record first-class team score of 1107. Woodfull was appointed as vice-captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928\u201329 home Ashes series following a spate of retirements. He carried his bat in a record-breaking first Test defeat. Although England easily won 4\u20131, Woodfull scored three centuries, and added his best first-class score for 275 not out. Woodfull reluctantly became captain in 1930 when Ryder was dropped, and his team was derided as the worst Australian squad to tour England. It was the youngest squad to leave Australia, prompting commentators to label the team \"Woodfull's kindegarten\". After losing the first Test, Woodfull scored a century as Australia levelled the series and they won the fifth Test to regain the Ashes. Woodfull ended the tour with six first-class centuries. In 1931\u201332 Woodfull had his most successful Test series in his career, against South Africa, scoring 421 runs at 70.17, including his Test highest score of 161.", "Woodfull was appointed as vice-captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928\u201329 home Ashes series.Haigh and Frith, p. 56. The Australian board had spent a great deal of time arguing over whether Woodfull or Victor Richardson should be Ryder's deputy, before realising that he selectors had omitted the latter.Harte and Whimpress, p. 312. With six members of the team that played in the last Test in 1926 having retired, Australia would field and young and inexperienced team. Woodfull prepared for the Tests with an unbeaten 67 for Victoria in a drawn tour match against Percy Chapman's touring Englishmen.", "After the heavy 4\u20131 defeat in the previous Ashes series, captain and fellow Victorian Jack Ryder was omitted altogether from the 1930 Ashes tour, and Woodfull appointed captain. Ryder was one of the three selectors and advocated his own retention, but his two colleagues had voted him off.Haigh and Frith, p. 58. At first, Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job, feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder. When he was informed that Ryder was not even touring, Woodfull only agreed after a ballot was organised. He was unanimously selected by the board.Harte and Whimpress, p. 322. Woodfull had limited leadership experience and in his brief captaincy duties had been the first captain to declare his team's second innings in Shield history."]}, {"page": "Keith Miller", "response": ["After returning to Australia, Miller played against Bradman in a testimonial match in 1948\u201349. Miller bowled three consecutive bouncers at Bradman, dismissing him with the last of the short-pitched deliveries for 53.Perry, p. 261.Whitington, p. 163. Bradman was angered by Miller's bowling. One week later, the squad to tour South Africa in the following season was announced, and Miller was omitted, despite being ranked as the best all rounder in the world.Perry, p. 262. During the Australian season, which was a purely domestic one, he had scored 400\u00a0runs at 33.33 and taken 11\u00a0wickets at 24.09. He scored one century against Queensland during the season, as well as a 99 against Victoria at the SCG.Perry, p. 263. The surprise omission led to much conjecturing about the reasoning.Pollard (1990), p. 26. One was that Miller had stated during the season that he did not want to bowl, so the selectors only considered his batting performances. Another was that Miller's bouncing of Bradman had provoked his former captain into voting against him at the selection table. Rumours circulated that new captain Lindsay Hassett did not want Miller on the tour because he was undisciplined, which Hassett denied.Whitington, p. 164. Another was that Jack Ryder, the Victorian selector and former Australian captain, had voted against Miller in retaliation for his move to New South Wales.Perry, pp. 263\u2013264. Both Bradman and Chappie Dwyer claimed they voted for Miller, leading Miller to quip \"somebody's telling lies\", as there were only three on the selection panel."]}, {"page": "Victoria cricket team", "response": ["Victoria has featured a significant number of cricketing greats, such as Warwick Armstrong, Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford, Neil Harvey, Hugh Trumble, Lindsay Hassett, Dean Jones, Jack Blackham, Jack Ryder, Bill Lawry, Bob Cowper, Shane Warne, Keith Miller and Ian Redpath.
