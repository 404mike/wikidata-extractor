Much of Ford's early success came with portrait heads or busts. These were considered extremely refined, showing his subjects at their best and led to him receiving a number of commissions for public monuments and statues, both in Britain and overseas. Ford also produced a number of bronze statuettes of free-standing figures loosely drawn from mythology or of allegorical subjects. These 'ideal' figures became characteristic of the New Sculpture movement that developed in Britain from about 1880 and of which Ford was a leading exponent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Marlowe", "response": ["A Marlowe Memorial in the form of a bronze sculpture of The Muse of Poetry by Edward Onslow Ford was erected by subscription in Buttermarket, Canterbury in 1891.

His next major work was again an innovation in terms of size: The Fawcett memorial (1885\u201387) featured a bronze bust of politician Henry Fawcett above seven small detailed figures of around fifteen inches, which individually represented Fawcett's virtues. The memorial received praise from critics when it was unveiled at Westminster Abbey on 29 January 1887. By then Gilbert had been commissioned to produce another memorial, this time for Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, which was placed in the Great Hall at Winchester Castle. From the late 1880s to the mid-1890s he was in his most creative period. He diversified into goldsmithing and damascening, making an epergne (1887\u20131890) given to Queen Victoria by officers of the British Army and a chain for the mayor of Preston (1888\u20131892). Gilbert produced medals, such as the cast bronze portrait of Matthew Ridley Corbet (1881) and the struck bronze medal marking 50 years of the Art Union of London (1887). He also created spoons, cups, dishes and jewellery; many of his designs can be seen in the collection of Stichting van Caloen on display at Loppem Castle. Marion Spielmann, a contemporary art critic, wrote in 1901 \"his taste is so pure, his genius so exquisitely right, that he may give full rein to his fancy without danger where another man would run riot and come to grief\"."]}, {"page": "Rowland Hill", "response": ["In London a bronze statue by Edward Onslow Ford, also made in 1881, stands in King Edward Street.

Edward Prior wrote in November 1883,  ", "This comment was confirmed in 1900 when the government recruited guild members Thomas Graham Jackson, William Blake Richmond, Edward Onslow Ford, and Walter Crane to the Council for Advice on Art, and they reorganised the Royal College of Art in line with Art Workers' Guild ideals. In 1902, on retiring from the Master's position, George Frampton stressed that only properly qualified candidates should be elected to the guild, and in 1905 the membership election system was amended. By this time the membership had grown to 235. Frampton had also recommended that the guild set up a benevolent fund for hard up members, which became known as the Guild Chest. However Frampton caused controversy in 1915, calling for Karl Krall, a German-born member, to have his membership revoked due to his nationality during World War I. The guild voted by a one vote majority to allow Krall to keep his membership, so Frampton resigned. Krall was so upset by the debates that led to the vote that he also resigned and asked that he never be contacted by the guild again."]}, {"page": "1901 in art", "response": ["* December 23 \u2013 Edward Onslow Ford, English sculptor (b. 1852)"]}, {"page": "Douglas Freshfield", "response": ["Freshfield died at Wych Cross Place, Forest Row, Sussex.
