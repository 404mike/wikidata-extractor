He was restricted to cup appearances in the first part of the 2017\u201318 season, despite expecting a better opportunity when Csaba L\u00e1szl\u00f3 replaced Ray McKinnon as manager in November 2017, although he explained that the change in management had little effect on him as he spent most of his time at Tannadice with goalkeeping coach Stuart Garden. Mehmet eventually staked his claim as first-team goalkeeper towards the end of that season, as United defeated Dunfermline Athletic in the play-off quarter-finals but had to be substituted for Harry Lewis just under an hour into the second leg, after he injured himself celebrating Scott McDonald's equalising goal. Manager Laszlo stated that \"this was the funniest thing he had seen in football and was really stupid\". Mehmet signed a new one-year contract with Dundee United in May 2018, however the torn cruciate ligament injury he sustained in the play-offs left him unable to feature during the first half of the 2018\u201319 season."]}, {"page": "Garden (surname)", "response": ["* Stuart Garden (born 1972), Scottish football player and manager"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Scottish Professional Football League", "response": ["| Stuart Garden(Montrose)"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Professional Football League monthly award winners", "response": ["| Stuart Garden(Montrose)"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Ross County F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Stuart Garden"]}, {"page": "Ross County F.C.
