Around 1800, one of his descendants, John Vivian (1750\u20131826) of Truro, became managing partner in the copper works at Penclawdd and Loughor owned by the Cheadle Brasswire Company of Staffordshire, and thus the first of the Vivian family to settle in Swansea. His son John Henry Vivian (1785\u20131855) continued and expanded the business, eventually owning copper mining, copper smelting and trading businesses in Swansea (Vivian & Sons), Liverpool, Birmingham and London. Between 1832 and 1855 he sat as Member of Parliament for Swansea District.Burke (1928) His brother Hussey Vivian (1775\u20131842) meanwhile pursued a military career in the British cavalry and commanded the 6th Brigade of the Earl of Uxbridge's Cavalry Division in the Battle of Waterloo. General Hussey Vivian was created a Baronet of Truro in the County of Cornwall in 1827, and Baron Vivian, of Glynn and of Truro in the County of Cornwall, in 1841. After John Henry Vivian's death in 1855, his sons Henry, Arthur and Richard continued to run the family business and sit as Members of Parliament for Swansea. Through their enterprises in the area, the Vivian family did much to develop Swansea into a city, in much the same way as the Marquesses of Bute drove the development of Cardiff.
