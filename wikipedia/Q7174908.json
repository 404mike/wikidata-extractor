As with the other Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, he did not take his seat in the British House of Commons, sitting instead in the revolutionary First D\u00e1il, which met in the Mansion House, Dublin in January, 1919.\nHe was elected in the 1921 general election to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland for the new Donegal constituency, but he and the other Sinn F\u00e9in members again declined to take their seats, sitting instead in the Second D\u00e1il.At the 1922 general election, he was returned to the Third D\u00e1il as a pro-treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TD, and re-elected at the 1923 general election for the new Cumann na nGaedheal Party. He resigned his seat on 1 August 1924, and at the resulting by-election on 20 November 1924 was won by the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate Denis McCullough, who had been president of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) during the Easter Rising of 1916.", "link_mentions": {}}}
