It includes Benson Court, Mallory Court and Buckingham Court, and consists almost exclusively of student accommodation. The whole area of the Village was gradually developed over a period of 45 years by three different architects, Harry Redfern, Sir Edwin Lutyens and David Roberts. The first building to be developed was Mallory Court B (1925\u201326) and the last was the new Buckingham Court building (1968\u201370). Lutyens had an original plan which involved demolishing many existing buildings in the area and constructing new buildings that matched the general look and feel of the college's main site, but this plan was scrapped due to insufficient funding and the only part of Lutyens' plan that was realised was the Lutyens building."]}, {"page": "List of Old Abingdonians", "response": ["* Harry Redfern (1861\u20131950), architect"]}, {"page": "State Management Scheme", "response": ["The scheme also involved the refurbishment of public houses, and the demolition and replacement of substandard premises.
