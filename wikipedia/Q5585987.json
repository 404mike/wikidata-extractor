He became known as a socialite in English high society, and sported a playboy image amongst the British press and paparazzi due to his \"non-stop partying\" at London nightclubs such as Annabel's and Tramp, though he claims to have hated English pubs and never drank alcohol. British heiress Sita White, daughter of Gordon White, Baron White of Hull, became the mother of his alleged lovechild daughter, Tyrian Jade White. A judge in the US ruled him to be the father of Tyrian due to his failure to appear in court, but Khan has denied paternity and asked for the case to be open in Pakistani courts. Later in 2007, Election Commission of Pakistan ruled in favour of Khan and dismissed the ex parte judgment of the US court, on grounds that it was neither admissible in evidence before any court or tribunal in Pakistan nor executable against him. About his lifestyle as a bachelor, he has often said that, \"I never claim to have led an angelic life.\""]}, {"page": "De Aston School", "response": ["* Gordon White, Baron White of Hull, co-founder of Hanson plc"]}, {"page": "Lord White of Hull", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gordon White, Baron White of Hull"]}, {"page": "Baron White of Hull", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gordon White, Baron White of Hull"]}, {"page": "Gordon White", "response": ["* Gordon White, Baron White of Hull (1923\u20131995), British businessman"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 1995", "response": ["*Gordon White, Baron White of Hull, 72, British-American peer and industrialist."]}, {"page": "Johnny Gold", "response": ["Gold usually returned home from the club at around 5.00 am to take his two Alsatian dogs for a walk. He established a Los Angeles branch of Tramp in the 1980s.  In 1995, Gold attended the funeral of Gordon White, Baron White of Hull in his capacity, The Times said, as an owner of one of \"London's most fashionable nightclubs for the outrageously rich\". In 1998, he sold his stake in Tramp to Edinburgh-based property firm Caledonian Heritable. He continued as an employee of the club for five years as \"greeter-in-chief\", as he was the only person who knew all the club's members personally.  He received the 2000 Bacardi London Club and Bar Awards outstanding achievement award. There was some concern among members ahead of the 2001 publication of his memoir  Tramp's Gold but he maintained his discretion and it caused no scandal. The foreword to the book was written by Tramp member Michael Caine. Gold explained that his secret to success was \"to treat the celebrities as ordinary people, and the ordinary people as celebrities\"."]}]}}
