His consistent and energetic performances also earned him All-Star awards in 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2010.There was controversy surrounding his participation in the Tyrone team leading up to the Championship in 2011, and he ruled himself out of matches in the National Football League with rumours circulating that he had announced his retirement. Towards the end of April, however, he pledged to commit to the team for the remainder of the year, explaining that he needed time to assess if he \"had the hunger\" to go for another season.\nJordan announced his retirement from intercounty football on 2 November 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mickey Harte", "response": ["Harte's and Tyrone's third All-Ireland SFC winning campaign began with a quarter-final loss to Down in the 2008 Ulster SFC. Entering the All-Ireland SFC qualifiers again, the county advanced to the 2008 All-Ireland SFC final against a Kerry team then bidding to win three consecutive titles. Kerry did not. Despite Peter Canavan's retirement, Mulligan's disciplinary problems and O'Neill's on-off retirement through injury, Tyrone won a third All-Ireland SFC title. Harte deployed Justin McMahon to effectively deal with Kerry's Kieran Donaghy (a forward who had become more prominent since the 2005 final), while the half-back line of David Harte, Conor Gormley and Philip Jordan outperformed expectations and Cavanagh scored five points from play. Eamonn Sweeney reckoned 2008 to be \"the supreme managerial achievement of Harte's career\"."]}, {"page": "Chris Johnson (footballer, born 1976)", "response": ["In the 2005 International Rules series, Johnson was named co-captain along with Andrew McLeod.
