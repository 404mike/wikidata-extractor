Having spent years studying music and playing clubs, he scored a hit with his first release, \"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\", in 1979. It was followed by a number of new wave singles, before he moved to more jazz-inflected pop music and had a Top 10 hit in 1982 with \"Steppin' Out\". Jackson is associated with the 1980s Second British Invasion of the US. He has also composed classical music.

Released in August 1990, Persistence of Time was written and recorded during a period of turmoil for Anthrax, as Ian had recently been divorced from his first wife, and the middle of the recording session was interrupted by a fire that caused the band to lose more than $100,000 worth of gear and their rehearsal studio. The band members also claimed it was during this period that there were talks of potentially working with a different singer, a situation that Belladonna was unaware of at the time. Considered by fans to be their serious effort, Persistence of Time was darker, more technical and more progressive than the band's previous work, striking a chord with metal fans wary of Anthrax's \"silly\" side. The most successful single from the album was a cover of Joe Jackson's \"Got the Time\", which Jackson said he enjoyed. Persistence of Time was certified gold by the RIAA in early 1991, and the band toured for nearly two years to promote the album, opening for Iron Maiden on their No Prayer for the Dying tour in Europe and North America, and appearing on the Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Slayer and opening act Alice in Chains."]}, {"page": "Paul Kelly (Australian musician)", "response": ["His next album Wanted Man, released in 1994, reached No.\u00a011.
