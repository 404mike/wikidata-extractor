He was given the name 'Chufty' by his friends at University, due to Ashby's frequency of using the term \"chuffed\".\nAshby picked up poker at his local tennis club, as well as playing for pennies with his father. In the mid nineties, he played his first tournament, a \u00a310 Stud tournament. A few years later, he earned entry into the Aussie Millions. After he bust from the first tournament, he put his entire $4,000 bankroll on the line in a cash game and spun it up to $100,000. By the end of the week, he had lost it all.\nAshby's first recorded win came at the 2001 Grosvenor UK Open in Luton when he won \u00a310,500 in the \u00a3100 Pot Limit Seven Card Stud Event. Since then, he's accrued over half a million dollars in live tournament winnings including final table finishes at the 2007 Manchester GUKPT and the 2009 Aussie Millions, the latter of which earned him A$150,000 for his seventh-place finish.\nHowever, Ashby openly admits that he needs to work on his live game, and is much better known as an online player, in particular on Black Belt Poker where was recently acquired as one of their sponsored pros in September 2010. Ashby can often been seeing playing on the site in some of the highest stakes available, and against many of the biggest names in poker.\nAshby's favoured game is Omaha and he is good friends with fellow Omaha specialist Ben Grundy. For a while, they played in the same games but eventually realised that it was a pointless exercise and decided to avoid each other from there on in. In addition to Grundy, Ashby considers France's David Benyamine to be the best Omaha player in Europe, although he cites Phil Ivey as the only player he would consider sitting out against.In July 2009, Ashby emerged as online poker's biggest cash winner when he earned a total of $1,824,074 over the four-week period. This success garnered him much interest, in particular on the Two Plus Two forums where the nosebleed stakes are avidly followed.\nOn 13 June 2010 Ashby won the World Series of Poker Event #21, a $1,500 seven card stud event, winning $140,467 in the process. He followed that success less than two weeks later by finishing 2nd in World Series of Poker Event #43, the $10,000 H.O.R.S.E. World Championship, netting him $378,027 in winnings.\nOn 24 September 2010 Ashby won Event #54 of the World Championship Of Online Poker, the $2,100 Pot Limit Omaha 6-max event. He was successful out of a field of 480 players, collecting his first WCOOP bracelet along with $185,760 in winnings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John D. Imboden", "response": ["As the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 appeared ready to pass the ordinance of secession, ex-Governor Henry Wise called a meeting of several militia commanders, Capt. A.M. Barbour (former civil superintendent of the Harper's Ferry Arsenal) and Richmond Enquirer editor Nat Tyler, to plan to capture the U.S. Army arsenal at Harpers Ferry. Imboden attended, as did Capt. John A. Harman of Staunton's infantry militia, as well as cavalry militia captains Turner and Richard Ashby of Fauquier County and Oliver R. Funsten of Clarke County. Imboden telegraphed Staunton's militia companies to meet in Staunton at 4p.m. on April 17 for orders. The group arranged railroad transportation to Charles Town about 8 miles from the Harpers Ferry arsenal. However, Governor John Letcher refused to authorized the action until the secession ordinance passed. As soon as it did, A.M. Barbour went to Harpers Ferry and publicly informed the workmen. Then, the evening after the secession ordinance passed, 360 men started out to capture the arsenal, defended by U.S. Army Lt. Roger Jones with 50 soldiers and about 15 volunteers. Vastly outnumbered, they attempted to set fire to the buildings and equipment as they retreated north to Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  Imboden's artillery had set up on the heights above the arsenal, but did not see further action, although Imboden later bragged about converting some of the captured horse carts to caissons. Virginia militia Major General Kenton Harper (of Staunton) then secured the towns, and on April 27, Major Stonewall Jackson arrived to organize the militia into regiments."]}, {"page": "Crown Australian Poker Championship", "response": ["| 7th ||  Richard Ashby || $150,000"]}, {"page": "World Championship of Online Poker", "response": ["|  CHUFTY (Richard Ashby)"]}, {"page": "Neil Channing", "response": ["From 2009 until early 2014, he was a sponsored pro at Blackbeltpoker.com alongside bracelet-winner Richard Ashby."]}]}}
