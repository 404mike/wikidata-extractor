His mother, the Hon.

Henry Jerome, his daughter, wife, parents, one brother, and nephew were all buried in the family vault in Harlington's churchyard.Just outside the parish of Harlington at Goulds Green there was a house which the De Salis renamed Dawley Court, and lived there from 1835 until 1929 when it was sold and then demolished. Peter de Salis (1738-1807) acquired the site of Dawley House in 1797.
