Between 2005 and 2006, Parker served as deputy commanding general of Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq, before appointment to General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, in which role he had the responsibility of overseeing the withdrawal of troops from the streets of Northern Ireland for the first time in over thirty years.\nWhile on holiday in 2009, Parker and his wife received news that their son, Harry, a captain with The Rifles, had been seriously wounded in Afghanistan. Harry lost both legs as a result of a roadside bomb attack while leading his patrol. Parker later gave interviews about the ordeal the family went through with Harry's injuries, calling the experience \"foul\". Later the same year, Parker himself deployed to Afghanistan on a twelve-month tour, becoming the commander of the British forces in the country and deputy commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), second in command to American General Stanley A. McChrystal. In June 2010, McChrystal was relieved of his command of ISAF by President Barack Obama, leaving Parker as acting commander of ISAF for just over a week until General David Petraeus was confirmed as the new commander.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "International Security Assistance Force", "response": ["* On 23 June 2010, Lieutenant General Sir Nick Parker, British Army, former deputy commander of ISAF, assumed interim command after the resignation of General McChrystal."]}, {"page": "Aide-de-camp general", "response": ["| General Sir Nick Parker || 29 October 2010 || 25 May 2013 ||"]}, {"page": "20th Armoured Brigade Combat Team (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* 1997\u20131999 Brigadier Nick Parker"]}, {"page": "Chitterne", "response": ["*General Sir Nick Parker, soldier"]}, {"page": "Headquarters Northern Ireland", "response": ["*Lieutenant General Nick Parker 2006\u20132007"]}, {"page": "Commander-in-Chief, Land Forces", "response": ["|Sir Nick Parker", "|Sir Nick Parker"]}, {"page": "Philip Haythornthwaite", "response": ["Haythornthwaite is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and a Member of the British Commission for Military History.Royal Historical SocietyCommission for Military History In 2015 he was awarded a Certificate in Recognition of Lifetime Achievement jointly by the BCMH and the Peninsular War 200 organisation.Peninsular War 200 was the official UK organisation for the commemoration of the Peninsular War - President : General Sir Nick Parker"]}, {"page": "Gaza War (2008\u20132009)", "response": ["Hamas called on all of Gaza's militant groups to abide by the truce, and was confident they would do so.\"Israel confirms Hamas ceasefire deal\", The Independent, 18 June 2008Israel and Hamas 'agree truce' BBC News 18 June 2008 'A Hamas official said he was confident all militant groups in Gaza would abide by the agreement, brokered by Egypt'.Nidal al-Mughrabi,  Hamas and Egypt to discuss truce, prisoner swap deal, Reuters 8 July 2008:' Hamas has called on all militant groups in Gaza to abide by the truce, but some factions have vowed to respond militarily to Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank, which is not covered by the truce.'Richard Boudreaux, Israel and Hamas OK Gaza truce Los Angeles Times June 18, 2008: \"As details of the accord were being worked out, Israeli aircraft attacked targets in southern Gaza, killing six militants in a car. Gaza militants then fired four mortar shells at Israel, but no one was hurt. Hamas officials said the violence would not prevent the truce from taking effect.\" They said all militant groups in Gaza had had promised to abide by it Defense Ministry Official Amos Gilad, the Israeli envoy to the talks, stressed that Israel demanded a ceasefire, meaning that even one single rocket fired will be seen as a violation of the agreement. He added that Egypt, on its side, was committed to preventing the smuggling activity from Gaza.\"Top Defense Ministry official: If Shalit is not released, Rafah stays closed\", Ynetnews, 16 June 2008 Gilad also said that Israel would hold Hamas responsible for attacks from Gaza. In a British Foreign Affairs Committee investigation, Dr Albasoos said that \"Unfortunately, on 4 November 2008, the Israeli army killed six Palestinians. I was leaving the Gaza Strip to come to the UK that same night. I remember when the Israeli army invaded the middle area of the Gaza Strip, killing six Palestinians. It was outrageous from their side to come and breach that ceasefire. I believe that Palestinian political factions, including Hamas, committed to that ceasefire and still have the intention to renew it in the near future, as soon as possible.\" In rebuttal, Ms Bar-Yaacov said that \"The Israelis had added a condition to the tahdia (truce), being concerned that Hamas was building tunnels to go under the Israeli border and kidnap more Israeli soldiers. The condition stated that if Hamas came within 500 metres of the border, they (the IDF) would attack and that is exactly what happened (on 4 November 2008).\" British barrister and professor Geoffrey Nice, and General Nick Parker, opined during a lecture that \"Building a tunnel was not a breach of the ceasefire but the armed incursion into Gaza definitely was.\".", "On 4 November 2008, Israel launched a cross-border military raid (variously also referred to as an attack / invasion / incident / military event / incursion) code named Operation Double Challenge into a residential area of Dayr al-Balah in central Gaza to destroy the opening of a cross-border tunnel concealed within a building 300 meters from the fence on the Gaza Strip border. Professor Sir Geoffrey Nice QC and General Sir Nick Parker observed that \"Building a tunnel was not a breach of the ceasefire but the (IDF) armed incursion into Gaza definitely was.\" Various outlets and authors reported this Israeli action as breaking the June truce.\"The Six Months of the Lull Arrangement\", Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center December 2008: 'A period of relative quiet between 19 June and 4 November: As of 19 June, there was a marked reduction in the extent of attacks on the western Negev population. The lull was sporadically violated by rocket and mortar shell fire, carried out by rogue terrorist organizations, in some instances in defiance of Hamas (especially by Fatah and Al-Qaeda supporters). Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire.... The escalation and erosion of the lull arrangement, 4 November to the time of this writing, December 172: On 4 November the IDF carried out a military action close to the border security fence on the Gazan side to prevent an abduction planned by Hamas, which had dug a tunnel under the fence to that purpose. Seven Hamas terrorist operatives were killed during the action. In retaliation, Hamas and the other terrorist organizations attacked Israel with a massive barrage of rockets.... During the second period a new dynamic was created which replaced the former relative calm: Hamas and the other terrorist organizations extended their attacks (rocket and mortar shell fire, IEDs and light-arms fire), the IDF operated to prevent attacks within the Gaza Strip (Israeli Air Force attacks, firing at terrorist squads within the Gaza Strip near the border), the terrorist organizations responded with barrages of rocket and mortar shell fire to retaliate for their losses and continued daily sporadic fire, in response to which Israel closed the border crossings, exerting pressure on Hamas and the Gaza Strip residents.... With the escalation in rocket and mortar shell attacks which began on 4 November, Israel began closing the crossings for longer periods. That led to shortages of basic goods in the Gaza Strip and to disruptions in the supply of various types of fuel (although electrical power was not cut off, since the plant in Ashqelon, which supplies 65% of the Gaza Strip's electricity, provided an uninterrupted flow of power).' According to the Telegraph, writing as Cast Lead began, the 4 November operation \"sealed the fate of the ceasefire\". Author Avi Shlaim wrote in 2015 that the \"...ceasefire had a dramatic effect in de-escalating the conflict.....It was Israel that violated the ceasefire. On 4 November 2008 the (IDF) launched a raid into Gaza and killed 6 Hamas fighters. That was the end of the ceasefire.\" and that Hamas had set a \"good example\" in respecting the ceasefire. The raid, according to Mark LeVine was unprovoked.Mark LeVine, \"Who will save Israel from itself?\", Al Jazeera 27 December 2009 Israel stated its aim was to destroy what it said was a tunnel on the Gaza-Israel border dug by militants to infiltrate into Israel and abduct soldiers. While accusing Hamas of plotting to dig a tunnel under the border, Israeli defense official was quoted in The Washington Times as separately acknowledging that Israel wanted to \"send Hamas a message\". According to Israel, the raid was not a violation of the ceasefire, but a legitimate step to remove an immediate threat. The 2009 Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict noted that \"the ceasefire began to founder on 4 November 2008 following an incursion by Israeli soldiers into the Gaza Strip\"."]}, {"page": "Nicholas Ralph Parker", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nick Parker"]}, {"page": "Adrian Bradshaw", "response": ["Bradshaw assumed the role of Commander Land Forces in succession to General Sir Nick Parker in January 2013.
