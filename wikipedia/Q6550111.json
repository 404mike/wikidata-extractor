Chord roots cannot be left to the bassist in this style. Chords themselves can be used sparsely or more densely, depending on both the individual player and his or her arrangement of a particular piece. In the sparse style, a full chord is often played only at the beginning of a melodic phrase. The denser chordal textures, in contrast,  approach chord soloing (see below). A third approach is to maintain a steady, busy bass-line, like a New Orleans pianist. Here, no more than two or three notes are played at a time, and the full harmony is indicated by arpeggiation. Exponents of this style often come from a country, folk or ragtime background, such as Chet Atkins, although it is also sometimes employed by straight-ahead jazz practitioners, for instance Martin Taylor. Chord-melody is often played with a plectrum (see Tal Farlow, George Benson and others); whereas fingerstyle, as practised by Joe Pass, George van Eps,  Ted Greene, Robert Conti, Lenny Breau or hybrid picking as practised by Ed Bickert, Laszlo Sirsom and others allows for a more complex, polyphonic approach to unaccompanied soloing.", "Jazz guitarists are not limited to single note improvisation. When working with accompaniment, chord solos are created by improvising chords (harmony) and melody simultaneously, usually in the upper register on strings 1,2,3 and 4. Wes Montgomery was noted for playing successive choruses in single notes, then octaves and finally a chord solo - this can be heard in his improvisation on the standard Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?). When playing without accompaniment, jazz guitarists may create chord solos by playing bass, melody and chords, individually or simultaneously, on any or all strings - such as the work of Lenny Breau, Joe Pass, Martin Taylor and others. This technique can also be incorporated into unaccompanied soloing: for instance Django Reinhardt's \"improvisations\", as he called his solo pieces."]}, {"page": "October 20", "response": ["*  1956   \u2013 Martin Taylor, English guitarist"]}, {"page": "St\u00e9phane Grappelli", "response": ["In 1973, British guitarist Diz Disley had the idea of prising Grappelli away from his \"lounge jazz\" format with piano players to play once again with the backing of acoustic guitars and double bass, re-creating a version of the \"Hot Club\" sound, but now with Grappelli as sole leader. Grappelli's reservations about returning to this format were dissipated following a rapturous reception for the \"new\" (old) format group at that year's Cambridge Folk Festival, after which he favoured the guitar-based trio (with double bass) for a series of increasingly successful concert tours around the globe. These tours would virtually occupy the remainder of Grappelli's life; away from the touring circuit, however, he also favoured numerous other instrumental combinations on record. Other guitarists in the British \"Diz Disley Trio\" providing his instrumental backing over the years included Denny Wright, Ike Isaacs, the Irish guitarist Louis Stewart, John Etheridge and Martin Taylor, while double bass was often provided by Dutchman Jack Sewing; in his later years, Grappelli also used a Parisian trio which included guitarist Marc Fosset and bassist Patrice Carratini.", "* St\u00e9phane Grappelli and Martin Taylor: We've Got the World on a String (1984, EMI)", "* St\u00e9phane Grappelli and Martin Taylor: R\u00e9union (1993, Linn)"]}, {"page": "Renault", "response": ["Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Renault's European advertising made extensive use of Robert Palmer's song \"Johnny and Mary\".

Earl Klugh (b. 1953) and Tuck Andress have also performed fingerstyle jazz on the solo guitar.

Before this, Grappelli had spent a number of years playing \"cocktail jazz\" in a Paris hotel. After a couple of \"warm up\" gigs in small folk clubs, they played together to an unexpectedly warm reception at the 1973 Cambridge Folk Festival with Denny Wright on second acoustic guitar. This began a collaboration between Grappelli and the Diz Disley Trio, sometimes billed The Hot Club of London, with tours of Australia, Europe, and the United States. Karl Dallas reported Disley as having \"single-handedly created a revival of interest in the music of Stephane Grappelli, which has taken him to Carnegie Hall, Australia, and New Zealand\" (the latter in September 1974). \"...the night he closed at the Palladium, he went to The Troubadour where he was booked later that night to perform his folk club act of idiocy and mayhem, keeping up the tradition he has built up over the past 20 years for delivering a shrewd mixture of musical brilliance and vocal insanity.\"Karl Dallas, Melody Maker, July 27, 1974, \"Disley - still making whoopee\" There were a few changes in line-up with Ike Isaacs, Louis Stewart, and John Etheridge alternating as second guitarist.

His replacement was a young Martin Taylor, who toured with Grappelli for ten years.
