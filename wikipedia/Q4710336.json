In June 1956, Goozee murdered his 53-year-old landlady, Mrs. Lydia Leakey, and her 14-year-old daughter, Norma, in the New Forest, Hampshire. Sentenced at the Hampshire Assizes, Winchester, to death by hanging on 26 November 1956, Goozee was given a reprieve four days before his execution was due to take place and was instead detained at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. Released in 1971, Goozee, who had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, was subsequently convicted of several further violent crimes, and in 1996 was convicted of indecently assaulting two girls, aged 12 and 13. Sentencing, Mr. Justice Gower said one of the two cases had been \"one of the most serious cases of indecent assault that I have ever had to deal with.\" \nIn October 2009, Goozee again became the subject of media interest when it was discovered that he had been released on compassionate grounds into the care of a nursing home for the elderly in Wigston, Leicester. While there, Goozee began a hunger strike and refused all food and medication. After developing a blood clot in his heart and complications from diabetes, he died on 25 November 2009. The coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Intimate Relations (1996 film)", "response": ["One day, Harold takes Marjorie and Joyce out for a picnic, although things are tense between the trio. Having sent her daughter Joyce away to play, Marjorie begins to ravish Harold, but Joyce returns and hits her mother with an axe. Harold panics and attempts to get Marjorie into the car to take her to hospital but, with blood streaming down her face, Marjorie manages to pick up a knife Harold drops and attacks him with it. Harold fights Marjorie off and stabs her to death. Joyce then tries to attack Harold and so he stabs her to death too. Finally, Harold stabs himself in the stomach in an attempt to emphasise that his actions were out of self-defence. It is said in the post-script to the movie the fact he, the real Albert Goozee, was sentenced to death for Joyce's murder, to revise the original decision made during the proceedings the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, with much demand and to further the matter the added charge of murdering Marjorie which had been included in the ruling was dropped because it was considered that there was not enough evidence suitable in the correct degree for this to stand.", "The film is based on the true story of Albert Goozee, who was put on trial in 1956 in England. He was arrested after his 53-year-old landlady, Mrs. Lydia Leakey, and her 14-year-old daughter, Norma, were found murdered. Goozee was tried only for the murder of the teenaged girl (Joyce, in the movie), convicted and imprisoned for life. The movie follows Goozee's own version of events, portraying him as an increasingly desperate young man caught in a love triangle between a mother and daughter, although as the only survivor there is no way of verifying if his version of the events was entirely truthful."]}, {"page": "List of films based on actual events", "response": ["* Intimate Relations (1996) \u2013 Canadian-British film based on the true story of Albert Goozee, who was put on trial in 1956 in England after his 53-year-old landlady, Mrs. Lydia Leakey, and her 14-year-old daughter, Norma, were found murdered"]}]}}
