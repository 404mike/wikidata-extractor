In June 1956, Goozee murdered his 53-year-old landlady, Mrs. Lydia Leakey, and her 14-year-old daughter, Norma, in the New Forest, Hampshire. Sentenced at the Hampshire Assizes, Winchester, to death by hanging on 26 November 1956, Goozee was given a reprieve four days before his execution was due to take place and was instead detained at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. Released in 1971, Goozee, who had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, was subsequently convicted of several further violent crimes, and in 1996 was convicted of indecently assaulting two girls, aged 12 and 13. Sentencing, Mr. Justice Gower said one of the two cases had been \"one of the most serious cases of indecent assault that I have ever had to deal with.\" \nIn October 2009, Goozee again became the subject of media interest when it was discovered that he had been released on compassionate grounds into the care of a nursing home for the elderly in Wigston, Leicester. While there, Goozee began a hunger strike and refused all food and medication. After developing a blood clot in his heart and complications from diabetes, he died on 25 November 2009. The coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes.", "link_mentions": {}}}
