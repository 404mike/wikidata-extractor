In it he has commentated on various aspects of the UK's governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 19 November 2020, he wrote an article with Tom Jefferson, an epidemiologist, in which he criticised the science behind wearing face masks to reduce transmissions of COVID-19. In the article he stated that; \u201cNow we have properly rigorous scientific research that we can rely on, the evidence shows that wearing masks in the community does not significantly reduce the rates of infection.\u201d His claim was met with criticism. Sonia Sodha of The Guardian argued that Heneghan had made scientific errors because he had misrepresented a Danish randomized controlled trial which studied infection transmission rates on people who wore face masks. This was because the Danish mask study was only focused on infection transmissions for those wearing masks, rather than on the overall community, so could not be used to make judgements on the effects of face masks on community wide transmission rates. Kamran Abbasi, executive editor of the British Medical Journal (BMJ), also criticised Heneghan's claims about face masks because he believed his interpretation of the Danish study was inaccurate. However, Abbasi stressed that he believed it was wrong that Heneghan's opinion be marked as \u201cfalse information\" on Facebook because, as he wrote in the BMJ, \"disagreement among experts, especially about interpretation of a study, is a common occurrence. It is the usual business of science.\""]}, {"page": "Gabriel Scally (physician)", "response": ["In May 2020, alongside Bobbie Jacobson from Johns Hopkins University and Kamran Abbasi from the British Medical Journal, Scally co-authored an editorial in the British Medical Journal titled \"The UK's public health response to covid-19\". They described the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic as \"too little, too late, too flawed\", with no adequate plan for community-based case-finding, testing, and contact tracing. Their findings were published in the New Statesman, and discussed in Medscape, the British Journal of Social Psychology and the Practice Nurse. Former director of public health, Marie Armitage, described the editorial as a \"clear, concise analysis and call to action\". In the same year he became a member of the Independent SAGE committee."]}]}}
