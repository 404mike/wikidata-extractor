Bj\u00f6rk went to M\u00e1laga and arranged to meet with flamenco guitarist Raimundo Amador. Bj\u00f6rk had originally intended to stay in M\u00e1laga only briefly, but later decided to record the entirety of Homogenic there. Bj\u00f6rk made a final trip out of the country before staying in Spain. As she had done since moving to London, Bj\u00f6rk returned to Iceland for Christmas. While there, she wrote more new songs for Homogenic, including \"J\u00f3ga\". Before returning to Spain to record, Bj\u00f6rk was sidetracked by a two-week worldwide press tour for the promotion of her remix album Telegram, which had just been released. After returning to the studio in Spain in late January, Bj\u00f6rk decided to end work with producer Nellee Hooper, who had produced both Debut and Post, as she felt they had \"stopped surprising each other\". Bj\u00f6rk had intended to produce the album alone, but sought collaborators including Dravs, Howie B, Guy Sigsworth and LFO's Mark Bell. Howie B had worked with Bj\u00f6rk on Debut and Post and Sigsworth had played harpsichord on Post. The American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan almost contributed to the production of Homogenic, but were unable due to their production on the album Wu-Tang Forever, which had taken longer than planned. Most of the melodies on the album were created by Bj\u00f6rk, who then composed string sections on a Casio keyboard and brought them to programmers who would add rhythmic patterns. Bj\u00f6rk had wanted to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums Debut and Post; Bell was credited for the majority of the album's production, including the songs \"Pluto\", \"Alarm Call\", and the bassline in \"J\u00f3ga\". Bj\u00f6rk stated that she \"trusts and respects what [Bell] does for me. If I were to say who has influenced me most it would be Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and Mark Bell\". Other unorthodox methods of recording were used during the production, including Bj\u00f6rk wanting to record outside on the porch and using non-professionals to help with production, such as Rebecca Storey, who was hired as a babysitter but added to the production staff after showing interest in the equipment.", "When the release of Homogenic was delayed by a month, its tour began with the audience not being familiar with the album's songs since it had not been released yet. The tour started at the beginning of September with a backing band that consisted only of Mark Bell and made stops in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Spain, and England. These shows were brief live shows lasting about half an hour consisting of only new material. Another tour took place in late October and lasted less than four weeks. Stops on this tour included Italy, Switzerland, France, England, Scotland, Germany, Ireland, and Denmark. In late November, Bj\u00f6rk was diagnosed with a kidney infection and while she was still healthy she was advised to take a three-week rest and was forced to cancel her American tour. In 1998, a North American tour with Radiohead was announced but canceled later due to difficulty of changing the stage between performances of the acts.

The group also often cited producer Mark Bell as a major inspiration in the making of Exciter as Gahan states that Mark Bell helped make him a more confident vocalist. On top of the electronic soundscapes, Depeche Mode also added elements of traditional blues, retro funk, progressive rock, and orchestral pop to its arrangements. Bell told Keyboard Magazine that they treated the acoustic and electronic sounds on the track \"Dream On\" the same. Gore felt that many songs of the album including \"When The Body Speaks\" have a 50s or 60s sound to them. \"Comatose\" was massively stripped down from the original demo since the band wanted a more minimalistic arrangement. \"Freelove\" was one of the final tracks to be completed on the album.", "In a positive review, NME wrote that \"Not many long-running groups could make an album this fresh and confident in their 20th year, never mind one which bridges timeless soulman crooning and underground techno\".

The song was first performed at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later included with the online promotional release of Homogenic; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Bj\u00f6rk and Mark Bell, \"Hunter\" features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission.", "The opening track of Homogenic, \"Hunter\" showcases the hybrid elements of strings and electronic backing beats through the album. It blends the live sound of the Icelandic String Octet \u2014orchestrated by Eumir Deodato\u2014, Yasuhiro Kobayashi's accordion and \"stuttering computer beats and beeps\" programmed by Mark Bell. Music journalist Evelyn McDonnell wrote \"the production showed Bj\u00f6rk's steeping in the cutting edge of electronic dance-music culture, her embrace of techno futurism, her time spent pulling all-nighters in London clubs. But the emotion was ancient, deeply human\". The song has been described as \"dark\", \"uncompromising\" and \"icy\". According to Ray Gun, \"Hunter\" evokes an eerie terrain with rolling techno beats and strings penetrating the air like a toxic fog. Bj\u00f6rk's vocals have been much celebrated in the track. They have been described as what \"[ties] the whole shebang together together [...]: full of reverberating menace and trepidation on the verses, then bursting into full-throated confession, layers of her voice pitching next to each other then cascading together\". The Wire wrote that Bj\u00f6rk's voice \"oscillates between steely-edged determination and uncontained freedom\".", "The song features \"militaristic\" electronic percussion programmed by Mark Bell. Bj\u00f6rk recorded the vocals, bassline and chord structure before Bell met her in Spain; after she explained how she wanted the percussion to sound, Bell recorded one take on a Roland TR-909 drum machine.

Jack Dickey of Deadspin considered \"Hunter\" one of the only two songs in the album where \"the instruments win out\" and wrote it \"is like Peter and the Wolf if, instead of a merciful hunter, Artemis were chasing the wolf.\" In a review for the single release, Keir Langley of AllMusic praised the rhythm and intensity of the track as a showcase of her collaboration with Mark Bell. The Wire's Louise Gray thought it was an \"extraordinary, mesmeric song.\" Also available at bjork.fr Evelyn McDonnell wrote \"I myself had used the prevalent critical category for Bj\u00f6rk uncategorizable amalgalm of styles: 'quirky.' There was nothing quirky about 'Hunter.'\" She also praised the song's originality and appeal to various types of listeners. Phil Freeman included \"Hunter\" in his list of songs which \"say something important about the state of music since 1979\u2014how venerable forms have changed;\" inspired by Greil Marcus' attempt to define rock and roll in Stranded (1978).

Steinberg and Donaldo Pereira Macedo identified elements of Donna Haraway's A Cyborg Manifesto in \"Hunter\". They state that, by assuming the position of authority in relation to the masculine other, Bj\u00f6rk challenges the traditional notions of femininity; and that by \"[leaving] to be the hunter,\" she \"disrupts the nature/culture binary of which Haraway speaks.\"", "Bj\u00f6rk presented the song \u2014and three more songs off the then-unreleased Homogenic\u2014 at the Tibetan Freedom Concert on 6 June 1997, as a sneak peek of the album.

The video shoot was originally going to take place in August 2007 in London, but it was eventually rescheduled to 11 October 2007 in New York City. The finished video was premiered on AOL on 6 December 2007. It opens with Mark Bell standing on a wall suspended above Bj\u00f6rk, playing a loom-shaped bass guitar. The strings from this guitar thread themselves through Bj\u00f6rk's megaphone, the helmets of several foot soldiers and then up through a pulley system before returning to the guitar. As the song progresses, the strings are spraypainted with several colours as they pass through the loop. All the people in the video including Bj\u00f6rk wear jumpsuits with the flags of Greenland and the Faroe Islands on their shoulders. The video is also available on the DVD compilation Michel Gondry 2: More Videos (Before and After DVD 1). A video was shot for the track \"Wanderlust\", directed by Encyclopedia Pictura and shot in New York City in stereoscopic 3D. The video involves \"a mixture of large scale puppeteering, live action acrobatics, miniatures, and CG\". The video was released in February 2008. Bj\u00f6rk said in an interview that she and ANOHNI had recorded themselves singing \"The Dull Flame of Desire\" on a green screen, then she sent the video to three directors who had taken part in the \"Innocence\" video contest, and the directors made \"The Dull Flame of Desire\" video together via e-mail.
