Slightly unusually for someone who played comparatively little, he was awarded his county cap in 1935. He was an amateur until after the 1933 season, but turned professional and scored 1,241 runs.  He ultimately thought he was too old for a professional career in cricket.\nBorn in Leeds, Yorkshire, and before he played county cricket, he turned out for Bingley and Leeds, whom he captained for a period. He also played badminton, a sport which he helped to promote in the United States.\nA right-handed batsman, he scored 1,355 runs in all first-class cricket at an average of 31.51, and a highest score of 128 against Kent.  His other century, 101*, came against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and he made seven scores of 50 or over.  He bowled just five balls, which went for four runs.\nDavidson died aged 49 on Christmas Day, 1954, at Prestwick Aerodrome, Ayrshire, Scotland, in an air accident.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kenneth Davidson", "response": ["* Kenneth Davidson (mathematician), professor of pure mathematics at the University of Waterloo", "* Kenneth Davidson (cricketer) (1905\u20131954), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "1954 Prestwick air disaster", "response": ["Twenty-eight people died including ten women and two children.
