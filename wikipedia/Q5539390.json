His older brothers James and David emigrated to South Australia (in 1853 and 1854 respectively) and had founded the highly successful grocery business of D. & J. Fowler in Rundle Street, Adelaide when in 1859 James died. George emigrated shortly after, arriving in Adelaide in July 1860 and was accepted as partner in the firm, which retained the name of  D. & J. Fowler. By 1865 business had grown to such an extent that they decided to confine themselves to the wholesale trade and opened a branch office in London and a head office in King William Street, Adelaide, of which George had control. His brother David died in England on 11 November 1881 aged 55, leaving George as the senior partner.\nFowler was elected, with John Cox Bray, to the seat of East Adelaide in the South Australian House of Assembly on 2 April 1878, and was re-elected in April 1881 but resigned on 7 June 1881, the day he was sworn in, and was succeeded by Thomas Johnson. He served as treasurer from 10 March 1881 to 10 May 1881 in William Morgan's ministry. Moderate on most subjects, he was a staunch advocate of free trade, opposing protective duties and unbalanced electorates. He castigated the raising of government loans without close study of movements in the London money market. In 1884 he failed to win re-election because of his temperance views (he was a teetotaller). He ran for election at the 1892 East Adelaide by-election but was defeated by John McPherson.\nFor a time, Fowler and fellow Scotsman William Murray, invested in a pastoral property, \"Pandurra\", west of Port Augusta. Fowler was active in the Sunday school movement; he served as deacon and treasurer and helped to form the Baptist Association and the aged ministers' fund. As president of the Baptist Union he aimed at dissolving church debts and started a building fund and a mission in India. He substantially funded the construction of the Glen Osmond Baptist Church and the reading room of the Glen Osmond Institute. Fowler died at his home \"Wooton Lea\" in Glen Osmond, South Australia on 1 October 1896; he was survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters, and left an estate valued at \u00a380,000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fowler (surname)", "response": ["* Francis George Fowler (1871\u20131918), English writer on English language, grammar and usage", "* George Fowler (politician) (1839\u20131896), South Australian politician"]}, {"page": "List of South Australian House of Assembly by-elections", "response": ["|George Fowler"]}, {"page": "George Fowler", "response": ["George Fowler may refer to:", "* George Fowler (politician) (1839\u20131896), South Australian businessman and politician", "* George Fowler (magistrate) (1858\u20131937), English solicitor and magistrate", "* George Fowler (footballer) (born 1998), English footballer", "* George Fowler (cricketer) (1860\u20131934), New Zealand cricketer"]}, {"page": "Treasurer of South Australia", "response": ["|align=center|  || data-sort-value=\"Fowler\" | George Fowler ||  || 10 Mar 1881 || 10 May 1881"]}, {"page": "List of Murray\u2013Darling steamboats", "response": ["| Marion || 110' \u00d7 23' || 1900\u2013 || W.
