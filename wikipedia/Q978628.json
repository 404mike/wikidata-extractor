A midfielder, he made 502 league and cup appearances in a 16-year career in the Premier League and English Football League and won five caps for the Republic of Ireland.\nHe began his career at Liverpool, making his senior debut in a UEFA Champions League qualifier in August 2004 in the first of his three appearances in that season's competition, which Liverpool would eventually win. He played a total of 17 games for Liverpool, though featured just twice in the Premier League, and spent 2006 on loan at Southampton and Wolverhampton Wanderers. He joined Wolves on a \u00a3250,000 transfer in January 2007. A first-team regular in the 2006\u201307 season, he lost his place the following season and spent the second half of the 2008\u201309 season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, before joining the club on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee in July 2009. Wednesday were relegated out of the Championship in 2010 and Potter left the club by mutual consent in June 2011.\nPotter signed with Milton Keynes Dons in June 2011 and would be named as the club's Player of the Year and on the PFA Team of the Year for the 2011\u201312 season. Promotion out of League One was secured with a second-place finish at the end of his fourth season at the club, though they would be relegated at the end of their maiden season in the Championship. He left the club at the end of the 2016\u201317 season and joined Rotherham United in June 2017. He suffered an achilles injury six months into his stay at Rotherham, which kept him out of action until the last game of the 2018\u201319 campaign.

Both player and manager hoped the responsibility might curb his hot-headedness and help him mature. Early in the new season, he confirmed that he wanted to play at Championship level, so was not going to sign a new contract until he knew whether MK Dons were to be promoted or not. The club's website highlighted his central midfield partnership with Darren Potter, a new signing with whom Gleeson had played for Wolves' reserves and in international football, as integral to the team's good start to the season, and the pair helped MK Dons come close to eliminating Premier League Queens Park Rangers in the third round of the FA Cup. He played in 39 of the 46 League One matches and scored 5 league goals as the team were rarely out of the play-off positions, but indiscipline remained an issue. On 6 March, he returned from suspension for his tenth yellow card, only to be sent off for kicking an opponent late in the home defeat to Yeovil Town. After a lengthy talk with the player, manager Robinson stated publicly that if Gleeson did not learn from his mistakes, he would not be offered another contract. He and Potter were both named in the Professional Footballers' Association's League One Team of the Year, and together with winger Luke Chadwick were among the top ten players as chosen by the League One managers."]}, {"page": "Alan McCormack", "response": ["McCormack's first exposure to international football came at schoolboy level.
