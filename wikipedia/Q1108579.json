He is Scotland's second player to be awarded the title of Grandmaster (GM), fulfilling its requirements in 1992 just after Paul Motwani. After achieving his three norms, he strained to get his rating up to the required 2500 level, and is possibly unique among Grandmasters in only achieving a published rating of 2500 some six years after being awarded the title. The FIDE regulations in force at the time stated that an 'intermediate' rating at any stage during an event would suffice, and that ratings between 2498.5 and 2500 would be rounded up, which is indeed what happened in 1992. He is also an International Master of correspondence chess since 1993 and International Master of chess problem solving since 2007.McNab played for Scotland in eighteen Chess Olympiads between 1980 and 2016, and won the Scottish Chess Championship in 1983, 1991, 1993 and 1995. He was also the Commonwealth champion in 1992. In 2012 and 2013 McNab won the British Problem Solving Championship.His opening repertoire is noted for its seemingly quiet fianchetto systems, and he has written a book on the fianchetto variation of the King's Indian Defence, and co-authored a book about the Pirc Defence with John Nunn. He is renowned as an expert on the endgame and has written a regular column for Scottish Chess magazine for a number of years.\nMcNab is a doctor of Mathematics, having studied for a DPhil at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Peter Neumann.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chess players", "response": ["* Colin McNab (Scotland, born 1961)"]}, {"page": "Pirc Defence", "response": ["*John Nunn and Colin McNab, The Ultimate Pirc (Batsford, 1998)"]}, {"page": "Modern Defense", "response": ["The Modern Defense (also known as the Robatsch Defence after Karl Robatsch) is a hypermodern chess opening in which Black allows White to occupy the center with pawns on d4 and e4, then proceeds to attack and undermine this \"ideal\" center without attempting to occupy it themself.

(Although norms now last a lifetime, the FIDE rule in place at the time saw them expiring after five years.) He just failed to reach the required number of points in a hastily organised tournament in Dundee days before the deadline, ironically, FIDE changed the rules shortly after this, and reset the expiry time for norms at six years. He duly achieved his final norm in 1992, and starred in a Grampian Television documentary called \"The Grandmasters of Dundee\" along with Colin McNab, who had also achieved the title by then."]}, {"page": "McNab", "response": ["* Colin McNab (born 1961), British chess Grandmaster", "* Colin McNab (footballer) (1902\u20131970), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Chess players", "response": ["Colin McNabnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "David Howell (chess player)", "response": ["In 2001, Howell came joint first at the European Youth Chess Championships in the Under 12 category and joint second at the World Youth Chess Championships in the same category.

In general, all teams with higher average rating playing on the first 28 tables met their Elo expectations and defeated their opponents. Russia, Azerbaijan, Poland and India scored perfect victories against Turkmenistan, Macedonia, United Arab Emirates and Costa Rica, respectively. The United States and China dropped half point, because American Sam Shankland critically blundered in his game against the Scot Colin McNab but somehow managed to survive and Chinese Wei Yi played a game with many oscillations against Belgian Nicola Capone that seemed he might have lost but ended in a draw. England faced difficulties in narrowly beating Indonesia 2\u00bd-1\u00bd after Luke McShane lost to Irwanto Sadikin and Michael Adams drew his 166-move game against Muhammad Lutfi Ali.
