Arsenal's performance improved after Wright's goal; Paul Merson, a quiet figure in the first half, influenced their play in the second. Ferguson responded to Arsenal's newfound impetus by substituting Giggs for Bryan Robson. This tweaked United's formation to 4\u20133\u20133; in spite of Ince's well-rounded performance, his partner Keane started to tire as the game went on and United's game therefore suffered. Keane was shifted onto the right to accommodate Robson, who brought control to United's play. In the meantime, Nigel Winterburn prevented Cantona from scoring, following good play by Kanchelskis. Arsenal's service to Wright and Campbell was infrequent throughout the second half, but both players tested Schmeichel in goal. McGoldrick came on for his Arsenal debut in the 74th minute, a versatile player, able to \"sweep, score from midfield or play wide\". Two minutes later, Seaman denied Keane from scoring with a one-handed save. United continued to attack and a move was broken down after Jensen's tackle brought Ince down in the Arsenal's penalty area. Gerald Ashby refused to award a penalty \u2013 \"the referee's decision otherwise was not supported by television replays\"."]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["Newcastle responded by beating Coventry City 4\u20130 at St James' Park. Despite the absence of Shearer and Ferdinand through injury, goals from Watson, Lee, Beardsley and Elliott saw the home side win comfortably in a match notable for an excellent performance from Asprilla and a performance from referee Gerald Ashby described by writer John Edwards as \"the most wretched performance I've ever seen from a top-flight official\". March concluded with a trip to Selhurst Park on 23 March 1997 to face Wimbledon. Another excellent Asprilla performance, this time capped with a second-half goal, was enough to secure a 1\u20131 draw though claims from Dalglish that the title was still a realistic proposition were mocked by Dons manager Joe Kinnear; indeed, the gap to Manchester United was by this time 11 points and one bookmaker had priced Newcastle at 33/1 to claim the title."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2001", "response": ["*Gerald Ashby, 52, English football referee."]}]}}
