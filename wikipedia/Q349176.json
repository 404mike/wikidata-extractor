On 14 January 2012, Hibs won their first league game under Fenlon, against Dunfermline. With the club still struggling, Fenlon decided to shake up the squad in January 2012 by releasing some players and replacing them with loan signings, including James McPake. The team's form improved and Hibernian made progress in the battle to avoid relegation. Furthermore, a late goal by Leigh Griffiths gave Fenlon's side a 2\u20131 victory against Aberdeen and a place in the 2012 Scottish Cup Final. Fenlon then guided Hibs to safety in the SPL, but they lost 5\u20131 in the Scottish Cup Final to Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts and Fenlon was sent to the stand by referee Craig Thomson late in the game."]}, {"page": "2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup", "response": ["|Craig Thomson (Scotland)"]}, {"page": "Hugh Dallas", "response": ["After Dallas was sacked there was concern from referees in Scotland that standards of officiating could drop.

The match was supposed to start at 20.50, but the start was postponed for more than half an hour because the visiting fans threw torches on the field, but also among the home spectators, and one fell very close to the home goalkeeper Viviani, so the referee decided to return the players to the locker rooms until the police bring order to the stadium.In the meantime, the police isolated Serbian fans in the stands and it seemed that the situation calmed down, so the match, after the appeal of the Serbian national team, started with a delay of 35 minutes. But after just a few minutes of play and new torches thrown into the pitch, Scottish referee Craig Thomson definitely stopped the match.On the eve of the match, a group of Serbian fans attacked goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovi\u0107 at the moment when the bus with Serbian players was heading towards the stadium. A more serious incident was prevented, but Stojkovi\u0107 refused to defend, so \u017deljko Brki\u0107 took his place in the first team.
