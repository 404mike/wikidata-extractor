He has also won three All Star Awards, and six Ulster All-Stars - the joint leader with Kieran McGeeney and Steven McDonnell.\nDooher played his club football for Clann na nGael.\nDooher was renowned for his hardworking playing style, often doing the gritty, unfashionable work, like picking up the ball in defence, to feed the forward players. He was also an accurate point scorer. Although he usually started in the half-forward line, his roaming nature meant he was rarely ever stationed there for very long. His contributions to the game did not go unnoticed by his teammates, as Se\u00e1n Cavanagh remarked in 2003 how \"I wouldn't be able to [play to my strengths] without Brian's workrate.\" In the same article, the Irish Examiner said, \"it would be no exaggeration to call him the hardest working footballer in Ireland.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "County Tyrone", "response": ["* Brian Dooher, former captain of the Tyrone senior football team"]}, {"page": "Strabane", "response": ["*Brian Dooher, member of the 2003, 2005 and 2008 All-Ireland winning Tyrone Gaelic football teams."]}, {"page": "Donemana", "response": ["*Brian Dooher, Tyrone All-Ireland-winning GAA captain "]}, {"page": "Ryan McMenamin", "response": ["In 2003 McMenamin helped Tyrone win the county's first ever All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.
