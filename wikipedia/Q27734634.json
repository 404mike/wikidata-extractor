Many of their recommendations would form part of the eventual Scout Network section and the structure it would take. Some of the national members involved in the project would go on to have prominent roles within the Scout Association; Tim Kidd was the National Co-ordinator of The Scout Network and is, as of 2020, the UK Chief Commissioner of the Scout Association while Craig Turpie, formerly the National Communications Manager for The Scout Network, is currently, as of 2020, Chairman to the World Scout Committee."]}, {"page": "Turpie", "response": ["*Craig Turpie"]}]}}
