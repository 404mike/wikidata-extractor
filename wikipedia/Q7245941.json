It is a branching, tuberous tender perennial  with dark purple, almost black, foliage.  This produces a stunning contrast with its scarlet flowers.  The plant was first bred by Fred Treseder, a Cardiff nurseryman. It was selected by and named to honour Joshua Pritchard Hughes, Bishop of Llandaff, in 1924 and won the RHS Award of Garden Merit in 1928.  The plant is about 1 m tall and flowers from June until September.
