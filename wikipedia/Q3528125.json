He played cricket for the United Services in 1935, against a strong Hampshire Club & Ground side, scoring 20 runs and taking four wickets. Manners served aboard the royal yacht Victoria and Albert at Portsmouth in 1936, though with King Edward unwilling to travel to Cowes, this left Manners with more shore time. He played for the Royal Navy as captain against the British Army cricket team in a two-day match at Lord's in July of that year, where he scored 23 and 47, impressing Christopher Heseltine, then president of Hampshire County Cricket Club, who recommended to Manners that he play for the county. He was allowed by the navy to play for Hampshire in August, making his debut in first-class cricket against Gloucestershire at the United Services Ground in the County Championship, scoring 81 runs in his first innings before he was dismissed by Reg Sinfield and thus narrowly falling short of becoming the first Hampshire batsman to make a century on their first-class debut. In the fortnight following this match, he made four further first-class appearances, scoring 212 runs at an average of 35.33. He headed Hampshire's batting averages in 1936 and sufficiently impressed future Test Match Special commentator John Arlott with his strokeplay, with some suggesting he had the technique for Test cricket."]}, {"page": "List of South Africa cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut", "response": ["*Christopher Heseltine"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Christopher Heseltine (1892\u20131914) : C.
