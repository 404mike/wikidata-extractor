Sound-stage works were completed at London's Pinewood Studios which included a detailed recreation of Greenwich Village. Kubrick's perfectionism went as far as sending workmen to Manhattan to measure street widths and note newspaper vending machine locations. Real New York footage was also shot to be rear projected behind Cruise. Production was followed by a strong campaign of secrecy helped by Kubrick always working with a short team on set. Outdoor locations included Hatton Garden for a Greenwich Village street, Hamleys for the toy store from the film's ending, and Mentmore Towers and Elveden Hall in Elveden, Suffolk, England for the mansion. Larry Smith, who had first served as a gaffer on both Barry Lyndon and The Shining was chosen by Kubrick to be the film's cinematographer. Wherever possible, Smith made use of available light sources visible in the shots such as lamps and Christmas tree lights, but when this was insufficient he used Chinese paper ball lamps to softly brighten the scene and/or other types of film lighting. The color was enhanced by push processing the film reels (emulsion) which helped bring out the intensity of the color.", "| Stanley Kubrick and Larry Smith", "| Larry Smith", "| Larry Smith"]}, {"page": "Larry Smith", "response": ["Larry Smith may refer to:", "*Larry Smith (puppeteer) (1938\u20132018), producer of children's programming and creator of the Larry Smith Puppets troupe", "*Larry Smith (musician) (born 1944), British drummer", "*Larry Smith (producer) (1952\u20132014), American record producer", "*Larry Smith (editor) (born 1968), editor of Smith Magazine and co-author of Six Word Memoirs", "*Larry Smith (cinematographer), British cinematographer", "*Larry Smith, fictional parent character in Wee Sing: The Best Christmas Ever!", "*Larry Smith (trade unionist) (1923\u20132005), British trade union leader", "*Larry Smith (Canadian politician) (born 1951), Canadian Senator, Canadian football player, president of the Montreal Alouettes", "*Larry Smith (American football coach) (1939\u20132008), college football coach", "*Larry Smith (racing driver) (1942\u20131973), 1972 Winston Cup Grand National Series Rookie of The Year", "*Larry Smith (running back) (born 1947), American football running back", "*Larry Smith (basketball, born 1958) (born 1958), professional basketball player", "*Larry Smith (basketball, born 1968), high school and college basketball player", "*Larry Smith (defensive tackle) (born 1974), American football defensive back"]}, {"page": "Satellite Award for Best Cinematography", "response": ["| Eyes Wide Shut || Larry Smith"]}, {"page": "Tom Hooper", "response": ["Hooper uses camera styles \"that encode the DNA of the storytelling in some way\" and will reuse and develop filming styles in successive productions.Hooper, Tom (21 January 2011). \"The King's Speech director Tom Hooper answers your questions \u2013 live!\". guardian.co.uk (Guardian News & Media).
