Chipzel happily obliged, and created a three-track chiptune soundtrack that was subsequently released as Super Hexagon EP. The soundtrack again included the track \"Courtesy\", as well as \"Focus\" from Chipzel's previous album Phonetic Symphony and a new track titled \"Otis\". Each track corresponded to a level in the game: \"Courtesy\" was used on the Hexagon level, \"Otis\" on the Hexagoner level, and \"Focus\" on the Hexagonest level. When a level in Super Hexagon is restarted, the track always starts off at a random place in order to keep players from feeling like they have to start back from the beginning every time.  Fittingly enough, the music that plays in the ending (lasting 60 seconds on Hyper Hexagonest) is a reversed and higher pitched version of Focus."]}, {"page": "Crypt of the NecroDancer", "response": ["The Xbox One version of the game added a sixth additional soundtrack by Chipzel.", "A free update to the PC version of the game was released on August 22, 2017, adding a seventh additional soundtrack by Masafumi Takada, consisting of arrangements from the Danganronpa franchise.
