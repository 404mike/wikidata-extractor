Soon after its opening, it began to exhibit architectural flaws. This led the cathedral authorities to sue Frederick Gibberd for \u00a31.3\u00a0million on five counts, the two most serious being leaks in the aluminium roof and defects in the mosaic tiles, which had begun to come away from the concrete ribs.

The cultural critic Jonathan Meades, in a 2020 article in The Critic, repeated Stamp's strictures and dismissed Scruton's praise, \"[a man] who had no eye\", as \"embarrassingly silly\"; while Stephen Bayley is among those who have attacked the close relationship between Terry and the Prince of Wales. In a column in The Guardian in 2009, Bayley mocked the Prince's circle of architectural advisers as, \"a coterie of fogeyish misfits, dreamers, forelock-tugging courtiers, DIY specialists, greasy pole-climbers [and] short-sighted antiquarians\", reserving particular scorn for Terry, \"a specialist in architectural pastiche [whose] modesty and art are in inverse proportion\"."]}, {"page": "Calderstones School", "response": ["*Stephen Bayley, architecture writer and Chief executive of the Design Museum from 1986 to 1989"]}, {"page": "Piet Mondrian", "response": ["Mondrian's work had an enormous influence on 20th century art, influencing not only the course of abstract painting and numerous major styles and art movements (e.g. Color Field painting, Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism), but also fields outside the domain of painting, such as design, architecture and fashion.
