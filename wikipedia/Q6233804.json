In a 223-run Warwickshire win, he made 21 in his only innings and bowled two overs without reward. He then appeared in the extraordinary game against Hampshire at Edgbaston in which Hampshire, having been bowled out for 15, made 521 following on and won by 155 runs.\n\nFox's personal contribution to the match was minimal, although he did take his maiden first-class wicket, that of William Shirley.\nFox played a few more times that season without notable success, and continued to appear sporadically for the next few summers. Although he took a career-best 4-27 against Worcestershire in 1926, it was only the following year that he started to play more regularly, appearing 18 times. He had a terrible season, however, claiming just four wickets at a woeful bowling average of 81.50, while his batting average was pushed above 20 only because of nine not outs in 17 innings. He did play two more games for Warwickshire in 1928, but after that he took the short journey to New Road to play for Worcestershire.\n1929, Fox's first season with his new county, was something of a mixed bag: his tally of 505 runs was higher than the aggregate of his career up to that point, and although he averaged only 15.78, he did hit 60 and 19 opening the batting against Glamorgan in late July. His bowling, however, was again unproductive: four wickets at 71. This, however, was followed by unquestionably the best season of Fox's career: in 1930 he scored 861 runs at 22.65 and took 16 wickets at 28.37.\nAfter this, Fox's career gradually declined. Although he was still capable of useful scores, such as the career-best 73 he made against Northamptonshire in May 1931, these were never very frequent and for the last three years of his career he struggled to push his batting average beyond the low teens. Nor could his bowling rescue him: he never again took more than five wickets in a season, and at an average of around 50 runs apiece he was simply too expensive.\nFox played his last first-class match at the end of 1933, against Yorkshire. In a drawn game he made 19 in his only innings and took the single wicket of Arthur Wood.\nHe was born in Selly Park, Birmingham; he also died in Birmingham, aged 57.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Fox", "response": ["John Fox, John Foxx, or John Foxe may refer to:", "*John Fox (baseball) (1859\u20131893), pitcher for Major League Baseball", "*John Fox (American football) (born 1955), American football coach", "*Tiger Jack Fox (John Fox, 1907\u20131954), American light-heavyweight boxer", "*John Fox (cricketer, born 1851) (1851\u20131929), English cricketer", "*John Fox (cricketer, born 1904) (1904\u20131961), English cricketer", "*John Fox (cricketer, born 1929) (1929\u20132016), English cricketer", "*John Fox (South African cricketer) (1929-2017), South African cricketer", "*John Fox (water polo) (born 1963), Australian water polo player", "*John Fox (hurler) (born 1892), Irish hurler", "*John Fox (footballer) (born 1940), Australian footballer for Geelong", "*John Fox (rugby union) (1921\u20131999), Scottish rugby union player", "*John Fox (congressman) (1835\u20131914), U.S. Representative from New York", "*John Fox (Newfoundland politician) (1818\u20131871), merchant and politician in Newfoundland", "*Tinker Fox (John Fox, 1610\u20131650), English Parliamentarian soldier", "*John Fox (biographer) (1693\u20131763), English biographer", "*John Fox (writer) (c. 1952\u20131990), American novelist and short-story writer", "*John Fox, Jr. (1862\u20131919), American journalist and novelist", "*John Fox (comedian) (1953\u20132012), American comedian", "*John Fox (composer, arranger, conductor), music conductor and composer, see Beautiful music", "*John Fox (statistician) (born 1946), British statistician", "*John Fox (railway engineer) (1924\u20132001), Canadian civil engineer", "*John Fox (1611\u20131691), Clerk of the Acatry to King Charles II", "*John Foxe (neuroscientist), Irish neuroscientist", "*John Foxe (1516\u20131587), English clergyman", "*John Fox ((died 1586), Member of Parliament for Aldeburgh", "*John Foxx (born 1948), English pop musician"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* John Fox (1922\u20131928) : J.
