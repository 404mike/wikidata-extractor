After an impressive season with a record breaking Consett side he was signed for nearby giants Newcastle United where he made 25 appearances.\nNoble signed for Swindon Town from Newcastle United in January 1968 for \u00a38,000 and made his debut as a substitute in a 3\u20130 win over Walsall at the beginning of February.\nIn the following season he scored 16 league goals and was the club's top scorer, but his main contribution was to the successful League Cup campaign. He played in every match en route to the Final. Noble scored four goals, including the extra time winner in the semi-final replay versus Burnley. He only discovered five years later that he had suffered a broken shoulder blade in that game.\nIn the final Swindon beat First Division giants Arsenal 3\u20131 in a great giant killing feat.\nHe was the club's top scorer again in 1969/1970 with 12 goals and once more in 1971/1972, with 14. He also scored in both the 1969 Anglo-Italian League Cup Final and the 1970 Anglo-Italian Cup Final where he lined up against Roma and Fabio Capello. (The Italian later stated that the experience of playing and losing to Swindon led to his enduring respect for the English game and the beginning of a long-term ambition to manage the English national side). Noble left Swindon at the end of the 1972/1973 season, when Burnley paid \u00a335,000 for his services.\nBurnley originally played him in the fullback position before eventually moving him up into midfield, and he became their top scorer for three of the following four seasons. He also became the team's penalty taker. Noble was a favourite with the Turf Moor supporters with his commitment, drive and goal scoring. Noble scored 63 goals in 243 appearances and was club captain for much of his seven-year stay at the club.In 1980, he moved to Blackpool where he continued a partnership with another ex-Burnley player, Paul Fletcher. At this time he also opened a sports shop in Burnley indoor market \u2013 Peter Noble Sport Ltd. \u2013 which he successfully ran with his family for nearly 20 years.Noble ended his career having scored every penalty he took. This record of 28 consecutive penalties is widely believed to be a world record. In 1985 a question about Noble's penalty kicks appeared in the first edition of the popular board game Trivial Pursuit.In 2006 at a special dinner at Turf Moor Noble, along with a number of other players, was officially declared a 'Burnley Football Club Legend' by the East Lancashire club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stan Ternent", "response": ["Immediately upon his appointment at Bloomfield Road, Ternent began to reshape the team, spending large sums on new players. Jack Ashurst was purchased from Sunderland for a then-club-record \u00a3132,400. Fellow newcomers included Dave Bamber, Colin Morris, Peter Noble and Tom McAlister. Despite the fresh faces, the Seasiders' fortunes didn't improve, and by early 1980 they were in the bottom half of the Third Division. Ternent was sacked on 1 February 1980, at the time becoming the club's shortest-serving manager in their history."]}, {"page": "1969 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||10 || Peter Noble"]}, {"page": "List of Swindon Town F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Peter Noble (14)"]}, {"page": "1969 Anglo-Italian League Cup", "response": ["|FW|| ||Peter Noble", "The second half was more evenly contested, and Swindon equalised through Peter Noble who sliced a chipped free-kick from John Smith just out of the grasp of the Roma goalkeeper, Alberto Ginulfi.

Both clubs were relegated in 1970\u201371; Burnley went down to the second tier, while Blackburn were relegated to the third tier. Burnley returned to the First Division two years later but upon relegation in 1975\u201376, they rejoined Rovers who had been promoted from the Third Division in 1974\u201375. Burnley again had the edge in the fixture, winning four of the six matches, with midfielder Peter Noble scoring in four of the games. Rovers went down again at the end of the 1978\u201379 season, but bounced straight back while Burnley moved into the opposite direction entering the Third Division for the first time at the end of 1979\u201380. Burnley won promotion in 1981\u201382 to set up a renewal of the fixture. The games in 1982\u201383 were both won by Rovers and would ultimately prove to be the last between them in the 20th century.
