Buckland was a right-handed batsman who bowled both right-arm off break and right-arm underarm fast. Buckland played the role of an all rounder.\nBuckland was educated at Marlborough College, where he was in the cricket XI. He matriculated at New College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1886, and played for the university XI. He made his first-class debut for Oxford University against Lancashire.\nBuckland spent the vast majority of his first-class career representing the university, where he played 27 matches 1884 to 1887, with his final first-class match for the university coming Cambridge University in 1887. In his 27 matches for the university, Buckland scored 739 runs at a batting average of 17.18, with three half centuries and one century which gave Buckland his career high score of 148 against Surrey in 1887. Further to his role as an all rounder, Buckland took 45 wickets for the university at a bowling average of 20.88, with three five wicket hauls and best figures of 7/17 against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1884. Buckland was also an impressive fielder, taking 22 catches.\nIn 1885 Buckland played his only first-class match for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Lancashire. In the same year Buckland made his debut for Middlesex against Yorkshire. From 1885 to 1888 Buckland represented Middlesex in nine first-class matches, with his final first-class match for the county coming against Nottinghamshire in 1888. Buckland scored 254 runs for the club at a batting average of 16.93, with a single half century which gave Buckland his highest score for the county of 51. With the ball Buckland took 27 wickets at a bowling average of 18.51, with one five wicket haul and best figure of 5/15. In the field Buckland took 20 catches.\nIn late 1886, Buckland toured North America with EJ Sanders' XI where he played in a number of matches, including two first-class matches against Philadelphia Cricket Club at the Germantown Cricket Club Ground.\nFollowing Buckland's final match for Oxford University, as mentioned above, he represented the Gentlemen in two Gentlemen v Players fixtures in 1887. The Gentlemen side was captained by W.G. Grace. The following year Buckland played a single first-class match for CI Thornton's XI against Cambridge University. During the same season Buckland played a single first-class match for Oxford University Past and Present against the touring Australians.\nSeven years later, in 1895 Buckland made his debut for Hampshire against Yorkshire. Buckland played four first-class matches for Hampshire in 1895, with his final first-class match coming against Sussex. Buckland scored 116 runs for Hampshire at a batting average of 14.50, with one half century and a highest score of 73. With the ball Buckland took 9 wickets at a bowling average of 23.44, with best figures of 5/30.\nIn Buckland's overall first-class career he played 48 first-class matches, scoring 1,414 runs at a batting average of 18.12, with six fifties and one century, a score of 148. With the ball, Buckland complemented his ability with the bat by taking 110 wickets at a bowling average of 19.62, with eight five-wicket hauls and taking ten wickets in a match once. Buckland's best figures were 7/17. In the field Buckland took 54 catches.\nBuckland never reached the level of international cricket, but was regarded as one of the best all rounders at Oxford. Outside of cricket Buckland was a Master at Winchester College. He was also a keen golfer.\nBuckland died at Winchester, Hampshire on 10 February 1906 aged just 41.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "E. W. Bastard", "response": ["The following season, Bastard returned to play for Oxford University, along with most of the successful team of the previous year. Despite the availability of almost the same squad, Oxford did not win a single match during 1885. Four of the university's bowlers, Edward Buckland, Herbert Page, Nicholls, and Whitby had an average in excess of 24 in 1885, having averaged below 21 the previous season.Bolton (1962), p. 119. The team came to rely upon the bowling of Bastard and Alfred Cochrane, both slow left-arm bowlers. Bastard began the season with a five-wicket haul in the first innings against the MCC, which he followed up with three more wickets in the second. He improved upon this performance in the next match, taking five wickets in each innings against Lancashire to complete his maiden ten-wicket haul in a first-class match, although the northern county won by 50 runs. He was less effective in later matches, claiming four wickets in an innings twice, but more often going wicketless. In the University match, Bastard's last, Oxford were bowled out on the first day for 136, and Cambridge opened a first innings lead of 151; Bastard claimed a solitary wicket from 38.3 overs. Oxford recovered in the second innings and scored 239, of which Bastard contributed 12 runs, leaving Cambridge requiring 89 runs to win, with over a day's play remaining. According to Bolton, Bastard \"bowled with great skill on the last morning\",Bolton (1962), p. 117. and claimed three Cambridge wickets, but was not supported by his fellow bowlers, and Cambridge achieved victory before lunch on the final day."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Edward Buckland (1887)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Edward Buckland (1885) : E.
