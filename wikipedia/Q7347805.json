He is a Senior Lecturer in Archaeology at the University of Exeter. His current research is focused on the external relations of Ancient Egypt, particularly the relations with Kush (Sudan). He also works on the historiography of Ancient Egypt.Morkot worked at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology before completing a PhD at University College London (1983\u20131987) on the relations of Egypt with Kush between 1500 and 700 BC. He was a Fellow at the Oriental Institute, Oxford from 1987 to 1991 and taught at The City University and the University of Surrey before he joined the University of Exeter in 1996.Morkot contributed to the 1991 book Centuries of Darkness, edited by Peter James. The book, questioning the conventional Egyptian chronology, caused a stir in the academic community and beyond; its thesis remains controversial.In addition to his academic work, Morkot has written a number of books on Egypt aimed at the general public, along with a book on Greek history, the Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Greece.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*Robert Morkot (born 1957) Egyptology"]}, {"page": "Shebitku", "response": ["The Turin Stela 1467, which depicts Shabaka and Shebitku seated together (with Shebitku behind Shabaka) facing two other individuals across an offering table, was once considered to be clear evidence for a royal co-regency between these two Nubian kings in William J.
