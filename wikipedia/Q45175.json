The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure. Smith rejoined Siouxsie and the Banshees as their lead guitarist in November 1982. He subsequently became a full-time member of the band, and was featured on the live video and album Nocturne.

The album was a Top 10 hit in the UK, and was their first studio album to break the Billboard 200 in the US, reaching number 180. Melody Maker praised the album as \"psychedelia that can't be dated\", while pondering, \"I've yet to meet anyone who can tell me why the Cure are having hits now of all times.\" The Cure then embarked on their worldwide Top Tour with Thompson, Anderson and producer-turned-bassist Phil Thornalley on board. Released in late 1984, the Cure's first live album, Concert consisted of performances from this tour. Near the tour's end, Anderson was fired for destroying a hotel room and was replaced by Boris Williams. Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring. However, the bassist slot was not vacant long, for a Cure roadie named Gary Biddles had brokered a reunion between Smith and former bassist Simon Gallup, who had been playing in the band Fools Dance. Soon after reconciling, Smith asked Gallup to rejoin the band.

In contrast to Tolhurst's recollection of their songwriting as a group effort until after 'Pornography', in 1982 Smith claimed to have written \"90 per cent of the 'Pornography' album\", and that he therefore couldn't leave The Cure, because it wouldn't be The Cure without him.Sutherland, Steve, \"The Incurables\", Melody Maker, 18 December 1982.", "For their first four albums (Three Imaginary Boys, Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography), all members of the group had received equal songwriting credits.

Three singles were released during 1982 and 1983 that were a significant divergence in style; essentially, pop hits. \"The Love Cats\" became the band's first single to infiltrate the top ten in the United Kingdom, peaking at number seven. This shift is attributed to Smith's frustration over the band's labelling as a predictable gothic rock band: \"My reaction to all those people\u00a0... was to make a demented and calculated song like 'Let's Go to Bed'.\" Following the return of guitarist Porl Thompson and bassist Simon Gallup and the addition of drummer Boris Williams in 1984, Smith and keyboardist Lol Tolhurst continued to integrate more pop-oriented themes with the release of the group's sixth studio album The Head on the Door (1985).
