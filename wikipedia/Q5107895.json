He joined Torquay United in March 2007, and went on to spend five years with the club, helping them to win the 2009 Conference play-off final. He was sold to Preston North End for an undisclosed fee in January 2012, but left the club at the end of the 2012\u201313 season after losing his first team place. He signed with Port Vale in June 2013. He returned to his native Scotland with Ross County in June 2015, before signing with AFC Wimbledon in September 2016. He joined Swindon Town in June 2017, and was released in May 2019 after being loaned out to Havant & Waterlooville earlier in the year.

On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision to take time off work to have hip replacement surgery.

He opened the 2013\u201314 season in a centre-back partnership with Chris Robertson, and said he \"enjoyed the challenge\" and that \"if I can make centre-half my shirt, happy days.\" He managed to start every game until picking up a suspension in mid-October.

Although there was a ready-made replacement in Chris Robertson (who had recently lost his place in the team to Mark Ellis), the possible length of Saah's absence prompted Martin Ling to bring in young Colchester United defender Tom Aldred as cover until January. However, Saah's injury was probably the only negative point to a game which saw Torquay achieve their first League win over Devon rivals Plymouth Argyle since 1972.  A stunning second half brace from Eunan O'Kane helped the Gulls record a 3\u20131 victory over a Pilgrims side who were languishing at the bottom of League Two having only just been relegated from League One the previous season.", "With the January transfer window open, Martin Ling had anticipated interest in his players, particularly with the side's current excellent form. When the inevitable enquiries came, it was defender Chris Robertson who had attracted the attention of other clubs. One of Torquay's longest serving players, Robertson's contract was due to expire in the summer and the Gulls took the option of accepting an undisclosed fee from League One side Preston North End for the player's services.", "With the squad now missing Chris Robertson and Billy Bodin, Martin Ling sought to bring in replacements for the departed pair.  First in was former Wales under-21 winger Nathan Craig.  Currently a free agent, Craig had impressed Ling while playing for the reserves and was offered what amounted to an extended trial until the end of the season. Another new face arrived in the shape of defender Angus MacDonald who was brought in on loan from Reading for the rest of the season. The new players had yet to make an appearance before Torquay's run of good form came to a shuddering halt with a surprise 2\u20131 defeat at Plainmoor to struggling Bradford City.  Fans may well have been wondering if they were feeling the delayed effects of the Manager of the Month 'curse' when the Gulls suffered a second successive loss away to Gillingham.  The 2\u20130 defeat at Priestfield ended in bizarre circumstances with the assistant referee flagging for a penalty when Brian Saah had seemingly brought down former Gulls-loanee Gavin Tomlin in the penalty box.  However, referee Jock Waugh (who had originally waved play-on) decided to send off Joe Oastler instead of Saah.  However, following an appeal, the FA rectified the error and the one-match ban was switched from Oastler to Saah.", "|= || DF ||  || 5 || Chris Robertson || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|5 ||  || DF || Chris Robertson || 2 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 0", "|Chris Robertson"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["|5||Chris Robertson||CB/RB||||Dundee||||17||1||\u2013||\u2013||31 January 2012||Torquay United||Undisclosed||30 June 2014", "|DF||||5||Chris Robertson||0||1||0||0||1", "|5||||DF||Chris Robertson||6||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||0"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Manager Micky Adams' first signing of the season was winger Kaid Mohamed, who stepped up to League One from League Two play-off semi-finalists Cheltenham Town; he was seen as a replacement for departing left-winger Ashley Vincent.

Following the trip, Anthony Griffith re-joined the club after securing his exit from League One rivals Leyton Orient. Mathias Kouo-Doumb\u00e9, Paul Reid and Ben Parker joined the club on trial, as Vale desperately needed more defensive cover. However the sixth signing of the summer was revealed as former Stoke City left-back Carl Dickinson, who secured his release form Watford in order to join the Vale. Chairman Norman Smurthwaite then told fans that there were to be no new signings as the club's wage bill was now up to 60 per cent of turnover \u2013 the maximum allowed under the Football League's new Financial Fair Play rule.", "April began with a 2\u20131 win over Crawley, the only negative in the game being a red card for Chris Robertson, who seemed baffled as to why he was dismissed. His ban was later overturned and handed to Chris Lines, who had committed the tackle from behind which started the brawl in which Robertson had attempted to intervene as peacemaker. Vale went on to beat Walsall 1\u20130 with a controversial penalty and in doing so recorded their first double over Walsall in 114 years. Captain Loft and Dan Jones were ruled out of the Vale's next fixture after a training ground confrontation between the pair left Loft with a facial injury. Following a short investigation Jones was sacked by the club. This upheaval seemed not to affect the team as they went 2\u20130 up over Notts County at Meadow Lane, but then four goals without reply from County all but ended Vale's faint hopes of a play-off push. Vale then recorded their fourth straight home win after Jordan Hugill scored the only goal of the game against Milton Keynes Dons. A trip to third-place Rotherham ended with a 1\u20130 defeat, despite the hosts going down to ten men. In their final home game of the season, Vale let slip a one-goal lead to lose 2\u20131 to Sheffield United. The season ended with a 0\u20130 draw with Peterborough United at London Road. Three players were released in the summer: Anthony Griffith, Liam Chilvers and Rob Taylor, whilst Chris Shuker announced his retirement due to a chronic knee injury. Micky Adams elected to sign a new contract with the club, as did most of the club's out-of-contract players.
