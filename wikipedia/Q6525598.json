He made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1908 season in a drawn match against Lancashire. In his first three years he scored moderately and was frequently caught out. He achieved his first century 104 not out against Leicestershire in the 1910 season. In the 1911 season his average almost doubled and he scored a century against Hampshire. In the following three years he maintained his form, scoring centuries against Warwickshire in the 1913 season and becoming the club's top scorer that year. He scored a century against Northamptonshire in the 1914 season. Cricket was then suspended during the First World War.\nIn the 1919 season he played to his pre-war standard and was top scorer for the county again. In the 1920 season he was acting captain for most of the matches in the absence of John Chapman but the team never won a game and finished at the bottom of the championship table.  This was despite Oliver's consistent performance with a top score of 170 against Nottinghamshire which led to his topping the batsmen's scores for the season again. In the 1921 season, Oliver made 151 against Warwickshire. His form then fell off and he played three matches in the 1922 season, two in the 1923 season and three in the 1924 season when he ceased playing in the Championship.\nOliver was a left-hand batsman and played 322 innings in 174 first-class matches. He scored 6 centuries with a top score 170 and an average 20.39. He was an expensive occasional right-arm medium pace bowler taking 5 wickets at an average of 65-6.Oliver died at Glossop at the age of 62.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Buckston", "response": ["Buckston returned to the Derbyshire team in the 1920 season.

His final first-class game was against Leicestershire when  Ernest Needham and Leonard Oliver both scored first-innings centuries for a Derbyshire victory.

The team was very unstable. Thirty eight players played for Derbyshire in the season, but only six played in more than half the matches. The club suffered from the absence of devastating bowler Billy Bestwick for all but one match, in which he took seven wickets, while other players such as Thomas Forrester and Arnold Warren were drawing to the end of their career.
