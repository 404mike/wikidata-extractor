The strongest pre-race favourite, Morocco's Said Aouita, led for over 200 metres.  After that, Kenya's John Ngugi moved into the lead.  However, until about 2,200 metres, he ran wide either on the second lane or on the first lane's outer edge.  After 900 metres, Ireland's John Treacy injected a more respectable speed into the sluggish early race.  Despite his noticeable acceleration, Treacy's 1,000-metre split was only 2:49.96.  After 1,600 metres, Ngugi again took the lead.  As he led the 15-man field through 2,000 metres in 5:34.93, the runners were tightly clustered behind him.  After 2,200 metres, the Kenyan suddenly surged.  Only Aouita and Ireland's Frank O'Mara followed Ngugi closely.  Before that lap was over, however, Ngugi slowed down again, and the field closed the gap on him.  Due to Ngugi's surge, the 3,000-metre split was 8:16.19.  The pace remained moderate during the fourth kilometre, with Ngugi leading at 4,000 metres in 10:58.60.  Then the field began to break up.  Britain's Steve Ovett, Ireland's Treacy, Canada's Carey Nelson, and Spain's Abel Anton started to lose contact with the main group.  Another pre-race favourite, Switzerland's Pierre Deleze, had accelerated to the third place behind Ngugi and Aouita at 4,000 metres.  Ovett was able to temporarily catch the leaders by 4,400 metres.  Sydney Maree of the United States had drifted to the rear of the main group.  By the second last home straight, also Ireland's O'Mara began to struggle with the increasing pace.  Shortly before 4,600 metres, Aouita eased past Ngugi, and the Moroccan's unofficial split at 4,600 metres was 12:33.52.  Portugal's Domingos Castro sprinted past Deleze into the second place on the final lap's front bend.  Britain's Jack Buckner, Belgium's Vincent Rousseau, Ngugi, Bulgaria's Evgeni Ignatov, Britain's Tim Hutchings, Portugal's Dionisio Castro, O'Mara, Maree, and Ovett were still in contention.  However, on the final back straight, Aouita further accelerated his pace, and only Domingos Castro and Deleze were able to follow him.  Buckner and Rousseau formed the first chasing group, with Ignatov, Hutchings, and Dionisio Castro fighting for the sixth place.  Ngugi drifted to the leading group's rear, and Ovett and Maree were about to pass him.  By 4,800 metres, Aouita's victory already started to look certain, but Domingos Castro tenaciously remained ahead of Deleze.  On the final home straight, Aouita's superior middle-distance runner's speed took him to an easy and clear victory.  Domingos Castro was able to secure the silver medal, while Deleze faded badly during the last 20 metres, losing the bronze medal to the quickly finishing Buckner.  Unofficially, Aouita sprinted the final 400 metres in 52.92 seconds.

The Italians, Britons and Portuguese tried some team tactics during the race.  Italy's Salvatore Antibo led until about 500 metres, after which his famous teammate Alberto Cova took over.  Both were clearly trying to help their teammate Stefano Mei, who had surprisingly defeated the defending champion Cova on the opening day, in the 10,000-metre race.  Shortly after Cova had passed 1,000 metres in the lead in 2:39.04, Portugal's Fernando Couto accelerated to the front, to help his well-known teammate Ant\u00f3nio Leit\u00e3o, the defending Olympic bronze medalist at this distance.  Couto was still leading at 2,000 metres in 5:19.72.  Shortly thereafter, Cova passed Couto, who quickly drifted to the rear of the field, to join West Germany's Uwe M\u00f6nkemeyer, Czechoslovakia's Ivan Uvizl and Britain's Steve Ovett, who had apparently lost his best shape for the 1986 season.  After his stunningly easy victory at the Commonwealth Games 5,000-metre race, Ovett had been considered a favourite also for the European Championships final.  However, he had struggled to qualify for this final, and already during the first lap, he had drifted to the last place.  After 2,300 metres, Leit\u00e3o re-took the lead from Cova.  Before 3,000 metres (which Leit\u00e3o passed in 7:58.97), Ovett, Uvizl, Couto, M\u00f6nkemeyer and Antibo had dropped from the lead group.  Exhausted, Ovett dropped out of the final altogether at 3,000 metres.  The pace temporarily slowed down, with a couple of laps over 65 seconds.  After 3,600 metres, Britain's Tim Hutchings went into the lead, and began to gradually improve the pace.  His remaining teammate Jack Buckner followed well in contention. Surprisingly, the defending Olympic silver medalist at this distance, Switzerland's Markus Ryffel dropped out before 3,900 metres, while still in the lead group.  After 3,900 metres, Belgium's Vincent Rousseau lost contact with the lead group.  So tired out was the Belgian that he jogged the last 1,000 metres in over 3 minutes.  Shortly after Hutchings had covered 4,000 metres in the lead, with a time of 10:42.20, Finland's Martti Vainio and Switzerland's Pierre D\u00e9l\u00e8ze dropped from the lead group.  Before 4,300 metres, Cova also tired out, to the surprise of many spectators.  Although Leit\u00e3o passed Cova, he was unable to keep up with Hutchings, Buckner, Mei, and Bulgaria's Evgeni Ignatov.  Buckner took the lead at 4,600 metres, with a split time of about 12:14.  About 100 metres later, Ignatov dropped from the top group.  Before 4,800 metres, Mei managed to pass Buckner.  In the first half of the final bend, Hutchings dropped from Mei's pace, but in the second half of the bend, Buckner kicked past Mei.  He widened his lead to almost 1.5 seconds, to win in a new European Championships record time of 13:10.15.  ", "Unofficially, he ran the last lap in 56.14 seconds.
