He can also be quite resourceful \u2013 he appears to support himself by selling handmade wooden buggies and pilfering food from sympathetic local shops, or convoluted schemes to create  sudden crowds in order to celebrate his birthday on 25 October (which also happened to be Maurice Dodd's Birthday). Wellington can also be something of a worrier, always concerned that the world is going to rack an' rooney (rack and ruin). Over the years he has worried that the world is becoming clogged up with dirt, that people might get crushed by the weight of air above their heads, and that each new year might be the same old year recycled to save money. Actually there might be something in that; Wellington (unlike any other comic character) has actually noticed that he and his friends never seem to get any older. On those rare occasions when he cheers up, a small raincloud usually appears to dampen his spirits.", "Boot was originally drawn with a short tail (on one occasion he met a bob-tailed sheepdog, and on hearing the name decided to call his own tail Fred), but Maurice Dodd later discovered that real Old English Sheepdogs' tails are docked, and so over the course of several years Collins drew his tail shorter and shorter until it vanished altogether \u2013 Boot still appears completely white, rare for the breed.", "Around 1980 an LP record album entitled THE PERISHERS SING! (WELL SORT OF) was issued by Response Records. The lyrics written by Maurice Dodd and the music by Trevor Evan Jones. An instrumental version of the final track \"It's Great to be a Kid\" was also the theme music for the animated TV version. Dodd's official website claims 12 songs were penned, but the finished album only contained 10 tracks. It featured narration by Bernard Cribbins, and also credits Nicky James and Barbara Sexton with vocals."]}, {"page": "2005 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 31 December \u2013 Maurice Dodd, cartoonist (born 1932)"]}, {"page": "2005 in comics", "response": ["** Maurice Dodd, British comics writer and artist (continued The Perishers), dies at age 83."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2005", "response": ["*Maurice Dodd, 83, British cartoonist (The Perishers), brain haemorrhage."]}, {"page": "1932 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 25 October \u2013 Maurice Dodd, cartoonist (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "Dodd (surname)", "response": ["*Maurice Dodd (1922\u20132005), English cartoonist"]}, {"page": "List of newspaper comic strips P\u2013Z", "response": ["* The Perishers (1958\u20132006) originally by Dennis Collins and Maurice Dodd (UK)"]}, {"page": "List of fictional dogs in comics", "response": ["| Maurice Dodd"]}, {"page": "1979 in animation", "response": ["* March 21: The first episode of The Perishers is broadcast, based on Maurice Dodd's comic strip The Perishers."]}, {"page": "The Perishers (TV series)", "response": ["The Perishers is a cartoon series produced by Bill Melendez Productions and FilmFair.
