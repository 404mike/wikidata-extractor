On the death of a Princess Royal the style is not inherited by any of her daughters; instead, if the late Princess Royal's parent the monarch has also died, the new monarch may bestow it upon his or her own eldest daughter. Thus, Princess Louise was granted the style of Princess Royal by her father, King Edward VII in 1905; she retained it until her death in 1931, over twenty years into the reign of her brother King George V. Only upon Louise's death did the title become available for George's own daughter, Princess Mary, who was granted the title in 1932, retaining it until her death in 1965. Because Mary outlived not only her father but also her brother King George VI, the title was never available in George VI's reign to be granted his eldest daughter Princess Elizabeth (the present Queen Elizabeth II), though she would have been eligible to hold it. Following Princess Anne's death, the next potentially eligible royal princess would be Princess Charlotte of Cambridge who could receive the title when her father, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, becomes king. As of 2021, he is second in line to the throne."]}, {"page": "Mountbatten-Windsor", "response": ["****(4)  Princess Charlotte of Cambridge (b. 2015)"]}, {"page": "Order of precedence in England and Wales", "response": ["|  Princess Charlotte of Cambridge (only daughter of the Duke of Cambridge)"]}, {"page": "Order of precedence in Scotland", "response": ["#Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, only daughter of the Earl of Strathearn"]}, {"page": "Order of precedence in Northern Ireland", "response": ["#Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, only daughter of the Duke of Cambridge"]}]}}
