Its full title is Like water, like fire: an anthology of Byelorussian poetry from 1828 to the present day. It was published in London in the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works series in 1971. The translator of all works was a London-based journalist, poet and translator Vera Rich. The book was jointly funded by UNESCO and the National Commission for UNESCO of the Byelorussian SSR.", "In 2012, Svetlana Skomorokhova produced a detailed analysis of the anthology as part of her doctoral thesis on the English translation of Belarusian literature. She noted that 'the founding fathers' of the new Belarusian literature - Bahdanovich, Kolas and Kupala - were the most translated poets of the anthology; and the well-established poets of the 20th century were well represented too, which \"makes the book a seminal work in Belarusian literary translations into English\". Its \"scope and diachronic method make it as yet unrivalled\", while \"the coverage and the encyclopaedic character of the data presented in the book are extensive\". Skomorokhova noted that for translating and explaining Belarusian poetry, Vera Rich used masterfully her knowledge of classical English literature, and employed comparisons with English, Irish and Welsh literary traditions extensively. Skomorokhova doubted, however, that Rich's style would appeal to a modern reader; she suggested that Rich's translations \"may be in line for further revisions as well due to her disregard of contemporary literary aesthetics in her translations\".", "The one page and half of the Acknowledgements section reads like a piece of smart comedy. It begins with acknowledging 13 libraries and research institutions which assisted Vera Rich with \"help and advice\": mostly libraries in Britain (incl. the Belarusian Library in London), as well as in Norway and Denmark. Then she thanks \"the Royal Horticultural Gardens, Kew for checking so many details of the flora of Byelorussia, H.M. War Office, for advice on the management and control of tanks, and British Rail [...], for details of the logistics of rolling stock\". Among the named individuals there was Olwen Way, \"who supplied some Welsh parallels, and also advised on certain matters connected with horse-riding\", and Patricia Waller, \"for her technical knowledge and advice concerning the curing of pork both now and in the past\".", "According to Janka Zaprudnik, after the book went on sale the National Commission for UNESCO of the Byelorussian SSR demanded the whole stock to be destroyed, however the UNESCO refused as this would have constituted a breach of the contract with the publisher. The Belarusian party particularly strongly objected to the dustjacket carrying the Pahonia. Eventually, the UNESCO agreed to pay for replacing the dustjacket for the one with the oak leaf. Other Belarusian demands: removal of the note mentioning the joint publication of the book, removal of the Copyright notice and adding a disclaimer of Vera Rich's full responsibility for the introduction and commentaries \u2014 were not met."]}, {"page": "Alan Flowers", "response": ["Flowers was \u201cintroduced to Belarus, Belarusians in Britain and the Anglo-Belarusian Society by Vera Rich, in 1992, in connection with his academic interests in Chernobyl."]}, {"page": "Mahutny Bo\u017ea (Almighty God)", "response": ["\"Mahutny Bo\u017ea\" (, translated as \u00a0\u201cAlmighty God\u201d) is a famous Belarusian hymn, based on a poem by Natallia Arsiennieva and music by Mikola Ravienski.
