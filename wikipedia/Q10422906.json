Cup semifinal at Stamford Bridge on 26 March 1927, which Southampton lost 1\u20132 to Arsenal. During this season manager Arthur Chadwick soon settled on his favoured line-up with eleven players featuring in at least 35 of the 42 league games; Keeping lined up in defence with Ted Hough behind the three centre-backs \u2013 Bert Shelley, George Harkus and Stan Woodhouse."]}, {"page": "Cyril King (footballer)", "response": ["His first appearance for the Division Two side was away to Newcastle United on 1 December 1934 as a replacement for Stan Woodhouse.

In October, Saints appointed Arthur Chadwick as manager, who re-instated Harkus in the team at the expense of Campbell in November; he retained the left-back place for the rest of the season.

Described by Holley & Chalk as \"a man of dynamic personality\" and \"tremendously energetic and enthusiastic, he was a natural captain who put so much into a game that, when the 90 minutes were up, he was often all in.\" Harkus featured strongly in Saints' run to their second FA Cup semi-final in two years, this time losing 2\u20131 to Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on 26 March 1927."]}, {"page": "Sam Taylor (English footballer)", "response": ["Taylor spent the 1925\u201326 season in the Midland League with Mansfield Town before returning to the Second Division with Southampton in June 1926.

He made his debut at inside-right in the opening game of the season, a local derby at Portsmouth, when he scored in a 3\u20131 defeat. He retained his place for a further five games without scoring and was replaced by Alf Bishop before being recalled, this time at inside-left on 9 October. Taylor then scored in three consecutive matches and retained his place for the rest of the season. Described as \"a thoughtful and intelligent inside-forward\", Taylor developed a good relationship on the left-wing with Billy \"Spud\" Murphy and Stan Woodhouse with \"simple, planned moves\" allowing Taylor a free run at goal.

The New Year saw a slump in the team's performances and by the end of the season they had fallen back to 13th place in the table. They did, however, have a good run in the FA Cup, reaching the semi-finals where they went out to Arsenal, with Murphy appearing in all the cup matches.

For the 1925\u201326 season, Saints appointed Arthur Chadwick as manager, but his arrival made only a moderate impact on the team's fortunes, finishing 14th in the table.

In 1933\u201334, he was again kept out of his favoured role as full back, this time by Arthur Roberts, but had a run of four games taking over from Tommy Brewis at inside right, during which he scored twice in a 5\u20130 victory over Bradford at The Dell on 16 December."]}, {"page": "Bill Luckett", "response": ["In the next season, Luckett's first-team chances were restricted by the form of Stan Woodhouse at left-half, and his five appearances came in four different positions  as the \"Saints\" had their best season since joining the Second Division in 1922, finishing fourth in the table.

In the FA Cup, Southampton had an excellent run reaching the semi-final against Arsenal. The semi-final was played at Stamford Bridge on 26 March 1927; after the Saints had an early penalty appeal turned down by the referee, Arsenal mounted a prolonged pressure on the Southampton goal, resulting in the opening score, when a cross-shot from Joe Hulme was deflected by Hough past Tommy Allen into the Saints' goal.

With Turner ever-present in 1924\u201325, Ward spent the entire season in the reserves, but injury to Turner allowed Ward to return in the 1925\u201326 season, making ten appearances.
