This was despite an investor revolt in which a third of shareholders opposed the payout, citing the fact that company had suffered its second consecutive annual loss, caused by a \u00a3385m charge for mis-sold payment protection insurance. Duffy's increase was largely due to a bonus of \u00a31.3m linked to the 2015 demerger of Virgin Money's predecessor bank, CYBG, from National Australia Bank, as well as incentives from 2016."]}, {"page": "Jim Pettigrew", "response": ["On 7 May 2018 it was reported that CYBG plc, under the leadership of David Duffy and the Board, had made an all share offer to acquire Virgin Money UK.
