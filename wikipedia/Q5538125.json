The movement gained influential support, but it was also attacked by some bishops of the Church and by the latitudinarians within the University of Oxford, who believed in conforming to official Church of England practices but who felt that matters of doctrine, liturgical practice, and ecclesiastical organization were of relatively little importance. Within the Oxford movement, there gradually arose a much smaller group which tended towards submission to the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1845, the university censured a tract entitled Ideal of a Christian Church and its author, the pro-Roman Catholic theologian W. G. Ward, on which basis was imputed the moniker \"Ideal Ward\". The year 1850 saw the victory of the Evangelical cleric George Cornelius Gorham in a celebrated legal action against church authorities. Consequently, some Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship were received into the Roman Catholic Church, while others, such as Mark Pattison, embraced Latitudinarian Anglicanism, and yet others, such as James Anthony Froude, became sceptics. The majority of adherents of the movement, however, remained in the Church of England and, despite hostility in the press and in government, the movement spread. Its liturgical practices were influential, as were its social achievements (including its slum settlements) and its revival of male and female monasticism within Anglicanism."]}, {"page": "Henry Phillpotts", "response": ["On the one hand, the famous Gorham judgment was the outcome of his refusal to give the living of Brampford Speke to George Cornelius Gorham (1787\u20131857), who had expressed disbelief in baptismal regeneration; on the other hand, he denounced the equally famous Tract 90 in his episcopal charge of 1843."]}, {"page": "Oxford Movement", "response": ["*George Cornelius Gorham"]}, {"page": "Gorham", "response": ["*George Cornelius Gorham (1787\u20131857), English cleric"]}, {"page": "George Gorham", "response": ["*George Cornelius Gorham (1787\u20131857), controversial English ecclesiastic"]}, {"page": "Thomas Martyn", "response": ["Two of Martyn's major works are Plant\u00e6 Cantabrigiensis (1763) and Flora Rustica, 4 vols.
