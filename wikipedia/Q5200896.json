In ten months with the club, he scored 8 goals from 23 appearances before being swapped for Brighton & Hove Albion's centre forward Cyril Thompson. He scored 17 goals in 20 months for Brighton, at better than a goal every two games, but never established himself as a regular in the side, and moved on to Workington in November 1952. He fell out with the club over money, and left at the end of the season having played only eight times; Workington retained his registration for several years."]}]}}
