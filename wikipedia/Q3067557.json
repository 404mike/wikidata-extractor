She has competed in four major international championships. The first was in 2006 when she came 17th at the European Championships and the second was three years later when she finished 14th at the World Championships. During 2009 she was ranked 2nd best in the country and 9th best of all time. In the 2010 Commonwealth Games she won the gold medal for the England team, with a personal best of 6156 points. At the 2011 Mehrkampf-Meeting Ratingen she scored 6166 points but this included wind-assisted performances and she also competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics. In July 2012 she appeared with Tasha Danvers, Mark Foster, Derek Redmond on the Channel Four programme Come Dine With Me prior to her Olympics competition, and won the show.In September 2013 she announced her retirement from heptathlon, although she could compete in other events. In January 2014 she announced that she would come out of retirement to defend her title at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow after Jessica Ennis-Hill announced that she would miss the Games due to pregnancy. However, in June 2014 Hazel stated that she had decided to abandon her comeback due to her training schedule being disrupted by a flare-up of ulcerative colitis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March, Cambridgeshire", "response": ["* Louise Hazel (born 1985), heptathlete"]}, {"page": "Birchfield Harriers", "response": ["* Louise Hazel"]}, {"page": "Sport in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Over the last few decades British athletes have usually won between one and three gold medals at the Olympics; the 2012 Games in London saw three British athletes win four golds (single golds by Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford, and two by Mo Farah), while a further two golds were won in 2016 (both by Farah, who with four Olympic and six World titles is Great Britain's most successful track athlete). Traditionally Britain was strongest in men's athletics, especially middle-distance running in which Roger Bannister, Steve Ovett, Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram were global stars, but over the last 20 years success has been achieved in a wide range of events and British women have closed the attainment gap on the men, seeing particular success in heptathlon with major titles for Denise Lewis, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Louise Hazel and Kelly Sotherton. However, there remain serious concerns about the depth of the sport in Britain, with the number of club athletes reportedly in decline. In contrast, recreational athletics, especially running has enjoyed a boom under the Parkrun scheme."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2006 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|17||Louise Hazel||Heptathlon||5894||PB", "Heptathlon: Jessica Ennis, Kelly Sotherton, Louise Hazel"]}, {"page": "List of Mizuno sponsorships", "response": ["* Louise Hazel"]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|Jessica EnnisLouise Hazel", "|Louise Hazel"]}, {"page": "2009 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's heptathlon", "response": ["| 7  || 3 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 13.60 ||  1036 || SB", "| 18  || A ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  ||1.71 ||867 ||PB ", "| 25 || A ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  ||11.62 ||636 ||", "|  || 3 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  ||24.19 ||963 ||SB ", "| 14 || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  ||6.13 ||890 ||", "| 12 || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  ||43.51 ||735 ||", "| 16 || 3 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  ||2:15.85 ||881 ||PB ", "|align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  "]}, {"page": "Neale-Wade Academy", "response": ["*Louise Hazel, heptathlete"]}, {"page": "2006 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Women's heptathlon", "response": ["|   || 1 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 13.44 || 1059 || PB", "| 24  || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 1.71 || 867 || PB", "| 28  || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 11.62 || 636 ||", "|   || 4 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 24.12 || 969 || PB", "| 16  || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 6.05 || 865 ||", "| 22  || A ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 38.60 || 640 ||", "| 16  || 1 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 2:17.45 || 858 || PB", "| 17 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 5894 || PB"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Louise Hazel"]}, {"page": "October 2010 in sports", "response": ["****Heptathlon:  Louise Hazel  6156 points  Jessica Zelinka  6100  Grace Clements  5819"]}, {"page": "List of A League of Their Own episodes", "response": ["|Louise Hazel"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's heptathlon", "response": ["| 16 || 3 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 13.48 || 1053 || SB", "| 38 || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || o || o || xxx ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  1.59 || 724 || || 1777 || 37", "| 29 || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 11.69 || 12.41 || 12.81 || 12.81 || 715 || || 2492 || 37", "| 20 || 2 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 24.48 || 935 || SB || 3427 || 34", "| 29 || A ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 5.45 || 5.56 || 5.77 || 5.77 || 780 || SB || 4207 || 31", "| 11 || A ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 39.90 || 42.17 || 47.38 || 47.38 || 809 || PB || 5016 || 30", "| 23 || 1 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 2:18.78 || 840 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification", "response": ["|Jessica EnnisLouise HazelKatarina Johnson-Thompson"]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["!style=\"border-right:double\" rowspan=\"2\"|Louise Hazel"]}, {"page": "2011 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's heptathlon", "response": ["| 5 || 1 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left| || 13.24 || 1089 ||  PB", "| 20 || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || o || o || o || o || xo || xxo || xxx || || || || || || 1.74 || 903 || PB || 1992", "| 22 || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 12.28 || X || 12.36 || 12.36 || 685 || SB || 2677", "| 7 || 2 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left| || 24.25 || 957 || || 3634", "| 10 || A ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 6.15 || 6.25 || 6.12 || 6.25 || 927 || || 4561", "| 17 || B ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left|  || 40.53 || 41.75 || 39.37 || 41.75  || 701 || || 5262", "| 16|| 2 ||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left| || 2:15.44 || 887 ||", "| 15||align=left| Louise Hazel ||align=left| || 6149 ||"]}, {"page": "Text Santa", "response": ["*A celebrity edition of Ninja Warrior UK aired during the telethon on 18 December.
