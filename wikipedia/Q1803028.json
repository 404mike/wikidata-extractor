It is even said that the Liberal leader in that chamber\u2014Sir Collier Cudmore\u2014once referred to Playford as a 'Bolshevik'.Howell, p. 66. The unique economic intervention earned Playford scorn from his own colleagues, but the Labor movement was much more receptive. Indeed, Labor leader Mick O'Halloran would dine with Playford on a weekly basis to discuss the development of the state, and the pair were on close personal terms. At a dinner party, O'Halloran remarked that \"I wouldn't want to be Premier even if I could be. Tom Playford can often do more for my own voters than I could if I were in his shoes.\"Cockburn, p. 218. O'Halloran's lack of ambition was mocked in a political cartoon, but the Labor leader took the piece as a compliment and had it framed and put on display.Howell, p. 67. As Playford had more opposition from his LCL colleagues in the upper house than Labor, O'Halloran was often described as the premier's 'junior partner\".Blewett and Jaensch, p. 14. Playford called Labor \"our Opposition\", in comparison to opponents in his party, which he decried as being \"critical without being helpful\". This cooperative nature of party politics would not change until Don Dunstan's prominence in the late 1950s,Howell, pp. 65\u201368. when Playford would be assailed not for his economics, but for his government's comparatively low expenditure on public services such as education and healthcare.Hugo, pp. 41, 45."]}, {"page": "List of University of Adelaide people", "response": ["* Collier Cudmore \u2013 Olympic rower and gold medal winner"]}, {"page": "James Angus Gillan", "response": ["The Magdalen crew was chosen to represent Great Britain rowing at the 1908 Summer Olympics, and Gillan was in the four with Collier Cudmore, John Somers-Smith and Duncan Mackinnon.
