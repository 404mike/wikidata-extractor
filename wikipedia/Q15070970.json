It was stored in a sheriff's compter. The rebels also attacked the Guildhall and other civic buildings first and at least the former he attempted to burn down. Since the book was subsequently burned by a later Mayor of London, Nicholas Exton, little is known of its contents of the book.  Historians have been unable to ascertain Keye's motive for his \"frenzied\" search for it. Keye also appears to have personally led a small armed force to the Milk Street sheriff's compter, which they assaulted and despoiled. Keye also took advantage of the general turmoil of the time to extort money from fellow brewers. He and his associates have been described by Barrie Dobson as showing that there was at least one rebel group \"prepared to challenge the authority of the civic hierarchy as well as that of royal officials and agents.\""]}, {"page": "Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!", "response": ["The historian Barrie Dobson has noted the popularity of burning charters, \"records and writings in the house of justice\" and other legal records during the Peasants' Revolt.

The university was particularly unpopular in Cambridge as, on the one hand, it took a heavy-handed role in the town's policing, but on the other, its scholars received benefit of clergy which effectively exempted them from lay courts."]}]}}
