Mealing joined No. 56 Squadron on 18 October as a SE.5a pilot. He opened his victory roll on 30 November, destroying an Albatros D.III over Lesdain. On 10 December, he became a balloon buster when he destroyed an observation balloon. He began 1918 with a victory on 25 January, and another on 17 February. Then, in March, while Mealing was on the brink of acedom, the German build up toward their last offensive supplied him with numerous opportunities. Between 8 and 24 March, he accumulated ten more wins, including another balloon busted, a reconnaissance aircraft shared with Captain William Spurrett Fielding-Johnson and another two-seater downed while teamed with Second Lieutenant Harold Walkerdine, Lieutenant Henry John Burden, and three other British pilots. On 24 March, he was seen pursuing a pair of German two-seaters; another report had him standing waving next to his grounded aircraft. He was never seen again. His Military Cross was awarded to him on 13 May 1918."]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Harold Walkerdine"]}]}}
