He was an innovative boat designer who pioneered the development of the racing shell and the use of outriggers. He is said to have invented spoon-shaped oars.He was the first of three well-known Tyneside oarsmen, the other two being Robert Chambers and James Renforth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tyneside", "response": ["Rivalry between the Tyne and the Thames was very keen, and rowers who upheld the honour of the Tyne became local heroes. Three such oarsmen, who came from humble backgrounds and became household names in the North East, were Harry Clasper, Robert Chambers and James Renforth. Clasper was a champion rower in fours, as well as an innovative boat designer and a successful rowing coach. Chambers and Renforth were oarsmen who excelled at sculling. Both held the World Sculling Championship at different times."]}, {"page": "Outrigger", "response": ["In a rowing boat or galley, an outrigger (or rigger) is a triangular frame that holds the rowlock (into which the oar is slotted) away from the saxboard (or gunwale in gig rowing) to optimize leverage. Wooden outriggers appear on the new trireme around the 7th or 6th centuries BC and later on Italian galleys around AD 1300, while Harry Clasper (1812\u20131870), a British professional rower, popularised the use of the modern tubular-metal version and the top rowing events accepted the physiological and ergonomic advantages so acceded to its use in competitions.  In recent decades, some manufacturers of racing shells have proposed wing-riggers which are reinforced arcs or flattened tubular projections akin to aircraft wings, instead of conventional triangular structures."]}, {"page": "Dunston, Tyne and Wear", "response": ["Footballers Paul GascoigneEnglish-Football.org.uk: Paul Gascoigne  and Ray Hudson,Ray Hudson and the lead singer of AC/DC Brian Johnson all spent their formative years in Dunston.

However his performances improved until he was drawn against the veteran oarsman Harry Clasper in the second heat of the Tyne sculling championship, in 1855. Clasper, who at that time was 43, won the race, but he recognised that Chambers had great potential. He therefore invited him to join his Derwenthaugh crew. The new crew consisted of Harry Clasper (at stroke), his brother Robert, his eldest son John Hawks and Robert Chambers. The crew took part in the Durham Regatta of 1856 and won the main prize, the Patron's Plate. Chambers took part in the sculling competition and lost in the final to teammate John Hawkes Clasper."]}, {"page": "James Renforth", "response": [" James Renforth  (7 April 1842 \u2013 23 August 1871) was an English Tyneside professional oarsman.

Sadler rowed steadily, overtook his opposition, and went on to win very comfortably in a time of 28m.05s. Sadler announced he would not return to training. This suggested that the race would have been Sadler's last. However, his actual final Championship race came on 27 June 1876, when he lost to Edward Trickett in 24m.35s. After an even start Trickett took a three lengths lead, which Sadler was unable to recover. This was the first Championship race rowed on sliding seats.(see Harry Clasper (section Sliding seats)). The race became known as the World Championship at this point as Trickett was the first non-British contestant to win. Sadler was reported to have retired after this race but he must have continued some later training. On 5 November 1877 he and Harry Kelley, his old foe, raced over the Putney to Mortlake course for a stake of \u00a3400. After an even start Sadler went ahead and was never passed. His time was 24m.02s.
