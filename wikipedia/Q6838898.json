As per the real life Micky Burn, he served as a journalist in Berlin before the war and has an intimate knowledge of Germany and German politics, admits to having had some admiration for National Socialism. Carrington appears to be sensible at first, but he is a maverick, which gets him in trouble with the Germans and the British alike. Carrington becomes involved in an escape attempt with Pat Grant, the character based on real life escapee Pat Reid. In reality the officer who escaped with Reid via Hans Larive's Singen route was Canadian Howard Wardle. In later episodes, Carrington is shown to have switched his commission to the US Army Air Corps, and, in that role, is recaptured and sent to Colditz along with the three characters listed below."]}, {"page": "Michael Byrne", "response": ["* Micky Burn (1912\u20132010), English journalist"]}, {"page": "Oflag IV-C", "response": ["Micky Burn, another well-known inmate of Colditz, was a British commando captured at Saint-Nazaire.
