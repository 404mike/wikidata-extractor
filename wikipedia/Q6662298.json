He took 64 wickets and scored 941 runs. He turned to umpiring after his playing days and stood in 4 home Test matches and 12 home One Day Internationals. The first Test he umpired was the controversial Test at Old Trafford in 1976 when England's batsmen John Edrich and Brian Close were subject to a bouncer barrage from the West Indian quick bowlers. His last Test was at Lord's in 1978 featuring the touring Pakistan team. He died in 1986 in Southampton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Lloyd Budd||||4||1976||1978"]}, {"page": "1975 Cricket World Cup Officials", "response": ["The first semifinal was supervised by Bill Alley and David Constant while Lloyd Budd and Arthur Fagg supervised the second semifinal.Bill Alley and DJ Constant in the 1st semifinal of 1975 Cricket World Cup ESPN cricinfoLloyd Budd and Arthur Fagg in the 2nd semifinal of 1975 Cricket World Cup ESPN cricinfo", "| |Lloyd Budd"]}, {"page": "1979 Cricket World Cup Officials", "response": ["The first semifinal was supervised by John Langridge and Ken Palmer while Lloyd Budd and David Constant supervised the second semifinal.John Langridge and Ken Palmer in the 1st semifinal of 1979 Cricket World Cup ESPN cricinfoLloyd Budd and David Constant in the 2nd semifinal of 1979 Cricket World Cup ESPN cricinfo", "| |Lloyd Budd"]}]}}
