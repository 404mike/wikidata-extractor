The Governors elected to give James Lewis the task. Incorporating the best elements from the three winning competition designs, he produced a building in the neoclassical style that, while drawing heavily on Hooke's original plan, eschewed the ornament of its predecessor. Completed after three years in 1815, it was constructed during the first wave of county asylum building in England under the County Asylum Act (\"Wynn's Act\") of 1808.;  Extending to  in length, the new hospital, which ran alongside the Lambeth Road, consisted of a central block with two wings of three storeys on either side. Female patients occupied the west wing and males the east; as at Moorfields, the cells were located off galleries that traversed each wing. Each gallery contained only one toilet, a sink and cold baths. Incontinent patients were kept on beds of straw in cells in the basement gallery; this space also contained rooms with fireplaces for attendants.

The Latinized term dementia praecox entered psychiatry in 1886 in a textbook by asylum physician Heinrich Sch\u00fcle (1840-1916) of the Illenau asylum in Baden. He used the term to refer to hereditarily predisposed individuals who were \"wrecked on the cliffs of puberty\" and developed acute dementia, while others developed the chronic condition of hebephrenia. Emil Kraepelin had cited Sch\u00fcle's 1886 textbook in the 1887 second edition of his own textbook, Psychiatrie, and hence was familiar with this term at least six years before he himself adopted it.   It later appeared in 1891 in a case report by Arnold Pick which argued that hebephrenia should be regarded as a form of dementia praecox. Kraepelin first used the term in 1893. In 1899 Emil Kraepelin introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was caused by a lifelong, smoldering systemic or \"whole body\" process of a metabolic nature that would eventually affect the functioning of the brain in a final decisive cascade. Hence, he believed the entire body\u2014all the organs, glands and peripheral nervous system\u2014was implicated in the natural disease process. Although he used the term \"dementia,\" Kraepelin seemed to use the term synonymously with \"mental weakness,\" mental defect,\" and \"mental deterioration,\" but distinguished it from other uses of the term dementia, such as in Alzheimer's disease, which typically occur later in life. In 1853 B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel used the term d\u00e9mence pr\u00e9coce (precocious or early dementia) to describe a group of young patients who were suffering from \"stupor\". It is sometimes argued that this first use of the term signals the medical discovery of schizophrenia. However, Morel employed the phrase in a purely descriptive sense and he did not intend to delineate a new diagnostic category. Moreover, his traditional conception of dementia differed significantly from that employed in the latter half of the nineteenth-century. Finally, there is no evidence that Morel's d\u00e9mence pr\u00e9coce had any influence on the later development of the dementia praecox concept by either Arnold Pick or Emil Kraepelin."]}, {"page": "Air Loom", "response": ["#redirect James Tilly Matthews#The_.22Air_Loom.22"]}, {"page": "John Haslam (physician)", "response": ["John Haslam (1764\u20131844) was an English apothecary, physician and medical writer, known for his work on mental illness.

In an 1809 edition of a work on insanity he included a detailed description of the case of James Tilly Matthews which is one of the earliest and clearest recordings of paranoid schizophrenia. However, in the early years of the nineteenth century, Bethlehem Hospital came to be compared unfavourably with the reformed asylums, notably with The Retreat in York, and with St Luke's under William Battie and his successors. This shift of fashionable opinion reached a decisive conclusion with the Norris scandal of 1815/1816, and Haslam (and, to a lesser extent, Thomas Monro) attracted much of the popular and political obloquy, voiced especially by Edward Wakefield, a Quaker land agent and leading advocate of asylum reform.
