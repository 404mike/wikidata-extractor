He was married to Sarah Fatima, his distant relative, on 21 July 2010 . He studied at the Dr B R Ambedkar Medical College, an affiliated college of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences between 1998 and 2003 and completed his internship in 2003-2004, moving to the UK in November 2004 to pursue higher studies.He is the brother of Kafeel Ahmed, who was also arrested in the aftermath of the attack, and has been variously reported as the second cousin, uncle or brother of Mohammed Haneef, with whom he studied medicine in Bangalore, and who was arrested at the Brisbane Airport on 2 July 2007. Mohamed Haneef is a second cousin of Sabeel as their grandparents are brother and sister.Ahmed was alleged to have been given Haneef's British mobile phone SIM card when the latter left the UK for a job at the Gold Coast Hospital in Queensland, Australia.; He is reported to have applied for medical positions in Western Australia in 2005, but was rejected after officials because of concerns over their qualifications and references.On 14 July 2007, British police charged Ahmed with failing to disclose information that could have prevented an act of terrorism. In April 2008 he was given an 18-month prison sentence for withholding information.Ahmed was deported back to India on 8 May 2008 after being released due to time already served. He moved to Saudi Arabia in 2010 to work at a hospital. In 2015, he was charged by the National Investigation Agency in a case of an alleged militant recruitment by Lashkar-e-Taiba carried out in 2012. In 2017, the Delhi Police accused him of trying to recruit Indians for Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent. He was deported back to India and arrested by the NIA on 28 August 2020.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 2007 UK terrorist incidents", "response": ["#Dr. Sabeel Ahmed, 26, born in India and brother of Kafeel (above), a doctor at Halton Hospital in Cheshire.

He is the second cousin once removed of Kafeel Ahmed and Sabeel Ahmed, the operatives in the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack. Haneef's ensuing detention became the longest without charge in recent Australian history, which caused great controversy in Australia and India.", "Australian authorities alleged that as Haneef left Britain he recklessly provided assistance to a terrorist organisation by leaving his relative, Sabeel Ahmed, a SIM card and the balance of a two-year mobile phone contract to use and pay off when he left Britain in July 2006. Relatives have said that he left the SIM card behind to save money by not surrendering the remaining value of the contract to the telephone company. The prosecutor claimed the SIM card was found inside the vehicle used in the Glasgow attack. This allegation, central to the case, proved to be false and investigating British police officers concluded that the case was driven by politics rather than policing.", "The AFP claimed in a court affidavit that Haneef told police in his first interview that he lived in Britain with the two terrorism suspects, his cousins: \"On 2 July and 3 July 2007 Dr Haneef participated in a taped record of interview with the AFP and stated the following: Whilst in the UK he resided with suspects 1 and 2 (alleged suicide bomber Kafeel Ahmed and his brother Sabeel Ahmed), at 13 Bentley Road, Liverpool.\"", "In subsequent Immigration Department documents used to advise Australian Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews, senior public servant Peter White asserted: \"Dr Haneef advised the AFP that he resided with Dr Sabeel Ahmed at a boarding house located at 13 Bentley Road, Liverpool, UK.\" This error was not corrected by the AFP, and revealed by Hedley Thomas on 20 July in The Australian.", "Haneef told police that he had moved out of 13 Bentley Road by the time that Sabeel Ahmed moved there.

An offence under this section of the Act carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. The basis of the charge was the allegation that he had intentionally provided support to an organisation, deemed to be a terrorist organisation under the terms of the act, whilst being reckless as to whether it was a terrorist organisation. The allegation centered on the gift of his own SIM card to his cousin, Sabeel Ahmed.", "Commonwealth prosecutor Clive Porritt had claimed that the SIM card was lent by Haneef to Sabeel Ahmed and was then passed to Khalid Ahmed before it was found in the wreckage of the Jeep Cherokee used in the Glasgow attack. It was subsequently reported by The Australian newspaper and ABC's AM program that the veracity of these claims are questionable, and that the SIM card was found in Liverpool at Sabeel Ahmed's residence."]}, {"page": "Kafeel Ahmed", "response": ["Ahmed was an Indian Muslim born in Bangalore, India and raised in Saudi Arabia during his doctor parents' tenure there.
