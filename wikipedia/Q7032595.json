It laid aside ideas of leys representing channels for earth energy, noting that this was beyond the realm of scientific verification, and instead focused on trying to build a case for ley lines that archaeologists could engage with. In particular, it drew attention to ethnographically recorded beliefs in the importance of lines running through the landscape in various communities around the world, proposing these as ethnographic comparisons for what might have occurred in prehistoric Britain. Hutton called the book \"an important development\", for it was \"by far the most well-researched, intelligently written and beautifully produced work yet published on leys\". Devereux pursued this approach in a series of further books."]}, {"page": "Runes", "response": ["Runes are popular in Germanic neopaganism, and to a lesser extent in other forms of Neopaganism and New Age esotericism.

After The Wiccan, it was only the second British outlet to do so, and gave space to practitioners of traditions other than the Gardnerian Wicca which dominated The Wiccan. 100 copies of the first issue were produced on a second-hand roneo duplicator which Howard had purchased from the redundancy payment given to him by EMI. 25 copies were placed in the Atlantis Bookshop while the rest were sent to Spectrum subscribers to complete their outstanding subscriptions. Over the coming forty years, The Cauldron published articles by a range of individuals associated with the study or practice of magic, including Ronald Hutton, Caroline Tully, Philip Heselton, Geraldine Beskin, Sorita d'Este, Rae Beth, Gareth Knight, Evan John Jones, and Nigel Pennick."]}, {"page": "List of writers on modern Paganism", "response": ["* Nigel Pennick (born 1946), English writer"]}]}}
