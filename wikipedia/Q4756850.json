The author of at least seven books of poetry, including Anxiety Before Entering a Room Selected Poems 1977\u201399 (Salt Publishing, 2001). His work as a literary and cultural critic is most recently on display in The Failure of Conservatism in Modern British Poetry (Salt Publishing, 2003).\nAndrew Duncan studied as a mediaevalist and started his writing career in punk \"fanzines\". He has been publishing poetry since the late 1970s, serving as the editor of the magazine Angel Exhaust. Duncan worked as a labourer (in England and Germany) after leaving school, and subsequently as a project planner with a telecomms manufacturer (1978\u201387), and as a programmer for the Stock Exchange (1988\u201391).He also publishes a website called pinko.org in which he aims to \"verbalize knowledge which a lot of people on the [underground poetry] scene share \u2013 not really to uncover completely new information\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Andrew Duncan (born 1956, E)"]}, {"page": "Philip Larkin", "response": ["Despite these recent developments, Larkin and his circle are nonetheless still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet Andrew Duncan, writing of The Movement on his pinko.org website, is of the opinion that \"there now seems to be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s\u2014an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents.\"Notes on the poetry of the 1940s: Pinko.org  Peter Riley, a participant in the British Poetry Revival, which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: \"What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable 'life'. W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas knew perfectly well that 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere.\""]}, {"page": "British Poetry Revival", "response": ["A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in Poetry Review under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, Bill Griffiths, Ulli Freer, cris cheek, Lawrence Upton, Robert Gavin Hampson, Robert Sheppard, and Ken Edwards were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at Gilbert Adair's Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as Caroline Bergvall, Paul Buck, Andrew Duncan, D. S. Marriott, Maggie O'Sullivan and Denise Riley. Edwards ran Reality Studios, a magazine that grew out of Alembic (UK poetry magazine), the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based Wendy Mulford, which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based Angel Exhaust magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, Robert Sheppard and Andrew Duncan. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's Figs magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets."]}, {"page": "Andrew Duncan", "response": ["Andrew Duncan may refer to:", "*Andrew Duncan (minister, died 1626) (c. 1560\u20131626), Scottish minister", "*Andrew Duncan (physician, born 1744) (1744\u20131828), Scottish pioneer for improved institutional care and treatment of mental health problems, founder of Royal Edinburgh Hospital", "*Andrew Duncan (minister, born 1766) (1766\u20131827), Moderator of the Church of Scotland in 1824", "*Andrew Duncan (physician, born 1773) (1773\u20131832), Scottish physician and professor at the University of Edinburgh", "*Andrew Duncan (mayor) (1834\u20131880), third mayor of Christchurch, New Zealand", "*Sir Andrew Duncan (businessman) (1882\u20131952), British businessman, MP and public official", "*Andrew Duncan (poet) (born 1956), British poet", "*Andrew Duncan (rugby league) (born 1972), British rugby league footballer", "*Andrew Duncan (director), Canadian television director and writer"]}, {"page": "Angel Exhaust", "response": ["Angel Exhaust is a British poetry magazine founded by Steve Pereira and Adrian Clarke in the late 1970s.

Barry's extended analysis of Seaport begins by noting its 'extensive use of \"incorporated data\" of various kinds', ranging from various literary sources (including works by Defoe, Melville, Hawthorne and Conrad) to 'historical accounts of the growth and development of the port, of the history of race relations in the city, newspaper accounts of local events and local guidebooks' (Contemporary British Poetry and the City, p.159). He concludes by describing this long poem as 'a large-scale vehicle of surprising flexibility which can accommodate the overtly political, the archival-historical and radically pared-down versions of poetry's more familiar affective modes' (Contemporary British Poetry and the City, p.162). Andrew Duncan similarly suggested that 'Seaport' was 'a major work, where the recovery of pure facts without explanatory annotation allows the build up of a new understanding on the large scale' (The Council of Heresy, p.\u00a029). Cutler argues that, in this work, Hampson 'shows the conflict between the different social typologies of space in the seaport'.Amy Cutler, 'Language Disembodied: The Coast and Forest in Modern British Poetry', Ph.D. Royal Holloway, University of London, 2017, p.166.
