He was one of over 900 children (including his sister Jade Stanger) who auditioned to star in Pooh's Heffalump Movie as the voice of Lumpy the Heffalump, or Heffridge Trompler Brompet Heffalump IV (4th), at the age of 5. He eventually won the role. His performance drew positive reviews, including Entertainment Weekly describing Lumpy as \"irresistibly voiced by 8-year-old Brit Kyle Stanger\" and New York Times critic Anita Gates's comment that \"adults as well as children may fall in love with Lumpy, partly because he's a sort of roly-poly lavender baby elephant but even more because of the endearing voice and infectious laugh of Kyle Stanger, a very young Briton making his movie and voice-over debut.\"He later returned in the sequel of sorts, Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1997 in American television", "response": ["|Kyle Stanger"]}, {"page": "Pooh's Heffalump Movie", "response": ["* Kyle Stanger as Lumpy the Heffalump", "American singer-songwriter Carly Simon wrote five new songs exclusively for the film and performed four of them (\"Winnie the Pooh\", \"Little Mr. Roo\", \"Shoulder to Shoulder\", and \"In the Name of the Hundred Acre Wood\"), while in \"The Horribly Hazardous Heffalumps!\" Simon is accompanied by Jim Cummings, Ken Sansom, John Fiedler, and Nikita Hopkins. \"The Name Game\" features Kyle Stanger and Nikita Hopkins as Lumpy and Roo."]}, {"page": "Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie", "response": ["* Kyle Stanger as Lumpy the Heffalump"]}, {"page": "1997 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Kyle Stanger, actor"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2005", "response": ["| Pooh's Heffalump Movie || Walt Disney Pictures || Frank Nissen (director); Brian Hohlfeld, Evan Spiliotopoulos (screenplay); Jim Cummings, John Fiedler, Ken Sansom, Peter Cullen, Kath Soucie, Brenda Blethyn, Nikita Hopkins, Kyle Stanger || Family ||"]}, {"page": "List of Winnie-the-Pooh characters", "response": ["He is voiced by Kyle Stanger in the films, by Oliver Dillon in My Friends Tigger & Pooh, and by Amelia Stanger in Kingdom Hearts III."]}, {"page": "Stanger (surname)", "response": ["* Kyle Stanger (21st century), British child voice actor"]}, {"page": "Kyle (given name)", "response": ["*Kyle Stanger (born 1997), British actor"]}]}}
