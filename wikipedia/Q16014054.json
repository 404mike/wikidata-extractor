The pair had broken into a warehouse in Croydon and were pursued by Fairfax onto the roof of the building. The police officer grabbed Bentley, when Craig shot him, grazing his shoulder. Despite his injury, the unarmed Fairfax chased Bentley and managed to arrest and subdue him. More officers arrived at the scene and Constable Sidney Miles scaled the roof, only to be shot dead by Craig, who then jumped from the roof after expending his ammunition, injured himself upon landing, and was arrested. The award of the medal was announced in the London Gazette of 6 January 1953, as were the George Medals awarded to Police Constables Norman Harrison and James McDonald. Police Constable Robert Jaggs was given the British Empire Medal and Police Constable Miles was posthumously awarded the Queen's Police Medal for Gallantry.In January 1953 he was transferred to duties in London's West End. Fairfax made a full recovery from his injuries and was promoted to Detective Sergeant on the day that he was awarded the GC. He retired from the police force in April 1962 after nearly 26 years of service. He ran a tobacco/sweet shop before selling the business to set up his own private investigations agency. Fairfax Investigators Ltd, which proved a success, was sold in 1980. He retired to Dorset, where he was an active Freemason. Fairfax was a boxer in his youth, and in retirement became a boxing judge.Frederick Fairfax died in Yeovil on 23 February 1998, just a few months before Bentley had his conviction quashed for the murder of Police Constable Miles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick William Fairfax", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Fairfax"]}, {"page": "Frederick Fairfax", "response": ["#REDIRECT Fred Fairfax"]}]}}
