A hectic day finished with confirmation of Alexander's official appointment as team manager. Three other senior players, Tony Battersby, Kingsley Black, and Ian Hamilton, would later leave the club by mutual consent as their contracts, including appearance money, had made them too expensive for Alexander's plans."]}]}}
