A win against Leicester City then gave Villa their best start to a season since 1930. On 26 December, Smith oversaw his century of competitive games as manager of Aston Villa with a 3\u20130 victory over Crystal Palace despite his team being reduced to ten men for the majority of the game due to Tyrone Mings' first half dismissal. Smith was named as Premier League Manager of the Month for December as Villa conceded just one goal in their five league games. He made one signing in the January transfer window: midfielder Morgan Sanson from Marseille for \u00a314 million. Aston Villa ended the campaign in 11th-place and Smith was keen to strengthen the squad further."]}, {"page": "List of Aston Villa F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Ollie Watkins"]}]}}
