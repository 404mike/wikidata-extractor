A cultured and stylish defender, he had the ball control skills of a midfielder. He played 457 league games in a seventeen-year career in the English Football League.\nHe started his career at Aston Villa in 1980, before he moved on to Middlesbrough seven years later. He spent two seasons at \"Boro\", helping the club to promotion out of the Second Division via the play-offs in 1988, before he was sold on to Port Vale in February 1989 for \u00a3200,000. He spent nine years at Vale, becoming a club legend for his service. During that time he helped the club to win promotion out of the Third Division via the play-offs in 1989, and then out of the Second Division in 1993\u201394. He also played in the club's victory in the 1993 Football League Trophy final, as well as the defeat in the final of the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1996. He was also named on the PFA Team of the Year in 1993\u201394. He moved on to non-league Kidderminster Harriers in 1998, before retiring the following year.\nHe joined the back-room staff at Port Vale, and was promoted to first team manager in October 2008, vacating the post in May 2009.

However, Horton left in February 2004, unwilling to accept the financial cutbacks imposed by the new board, and was replaced by former player Martin Foyle. Foyle was dismissed in November 2007, and his successor, Lee Sinnott, proved unable to prevent the club from being relegated into League Two after a 23rd-place finish and also oversaw a defeat to Southern League Division One Midlands club Chasetown in the FA Cup. Sinnott was sacked in September 2008 and following an unsuccessful tenure from Dean Glover, Micky Adams was appointed as the club's new manager in June 2009. Adams left the club in December 2010 with Vale second in the table and Jim Gannon was selected to finish the promotion job. However, Gannon's turbulent reign ended after 74 days.

However \"legal complications\" meant he would only sign a contract nearly two months later. Chairman Bill Bratt stated that Adams' first goal would be to stabilise the club, following the \"Valiants\" fall from the second tier to near the bottom of the English Football League within ten years. He made his first signing on 15 June, bringing in 21-year-old midfielder Tommy Fraser, who had played for Adams at Brighton.

A new club record was set in January 1989, as Rudge purchased classy defender Dean Glover from Middlesbrough for \u00a3200,000. The next month he added Liverpool winger John Jeffers to the squad for \u00a335,000, using the money he received from selling Steve Harper to Preston North End. To boost the side for the oncoming 1989\u201390 season, defender Neil Aspin was purchased from Leeds United for \u00a3150,000, Aspin would play over 300 games for Vale in the next ten years. \u00a3125,000 was splashed out on striker Nicky Cross, who would play around 150 games over the next five years.

On 28 July, Gall joined Lincoln City on a five-month loan deal, but failed to score in his time at Sincil Bank and returned to Carlisle at the start of 2009. On 24 February, he was loaned out to Port Vale, and manager Dean Glover hoped Gall's pace and tenacity would help resurrect some of Vale's season. Despite not scoring in his seven games, Glover was keen to extend Gall's loan, however a calf injury ruled out this option for the cash strapped club. He was released by Carlisle at the end of the 2008\u201309 season and he had a trial with former club Yeovil in July. During the week before Darlington's game against his former club Port Vale, at the weekend on 22 August 2009, it was announced that the club had signed Gall on a free transfer.

He was also entrusted with the club's captaincy. He played 46 games in the 1990\u201391 season, and scored his first goal for the \"Valiants\" in a 3\u20132 win over Portsmouth on 19 January. He was consistent again in the relegation season of 1991\u201392, making another 46 appearances.

However, hours later, confusion arose when Sinnott denied resigning. Five days later he was named the new Port Vale manager, ending the speculation about his future. Prominent backroom staff member Dean Glover had hoped to gain the management spot himself, and so pondered resigning from the club, but eventually chose to remain as Sinnott's assistant. The only significant staff member Sinnott was allowed to bring in was scout Steve Joesbury. In his first league game in charge Vale lost to local rivals Crewe Alexandra. Sinnott achieved his first win in charge of the club at Morecambe in the FA Cup First Round, with Port Vale winning 2\u20130. However the Second Round held embarrassment for both Sinnott and the club, as Southern League side Chasetown (an eighth tier team 101 league places below the Vale) picked up a 1\u20131 draw at Vale Park, before making a giant-killing with a late goal on their home ground, after Luke Rodgers missed two penalties. Sinnott warned of big changes at the club. He signed Chasetown duo Chris Slater and Kyle Perry, and heavily exploited the loan market. He ultimately proved unable to save the club from relegation, and they were relegated on 12 April 2008. With only 38 points from 46 games, they finished ahead of bottom-placed Luton Town only thanks to a ten-point deduction inflicted upon Luton. In the summer ten players left or were offloaded by Sinnott, as he attempted to make room for new signings.", "To make a success of the 2008\u201309 season, Sinnott brought in former Hereford United defender John McCombe, and former Middlesbrough midfielder Steve Thompson. Both players cited Sinnott as their reason for joining the club. He also added experienced defender Sam Stockley (Wycombe Wanderers); attacker Rob Taylor (Nuneaton Borough); midfielder Anthony Griffith (Doncaster Rovers); and attacking midfielder Louis Dodds (Leicester City) to the squad. Lee Collins also joined on an extended loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers, and would sign a permanent contract with the club in January. He appointed Stockley as his captain. The team continued to struggle, and on 18 September Sinnott admitted that \"we are looking to improve, without a shadow of a doubt\". However a 4\u20131 home defeat to Macclesfield Town two days later would prove to be Sinnott's last game in charge. He was sacked two days later, with the \"Valiants\" lying in 16th place. Three months on from his sacking, the club were yet to reach a compensation settlement with Sinnott, before an agreement was reached in February 2009. The club went on to finish the season in 18th place under Dean Glover.
