Sharp, both foundational feminist geographers and scholars, describe the struggle of gaining recognition in academia, saying that \"[it has been] a long struggle to gain recognition within geography as a discipline that gender relations are a central organizing feature both of the material and symbolic worlds and of the theoretical basis of the discipline.\" Feminist geographers struggle in academia in a variety of ways. Firstly, ideas that originate from feminist discourse are often seen as commonsense once the wider field accepts them, thereby rendering geography that is explicitly feminist invisible. Furthermore, feminist geography is understood to be the only subfield of geography where gender is explicitly addressed, permitting the wider discipline to disengage from feminist challenges. Finally, within the field, some geographers believe that feminist practice has been fully integrated into the academy, making feminist geography obsolete."]}, {"page": "Fl\u00e2neur", "response": ["Twenty-first century literary criticism and gender studies scholarship has proposed  for the female equivalent of the , with some additional feminist re-analysis. This proposal derives from the argument that women conceived and experienced public space differently from men in modern cities. Janet Wolff, in The Invisible Fl\u00e2neuse: Women and the Literature of Modernity (1985), argues that the female figure of the fl\u00e2neuse is absent in the literature of modernity, because public space had been gendered in modernity, leading, in turn, women's exclusion from public spaces to domestic spaces and suburbs. Elizabeth Wilson, on the other hand, in The Sphinx in the City: Urban Life, the Control of Disorder, and Women (1991), points out women's diverse experiences in public space in the modern metropolises such as London, Paris, Vienna, Berlin, discussing how the modern city was conceived as a place of freedom, autonomy, and pleasure, and how women experienced these spaces. Linda McDowell, in Gender, Identity and Place: Understanding Feminist Geographies (1999), expands this understanding to explain how public space was not experienced as a homogeneous and fixed space, and how women used particular public spaces such as beaches, cafes, and shopping malls to experience this autonomy. Departing from Wilson's approach, Lauren Elkin's Fl\u00e2neuse: Women Walk the City in Paris, New York, Tokyo, Venice, and London (2017) traces a number of fl\u00e2neuse women in history, such as Agn\u00e8s Varda, Sophie Calle, Virginia Woolf, Martha Gellhorn, focusing on their particular relationships with particular cities.
