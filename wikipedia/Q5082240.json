He had an elder brother, Frederick, and an elder sister, Alice Kathleen. After schooling at Giggleswick School to the age of 14, Charles was apprenticed as a plumber. He completed his apprenticeship and went on to work in the family woolen mill business during the 1920s. He spent some time in Belgium, at the associate company that worked with the woolen mill. In 1921, the family also acquired the Villa Walburg in the town of Epstein outside Frankfurt in Germany, at which they spent their annual summer holiday until its sale in 1933. Around 1919, George Henry Rycroft, in partnership with a Mr Hartley, purchased a rubber plantation in British Malaya at Perak; to the south south east of Penang. This plantation was named Harcroft (a portmanteau of Hartley and Rycroft). The eldest son Frederick Rycroft (1894\u20131984) was despatched to run the new business, but was recalled in 1922 after a business disagreement with his father. After about two years with a manager running the estate, who was finally sacked, Charles was dispatched to Malaya in 1924 to turn around the problems that had been caused."]}, {"page": "Rycroft baronets", "response": ["Two other members of the family may also be mentioned.

However, Reich emphasised the libido theory exactly when it was being discarded by psychoanalysis. Freud had reasoned that sexual maladaption caused the active damming-up of \"sexual stuff\" and defined \"actual neurosis\" as anxiety based on dammed-up libido. However, Freud abandoned his view in the 1920s and postulated the never popularly accepted death instinct to explain the destructive behaviour that was earlier attributed to frustrated libido. Reich's view of the relationship between actual and psychoneuroses has not found its way into psychoanalytic thinking. However, it has the advantage of connecting psychopathology with physiology and, according to Charles Rycroft, this makes Reich the only psychoanalyst to provide any explanation as to why childhood pathogenic experiences (causing neuroses in classical psychoanalysis) do not disappear when neurotics leave their childhood environment."]}, {"page": "Rycroft", "response": ["*Charles Rycroft (businessman) (1901\u20131998), British businessman and philanthropist", "*Charles Rycroft (1914\u20131998), British psychologist and writer"]}, {"page": "Sylvia Payne", "response": ["Payne developed an interest in psychoanalysis during the war and began training with Edward Glover at the Medico-Psychological Clinic on Brunswick Square, London.
