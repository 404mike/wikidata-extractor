He was elected for Moss Side in a by-election in 1961 caused by the death of the Conservative incumbent James Watts, and held the seat until he was defeated by Labour's Frank Hatton in February 1974, partly due to Taylor's seat having been merged with part of Hatton's former seat of Manchester Exchange.", "link_mentions": {}}}
