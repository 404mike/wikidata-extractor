He scored a goal in each of his first two appearances for the club, which came in the early rounds of the EFL Cup, but a foot injury suffered in October 2018 ruled him out for two months. The unavailability of Chris Mepham and new head coach Thomas Frank's deployment of three centre backs saw Jeanvier win a starting place on his return to fitness in December 2018 and he remained a near-ever present starter until the end of the 2018\u201319 season."]}, {"page": "Brentford F.C.

In April 2014, after the first team's promotion to the Championship for the 2014\u201315 season, then-U18 defender Richard Bryan said he believed that the academy could step up to produce players to play at Championship level, saying \"for all the players here that want to get into the first team, it is definitely another step up and a harder challenge, but they have got to step up to the plate and be ready for it. There is a hunger in the team and in the coaches\". An indicator of the academy beginning to bear fruit was evidenced by the call ups of Joshua Bohui, Harry Francis and Ross McMahon to England and Scotland youth-level training camps respectively during the 2014\u201315 season. Julius Fenn-Evans won Wales U16 caps in April 2015, Ian Poveda represented England at U16 level in August 2015 and Joshua Bohui made his England U17 debut in February 2016. In March 2018, central defender Chris Mepham became the first former academy player to be capped at full international level (by Wales) and in January 2019 he transferred away from the club for an undisclosed fee, reported to be \u00a312.5 million.", "* Chris Mepham*", "|Chris Mepham"]}, {"page": "Regan Poole", "response": ["Poole was named in a preliminary senior Wales squad in May 2018 for a friendly against Mexico, but was left out of the final selection.
