Duncombe was a tireless champion of radical causes in the 27 years he served the North East London borough of Finsbury. But he was equally well known for his style; he was, it was often said, \"the handsomest and best-dressed man in the house,\" and his love for theatre, gaming and women were well publicized. Duncombe was elected and then returned to his seat seven times by the shopkeepers, artisans and laborers, the Nonconformists, Catholics, and Jews of Finsbury, making him the longest-sitting representative of a metropolitan borough in his day. His constituents called him \"Honest Tom Duncombe\" with great affection; to his detractors he was known as the \"Dandy Demagogue\" or the \"Radical Dandy\". His name was celebrated in working men's newspapers and frequently mentioned in the gossip sheets of high society. Duncombe was, as The Times put it delicately upon his death, a \"character\".\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
