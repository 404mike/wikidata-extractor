In The Time Warrior (1973\u201374), Commander Linx quotes Sontaran military intelligence as describing the Time Lords as \"A race of great technical achievement, but lacking the morale to withstand a determined assault.\" In Pyramids of Mars (1975), Sutekh calls the Time Lords \"a perfidious species\".

In \"The Witch's Familiar\" (2015), Davros describes a prophecy that spoke of a \"hybrid creature [of] two great warrior races forced together to create a warrior greater than either,\" and believes that the creature being referred to was \"half Dalek, half Time Lord.\" In \"Before the Flood\" (2015), the Fisher King describes the Time Lords as \"the most warlike race in the galaxy\".

In \"Knock Knock\" (2017), the Twelfth Doctor tells Bill Potts the Time Lords are \"my species\".

Due to the quick turnaround required for the script, Nation and script editor David Whitaker decided to base the serial around a series of \"mini-adventures\", each with a different setting and cast; Nation was intrigued by the idea of the TARDIS crew searching for parts of a puzzle. As the first two episodes were written with mostly interior sets, Nation wanted to tell a story more \"out in the open\", setting the third episode in a jungle to allow the designer an opportunity for different settings. Whitaker suggested a cold snow-scape setting for the fourth episode to contrast with the hot jungle. Nation used many existing words for location and character names in the story: Marinus originated from the Latin word marinus, meaning \"of the sea\"; Morphoton is based on Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams; Millennius came from the term millennium, for a thousand years; and Arbitan is based on the Latin word Arbiter, meaning a judge.

Braxton was also disappointed with other production \"shortcomings\", such as the \"cheap-looking\" cave set, the dinosaur, and \"Carey Blyton's electro-bagpiped Silurian theme\". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn wrote that it \"keeps a snappy pace throughout thanks to Malcolm Hulke's well-plotted script\".

DVD Talk's John Sinnott noted that some parts were \"a bit slow\" due to the length, but it was a \"mature\" story where Pertwee defined his Doctor. However, Sinnott felt that John was still trying to find her character's place, and did not have much chemistry with Pertwee. Den of Geek gave a positive review of the serial, writing that \"the production is only marred by its excessive number of episodes compared to the story it had to tell ... and an often-appalling 'medieval' score by experimentalist Carey Blyton\". In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed Episode Six's cliffhanger as one of the best in all of Doctor Who.

On Uxarieus, the Doctor encounters a three-way battle between farmers, miners, and autochthonous \"primitives\"\u2014and also his nemesis the Master, who reveals to the Doctor that the primitives were once an advanced civilization.

It would further be deferred in January 1964 when it was realised that substantial rewrites would need to be undertaken. The story would have concerned a planet in an orbit opposite Earth's, with a parallel but in some ways opposite society to ours; for example, women were to be the dominant sex and all clovers would have four leaves. The original script was sent back for rewrites, and due to a pay dispute the rewrites were not made until after Susan had left the series; this necessitated further rewriting. A third submission was similarly rejected as Ian and Barbara were due to leave, and the script was dropped. The story was the subject of an April Fool's Day prank in 1983, when Doctor Who Magazine issue 76 claimed that one episode had in fact been filmed and rediscovered, and would be integrated into a twentieth anniversary special co-starring the Fifth Doctor entitled The Phoenix Rises.", "Written by Malcolm Hulke.. The story involved the departure of the Romans from Britain around the start of the fifth century in the midst of clashes against the Celts and the Saxons, culminating with the time travellers fleeing the indigenous savages back to the safety of the TARDIS. Britain 408 AD was first submitted on 2 September 1963. Story editor David Whitaker asked Hulke to revise his original storyline as he felt that the plot\u2014with its many opposing factions\u2014was too complicated, and that the serial's conclusion echoed that of An Unearthly Child too closely. It was hoped that an amended version of Britain 408 AD might occupy the sixth slot of Season One (Serial F), to be directed by Christopher Barry, but on 23 September it was decided that the production block did not need another historical story and Hulke's serial was abandoned. The spot in the schedule was ultimately occupied by The Aztecs, while Hulke began work on The Hidden Planet instead (see above). Following Whitaker's departure, Hulke resubmitted Britain 408 AD. It was rejected on 2 April 1965, by Whitaker's successor, Dennis Spooner, because the Romans had already featured in his own story The Romans.Doctor Who \u2013 The Handbook: The First Doctor; Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition #7", "Written by Brian Hayles. This story was Hayles' first submission to the series. The story focused the Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Vicki landing the TARDIS on the planet Numir, the sun of which is extinguished, and encounter the surface dwelling 'light people' and the subterranean 'shadow people'. The story was rejected in favour of Bill Strutton's The Web Planet by story editor Dennis Spooner on 8 February 1965, because the story was too similar to Malcolm Hulke's The Hidden Planet.

Ellis & Hulke would reuse the faceless aliens for their successful script submission The Faceless Ones.", "Written by Malcolm Hulke, not much is known about it, this six-part story was commissioned on 5 July 1968. The serial was cancelled on 30 December 1968 and its production budget allocated to The War Games, which Hulke co-wrote with Terrance Dicks, allowing that story to be expanded to 10 episodes.", "During the late sixties, a radio series starring Peter Cushing, who had played a human version of Doctor called \"Dr. Who\" in feature films featuring the Daleks, had been planned to be produced.

The pilot story titled \"Journey into Time\"' featured The Doctor and his granddaughter travel to the time of the American Revolution. The script was written by future Doctor Who television series writer Malcolm Hulke. The recording remains lost.
