Over the next few years, she built her reputation as one of the UK's premier hair extensionists by combining micro rings with high-quality Russian hair and her proprietary \"strand-by-strand\" colour blending technique.  But it was on the back of the British Broadcasting company (BBC Three) documentary Jamelia: Whose Hair Is It Anyway? that she rose to prominence Jamelia: Whose Hair Is It Anyway? and at the height of the financial crisis Karelina took a leap of faith and set up her own salon in Kensington, England.  Success quickly followed and she opened a second salon in Manchester in 2010.  In 2011, Karelina was approached by Sky UK's Moscow correspondent, Amanda Walker to accompany her to Russia to film a documentary on the hair extension industry in Russia. In 2015, Karelina rebranded from Tatiana Hair Extensions to Tatiana Karelina as a precursor for their entry into the United States.  In February 2016, Karelina made her foray into session styling at the Felder Felder London Fashion Week show where she was credited with creating one of the most talked-about hairstyles of the week, the Unicorn Braid. In October 2017, Karelina opened a salon in West Hollywood and her proximity to Hollywood enabled her to expand her celebrity clientele roster which now includes Ariana Grande, Lindsay Lohan, Stacey Solomon, and Bianca Gascoigne,"]}]}}
