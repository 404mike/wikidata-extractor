The Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Clarendon, wrote a letter to Russell on 26 April 1849, urging that the government propose additional relief measures: \"I don't think there is another legislature in Europe that would disregard such suffering as now exists in the west of Ireland, or coldly persist in a policy of extermination.\" Also in 1849, the Chief Poor Law Commissioner, Edward Twisleton, resigned in protest over the Rate-in-Aid Act, which provided additional funds for the Poor Law through a 6d in the pound levy on all rateable properties in Ireland. Twisleton testified that \"comparatively trifling sums were required for Britain to spare itself the deep disgrace of permitting its miserable fellow-subjects to die of starvation\". According to Peter Gray in his book The Irish Famine, the government spent \u00a37\u00a0million for relief in Ireland between 1845 and 1850, \"representing less than half of one percent of the British gross national product over five years. Contemporaries noted the sharp contrast with the \u00a320 million compensation given to West Indian slave-owners in the 1830s.\""]}, {"page": "Legacy of the Great Irish Famine", "response": ["A claim was made by a US professor of law, Francis Boyle that the Famine was genocide by the English against the Irish, meaning that the famine was part of a deliberate policy of planned extermination.  One US historian, James Mullin, insists that what happened can be described as genocide, sometimes accusing other historians, statisticians, and researchers who state otherwise of pushing a British point of view, or of revisionism, rewriting history to make excuses for British imperialism.Americanchronicle.com However, professional US, British, and Irish historians, such as Professors F.S.L. Lyons, John A. Murphy, Roy Foster, and James S. Donnelly, Jr, as well as historians Cecil Woodham-Smith, Peter Gray, Ruth Dudley Edwards, and Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da have denied claims of a deliberate policy of genocide. All historians generally agree that British policies during the Famine (particularly those applied by the ministry of Lord John Russell) were misguided, ill-informed, and counter-productive, and that had a similar crisis occurred in England instead of Ireland then the government's response would have been very different."]}, {"page": "Peter Gray", "response": ["Peter Gray may refer to:", "*Peter Gray (historian) (born 1965), professor of modern Irish history at Queen's University Belfast", "*Peter Gray (chemist) (1926\u20132012), professor of physical chemistry at the University of Leeds", "*Peter Gray (Australian judge), Federal Court of Australia judge", "*Peter Gray (military historian), military historian at Birmingham University", "*Peter Gray (psychologist), American psychologist and author of the introductory psychology textbook, Psychology", "*Peter Gray (sailor) (born 1935), Irish Olympic sailor", "*\"Peter Gray\" (song), American ballad", "*Peter Gray (writer) (1807\u20131887), Scottish writer", "*Peter Gray (bioengineer) (born 1946), bioengineer in Australia"]}, {"page": "Chronology of the Great Famine", "response": ["*Peter Gray, The Irish Famine"]}, {"page": "Death or Canada", "response": ["* Peter Gray, Queen's University Belfast", "Set in early 1847, it follows the doomed Willis family, who were forced to leave their home in southwest Ireland to set out on a journey to Canada.
