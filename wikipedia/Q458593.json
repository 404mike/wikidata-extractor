In the same tournament Timmer reached the semifinal where he was eliminated by Hunter in three sets. Next year he faced Tilden again in an unsuccessful doubles final rematch; that time Timmer teamed with compatriot Arthur Diemer Kool, while Tilden chose Daniel Prenn. He also lost the mixed doubles final with Else St\u00f8ckel to Roderich Menzel and Margaretha Dros-Canters. A week later he met Menzel again for the singles trophy of the Grand Hotel Panhans Championships in Semmering where he was beaten in three straight sets. In October 1930 he celebrated a triple crown feat at the Welsh Covered Courts Championhships in Llandudno where he clinched the singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles. In November he won the Lowland Championships of England in Peebles. He endorsed the doubles final partnering Francis Fisher.", "He missed the whole 1931 season because of an illness. In early 1932 he suffered from pneumonia. In mid-June he made his comeback as a runner-up for the Queen's Club Championships having it lost to Jack Crawford in four sets. In Liverpool at the Northern tournament he clinched the title by defeating home-favorite Nigel Sharpe. The same year he played his first Dutch international final against von Kehrling but came short. The following year he went for the title again but was stopped the second time by Giorgio de Stefani in a four set final. Timmer found consolation in the doubles contest where he and Kehrling took revenge by defeating de Stefani and George Lyttleton-Rogers and gaining the title. The key of the winning form was that Timmer overcame his well-known weak serve. Also in 1933 he participated in the West of England Championships only losing to Daniel Prenn in the final. In the 1934 Dutch International Championships Timmer was eliminated early in the semifinal by Hermann Artens. He was also unsuccessful in retaining the doubles title with Kehrling as the Austrian duo of Artens and Georg von Metaxa won that title as well. He had to skip the 1937 season as a result of rheumatism in his shoulder. He fought one of his last matches in 1938 against Kenneth Gandar-Dower, a victory of only two sets."]}, {"page": "Prix de l'Op\u00e9ra", "response": ["| Daniel Prenn"]}, {"page": "List of people from Vilnius", "response": ["* Daniel Prenn (1904\u20131991), Russian-born German, Polish, and British world-top-ten tennis player"]}, {"page": "List of sportspeople with dual nationality", "response": ["|Daniel Prenn"]}, {"page": "1930 Wimbledon Championships", "response": [" Jack Crawford /  Elizabeth Ryan defeated  Daniel Prenn /  Hilde Krahwinkel, 6\u20131, 6\u20133 "]}, {"page": "1929 French Championships \u2013 Men's singles", "response": ["#  Daniel Prenn (third round)"]}, {"page": "1933 French Championships \u2013 Men's singles", "response": ["#  Daniel Prenn (fourth round)"]}, {"page": "1934 French Championships \u2013 Men's singles", "response": ["#  Daniel Prenn (third round)"]}]}}
