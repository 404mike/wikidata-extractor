He took one wicket in the first innings, that of former Nottinghamshire CB player Peter Wilshaw.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Taylor (cricketer, born 1990)", "response": ["At the age of 18, Taylor was included in Leicestershire's 12-man squad to face Worcestershire at New Road in April 2008. At the time he was still studying for his A-levels but was given permission to play. Leicestershire coach, Tim Boon, said that whether Taylor played depended on the pitch and if it merited an extra batsman. Taylor was selected and batted at seven and scored eight runs before being trapped leg before wicket (lbw) in his only innings by Kabir Ali. The game ended in a draw, as both teams were frustrated by the weather. Two months later he made his Twenty20 (T20) debut along with teammate Sam Cliff in a seven-wicket defeat against Derbyshire. Despite two late victories, including a win in the return fixture against Derbyshire at Grace Road where Taylor contributed 10, Leicestershire finished bottom of their group in the 2008 Twenty20 Cup. In a three-day tour match against Bangladesh A as part of their 2008 tour of England, Taylor made only his second first-class appearance. The match ended in a draw and Taylor made his maiden half-century of 51 from 109 balls before being caught off Shakib Al Hasan. Taylor finished his one-day season with two Natwest pro40 games against Derbyshire and Surrey. He top scored with 43 not out in a narrow six-run victory against Derbyshire and hit 37 in a loss against Surrey before being caught off youngster Stuart Meaker to end his Leicestershire season on a high. Taylor was awarded the Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year for his 898 runs for Shrewsbury School in 2008, at an average of 179.60. The award also recognised his Youth International appearances and his County matches."]}, {"page": "Oliver James (cricketer)", "response": ["While studying for his degree in Business Economics and Finance at Loughborough University, James made his first-class debut for Loughborough MCCU against Leicestershire in 2011.  In this match, which is his only first-class appearance to date, saw him dismiss James Taylor, only after Taylor had compiled his career best score of 237.  With the bat, James scored 8 runs in Loughborough's first-innings, before being dismissed by Sam Cliff, while in their second-innings he wasn't required to bat."]}]}}
