She taught about very abstract and metaphysical principles, but also sought to denounce and correct superstitions that, in her view, had grown in different esoteric religions. Some of these statements are controversial. For example, she quotes Anna Kingsford and Edward Maitland's book The Perfect Way. \"It is 'Satan who is the God of our planet and the only God', and this without any metaphorical allusion to its wickedness and depravity,\" wrote Blavatsky, in The Secret Doctrine. \"For he is one with the Logos.\" He is whom \"every dogmatic religion, preeminently the Christian, points out as [...] the enemy of God, [... but is] in reality, the highest divine Spirit\u2014Occult Wisdom on Earth. [...] Thus, the Latin Church [... and] the Protestant Church [... both] are fighting against divine Truth, when repudiating and slandering the Dragon of Esoteric Divine Wisdom. Whenever they anathematize the Gnostic Solar Chnouphis, the Agathodaemon Christos, or the Theosophical Serpent of Eternity, or even the Serpent of Genesis.\" In this reference Blavatsky explains that he whom the Christian dogma calls Lucifer was never the representative of the evil in ancient myths but, on the contrary, the light-bringer (which is the literal meaning of the name Lucifer). According to Blavatsky the church turned him into Satan (which means \"the opponent\") to misrepresent pre-Christian beliefs and fit him into the newly framed Christian dogmas. A similar view is also shared by some Christian Gnostics, ancient and modern."]}, {"page": "1873 in Australian literature", "response": ["* Edward Maitland \u2013 By and By: an historical romance of the future"]}, {"page": "June 1921", "response": ["*The first R38-class airship, the largest ever built by the British, completed its maiden voyage at Cardington, Bedfordshire.
