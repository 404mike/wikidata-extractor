Andrea Riseborough read the script to audition for the insurance investigator, who was later renamed Shazia and played by Kiran Sonia Sawar.

Both Brooker and Jones described the change as interesting, with Jones asking, \"How often do you see a mother reduced to this level of desperation?\" Though they questioned whether a woman would have the physical strength to dispose of a body, Riseborough argued that her character could find that strength in desperation. Brooker commented that \"the panicking male murderer is practically a trope\", so the gender change was \"refreshing\"."]}, {"page": "Vinay Patel", "response": ["In 2016, he wrote BBC One\u2019s honour killing drama Murdered By My Father.
