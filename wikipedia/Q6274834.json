Furthermore, her poem The Nun's Return to the World [...] may have been an influence on Lord Byron's The Prisoner of Chillon: Indeed, the late Professor Jonathan Wordsworth of St Catherine's College, Cambridge, in his lecture at the dedication service of Susanna's bicentenary memorial tablet in Carlisle Cathedral on 20 March 1994,Booklet , titled Poet of Friendship 1747-1797 said: 'We might be listening to Byron's Prisoner of Chillon.' Some evidence for this attribution is as follows: Blamire's half-sister, Bridget (1757-1832), offspring of Susanna Blamire's father's second marriage, took a huge interest in Susanna's poetic manuscripts, some of which she had prepared for publication. She married George Brown, a lawyer and Freeman of the City of Newcastle-on-Tyne. Following his premature death in 1795, she established Newbottle School, at Houghton-le Spring, County Durham, six miles from Anabella Milbanke\u2019s house in Seaham. It is quite possible that Byron could have read a manuscript or a transcript of Blamire's poems whilst at Seaham Manor, immediately after his marriage to Milbanke in 1815. Also, Bridget's son, William, (born 1787) was a tutor to Annabella until shortly after her marriage to Byron in 1815.A Passionate Poet, Susanna Blamire", "Hugh MacDiarmid praised her in a radio broadcast in 1947, as \"this sweet Cumbrian singer\". He insisted that her Scottish songs are \"the high-water mark of her achievement \u2026 so good that they can be set beside the best that have ever been produced by Scotsmen writing in their own tongue\". Jonathan Wordsworth, a great-nephew of William Wordsworth, dubbed her, in 1994, \"The Poet of Friendship\", predicting on BBC Radio Cumbria in 1998 that \"Susanna will eventually be seen as important as the other Romantic poets writing during the eighteenth century, and should be more widely read\".
