She was interested in communicating archaeology and art in new ways to new audiences, including through writing creatively and through film. In 1950 the British Film Institute made her a governor. Writing with empathy, in what became termed the 'archaeological imagination', was central to her practice. One of her first creative projects was as archaeological advisor to the Festival of Britain in 1951, where she produced the 'People of Britain' pavilion. The pavilion's architect was H T Cadbury Brown and it was designed by James Gardner. The vision of the pavilion created by Hawkes showed archaeological sites as if they were being discovered for the first time, proceeding chronologically from a prehistoric burial, to a Bronze Age gold necklace, to a Roman mosaic floor. From the Roman section, the visitors met a recreation of the Sutton Hoo ship burial."]}, {"page": "Expo 58", "response": ["This was produced by the designer James Gardner, architect Howard Lobb and engineer Felix Samuely.

This was the 1946 Britain Can Make It exhibition, organized largely at the instigation of the Council's director, S.C. Leslie. The design of the exhibition itself was co-ordinated by Chief Display Designer, James Gardner. The exhibition was held from September to November at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Part of the reason for choosing this venue was that many of the museum's main exhibits were still in their wartime evacuation storage, outside London. The venue was undamaged by bombing, empty and available, and itself in need of an attraction to restore its pre-war visitors."]}, {"page": "University of Brighton Design Archives", "response": ["The Design Archives has developed its collections since the 1990s and each archive has been acquired according to a specific collecting policy; to document aspects of twentieth-century design history with a strategic focus on the connections between them.
