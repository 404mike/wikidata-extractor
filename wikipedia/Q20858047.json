Joining them are Kaitlyn Dever as Zoe Murphy, Julianne Moore as Heidi Hansen, Amy Adams as Cynthia Murphy, Danny Pino as Larry Murphy, Nik Dodani as Jared Kleinman and Amandla Stenberg as Alana Beck. Stenberg will also collaborate with Pasek and Paul on the writing of \"The Anonymous Ones,\" a new song for her character, whose role has been expanded for the film.
