The character is introduced as part of the Liverpudlian criminal Barry family, with his mother Carol Barry (Z\u00f6e Lucker), and sisters Dynasty Barry (Abby Mavers) and Kacey Barry (Brogan Ellis). Barry is characterised as a villain who is unfocused and troublesome, but also has a complex personality. The absence of Barry's father has impacted his personality and created a dislike for authority. Au extensively researched troublesome children with absent fathers for his portrayal of the character.", "Barry is created as part of the Liverpudlian criminal Barry family, consisting of single mother Carol Barry (Z\u00f6e Lucker) and her three \"unruly\" children: son Barry Barry (Carl Au) and daughters Dynasty Barry (Abby Mavers) and Kacey Barry (Brogan Ellis). The children join Waterloo Road's new Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) in hope of making them exemplar students. Lucker liked the \"outrageous\" family unit, but admitted, \"you just wouldn't want the Barrys in your neighbourhood!\" Au felt welcomed by the cast and crew of Waterloo Road and enjoyed working in Greenock, where the drama is filmed. The actor enjoyed portraying the character because he differed to other characters that he has played. He added that he felt privileged to portray a multi-dimensional character."]}, {"page": "Waterloo Road (series 9)", "response": ["* Abby Mavers as Dynasty Barry (20 episodes)"]}, {"page": "Waterloo Road (series 10)", "response": ["* Abby Mavers as Dynasty Barry; Ex-pupil (1 episode)"]}, {"page": "Gary Mavers", "response": ["Mavers has three daughters, including fellow actress Abby Mavers, and is also the younger brother of The La's frontman Lee Mavers."]}, {"page": "I Am Vengeance", "response": ["*Abby Mavers as Lucy"]}]}}
