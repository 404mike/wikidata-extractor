He was born in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire and died at Holton cum Beckering in Lincolnshire.\nHodgson's role as a cricketer is not clear: he both opened the batting and batted as low as No 10 in the batting order in his three first-class games, one of which was the 1836 University Match against Oxford University; there is no evidence that he bowled in important matches. In six first-class innings, he scored just 18 runs.", "link_mentions": {}}}
