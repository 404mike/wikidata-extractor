That year, Turner persuaded the directors to change the name of the club to Oxford United, to increase public awareness of the club and to broaden its appeal. He employed more professional players, and brought in young players from top clubs. The likes of Graham Atkinson, Cyril Beavon and Maurice Kyle all joined from junior teams of bigger clubs and each went on to play over 300 games for Oxford United. Turner's key signing, the 20-year-old Ron Atkinson, joined from Aston Villa, was soon appointed captain, and went on to play 560 first team games for the club. The combination of Turner's management and Atkinson's captaincy brought two Southern League titles in two years, and when Accrington Stanley went bankrupt in 1962, Oxford United took their place in the Fourth Division of the Football League."]}, {"page": "Stuart Beavon (footballer, born 1984)", "response": ["He is the son of former Reading midfielder Stuart Beavon, and grandson of former Oxford United defender Cyril Beavon."]}, {"page": "Beavon", "response": ["*Cyril Beavon (born 1937), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2017 in association football", "response": ["* 22 December: Cyril Beavon, English footballer (born 1937)"]}, {"page": "2017 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Cyril Beavon, 80, footballer (Oxford United)."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 in English football", "response": ["* 22 December 2017: Cyril Beavon, 80, Oxford United defender."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2017", "response": ["*Cyril Beavon, 80, English footballer (Oxford United).Ex-Oxford United footballer and club stalwart dies"]}]}}
