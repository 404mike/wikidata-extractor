In 1981 he moved up to the British Formula Three Championship and finished 20th while competing in only three races. He returned to the series in 1982 for six races and made a single start in 1984 and 1985. He moved to German F3 in 1986 for a single race and full-time in 1987 finishing 9th in the championship. In 1987 he won the revived European Formula Three Championship which consisted of four races. He also returned to the Formula Ford Festival for the first time since 1984. Coyne bounced around various F3 series until 1990 when he finished 4th in the British Formula Renault Championship and won the Formula Ford Festival at the age of 32 (the race is usually won by much younger drivers). The win re-sparked his career a bit as he competed full-time in British Formula 3000 in 1991, finishing 5th. His professional career ended in 1993 after he finished 9th in British Formula Renault. He had been set to drive in the last five races of the 1993 Formula One season for Pacific but the team's decision to defer entry until 1994 ended the deal.Coyne returned to racing in 2005 racing a MTec built Superstox on the short oval tracks. His first win in the class came at the 2005 Spedeweekend.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1993 British Touring Car Championship", "response": ["|  Dave Coyne", "|  Dave Coyne"]}, {"page": "1991 International Formula 3000 Championship", "response": ["|  Dave Coyne", "|align=\"left\"|  Dave Coyne ", "| - ||align=\"left\"|  Dave Coyne ||align=\"left\"| GJ Motorsports ||align=\"left\"| Reynard ||align=\"left\"| Ford Cosworth ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| 14 ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| R ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFBBBF;\"| - ||style=\"background:#DFDDDF;\"| -"]}, {"page": "British Formula Ford Championship", "response": ["|  Dave Coyne"]}, {"page": "1987 Buenos Aires Grand Prix \u2013 1\u00b0 Festival Automolistico Internacional de Formula 3", "response": ["|  Dave Coyne"]}, {"page": "Formula Ford Festival", "response": ["|  Dave Coyne"]}, {"page": "1984 British Formula Three Championship", "response": ["|  Dave Coyne"]}, {"page": "1985 British Formula Three Championship", "response": ["|  Dave Coyne"]}, {"page": "1991 British Formula 3000 Championship", "response": ["|  Dave Coyne", "|  Dave Coyne", "|  Dave Coyne", "|  Dave Coyne", "|  Dave Coyne", "|align=left|  Dave Coyne"]}]}}
