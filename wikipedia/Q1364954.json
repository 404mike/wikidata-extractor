D. Ross, was a Scottish philosopher who is known for his work in ethics. His best-known work is The Right and the Good (1930), and he is perhaps best known for developing a pluralist, deontological form of intuitionist ethics in response to G. E. Moore's consequentialist form of intuitionism. Ross also critically edited and translated a number of Aristotle's works, in addition to writing on Greek philosophy.\nHis accomplishments include his work with John Alexander Smith on a 12-volume translation of Aristotle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thurso", "response": ["*Sir William David Ross, KBE (1877\u20131971) \u2014 moral philosopher, editor and translator of Aristotle."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (R\u2013Z)", "response": ["* William David Ross"]}, {"page": "William Ross", "response": ["*W.
