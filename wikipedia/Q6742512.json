The Potters struggled near the foot of the First Division table in the 1967\u201368 and 1968\u201369 campaigns, before rising to ninth place in the 1969\u201370 season. Banks remained a reliable stopper for the club, though on 1 March 1969 he was knocked unconscious at Roker Park by Sunderland's Malcolm Moore, and his replacement David Herd conceded four goals in a 4\u20131 defeat. Banks also played a season for the Cleveland Stokers of the American United Soccer Association in the summer of 1968: he played seven of the short-lived club's 12 games in Cleveland, Ohio."]}, {"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["* 1976  Malcolm Moore"]}]}}
