In the early 1980s, Hodder and his students at Cambridge first developed postprocessualism, an approach to archaeology stressing the importance of interpretation and subjectivity, strongly influenced by the Neo-Marxist Frankfurt School. Tilley and his early collaborator Daniel Miller were amongst the most strongly relativist of first wave postprocessualist archaeologists, and was particularly critical of what he saw as the negative political implications of positivist processual archaeology. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Tilley moved away from the structuralist approach pursued by Hodder and, along with Michael Shanks and Peter Ucko, advocated a position of strong relativism. For Shanks and Tilley, academic interpretations of the archaeological record have no more legitimacy than any other, and they view claims to the contrary as elitist attempts to control the past,. asserting that \"there is no way of choosing between alternative pasts except on essentially political grounds.\""]}, {"page": "Black Athena", "response": ["There is no archaeological evidence that would clearly indicate a colonization which Bernal suggests.

It questioned processualism's appeals to science and impartiality by claiming that every archaeologist is in fact biased by their personal experience and background, and thus truly scientific archaeological work is difficult or impossible. This is especially true in archaeology where experiments (excavations) cannot possibly be repeatable by others as the scientific method dictates. Exponents of this relativistic method, called post-processual archaeology, analysed not only the material remains they excavated, but also themselves, their attitudes and opinions. The different approaches to archaeological evidence which every person brings to his or her interpretation result in different constructs of the past for each individual. The benefit of this approach has been recognised in such fields as visitor interpretation, cultural resource management and ethics in archaeology as well as fieldwork. It has also been seen to have parallels with culture history.  Processualists critique it, however, as without scientific merit.  They point out that analysing yourself doesn't make a hypothesis any more valid, since a scientist will likely be more biased about himself than about artifacts.  And even if you can't perfectly replicate digs, one should try to follow science as rigorously as possible.  After all, perfectly scientific experiments can be performed on artifacts recovered or system theories constructed from dig information.", "After the turn of the millennium archaeological theory began to take on new directions by returning to the objects of archaeological study. Archaeologists, led by Laurent Olivier, Bj\u00f8rnar Olsen, Michael Shanks, and Christopher Witmore, argued for taking things seriously not only as mediators in what can be said about the past, but also in terms of the unique ways they hold on to  actions, events, or changes. For them, archaeology is less the study of the past through its material remains, than the study of things themselves with an aim to generate diverse pasts in the present.

Developers of this theory include Michael Shanks, Mike Pearson and Julian Thomas who in the 1990s at University of Wales, Lampeter began formulating concepts which view the social aspect of performance along with the artistic nature of theatre together through an interdisciplinary lens as \"an integrated approach to recording, writing and illustrating the material past\" thereby marrying the academic with the artistic. Performance archaeology has further expanded in the last decade upon the theories of presence. Geoff Bailey states that \"because we believe that the present is known or knowable better than the past, we must seek our inspiration in studies of present phenomena and our concepts and theories from authorities on the present.\" Michael Shanks along with Ian Hodder, Christopher Witmore, Gabriella Giannachi and Nick Kaye have recently expanded the theory further by calling for cooperation within the humanities and studying transdisciplinary research from archaeologists who are encouraged to become storytellers in order to more diversely analyze the engagement of the actor, the audience, the things and the space in which they perform by using an 'ecology of practices'.Witmore, C. and M.

(ed.) 2012. Archaeological Theory Today. Second Edition. Polity Press. The theory of performance archaeology aims to give researchers a multi temporal link to the antiquated through studying the processual nature of \"performance of presence\" which is entangled within the 'multipleness' of time. Echoing theories posited by Martin Heidegger, the processual and temporal natures of performance are phenomenologically entwined with the experiences of the performers and audience. Stories are preserved by memory through performance. These performances can be seen both in the archaeological record as well in modern enactments or rituals. The landscape itself is an integral portion of performance memory. Performance archaeology sets itself apart from performance history by directing focus not toward the past itself but instead toward what has become of the past by taking an ethnoarchaeological approach of analyzing the 'archaeology of present' cultures which allows for a richer interpretation of past performance. Performance archaeology takes a cross-disciplinary approach with 'social archaeology' to studying the things, narratives or artifacts, that remain of ancient theatre, music, dance, art history and oral tradition in order to 'model the past'. The following examples illustrate components that might aptly demonstrate aspects of performance archaeology."]}, {"page": "Left Coast Press", "response": ["Left Coast's first season in 2005 included books by archaeologists Brian Fagan,Moshenka, G. \"Review of Writing Archaeology,\" Papers of the Institute of Archaeology 18 (2007) pp. 190-192 Thomas King,Craib, J. \"Review of Doing Archaeology,\" Australian Archaeology 65 (2007) p. 56 and David Whitley.Gendron, D. \"Review of Introduction to Rock Art Research,\" Canadian Journal of Archaeology 31: 2 (2007) 261-263 In 2007, Left Coast became publisher for the UCL Institute of Archaeology, for which they published and distributed 67 titles by 2016.Whitehouse, R. \"Peter and Institute Publications,\" Archaeology International 10, p 21.
