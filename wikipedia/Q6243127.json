He is widely regarded as being the most successful manager in the history of Tranmere Rovers, and had a stand at Prenton Park named in his honour in 2002. In November 2014, a statue of King was unveiled outside the ground.\nHe played at wing half, and made 411 league appearances in a 14-year career in the Football League. He began his career at Everton, playing for the club in the top-flight between 1957 and 1960. He then moved on to Tranmere Rovers via Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. He helped Rovers to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1966\u201367, before he signed with Port Vale in June 1968. He helped the \"Valiants\" to promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1969\u201370, before he joined non-league Wigan Athletic in May 1971.\nHe found more success as a manager than as a player, gaining his first management post at former club Tranmere Rovers in April 1975. He led the \"Superwhites\" to promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1975\u201376, before he was sacked in September 1980. He then had successful spells in charge at non-league clubs Northwich Victoria (winning the FA Trophy in 1984) and Caernarfon Town, before making his return to Tranmere Rovers in 1987. He immediately steered the club away from losing their Football League status, before taking them to promotion in 1988\u201389. He further took them to the Associate Members' Cup title in 1990, the Football League Trophy final in 1991, as well as promotion out of the Third Division as winners of the play-offs. His team narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League, reaching the play-offs three times between 1993 and 1995, also reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup. Despite these achievements, he was not immune to being replaced when the team's form dipped, and he was \"moved upstairs\" to become Director of football in April 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Caernarfon Town F.C.", "response": ["The following season, Caernarfon moved into the newly created North West Counties League and achieved promotion, along with Radcliffe Borough, at the first attempt. In 1985, Caernarfon Town were runners-up in the first division and were elected to the Northern Premier League. Despite a poor start, new manager John King turned playing affairs round and the club enjoyed its most successful FA Cup run in 1986\u201387. Caernarfon Town defeated Fourth Division Stockport County at the Oval and then defeated Third Division York City in a replay before losing a third round replay again to Second Division Barnsley by a goal to nil. The Canaries finished third in the NPL and felt that, if not for the FA Cup run, they would probably have gained promotion to the Football Conference. In May 1987, King left to become manager of Tranmere Rovers and former Liverpool wing-half Tommy Smith was appointed manager but left in December 1987 after a series of poor results, giving way to Phil Wilson who had been a player with the club the previous season."]}, {"page": "John King", "response": ["* John King (painter) (1929\u20132014), English painter", "* John King (ukulelist) (1953\u20132009), American ukulele player", "* John King (author) (born 1960), English author of novels such as The Football Factory", "* John King (comics), a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe", "* John King (country singer) (born 1988), country musician", "* John King (record producer), American music producer, one of the Dust Brothers", "* John King, lead guitarist for American rock band The Litter.

With goalkeeper Stuart Sharratt out injured, he brought in Geoff Hickson on loan from Crewe Alexandra. Despite inconsistent results, fans threw their support behind Lee after witnessing consistent improvements in the Vale's performances. He solved his goalkeeping problems by signing Keith Ball from Walsall for 'a small fee', and his side put together a five-game unbeaten run in November. He adopted a more 'hit and run' style in March, and his side ended the campaign in 13th place with 46 points from their 46 games, scoring 46 and conceding 46 goals.", "For the 1971\u201372 campaign he released Mick Hopkinson, John Green, and John King; and signed left-half John Flowers from Doncaster Rovers and full-back Tony Loska from Shrewsbury Town for 'a small fee'. Pre-season did not run smoothly however, as Lee fell out with Sammy Morgan, and had to contend with injuries to Roy Sproson, Stuart Sharratt, and top-scorer John James. Low attendances forced him to sell Clint Boulton to Torquay United for \u00a310,000. In December, he brought Ray Harford from Mansfield Town for a \u00a35,000 fee, as well as Keith Lindsey from Southend United for 'a small fee'. War in the boardroom continued, whilst only 2,809 turned up to see a 1\u20130 home win over Mansfield Town on 4 March. On 8 May, Sproson made his farewell competitive appearance for the club in front of only 2,743 supporters, and Lee angrily declared that \"the attendance was nothing short of a disgrace to mark the end of a legend\". Safety was assured with a 15h place finish, five points above relegated Mansfield Town."]}, {"page": "Mark Ward (footballer, born 1962)", "response": ["Ward signed a two-year contract with Northwich Victoria of the Alliance Premier League after impressing in a trial game, and the club also found him a job in a bakery. He established himself in the first team and scored the winning goal against Football League side Chester City in the first round of the FA Cup at Drill Field in the 1982\u201383 season. He also scored the winning goal past Dagenham in the semi-finals of the FA Trophy, to book John King's \"Vics\" a place at Wembley Stadium in the final. They lost 2\u20131 to Telford United in the final, and Ward spent most of the game as little more than a spectator after being taken out by left-back Tony Turner in the opening stages of the match."]}, {"page": "John McGreal", "response": ["Born in Birkenhead, McGreal began his career with local club Tranmere Rovers at the age of 17 and moved from Warwick Rimmer's youth-team to the first-team set-up under John King in 1990. He scored his first and only goal for the club on 23 February 1994, in a 1\u20131 draw with Leicester City at Filbert Street. However he also scored the equalising goal for Leicester with an own goal when he sliced in Ian Ormondroyd's header, which would otherwise have gone wide. He played 27 games in the 1996\u201397 season as Tranmere finished 11th in the First Division under the stewardship of John Aldridge. He missed just four league games during the following campaign as Rovers posted a 14th-place finish. He featured 42 times in the 1998\u201399 season, helping Tranmere to another mid-table finish, in his final season at Prenton Park."]}]}}
