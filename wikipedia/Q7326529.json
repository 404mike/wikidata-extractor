He played for Darlington, Northampton Town, York City, Chester City, Shrewsbury Town, Wrexham and Grimsby Town, making over 350 appearances in the Football League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wrexham A.F.C.", "response": ["Expectations were high for the 2007\u201308 season, as there had been the signings of players such as Anthony Williams, Richard Hope, Michael Proctor, Silvio Spann and Eifion Williams and a push for promotion was expected by the fans after the disappointment of last season. But the season started badly, with only three wins and 10 points by the middle of November and Wrexham rooted to the bottom of the table."]}, {"page": "Rob Atkinson", "response": ["Rob Atkinson was initially signed for Grimsby Town on loan in November 2007 by Alan Buckley. He was drafted in as a covering defender, and was slotted in at centre back next to Nick Fenton. He scored his first goal for the club against Chester City on 1 January 2008. Atkinson went on to play he full 90 minutes at Wembley Stadium, in the Football League Trophy final defeat against MK Dons. Atkinson was singled out by Grimsby fans, as one of their more stronger players in the 2007\u201308 season, and in May 2008, Buckley revealed his desire to bring Atkinson back to the club on loan or possibly on a permanent deal. However at the time, nothing came of the transfer, and after Buckley signed centre backs Richard Hope and Matthew Heywood in pre-season, the Atkinson deal became dead in the water. On 31 October 2008 he re-signed for Grimsby on another loan deal, initially until January 2009. Town who were now managed by Mike Newell had signed Atkinson along with Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala, who was another former Grimsby player. Both transfers were made in the space of two days. Atkinson made his second debut for the club in a 2\u20131 defeat to Darlington when he came on as a substitute for skipper Matthew Heywood in the 30th minute of play. In January 2009 Rob's loan contract with Grimsby expired and he returned to Barnsley. However a day later he joined the club for a third spell, signing on an emergency loan deal to play the league fixture with Morecambe on 10 January. A deal was struck between Barnsley and Grimsby for a permanent switch that was completed two days later. Rob went on to cement a first team place at centre back alongside youngster Ryan Bennett, who had become the club's new captain, replacing Matt Heywood, who had been dropped due to poor performances. Atkinson and Bennett both were integral parts of the Grimsby squad that helped stave off relegation out of the Football League. During the 2009\u201310 season The Mariners suffered an eventual relegation, bowing out on the final day of the season."]}, {"page": "Ryan Bennett", "response": ["With the appointment of Mike Newell as first team manager in October 2008, Bennett was handed the captain's arm-band for the remainder of the 2008\u20132009 campaign aged only 18. This was down to the fact that the new signing Matthew Heywood, who had also been designated the new club captain had fallen out of favour following several unconvincing performances, and Newell had preferred a youthful back pairing of Bennett and Rob Atkinson to the veteran duo of Heywood and Richard Hope. Bennett was ever present for the club during the 2008\u201309 season, and his consistently solid performances throughout a very difficult season for Grimsby saw Bennett win firstly the PFA Player of the Month for February, which would eventually be followed by several club accolades. He swept the board at the GTFC Player of the Year ceremony in May 2009, claiming the \"Supporters Player of the Year\" award, ~\"Supporters Young Player of the year\" as well as many other minor awards. Newell made repeated reference to Bennett's professionalism and maturity, and his unflappable playing style in particular was impressive for such a young defender, whilst his height made him an asset at set pieces. Also Bennett was described as comfortable on the ball."]}, {"page": "Chris Smith (footballer, born 1981)", "response": ["Smith underwent a hernia operation in the close-season, but due to swelling and bruising around the bone his return was delayed and was an unused substitute for York's first match of 2003\u201304. He made his first appearance of the season as a second-half substitute for the injured Brass in a 2\u20130 defeat away to Bury on 30 September 2003, although Smith commented that: \"It was my first appearance but unfortunately it was not one to remember\". Due to injuries to other players, his first start of 2003\u201304 came in a 2\u20131 defeat away to Halifax in the Football League Trophy first round Northern section on 14 October 2003. This was followed by his first league start four days later in a 1\u20131 home draw with Boston, and York went on a seven-match unbeaten run in the league with Smith in defence alongside Brass and Richard Hope. He received his fifth yellow card of the season in a 2\u20131 away win over Rochdale on 28 December 2003, meaning he was suspended for York's match against Northampton Town on 17 January 2004. Smith was dropped for York's match against Scunthorpe on 9 March 2004 after failing to be vocal and organisational in defence in a 4\u20131 defeat away to Kidderminster three days earlier, which was expected of him due to Brass' absence. His return came in a 0\u20130 draw against Torquay on 13 March 2004, with Brass praising his performance. After York's relegation to the Conference National was confirmed in April 2004, it was announced that Smith would be released in the summer, despite having been verbally offered a new contract over a month before. He finished 2003\u201304 with 30 appearances."]}, {"page": "Ian Ramsey Church of England Academy", "response": ["* Richard Hope \u2014 Former footballer with Blackburn, Darlington and Northampton."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|06 ||  Richard Hope || Wrexham || 30 || Free Transfer", "|06 ||  Richard Hope || Retired || 30 || Released"]}, {"page": "Richard Paul Hope", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Hope (footballer)"]}, {"page": "2007 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["The match kicked off around 3p.m. on 26 May 2007 at Wembley Stadium in front of a crowd of 61,589. Three minutes into the match, Shrewsbury Town took the lead: Neil Ashton's free-kick from the right was met by Stewart Drummond  with a glancing header which sent the ball Bristol Rovers goalkeeper Steve Phillips into the bottom corner of the goal.  Ashton had an opportunity to equalise after Derek Asamoah's cross was passed on by Ryan Green but failed to connect with the ball.  In the 21st minute, Green took the ball down the right wing before crossing for Walker who struck the ball first time past Chris Mackenzie in the Shrewsbury Town goal.  Asamoah then found Cooke with a cross but the Shrewsbury striker was unable to convert the chance to score.  With ten minutes of the half remaining, Lewis Haldane passed the ball down the left, and after Richard Hope failed to make the interception, Walker took a controlling touch of the ball and lobbed it over MacKenzie to make it 2\u20131 before the interval.  Late in the second half, Shrewsbury Town's Marc Tierney was sent off after being shown a second yellow card following a late tackle on Campbell.  Two minutes into stoppage time, Shrewsbury Town won a corner for which their goalkeeper MacKenzie came up the pitch.  Bristol Rovers broke from the corner and Igoe was able to run with the ball before striking it into an empty goal.
