There was a more successful plantation in the county in the 17th century, which expanded the existing Scottish and English settlement with more landowners and tenants from both Scotland and England.

Both served Queen Mary until her death in 1558. Sidney played a large part in expanding the English administration in the country, which had shrunk over the centuries to the area around Dublin known as the Pale. He was also involved in the civil and military measures taken by his brother-in-law for bringing Irish chieftains into submission to the English Crown, known as Surrender and Regrant. In the course of the Lord Deputy's expedition to Ulster in 1557 Sidney devastated the island of Rathlin. In the following year, during the absence of Sussex in England, he had sole responsibility for the government of Ireland and conducted himself with marked ability. A second absence of the Lord Deputy from Ireland, on the accession of Queen Elizabeth, threw the chief control into Sidney's hands at the outbreak of trouble with Shane O'Neill, and he displayed great skill in temporising with the chieftain until Sussex reluctantly returned to his duties in August 1559. About the same time Sidney resigned his office of Vice-Treasurer of Ireland on his appointment as president of the council of the Marches in Wales, and for the next few years he resided chiefly at Ludlow Castle, with frequent visits to the court in London."]}, {"page": "Shane O'Neill (Irish chieftain)", "response": ["Shane O'Neill (; c. 1530 \u2013 2 June 1567), was an Irish chieftain of the O'Neill dynasty of Ulster in the mid-16th century. Shane O'Neill's career was marked by his ambition to be the O'Neill\u2014sovereign of the dominant O'Neill family of T\u00edr Eoghain\u2014and thus overlord of the entire province. This brought him into conflict with competing branches of the O'Neill family and with the English government in Ireland, who recognised a rival claim. Shane's support was considered worth gaining by the English even during the lifetime of his father Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone (died 1559). But rejecting overtures from Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, the lord deputy from 1556, Shane refused to help the English against the Scottish settlers on the coast of Antrim, allying himself for a short time instead with the MacDonnells, the most powerful of these settlers, Shane viewed the Scottish settlers as invaders, but decided to stay his hand against them with hopes of using them to strengthen his position with the English; however, tensions quickly boiled over and he declared war on the Scottish MacDonnell's defeating them at the Battle of Glentaisie despite the MacDonnells calling for reinforcements from Scotland.

The Duke of Anjou was in fact the only one of Elizabeth's foreign suitors to court her in person. He was 24 and Elizabeth was 46. Despite the age gap, the two soon became very close, Elizabeth dubbing him her \"frog\". While a few believe this nickname arose from a frog-shaped earring he had given her, \"frog\" has been an unflattering slang nickname for the French for centuries \u2013 similar to the slang nicknames of \"Limey\" for the British and \"kraut\" for Germans. Queen Elizabeth often used unflattering slang names for her favourites \u2013 such as \"pygmy\" for Robert Cecil who was short of stature and humped from spinal scoliosis. Thus her use of the slang name \"frog\" was consistent with her habits. Whether or not Elizabeth truly planned to marry Anjou is a hotly debated topic. She was quite fond of him, knowing that he was probably going to be her last suitor. Many anecdotes recount their flirting. The match was controversial among the English public: English Protestants warned the Queen that the \"hearts [of the English people] will be galled when they shall see you take to husband a Frenchman, and a Papist ... the very common people well know this: that he is the son of the Jezebel of our age\",From Sir Philip Sidney's letter to Elizabeth I on the subject of Anjou (1579), in Katherine Duncan-Jones and Jan van Dorsten, eds, Miscellaneous prose of Sir Philip Sidney (1973) pp. 46-57 referring to the Duke's mother, Catherine de' Medici. Among members of Elizabeth's Privy Council, only William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex supported the marriage scheme wholeheartedly. Most notable councillors, foremost among them Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and Sir Francis Walsingham, strongly opposed it, even warning the Queen of the hazards of childbirth at her age."]}, {"page": "Baron FitzWalter", "response": ["right|thumb|220px|Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex and 12th Baron FitzWalter", "*Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, 3rd Viscount FitzWalter, 12th Baron FitzWalter (c. 1525\u20131583)"]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Spain", "response": ["|John Russell, 1st Earl of BedfordThomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex"]}, {"page": "St Margaret's, Westminster", "response": ["Notable windows include the east window of 1509 of Flemish stained glass, created to commemorate the betrothal of Catherine of Aragon to Henry VIII.
