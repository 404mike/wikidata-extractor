However, the post of Professor of Scots Law at the University of Edinburgh became vacant in 1737, with the death of its incumbent Alexander Bain. The University is a modern (that is, a post-Reformation foundation, so the appointment of professors lay with the Town Council, which asked the Faculty of Advocates to suggest two names. The second was normally one who was certain to refuse, so the fact that John Erskine was the other nominee shows the esteem in which he was now held in the profession (though no doubt his connections in the Erskine and Dundas families also played their part).", "Erskine was twice married.
