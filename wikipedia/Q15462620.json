In the Victorian era, the painting Edward\u00a0II and Piers Gaveston by Marcus Stone strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit. It was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872 but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive. More recently, the director David Bintley used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet Edward\u00a0II, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward\u00a0II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th\u00a0century."]}, {"page": "Alistair MacLeod", "response": ["In the British newspaper, The Observer, Stephanie Merritt pointed out that when it was first published, No Great Mischief drew \"unqualified praise\" from the critics.
