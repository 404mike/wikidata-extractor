The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and South African all rounder Ryan McLaren had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's Twenty20 competition against the other team. On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach Nick Denning as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the Southern Vipers. The Vipers then won the inaugural Kia Super League on 21 August, defeating Western Force in the final by 7 wickets. Overseas star Suzie Bates was named as player of the tournament. For the male team though it was a season of disappointment. A large number of injuries at the start of the season, including to fast bowlers Reece Topley, Fidel Edwards, Chris Wood and Ryan Stevenson, coupled with poor form and tough circumstances, after the death of trialist fast bowler Hamza Ali in a drowning accident, and long serving opening batsman Michael Carberry being diagnosed with a cancerous lung tumour, saw Hampshire suffer a poor season, being knocked out in the group stages of both the Natwest t20 Blast, where they missed out on Finals Day for the first time since 2009, and the Royal London One-Day Cup. Their championship season was much the same as in 2015, again making a slow start, but they gave themselves too much to do and were relegated back to Division Two after defeat against Durham on 23 September 2016. However, on 3 October 2016 Hampshire were given a reprieve as Durham were relegated to Division Two after taking up a financial package from the ECB to help with their finances, with their relegation and a points deduction being the fine for taking this agreement. Coach Dale Benkenstein departed as coach for 'Personal Reasons' in mid-July and was replaced by Craig White originally in a caretaker role, before taking over as full-time first team coach in November. At the end of the season, long serving seamer James Tomlinson retired having been with Hampshire since 2002 and making over 150 appearances in all formats for Hampshire. The Winter of 2017 saw Hampshire draw criticism over the signings of Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw on Kolpak deals, with these players giving up international cricket to represent Hampshire. On the field Hampshire again had a mixed season in first class cricket, avoiding relegation for the 3rd season in a row by drawing against already relegated Warwickshire meaning relegation for Middlesex, with Kolpak Abbott taking 60 wickets across the First-class season. In List A cricket Hampshire again missed out on the knockout stages. However Hampshire performed better in Twenty20 cricket, qualifying for their 7th Finals Day in 8 years, although they lost in the Semi-final to eventual winners Nottinghamshire. They also recorded their highest Twenty20 score in their Quarter final victory over Derbyshire scoring 249\u20138, with Pakistan overseas player Shahid Afridi scoring a century.", "|style=\"text-align:center\"|25|| Chris Wood* ||  ||  || Right-handed || Left-arm fast-medium || White ball contract"]}, {"page": "Amery Hill School", "response": ["*Chris Wood Cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wood", "response": ["*Chris Wood (disambiguation), several people", ":* Chris Wood (actor) (born 1988), American actor", ":* Chris Wood (cricketer) (born 1990), English Cricketer", ":*Chris Wood (CIA), Counterterrorism officer of the CIA who hunted Osama Bin Laden", ":* Chris Wood (diplomat) (born 1959), British diplomat", ":* Chris Wood (folk musician), English folk singer and musician", ":* Chris Wood (footballer, born 1955), English footballer who played for Huddersfield Town", ":* Chris Wood (footballer, born 1987), English footballer who formerly played for Mansfield town, now Worksop Town", ":* Chris Wood (footballer, born 1991), Burnley and New Zealand international footballer", ":* Chris Wood (golfer) (born 1987), British golfer", ":* Chris Wood (jazz musician) (born 1969), bassist with the trio Medeski Martin & Wood", ":* Chris Wood (rock musician) (1944\u20131983), saxophonist, flautist with the rock band Traffic"]}, {"page": "Chris Wood", "response": ["Chris Wood may refer to:", "* Chris Wood (jazz musician) (born 1969), jazz bassist with the trio Medeski Martin & Wood", "* Chris Wood (rock musician) (1944\u20131983), saxophonist, flautist with the rock band Traffic", "* Chris Wood (folk musician), English folk singer and musician", "* Chris Wood (footballer, born 1955), English footballer who played for Huddersfield Town", "* Chris Wood (footballer, born 1987), English footballer who formerly played for Mansfield Town, now Worksop Town", "* Chris Wood (footballer, born 1991), Newcastle United and New Zealand international footballer", "* Chris Wood (golfer) (born 1987), English golfer", "* Chris Wood (cricketer) (born 1990), English cricketer", "* Chris Wood (actor) (born 1988), American actor", "* Chris Wood (diplomat) (born 1959), British diplomat", "*Chris Wood (CIA), Officer of the Central Intelligence Agency who once led the hunt for Osama Bin Laden", "*Chris Woods (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Michael Bates (English cricketer)", "response": ["Bates made his first-class debut for Hampshire against Oxford University at University Parks, Oxford in 2010.
