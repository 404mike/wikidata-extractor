He returned to Cliftonville in September 2019, before signing for Warrenpoint Town, also of the NIFL Premiership, in February 2020.

He has also represented Northern Ireland at under-17 and under-19 level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darren Sarll", "response": ["The 2016\u201317 season proved to be one of inconsistency, despite an undefeated run of eight wins in 9 matches establishing the club in the playoff zone by March 2017. 16 points from six matches in February won Sarll the League Two Manager of the Month award. Any promotion hopes were extinguished with a winless run in the final six matches of the season and the club finished in 10th place. During the season, Sarll oversaw the transition of Dale Gorman, Jamie Gray, Mark McKee and Luke Wade-Slater from the academy set-up into the first-team. The 2017\u201318 season began with wins in six of the opening 11 matches, before the inconsistency of the previous seasons set in. Despite strengthening the squad with a number of new signings in January 2018, a run of just four wins from 26 league matches between October 2017 and March 2018 led to Sarll's sacking on 18 March 2018."]}, {"page": "McKee, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark McKee"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2019 || CM ||  || Mark McKee ||  Cliftonville || Released || "]}]}}
