Undeterred, Rainier sailed into Batavia roadstead and there discovered a number of small warships and the frigate Maria Riggersbergen. The smaller ships drove themselves on shore rather than fight the larger British vessel, but Captain Claas Jager on Maria Riggersbergen engaged Caroline. In a battle lasting 30 minutes, the Dutch ship was defeated and captured, Rainier sending the prisoners on shore and removing the frigate, which was later renamed HMS Java.James, Vol. 4, p. 267", "The success of the campaign against the Dutch squadron in the East Indies allowed British forces in the Indian Ocean to focus exclusively on the French islands of \u00cele Bonaparte and Isle de France, which proved very difficult to subdue during the ensuing Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811.Gardiner, p. 95 Freedom of movement for British forces in the East Indies proved invaluable however: on 27 January 1807, Peter Rainier in Caroline had seized a Spanish ship San Raphael carrying over half a million Spanish dollars and an exceptionally valuable cargo, and the ability of British commerce raiders to act against French, Spanish and Dutch merchant shipping in the region was assured. When Pellew's successor Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury attempted to eliminate the Dutch East Indies islands in a series of large scale invasions during 1810, the Spice Islands were captured and in 1811 Java was seized. British naval movements were completely unopposed, allowing a rapid and successful conclusion to the war in the Pacific.Gardiner, p. 110"]}, {"page": "HMS Diomede (1781)", "response": ["On 23 July Diomede joined a squadron under Commodore Peter Rainier consisting of , , Centurion, with troop transports, and sailed for Ceylon to take Trincomalee and other Dutch settlements on the island."]}, {"page": "HMS Admiral Rainier (1800)", "response": ["HMS Admiral Rainier was a Dutch 16-gun brig that the British captured on 23 August 1800 at Kuyper's Island, Java. They took her into service and named her after Admiral Peter Rainier, the leader of the British expedition. After the British sold her in 1803 apparently the French captured her in 1804 and sold her to the Dutch colonial government in Batavia for anti-piracy patrol. Her Javanese crew mutinied in 1806 and eventually sailed to Penang where vessels of the British East India Company (EIC) seized the vessel. She returned to British service, only to be captured and recaptured by vessels of the EIC.

On their way as they were passing through the Straits of Banca, on 22 January they sighted a strange sail. Lieutenant William Hugh Dobbie, fifth lieutenant of Suffolk took her launch to investigate. When it became obvious that the vessel was a becalmed Dutch naval brig, Suffolks boats joined him. Towards early evening, a breeze came up, which enabled the brig to make sail. Dobbie and the boats gave chase, firing their swivel guns as their quarry fired at them. Eventually, Orpheus came up and at 2am captured the brig at 2am. She was the Harlingen, of 14 guns and 45 men. Rainier put Dobbie in command of Harlingen.", "Lieutenant Robert Sheldrake took command of Amboyna in April 1800. In September 1800 Vice-Admiral Peter Rainier received the Admiralty's permission to mount an expedition against Java, in particular to blockade Batavia. On 28 September, on the eve of his departure, he allocated his naval forces. Amboyna was at Bombay with the rest of Rear-Admiral Blankett's squadron."]}, {"page": "John Halsted", "response": ["The French Revolutionary Wars having broken out by now, Suffolk was ordered to the East Indies under Captain Peter Rainier, where Rainier was to take command of the East Indies Station. Halsted was active in operations against French colonies in the East Indies, and Rainier placed him in charge of 100 sailors during shore operations at Ceylon and the Maluku Islands. He returned with the troops to Madras in March 1797 and was appointed to his first command, the sloop . Halsted was only briefly in command in an acting capacity, and at Rainier's request he left the ship to take charge of the newly established naval hospital at Madras, having impressed Rainier with his measures while in charge of the sick returning from the expedition to Amboyna.  He was then ordered to join the expedition against Manila, travelling to Calcutta to take command of the bomb vessel  in July. The expedition was cancelled before it left India, and November 1797 Halsted received a new commission, to take over the 32-gun  from Captain John Murray, Murray having been ordered by the Admiralty to take command of the 36-gun . Crescent was based at the Cape of Good Hope Station, but Murray had affairs to settle in India. Rainier therefore asked Halsted to exchange with Murray and instead sail to take over Crescent on the Cape Station, and at the same time carry despatches to be forwarded back to Britain from there."]}]}}
