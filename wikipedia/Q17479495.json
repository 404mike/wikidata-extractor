Despite having beaten Paso twice in earlier meetings, Edwards suffered a technical knockout in the fourth round, resulting in his first back-to-back losses of his professional career. Matters worsened in February 1961 when he fought John \"Cowboy\" McCormack, who had briefly held the British middleweight title in 1959. The match was an eliminator for another shot at the middleweight title and after the fight went the full distance, McCormack was given the decision. Edwards fought twice more in 1961, beating American Neal Rivers and Londoner Pat O'Grady. The next year was Edward's final year as a professional. He started well beating his first three opponents by points, but on 24 September he faced George Aldridge at Granby Halls in Leicester for another eliminator for the British title. The fight went the distance, but again Edwards came up short losing the decision. This was Edwards' last professional fight."]}, {"page": "George Aldridge", "response": ["George Aldridge may refer to:", "* George Aldridge (boxer) (born 1936), British middleweight boxer"]}]}}
