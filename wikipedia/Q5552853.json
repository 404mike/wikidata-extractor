Following the departure of Jamie Vermiglio to Scarborough, Clark was made captain for the 2006\u201307 season. A poor start to the season which saw Chorley joint bottom of the league with no points and only one goal to show for the first four games, manager Shaun Teale was replaced by a former teammate of Clark's, Paul Lodge, with Clark becoming player-coach. Lodge's time at Chorley was short lived and after less than two months in the role resigned which saw Clark applying for the job and becoming caretaker manager for the interim. Clark missed out on getting the role full-time as it was given to Gerry Luczka instead, however he was later awarded the Players' Player of the Year award for the second successive season and KC Couriers' Player of the Year."]}]}}
