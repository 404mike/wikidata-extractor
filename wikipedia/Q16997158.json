The mine, known as the 'W' Bomb, was designed by Millis Jefferis, who had received the request for the device on 10 November and had completed the first demonstration model by 24 November. A delayed-action fuze based on a soluble chemical pellet was devised by Jefferis' assistant, Stuart Macrae, using an Alka-Seltzer tablet, which was found to dissolve at a predictable rate. Each mine contained  of Trinitrotoluene (TNT). Trials of the mines were carried out in the Thames in December 1939 and depending upon type, either floated or bounced along the riverbed. Because Jefferis' department only consisted of three people at the point, the trials had to be conducted with the help of a boat crewed by local Sea Scouts, who followed the mines after they had been dropped from Chiswick Bridge. Over 20,000 'W' Bombs were produced in the course of the war."]}, {"page": "Sticky bomb", "response": ["Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives which added stability to the mixture and gave it a squash-head-like effect, where the explosive deformed and spread out on the target before exploding. The detonation would be concentrated on a small area, rupturing a thicker armour plate than a more diffuse explosion. The charge was covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.", "Under the circumstances, Jefferis considered that his idea might have more general application for the British Army and the Home Guard. Jefferis was in charge of a department known as , which had been created to develop and deliver weapons for use by guerrilla and resistance groups in occupied Europe.  was now charged with the development of the sticky bomb.
