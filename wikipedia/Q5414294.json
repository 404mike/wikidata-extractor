When the report was brought up in parliament in 1853, Lord Monteagle argued against the implementation of open examinations because it was a Chinese system and China was not an \"enlightened country.\" Lord Stanley called the examinations the \"Chinese Principle.\" The Earl of Granville did not deny this but argued in favor of the examination system, considering that the minority Manchus had been able to rule China with it for over 200 years. In 1854, Edwin Chadwick reported that some noblemen did not agree with the measures introduced because they were Chinese. The examination system was finally implemented in the British Indian Civil Service in 1855, prior to which admission into the civil service was purely a matter of patronage, and in England in 1870. Even as late as ten years after the competitive examination plan was passed, people still attacked it as an \"adopted Chinese culture.\" Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington insisted that the English \"did not know that it was necessary for them to take lessons from the Celestial Empire.\" In 1875, Archibald Sayce voiced concern over the prevalence of competitive examinations, which he described as \"the invasion of this new Chinese culture.\""]}, {"page": "Suicide note", "response": ["* Eustace Budgell (1737)\u2014English writer: \"What Cato did, and Addison approved, cannot be wrong.\" Joseph Addison was Budgell's cousin."]}, {"page": "The Spectator (1711)", "response": ["The Spectator was a daily publication founded by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele in England, lasting from 1711 to 1712.
