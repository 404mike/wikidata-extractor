He started his career in Canadian film and television projects, where his portrayal of Stanley Raymond Kowalski on the television series Due South was his first international success. After years acting in over 125 Canadian and international projects, he became widely known for his portrayal of Leoben Conoy on Battlestar Galactica, and following that, his role as record producer Lew Ashby on the Showtime series Californication. Frequently cast as a bad guy in movies (and more often in numerous guest appearances on American television series), Rennie's regular participation in Canadian productions gives him an opportunity to show a broader range of his acting abilities, which have been recognized by several awards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 14", "response": ["*  1960   \u2013 Callum Keith Rennie, English-Canadian actor and producer"]}, {"page": "1960", "response": ["** Callum Keith Rennie, Canadian actor"]}, {"page": "Helena Bonham Carter", "response": ["On 17 May 2012, it was announced that Bonham Carter would be appearing in the 2013 adaptation of Reif Larsen's book The Selected Works of T.S.
