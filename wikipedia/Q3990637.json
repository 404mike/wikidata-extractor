Burton, 56, plays a Toronto artist whose muse and passion are revived by a liaison with Tatum O\u2019Neal, 18, a schoolgirl who wants to be a writer. The premise is within reason, if barely. It\u2019s harder to accept the obnoxious supporting characters\u2014her parents and friends, his art world associates\u2014and the actors who play them quite badly. Jules (Never on Sunday) Dassin\u2019s direction and Thomas Hedley\u2019s script are strained too. At one point O\u2019Neal goes on a hunger strike when her parents won\u2019t let her see Burton. \u201cThat old gentleman happens to mean more to me than anything else,\u201d she wails. \u201cThe next time I eat, it will be with him.\u201d While she\u2019s a decent actress, O\u2019Neal hardly seems attractive enough for the role, even though she records her first nude scene. Burton, meanwhile, gentlemanly underacts, yet his glances and monosyllables are so much more interesting than the rest of the movie they become a form of upstaging."]}, {"page": "Hedley (surname)", "response": ["* Thomas Hedley (born 1942/43), publisher"]}, {"page": "Hedley, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Hedley"]}, {"page": "Thomas Hedley (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Thomas Hedley  (born 1942/43), British magazine editor and screenwriter", "* Thomas Hedley Reynolds (1920\u20132009), American historian", "*Thomas Hedley Co., former British soap and candles company "]}]}}
