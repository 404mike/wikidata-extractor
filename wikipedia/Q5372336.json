In the landmark paper Rayfield et al. (2001), the skull of the theropod dinosaur Allosaurus was analysed using FEA in order to quantitatively assess different feeding hypotheses. This paper was the first use of FEA on a three-dimensional structure in palaeontology (in collaboration with CT scanning), and spurred the current trend of CT-scanned skull FEA on feeding biomechanics in zoology and palaeontology.In addition, she helped elucidate the cranial biomechanics of the noted carnivorous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus using two-dimensional FEA. This study was expanded upon in a comparative finite element analysis of 2D theropod skulls (namely Allosaurus Coelophysis and Tyrannosaurus), in order to quantitatively compare cranial biomechanics.Prof. Rayfield was President of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology from 2018 to 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Society of Vertebrate Paleontology", "response": ["SVP was founded as an independent society in 1940 by a group of scientists who had formed the 'section of vertebrate paleontology' in the Paleontological Society six years earlier.  Among the founding members were George Gaylord Simpson, who was nine years later also a founding member of the Society for the Study of Evolution, and Alfred Sherwood Romer.  SVP's members wanted to maintain a strong focus on evolution and zoology at a time when the Paleontological Society was becoming increasingly biostratigraphic and industry focused. SVP's first president was Al Romer (served 1940-41), and its current president is Jessica Theodor.  Six out of the last eight of SVP's presidents have been women (Annalisa Berta, Catherine E. Badgley, Blaire Van Valkenburgh, Catherine Forster, Emily Rayfield, and Jessica Theodor), as is the president-elect (Margaret Lewis)."]}, {"page": "Palaeontological Association", "response": ["| Emily Rayfield"]}, {"page": "Rayfield", "response": ["* Emily Rayfield, British palaeontologist"]}, {"page": "Emily rayfield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Emily Rayfield "]}, {"page": "List of paleontologists", "response": ["* Emily Rayfield (England)"]}, {"page": "TrowelBlazers", "response": ["* Emily Rayfield"]}]}}
