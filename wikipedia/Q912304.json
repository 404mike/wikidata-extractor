Both turned the band down so Rhys sang the verses through a vocoder to imitate another person, something which he has described as a \"very schizophrenic thing to do\". Rhys has claimed his lyrics address social injustice and are about \"house prices going up, and people being left behind by the super rich\". The song has echoes of the Philadelphia soul music of the 1970s as well as David Bowie's \"plastic\" approximation of the sound on his 1975 album Young Americans. The group tried to make the song as \"plastic\" as possible: \"if we'd tried to make it sound authentic, it would have been awful.\" According to Rhys the band were keen to challenge people's opinions of them with the track which is a \"shocking song, because you can't shock with loud guitars any more\" and, as a polished uplifting pop song, is \"fairly subversive\" when contrasted with the macho guitar music which the band felt was prevalent in 2001.
