He was loaned out to Conference North sides Lancaster City and Stafford Rangers in 2005\u201306, before he spent 2006\u201307 on loan at Barrow, also of the Conference North. He established himself in the Crewe first team picture in 2007\u201308, before becoming the club's top scorer in 2008\u201309 with ten League One goals. He became Rotherham United's joint-record signing when he made a \u00a3150,000 move to the Yorkshire club in June 2009.

He was voted Port Vale's Player of the Year in 2013 and 2014. He signed with Bury in June 2015, and remained with the club for two seasons before rejoining Port Vale. He claimed the club's Player of the Year award for a record third time in 2018 and the following year he became the second highest goalscorer in the club's history.

According to manager Graham Turner, the player seemed reluctant initially to play in the fourth tier of English football but was won over by the club's ambition. Sadler made his Shrewsbury Town debut in the opening game of the season, in a 3 \u2013 1 win over Bradford City. In the next game, Sadler played a role for the club when he provided assist for Matt Harrold to score the only goal in the game in a 1\u20130 win over Macclesfield Town. Since then, Sadler made an impressive display at Shrewsbury Town, having established himself in the first team and expressed interests of extending his loan spell at the club for the remainder of the season. On 6 January 2011 saw Sadler's loan spell at Shrewsbury Town extended until the end of the season. During the match against Port Vale on 8 March 2011, Sadler controversially fouled Tom Pope in a penalty box, leading to a penalty kick converted successfully, which resulted a 2\u20132 draw. Despite this, Sadler went on to be an ever-present player in the League Two season to play every minute of every game for his club.

However Hughes later revealed that Adams was against the transfer but had been overruled by chairman Norman Smurthwaite. He marked his debut against the \"Gills\" with the winning goal that sent Vale to the top of the table. Being partnered with the country's leading goalscorer Tom Pope allowed Hughes space in front of goal vacated by opposition defenders attempting to double up on Pope. Hughes scored his first hat-trick for the \"Valiants\" in a 7\u20131 home victory over Burton Albion on 5 April, with two of his goals coming from the penalty spot as he took over from Jennison Myrie-Williams as the club's penalty taker.

However, Paul Simpson's dismissal at Stockport County led to hopes of a return to the club for some County fans. Therefore, he was installed as the bookies favourite to become the next Port Vale manager, and also the bookie's favourite for the Stockport job. Gannon was confirmed as the manager of Port Vale on 6 January 2011, succeeding Micky Adams at the helm of the promotion chasing club, signing a contract that lasted until summer 2012. Saying that finishing outside of the top seven would be a failure, the Cheshire-based manager's first task after 'burying the hatchet' with Gareth Owen was to look for a new striker. Two weeks into his reign club captain Tommy Fraser left the club by mutual consent, as signs of what would be an unhappy relationship between club and manager quickly came to the surface. Gannon then brought in Romaine Sawyers and Kayleden Brown on loan from West Bromwich Albion, Jay O'Shea on loan from Birmingham City, Exodus Geohaghon on loan from Peterborough United, and striker Tom Pope on loan from Rotherham United.", "Results continued to go against the Vale though, as on 19 March they lost 3\u20130 at Accrington Stanley, and as a result dropped out of the play-off zone for the first time in the season. Ugly post-match scenes at the Crown Ground saw Geohaghon confront fans who singled him out for abuse, whilst Gannon was ushered quietly out of the back door. Roberts told the media \"I don't think the manager likes me and, to be honest, I don't like him\". Rumours circulated that Gannon would soon be on his way out. These rumours were proved accurate two days later, as Gannon's departure was confirmed by the club. Hugely unpopular with Vale supporters, his sacking was \"quick and with little emotion\", whilst his poor man-management skills helped to earn him the dubious honour of having the shortest reign in the club's history. Despite this he did receive credit for spotting the potential talent in a teenage Sam Morsy, and for bringing Tom Pope to the club. Gannon himself made a statement on his website declaring his disappointment in the club's decision to terminate his contract after such a short period of time, and also bemoaned that he \"wasn't able to add many new players [to the squad]\".

Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe. Days before the start of the season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion, and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope, also a free transfer signing. After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals \u2013 both scoring and conceding \u2013 Adams decided to give his players \"a kick up the backside\" by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers (on loan) and Rob Kozluk.

He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons.
