She was married to fellow player George Greville.\nAustin was born in Wales to Rev. Edward and Elizabeth Austin. They moved to Broadhempston, Devon, where her father was the vicar, and Rendlesham, Suffolk, where her father was the rector.Between 1893 and 1919, she participated 16 times in the single event of the Wimbledon Championships and achieved her best result in 1894 and 1896 when she reached the final of the all-comers tournament. In 1894 she lost to Blanche Hillyard in straight sets, winning just two games and Hillyard became champions as the title holder Lottie Dod did not defend her title. In 1896 she lost the all-comers final in three sets to Alice Pickering. In her last two Wimbledon appearances in 1913 and 1919 she also played in the doubles and mixed doubles events.\nShe won the singles title at the Kent Championships on six occasions (1894-97, 1899, 1900).In 1894, she defeated May Arbuthnot in a three-set final to win the singles title of the British Covered Court Championships, played on wood courts at the Queen's Club in London.
