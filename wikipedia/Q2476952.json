Anthony Burgess, William York Tindall, and Philip Kitcher. While no two summaries interpret the plot in the same way, there are a number of central \"plot points\" upon which they find general agreement. A number of Joyce scholars question the legitimacy of searching for a linear storyline within the complex text.Levitt, M. P., ed., Joyce and the Joyceans (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2002), p. 165. As Bernard Benstock highlights, \"in a work where every sentence opens a variety of possible interpretations, any synopsis of a chapter is bound to be incomplete.\"Benstock 1965, p.6.  David Hayman has suggested that \"For all the efforts made by critics to establish a plot for the Wake, it makes little sense to force this prose into a narrative mold.\"Hayman, David. The \"Wake\" in Transit, p.41, footnote 1 The book's challenges have led some commentators into generalised statements about its content and themes, prompting critic Bernard Benstock to warn against the danger of \"boiling down\" Finnegans Wake into \"insipid pap, and leaving the lazy reader with a predigested mess of generalizations and catchphrases.\"Benstock 1965, p.4. Fritz Senn has also voiced concerns with some plot synopses, saying \"we have some traditional summaries, also some put in circulation by Joyce himself. I find them most unsatisfactory and unhelpful, they usually leave out the hard parts and recirculate what we already think we know. I simply cannot believe that FW would be as blandly uninteresting as those summaries suggest.\""]}, {"page": "2001 in film", "response": ["| The Tailor of Panama || Columbia Pictures || John Boorman (director/screenplay); Andrew Davies, John le Carr\u00e9 (screenplay); Pierce Brosnan, Geoffrey Rush, Jamie Lee Curtis, Leonor Varela, Brendan Gleeson, Harold Pinter, Catherine McCormack, Daniel Radcliffe, Martin Ferrero, David Hayman, Mark Margolis, John Fortune, Jon Polito, Dylan Baker, Jonathan Hyde, Lisa Dwan, Lola Boorman, Douglas Waters || Thriller || Live action"]}, {"page": "2000 in film", "response": ["| Vertical Limit || Columbia Pictures || Martin Campbell (director); Robert King, Terry Hayes (screenplay); Chris O'Donnell, Bill Paxton, Robin Tunney, Scott Glenn, Izabella Scorupco, Temuera Morrison, Stuart Wilson, Robert Taylor, Nicholas Lea, Alexander Siddig, David Hayman, Ben Mendelsohn, Steve Le Marquand, Roshan Seth, Ed Viesturs || Action, Thriller || Live action"]}, {"page": "1995 in film", "response": ["| Rob Roy || United Artists || Michael Caton-Jones (director); Alan Sharp (screenplay); Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir, Brian Cox, Brian McCardie, Gilbert Martin, Jason Flemyng, Ewan Stewart, David Hayman, Shirley Henderson || Adventure || Live action"]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| Smilla's Sense of Snow || Fox Searchlight Pictures || Bille August (director); Ann Biderman (screenplay); Julia Ormond, Gabriel Byrne, Richard Harris, Robert Loggia, Vanessa Redgrave, Jim Broadbent, Tom Wilkinson, Bob Peck, David Hayman, Peter Capaldi, Mario Adorf, Erik Holmey, Matthew Marsh, J\u00fcrgen Vogel, Charlotte Bradley || Mystery, Thriller || Live action", "| The Jackal || Universal Pictures / Mutual Film Company / Alphaville Films || Michael Caton-Jones (director); Chuck Pfarrer (screenplay); Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier, Diane Venora, Mathilda May, J.
