The author of over 140 novels and 230 short stories and novellas, Tubb is best known for The Dumarest Saga (US collective title: Dumarest of Terra), an epic science-fiction saga set in the far future. Michael Moorcock wrote, \"His reputation for fast-moving and colourful SF writing is unmatched by anyone in Britain.\"Much of Tubb's work was written under pseudonyms including Gregory Kern, Carl Maddox, Alan Guthrie, Eric Storm and George Holt. He used 58 pen names over five decades of writing, although some of these were publishers' house names also used by other writers: Volsted Gridban (along with John Russell Fearn), Gill Hunt (with John Brunner and Dennis Hughes), King Lang (with George Hay and John W Jennison), Roy Sheldon (with H. J. Campbell) and Brian Shaw. Tubb's Charles Grey alias was solely his own and acquired a big following in the early 1950s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Traveller (role-playing game)", "response": ["* Dumarest of Terra saga, Edwin Charles Tubb, 1967-2008"]}, {"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*Edwin Charles Tubb (1919\u20132010)"]}, {"page": "Charles Grey", "response": ["*Edwin Charles Tubb (1919\u20132010), British writer who used Charles Grey as a pseudonym"]}, {"page": "Eurocon", "response": ["United Kingdom - Lucifer, Edwin Charles Tubb;"]}, {"page": "E C Tubb", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edwin Charles Tubb"]}, {"page": "E.
