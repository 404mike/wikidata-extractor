The words were written by his brother George Henry Powell (under the pseudonym George Asaf), and the song was entered into a competition for \"best morale-building song\". It won first prize and was noted as \"perhaps the most optimistic song ever written\".Powell later wrote a musical play, Rubicund Castle, which was staged at the Pavilion Theatre in Peacehaven. When a West End producer bought it he drastically altered it, leaving only the music unchanged, and renamed it Primrose Times. This version went unstaged after the latter was arrested and convicted for fraud.Powell committed suicide during World War II in 1942, aged 63.

Cunningham, Leisure in the Industrial Revolution c. 1780-c. 1880 (London: Taylor and Francis, 1980), pp. 164-70. The new urban communities, cut off from their cultural roots, required new and accessible means of entertainment. Music halls were originally bars, which provided entertainment in the form of music and speciality acts for their patrons. By the middle years of the 19th century, the first purpose-built music halls were being built in London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that could no longer be met from the traditional folk repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap. By the turn of the century, music hall was dominated by song writing companies and theatre chains, such as that of Sir Oswald Stoll.M. R. Booth and J. H. Kaplan, ed., The Edwardian Theatre Essays on Performance and the Stage (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 62.  Music hall songs are characterised by a simple beat and a strong melody or tune, which can be easily acquired by the audience. Typically, a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone and a repeated chorus, which carries the principal melody and in which the audience is encouraged to join. Leading music hall stars included: Marie Lloyd, Harry Champion, George Formby, Vesta Tilley, Gus Elen, Little Tich, Gracie Fields and Flanagan and Allen. Musical hall composers included Lionel Monckton, Felix Powell and Noel Gay."]}, {"page": "It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown", "response": ["#\"Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag\" (Felix Powell, George Asaf)"]}, {"page": "Cavalcade (1933 film)", "response": ["* \"Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag and Smile, Smile, Smile\" by Felix Powell and George Asaf"]}, {"page": "Snoo Wilson", "response": ["A departure from Wilson's usual theatrical genres was in 1986, when he wrote a new libretto for Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld for the English National Opera. The reviews concentrated on the production designs, which strongly divided opinion; Wilson's work escaped the sharp censure directed at his colleagues, and his device of turning the bossy character \"Public Opinion\" into a parody of the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was favourably remarked upon.Griffiths, Paul. \"Flamboyant underworld of a cartoonist's vision \u2013 Orpheus in the Underworld\", The Times, 11 September 1985, p. 15; and Heyworth, Peter. \"Orpheus in the Undergrowth, The Observer, 15 September 1985, p. 21 Wilson's only play to have a production in the West End was HRH, concerning the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in exile. His television movies included Shadey, an ESP-themed piece for Channel 4 (1986) and Eichmann, about the interrogation of the eponymous character (2007). Two musicals, aimed at youth theatre, were Bedbug: The Musical, an adaptation of the 1929 play by Vladimir Mayakovsky, and a musical about the short and dramatic life of soldier-composer Felix Powell.  Sabina (1998) \"remains the best drama about Carl Jung's relationship with a young female mental patient, and later his student, Sabina Spielrein\".
