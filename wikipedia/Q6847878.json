The house had also been redecorated in more muted colours, echoing the ill-fated 1996 revamp. The programme moved to a line up of three main presenters, Paul Tonkinson, Amanda Byram and Donna Air. However, Tonkinson was dropped from the programme at the end of March 2001 and Air left not long after. Richard Bacon and Amanda Byram remained as main presenters, the programme having reverted to two main presenters once more. The living room, which had been repainted a dark red as part of the revamp, was changed to a bright yellow and pink design, while the main presenter chairs were also reinstalled in front of the living room's French windows. They replaced the bright green sofa which had also been brought in as part of the revamp. The new logo was replaced with one more closely resembling the traditional Big Breakfast logo, albeit utilising a slightly different font. Mike McClean was given a role on the programme, as Down Your Doorstep presenter and cover for Bacon, most regularly on Fridays when Bacon would reprise his former Down Your Doorstep role alongside Johnny Vegas.", "Mark Lamarr, Keith Chegwin, Paul Ross, Richard Orford, Richard Bacon and Mike McClean were \"down your doorstep\" outside broadcasters, often turning up live and unannounced at an unsuspecting viewer's house, while rooms within the Lock Keeper's Houses featured the puppets Zig and Zag and video games guru Ben the Boffin.", "* Mike McClean (2000\u201302)"]}, {"page": "Howard Brown (Halifax Bank)", "response": ["In 2003, he had a role in The Office Christmas special, playing himself alongside Ricky Gervais as David Brent and Paul \"Bubble\" Ferguson from Big Brother 2.

Brown and Bubble were getting on much better with the female contestant than Brent, much to his dissatisfaction. When Brown sat down, McClean shouted at the audience \"Who gives you extra?\" to which they replied \"Who Who Who?\". This is a reference to the Halifax advert which sings \"Who gives you extra?\" to the tune of \"Who Let the Dogs Out?\" by the Baha Men.
