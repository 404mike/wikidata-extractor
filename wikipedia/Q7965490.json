He built up a herd of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cattle.\nIn 1953 Loveys was made Chairman of Chichester Conservative Association, and elected to West Sussex County Council. On the council he chaired the Agricultural Education Committee. When Lancelot Joynson-Hicks, MP for Chichester, inherited a peerage in 1958, Loveys was selected from 71 applicants to fight the byelection to replace him. The selection was somewhat controversial and some members of the Conservative Association were reported to be looking for an independent candidate to support instead, but such a candidate could not be found and Loveys duly won the seat.\nIn Parliament Loveys was not a prominent member. He was Honorary Secretary of the House of Commons Motor Club, and also had his farming experience acknowledged in the horticulture sub-committee of the Conservative private members' committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. He had already announced his retirement when he died suddenly at his home in March 1969.", "link_mentions": {}}}
