Initiated by Ron Tauranac, designed by Geoff Ferris, and built by a team including Nick Goozee (monocoque) and Bob Paton (construction), it was one of the last cars produced by MRD before MRD was closed by the then new Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone. Based on the Formula Two Brabham BT40 (which was also designed by Geoff Ferris) the BT43 featured a modified monocoque that incorporated the triangular cross section pioneered by the Brabham BT42 Formula One car which was designed by Gordon Murray. This distinctive pyramid shape not only kept the aerodynamic \"stagnation point\" low but also neatly allowed the incorporation of a \"crushable structure\" as required by the 1973 regulations which specified that all fuel tanks were to be protected by deformable structures. Engine and gearbox were the then de facto F5000 standard combination of a Chevrolet 302 cubic inch engine in an unstressed mounting and a Hewland DG300 gearbox. The fitment of these into what was a relatively small Formula Two sized car presented some design challenges. Front suspension components were BT40 while rear suspension components were a combination of Formula One and BT40."]}, {"page": "Geoff Ferris (motorsport)", "response": ["Geoff Ferris (born 2 August 1936) is a British racing car designer who has designed open-wheel racing cars for Penske Racing (Formula One and CART), Lotus (Formula One), Brabham (Formula 2, Formula Atlantic/B, Formula 3, and F5000)."]}]}}
