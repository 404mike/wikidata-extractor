In 1899 Strobell's name started to appear as a coauthor of Foot's papers. Foot and Strobell were among the first to photograph the development stages of fertilized eggs and together researched the role of chromosomes in hereditary, sex-linked characteristics. Additionally, they developed a technique for creating samples at low temperatures for viewing under the microscope. This was a significant technical advance of the time. Between 1906 and 1913 the two researched certain stages of chromosomal development of squash bugs. This was believed to be done in a Laboratory of their own in New York City. Foot and Strobell participated in debates on the role of chromosomes in transmitting definite units of hereditary information such as sex-linked characteristics. They defended their position against T.H. Morgan. In 1914 Foot and Strobell went to England to continue their research under Harry Eltringham of New College Oxford. Their research stopped in 1917 when Strobell became ill."]}, {"page": "Ella Church Strobell", "response": ["In 1914, the pair went to England and worked with entomologist Harry Eltringham of New College Oxford to continue work on the crossbreeding of Hemiptera."]}]}}
