In his later years he was popular for his occasional radio broadcasts. Among his best-known works is his only novel, Zuleika Dobson, published in 1911.

He was particularly praised for his vivid characters with eccentric and idiosyncratic and habits, including Fagin, Falstaff and Svengali.  His diligent preparation and attention to detail in make-up, gesture, body position and facial expression allowed him to inhabit these roles.  He used his expressive eyes to project such varied emotions as \"the dreamy languor of Hamlet during his moments of reflection and the baleful hatred of Shylock towards his persecutors to the nervous fear of Richard II during his surrender at Flint Castle.  His Malvolio was a swaggering and conceited fool, King John a superstitious and deceitful coward, and Macbeth a neurotic and self-torturing monarch.\" The literary critic Desmond MacCarthy wrote of Tree: \"He could make himself look like Falstaff. He understood and revelled in the character of Falstaff, but his performance lacked fundamental force.
