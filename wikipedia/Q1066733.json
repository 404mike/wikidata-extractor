Wright's diminutive stature \u2013 he was only 4 feet 11 inches (1.50 m) tall \u2013 and Northern Irish accent became assets to the comedy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Irish people", "response": ["* Jackie Wright"]}, {"page": "Benny Hill", "response": ["Hill had struggled on stage and had uneven success in radio, but in television he found a medium that played to his strengths. The Benny Hill Show had a music hall-derived format combining live on-stage comedy and filmed segments, and its humour relied on slapstick, innuendo and parody. Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included Patricia Hayes, Jeremy Hawk, Peter Vernon, Ronnie Brody and his co-writer from the early 1950s to early 1960s, Dave Freeman. Short, bald Jackie Wright was a frequent supporting player who in many sketches had to put up with Hill slapping him on the top of his head.", "From the start of the 1980s, the show featured a troupe of attractive young women, known collectively as \"Hill's Angels\". They would appear either on their own in a dance sequence or in character as foils against Hill. Sue Upton was one of the longest-serving members of the Angels. Jane Leeves appeared, as well. Henry McGee and Bob Todd joined Jackie Wright as comic supporting players, and the later shows also featured \"Hill's Little Angels\", a group of cute children including the families of Dennis Kirkland (the show's director) and Sue Upton. Jenny Lee-Wright (who first appeared on Hill's show in 1970) earned the nickname 'The Sexiest Stooge' \u2013 coined by Hill.", "Radio and TV host Adam Carolla claimed that he was a fan of Hill and that he considered Hill \"as American as The Beatles\". During an episode of The Man Show, Carolla performed in what was billed as a tribute to \"our favourite Englishman, Sir Benny Hill\" (Hill was never knighted) in more risqu\u00e9 versions of some of the sketches. Carolla played a rude and lecherous waiter, a typical Hill role, and the sketch featured many of the staples of Hill's shows, including a Jackie Wright-esque bald man, as well as the usual scantily clad women."]}, {"page": "Mastermind (British game show)", "response": ["Benny Hill parodied Mastermind on The Benny Hill Show on at least two occasions.
