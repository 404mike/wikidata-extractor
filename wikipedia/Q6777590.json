A subsequent band included Peter Knight, later of Steeleye Span.\nAdelman was at Barnet College of Further Education with Peter Banks (later of Yes). Adelman later joined The Selfs, including Chris Squire (also later of Yes), and when The Selfs merged with The Syn, Adelman joined Squire and Selfs keyboardist Andrew Jackman in the new band. The Syn played Tamla motown, blues and soul. Adelman subsequently left the band. However, he did later help Banks get the post of new guitarist in The Syn.\nAdelman later took up photography and an early assignment included pictures for Yes' Close to the Edge album. During the 1980s, he did black-and-white portrait work for The Face and Blitz magazine.\nIn late 2003, Adelman met again Steve Nardelli and Peter Banks and he drummed in a reunion of The Syn in 2004, material appearing on the release Original Syn.

Dean gained inspiration for the artwork during a visit to Haystacks, a tall hill in the Lake District. He took a photograph at its summit and observing the many tarns surrounding it. \"I was imagining this lake as something grander [...] How could it sustain itself on the tippy top of a mountain?\" The sleeve includes pictures of the group and Offord that were photographed by Dean and Martyn Adelman, who had played with Squire in the late 1960s as a member of The Syn. Dean wrote the sleeve's text and lyric sheet by hand. On reflection on the album's design, Dean said: \"There were a couple of ideas that merged there. It was of a waterfall constantly refreshing itself, pouring from all sides of the lake, but where was the water coming from? I was looking for an image to portray that\"."]}, {"page": "The Syn", "response": ["The Syn are an English band that were active from 1965 to 1967, and then reunited as a progressive rock band in 2004. The band was founded by Steve Nardelli, Chris Squire, Andrew Pryce Jackman, Martyn Adelman and John Painter. Chris Welch, in his book, Close to the Edge: The Story of Yes wrote, \"The Syn were very similar to Yes in fact. It was very much a precursor of Yes.\"Close to the Edge: The Story of Yes by Chris Welch", "The Selfs were a rhythm and blues band formed in 1964 in Wembley, London. The band was formed of bassist Chris Squire, keyboardist Andrew Pryce Jackman, drummer Martyn Adelman, and guitarist John Wheatley, and singer Chris Slater. A future line-up included drummer Mike Richardson. The band played their first gigs at The Graveyard, a youth club at St. Andrew's church in Kingsbury, and Blackbirds Cross in Wembley. In 1964, they took part in Ready Steady Win, a music competition run by the producers of the music television show Ready Steady Go! They were beaten in a heat of the competition by the eventual winners, the Bo Street Runners. The Selfs recorded an acetate \"Love You\" and a cover of the Who's \"I Can't Explain\".", "Shortly after, however, in 1965, The Syn merged with The Selfs, so Nardelli and Painter were joined by Chris Squire (bass), Andrew Jackman (keys) and Martyn Adelman (drums). The band's first gig, at Nardelli's school, Kingsbury County Grammar School, included covers of \"Heat Wave\" and The Marvelettes' \"I'll Keep On Holding On\".

The band also got a new manager, Peter Huggett, former bass player with Lonnie Donegan. Huggett was later replaced by Kenny Bell as manager.", "The Syn reunion grew out of two events. In 2003, Martyn Adelman contacted the webmaster of a Yes fan site and agreed to do an interview. Steve Nardelli saw this and was put back in touch with Adelman. With Banks too, they met up for lunch and discussed a reunion. Around the same time, Andrew Jackman died, and there was a desire to mark his passing."]}, {"page": "Adelman", "response": ["* Martyn Adelman (born 1947), British photographer and former drummer"]}, {"page": "Andrew Pryce Jackman", "response": ["In the mid-1960s, Jackman was the keyboard player in the Selfs with Squire and drummer Martyn Adelman.

Nardelli reformed the Syn with Peter Banks and Martyn Adelman in 2004. The line-up changed, re-uniting Nardelli with Chris Squire, and together they wrote Syndestructible (2005) with contributions from Gerard Johnson and Paul Stacey. This was followed by the album Armistice Day, the title track being written by Nardelli and Johnson. Squire, Johnson and Stacey all left the band, and Nardelli formed a new line-up with Francis Dunnery and Tom Brislin. They released Big Sky in 2009. Nardelli started working in collaboration with Swedish band Moon Safari on a new album in 2010 from the Syn called Trustworks.  In an interview for Progzilla radio in October, Nardelli announced that The Syn Live at Rosfest album was being released early in 2015, together with a newly commissioned film The Syn in the 21st Century, as a prelude to the release of the new studio album Trustworks.
