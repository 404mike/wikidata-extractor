Collins was not the first Clifton schoolboy to hold this record: in 1868, Edward Tylecote, who went on to help England reclaim the Ashes in 1882\u201383, was a previous holder, with 404 not out in a game between Classicals and Moderns.

One of them, Edward Peglar, is said to have remarked that Collins's score was \"628, plus or minus twenty shall we say\". The other scorer for the match was J. W. Hall, whose father in 1868 had batted with Edward Tylecote, who later played Test cricket for England and whose name is on a poem kept with the Ashes urn. Tylecote had earlier set a world-record score of 404 not out in 1868, also at Clifton.

The match was reported across the contemporary press, though it was stressed that the quality of the opposition bowling was weak. Roe's first-class career never reached the heights it might have done; he was generally an inconsistent scorer, and scored just four hundreds in first-class cricket. His struggles were mirrored by his county side, Somerset, who flitted between first- and second-class cricket during his career. He played for the county from 1879 until 1899, and scored 2,690 runs in all first-class matches.", "In 1868, Edward Tylecote had become the first batsman to score a quadruple century (400 runs) in cricket, when he accumulated 404 not out in an internal match at Clifton College. W. G. Grace had got close to the total in 1876, but ran out of batting partners to finish on 400 not out. In the summer of 1881, Roe achieved his fame, by surpassing them both. In an intercollegiate match between the \"long vacation clubs\" of Gonville and Caius and Emmanuel, Roe was called upon as a guest player for Emmanuel, who had only managed to find nine players. Caius batted first, and were dismissed for 100 runs exactly, Roe taking half of their wickets and Charles Allcock the other half. Roe and Allcock then proceeded to open the batting for Emmanuel, finishing the day on 157 without the loss of either batsman. The next afternoon Roe reached his century early, and then after scoring 200 runs he could have been out three times, but each chance was missed. Against bowling described in the contemporary press as weak, he batted through the rest of the day to finish on 415 not out. The game was played on a ground with no boundaries, so he had to run each of his team's 708 runs, a distance of nearly eight miles. In all, he scored 1 six, 6 fives, 16 fours, 48 threes, 52 twos and 67 ones, but so fastidious was Roe, that when he came off the field at the close of play, he challenged the scorer for crediting him one run short; Roe had counted 416 runs. Roe's record was beaten by James Stewart Carrick in 1885, when the latter scored 419 not out for the West of Scotland against Priory Park, Chichester."]}, {"page": "Edmund Tylecote", "response": ["#REDIRECTEdward Tylecote"]}, {"page": "EFS Tylecote", "response": ["#REDIRECTEdward Tylecote"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 1882\u201383", "response": ["England was captained by Ivo Bligh and had Edward Tylecote as its specialist wicket-keeper, the other players being Billy Bates, Dick Barlow, Allan Steel, Charles Leslie, Walter Read, Charles Studd, Fred Morley, Billy Barnes, George Vernon and George Studd."]}, {"page": "Edward Ferdinando Sutton Tylecote", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Tylecote"]}, {"page": "List of Old Cliftonians", "response": ["* Edward Tylecote, England cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Edward Tylecote (1871\u20131886)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Edward Tylecote (1874\u20131886) : E.
