He played representative level rugby union (RU) for Wales, and at club level for Bedwas RFC, Cardiff RFC and Bridgend RFC, as a fly-half, i.e. number 10, and club level rugby league (RL) for Salford. Noted for his drop-goals, Ken Richards would often take penalties and conversions using the drop goal method rather than placing the ball, during September 1961 he scored a drop goal penalty against Doncaster from 55 yards (50 metres).\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
