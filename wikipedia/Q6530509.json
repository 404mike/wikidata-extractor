Although she won a majority of 92 out of 140 Walton Labour Party members, once the union votes were counted, Peter Kilfoyle became the Labour Party candidate.  In the ensuing by-election, Kilfoyle won with 21,317 (53.1%) votes while Mahmood, standing as Walton Real Labour, came third with 2,613 and 6.5% of the vote. The Walton by-election was a factor in the decision by Militant to leave the Labour Party, setting up first Militant Labour and then the Socialist Party.Mahmood was later active in support of the sacked Liverpool Dockers.
