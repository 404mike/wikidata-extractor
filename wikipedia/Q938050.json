He left to be a commercials producer at Collett, Dickenson & Pearce (CDP). In 1970, he and director Alan Parker established an advertising company, which brought the pair domestic and international awards. \nBefore producing feature films, with help from CDP, Marshall and Parker started the TVC production company Alan Parker Productions. Marshall and Parker's first feature film, the 1976 musical Bugsy Malone, garnered critical success, achieving eight British Academy Award nominations. The pair followed their successful feature film debut with the 1978 neo-noir drama Midnight Express, written by Oliver Stone, with David Puttnam joining the producing team. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, and took home Oscars for best screenplay and best original score. It was also nominated for the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or. \nMarshall continued to make his mark as a film producer with critical films including Fame, Shoot the Moon, and Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall. After the 1987 film Angel Heart, Marshall decided to leave working with Parker to focus on other feature films. Marshall has been the producer for other features such as Homeboy, Jacob's Ladder, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Picture", "response": ["| Alan Marshall and David Puttnam"]}, {"page": "Showgirls", "response": ["| Alan Marshall and Charles Evans", "| Alan Marshall and Charles Evans"]}, {"page": "Midnight Express (film)", "response": ["| Alan Marshall and David Puttnam"]}, {"page": "Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama", "response": ["| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1978|| style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Midnight Express  || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Alan Parker || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Alan Marshall"]}, {"page": "Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Bugsy Malone || Alan Parker || Alan Marshall", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Fame || Alan Parker || David De Silva & Alan Marshall"]}, {"page": "Alan Parker", "response": ["His first job was office boy in the post room of an advertising agency. But more than anything, he said, he wanted to write, and would write essays and ads when he got home after work. His colleagues also encouraged him to write, which soon led him to a position as a copywriter in the company. Parker took jobs with different agencies over the next few years, having by then become proficient as a copywriter. One such agency was Collett Dickenson Pearce in London, where he first met the future producers David Puttnam and Alan Marshall, both of whom would later produce many of his films. Parker credited Puttnam with inspiring him and talking him into writing his first film script, Melody (1971).", "By 1968, Parker had moved from copywriting to successfully directing numerous television advertisements. In 1970, he joined Alan Marshall to establish a company to make advertisements. That company eventually became one of Britain's best commercial production houses, winning nearly every major national and international award open to it.Wakeman, John, ed. World Film Directors, Vol. II, H.W. Wilson Co., N.Y. (1988) pp. 740\u2013743 Among their award-winning adverts were the UK Cinzano vermouth advertisement (starring Joan Collins and Leonard Rossiter), and a Heineken advert which used one hundred actors. Parker credited his years writing and directing adverts for his later success as a film director: After writing the screenplay for the Waris Hussein film Melody in 1971, Parker shot his first fictional film titled No Hard Feelings in 1973, for which he wrote the script. The film is a bleak love story set against the Blitz in London during the Second World War, when the Luftwaffe bombed the city for 57 consecutive nights.Parker, Alan. Making of \"No Hard Feelings\" Parker was born during one of those bombing raids, and said \"the baby in that [film] could well have been me\". With no feature film directing experience, he could not find financial backing, and decided to risk using his own money and funds from mortgaging his house to cover the cost. The film impressed the BBC, which bought the film and showed it on television a few years later, in 1976. The BBC producer Mark Shivas had, in the interim, also contracted Parker to direct The Evacuees (1975), a Second World War story written by Jack Rosenthal which was shown as a Play for Today. The work was based on true events which involved the evacuation of school children from central Manchester for protection.\"The Evacuees\", Alan Parker Biography The Evacuees won a BAFTA for best TV drama and also an Emmy for best International Drama."]}, {"page": "David Puttnam", "response": ["Puttnam had a box office success with Bugsy Malone (1976), a musical he executive-produced, written and directed by Alan Parker, and produced by Alan Marshall.

Even though the police were on set and a restraining order was in place, producer Alan Marshall individually picked out each protester he wanted arrested.

In the film, Jacob Singer's experiences before and during his service in Vietnam result in strange, fragmentary visions and bizarre hallucinations that continue to haunt him. As his ordeal worsens, Jacob desperately attempts to figure out the truth.", "Rubin's work on Jacob's Ladder began in 1980, sparked by his nightmare in which he dreamt about being trapped in a subway. For several years, Rubin tried to sell the script, without success; Thom Mount of Universal Pictures said he \"loved it, but it was not for his studio\". Directors Michael Apted, Sidney Lumet and Ridley Scott all expressed an interest in making the film, but still no major studio was ready to invest in Rubin's \"too metaphysical\" stories as \"Hollywood does not make ghost movies\". Eventually, after Deadly Friend was filmed by Wes Craven in 1986, Rubin's screenplays for both Jacob's Ladder and Ghost were picked by Paramount Pictures. In 1988, Adrian Lyne, who described Rubin's work as \"certainly one of the best scripts I've ever read\", decided then to direct it instead of an adaptation of The Bonfire of the Vanities as he had originally planned (incidentally, Tom Hanks, an actor originally considered by Lyne for the role of Jacob, ended up starring in Bonfire). The ownership and policy changes at Paramount resulted in the cancellation of the project; the executives had doubts about the film's ending and the scenes taking place in Vietnam. The independent film studio Carolco Pictures decided to take over the production of Jacob's Ladder, giving Lyne a greater creative control and a budget of $25 million. Rubin became the film's co-producer, along with Mario Kassar, Alan Marshall and Andrew G.
