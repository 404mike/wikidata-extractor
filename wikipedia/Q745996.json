Barely a minute later he scored what was the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win for The Hammers having received the ball from Michael Hughes and flicking it past Barnsley goalkeeper David Watson. The season also saw his first hat-trick. On 19 November 1997, West Ham played Walsall in a League Cup, fourth-round game.

He received his first-ever red card when he was sent off in Wales' World Cup qualification match against Northern Ireland in September 2004 for reacting to a foul on him by midfielder Michael Hughes. Both Hughes and Savage were sent off, but, on later review, the punishment of Savage seemed harsh to some. Savage was ridiculed for threatening to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights over the decision. His once-impressive statistic of never being sent off in a Premiership match ended on 18 March 2006 when he was dismissed against Middlesbrough for two bookable offences. Both were controversial \u2013 the first for a challenge on George Boateng where he appeared to take the ball, and the second for handball when it seemed unintentional. Savage later admitted that he was probably due a controversial sending off because he had escaped punishment for illegal challenges in the past."]}, {"page": "Fitz Hall", "response": ["At the start of the 2005\u201306 season, Hall was appointed team captain of Crystal Palace, replacing Michael Hughes following the club's relegation back to the Championship. He helped the club keep three consecutive clean sheets between 20 August 2005 and 10 September 2005. Despite serving a suspension for picking up five yellow cards this season so far, Hall continued to start eleven matches in the centre\u2013back position, forming a partnership with Darren Ward. This lasted until he missed one match, due to suffering from a knock during a 1\u20131 draw against rivals, Millwall on 3 December 2005 and was substituted in the 59th minute. Halfway through the season, many Crystal Palace fans felt that Hall's performance was being hindered by the burden of captaincy, and after several poor performances, and several yellow cards, Hughes was re-appointed team captain in January 2006. Despite losing the captaincy, Hall remained in the first team until the end of the season, where at one point, he played in a full\u2013back position. During a 1\u20130 win against Cardiff City on 4 February 2006, Hall received a straight red card following an off-the-ball incident involving Joe Ledley and served a three match suspension. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the starting line\u2013up, in a 1\u20131 draw against rivals, Millwall on 18 February 2006. This was followed up by scoring his second goal of the season, in a 4\u20131 win against Norwich City. After missing two matches due to another injury, his return saw him contribute to the club's place in the Championship play\u2013offs. Hall played in both legs of the Championship play\u2013offs against Watford, as Crystal Palace lost 3\u20130. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he went on to make forty\u2013four appearances and scoring once in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Michael Hughes (soccer player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Hughes (footballer)"]}, {"page": "2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)", "response": ["* Michael Hughes"]}, {"page": "1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)", "response": ["* Michael Hughes"]}, {"page": "St Neots Town F.C.", "response": ["The club's ambition to move on was shown with the 2009 addition of former Northern Ireland internationals Steve Lomas and Michael Hughes as a player managerial team, where they were joined by Sylvain Legwinski, formerly of Fulham."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["26 March 2000 saw West Ham meet Wimbledon.

Injuries to key and back-up players were critical (losing Stan Lazaridis to a broken leg, for instance, and what turned out to be the career-ending injury to the promising Richard Hall signed only months before for \u00a31.5\u00a0million from Southampton), but so were the failed signings and some poor performances. The form of Michael Hughes (signed permanently after two years on loan from Strasbourgh) and performances of loan signing Hugo Porf\u00edrio were a rare bright spot, as was the emergence of future England teammates Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard. In a 2\u20132 draw with Manchester United, R\u0103ducioiu contributed a curling left footed shot around a full-stretch Peter Schmeichel.

This allowed Redknapp to blood the young talent of Rio Ferdinand in his preferred role as a sweeper whilst pairing him with two competent defenders. The pacey Stan Lazaridis and Andy Impey took over wingback roles, whilst the centre of midfield was contested by Lampard, Lomas and Berkovic, with Moncur preferred over Ian Bishop in reserve and Michael Hughes out in the cold. In goal, Miklo\u0161ko started the year, but injury curtailed his season (and by the next summer had moved on to QPR), resulting in Craig Forrest stepping in.

The midlanders were now managed by former United manager Ron Atkinson. They won 3\u20132 to ensure that the home side's survival remained far from certain, but more importantly they ensured that their challenge for the title remained very much alive. Blackburn had slipped up in their last two games, meaning that United had cut their lead to five points \u2013 and had a game in hand. In the next game six days later, David May scored the only goal of a 1\u20130 home win over Sheffield Wednesday to cut United's deficit behind his old club to two points with two games to go. This meant that a victory over Southampton at Old Trafford on 10 May would keep United in the title race right up to the very last game. United went down 1\u20130 in the fifth minute as the Saints scored through Simon Charlton, only for Andy Cole to equalise in the 21st minute. However, United were still being held to a 1\u20131 score well into the second half, and the championship celebrations were just minutes away from beginning in Blackburn. Then came an 80th-minute goal by Denis Irwin which won the game 2\u20131 for United and kept their title bid alive. The last game of the season, on 14 May, saw United travel to Upton Park for a clash with a West Ham United side who had just secured their safety. Blackburn, in contrast, had to travel to Anfield for a clash with Kenny Dalglish's old club Liverpool; their game undoubtedly appeared much harder on paper as Liverpool had finished fourth in the league and won the League Cup. However, the Hammers shocked United by going ahead in the 31st minute through Michael Hughes. Brian McClair did equalise in the 52nd minute, and as the game wore on United fought against the clock to score a winner, but West Ham remained resilient and after two late blunders by Andy Cole, the game ended 1\u20131 and United lost the title, which went to Blackburn in spite of their 2\u20131 defeat at Liverpool."]}, {"page": "List of RC Strasbourg Alsace seasons", "response": ["| D1 || 13th || 34 || 38 || 10 || 14 || 14 || 43 || 47 || \u22124 || 1/32 f. ||  || \u2013 || Michael HughesFrank Leb\u0153uf || 7"]}, {"page": "2004 Football League First Division play-off Final", "response": ["Crystal Palace manager Iain Dowie had been appointed in December 2003 with the club in 19th position, before losing just six times in the final half of the season to finish sixth, a turnaround in form described by the BBC as \"a remarkable transformation\".
