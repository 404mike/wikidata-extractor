Using just eight tracks limited Collins' recording possibilities, but as a reggae producer he decided to use the common reggae method of recording everything in mono: \"As we were recording eight-track, I did go with a track plan. I wanted the drums in mono on one track, the bass in mono on another and the rhythm \u2013 that shuffle organ and Lynval's DI'd guitar \u2013 on another. They're the backbone of a reggae song. Then there was brass on another track, lead vocals on another, backing vocals on another, and various little bits and pieces dropped in\u00a0...'Ghost Town' is basically a mono record with stereo reverb and echo that I added in the mix\u00a0...

Recording simply in mono really helped the instruments balance themselves.\" However, there was a tense moment towards the end of recording when Dammers decided at the last minute that he wanted to add a flute to the song, and with no free tracks available Collins was forced to record the flute directly onto the track containing the previously recorded brass section, with the possibility that any error would have rendered the entire track unusable:", "*John Bradbury \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Press to Play", "response": ["* John Bradbury\u00a0\u2013 violin"]}, {"page": "Too Much Pressure", "response": ["In 1977, Coventry-based musicians Neol Davies (guitar), Barry Jones (trombone) and John Bradbury (drums) recorded a rocksteady instrumental together named \"The Kingston Affair\".
