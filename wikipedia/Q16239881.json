In North America are Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, while the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are located in South America. The Caribbean islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction of a number of European monarchs, mostly English, Dutch, or Spanish, throughout the first half of the 17th century. By 1681, however, when the Turks and Caicos Islands were settled by Britons, all of the above-mentioned islands were under the control of Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown's Caribbean regions, until 19 December 1980, the date that Anguilla became a British Crown territory in its own right. The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by: the Governor of Anguilla, Tim Foy; the Governor of Bermuda, John Rankin; the Governor of the British Virgin Islands, Gus Jaspert; the Governor of the Cayman Islands, Helen Kilpatrick; the Governor of Montserrat, Andrew Pearce; and the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands, John Freeman."]}, {"page": "2010 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Helen Kilpatrick, Director-General, Financial and Commercial, Home Office"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2013", "response": ["**#Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2014", "response": ["**Governor\u00a0\u2013 Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2015", "response": ["**Governor\u00a0\u2013 Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of female constituent and dependent territory leaders", "response": ["|Helen Kilpatrick"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2016", "response": ["**Governor\u00a0\u2013 Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of permanent under secretaries of state of the Home Office", "response": ["* Helen Kilpatrick 2012\u20132013 (acting)"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2017", "response": ["**Governor\u00a0\u2013 Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of governors of dependent territories in the 21st century", "response": ["::*Helen Kilpatrick, Governor (2013\u2013present)Helen Kilpatrick sworn in as new governor , Cayman NetNews, September 6, 2013"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2018", "response": ["**# Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2018", "response": ["**#Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2017", "response": ["** Governor \u2013 Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2016", "response": ["** Governor \u2013 Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2015", "response": ["** Governor \u2013 Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2014", "response": ["** Governor \u2013 Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2013", "response": ["**#Helen Kilpatrick, Governor of the Cayman Islands (2013\u2013present) "]}]}}
