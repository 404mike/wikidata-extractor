Hamilton Academical took their place in the fifth round. 2008\u201309 proved a season of upheaval as O'Neill left on 15 December 2008 to take charge of Republic of Ireland side Shamrock Rovers, although the experienced Jim Duffy followed him into the hotseat on 9 January 2009 and led the club to third place and a play-off place. Once again however the play-offs did not prove rewarding as Ayr United recorded a 5\u20132 aggregate win over the club to leave Brechin City in the Second Division for 2009\u201310. Under Duffy Brechin made the play-offs again the following season but Duffy resigned after Brechin were beaten 3\u20130 on aggregate by Cowdenbeath."]}, {"page": "Ian Russell", "response": ["*Iain Russell (born 1982), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Scottish Second Division", "response": ["| Iain Russell || style=\"text-align:center;\"|21 ||Brechin City"]}, {"page": "Kevin McCann (footballer, born 1987)", "response": ["On 10 March 2012, he played in a trial match for Livingston against his former club Greenock Morton.
