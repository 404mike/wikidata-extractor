Gillard was on the search for a senior producer to head the new Unit, and asked David Attenborough to take on the role. Attenborough had good credentials (he was a trained zoologist) but declined, having recently settled in London with his young family. Instead, he was placed in charge of the newly formed Travel and Exploration Unit, striking a deal which would allow him to continue to film his popular Zoo Quest (1954\u20131963) series alongside natural history output from the fledgling Bristol unit. The Travel and Exploration Unit in London also introduced viewers to more exotic wildlife, and made household names of the first natural history presenters. Armand and Michaela Denis filmed East African wildlife for their On Safari programmes, whilst another pioneering husband-and-wife team, Hans and Lotte Hass, created some of the first underwater films."]}, {"page": "Michaela", "response": ["*Michaela Denis (1914\u20132003), British-born film-maker"]}, {"page": "BBC Natural History Unit filmography", "response": ["| On Safari || 1957\u20131965 || Filming animals in East Africa || Armand and Michaela Denis (presenter) || No || No"]}, {"page": "Armand Denis", "response": ["He was born in Brussels, BelgiumOn Safari, The story of my life (autobiography) (though the family moved to Antwerp soon after his birth), the son of a judge, and developed an interest in travel and the natural world as a child.
