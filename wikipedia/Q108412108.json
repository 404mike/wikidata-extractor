Bruce then lived at 43 Lauriston Place, south of the church by 1\u00a0km.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1835 In 1837 he replaced Andrew Grant as minister of St Andrews Church on George Street in the New Town. The significance of this move is now less visible, as moving from the city cathedral to an outer paerish now looks like a negative step. However, in the 1830s a New Town location represented a far more affluent congregation, than the largely poor congregation still inhabiting the Old Town. Whilst serving St Andrews he lived at 4 Queen Street a large Georgian townhouse immediately north of the church.Edinburgh Post Office Diectory 1840"]}]}}
