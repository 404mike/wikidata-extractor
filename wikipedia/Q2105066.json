He sketched and painted scenes of this work, notably in his 1919 oil painting Erecting a Camouflage Tree, which was intended for the, never built, British national Hall of Remembrance and was in turn purchased by the Imperial War Museum."]}, {"page": "1860 in art", "response": ["* September 16 \u2013 Solomon Joseph Solomon, English portrait painter (died 1927)"]}, {"page": "List of British Jews", "response": ["* Solomon Joseph Solomon, painter"]}, {"page": "British heavy tanks of World War I", "response": ["When first deployed, British tanks were painted with a four-colour camouflage scheme devised by the artist Solomon Joseph Solomon.
