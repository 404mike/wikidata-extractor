A vigilante group called the Ulster Service Corps was organised by this group.Flackes & Elliott, p. 347 In May 1977 this group convinced the UWC to lead a second strike in an attempt to replicate the success of three years earlier. This time however, unlike in 1974, the UUAC did not have obvious demands and the strike did not have the support of the Ulster Unionist Party or the Vanguard and it also failed to convince electricity workers to support it, resulting in only limited disruption to power.Flackes & Elliott, p. 345 Barr announced his public opposition to the strike, Harry West led counter demonstrations urging a return to work and Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief Constable Kenneth Newman, under instruction from new Secretary of State Roy Mason, took an aggressive line smashing through makeshift barricades set up on areas such as the Shankill Road with convoys of new police armoured land rovers.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 101\u2013102 The strike descended into chaos with a series of setbacks, notably UDA gunman Kenny McClinton shooting and killing Protestant bus driver Harry Bradshaw on the Crumlin Road for his refusal to strike, an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment soldier being killed by a bomb in the same area, UDA members William Hobbs and James McClurg accidentally immolating themselves whilst making petrol bombs in Rathcoole and Ian Paisley being arrested at a rally in Ballymena by Superintendent John Hermon.McDonald & Cusack, p. 102"]}, {"page": "United Ulster Unionist Council", "response": ["The UUUC set up the United Unionist Action Council (UUAC) in 1977 a policy group and an activism co-ordinating committee.

However the second strike proved much less effective and did not get the backing of the Ulster Unionists, who in fact campaigned against it. The strike proved the final straw for the UUUC with the UUP, DUP and UUUP going their separate ways after it collapsed."]}, {"page": "List of members of the 12th House of Commons of Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Joseph Burns"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 11th House of Commons of Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Joseph Burns"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 10th House of Commons of Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Joseph Burns"]}, {"page": "Rainey Endowed School", "response": ["*Joseph Burns, Unionist politician"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 9th House of Commons of Northern Ireland", "response": ["*29 November 1960: Joseph Burns elected for the Ulster Unionists in North Londonderry, following the death of Robert Moore."]}, {"page": "List of Northern Ireland Parliament by-elections", "response": ["|Joseph Burns"]}, {"page": "Minister of Finance (Northern Ireland)", "response": ["*1968 \u2013 1969 Samuel Magowan and Joseph Burns"]}, {"page": "North Londonderry (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)", "response": ["* 1958\u20131973: Joseph Burns, Ulster Unionist Party", "At the 1960 North Londonderry by-election, and the 1962 and 1965 Northern Ireland general elections, Joseph Burns was elected unopposed."]}, {"page": "Joseph Burns", "response": ["Joseph Burns may refer to:", "*Joseph Burns (U.S. politician) (1800\u20131875), U.S. Representative from Ohio", "*Joseph Burns (Northern Ireland politician) (born 1906), Ulster Unionist politician, represented North Londonderry, 1958\u20131972", "*Joseph Burns (baseball) (1889\u20131987), MLB outfielder for the Detroit Tigers", "*Joseph Burns (murderer) (c. 1806\u20131848), New Zealand murderer"]}, {"page": "Minister of Health and Local Government", "response": ["*1971 - 1972 Joseph Burns"]}, {"page": "Ulster Unionist Chief Whip", "response": [":1968: Samuel Magowan and Joseph Burns"]}, {"page": "Joseph Burns (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Burns (Northern Ireland politician)"]}, {"page": "Joseph Burns (British politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Burns (Northern Ireland politician)"]}]}}
