Despite this, the club's dire finances meant that he was only able to bring in three new attackers on free transfers: Ken Wookey (Newport County); Stuart Shaw (Southport); and Eric Magee (Oldham Athletic). Vale started the season with a club-record unbeaten 18 matches, and Lee began playing midfielder Tommy McLaren on a regular basis. Vale's financial situation was highlighted by the fact that they could not afford the \u00a3500 registration fee for Ian Buxton following the player's departure from Notts County. The \"Valiants\" were knocked off the top of the table following a bout of injuries, and Lee was forced to sign wing-half Tony Lacey on loan from Stoke City, and also bought Bill Summerscales from Leek Town for \u00a3400. As promotion was secured with a nine-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Lacey permanently for \u00a32,500 and also brought Sammy Morgan in on a free transfer from Gorleston. Speaking of their third-place finish, Lee said that \"no team could have deserved reward as much for their hard work and strength of character\"."]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Football League", "response": ["|  Tony Lacey (caretaker)"]}, {"page": "John Green (footballer, born 1939)", "response": ["Returning to Vale Park for the rest of the 1968\u201369 campaign, he found himself working under a new manager in Gordon Lee. Green struggled with his fitness but played twelve games, finding himself on the scoresheet in home wins against Newport County and Chester. He then helped the club to win promotion in 1969\u201370, and was an ever-present with 46 league and six cup appearances. He was given the club's Player of the Year award for his contribution to the campaign. He said that \"It came as a complete surprise, all the lads were sure it would be John James\". However, he could not translate this success over to the 1970\u201371 Third Division campaign, and new signings Brian Horton and Tony Lacey established themselves in the first eleven.

The season was largely forgettable, though increasing violence from hooligans was a cause for concern. \u00a330,000 was raised by sale of some land and \u00a310,000 was gained from Tony Lacey's move to Rochdale. 'Troubles at the top' were eventually settled with the re-election of old chairman Mark Singer. Only 2,743 turned up for the final appearance of club legend Roy Sproson, as Lee became increasingly angered by low turnouts. Only eleven points were won at home, as the club finished in mid-table yet again.", "A dire financial situation meant seven players were released for 1975\u201376: John Woodward, Tony Lacey, Roy Cross, Bill Summerscales, Frank Sharp and Reg Edwards. Attempts to sign Wales  internationals Mike England and Wyn Davies failed, and so Mick Cullerton, Terry Lees and Geoff Morris were the only new signings. Cullerton was in fine scoring form, though the promotion campaign fell away and Horton was sold to Brighton for \u00a330,000, which led to a healthy profit on the season. For the club's centenary celebrations a match was held with Stoke City, which finished 1\u20131, an impressive result considering the \"Potters\" were going through one of the most successful periods in their history."]}, {"page": "Anthony John Lacey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Lacey"]}, {"page": "Anthony Lacey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Lacey"]}]}}
