A winger whose strengths were dribbling and crossing the ball but who lacked pace, he made his first-team debut on 19 October 1889, playing at inside left in a 2\u20132 draw away at The Wednesday in the Football Alliance. He became a first-team regular in the 1890\u201391 season, but lost his place to new arrival \"Toddy\" Hands in December 1890, played only twice more for the first team, and dropped back into local non-league football in 1892.He is often confused with another Billy Pratt, a left back who did not join the club until 1894.", "link_mentions": {}}}
