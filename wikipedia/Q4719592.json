He was born in Dublin on 18 December 1829 and died in Holyhead on 14 December 1904.  He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with an honours BA in mathematics (1851). He brought order and standardisation to the workshops and locomotive designs of the Great Southern and Western Railway of Ireland, and was later employed to do the same for the North Eastern Railway in England, although resistance to his changes meant little progress was made before he left.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mason Bogie locomotive", "response": ["It became obvious that, for all the Double Fairlie locomotive's advantages, its disadvantages outweighed them. In 1869, a Single Fairlie locomotive  had been designed and constructed by Alexander McDonnell for the Great Southern and Western Railway in Ireland. This had a single boiler with one articulated, powered truck beneath it and a second, unpowered truck beneath the cab and bunker.

Following amalgamation, it took some time for these establishments to be consolidated, and the number of departmental heads reduced. For example, the Manchester and Bolton Railway had amalgamated in 1846 but its locomotives remained separate until Salford works was closed in 1849, when the work was transferred to the former Manchester and Leeds Railway workshops at Miles Platting. In 1875, the facilities at Miles Platting were under the charge of William Hurst and William Yates, who were appointed outdoor superintendent and indoor superintendent respectively on 22 January 1868, both being in succession to William Jenkins. The locomotives of the former East Lancashire Railway were repaired at Bury, and were also the responsibility of two men: John Jacques, who was appointed outdoor superintendent on 24 April 1865, and George Roberts, who had been appointed indoor superintendent following the death of R. Mason on 15 October 1873. Hurst was due to retire in 1875, and the LYR board decided to replace all four men by a single locomotive superintendent, and the post was advertised in August 1875. A short-list of six names was chosen, and interviewed on 27 October 1875. This reduced the six names to two: Alexander McDonnell, of the Great Southern and Western Railway in Ireland, and William Barton Wright, who had been working for the Madras Railway in India. Barton Wright was appointed chief locomotive superintendent from 1 November 1875, and the following day, Yates, Hurst, Jacques and Roberts were brought in and told that they would now report to Barton Wright. Hurst retired, whilst Yates and Roberts became works managers, at Miles Platting and Bury respectively. Jacques was given the opportunity to resign with six months salary."]}, {"page": "GS&WR Class 2", "response": ["This class of 4-4-0 locomotives was designed by Alexander McDonnell, the Locomotive Superintendent of the GS&WR, and built between 1877 and 1880. The locomotives were intended for light branch line work and they made their mark on the lightly laid Kerry line, gaining the name \"Kerry Bogies\" although they were also used on the Cork to Youghal line and as an assisting engine on the steeply graded (1 in 60 / 1.7 %) section of the main line from Glanmire to Blarney, this latter work taxing their capabilities to the limit."]}, {"page": "GS&WR Class 201", "response": ["The GS&WR Class 201 was a class of ten  locomotives designed by Locomotive Engineer, Henry Ivatt in 1887 for shunting heavy goods trains at Kingsbridge and Cork yards.

The locomotives were built in three batch with variations between batches: Nos. 207\u2014210 were introduced in 1887; 201 and 202 followed in 1895 taking numbers formerly held by Sambo and Negro; while the final batch 214\u2014217 emerged in 1901."]}, {"page": "GS&WR Class 101", "response": ["The design is attributed to Alexander McDonnell, although evidence points to him developing the design from drawings supplied from Beyer, Peacock and Company of Manchester, England.

The first three locomotives from Inchicore, Nos. 112 (June 1866), 113 (December 1866), and 118 (May 1867) are considered hybrids; recent analysis seems to indicate all nine Inchicore builds to No. 115 in October 1869 to be hybrid builds.  Eight Beyer Peacock built Class 101 were built between May 1867 and March 1868. Inchicore built Nos. 155 and 156 with short wheelbases ( less between the second and third axles, as per Nos. 114 and 115) in 1871 before commencing new builds of standard locomotives with No. 159 in September 1871.", "*Designer: Alexander McDonnell"]}, {"page": "Edward Fletcher (engineer)", "response": ["He was apprenticed to George Stephenson beginning in 1825 and helped with the construction of Stephenson's Rocket and the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway.
