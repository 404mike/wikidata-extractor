The band sampled the drum track with a sampler and edited it with a Macintosh computer, inspired by the music of DJ Shadow, but admitted to making approximations in emulating Shadow's style due to their programming inexperience. The bassline stops and starts unexpectedly, achieving an effect similar to 1970s dub. The song's references to automobile accidents and reincarnation were inspired by a magazine article titled \"An Airbag Saved My Life\" and The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Yorke wrote \"Airbag\" about the illusion of safety offered by modern transit, and \"the idea that whenever you go out on the road you could be killed\". The BBC wrote of the influence of J. G. Ballard, especially his 1973 novel Crash, on the lyrics. Music journalist Tim Footman noted that the song's technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrated the \"key paradox\" of the album: \"The musicians and producer are delighting in the sonic possibilities of modern technology; the singer, meanwhile, is railing against its social, moral, and psychological impact ... It's a contradiction mirrored in the culture clash of the music, with the 'real' guitars negotiating an uneasy stand-off with the hacked-up, processed drums.\"", "OK Computer was almost uniformly praised on release. Critics generally described it as a landmark release of far-reaching impact and importance, but noted that its experimentalism made it a challenging listen. According to Tim Footman, \"Not since 1967, with the release of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, had so many major critics agreed immediately, not only on an album's merits, but on its long-term significance, and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history.\" In the British press, the album garnered favourable reviews in NME,"]}, {"page": "Enema of the State", "response": ["The success of the album, as well as its cleaner sound and the group's appearances on MTV, caused many longtime fans to accuse the band of \"selling out.\" Many commentators stated that the band's polished pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. Although the video for \"All the Small Things\" was filmed as a mockery of boy bands and teen pop, \"fame [didn't] discriminate based on origin: soon the group was as famous as those it was parodying.\" \"Blink now had the backing of a major record company\u00a0... just like the synthesized pop acts they were spoofing,\" said British journalist Tim Footman. \"In what way were they less 'pop' than Sugar Ray and 98 Degrees?\" Matt Diehl, author of the book My So-Called Punk, called the basis for satire thin: \"To seasoned ears, Blink-182 sounded and looked just as manufactured as the pop idols they were poking fun at.\" The band faced a backlash shortly after Enema of the State was released from several punk and emo acts who wished to not be associated with their music."]}, {"page": "The Bends (album)", "response": ["In the US, The Bends was released on 4 April by Radiohead's North American distributor, Capitol Records, \"who almost refused to release the album, since it was lacking any obvious hit singles\", according to the journalist Tim Footman. It debuted at the bottom of the Billboard 200 in the week of 13 May, before peaking at number 147 in the week of 24 June, and dropping off the chart after nine weeks. The American lead single \"Fake Plastic Trees\" peaked at number 11 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks and number 65 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart."]}, {"page": "Paranoid Android", "response": ["Stanley Donwood worked with Yorke to design the artwork for most of the \"Paranoid Android\" releases,Footman, 2007. p. 126 although both the images and design were ultimately credited to \"dumb computers\".
