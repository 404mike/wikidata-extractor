They presented both a threat to Allied shipping and an impediment to the movement of reinforcements through the Italian ports, but despite strong protests from Drake and Lord Hervey, Ambassador to Tuscany, the Republican sympathisers in Genoa and Leghorn refused to compel the French ships to leave. In July Modeste and the French corvette Badine had deliberately obstructed the frigate HMS Aigle in the neutral harbour, forcing Captain John Nicholson Inglefield to take evasive action, a calculated insult.Ireland, p. 146 In consequence, Hood resolved that the frigates be eliminated so that the Republicans in Genoa would be coerced into withdrawing their support.James, p. 87"]}, {"page": "Malta Dockyard", "response": ["* 1801\u20131803 Captain John Nicholson Inglefield (co-held title at Gibraltar)"]}, {"page": "Henry Whitby", "response": ["Henry Whitby was a captain in the Royal Navy.
