He was born in Plymouth, Devon.Preston was one of four trainees joining Torquay United in February 1994, after five existing trainees had been sacked by the club. His league debut came the following season: he made eight league appearances on the right wing as Torquay finished bottom of the Football League, only avoiding relegation to the Conference because Stevenage Borough's ground failed to meet the required standard. He turned professional in July 1996 and made two substitute appearances over the following Christmas period. However, he received knee cartilage and cruciate ligament damage in a reserve game at home to Plymouth Argyle on 28 January 1997 and was never to appear in the Gulls' first team again. He was eventually released at the end of the 1997\u201398 season and joined Weymouth that summer.\nIn 1999\u20132000, Preston was playing for South Western League club Holsworthy, and before the 2000\u201301 season, he joined fellow South Western League side Saltash United but made limited appearances due to persistent knee problems. Preston eventually retired from playing competitively at the end of the 2002\u20132003 season and now works as an electrician.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 22", "response": ["*  1977   \u2013 Michael Preston, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1977", "response": ["* November 22 \u2013 Michael Preston, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Saltash United F.C.", "response": ["* Michael Preston"]}, {"page": "Paul Adcock", "response": ["He stayed with the Terras until the summer of 2000. when his contract ran out.
