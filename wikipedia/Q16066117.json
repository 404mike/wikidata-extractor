Hill was the first European to see and traverse the Clare Valley.\nAn enigmatic and little-known individual, during the late 1830s John Hill sighted and named several important rivers of South Australia, as well as many lesser streams and creeks. The former unquestionably include the Wakefield and Hutt rivers, plus (most probably) the Gilbert and Light rivers. He was also the first European to explore the headwaters of the Torrens and Onkaparinga rivers.\nIn 1908 the Register newspaper (while incorrectly naming him 'William') accorded him the title of South Australia's \"Discoverer of Rivers\". Hill River and Mount Hill are named after him.", "link_mentions": {}}}
