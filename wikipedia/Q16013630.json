Milburn, along with his friend and teammate Raymond Poxton, attended United's final home game of the season. Milburn was distinctly unimpressed with what he saw, turning to his friend and saying \"Raymond, we could play better than this, surely?\" Soon after, he responded to an advertisement for trialists published in the North Mail Newspaper by Newcastle United prior to the 1943\u201344 season. The first trial was held in midweek and Milburn scored two goals in one half, earning an invitation to return on Saturday for a public trial at St James' and an 'amateur contract'. He arrived long before the 2pm kick-off with a pair of borrowed football boots wrapped in brown paper, and his lunch \u2013 two pies and a bottle of pop. Milburn's team of fellow trialists ('The Stripes') played against a Newcastle United First XI featuring Albert Stubbins and Jimmy Gordon ('The Blues'). The Stripes trailed 3\u20130 at half time and Joe Richardson told Milburn: \"you'd better buck your ideas up son, if you want to come here\". Switched to centre forward in the second half, Milburn scored six times as his side won 9\u20133. The Sunday Sun reported that \"United's second trial proved a triumph for Milburn, the Ashington inside-left, who was signed as an amateur earlier in the week. Milburn, a tall youth, showed a capacity for opportunism.
