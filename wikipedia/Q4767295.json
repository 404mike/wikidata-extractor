One of the Methodist ministers, Henry Beverhout, referred to Dawes as \"Pharaoh\", invoking the story of Moses to encourage the people of Sierra Leone to resist his governance.

Anna Maria was one of the first European women to publish an eyewitness account of her experiences in West Africa with her husband, a previous surgeon on a slave ship who later became an abolitionist. Anna Maria\u2019s writing of the two voyages were used in the campaign to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. Ironically, she defended the slave trade in her own narrative called the Two Voyages to the River Sierra Leone during the Years 1791\u20131792\u20131793. Specifically relating to the type of slave auction called the scramble, Christopher Fyfe, a Scottish historian who specializes in West African history, gives a description of it from Anna Maria Falconbridge\u2019s perspective.Christopher Fyfe, \"Sale of the Slaves\" in Anna Maria Falconbridge (2017), 216. The scrambles witnessed were in Jamaica, one in Kingston, and the other in Port Maria. For the scramble in Kingston, the slaves were all collected upon the main and quarter deck of the ship where it was darkened (in order to prevent potential buyers from clearly seeing the slaves). Once the signal was given for the scramble to commence, the buyers rushed in. Slaves were so terrified that almost thirty of them jumped ship. The scramble in Port Maria was conducted similarly to the one in Kingston. Only this time, the situation of the slaves was more described. Fyfe describes the women as being terrified, clinging to one another in protection, and in great agony. The buyers are described as savages because of the brutal way they rushed on the slaves to grab and eventually purchase them. ", "Alexander Falconbridge, husband of Anna Maria Falconbridge, who were both surgeons for four different voyages, recounts the scramble slave auction in his book, An Account of the Slave Trade on the Coast of Africa. He states that buyers would pay a fixed price for the captives that was negotiated among the ship's captains and the purchasers. Falconbridge describes that as soon as the agreed start hour came around the doors of the yard, where the captives were held, were thrown open, and the buyers instantly ran in to gather bondspeople. Some buyers came prepared by bringing handkerchiefs or ropes so they could tie the slaves together without losing them while grabbing others. Falconbridge calls the buyers \"brutes\" who had no form of sympathy for the captives; because of this, he recalls some of the enslaved to be so frightened that they would jump over the walls to escape. On the ship Golden Age, Falconbridge records the selling of 503 captives in two days in December 1784 at Port Maria, Jamaica.", "* Anna Maria Falconbridge", "Fyfe, Christopher. \"Sale of Slaves\" in Anna Maria Falconbridge: 2017."]}]}}
