While existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was Sartre. Sartre posits the idea that \"what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence,\" as the philosopher Frederick Copleston explains. According to philosopher Steven Crowell, defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself. In a lecture delivered in 1945, Sartre described existentialism as \"the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism.\"See James Wood. 2000. \"Introduction.\" Pp. iv\u2013ix in Nausea, by Jean-Paul Sartre.

In a review of Licks of Love (2001), Wood concluded that Updike's \"prose trusses things in very pretty ribbons\" but that there often exists in his work a \"hard, coarse, primitive, misogynistic worldview\". Wood both praised and criticized Updike's language for having \"an essayistic saunter; the language lifts itself up on pretty hydraulics, and hovers slightly above its subjects, generally a little too accomplished and a little too abstract\". According to Wood, Updike is capable of writing \"the perfect sentence\" and his style is characterized by a \"delicate deferral\" of the sentence. Of the beauty of Updike's language and his faith in the power of language that floats above reality, Wood wrote:", "For some time now Updike's language has seemed to encode an almost theological optimism about its capacity to refer. Updike is notably unmodern in his impermeability to silence and the interruptions of the abyss. For all his fabled Protestantism, both American Puritan and Lutheran-Barthian, with its cold glitter, its insistence on the aching gap between God and His creatures, Updike seems less like Hawthorne than Balzac, in his unstopping and limitless energy, and his cheerfully professional belief that stories can be continued; the very form of the Rabbit books\u2014here extended a further instance\u2014suggests continuance. Updike does not appear to believe that words ever fail us\u2014'life's gallant, battered ongoingness ', indeed\u2014and part of the difficulty he has run into, late in his career, is that he shows no willingness, verbally, to acknowledge silence, failure, interruption, loss of faith, despair and so on. Supremely, better than almost any other contemporary writer, he can always describe these feelings and states; but they are not inscribed in the language itself. Updike's language, for all that it gestures towards the usual range of human disappointment and collapse, testifies instead to its own uncanny success: to a belief that the world can always be brought out of its cloudiness and made clear in a fair season.James Wood, \"Gossip in Gilt\", London Review of Books, 19 April 2001"]}, {"page": "Paul Auster", "response": ["The English critic James Wood, however, offered Auster little praise:"]}, {"page": "Saul Bellow", "response": ["While sales of Bellow's first few novels were modest, that turned around with Herzog.

Lawrence called the one bright book of life?\""]}]}}
