The phrase northern soul was coined by a journalist Dave Godin and popularised through his column in Blues and Soul magazine.   The rare soul records were played by DJs at nightclubs, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an uptempo beat, such as those on Motown and smaller labels, not necessarily from the Northern United States."]}, {"page": "Northern soul", "response": ["The term \"northern soul\" emanated from the record shop Soul City in Covent Garden, London, which was run by famous soul music collector Dave Godin.Neil Rushton, Northern Soul Stories, Chapter 1, page 15 It was first publicly used in Godin's weekly column in Blues & Soul magazine in June 1970.Dave Godin.

Dave Godin is generally credited with being the first UK entrepreneur to start this trend, setting up the Soul City label in 1968, and striking a deal with EMI to license Gene Chandler's 1965 recording \"Nothing Can Stop Me\", which had been popular for several years at the Twisted Wheel. Issued as a 45 on Soul City, the track peaked at UK No. 41 in August 1968, becoming the first Northern Soul-derived chart hit.

Music that had failed to gain acceptance in a previous time was given a \"new lease on life\" by DJs on pirate radio stations.
