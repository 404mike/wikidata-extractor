They were originally known as the Rain before evolving into Oasis, and initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals, tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), and Tony McCarroll (drums). Upon returning to Manchester, Liam's older brother Noel (lead guitar, vocals) joined as a fifth member, finalising the band's core line-up. During the course of their existence, they had various line-up changes, though the Gallagher brothers remained as the staple members.", "In 1991, bassist Paul McGuigan, guitarist Paul Arthurs, drummer Tony McCarroll, and singer Chris Hutton formed a band called the Rain. Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a potential replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis, inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster in the childhood bedroom he shared with his brother Noel, which listed the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon as a venue.Harris, John. Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock. Da Capo Press, 2004. , pg.\u00a0124\u201325 Oasis played their first gig on the 14th August, 1991 at the Boardwalk club in Manchester, bottom of the bill below The Catchmen and Sweet Jesus. Noel, who was working as a roadie for Inspiral Carpets, went with them to watch Liam's band play. He and his friends did not think Oasis sounded particularly spectacular, but he began to consider the possibility of using the group as an outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining on the provision that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. Arthurs recalled, \"He had loads of stuff written. When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas.\"Harris, pg.\u00a0125\u201326 Under Noel, the band crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity, with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing barre chords and root bass notes, McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion. Oasis thus created a sound described as being \"so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable\".Harris, pg.\u00a0127\u201328", "thumb|left|upright=0.75|A promotional image of Oasis in 1997; from left to right: Alan White, Paul McGuigan, Noel Gallagher, Paul Arthurs, and Liam Gallagher", "* Paul Arthurs \u2013 rhythm guitar (1991\u20131999), keyboards (1993\u20131999), bass guitar (1995)"]}, {"page": "Liam Gallagher", "response": ["In March 2015, Gallagher appeared alongside Stephen Fry in a short film for Comic Relief titled National Treasures.
