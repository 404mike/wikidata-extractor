Coss is a British historian, specialising in the history of the English medieval gentry. He is Emeritus Professor of Medieval History at the School of History, Archaeology, and Religion at Cardiff University, Wales. His research interests also include 12th- to 15th-century English social history and Italian history from the same period, as well as visual history/social display and literature and history. As of 2008, he was working on a comparative project between the English gentry and the nobility of Tuscany, and another on the foundations of gentry culture. Coss studied under Rodney Hilton. He is a member of the historical journal Past & Present, and also a former member of the council of the Royal Historical Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Koss", "response": ["*Peter Coss, historian"]}, {"page": "Landed gentry", "response": ["The term landed gentry, although originally used to mean nobility, came to be used of the lesser nobility in England around 1540. Once identical, eventually nobility and landed gentry became complementary, in the sense that their definitions began to fill in parts of what the other lacked. The historical term gentry by itself, so Peter Coss argues, is a construct that historians have applied loosely to rather different societies. Any particular model may not fit a specific society, yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable. The phrase landed gentry referred in particular to the untitled members of the landowning upper class. The most stable and respected form of wealth has historically been land, and great prestige and political qualifications were (and to a lesser extent still are) attached to land ownership."]}, {"page": "Rodney Hilton", "response": ["His students included Peter Coss and Christopher Dyer."]}, {"page": "Gentry", "response": ["The term \"gentry\" by itself, so Peter Coss argues, is a construct that historians have applied loosely to rather different societies.

Any particular model may not fit a specific society, yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable... Titles, while often considered central to the upper class, are not strictly so. Both Captain Mark Phillips and Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, the respective first and second husbands of HRH Princess Anne, lacked any rank of peerage at the time of their marriage to Princess Anne. However, the  backgrounds of both men were considered to be essentially patrician, and they were thus deemed suitable husbands for a princess."]}, {"page": "Aveline de Forz, Countess of Aumale", "response": ["Aveline was buried in Westminster Abbey, the first tomb to be placed in its new church.

Abbot Walter spent much of his tenure defending the rights and prerogatives of his house (even, in 1302, securing the rights to all the dead wood on the ground within Peak Forest and at the same time petitioning parliament for the payment of arrears needed to pay for the ongoing works at the Abbey). The Abbey were granted the rights to hold a five-day long market and fair at their Kirkham manor in 1287. This was disputed by a member of the local gentry, Sir Theobald Butler, who claimed the hereditary grant of the church at Kirkham (and therefore all the associated rights and rents)  from the time of King Richard I. Walter also requested that the King inform the Justices of the Eyre to aid the Abbey in its enforcement of its previous royal charters and successfully proved his Abbey's rights to the Kirkham fair and market before a commission of Quo Warranto. Abbot Walter also, for good measure, obtained from Otton de Grandson\u2014the English Ambassador to St Peter's\u2014Papal confirmation that the advowson of Kirkham was vale Royal's in perpetuity. As Peter Coss has said, however, even \"the Abbey's own chronicler cast some doubt on the justice\" of the original grant. Abbot Walter was also able to hold back an armed force that tried to force its way through the Abbey precinct."]}, {"page": "Peter, Abbot of Vale Royal", "response": ["Notwithstanding these confirmations, Abbot Peter was summoned to appear before the Archbishop of York, to demonstrate under what grant or law Vale Royal held Kirkham. He attended the hearing armed with a great deal of written evidence (in the form of charters) and witnesses. The fact that the abbot was forced to publicly defend his rights to his superior may well be a reflection on weaknesses in the wording of the original grant. \"Even the Abbey's own chronicler,\" said historian Peter Coss \"cast some doubt on the justice\" of the grant. Although Shrewsbury's clam was for eight years' rents from Kirkham church (twelve marks annually), Peter was unable to obtain the dismissal of the suit (or other \"favourable termination\"). Although Peter managed to redeem \"that writ and many others\" from the Sheriff of Lancashire, Shrewsbury's case was not settled until after Peter's death."]}, {"page": "Coss (surname)", "response": ["*Peter Coss (born 1946), British historian"]}, {"page": "Coss, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Coss"]}]}}
