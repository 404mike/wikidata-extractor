Bustle noted that \"Lewis' role is one mostly of comedic relief\" but the actor \"plays the character's outrage perfectly\"; Lewis stated he was careful not to make the role a \"laughed-off villain, but a fully-formed character.\" That same year, Lewis reoccured in two BBC productions, crime dramas Ripper Street and Happy Valley. He starred alongside Niamh Cusack in the London premiere of Unfaithful, written by playwright Owen McCafferty, which ran from August to October 2016.
