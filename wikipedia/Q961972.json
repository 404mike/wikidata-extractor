There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be \"the real thing\", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud, Cited as reference 6 in  like Bower and Chorley and tabloid Today hoaxing Pat Delgado, the Wessex Sceptics and Channel 4's Equinox hoaxing Terence Meaden, or a friend of a Canadian farmer hoaxing a field researcher of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network. In his 1997 book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, Carl Sagan concludes that crop circles were created by Bower and Chorley and their copycats, and speculates that UFOlogists willingly ignore the evidence for hoaxing so they can keep believing in an extraterrestrial origin of the circles. Many others have demonstrated how complex crop circles can be created. Scientific American published an article by Matt Ridley, who started making crop circles in northern England in 1991. He wrote about how easy it is to develop techniques using simple tools that can easily fool later observers. He reported on \"expert\" sources such as The Wall Street Journal, who had been easily fooled and mused about why people want to believe supernatural explanations for phenomena that are not yet explained. Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the Internet."]}, {"page": "The Spectator", "response": ["*Matt Ridley"]}, {"page": "Magdalen College, Oxford", "response": ["More recent Magdalen alumni to become politicians include Malcolm Fraser, former Prime Minister of Australia, and John Turner, former Prime Minister of Canada.

As a result, there are many hereditary peers who have taken up careers which do not fit traditional conceptions of aristocracy.
