Many of these mythologies seem to date back to the 1920s and 1930s, when Cain's sons William Cain and Charles Nall-Cain were given titles in the British honours system, and centre on the idea that the brewery's founder had a background in the Irish gentry. Such a background would have made his sons more acceptable to the British establishment at the time. However, according to Routledge, Robert Cain was born in poverty in 1826, the son of a private soldier who would soon be forced to leave the army and travel to England to find work. Cain arrived in Liverpool with his parents in late 1827 or early 1828 and grew up in the slums of the Islington area of the city with his older sister Hannah and two younger siblings, Mary and William. When he was in his early teens Cain was indentured to a cooper on board a ship carrying palm oil from West Africa.", "Cain is also notable as an example of social mobility in Victorian and early twentieth-century Britain. From the early 1860s the Cains lived in the affluent enclave of Grassendale Park and later owned mansions on Aigburth Road and in Hoylake on the Wirral. In all the Cains had 11 children, including five sons and six daughters. Despite their Irish immigrant background two of his sons joined the British establishment. William Cain became a baronet while Charles Cain, later Charles Nall-Cain, entered the House of Lords in 1933 as the first Baron Brocket, joining several other brewers in what became known somewhat disparagingly as The Beerage. Both sons were noted philanthropists."]}, {"page": "William Cain", "response": ["William Cain may refer to:", "*William Cain (American politician) (1792\u20131878), lieutenant governor of South Carolina ", "*William Cain (mayor),  Mayor of Melbourne, Australia, in 1887", "*William Cain (Australian politician), one of the Members of the Victorian Legislative Council, 1902\u20131904", "*William Cain (sea captain) (1862\u20131932), Manx master mariner", "*Sir William Cain, 1st Baronet (1864\u20131924), English brewer and philanthropist", "*William Cain (cricketer) (1899\u20131981), Australian cricketer", "*William Cain (deemster) (1935\u20132021), Manx judge", "*William Caine (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "1917 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*William Cain."]}, {"page": "William Cain (brewer & philanthropist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir William Cain, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Bachelor appointed in 1917", "response": ["|William Cain"]}]}}
