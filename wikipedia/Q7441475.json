For the latter game, McCall had named a weakened team, which included debutants Ben Saynor and Sean Taylforth, and City faced a \u00a35,000 fine from The Football League, but were eventually only fined \u00a33,000.

Bullock made his loan permanent and signed an 18-month contract, and David Brown signed after impressing on a trial. Five players also left Valley Parade on loan deals during January, with Craig Bentham joining Farsley Celtic, Luke Medley joining Cambridge City, Sean Taylforth and Luke Morgan both going to Droylsden, and Simon Ainge joining Halifax Town. Goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts was also expected to leave but his transfer to Queens Park Rangers collapsed after the Home Office rejected his application for a work permit.", "On 29 April 2008, McCall announced the list of players he would be keeping and releasing at the end of the season. As well as Ricketts, who was unlikely to be given a new work permit, the first team players to be released were Darren Williams, Paul Evans, Tom Penford and Alex Rhodes. Craig Bentham, who had spent three months on loan at Farsley Celtic, and Scott Phelan, who had not featured since December, were also deemed surplus to requirements. Back-up goalkeepers Ben Saynor and Jamie Waite, neither of whom had played a first team league game, and youngsters David Brown, Luke Morgan and Damian Hopkins completed the list of 13\u00a0players to leave the club. Barry Conlon and Kyle Nix were the only first team regulars to be offered new contracts, along with juniors Luke Medley, Luke O'Brien and Sean Taylforth.", "City finished the season with a 2\u20131 defeat at Wycombe Wanderers, when Luke Medley scored a penalty on his first start for the club. McCall had made a number of changes to the side, after his decision to release 13\u00a0players, giving a debut to Sean Taylforth and also giving places to three of the released players.
