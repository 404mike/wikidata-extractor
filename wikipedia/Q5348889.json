He made his first-class debut in 1961, and served as deputy keeper to David Evans until the late 1960s, when he became the county's first-choice keeper, a position he held until 1982. He took a record 933 dismissals for his county. In 1970 he took 7 dismissals in an innings against Cambridge University, and he finished the season with 94 dismissals. However, the continued good form of Alan Knott and Bob Taylor kept him out of consideration for the Test team.\nIn 1968 he made the highest ever score by a Glamorgan keeper with 146 not out against Sussex. His most successful season with the bat was Glamorgan's championship season of 1969, when he scored 753 runs at an average of 31.37. Thereafter his batting gradually declined, and after 1975 he never averaged as high as 20 in a season. He retired after the 1983 season, at the age of 41.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pontarddulais", "response": ["*Eifion Jones, Glamorgan county cricketer"]}, {"page": "Alan Jones (cricketer, born 1938)", "response": ["Jones' brother, Eifion Jones, was Glamorgan's wicketkeeper for much of the period that Jones was the opening batsman, and his son Andrew played once in a List A match for Glamorgan.

For several seasons at the start of the 1960s, he was at or near the top of the wicketkeeping lists of dismissals with 79, 82 and then 89 dismissals in the seasons from 1961 to 1963. The 89 dismissals in 1963 set a new county record for Glamorgan, though it has since been surpassed by Eifion Jones, and made him the leading wicketkeeper of the year. As a right-handed batsman, he was very much a tail-ender, though in a county side that had more than its fair share of rabbits, with Don Shepherd, Jeff Jones and Ossie Wheatley in the team, he often batted higher than he might have done in other sides. He did not, though, pass 50 in any first-class innings.", "Injured for part of the 1964 season, Evans was replaced by Eifion Jones, but regained his place for three more seasons. Jones' better batting, though, saw him displace Evans as first choice from 1968, and though Evans was granted a benefit in 1969, he left first-class cricket at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Eifion", "response": ["*Eifion Jones (1925\u20132004), Welsh marine botanist", "*Eifion Jones (cricketer) (born 1942), Welsh cricketer"]}, {"page": "Laurence Champniss", "response": ["Champniss made his debut for Buckinghamshire in the 1971 Minor Counties Championship against Norfolk.
