It took time for a distinctly New Zealand literature to develop. The first printing press arrived in New Zealand in 1834, and the first book printed was a M\u0101ori translation of a catechism in 1830 by William Yate, Ko Te Katikihama III. Early New Zealand books were generally narratives of visits and travel to New Zealand, such as A Narrative of a Nine Months' Residence in New Zealand in 1827 (1832) by Augustus Earle or Station Life in New Zealand (1870) by Mary Anne Barker, or scientific works such as The New Zealanders Illustrated, a rare book by natural history artist George French Angas (1847) and A History of the Birds of New Zealand (1872) by ornithologist Walter Buller. Early expressions of New Zealand identity in literature included, notably, Old New Zealand by \"a Pakeha Maori\" (Frederick Edward Maning) and Erewhon by Samuel Butler, which drew on the author's experiences of living in Canterbury for five years."]}, {"page": "Nyala", "response": ["The lowland nyala or simply nyala (Tragelaphus angasii), is a spiral-horned antelope native to southern Africa (not to be confused with the endangered Mountain nyala living in the Bale region of Ethiopia). It is a species of the family Bovidae and genus Nyala, also considered to be in the genus Tragelaphus. It was first described in 1849 by George French Angas. The body length is , and it weighs . The coat is maroon or rufous brown in females and juveniles, but grows a dark brown or slate grey, often tinged with blue, in adult males. Females and young males have ten or more white stripes on their sides. Only males have horns,  long and yellow-tipped. It exhibits the highest sexual dimorphism among the spiral-horned antelopes.", "The nyala was first described by George French Angas, an English naturalist, in 1849. The scientific name of nyala is Tragelaphus angasii. The name angasii is attributed to Angas, who said that Mr. Gray had named this species after Angas' father, George Fife Angas, Esq. of South Australia. But, according to Article 50.1.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, this is insufficient to state Gray as the author. The name \"nyala\" is the Tsonga name for this antelope, which is likely the source of the English, along with Zulu \"inyala\".OED2 Its first known use was in 1899. The word has a Bantu origin, similar to the Venda word dz\u00ec-ny\u00e1l\u00e0 (nyala buck).", "Category:Taxa named by George French Angas"]}, {"page": "Pasture day moth", "response": ["The pasture day moth, Apina callisto, is a species in the moth family Noctuidae which is active during the day, as its common name implies, making it unlike most other noctuid species.
