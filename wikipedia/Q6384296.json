He was primarily a one-day cricketer, appearing in over twice as many List A cricket matches as first-class cricket.  He played as an all-rounder, but never reached his potential; during his time at Middlesex he made irregular appearances, and did not claim his first five-wicket haul in a match until his final year at the county in 2000.  His move to Somerset brought him some rewards: a more regular place in the team, and his maiden (and only) century.  His first-class opportunities became increasingly limited, and at the end of 2005, after not appearing all season, he turned down a contract extension and ended his professional cricket career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Nash (cricketer)", "response": ["Nash broke into the Middlesex second XI in the 1994 season, aged just 16.
