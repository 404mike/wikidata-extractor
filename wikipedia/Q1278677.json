He was awarded the Hawthornden Prize for literature in 1928 for his book Tarka the Otter.\nHe was born in London, and brought up in a semi-rural area where he developed his love of nature, and nature writing. He fought in World War I and, having witnessed the Christmas Truce and the devastation of trench warfare, he developed first a pacifist ideology, then Fascist sympathies. He moved to Devon after World War II and took up farming and writing; he wrote many other novels. He married twice.
