During this time, Kay was influenced by Native American and First Nation peoples and their philosophies; this led to the creation of \"When You Gonna Learn\", a song covering social issues. After he had it recorded, Kay fought with his producer, who took out half the lyrics and produced the song based on what was charting at the time. With the track restored to his preference, the experience helped Kay realise he \"wanted a proper live band with a proper live sound\". The band would be named \"Jamiroquai\", a portmanteau of the words \"jam\" and the name of a Native American confederacy, the Iroquois. He was signed to Acid Jazz Records in 1991 after he sent a demo tape of himself covering a song by the Brand New Heavies. Kay gradually gathered band members, including Wallis Buchanan, who played the didgeridoo. Kay's manager scouted keyboardist Toby Smith, who joined the group as Kay's songwriting partner. In 1992, Jamiroquai began their career by performing in the British club scene. They released \"When You Gonna Learn\" as their debut single, charting outside the UK Top 50 on its initial release. In the following year, Stuart Zender became the band's bassist by audition.", "Jamiroquai's music is generally termed acid jazz, funk, disco, soul, house, and R&B. Their sound has been described by J. D. Considine as having an \"anything-goes attitude, an approach that leaves the band open to anything\". Tom Moon wrote that the band \"embrac[es] old-school funk, Philly-soul strings, the crisp keyboard sounds of the '70s and even hints of jazz fusion\", blending these with \"agitated, aggressive dance rhythms to create an easygoing feel that looks both backward and forward\". Ben Sisario facetiously commented that Jay Kay and Toby Smith as songwriters, \"studied Innervisions-era [Stevie] Wonder carefully, and just about everything the group has recorded sounds like it could in fact have been played by [Wonder] himself.\"", "Kay is the primary songwriter of Jamiroquai. When composing, he sings melodies and beats for band members to transcribe to their instrumentation. The band relies on analog sounds, such as running keyboards through vintage effects pedals \"to get the warmth and the clarity of those instruments\". Parry Gettelman of The Orlando Sentinel described Kay's vocals as \"not identifiably male or female, black or white\". Other writers said Toby Smith's keyboard arrangements were \"psychedelic and soulful\", and compared Stuart Zender's bass playing to the work of Marcus Miller. Wallis Buchanan on didgeridoo was met with either praise or annoyance from critics.", "* Toby Smith \u2013 keyboards (died 2017)"]}, {"page": "October 29", "response": ["*  1970   \u2013 Toby Smith, English keyboardist and songwriter (d. 2017) "]}, {"page": "1970", "response": ["** Toby Smith, British musician (d. 2017)"]}, {"page": "Jay Kay", "response": ["Kay formed Jamiroquai in 1992.

Regarding how the track was written, Kay said in 2013: \"I have a very limited musical ability in terms of playing\", so he would sing the instruments as Smith would work out the chords. The two tracks would shape up the album, they follow up to the \"high-kicking\" funk track \"Hooked Up.\" With the fourth track \"If I Like It I Do It\" Kay said it reminded him of \"Harvest for the World\" by Isley Brothers. The former song's lyrics have been described as anarchist: \"The kids want the system breaking down/Not higher education/If it ain't no natural law/Then you can keep your regulations\". \"Music of the Mind\" is a laid-back Latin fusion track that takes inspiration from Flora Purim's song \"Moon Dreams\".", "*Toby Smith \u2013 keyboard, string arrangements, production"]}, {"page": "The Return of the Space Cowboy", "response": ["The seventh track, \"Mr. Moon\", is a love song with \"incredibly complex chord structure[s]\" about a girl whom Kay met at a rave but who eventually ended up with the band's keyboardist Toby Smith.
