She was born in Manchester but stayed at Cambridge for the vast majority of her professional life. Her specialties were protozoology and parasitology; early work with ciliate parasites, including the one responsible for blackhead disease in the domesticated turkey, lay the groundwork for her later research. While working towards her doctorate, Bishop studied parasitic amoebae and examined potential chemotherapies for the treatment of amoebic diseases including amoebic dysentery.\nHer best known work was a comprehensive study of Plasmodium, the malaria parasite, and investigation of various chemotherapies for the disease. Later she studied drug resistance in this parasite, research that proved valuable to the British military in World War II. She discovered the potential for cross-resistance in these parasites during that same period. Bishop also discovered the protozoan Pseudotrichomonas keilini and worked with Aedes aegypti, a malaria vector, as part of her research on the disease. Elected to the Royal Society in 1959, Bishop was the founder of the British Society for Parasitology and served on the World Health Organization's Malaria Committee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Ann Bishop (1899\u20131990), English biologist who specialized in protozoology and parasitology"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Ann Bishop||19/03/1959||19 December 1899 \u2013 7 May 1990 Parasitologist"]}, {"page": "List of British scientists", "response": ["* Ann Bishop (1899\u20131990), protozoologist and parasitologist"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Girton College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Ann Bishop"]}, {"page": "Ann Bishop", "response": ["Ann Bishop may refer to:", "* Ann Bishop (journalist) (1931\u20131997), US broadcast journalist", "* Ann Bishop (biologist) (1899\u20131990), protozoologist from Cambridge University and member of the Royal Society"]}, {"page": "Ann Bishop (scientist)", "response": ["#redirect Ann Bishop (biologist)"]}, {"page": "Index of women scientists articles", "response": ["*Ann Bishop (biologist)"]}, {"page": "Pseudotrichomonas keilini", "response": ["Pseudotrichomonas keilini is a species of excavates that was discovered by Ann Bishop in 1939."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1959", "response": ["*Ann Bishop"]}]}}
