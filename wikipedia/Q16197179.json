Wolverhampton Wanderers concentrated their efforts on playing long balls forward to their attackers, but according to Mike King of the Sandwell Evening Mail, they were met with \"an unflinching Aldershot defence\".  In the ninth minute, Bull struck a shot high over the Aldershot crossbar and two minutes later, Barry Powell's strike from distance was tipped away by Tony Lange, the Aldershot goalkeeper.  Just before the hour mark, Thompson shot high and off-target before Lange made another save, this time from a strike which took a deflection off Jon Purdie.   With nine minutes of the match remaining, Barnes scored for Aldershot to give them a 1\u20130 win, and a 3\u20130 aggregate victory, securing promotion to the Third Division.  After the final whistle, hundreds of Wolverhampton Wanderers supporters rushed on the 2,000 travelling Aldershot fans, attacking them and the police.  Ten officers and a police horse were injured in the riot while forty-two people, including one Aldershot supporter, were arrested."]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Jon Purdie", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jon Purdie", "| Jon Purdie", "| Jon Purdie", "| Jon Purdie"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["After a long season in which the sheer amount of cup fixtures ultimately affected Brentford's hopes of a finish in the Third Division play-offs, manager Steve Perryman saw fit to make only minor changes to his squad.Croxford, Lane & Waterman, p. 260.
