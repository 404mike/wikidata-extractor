Dickens authored a work called The Life of Our Lord (1846), a book about the life of Christ, written with the purpose of sharing his faith with his children and family.", "Dickens's novels were, among other things, works of social commentary. Simon Callow states, \"From the moment he started to write, he spoke for the people, and the people loved him for it.\" He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\"..
