Eyre resided in Market Drayton in Shropshire, which was outwith the jurisdiction of the court, so the indictment failed on that count. Barrister James Fitzjames Stephen travelled to Market Drayton but failed to convince the Justices to endorse his case against Eyre. The Jamaica Committee next asked the Attorney-General to certify the criminal information against Eyre but was rebuffed. Eyre then moved to London so that he might bring matters to a head and offer himself up to justice. The magistrate at Bow Street Police Court declined to arrest him, due to the failure of the cases against the soldiers, whereupon the imagined prosecutors applied to the Queen's Bench for a writ of mandamus justified by the Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1802 and succeeded. The Queen's Bench grand jury, upon presentation of the case against Eyre, declined to find a true bill of indictment, and Eyre was freed of criminal pursuit."]}, {"page": "Morant Bay rebellion", "response": ["In response, Governor John Eyre sent government troops, under Brigadier-General Alexander Nelson,\"Alexander Nelson\" at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. to hunt down the poorly armed rebels and bring Bogle back to Morant Bay for trial.
