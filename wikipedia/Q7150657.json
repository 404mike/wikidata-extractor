At the end of 1998 they were in the top six. By the end of April they were relegated. The season started well and 13 points from their September games saw them in third place just four points adrift of the leaders Nuneaton Borough. In November Gresley Rovers were drawn to meet Walsall at the Bescot Stadium in the first round of the FA Cup. Gresley went close to causing an upset but were denied at least a replay by a goal 11 minutes from the end. Victories over King's Lynn and Hastings Town got December off to a fine start; however, three defeats saw them drop to 6th place. After a disastrous run of 6 successive defeats in January saw them slump to 17th place just 5 points above the relegation places. In February two successive draws and three defeats proved to be Garry Birtles downfall and he and his assistant, Paul Fitzpatrick were dismissed. Stuart Ford took charge temporarily and saw the team beat Atherstone United 2\u20131 that ended a run of 14 games without a win. In March 1999 Brian Kenning was appointed manager. The opening game of April produced a comfortable 3\u20130 victory over Cambridge City. But three defeats followed against Nuneaton Borough, Crawley Town and Rothwell Town. Vital game at Dorchester Town and Salisbury City yielded only one point. The defeat on the final day against Bath City pushed Gresley into the Midlands Division just two years after winning the Southern League Premier Division Championship by 11 points. The last time Gresley were relegated was in the 1958\u201359 season when they went down from the Birmingham League Division one to Division two."]}, {"page": "Lombo Pocket Watch", "response": ["|Graeme Tindale,Paul Fitzpatrick", "Lombo Pocket Watch is a champion Australian grey Standardbred colt foaled on 16 October 2003.
