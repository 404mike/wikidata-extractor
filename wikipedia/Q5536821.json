Prior to the Second World War, while Beamish was in the RAF, he was a keen rugby union player, playing for Leicester and being capped 26 times for Ireland and was selected for the 1930 British Lions tour.

This was the tour to New Zealand where the tourists' now standard blue jerseys caused some controversy. The convention in rugby is for the home side to accommodate its guests when there is a clash of kit. The New Zealand side, by then already synonymous with the appellation \"All Blacks\", had an all black kit that clashed with the Lions' blue. After much reluctance and debate New Zealand agreed to change for the Tests and New Zealand played in all white for the first time. On the 1930 tour a delegation led by the Irish lock George Beamish expressed their displeasure at the fact that while the blue of Scotland, white of England and red of Wales were represented in the strip there was no green for Ireland. A green flash was added to the socks, which from 1938 became a green turnover (although on blue socks thus eliminating red from the kit), and that has remained a feature of the strip ever since.Richard Bath, The British & Irish Lions Miscellany, page 77, 2008, (Vision Sports Publishing:London) In 1936, the four-quartered badge returned for the tour to Argentina and has remained on the kits ever since, but other than that the strip remained the same."]}, {"page": "1905", "response": ["* April 29 \u2013 George Beamish, British Royal Air Force air marshal, Irish rugby player (d. 1967)"]}, {"page": "Battle of Crete", "response": ["No RAF units were based permanently at Crete until April 1941, but airfield construction had begun, radar sites built and stores delivered. Equipment was scarce in the Mediterranean and in the backwater of Crete. The British forces had seven commanders in seven months. In early April, airfields at Maleme and Heraklion and the landing strip at Rethymno on the north coast were ready and another strip at Pediada-Kastelli was nearly finished. After the German invasion of Greece, the role of the Crete garrison changed from the defence of a naval anchorage to preparing to repel an invasion. On 17 April, Group Captain George Beamish was appointed Senior Air Officer, Crete, taking over from a flight-lieutenant whose duties and instructions had been only vaguely defined. Beamish was ordered to prepare the reception of the Bristol Blenheim bombers of 30 and 203 Squadrons from Egypt and the remaining fighter aircraft from Greece, to cover the evacuation of W Force, which enabled the transfer of  and Dominion troops to the island, preparatory to their relief by fresh troops from Egypt."]}, {"page": "Beamish", "response": ["*Sir George Beamish (1905\u20131967), British air marshal and Irish rugby player"]}, {"page": "Leicester Tigers", "response": ["1930: Doug Prentice, George Beamish, Joe Kendrew", "* George Beamish (Ireland, 1932, 4 tests)", "|Lock || || George Beamish|| 118 games 1924\u201333"]}, {"page": "Dunmanway", "response": ["*George Beamish, rugby player for Ireland and the British and Irish Lions in the 1920s and 1930s"]}, {"page": "List of sportsperson-politicians", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Beamish, George\"| George Beamish || Rugby union (1930 British Lions tour) || High Sheriff of County Londonderry (1962)"]}, {"page": "List of Ireland national rugby union players", "response": ["|George Beamish"]}]}}
