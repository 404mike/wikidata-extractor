The album was not as commercially successful as the previous two albums, peaking at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart.

According to Craig Tomashoff and David Hiltbrand of Picks and Pans, the album contains \"sweet pop music with insidious lyrics. It starts with the best pop melodies you can hum\u2014sort of like Elton John Does Detroit.

Until you actually listen to what Heaton and his two co-lead vocalists, Dave Hemingway and Briana Corrigan, are saying. The tunes suggest light, happy odes to love. The words are dark, sardonic musings on human nature.\"", "The album was released to positive reviews. Ted Kessler of Select gave the album a perfect five out of five score, saying \"under a veneer of polished pop production The Beautiful South are contrary, twisted mavericks, and 0898 is the bright, acceptable face of the foul beast AOR \u2013 and their best work to date\".

It is often seen as indicating a personal distaste for Springsteen, but McAloon elaborated on the lyrics in a 1992 interview; \"The point of the parody is this: not that I think Bruce Springsteen is crap, it's that I think a lot of his audience get into him on a patriotic level that he doesn't intend. They misinterpret him, their enjoyment of him is inaccurate, all very imperialist American.
