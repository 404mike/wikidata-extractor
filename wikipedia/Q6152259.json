Examples of such novels in which the Green Man is a central character are Bel Mooney's 1997 works The Green Man and Joining the Rainbow, Jane Gardam's 1998 The Green Man, and Geraldine McCaughrean's 1998 The Stones are Hatching. Within many of these depictions, the Green Man figure absorbs and supplants a variety of other wild men and gods, in particular those which are associated with a seasonal death and rebirth. The Rotherweird Trilogy by Andrew Caldecott draws heavily on the concept of the Green Man, embodied by the Gardener Hayman Salt who is transformed into the Green Man at the climax of the first book. The Deptford Mice books by Robin Jarvis feature a benevolent deity known as the Green Mouse, worshiped by the protagonists. He is a rodent version of the Green Man."]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Jane Gardam OBE"]}, {"page": "1981 Whitbread Awards", "response": ["*Jane Gardam, The Hollow Land"]}, {"page": "1991 Whitbread Awards", "response": ["*Jane Gardam, The Queen of the Tambourine"]}, {"page": "Bedford College, London", "response": ["*Jane Gardam (born 1928), English novelist and children's writer"]}, {"page": "Tim Gardam", "response": ["Gardam was born on 14 January 1956 to the novelist Jane Gardam.
