Michael Billington, reviewer for The Guardian, remarked that \"Suranne Jones captures excellently the hidden regrets of the go-getting Marlene\". The production was later transferred to the West End's Trafalgar Studios. In August 2011, it was announced that Jones would star alongside John Hannah in a spoof detective drama written by Charlie Brooker and Daniel Maier called A Touch of Cloth. The programme aired in August 2012 on Sky1. Jones plays DC Anne Oldman, the \"plucky, no-nonsense sidekick\" of DCI Jack Cloth (Hannah). In March 2012, Jones began filming The Secret of Crickley Hall, a BBC1 dramatisation of the 2006 best selling novel by James Herbert. She plays the lead role of Eve Caleigh, a woman who moves to Crickley Hall in an attempt to move on from the loss of her son, only to be haunted by supernatural occurrences. Jones described the series as a \"classic haunted house spine-chiller with an emotional family story at its heart.\" Jones returned to the London stage in 2013 in a 20th anniversary revival of Jonathan Harvey's play, Beautiful Thing. The play ran between 13 April and 25 May at the Arts Theatre, London, before a short national tour. In 2013 Jones starred as herself in Playhouse Presents: \"Stage Door Johnnies\", a comedy mockumentary about obsessive theatre fans airing on Sky Arts. Later that year, Jones played a young judge \"battling to keep her head above water in the murky depths of the justice system\" in Lawless, a television pilot, broadcast on Sky1 as part of its Drama Matters strand."]}, {"page": "Charlie Brooker", "response": ["With Daniel Maier, he co-wrote a spoof crime drama for Sky1 called A Touch of Cloth, which first broadcast on 26 August 2012 and starred John Hannah and Suranne Jones, both notable for having starred in genuine crime dramas.A Touch of Cloth Two further series were broadcast in 2013 and 2014, with the latter starring Karen Gillan."]}, {"page": "Harry Hill's TV Burp", "response": ["Following a successful pilot broadcast on 22 December 2001, a series was commissioned, starting on 14 November 2002. Production of an episode often involved Hill and his programme's associate writing team, including Brenda Gilhooly, Paul Hawksbee, Daniel Maier, Joe Burnside, David Quantick and Madeleine Brettingham, watching significant amounts of television, much on preview tapes. Throughout Series 1 to 9, the show was recorded before a live audience in Studio 1 of Teddington Studios, South-West London, but from Series 10 to the final episode of Series 15, recording was relocated to BBC Television Centre in Studio 4. The first two series of the show were broadcast within a late night slot on Thursdays, with Series 1 being the only series not to feature clips from the BBC's EastEnders; Hill was required, during the series, to accompany his comments on the British soap with either crude animation, courtroom-style sketches or staged comic re-enactments of scenes from the show. Whilst the show was well received, the scheduling was criticised due to the family-friendly humour, leading to the third series receiving a teatime repeat slot on Sundays. Starting from the fourth series, the show moved to a Saturday teatime slot, and then later to a Saturday primetime slot."]}, {"page": "The Sitcom Trials", "response": ["Judges at the 2009 10th Anniversary Sitcom Trials in London included David Quantick, Iain Morris, Bill Dare, Katie Tyrell, David Schneider, Laura Lawson, Ashley Blaker, Daniel Maier, Nev Fountain, Carrie Quinlan, Michelle Farr, Marc Blake and Tom Price.."]}, {"page": "The Loves", "response": ["Their third album, Three, (also released on Fortuna Pop) featured guest appearances from Rob Jones aka The Voluntary Butler Scheme, Delia Sparrow, Hefner's Darren Hayman and Harry Hill's TV Burp writer Daniel Maier.
