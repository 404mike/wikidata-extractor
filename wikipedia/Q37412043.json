Feminist scientists, including Cordelia Fine, neuroscientist Gina Rippon, and Lise Eliot have opposed his extreme male brain theory of autism, calling it \"neurotrash\" and neurosexism.

To my knowledge, however, Cordelia Fine and Gina Rippon have not contributed any articles to any of the major handbooks or volumes about evolutionary psychology (such as The Adapted Mind, the first edition of The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology edited by David Buss or the first or second volume of the second edition of that handbook, or The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology edited by Louise Barrett and Robin Dunbar), have sat on or currently sit on the editorial board of the journal Evolutionary Psychology, or currently work at any research center associated with any of the other researchers on this list. Additionally, according to Fine's and Rippon's Wikipedia pages their views about sex differences in psychology are in contrast with this field (see the evolutionary psychology page sections about mating and parenting).

They claim that many researchers who make claims about gendered brain differences fail to provide sufficient warrant for their position. Philosophers of science who believe in a value-free normative standard for science find the practice of neurosexism particularly problematic. They hold that science should be free from values and biases, and argue that only epistemic values have a legitimate role to play in scientific inquiry. However, contrary to the value-free ideal view, Heather Douglas argues that 'value-free science is inadequate science'", "According to Cordelia Fine and Gina Rippon, there are systematic methodological issues in the neuroscience of sex differences that increase the chances of neurosexism.
