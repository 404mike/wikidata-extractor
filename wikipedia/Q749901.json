Five of Brazil's six games at the tournament were played at Maracan\u00e3 (the exception being their 2\u20132 draw with Switzerland in S\u00e3o Paulo). Eventually, Brazil progressed to the final round, facing Uruguay in the match (part of a round-robin final phase) that turned out to be the tournament-deciding match on 16 July 1950. Brazil only needed a draw to finish as champion, but Uruguay won the game 2\u20131, shocking and silencing the massive crowd. This defeat on home soil instantly became a significant event in Brazilian history, being known popularly as the Maracanazo. The official attendance of the final game was 199,854, with the actual attendance estimated to be about 210,000.  In any case, it was the largest crowd ever to see a football game\u2014a record that is highly unlikely to be threatened in an era when most international matches are played in all-seater stadiums.
