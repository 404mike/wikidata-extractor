Smith's training stables were located at Bishop Auckland in County Durham. He trained the winners of over 1,600 races during a 45-year career and gained his biggest success when Red Alligator won the 1968 Grand National.Smith worked as a taxi driver before his joining his father-in-law, Bert Richardson, as a cattle dealer. Richardson owned horses which took part in harness racing and Smith assisted him with buying horses and training them before moving on to training point-to-point horses. He eventually became a fully licensed trainer himself and sent out his first winner in 1958 with Owen's Mark at Sedgefield Racecourse. His first Flat race winner came in 1964 when Miss Autumn won at Aintree Racecourse. In 1969\u201370 and 1970 Smith became the first trainer to send out 50 winners in consecutive National Hunt and Flat seasons. He retired from training in 2002 and had his final winner with Monksford at Hamilton Park Racecourse in July of that year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Middle Park Stakes", "response": ["| Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "Flying Childers Stakes", "response": ["| Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "Denford Stakes", "response": ["| Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "Supreme Novices' Hurdle", "response": ["| Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "Fighting Fifth Hurdle", "response": ["| Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "Denys", "response": ["* Denys Smith (1924\u20132016), British racehorse trainer"]}, {"page": "Gordon Stakes", "response": ["| Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "British jump racing Champion Trainer", "response": ["* 1967\u201368 - Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "Lincoln Handicap", "response": ["| Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "1990 Epsom Derby", "response": ["| Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "Stardom Stakes", "response": ["| Denys Smith"]}, {"page": "Joe Mercer (jockey)", "response": ["In the article with Powell Mercer mentioned that he had never phoned around for rides, and even in pursuing his first title he had refused to but that many trainers were calling him.
