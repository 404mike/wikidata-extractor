He was born in Uig, Lewis, but grew up on Raasay, and took an active interest in Gaelic tradition while still young and made a conscious effort to seek it out amongst his family and community.In 1948, John MacInnes went to study at the University of Edinburgh and was awarded a scholarship in Gaelic established by the Church of Scotland. In 1958, MacInnes was appointed to a Junior Research Fellowship in the School of Scottish Studies and spent years conducting fieldwork amongst Gaelic speakers in Scotland and in Nova Scotia, Canada. MacInnes formally retired from the School of Scottish Studies in 1993.\nJohn MacInnes penned a significant body of seminal articles on aspects of Scottish Gaelic linguistics, folklore, oral narrative, song, dance, history and indigenous beliefs which continue to inform contemporary scholarship. A thorough bibliography and selection of these essays was published as D\u00f9thchas nan G\u00e0idheal. A special issue of the journal Scottish Studies contains biographical information and a range of articles celebrating and extending MacInnes\u2019 intellectual and cultural legacy.In 2015, John MacInnes was recognised with the 'Services to Gaelic' Award by The Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame, and received the award for 'Best Contribution' from the Daily Record and B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig Scottish Gaelic Awards in the same year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sorley MacLean", "response": ["MacLean later said that he had abandoned religion for socialism at the age of twelve, as he refused to accept that a majority of human beings were consigned to eternal damnation. In 1941, he wrote that \"perhaps my obsession with the cause of the unhappy, the unsuccessful, the oppressed comes from this.\" The pessimism of the Calvinist tradition had a strong impact on his world-view, and he also retained \"a puritanical contempt for mere worldly riches and power\". Later in life, he had a complicated view of the church and religion. Although he criticized the church's suppression of Gaelic song and the oral tradition and the negative effect of church teachings on some social groups, especially women, Professor Donald Meek (gd) wrote that at times MacLean seemed to articulate the ideas of liberation theology. John MacInnes has argued that his evangelical Presbyterian background was an important influence on his choice of Gaelic as the medium for his poetry and the manner of its expression.MacInnes, John (1981), A Radically Traditional Voice: Sorley MacLean and the Evangelical Background, in Murray, Glen (ed.), Cencrastus No. 7, Winter 1981 - 82, pp. 14 - 17 . MacLean defended the Free Presbyterian Church against opponents who had little familiarity with it, once describing Free Presbyterian elders as \"saintly, just saintly men\". Sometimes he altered his poetry to avoid offending the religious members of his family. He also admired the literary sophistication and creativity of Protestant sermons in Gaelic. The wide vocabulary, high register, and passion of these sermons had a significant impact on his poetic style.", "MacLean's work was innovative and influential because it juxtaposed elements from Gaelic history and tradition with icons from mainstream European history. He described his poetry as \"radiating from Skye and the West Highlands to the whole of Europe\". By this juxtaposition, he implicitly asserted the value of the Gaelic tradition and the right of Gaels to participate as equals in the broader cultural landscape. According to John MacInnes, MacLean put the much-denigrated Gaelic language and tradition in its proper place, which has a profound effect on Gaelic-speaking readers and is fundamental to their reading of his poetry. An Cuilthionn, the mountains of Skye are used as a synecdoche for rifts in European politics, and the suffering of the Gaels due to the Highland Clearances is compared to the suffering of European people under Francoism and other fascist regimes. MacLean frequently compared the injustice of the Highland Clearances with modern-day issues; in his opinion, the greed of the wealthy and powerful was responsible for many tragedies and social problems.", "According to John MacInnes, MacLean's poetry \"exhibits virtually an entire spectrum of language\". Some of his poetry is transparent to a fluent Gaelic speaker, but the meaning of other poems needs to be untangled. MacLean coined very few neologisms; however, he revived or repurposed many obscure or archaic words. MacLean often said that he had heard these old words in Presbyterian sermons. According to MacInnes and Maoilios Caimbeul, MacLean's revival of these old, forgotten Gaelic words revolutionized literary Gaelic, by adding senses and a newness and modernity. Caimbeul wrote that MacLean's vocabulary is not \"simple\", but it is \"natural\" and arises naturally from everyday speech, although mixed with other influences.", "Hugh MacDiarmid wrote a letter to MacLean in 1977, a year before his death, stating that he and MacLean were the best Scottish poets of the twentieth century. MacDiarmid and MacLean influenced each other's work and maintained an extensive correspondence which has been published. Douglas Young wrote that \"the best poetry written in our generation in the British Isles has been in Scottish Gaelic, by Sorley MacLean.\" John MacInnes called him a \"magisterial writer\" who \"[pushed] Gaelic to its limits\". He said that it is \"truly astonishing\" that Gaelic, so long minoritized, could have produced a writer like MacLean, who could not express what he had to say in any other language: \"Somhairle MacGill-Eain needed Gaelic, and Gaelic needed Somhairle MacGill-Eain\". According to Iain Crichton Smith, translator of MacLean's poetry, D\u00e0in do Eimhir was \"the greatest Gaelic book of this century\", an assessment with which Christopher Whyte agreed. According to Maoilios Caimbeul, MacLean was the best Scottish Gaelic poet of all time. Smith compared the calibre of MacLean's love poetry to that of Catallus and William Butler Yeats. Nobel Prize Laureate Seamus Heaney said that MacLean had \"saved Gaelic poetry... for all time\".", "* John MacInnes (1975), Sorley Maclean's \"Hallaig\": a note, in Burnett, Ray (ed.), Calgacus 2, Summer 1975, pp. 29 - 32, "]}, {"page": "John McInnes", "response": ["*John MacInnes (Gaelic scholar) (1930\u20132019), Scottish Gaelic scholar", "*John MacInnes (writer) (born 1969), writer for the game Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare in 2014", "*John MacInnes (1925\u20131983), Canadian ice hockey player and coach"]}, {"page": "John MacInnes Gaelic scholar", "response": ["#REDIRECT John MacInnes (Gaelic scholar)"]}, {"page": "2019 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**John MacInnes, 89, Scottish Gaelic scholar."]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2019", "response": ["*John MacInnes, 89, Scottish Gaelic scholar.Scotland loses \u201cintellectual giant\u201d after death of top Gaelic scholar"]}]}}
