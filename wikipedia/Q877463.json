He was director-general of the BBC from 1960 to 1969.\nAfter working for newspapers in the 1930s, Greene spent most of his later career with the BBC, rising through the managerial ranks of overseas broadcasting and then news for the main domestic channels. He encountered opposition from some politicians and activists opposed to his modernising agenda, but under his leadership the BBC was recognised to be outperforming its commercial rival, ITV, and was awarded a second television channel (BBC 2) by the British government and authorised to introduce colour television to Britain.\nAfter retiring from the BBC, Greene published several books,  including a collaboration with his brother, the novelist Graham Greene, and made television programmes both for the BBC and its commercial rival.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Round the Horne", "response": ["The show was the successor to Beyond Our Ken, which had run from 1958 to 1964 with largely the same cast. By the time the new series began, television had become the dominant broadcasting medium in Britain, and Round the Horne, which built up a regular audience of 15 million, was the last radio show to reach so many listeners. Horne was surrounded by larger-than-life characters including the camp pair Julian and Sandy, the disreputable eccentric J.Peasmold Gruntfuttock, and the singer of dubious folk songs, Rambling Syd Rumpo, who all became nationally familiar. The show encountered periodic scrutiny from the BBC management for its double entendres, but consistently received the backing of the director-general of the BBC, Sir Hugh Greene. Horne died suddenly in 1969; the BBC decided that Round the Horne could not continue without its star and they cancelled plans for a fifth series that year.", "Further complaints about the programme were received and Sir Hugh Greene, the director-general of the BBC, asked to see the scripts before broadcasting. All were returned with the words \"I see nothing to object to in this\" written on them. The complaints continued from Black, and from Mary Whitehouse \u2013 a campaigner against social liberalism \u2013 about the cast putting emphasis on certain words. Took replied that \"When Laurence Olivier plays Hamlet he puts emphasis on certain words \u2013 it's called acting\"."]}, {"page": "Kristallnacht", "response": ["The Daily Telegraph correspondent, Hugh Greene, wrote of events in Berlin:"]}, {"page": "That Was the Week That Was", "response": ["The programme was not party political but did not treat all issues with what the producers considered to be a false level of impartiality and balance; one example of this is the issue of racism and \"the evils of apartheid\", following the view of BBC Director-General Sir Hugh Greene that the BBC should not be bound by its charter to be impartial on issues of racism, which Greene and the producers of TW3 viewed as \"quite simply wrong\". Following the 1963 murder of 35-year-old white postal worker William Lewis Moore in Alabama, who was on a protest march against segregation in the American South, TW3 Millicent Martin dressed as Uncle Sam sang a parody of \"I Wanna Go Back to Mississippi\" (\"... where the Mississippi mud/kinda mingles with the blood/of the niggers who are hanging from the branches of the tree ...\") accompanied by minstrel singers in blackface (\"... we hate all the darkies and the Catholics and the Jews / Where we welcome any man / Who is white and strong and belongs to the Ku Klux Klan\"), thus parodying The Black and White Minstrel Show, which was then being shown on the BBC despite accusations of racism over its use of blackface.", "Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was initially supportive of the programme, chastising Postmaster General Reginald Bevins for threatening to \"do something about it\". However, the BBC received many complaints from organisations and establishment figures. Lord Aldington, vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, wrote to BBC director-general Hugh Greene that Frost had a hatred of the prime minister which \"he finds impossible to control\". The programme also attracted complaints from the Boy Scout Association about an item questioning the sexuality of its founder Lord Baden-Powell, and from the government of Cyprus which claimed that a joke about their ruler Archbishop Makarios was a \"gross violation of internationally accepted ethics\"."]}]}}
