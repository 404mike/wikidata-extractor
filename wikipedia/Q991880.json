The group was obliged to change its name to \"The Shadows\" after legal complications with the American group the Drifters as \"Living Doll\" entered the American top 40, licensed by ABC-Paramount. \"Living Doll\" was used in Richard's d\u00e9but film Serious Charge, but it was arranged as a country standard, rather than a rock and roll standard.", "In 1976, the decision was made to repackage Richard as a rock artist. That year, Bruce Welch relaunched Cliff's career and produced the landmark album I'm Nearly Famous, which included the successful but controversial guitar-driven track \"Devil Woman\", which became Richard's first true hit in the United States, and the ballad \"Miss You Nights\". In reviewing the new album in Melody Maker, Geoff Brown heralded it the renaissance of Richard. Richard's fans were excited about this revival of a performer who had been a part of British rock from its early days. Many music names such as Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and Elton John were seen sporting I'm Nearly Famous badges, pleased that their boyhood idol was getting back into the heavier rock, in which he had begun his career.", "In 1979, Richard teamed up once again with producer Bruce Welch for the pop hit single \"We Don't Talk Anymore\", written and composed by Alan Tarney, which hit No. 1 in the UK and No. 7 in the US. Bryan Ferry added hummed backing vocals to the song. The record made Richard the first act to reach the Hot 100's top 40 in the 1980s who had also been there in each of the three previous decades. The song was quickly added onto the end of his latest album Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile, which was re-titled We Don't Talk Anymore for its release in the United States. It was his first time at the top of the UK singles chart in over ten years, and the song would become his biggest-selling single worldwide, selling almost five million copies throughout the world.
