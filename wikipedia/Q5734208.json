He first gained employment as an office boy at Manchester Town Hall, and worked for many years in local government. He studied economics and political history at the Co-operative College, Holyoake House.\nAt the 1929 general election he was nominated as the Labour and Co-operative candidate for the Mossley constituency and successfully unseated the sitting MP, Austin Hopkinson.
