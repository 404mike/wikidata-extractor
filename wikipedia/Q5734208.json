He first gained employment as an office boy at Manchester Town Hall, and worked for many years in local government. He studied economics and political history at the Co-operative College, Holyoake House.\nAt the 1929 general election he was nominated as the Labour and Co-operative candidate for the Mossley constituency and successfully unseated the sitting MP, Austin Hopkinson. His membership of parliament was short-lived, and Hopkinson regained the seat at the next election in 1931.\nGibson continued his involvement with co-operatives, becoming a director of the Co-operative Wholesale Society in 1936, at the same time leaving the employment of the local council. He subsequently held the post of chairman of the English and Scottish Joint Co-operative Society, was a director of the Manchester Ship Canal Company. He was appointed a member of the Joint Industrial Council of the Soap, Candle and Edible Fats Industries and a director of the Colonial Development Corporation. He died in March 1954 aged 58.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denton, Greater Manchester", "response": ["| Herbert Gibson"]}, {"page": "Austin Hopkinson", "response": ["By the late 1920s, Hopkinson was expressing the hope that Stanley Baldwin would be elected as a free trader in order to save the country from David Lloyd George who had left the country open to socialism \"and its twin brother, protection\".
