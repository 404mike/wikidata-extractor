The new crossing was opened on 15 June 1874 by the Governor of Queensland, George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby who gave it the name \"Victoria Bridge\", and was an iron structure and a toll bridge. The bridge was paid for by significant council borrowings that were to be recouped by tolls. However a lack of revenue and widespread community objections to the tolls forced its transfer to the Colonial Government. The tolls were abolished at this time. The bridge included a turning span to allow tall-masted river traffic to pass upstream.  A condition of the original Bridge Act was that the bridge  \"would not obstruct the navigation of the river Brisbane by sea-going vessels\". Over time, the swing was little used and subsequently water and gas pipes were laid across it. After the Council lost a court action in 1885 brought by a ship owner when it refused to operate the swing, the Government swiftly passed legislation fixing the bridge. The next year,  tram-lines were laid along the bridge. It carried a  and a  diameter pipe which supplied mains water to South Brisbane. This bridge was partially washed away in the 1893 Brisbane flood. In the meantime, ferries were used to transport people and goods across the busy river. This, however, led to the capsize of the ferry \u2018\u2019Pearl\u2019\u2019 disaster in 1896 with the loss of more than 40 lives. A temporary wooden structure was built covering the collapsed section of the old bridge while the new bridge was being built."]}, {"page": "1863 in Canada", "response": ["*Governor of Nova Scotia \u2014 George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby"]}, {"page": "1862 in Canada", "response": ["*Governor of Nova Scotia \u2014 George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby"]}, {"page": "1861 in Canada", "response": ["*Governor of Nova Scotia \u2014 George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby"]}, {"page": "1860 in Canada", "response": ["*Governor of Nova Scotia \u2014 George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby"]}, {"page": "1858 in Canada", "response": ["*Governor of Nova Scotia \u2014 George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby"]}, {"page": "1859 in Canada", "response": ["*Governor of Nova Scotia \u2014 George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby"]}]}}
