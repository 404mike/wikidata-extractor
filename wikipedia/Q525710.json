Mellor, \"The Rights of Woman and the women writers of Wollstonecraft's day\" in The Cambridge Companion to Mary Wollstonecraft. Romantic heroines, Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes, \"represent woman constructed for man: the heroic feminine victim of the courtly rake and gallant, the virtuous feminine companion of the ideal professionalized gentleman, and the intellectually and erotically subservient companion of the ideal bourgeois man\".Kelly, Revolutionary Feminism, 42. Wollstonecraft would also attack Rousseau in her best-known work, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, because of his sexism in the second part of Emile. She announces in the \"Advertisement\" (a section similar to a preface) of Mary that she is offering her heroine, who is a \"genius\", as a contrast to characters such as Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and Rousseau's Sophie.Kelly, Revolutionary Feminism, 42; see also Wollstonecraft, Mary (Kelly), 1. In addition the text is peppered with allusions to popular sentimental novels such as The History of Eliza Warwick (1778) and The Platonic Marriage (1787), which critique their presentation of the heroine of feminine sensibility. Mary is more akin to the charitable and industrious heroines of Bluestocking Sarah Scott's Millenium Hall (1762) than to the passive, weepy heroines found in most sentimental novels.Kelly, Revolutionary Feminism, 50.

Strangely, perhaps, only Hays, Jebb and Smith shared political sympathies with Wollstonecraft, and Smith, by 1798, had turned her back on her previous ideas. The others, though, in different ways, all fell afoul of restrictive ideas of female (and class) decorum.
