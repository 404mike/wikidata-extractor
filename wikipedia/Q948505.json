He is also a television and radio pundit. In a managerial career spanning five decades, Warnock has managed sixteen different clubs from the Premier League to non-league. He holds the record for the most promotions in English football, with eight.\nWarnock played as a winger for Chesterfield, Rotherham United, Hartlepool United, Scunthorpe United, Aldershot, Barnsley, York City and Crewe Alexandra, scoring 36 goals in 327 career league appearances. He retired in 1979 at age 30 to move into coaching.\nWarnock's first managerial job was with non-League Gainsborough Trinity (1980\u20131981), he would subsequently manage Burton Albion (1981\u20131986) and Scarborough (1986\u20131989), winning promotion to the Football League with the latter in 1987. He then managed Notts County (1989\u20131993), leading them from the Third Division to the First Division in successive seasons, though he was sacked after the club were relegated the season before the First Division became the Premier League. After a brief spell at Torquay United (1993), he moved to Huddersfield Town (1993\u20131995), with whom he won promotion to the new First Division. He then resigned and joined Plymouth Argyle (1995\u20131997), leading them to the Second Division. After being sacked, he spent spells with Oldham Athletic (1997\u20131998) and Bury (1998\u20131999).\nIn 1999, Warnock joined boyhood club Sheffield United, leading them to the semi-finals of the League Cup and FA Cup in 2003 and promotion to the Premier League in 2006. However, he resigned in 2007 after the club were relegated. He then took over at Crystal Palace (2007\u20132010), saving the club from relegation to League One. When the club went into administration, he left to join Queens Park Rangers (2010\u20132012), winning promotion to the Premier League with the club in 2011. He was sacked with the club in a precarious position and joined Leeds United (2012\u20132013). After being sacked by Leeds following a poor run of form, he was without a club for almost fifteen months until returning to Crystal Palace, then in the Premier League, in August 2014. In December 2014, he was sacked by Crystal Palace after a poor start to the season, which saw the club in the relegation zone. After a month as caretaker at Queens Park Rangers, Warnock returned to Rotherham United as manager in February 2016. He was appointed manager of Cardiff City in October 2016, and led them to Premier League promotion during the 2017\u201318 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 1", "response": ["*  1948   \u2013 Neil Warnock, English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "History of Wikipedia", "response": ["* In January 2004, Wikipedia reached the 200,000-article milestone in English with the article on Neil Warnock, and reached 450,000  articles for both English and non-English Wikipedias.

This was to become a recurring theme and replacement Steve Bruce would leave after only one season citing the same reasons. Adrian Heath then proved a disastrous appointment and lasted only six months before being sacked with United looking more likely to be relegated than promoted.
