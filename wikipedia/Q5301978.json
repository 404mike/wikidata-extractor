One villager, falsely accused of murder was killed on the spot. Four villagers were hanged and others punished by jail sentences, hard labour and lashings. The Denshawai Incident proved a turning point in the history of the British occupation of Egypt, starting a fierce political debate both in Egypt and Britain in which intellectuals and men of letters participated, eventually causing the resignation of Lord Cromer, the redoubtable British Consul General and de facto ruler of Egypt since 1882. Crucially poet Wilfred Scawen Blunt exposed the facts in his pamphlet Atrocities of Justice Under British Rule in Egypt, provoking a public outcry in Britain. George Bernard Shaw drafted a petition published in The New Age with the main purpose of gaining the release of the Egyptian prisoners. Shaw denounces the \"Denshawai horror\" in his Preface to Politicians that introduces his John Bull's Other Island. Caine's literary response to the debate is his controversial novel The White Prophet. Shaw reviews The White Prophet and opposes literary censorship in Bernard Shaw on Shams of Rule and of Religion. Set in Egypt at the start of the twentieth century, twenty years into the British occupation and opening with a ceremonial re-enactment of the Battle of Omdurman, The White Prophet is the story of Colonel Charles George Lord, a British officer who joins the crusade of Ishmael Ameer, a Muslim prophet against selfishness and sedition. Lord compares him with Christ and John the Baptist. Ameer plans a coup against the British in Sudan, after developing political ambitions.  The White Prophet is Caine's only book never to have been reprinted; its sympathies for Egyptian nationalism rendered it a commercial failure. Caine used material from Mahomet and The Mahdi in the novel.  Accompanied by his wife, he made three research visits to Egypt, March to May 1907, then January to May in 1908 and similarly in 1909 when he was joined by actor manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Cromer failed to meet Caine during his visit to Egypt in 1907, instead Caine wrote urging him to grant the Egyptians wish \"for a speedy fulfilment of England's promise to get out of Egypt as soon as it was safe to do so\" and to \"yield to legitimate claims to national independence\". Originally entitled The White Christ, it was serialised in the British and US editions of The Strand Magazine between December 1908 and November 1909, and subsequently translated into seven languages. The Arabic translation was serialised in Cairo-based newspaper al-Minbar. Douglas Sladen read the first two instalments of The White Prophet and had the idea of writing a counterblast, the novel The Tragedy of the Pyramids: A Romance of Army Life in Egypt. Closing the preface he writes \"I felt bound to challenge the false light in which he presents the British Army of Occupation in Egypt to the public\". A copyright performance was performed at the Garrick Theatre, London on 27 November 1908. Beerbohm Tree's plans to produce a dramatised version at His Majesty's Theatre, London, which he was to direct and star in, were abandoned following threats to lobby the Lord Chamberlain against granting a licence for the play, banning it. Cromer is reported to have protested to the Lord Chamberlain's Department that \"the state of the Nationalist agitation in Egypt made a dramatic representation of some of its features injudicious\". The character of John Lord is widely believed to be Cromer. Promoting the publication of The White Prophet by Heinemann on 12 August 1909, Caine published a series of eight articles Aspects of the East in The Daily Telegraph. Heinemann published Shaw's The Critics of The White Prophet as a pamphlet, endorsing the novel's political viewpoint.  It was to have been the preface for the second edition."]}, {"page": "George Coulthard", "response": ["Author Douglas Sladen's short story \"At the Melbourne Cup\", published by Arthur Patchett Martin in Oak-Bough and Wattle-Blossom: Stories and Sketches by Australians in England (1888), follows a punter who bets on Dirk Hatteraick after learning of Coulthard's dream."]}, {"page": "Flora Annie Steel", "response": ["Steel's novel On the Face of the Waters (1896) describes incidents during the Indian Mutiny.

She afterwards did busts of Henry Fielding and other distinguished Somerset men for the same place. She began contributing verse to periodicals and in 1888 Douglas Sladen included seven of her poems in his Australian Poets.

George Bernard Shaw jokes about Gordon's verse in his play Shakes versus Shav, a dialogue between Shakespeare and himself during which Shakespeare laughs at a line attributed to Gordon. Critics dismissed some of Gordon's poetry as careless and banal, but conceded that, at his best, he is a poet of importance, who on occasions wrote some magnificent lines. Douglas Sladen, a lifelong admirer, in his Adam Lindsay Gordon, The Westminster Abbey Memorial Volume, made a selection of 27 poems that occupy about 90 pages."]}, {"page": "Yoshio Markino", "response": ["thumb|The first work Markino sold in England Japanese art, promised to introduce him to Charles Holmes (who was also known to be fond of the vogue for Japanese woodcuts) who was the editor of The Studio.Yone Noguchi: The Stream of Fate (Volume One: The Western Sea), Edward Marx, 2019, pp. 284 In November 1901, his works were published in Studio, introducing Markino as an artist.

His work in August was published in the Magazine of Art.
