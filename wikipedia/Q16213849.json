It was there that he began his partnership with his current trainer Gabriel Sarmiento, who worked out of a gym in Azuqueca de Henares. During his time in Spain, Mart\u00ednez also worked jobs such as; nightclub bouncer, dishwasher, construction worker and did modelling jobs for Adidas and Nike. From April 2002 \u2013 May 2003 he fought four times in Spain, all eight-round fights that he won against weak opposition, two of his opponents had lost their last six fights. This was to change in his next fight however, as he took on Richard Williams in England for the lightly regarded IBO light middleweight title. Mart\u00ednez, who entered the ring as an underdog, having had only eight days preparation, won a unanimous decision. Although Williams scored knockdowns in the second and eleventh rounds, he was close to being stopped in the final round and the scorecards were heavily in Mart\u00ednez's favour. He defended the IBO title twice in the United Kingdom; a twelfth round knock-out victory of Adrian Stone in Bristol was followed by a rematch against Williams in Belfast, on this occasion Williams was stopped in the ninth round. Over the next two and a half years, Mart\u00ednez won seven fights in a row back in Spain, six of which were against boxers who had losing records. Soon thereafter, Mart\u00ednez began to gain recognition and pursue fights in the United States, under the guidance of adviser Sampson Lewkowicz.", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Williams", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Williams"]}, {"page": "List of Commonwealth Boxing Council champions", "response": ["|align=left |  Richard Williams (2)", "|align=left |  Richard Williams (1)"]}, {"page": "Shannan Taylor", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Williams"]}, {"page": "Tony Badea", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Williams"]}]}}
