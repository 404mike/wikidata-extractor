He argues against what he terms \"somatism\", the philosophy and physics of bodies. In his Philosophies of Nature After Schelling, Grant tells a new history of philosophy from Plato onward based on the definition of matter. Aristotle distinguished between Form and Matter in such a way that Matter was invisible to philosophy, whereas Grant argues for a return to the Platonic Matter as not only the basic building blocks of reality, but the forces and powers that govern our reality. He traces this same argument to the post-Kantian German Idealists Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, claiming that the distinction between Matter as substantive versus useful fiction persists to this day and that we should end our attempts to overturn Plato and instead attempt to overturn Kant and return to \"speculative physics\" in the Platonic tradition, that is, not a physics of bodies, but a \"physics of the All\".", "* Iain Hamilton Grant"]}, {"page": "List of British philosophers", "response": ["* Iain Hamilton Grant"]}, {"page": "Object-oriented ontology", "response": ["Cultural critic Steven Shaviro has criticized object-oriented ontology as too dismissive of process philosophy.

Shaviro also finds fault with Harman's assertion that Whitehead, Simondon, and Iain Hamilton Grant undermine objects by positing objects as manifestations of a deeper, underlying substance, saying that the antecedence of these thinkers, particularly Grant and Simondon, includes the \"plurality of actually existing objects\", rather than a single substance of which objects are mere epiphenomena."]}, {"page": "Libidinal Economy", "response": ["Lyotard appropriates varying ideas of Freud's, in particular his idea of libidinal economy by which libido flows energetically through a structure of drives, while also using his idea of polymorphous perversity and appropriating Jacques Lacan's idea of jouissance to detail how masses of intensities form. He also introduces ideas of his own, such as a \"great ephemeral skin\" or \"libidinal band\" serving as a surface of reality harboring signs through which libidinal intensities pass, and the \"tensor\" which is a nihilist semiotic idea that stands for a sign with no \"unitary designation, meaning or calculable series of such designations or meanings\",Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Libidinal Economy, introduction by Iain Hamilton Grant, p. xii-xiv. as well as \"great\" zeros that correspond to Lacan's master signifier and \"concentratory\" zeros that correspond to Marx's notion of capital. These ideas are used to discuss relations of force, flow and intensity in philosophy and economics, while mainly asserting that theory, because of its \"immobility\", has never adequately described or caught up to these relations.
