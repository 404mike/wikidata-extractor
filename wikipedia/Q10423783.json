He was born in Countesthorpe, Leicestershire.\nHe played as a middle-order batsman for Leicestershire from 1938 to 1956, scoring over 1000 runs a season from 1946 to 1955. After his most productive season, 1955, when he scored 2190 runs, he was selected to tour Pakistan with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1955\u201356. However, he suffered ill-health when he returned, and died in hospital from pancreatic cancer after an operation. His highest score was 186 for Leicestershire against the touring Pakistan team in 1954.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Maurice Tompkin || 18,590"]}, {"page": "Alan Walker (Australian sportsman)", "response": ["He performed the unusual feat of taking four wickets in four balls for Nottinghamshire against Leicestershire at Leicester in 1956.

In Les Berry, they had the only professional captain in the County Championship. In July, they were involved in two exciting finishes, first when Middlesex were set to score 66 in 25 minutes and got them, courtesy of Edrich and Compton, to win by ten wickets with only four minutes to spare. Second, in their home match against Derbyshire, Leicestershire themselves succeeded in a run chase scoring 391 to win by three wickets at over eighty runs an hour, the winning run coming from a straight six off the third ball of the final over. Leicestershire were a strong batting side with Berry, Vic Jackson, Gerry Lester, Francis Prentice, Maurice Tompkin and George Watson all exceeding 1,000 runs while all-rounder Anthony Riddington scored over 800. Wicketkeeper Percy Corrall claimed 59 victims in championship matches. The main bowler was Jack Walsh, a great exponent of slow left-arm wrist-spin, who took 152 wickets in all matches. Jackson and the veteran James Sperry bowled well but Leicestershire's main need was a good pace bowler. Other players were Thomas Chapman, Jack Howard and Harry Pickering.Playfair, pp. 106\u2013107."]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| Maurice Tompkin"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Maurice Tompkin||||FW||10||1||0||0||10||1"]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Maurice Tompkin 149"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Maurice Tompkin||||1946\u20131947||10||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||10||1"]}, {"page": "Ronald Harvey (cricketer)", "response": ["Harvey made his only first-class appearance for Essex against T.
