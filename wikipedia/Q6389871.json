Jack Andrews, leader of the Senate, came under pressure from many including O'Neill, to stand, however he refused.  In His memoirs, Kenneth Bloomfield suggests that Chichester-Clark's resignation from the cabinet which precipitated O'Neill's own resignation, had been a ploy to deprive Faulkner.  In his own memoirs, Faulkner claims that it was a matter of class distinction, where the upper classes had conspired to keep the Premiership out of middle class hands.  Following his headline grabbing resignation, and O'Neill's endorsement in the absence of Andrews candidature, Chichester-Clark was expected to win by a clear margin and the close result came as a great surprise.  O'Neill voted for his distant cousin, and also used his casting vote in his favour. It has been said that he favoured Chichester-Clark not due to their distant family links, but as Faulkner had been stabbing him in the back for longer.Walker, G, A History of the Ulster Unionist Party, 2004)"]}, {"page": "Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains", "response": ["The current commissioners are Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, former head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and former Northern Ireland Victims Commissioner, and Mr Frank Murray, former Secretary to the Government (Cabinet Secretary) and former Chairman of the Irish Public Appointments Service,ICLVR website who took over from John Wilson.Appointment of Commissioner of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains Irish Govt.
