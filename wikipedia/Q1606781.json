The Marina was the first car design that used this idea. Although this idea carried great potential benefits for a company selling cars under numerous different brands across multiple market sectors it was looked on as too radical by the management of British Leyland and Triumph designer Harry Webster was drafted in to push the project forward. Roy Haynes soon left the company."]}, {"page": "Triumph Stag", "response": ["The car started as a styling experiment cut and shaped from a 1963\u201364 pre-production 2000 saloon, also styled by Giovanni Michelotti. His agreement was, if Harry Webster, Director of Engineering at Triumph, liked the design, Triumph could use the prototype as the basis of a new model. Webster loved the design and took the prototype back to England. The end result, a two-door drop head (convertible), had little in common with the styling of its progenitor 2000, but retained the suspension and drive line. Triumph liked the Michelotti design so much that they propagated the styling lines of the Stag into the new T2000/T2500 saloon and estate model lines of the 1970s."]}, {"page": "Triumph slant-four engine", "response": ["In 1963 Triumph's Chief Engine Designer Lewis Dawtrey presented the results of his analysis of future engine technology trends and Triumph's anticipated needs. After evaluating rotary, horizontally opposed, V4 and V6 configurations Dawtrey recommended an OHC engine family composed of both Inline-4 and V8 engines that could be built with the same tooling. The new range would be built in capacities of 1.5\u00a0L to 3.0\u00a0L, allowing it to replace both the four-cylinder Standard SC and derivative Triumph I6 engines whose roots reached back to the Standard Eight of 1953. The recommendation was accepted and development began in-house at Triumph by a design team led by Dawtrey and Harry Webster. The initial model was to be a 1.5\u00a0L inline four."]}, {"page": "Triumph Herald", "response": ["Giovanni Michelotti was commissioned to style the car by the Standard-Triumph board, encouraged by chief engineer Harry Webster, and quickly produced designs for a two-door saloon with a large glass area that gave 93 per cent all-round visibility in the saloon variant and the \"razor-edge\" looks to which many makers were turning. As Fisher & Ludlow, Standard-Triumph's body suppliers became part of an uncooperative British Motor Corporation, it was decided that the car should have a separate chassis rather than adopting the newer unitary construction. The main body tub was bolted to the chassis and the whole front end hinged forward to allow access to the engine. Every panel\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including the sills and roof\u00a0\u2013\u00a0could be unbolted from the car so that different body styles could be easily built on the same chassis. As an addition to the original coup\u00e9 and saloon models, a convertible was introduced in 1960.Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, page 202"]}, {"page": "BMC ADO17", "response": ["In 1967 Pininfarina unveiled at the Turin Motor Show a concept car based on the Landcrab called the BMC 1800 Aerodinamica.
