Assistant manager Dean White felt that McLeod could have a big season at the club. He scored twice in his first season at Brighton, with strikes against Northampton in the Football League Trophy and Hartlepool in the FA Cup. However, after many injuries and time spent playing in the reserves due to lack of fatigue and excessive weight, McLeod was released from his contract at Brighton at the end of January 2010. He quickly signed a short-term contract until the end of June 2010 with League One side Wycombe Wanderers. Making his debut in a 1\u20131 draw at Brentford, he played eleven games for the club before being released at the end of the season.
