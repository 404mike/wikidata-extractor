Two minutes later, Northampton Town's Hoskins was brought down by Atangana in the penalty area but the referee declined to award a penalty and in the 55th minute, Watson was booked for a foul on Randell Williams.  On 59 minutes, Exeter City were reduced to ten players when Dean Moxey was sent off after being shown a red card for a late tackle on Watson.

With 19 minutes of regular time remaining, Morton went through one-on-one with Maxted but his shot went just past the outside of the post.  Collins was then brought down in the box as he went to shoot, but no penalty was awarded and replays indicated that Northampton Town's Marshall won the ball legally.  In the 75th minute, Alan McCormack and Oliver were replaced by James Olayinka and Harry Smith for Northampton Town.  Five minutes later Hoskins made it 3\u20130 converting Marshall's pass at the far post.

With four minutes of the match remaining, Martin was shown a yellow card for a foul on Morton, and two minutes later, Northampton Town made their final changes, with Morton and Watson being substituted for Andy Williams and Paul Anderson.
