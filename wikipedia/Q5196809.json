He made his debut for the club on 10 January 1903 in the 1\u20130 win against Lincoln City at Turf Moor; the winning goal was scored by Cuthbert Storey, who was also playing in his first senior match after transferring from Burnley Belvedere. Bell was selected once more in the 1902\u201303 campaign, playing at left inside forward in the 1\u20133 defeat to Leicester Fosse on 24 January 1903.Simpson (2007), p. 89 He was unable to break into the team for the first five months of the following season due to the form of fellow inside forward William Jackson, a new signing from Barrow. He made his first appearance of the campaign in the goalless draw away at Grimsby Town on 30 January 1904. Bell scored his first competitive goal for Burnley in the 2\u20130 win over Gainsborough Trinity three weeks later, and on 12 March he scored a late goal in the 1\u20133 loss away to Manchester United. In total, Bell played eleven league matches during the 1903\u201304 season and scored four goals.Simpson (2007), p. 93"]}]}}
