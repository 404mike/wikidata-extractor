He fell out with his older brother, King James III, and fled to France, where he unsuccessfully sought help. In 1482 he invaded Scotland with the army of King Edward IV of England and assumed control of the country. Scottish lords turned against him in 1483 and he fled after Edward died. The second invasion, in 1484, was not supported by the new English king, Richard III, and failed. He died in a duel with the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, by a splinter from his lance.", "link_mentions": {}}}
