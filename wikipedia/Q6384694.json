In October 2004, the architect was awarded the 2004 Stirling Prize. For the first time in the prize's history, the judges were unanimous. In December 2005, a survey of the world's largest firms of architects published in 2006 BD World Architecture 200 voted the tower as the most admired new building in the world. However, Ken Shuttleworth, who worked for Foster + Partners on the design of the building, said in 2011 that he believed the style was now out-moded: \"I was looking at the glass all around and [thought], 'Why on earth did we do that?' Now we would do things differently\". The building appeared in recent films such as Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, A Good Year, Basic Instinct 2, and Match Point and, rechristened the Spirit of London, became the spaceship centrepiece of Keith Mansfield's 2008 novel Johnny Mackintosh and the Spirit of London."]}, {"page": "1965 in literature", "response": ["**Keith Mansfield, English novelist and publisher"]}, {"page": "Spitalfields", "response": ["*Keith Mansfield, writer and publisher, lives locally."]}, {"page": "Nottingham High School", "response": ["*Keith Mansfield (b. 1965), writer"]}, {"page": "West Bridgford School", "response": ["*Keith Mansfield, writer and author of the Johnny Mackintosh novels"]}, {"page": "List of young adult writers", "response": ["*Keith Mansfield: Johnny Mackintosh series"]}, {"page": "Space elevators in fiction", "response": ["* Johnny Mackintosh and the Spirit of London, novel by Keith Mansfield.
