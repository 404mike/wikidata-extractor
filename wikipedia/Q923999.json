Although it was not a commercial success, it did bring them to the attention of the UK underground scene, which found them playing free concerts, benefit gigs, and festivals. Playing free outside the Bath Festival, they encountered another Ladbroke Grove based band, the Pink Fairies, who shared similar interests in music and recreational activities; a friendship developed which led to the two bands becoming running partners and performing as \"Pinkwind\". Their use of drugs, however, led to the departure of Harrison, who did not partake, to be replaced briefly by Thomas Crimble (about July 1970\u2013March 1971). Crimble played on a few BBC sessions before leaving to help organise the Glastonbury Free Festival 1971; he sat in during the band's performance there.

The group's first appearance, under the name the Rollin' Stones (after one of their favourite Muddy Waters tunes), was at the Marquee Club, a London jazz club, on 12\u00a0July 1962. They would later change their name to \"the Rolling Stones\" as it seemed more formal.

However, Richards says in his memoir Life that \"The drummer that night was Mick Avory\u2013not Tony Chapman, as history has mysteriously handed it down...\" In June 1963, the band began a five month residency at Eel Pie Island Hotel, which the BBC later credited with shaping the band's career. By that autumn, Jagger had left the London School of Economics to pursue his promising musical career with the Rolling Stones. The group played songs by American rhythm and blues artists like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but strongly encouraged by manager Andrew Loog Oldham, Jagger and Richards soon began to write songs. Their songwriting partnership took some time to develop; one of their early compositions was \"As Tears Go By\", a song written for Marianne Faithfull, a young singer Loog Oldham was promoting.  For the Rolling Stones, the duo would write \"The Last Time\", the group's third number one single in the UK (their first two UK number one hits being remakes of songs that had been recorded by other artists \"It's All Over Now\" by Bobby Womack and \"Little Red Rooster\" by Willie Dixon) based on \"This May Be the Last Time\", a traditional Negro spiritual song recorded by the Staple Singers in 1955. Jagger and Richards also wrote their first international hit, \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\".

Prior to his dismissal from the group in 1969, Jones typically played all of the instruments in the Stones' music which deviated from standard rock set up of drums, guitars, piano, and bass. His ability to play a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums Aftermath (1966), Between the Buttons (1967) and Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967). As a guitarist, in the early days he favoured a white teardrop-shaped electric guitar produced by the Vox company, especially in live performances; he also played a wide variety of electric and acoustic guitars from companies such as Rickenbacker, Gibson, and Fender. As a slide guitarist, he favoured the open E and open G tunings.Paul Trynka interview with Dick Taylor, early bass player for the Rolling Stones: "]}, {"page": "Keith Richards", "response": ["Richards attended Wentworth Primary School with Mick Jagger and was his neighbour until 1954 when the Richards and Jagger families both moved.

In 1959, Richards was expelled from Dartford Tech for truancy and transferred to Sidcup Art College, where he met Dick Taylor. At Sidcup, he was diverted from his studies proper and devoted more time to playing guitar with other students in the boys' room.

Because there were too many guitar players in the band, Taylor switched to bass. He quit the Stones five months later, when he was accepted at the Central School of Art and Design in London. Phil May, another Sidcup student, convinced him to form a new band. Taylor was once again playing guitar, with May singing and playing harmonica.
