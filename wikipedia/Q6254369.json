His six older brothers were all taught to play the fiddle by his father.  However, as he was too small, his father had a dulcimer made by John's brother Alexander (a carpenter), using a borrowed dulcimer as a pattern, and that became John's instrument. This instrument was in turn used as the pattern for many other instruments made for other local people. In contrast to the wooden hammers generally employed by today's players, John used hammers made of thick steel wire, wound with wool; he made these himself from old bicycle spokes.  His repertoire consisted mostly of traditional Irish tunes, though with a significant Scottish influence (he also played a number of strathspeys, which he referred to as \"highlands\").  His father taught him a number of jigs by the 18th-century composer Walker \"Piper\" Jackson (from the townland of Lisdaun, parish of Ballingarry, Aughrim, County Limerick).  Rea appeared on stage with the well-known group, The Chieftains.  John Rea died on 15 November 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hammered dulcimer", "response": ["Several traditional players have used hammers that differ substantially from those in common use today. Paul Van Arsdale (1920\u20132018), a player from upstate New York, used flexible hammers made from hacksaw blades, with leather-covered wooden blocks attached to the ends (these were modeled after the hammers used by his grandfather, Jesse Martin). The Irish player John Rea (1915\u20131983) used hammers made of thick steel wire, which he made himself from old bicycle spokes wrapped with wool.
