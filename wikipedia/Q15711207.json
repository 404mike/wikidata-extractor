Great Britain is not a leading nation at the Winter Olympics, but has had a few successes in sports such as figure skating, curling and bob skeleton. A number of athletes represented Great Britain in the freestyle skiing discipline when it debuted at the 2014 Winter Olympics. Snowboarder Jenny Jones made history at those Games as the first British competitor to win a medal in an event on snow when she took a bronze in the slopestyle competition.  Another British snowboarder, Billy Morgan, won a bronze medal in the big air competition in the 2018 Winter Olympics."]}, {"page": "List of snowboard tricks", "response": ["Spins are typically performed in 180\u00b0 increments due to the nature of the obstacles on which they are performed.  Even in cases where spins are performed on unconventional obstacles, the rotation is regarded as the nearest increment of 180\u00b0, and can be identified by the direction of approach and landing (regular and switch). A spin attempted from a jump to a rail is the only time a spin can be referred to in a 90-degree increment, examples: 270 (between a 180 and 360-degree spin) or 450 (between a 360 and 540-degree spin). These spins can be frontside, backside, cab, or switch-backside just like any other spins. In April 2015 British snowboarder and Winter Olympic medallist Billy Morgan demonstrated the world's first quadruple cork 1800, the biggest spin ever.", ";Cork: Spins are corked or corkscrew when the axis of the spin allows for the snowboarder to be oriented sideways or upside-down in the air, typically without becoming completely inverted (though the head and shoulders should drop below the relative position of the board). \u00a0Peter Line is credited with originating the corked spin and first landing it on film in Transworld Snowboarding Video Magazine Vol 1.  A Double-Cork refers to a rotation in which a snowboarder inverts or orients themselves sideways at two distinct times during an aerial rotation. David Benedek is the originator of the Double-Cork in the Half-pipe, but the Double-Cork is also a very common trick in Big-Air competitions. Shaun White is known for making this trick famous in the half-pipe.  Several snowboarders have recently extended the limits of technical snowboarding by performing triple-cork variations, Torstein Horgmo being the first to land one in competition. Mark McMorris originated Backside Triple-Cork 1440's in 2011. In April 2015 British snowboarder and Winter Olympic medallist Billy Morgan demonstrated the world's first quadruple cork 1800.
