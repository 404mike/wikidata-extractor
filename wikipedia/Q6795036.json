On 15 June 1890, she married Hubert LeGay Solly (23 April 1856 \u2013 1 December 1912) an English engineer who was working abroad due to health issues for the South African government on the railroads. That same year, the couple moved to De Aar, where Solly joined the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. By 1895 she was serving as superintendent of its suffrage unit. An ardent pacifist, she sent letters to her father during the Second Boer War, recounting atrocities of the conflict Soon after the war ended, her husband retired in 1904 because of his health problems and settled on his farm near Knor Hoek, Sir Lowry's Pass, Cape Colony. In 1907, Solly helped found Cape Branch of the Women's Enfranchisement League (WEL), the first organisation in South Africa created to gain women the right to vote. She became a correspondent of Olive Schreiner and their letters mainly have to do with suffrage business. Schreiner was concerned about factionalism and exhorted Solly to put aside religious or racial differences and eliminate divisive elements, like one-time president, Irene Macfadyen (1907\u20131908), who was simultaneously a member of an anti-women's suffrage group. Solly became one of the most recognisable figures in the Cape Colony's suffrage movement."]}]}}
