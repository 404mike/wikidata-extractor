A member of the prominent Howard family, he was the great-grandson of Lord William Howard, third son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Lord William Howard's wife was Elizabeth Dacre, youngest daughter of Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre (of Gillesland), a title which had fallen into abeyance on the death of the fifth Baron in 1569. Through this marriage, Naworth Castle and Henderskelfe Castle (which later became the site of Castle Howard) came into the Howard family. Lord Carlisle had earlier supported the Parliamentarian cause in the Civil War, and he is supposed to have been created Baron Gilsland and Viscount Howard of Morpeth by Oliver Cromwell in 1657 (it is certain that he was summoned to Cromwell's House of Lords the same year as \"Lord Viscount Howard\").", "Several other members of this branch of the Howard family have gained distinction. The Hon. Sir Charles Howard, fourth son of the third Earl, was a general in the Army and also represented Carlisle in the House of Commons for many years. Charles Howard, Viscount Morpeth, eldest son of the fourth Earl from his first marriage, briefly represented Yorkshire before his early death from tuberculosis. The Hon. Frederick Howard, third son of the fifth Earl, was a major in the 10th Hussars and fought at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, where he was killed in action.
