That was a big thing for me with this album. I was hearing what was going on out there and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t really want to make a record that sounds like that.\u2019\" Critics have noted this as a potential influence on the album's eclectic style. Dobie got the idea for the album's title when he heard George Clinton utter it in a Funkadelic documentary. Dobie has also used the phrase to describe the music on the album itself--\"It's a bit out there, a bit nutty, but don't be scared of it,\" he said in a 2013 interview.", "The 13 songs on the album are all instrumentals, which differs significantly from the hip hop music Dobie originally became famous for. Instead, the songs on We Will Not Harm You take cues from many disparate genres of music, such as, according to Exclaim!, \"Afrobeat, techno, Latin rhythms, jazz and electronica.\" Artists to whom the album's music has been compared include Flying Lotus and DJ Shadow."]}, {"page": "Battle (song)", "response": ["# \"Battle\" (Dobie mix part 1)", ":B2. \"Battle\" (Dobie mix part 1)", "# \"Battle\" (Dobie mix part 1)", "# \"Battle\" (Dobie mix part 1)"]}, {"page": "The Sound of One Hand Clapping", "response": ["* The Sound of One Hand Clapping, a 1998 album by British musician Dobie, also released as a remix in 2004"]}]}}
