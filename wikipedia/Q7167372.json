For that novel, Greg created what may have been the first artistic language that was described with linguistic and grammatical terminology. It also contained what is possibly the first instance in the English language of the word \"Astronaut\".\nIn 2010 a crater on Mars was named Greg in recognition of his contribution to the lore of Mars.", "link_mentions": {}}}
