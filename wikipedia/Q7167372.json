For that novel, Greg created what may have been the first artistic language that was described with linguistic and grammatical terminology. It also contained what is possibly the first instance in the English language of the word \"Astronaut\".\nIn 2010 a crater on Mars was named Greg in recognition of his contribution to the lore of Mars.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Astronaut", "response": ["A professional space traveler is called an astronaut.

Rosny a\u00een\u00e9, the word astronautique (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by \"aeronaut\", an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloonists.

Burroughs' novels bear a number of striking similarities to Arnold's.

Gullivar is a more hapless character, however, paling beside the heroic and accomplished Carter; he stumbles in and out of trouble and never quite succeeds in mastering it.  The fact that Gullivar does not quite defeat his enemies or get the girl in the end helps explain why Arnold's Martian saga was not as popular as Burroughs', which eventually extended to eleven volumes."]}, {"page": "Gregg (surname)", "response": ["*Percy Greg (1836\u20131889), English writer, son of William Rathbone Greg"]}, {"page": "Annals of the Twenty-Ninth Century", "response": ["Blair's work is one of a group of early science fiction novels that are now little known, but were influential in their own time\u2014group that includes Edward Maitland's By and By (1873), Percy Greg's Across the Zodiac (1880), and John Jacob Astor IV's A Journey in Other Worlds (1894).Ignatius Frederick Clarke, The Tale of the Future, From the Beginning to the Present Day: An Annotated Bibliography of Those Satires, Ideal States, Imaginary Wars and Invasions, Coming Catastrophes and End-of-the-World Stories, Political Warnings and Forecasts, Inter-Planetary Voyages and Scientific Romances\u2014All Located in an Imaginary Future Period\u2014that have been Published in the United Kingdom Between 1644 and 1976, London, Library Association, 1978.Everett Franklin Bleiler, The Checklist of Fantastic Literature: A Bibliography of Fantasy, Weird and Science Fiction Books Published in the English Language, Chicago, Shasta Publishers, 1948.

Such characters are usually super-humanly efficient language learners. One such example is John Carter, a character in Edgar Rice Burrough\u2019s Barsoom series. Similar to this strategy, other authors make the unfamiliar language simple to learn; one such example can be seen in Across the Zodiac by Percy Greg. Despite Greg\u2019s description of the language as simple, the structure of the language is still that of an Indo-European language. This makes the language only simple to the author whose very own language is Indo-European. When languages are simple, John Krueger argues that authors cannot resist the temptation of making it difficult in some aspect of language. Although, difficulty in phonology can be justified considering alien anatomy."]}, {"page": "William John Birch", "response": ["Birch became interested in Auguste Comte and positivism.

Highly influential in popularizing the \"science\" part of the science fiction was the 19th-century French writer Jules Verne, whose method of space travel in his 1865 novel, From the Earth to the Moon (and its sequel, Around the Moon), was explained mathematically, and whose vehicle \u2014 the gun-launched space capsule \u2014 was described as the first such vehicle to be \"scientifically conceived\" in fiction. Percy Greg's Across the Zodiac (1880) featured a space ship with a small garden, an early prediction of hydroponics. Another writer who attempted to merge concrete scientific ideas with science fiction prose was the turn of the century Russian writer and scientist, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, known for popularizing the concept of rocketry. George Mann pointed to works such as Robert A. Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo (1947) and Arthur C. Clarke's Prelude to Space (1951) as some of the early, influential modern works that focused on the scientific and engineering aspects of space travel. From the 1960s onward, the growing popularity of modern technology with the public also led to increasing depictions of interplanetary spaceships as based on the advanced but plausible extension of real, modern technology."]}]}}
