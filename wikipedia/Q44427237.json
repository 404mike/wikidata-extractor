His collections of artefacts and photographs are held in the Pitt Rivers Museum. \nMan was the son of Captain Henry Man of the Madras Staff Corps and Emma Martha. Captain Henry Man had helped establish the penal settlement at Port Blair and was later briefly Resident Councillor at Singapore before returning to Port Blair. Captain Henry Man took an interest in the Andamanese people and conducted some explorations of kitchen middens at some sites on the islands. Little is known of Man's early life but he joined his father in October 1869 and became an assistant superintendent at the Penal Settlement. He also served as a treasurer from 1869 to 1870 and as officer in charge of the Andaman Homes from 1875 to 1879. Between 1880 and 1882 he visited England on leave and visited various societies and passed on some of his collections to General Augustus Pitt Rivers. He also worked in the Nicobar Islands briefly. During this period he made linguistic and ethnological studies on the native people, documenting their lives with photographs. Franz Boas credits Man with having offered a slightly more nuanced ethnography of the Andamanese compared to the writings of previous travellers, including Marco Polo.Man was influenced by correspondence with theorists like Augustus Pitt Rivers and his book Notes and Queries. Maurice Vidal Portman considered Man as the Anthropological Institute's \"pet\" and Henry Moseley described him as the kind of collector who might send \"four or five entire Nicobar villages with all the inhabitants inside.\" Man retired in 1900 to England and lived at Surbiton and later Preston Park in Brighton. A monograph of his writings on the Nicobar Islands was posthumously published by his sister Amy Frances. This book The Nicobar Islands and Their People included a brief biography written by Sir David Prain. He was made CIE in 1893. His collections are distributed across museums in Cambridge, Oxford, London, Leiden, Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Florence, Halifax, Edinburgh, and Calcutta.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1893 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Edward Horace Man, Deputy Superintendent of the Andamans."]}, {"page": "Dudhnath Tewari", "response": ["Tiwari was a sepoy of the 14th regiment of native infantry and had been sentenced for mutiny and desertion during the 1857 rebellion. He was sent to the penal settlement at Port Blair on the 8th of April 1858 but he, along with 90 others, escaped from the Ross Island Penal Colony on the 23rd. The escapees made rafts with felled trees, tied with tent ropes. A fellow prisoner Aga had claimed that the shore opposite was 10 days of walking from the capital of Burma. All earlier prisoners who had attempted an escape had either returned to the penal settlement after being lost in the jungle for days without food or had been killed by the tribals. Tiwari was the sole survivor of this escape attempt and he submitted a report of his travels to Dr J.P. Walker, the superintendent. In his statements which were reprinted widely he recounted his escape and life among the tribals. He claimed that the escape party had met up with another bunch of escapees from Phoenix Bay and Chatham Island and together, nearly 130 convicts, walked through the jungle for eight days without food. They then found some fruits to eat and obtained water from some freshwater springs and by cutting certain creeping canes. Twelve members were left to die of hunger and thirst. They never came across any natives, but came across abandoned dwellings. On the fourteenth day they were surrounded at noon by a party of 100 aborigines armed with bows and arrows. Attempts to signal surrender failed and a large number of convicts were killed. Tiwari escaped with arrow wounds on the eyebrow, elbow, and shoulder along with Shoo Dull and another convict (identified only as belonging to the Kurmi caste) and reached a tidal creek and spent the night there. The next day they were detected by another party of tribals who shot at them, killing the two and leaving Tiwari wounded and feigning dead. He was dragged out and shot at again, he feigned dead and then attempted to remove the arrows. The tribals then took him in their boat and applied soil to his wounds. They then took him to another island called Turmooglee. His wounds healed and he adopted the tribal customs, living naked with a shaved head. The tribals looked upon him with suspicion and never let him use a bow and arrow. They never made him work and after about four months, Pooteah, an elder assigned his daughter Leepa, of twenty, and another girl of sixteen called Jigah, daughter of Heera, as wives. Tiwari described his views on the lives of the tribes. He claimed that the aboriginals had no idea of a God and he had five wives in all with very little ceremony. Babies were reared and suckled by any nursing mothers in the tribe. After spending a year and 24 days, he returned to the convict settlement to warn them of the impending attack.Adopted in Andamans\" Chambers's Journal of Popular Literature, Science and art. 24 March 1860. Reprinted in History of Anthropology Newsletter 36(4). 2009. F.J. Mouat considered Tewari's account as exaggerated and compared him with Munchausen. Edward Horace Man also considered some of Tiwari's accounts to have been concocted."]}, {"page": "Frederik Adolph de Roepstorff", "response": ["De Roepstorff was a member of several scholarly societies including the Asiatic Society of Bengal to whose journal he contributed notes. In his spare time he took a great interest in the fauna and flora, collecting specimens for the Indian Museum, as well as sending them to specialists in Europe. He also explored the region and wrote to various journals of ethnology and geographical exploration. With geologist Ferdinand Stoliczka, he explored a kitchen midden in the Andamans that they dated to the Neolithic period.  He also helped set up the Nicobar Islands Eclipse station to observe the total solar eclipse of 6 April 1875. The scientific team included Captain J. Waterhouse, Professor A. Pedler and Pietro Tacchini. As an ethnologist, he also recorded stories and beliefs. In one publication, he notes that the Nicobarese had a rule that the name of a dead person should never be mentioned. This essentially meant that they could not have an oral history. De Roepstorff and his wife were both interested in linguistics, philology, and ethnography and they compiled a dictionary of the Nancowry dialect. They also edited a translation of the Gospel of  Matthew into Nicobarese which had been begun by Moravian missionaries and this was published after his death by his wife in 1884. His work on linguistics was continued by his successor Edward Horace Man. He also collected specimens of birds from the Islands and corresponded with A.O. Hume who named it Strix De-Roepstorffi (now Tyto deroepstorffi) after him in 1875. He contributed insects, molluscs, and snake specimens to the Indian Museum. Several insects described from his collections bear his name - including Eurema blanda roepstorffi, Euploea midamus roepstorffi, Prosopeas roepstorffi, Hebomoia glaucippe roepstorffi and Diceros roepstorffi . He sent molluscs to the Indian Museum among which he named one species as Ennea (Huttonella) moerchiana after his Danish collaborator Otto Andreas Lowson M\u00f6rch in a manuscript, a name that was retained in the formal description by Geoffrey Nevill. His collections of molluscs were made available to H.H. Godwin-Austen by Christiane after her husband's death."]}]}}
