Real surfers were critical of the band for not being true adherents of the sport. As authenticity became a higher concern among critics, the group's legitimacy in rock music became an oft-repeated criticism, especially since their early songs appeared to celebrate a politically unconscious youth culture. Music critic Kenneth Partridge blamed the lack of \"edginess\" on the group's early records for why they are \"rarely talked about in the same breath as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and when they are, it's really only because of two albums\". The \"particular appeal\" of Wilson's genius, according to music critic Barney Hoskyns, was \"the fact that the Beach Boys were the very obverse of hip \u2013 the unlikeliness of these songs growing out of disposable surf pop \u2013 and in the singular naivety and ingenuousness of his personality.\" Luis Sanchez argued that despite the immaturity of their early songs, \"what matters is that it captured a lack of self-consciousness\u2014a genuineness\u2014that set them apart from their peers. And it was this quality that came to define Brian's oeuvre as he moved beyond and into bigger pop productions that would culminate in Smile.\""]}, {"page": "James Brown", "response": ["Aide Bob Patton has asserted that he accidentally shared a PCP-laced cannabis joint with Brown in the mid-1970s and \"hallucinated for hours\", although Brown \"talked about it as if it was only marijuana he was smoking\". By the mid-1980s, it was widely alleged that Brown was using drugs, with Vicki Anderson confirming to journalist Barney Hoskyns that Brown's regular use of PCP (colloquially known as \"angel dust\") \"began before 1982\". After he met and later married Adrienne Rodriguez in 1984, she and Brown began using PCP together. This drug usage often resulted in violent outbursts from him, and he was arrested several times for domestic violence against Rodriguez while high on the drug. By January 1988, Brown faced four criminal charges within a 12-month span relating to driving, PCP, and gun possession. After an April 1988 arrest for domestic abuse, Brown went on the CNN program Sonya Live in L.A. with host Sonya Friedman. The interview became notorious for Brown's irreverent demeanor, with some asserting that Brown was high."]}, {"page": "Tom Waits", "response": ["He continued performing at the Troubadour and there met David Geffen, who gave Waits a recording contract with his Asylum Records. Jerry Yester was chosen to produce his first album, with the recording sessions taking place in Hollywood's Sunset Sound studios. The resulting album, Closing Time, was released in March 1973, although it attracted little attention and did not sell well. Biographer Barney Hoskyns noted that Closing Time was \"broadly in step with the singer-songwriter school of the early 1970s\"; Waits had wanted to create a piano-led jazz album although Yester had pushed its sound in a more folk-oriented direction. An Eagles cover of its opening track, \"Ol' 55\", on their album On the Border, brought Waits further money and recognition, although he regarded their version as \"a little antiseptic\".", "During interviews, he deflected questions about his personal life, and refused to sanction any biography. When Barney Hoskyns was researching his unauthorized 2009 biography, Lowside of the Road: A Life of Tom Waits, Waits and his wife asked people not to talk to him. Hoskyns believed that it was Brennan who was responsible for the \"wall of inaccessibility\" surrounding Waits."]}, {"page": "Todd Rundgren", "response": ["A Wizard, a True Star was released in March 1973. At Rundgren's behest, no singles were issued from the album, as he wanted the tracks to be heard in the context of the LP. Its release coincided with the success of the \"Hello It's Me\" single, which gave Rundgren a reputation as a ballad singer, in marked contrast to the content on Wizard. Although critical reception to the album was mixed, Wizard became highly influential to musicians in the ensuing decades. In 2003, music journalist Barney Hoskyns called the record \"the greatest album of all time ... a dizzying, intoxicating rollercoaster ride of emotions and genre mutations [that] still sounds more bravely futuristic than any ostensibly cutting-edge electro-pop being made in the 21st Century.\" In 2018, Pitchforks Sam Sodsky wrote that the \"fingerprints\" of Wizard remained \"evident on bedroom auteurs to this day\"."]}, {"page": "Hardcore punk", "response": ["Music writer Barney Hoskyns attributed hardcore being younger, faster and angrier than punk rock, to adolescents who were sick of their life in a \"bland Republican\" America. Hardcore punk lyrics often express anti-establishment, anti-militarist, anti-authoritarian, anti-violence, and pro-environmentalist sentiments, in addition to other typically left-wing, anarchist, or egalitarian political views. During the 1980s, the subculture often rejected what was perceived to be \"yuppie\" materialism and interventionist American foreign policy. Numerous hardcore punk bands have taken far left political stances such as anarchism or other varieties of socialism and in the 1980s expressed opposition to political leaders such as then US president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Reagan's economic policies, sometimes dubbed Reaganomics, and social conservatism were common subjects for criticism by hardcore bands of the time. Jimmy Gestapo of Murphy's Law, however, endorsed Reagan and even went as far to call then former-president Jimmy Carter a \"pussy\" in a 1986 New York Magazine cover story. Shortly after Reagan's death in 2004, the Maximumrocknroll radio show aired an episode composed of anti-Reagan songs by early hardcore punk bands."]}, {"page": "Rubber Soul", "response": ["Paul Williams launched Crawdaddy! in February 1966 with the aim of reflecting the sophistication brought to the genre by Rubber Soul and Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home \u2013 the two albums that, in music journalist Barney Hoskyns' description, \"arguably gave birth to 'rock' as a more solid concept than 'pop.

Christopher Bray describes it as \"the album that proved that rock and roll could be suitable for adult audiences\", \"the first long-playing pop record to really merit the term 'album and the LP that \"turned pop music into high art\"."]}, {"page": "Brian Wilson", "response": ["Music journalist Barney Hoskyns wrote that \"It was almost certainly [Bob] Norberg who turned Brian on to the productions of Phil Spector\". According to White, the Crystals' Spector-produced hit \"He's a Rebel\" (1962) \"hit Brian hardest\" when it was released. Biographer James Murphy says that Lou Adler may have personally introduced Wilson to Spector around June 1963. Wilson's 2016 memoir states that he met Spector only a few days after hearing the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\" (1963) for the first time."]}, {"page": "Stereolab", "response": ["Released in September 1997, Dots and Loops was their first album to enter the Billboard 200 charts, peaking at number 111. The album leaned towards jazz with bossa nova and 60's pop influences. Barney Hoskyns wrote in Rolling Stone that with it the group moved \"ever further away from the one-chord Velvets drone-mesh of its early days\" toward easy-listening and Europop. A review in German newspaper Die Zeit stated that in Dots and Loops, Stereolab transformed the harder Velvet Underground-like riffs of previous releases into \"softer sounds and noisy playfulness\". Contributors to the album included John McEntire and Jan St. Werner of German electropop duo Mouse on Mars. Stereolab toured for seven months and took a break when Gane and Sadier had a child. The group's third compilation of rarities, Aluminum Tunes, was issued in October 1998.", "The group have also received negative press. Barney Hoskyns questioned the longevity of their music in a 1996 Mojo review, saying that their records \"sound more like arid experiments than music born of emotional need.\" In Guardian, Dave Simpson stated: \"With their borrowings from early, obscure Kraftwerk and hip obtuse sources, [Stereolab] sound like a band of rock critics rather than musicians.\" L\u00e6titia Sadier's vocals were cited by author Stuart Shea as often being \"indecipherable\"."]}, {"page": "Pet Sounds", "response": ["The album also furthered the \"rock as art\" concept heralded by Rubber Soul. In the belief of music journalist Barney Hoskyns, \"If the Beatles' Rubber Soul was the first album to make a case for pop music as a maturing art form, 1966's Pet Sounds was a quantum leap into the unknown\". According to Gary Graff, Pet Sounds \"can be seen as a launch pad for the album era\", alongside Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited (1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966)."]}, {"page": "NME", "response": ["Writers at this time included Mat Snow, Chris Bohn (known in his later years at the paper as 'Biba Kopf'), Barney Hoskyns, Paolo Hewitt, Don Watson, Danny Kelly, Steven Wells, and David Quantick."]}, {"page": "Strange Days (The Doors album)", "response": ["Strange Days features a mingling of acid rock, psychedelic pop,  and psychedelic rock; termed by Barney Hoskyns as \"post-psychedelic pop\",  the band also explored musique concr\u00e8te techniques on the album.", "The liner notes for the 1967 U.S. Elektra album and the 2007 Rhino Records CD 40th Anniversary Edition liner notes with accompanying essays by Bruce Botnick and Barney Hoskyns may differ from other sources."]}, {"page": "Brian Wilson Presents Smile", "response": ["Conversely, The Times Stephen Dalton was skeptical of the album's myth and felt that most of the performance \"sounded like whimsical juvenilia. It was clearly adventurous for its era but, with the best will in the world, it is not difficult to see why Wilson's ... fellow Beach Boys balked at releasing it.\" Mojos Jim Irvin was similarly underwhelmed; although he enjoyed the songs, he wrote, \"To claim that this show was transcendent is to disregard the figure at its heart, a bewildered-looking man of 61 who barely plays the piano he's perched behind. ... its hard to feel uplifted, as such.\" Critic Barney Hoskyns wrote that it was \"a pretty magnificent evening\", although Wilson's apathetic demeanor resembled that of an autistic person's. Hoskyns mused, \"As bizarrely not-there as Brian seemed through all of this, he seemed to be enjoying himself as much as he is able to. Occasionally he flapped his arms about, and he made a big point of introducing 'Marcella' as a real 'rock'n'roll' song \u2013 as though that were what we secretly craved.\""]}, {"page": "Music from Big Pink", "response": ["Dylan offered to sing on the album, but ultimately realized it was important for the Band to make their own statement. Instead, Dylan signified his presence by contributing a cover painting. Barney Hoskyns has written that it is significant the painting depicts six musicians. The cover of Music From Big Pink was intended to establish the group as having a different outlook from the psychedelic culture of 1968.

Reviewing in Rolling Stone, Barney Hoskyns criticised the collection as containing unimaginative songs, save for \"Half the World Away\" and \"Headshrinker\". Similarly, Matt Diehl of Entertainment Weekly considered the compilation \"struttingly inconsistent\", further criticising the band's consistent use of Beatles influences. On the other hand, Robert Hilburn in the Los Angeles Times was more favourable, writing: \"virtually all the tunes on The Masterplan are appealing enough to have deserved a spot on one of Oasis' regular albums, and the best rank with the group's finest moments.\" James Oldham in NME expressed similar sentiments, finding that many of the collection's B-sides were better than the A-sides they were supporting. He continues that the collection further showcases the group's influences, overall considering it the band's \"third best album\". Reviewing the compilation in 2000, Michael Sandlin of Pitchfork gave the album an unfavourable review. He found that while some tracks, naming \"Fade Away\" and \"Headshrinker\" were better than some of their studio album tracks, the collection overall contained outtakes that were overall forgettable, stating \"some outtakes are initially scrapped for good reason\".

U2, I guess, will continue to 'move' in live performance, but they will only move on the lightest surface. Their music does 'soar'... But then 'God' knows, there are other religions\". Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone praised the Edge for his powerful guitar playing, \"drenched in echo and glory\", but said Bono's vocals were negatively impacted by him taking himself too seriously and that his lyrics were silly and clich\u00e9d. Pareles acknowledged the band's attempts to vary their sound, but said \"none of the strategies works as well yet as their basic power-trio dynamics\". In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the band \"tries too hard to move forward\" on October, with Bono straining to make big statements and the music sounding \"too pompous\".
