Batsford first tasted glory in the FA Cup when Walton held Brian Clough's Brighton to a draw before beating them 4-0 in the replay. Before the game, Clough had described the pairing as \"donkeys against thoroughbreds\", but the result from Batsford's team spoke for itself.\nIn 1974, he left to join Wimbledon, then a semi-professional club in the Southern League. He led them to three consecutive league titles and ultimately election to the Football League in 1977.Most famously, he steered Wimbledon to the fourth round of the FA Cup in 1975, having beaten Burnley in the third round, at that time one of the strongest clubs in Britain. It was the first victory by a non-League club at the ground of a First Division team for 54 years. In the fourth round, they travelled to Elland Road and held the mighty Leeds United, then League Champions, to a heroic goal-less draw before narrowly losing the replay 0-1 due to a deflected own goal from Dave Bassett.\nOnly six months after achieving Football League status, Batsford resigned from Wimbledon following disagreements with the club chairman, Ron Noades, and was succeeded by team coach Dario Gradi.Batsford then returned to managing in non-league football, first with a short stint at Hillingdon Borough FC before thriving once more with Wealdstone FC, whose squad included the future England international Stuart Pearce. In 1981-82, Batsford led Wealdstone to success in both the Southern League's championship, which secured promotion to the Alliance Premier League (the equivalent of the current Conference Premier) and its challenge cup, then to third place in their first season in the Alliance. In the 1984-85 season, the club, now under the management of Batsford's assistant and former Wimbledon coach Brian Hall, became the first in history to achieve the non-league double of being Alliance Premier League champions and FA Trophy winners.\nBatsford suffered heart trouble and decided to leave Wealdstone, but he recovered sufficiently to coach at Queen's Park Rangers, then serve as general manager of Dulwich Hamlet before running the Millwall youth team again and also acting as a talent scout for Dave Bassett during his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9's managerial stints with Watford, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest. In 2004-05 he held the honorary position of President of his first club, Walton & Hersham.He died at the age of 77 having suffered a fatal heart attack on his way home from watching Chelsea play Fulham at Stamford Bridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "AFC Wimbledon", "response": ["As part of WISA's campaign to try and reclaim the history of Wimbledon Football Club, the Wimbledon Old Players Association (WOPA) was formed in 2005.

R. Watts as first team manager in 1930, a committee would deal with first team affairs, such as choosing the team on a matchday. Doc Dowden was appointed manager in 1946, and stayed in the position until leaving at the end of the 1954\u201355 season. Les Henley arrived in his place as first team coach, and stayed at the club for sixteen years in which the club progressed immensely, winning the FA Amateur Cup as well as three Isthmian League championships before turning professional and moving to the Southern League. However, in 1971 Henley was replaced by Mike Everitt, who arrived as player-manager. After two seasons, Everitt left to manage Brentford and Dick Graham arrived as a replacement. Graham remained until March 1974, and a replacement was not appointed until July of that year, when Allen Batsford was made manager. Batsford led Wimbledon to The Football League, but resigned only halfway through the first League season. Dario Gradi was made manager three days later, but after three seasons he too resigned. His replacement was Dave Bassett, who took Wimbledon to sixth in the First Division before moving to Watford. Bobby Gould spent three years as manager before being replaced by Ray Harford, who spent just over a season with Wimbledon. After Harford, Peter Withe had a spell as manager lasting only three months. Joe Kinnear was brought in during January 1992, and managed the club until leaving in 1999 due to ill health. A season was spent under Egil Olsen in which the team was relegated from the FA Premier League before Terry Burton was made manager. Burton's Wimbledon narrowly missed the play-offs twice in a row before he was sacked.
