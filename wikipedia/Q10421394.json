He was one of that generation who bridged the gap between terminological eras, beginning his career as a centre-half and ending it as a central defender despite playing a similar role throughout.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlton Athletic F.C.", "response": ["|1971|| Paul Went"]}, {"page": "October 12", "response": ["*  1949   \u2013 Paul Went, English footballer and manager (d. 2017)"]}, {"page": "Portsmouth F.C.", "response": ["* 1974 \u2013  Paul Went"]}, {"page": "Robin Friday", "response": ["Friday's form declined after his strong debut and his personal life remained troubled and chaotic, leading him to vanish regularly and miss Cardiff matches. He was supposed to be living in Bristol, but his manager would often find on visiting his house that he had been elsewhere for weeks. Leslie Hamilton, the Cardiff club doctor, later said that he had believed at the time that Andrews was being far too soft on Friday; indeed, according to teammate Paul Went, the forward would simply leave after each match and not be heard of until he returned for the next game. \"He wouldn't even bother to have a shower\", Went later said, in an interview. \"He'd just get dressed, take his carrier-bag with his dry martini and he'd go\u2014no explanation\".", "While Hurley had been able to command Friday's respect, it soon became clear that Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday appeared one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. \"He still called me boss\", Hurley recalled. \"I can't play for that little bastard\", Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. \"You're the one who seems to be able to get me right. Can I come back to you?\" Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the \u00a328,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, \"Tickets, please!\", pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. Steve Grapes, who was standing near the forward, started laughing, leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched Grapes in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards.", "Friday was known for giving his all in any game in which he played, no matter the circumstances. Hurley later said that Friday would often become furious at his teammates for not trying their best, even in training. This strong drive to always win even extended to the use of physical intimidation to unsettle opposing players, leading contemporary critics to label him a \"villain\". Friday also employed the use of psychological tactics; aiming to spook opposing players, Friday would kiss them or fondle their testicles. Cardiff teammate Paul Went recalled that these tricks would \"completely throw\" defenders and affect their concentration. Although he was often criticised for the number of bookings and sendings-off he received, Friday believed he was justified to chase victory by any means, explaining his attitude in a 1977 interview: \"On the pitch I hate all opponents. I don't give a damn about anyone. People think I'm mad, a lunatic. I am a winner\"."]}, {"page": "Bobby Stokes", "response": ["The year would be remembered for Saints reaching the FA Cup Final. Stokes had an average league campaign that season, scoring just 8 goals and he nearly left The Dell before the cup final as part of an exchange deal with Portsmouth for Paul Went. However, Stokes changed his mind and stayed. Stokes scored against Blackpool in the fourth round in a 3\u20131 victory. In the fifth round, Saints were drawn against West Bromwich Albion and were forced to put out a significantly weakened team because of a stomach virus which affected many of the first team. Stokes was not one of the players affected however, and he scored a late equaliser in the game to draw it 1\u20131. Saints subsequently won the replay and Southampton's place in the final was sealed with a 2\u20130 semi-final defeat of Crystal Palace."]}]}}
