His son, Francis, made another lease for a term of 100 years to the same family in 1541, the lease ending in 1641. During Francis Shirley's time the manor house may have been rebuilt, or at least modernised. The lease of Ettington came to an end in 1641 in the lifetime of Sir Charles Shirley, who entered into possession of it in 1642. Extensive repairs occurred under him; a large part of the building was taken down and a smaller one constructed with the original materials. About 1740, and again in 1767, additions were made by George Shirley. His grandson, Evelyn John Shirley, made alterations in 1824. It was restored by John Prichard for Evelyn Shirley in 1858\u201363, in the advanced Early English Style."]}, {"page": "Horatio Shirley", "response": ["Shirley was the fifth and youngest son of Evelyn Shirley of Ettington Park and his wife Phillis, the daughter of Charlton Wollaston. His eldest brother was Evelyn John Shirley. He was educated at Mr. Davies' school in Streatham and became a student at Rugby School in 1820; however, his mother, in 1821, described him as \"a pleasant, droll, active boy, but would never make a scholar.\" He matriculated on 10 May 1823 at Trinity College, Oxford, where his brother James was a student. True to his mother's prediction, he was \"very idle\" in college, and she withdrew him in November 1824 to send him into the British Army, in which his brothers Charles and William were officers."]}]}}
