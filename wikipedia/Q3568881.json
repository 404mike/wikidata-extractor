Dutch botanist Friedrich Miquel described Urostigma eugenioides from Albany Island in Queensland in 1861, which was reclassified by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller as Ficus eugenioides in 1867, and it was known as this for many years. However, as Forster's name is older, it takes precedence. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective obliquus, meaning \"oblique\", although the attribute it refers to is unclear. Frederick Manson Bailey described Ficus tryonii in 1906, from a collection at altitude on Middle Percy Island in the Whitsunday Islands off central Queensland, which is now regarded as F. obliqua. Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander collected and named Ficus virginea from Booby Island in 1770, which was synonymised with F. obliqua by William Philip Hiern in 1901."]}, {"page": "Trichodesma zeylanicum", "response": ["This species was first published as Borago zeylanica by Nicolaas Laurens Burman in 1768. In 1810, Robert Brown transferred it into Trichodesma, but this was retained only until 1882, when Ferdinand von Mueller transferred it into Pollichia. In 1891, Otto Kuntze transferred it into Boraginella, and in 1898 William Philip Hiern transferred it into Borraginoides. Despite these many later transfers, it is Brown's placement that is currently accepted."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| William Philip Hiern||11/06/1903||19 January 1839 \u2013 29 November 1929"]}]}}
