He also helped Clyde to the Scottish Second Division Championship.\nIn August 1993 he was sold to Norwich City for a fee of \u00a3300,000, but made just two first team appearances, both while regular goalkeeper Bryan Gunn was suspended. He was however a substitute for the UEFA Cup games against Vitesse Arnhem, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan.With first team opportunities limited, Howie moved to Motherwell in October 1994, again costing \u00a3300,000. His form with Motherwell resulted in call-ups to the full Scotland team, although he never appeared at full international level. With Motherwell suffering financial problems, Howie refused to sign a new contract, restricting him from playing for a few months.He joined Coventry City on loan in January 1998 and finally left Motherwell to join Reading for a fee of \u00a330,000 on transfer deadline day in March 1998.

The match went to penalties, and Howie saved three of the spot-kicks as The Shrews won promotion back to the Football League at the first attempt. At the end of the 2004\u201305 season, Howie was one of only two players, the other being Stuart Whitehead, to be offered a new contract by Shrewsbury manager Gary Peters. However, he was subsequently released and was on trial with Boston United in July 2005.However, he joined Conference side Cambridge United in August 2005, where he played under the management of his former Norwich team-mate Rob Newman. He retired in the May 2006, with the Cambridge Evening News reporting on 10 May 2006 that he had retired to concentrate on his tax consultancy business.\nOn retiring he agreed to make himself available as cover for Cambridge's goalkeepers. In April 2007 he joined King's Lynn. He was cover for regular King's Lynn keeper Paul Crichton the following season, but played as first choice goalkeeper during the 2008\u201309 season.\nIn June 2009 Howie joined Wroxham, playing at Wembley for them as they lost 6\u20131 to Whitley Bay in the FA Vase Final in May 2010.Scott is currently a coach at Cringleford Junior Football Club, and has played for Wroxham alongside this coaching role", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shrewsbury Town F.C.", "response": ["Northwich Victoria manager Jimmy Quinn was appointed Shrewsbury manager in May 2003, with the aim of getting them promoted back to the Football League at the first attempt. With most of the previous year's players released, Quinn assembled a whole new squad, with experienced non-league players such as Darren Tinson and Jake Sedgemore being joined by Colin Cramb, Scott Howie and former League Cup finalist Martin O'Connor. The league title went to Chester City, but with 74 points, Shrewsbury finished third in the league and defeated Barnet in the playoff semi-finals to set up a playoff final against Aldershot Town, at the neutral venue of the Britannia Stadium, home of Stoke City. The two teams played out a 1\u20131 draw which went to a penalty shootout. Shrewsbury goalkeeper Scott Howie saved three consecutive Aldershot penalties and defender Trevor Challis scored the winning penalty."]}, {"page": "Joe Hart", "response": ["Hart did not play again until April of the following year, as Scott Howie dominated goalkeeping duties.

He was a mainstay in the heart of the Motherwell midfield in the early to mid-nineties and formed part of a famous trio containing Paul Lambert and Billy Davies in 'Well's fantastic team of 1994\u20131996. In one game on 7 December 1996, having started in his usual midfield role, he even played in goal for the last 30 minutes against Celtic when Motherwell goalkeeper Scott Howie was taken off injured.
