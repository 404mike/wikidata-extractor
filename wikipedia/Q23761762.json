Nate asked Morgan Evans to come down and collaborate on one of the tunes being worked on. Josh Eppard also joined around this time on drums. The band was a side project for Nate, Morgan and Josh, who were involved in Shabutie, Fuse, and 3 (band), respectively. Soon, Josh left to take Nate's place in Shabutie (later to become Coheed and Cambria) and Zac Shaw, a long time friend of Nate and Morgan took his place. The band proceeded until 2001 when Nate left and was replaced by Mike McCoy on bass. The band then evolved into Divest. After guitarist Dave Parker joined Coheed and Cambria as touring keyboardist Divest also went on hiatus until briefly reforming with three original members Morgan Evans (vocals), Kurt Brown (guitar) and Nate Kelley (bass)."]}, {"page": "Macular Society", "response": ["* Zac Shaw"]}, {"page": "England at the 2018 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |Zac Shaw"]}, {"page": "2020 British Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Zac Shaw || 11.31s "]}]}}
