He studied painting, drawing, design and etching at Studio 35 in Surbiton from 1957-1960 with Eric Clapton, and later at Kingston College of Art where he met Jimmy Page. He lectured at Leeds College of Art from 1967-1970. He also taught at Acton County (later named Reynolds High and then Acton High) School.\nZacron's innovation in graphic techniques laid the foundation for his creation of the Led Zeppelin III album cover in 1970. This album cover is a small component of a vast and varied body of work spanning five decades, with much of his work having a close association to rock and roll. He also designed the sleeve for Fancy's 1975 album Something To Remember.Zacron has been described as \"multi-sided and multi-talented\" with \"a robust ethos of independence and bravery, a lifelong quest for knowledge\". He was a public advocate of artistic freedom and a notable financial contributor to the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London for terminally ill children, organised by Light and Sound at Abbey Road Studios.Zacron died in January 2012 from bowel cancer, but his death was not revealed publicly until August that year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Led Zeppelin III", "response": ["Led Zeppelin III's original vinyl edition was packaged in a gatefold sleeve with an innovative cover, designed by Zacron, a multi-media artist whom Page had met in 1963 whilst Zacron was a student at Kingston College of Art. Zacron subsequently graduated from the Royal Academy of Arts and became a lecturer at the University of Leeds. Page asked him if he would help design a sleeve for the album and, on 24 January 1970, Zacron met the band at their gig at his university and agreed to do the cover. That spring, he met the band members individually and took a series of photos of each of them, which he would assemble into a collage.", "The cover and interior gatefold art consisted of a surreal collection of seemingly random images on a white background, many of them connected thematically with flight or aviation. Behind the front cover was a rotatable laminated card disc, or volvelle, covered with more images, including photos of the band members, which showed through holes in the cover; moving an image into place behind one hole would usually bring one or two others into place behind other holes. The back cover was a composite shot of the best photographs from the photography sessions. Zacron chose the images because he wanted to \"show them as the giant force they were in music\". In France, this album was released with a different album cover, simply showing a photo of the four band members.", "Zacron later said that, upon his completion of the artwork, Page telephoned him while he was in New York to express his satisfaction with the results, saying, \"I think it is fantastic\".\"Hats Off to Zacron\", Classic Rock, December 2007 However, he later thought the artwork was unsatisfactory because of working to a deadline.", "*Zacron\u00a0\u2013 cover artwork"]}, {"page": "London Borough of Sutton", "response": ["* Zacron, born Richard Drew, designer of the iconic Led Zeppelin III album cover."]}, {"page": "Sutton, London", "response": ["*Zacron, born Richard Drew, designer of the Led Zeppelin III album cover"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Zacron (1943\u20132012) \u2013 multimedia artist, writer, broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Richard Drew", "response": ["* Zacron (Richard Drew, 1943\u20132012), English artist best known for designing the Led Zeppelin III album cover"]}, {"page": "Ark Acton Academy", "response": ["* Zacron, born Richard Drew (1943\u20132012) was an English artist who designed the Led Zeppelin III album cover.
