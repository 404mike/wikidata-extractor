It was supplied from Fort Albany, Ontario on James Bay. McKay lived up to his nickname by shooting at Joseph Aug\u00e9 who ran the NWC post. From 1795, they traded with the Mandans. There were usually two trips per year, in October and January. Using dog sleds or horses, they followed the Souris River as far as Minot, North Dakota and then headed southwest across the prairie. The Assiniboines sometimes tried to block the trade and a few traders were killed. In 1796 John Evans (explorer) reached the Mandan country from near Saint Louis. Brandon House seems to be the first HBC post to hear of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. In 1809, Manuel Lisa's group arrived on the upper Missouri and in 1812 the trade was abandoned to the Americans.See \"Lewis&Clark Journals\" in references In 1806 to 1807, there were 53 men at the post. In 1807, part of the saga of Isobel Gunn may have taken place here.\"Orkneyar\" in references is one of the few sources that place her at Brandon House.", "* Isobel Gunn in Orkneyar website:"]}]}}
