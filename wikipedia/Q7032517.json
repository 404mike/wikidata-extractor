The actual scriptural text does not attest Wilford's version. As unearthed by Nigel Leask, the story goes this way\u2014Aftermath the dispersion of Babylonian, the sons of Sharma had emigrated to the banks of Nile or Cali. The Negro sons of Charma \u2013 cursed as he scoffed at Noah -, had emigrated to India and then from there to", "Egypt. Wilford claimed to had found proof of this based on the fact that \"the very ancient statues of Gods in India have crisp hair, and the features of Negroes,\" in contrast to modern denizens. In Egypt, the Semites \u2013 sons of Sharma -, by now well-settled, had expelled the Hasyasilas \u2013 sons of Charma -, into the desert, from there they populated and spread the entire African continent. Nigel Leask identifies this as a colonial construction of racial hierarchy to subordinate Egypt to India :", "According to Nigel Leask, in Francis Wilford and the colonial construction of Hindu geography, 1799\u20131822, Wilford published an essay in 1799 entitled On Egypt and Other countries adjacent to the Cali [Ca'li'] River or Nile of Ethiopia from the ancient books of the Hindus claiming to have found a Sanskrit version of the story of Noah \u2013 Satyavrayata, and his three sons Jyapete, Charma, and Sharma. Regina Akel, an author of Maria Graham: a literary biography, says Maria Graham played a part in this \"Colonial myth building that justified Colonialism by pointing common historical and religious roots between East and West.\" Regina further observes that Maria Graham in his Letters on India, repeated many of the theories proposed by Wilford; however, she added a proviso that she was not convinced of their veracity. Regina points that Graham's strategy was to build up the Wilford's image as a learned scholar and also in ignoring the scandal that erupted in India in 1805, following Wilford's own confession in Asiatic Researches.", "and Britain was somehow providential and ancient; thus, should be renewed to rescue the Indian branch of Aryan culture from the consequences of its degeneration. Wilford argued that the \"source of 'all fundamental and mysterious transactions of [the Hindu] religion' were none other than the British Isles. The origin of Indian religion and culture is claimed to be located in the remote northern islands of the Britain [that colonised India before] itself rather than in the Abyssinia or Hindu Kush,\" according to Nigel Leask.", "According to Nigel Leask, Wilford narrated the story of Salivahana that the child had born to a virgin and a carpenter, later became a mystic, and finally crucified in a Y-shaped plough. In 1805, Wilford had confessed publicly that some of the manuscripts he had been working were, in fact, forged, though, he didn't specifically refer to the Salivahana story; later, when he had published in 1807 \u2013 2 years after his confession -, he preceded it with a disclaimer as:The Salivahana story 'is a most crude and undigested mass of heterogeneous legends taken from the apocryphal gospel of the infancy of Christ, the tales of the Rabbis and Talmudists concerning Solomon, with some particulars about Muhammed...jumbled together with...the history of the Persian kings of the Sassanian dynasty.", "Nigel Leask, summing up all of Wilford's putative discoveries and later disavowing them for having been based on forged documents, Leask describes Wilford's work as:", "* British Romantic Writers And The East: Anxieties Of Empire \u2013 Author: Nigel Leask "]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2010s", "response": ["* Nigel Leask, Regius Professor of English Language and Literature, University of Glasgow "]}, {"page": "Leask", "response": ["* Nigel Leask (born 1958), British academic publisher"]}, {"page": "Dunedin Writers & Readers Festival", "response": ["The inaugural festival ran from Friday 9 May to Sunday 11 May 2014, and had a line-up including Alexander McCall Smith, Huw Lewis-Jones, Janice Galloway, Nigel Leask, Eleanor Catton, Majella Cullinane, Kate de Goldi and Julie Le Clerc.
