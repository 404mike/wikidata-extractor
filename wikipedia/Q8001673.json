This was very much the secondary competition to the Football League and while Stoke had struggled in their two previous seasons, they quickly came to grips with life in the Alliance and finished as champions. Stoke only lost two matches all season and were re-elected back into the Football League. Both defeats came in Birmingham, 5\u20132 at St George's and 5\u20131 at Small Heath and in both games they had their goalkeeper (Bill Rowley and Wilf Merritt respectively) carried off due to injury. With no reserve 'keepers available for the following fixtures Stoke resorted to utilising two outfield players, Hughie Phillips v Crewe Alexandra and Alf Underwood v Bootle in goal. Eventually Ike Brookes the Staffordshire County cricket wicket-keeper was signed for the rest of the season and played in the last 12 matches where Stoke remained unbeaten to claim the title.", "|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Wilf Merritt"]}, {"page": "Ike Brookes", "response": ["Brookes was born in Bilston and was a wicket-keeper for the Staffordshire County Cricket Club. In 1891 Stoke were suffering from a goalkeeper crisis with both Bill Rowley and Wilf Merritt out with injuries and Brookes was signed by the club. He did well as Stoke remained unbeaten and claimed the Football Alliance title and with it an instant return to the Football League. He remained at Stoke but lost his place once Rowley had recovered and Brookes joined Northwich Victoria."]}]}}
