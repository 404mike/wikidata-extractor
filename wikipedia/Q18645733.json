He joined Southern League club Bath City in 1946, and, playing at inside right, scored on his debut in the opening match of the season, a 4\u20133 defeat at home to Gillingham. In 1947, he signed for Darlington, for whom he scored three goals from eight appearances in the Third Division North, one of which came from what the West Hartlepool-based Northern Daily Mail called \"an apparently offside position\" to settle the match against local rivals Hartlepools United in Darlington's favour. He went on to play non-league football for Stockton. Franklin died in Stockton in 2005 at the age of 80.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Franklin (disambiguation)", "response": ["Sir John Franklin (1786\u20131847) was a British Royal Navy officer and explorer of the Arctic.", "John Franklin may also refer to:", "* John Franklin (actor) (born 1959), American actor", "* John Franklin (cyclist), British cyclist", "* John Franklin (died 1831), Wiltshire monumental mason", "* John Franklin (footballer) (1924\u20132005), English football forward", "* John Franklin (headmaster), Australian headmaster of Christ's Hospital in England", "* John Franklin III (born 1994), American football cornerback", "* John Franklin Bobbitt (1876\u20131956), American educationist", "* John Franklin Enders (1897\u20131985), American biomedical scientist", "* John Franklin-Myers (born 1996), American football defensive end"]}]}}
