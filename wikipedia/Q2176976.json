On February 7, Williams was interrogated on video by OPP investigator Jim Smyth and confronted with the evidence of tire tracks and boot prints at Lloyd's home. Over the next 10 hours, Williams gave a detailed confession of the sexual assault and murder of Lloyd, and also the sexual assault and murder of Corporal Marie-France Comeau and at least two other cases initially. \nThe subsequent investigation into Williams brought further confessions and revealed evidence of detailed notes and photographs stored at his home. The evidence showed he had broken into at least 82 houses to steal underwear of females, including children. This behaviour later escalated to sexual assaults and later still to the rapes and murders. He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of forcible confinement, two counts of breaking and entering, and sexual assault. Another 82 charges relating to breaking and entering were later added.On October 21, 2010, Williams was sentenced to two life sentences for first-degree murder, two 10-year sentences for other sexual assaults, two 10-year sentences for forcible confinement, and 82 one-year sentences for breaking and entering, all to be served concurrently. The life sentences mean Williams will serve a minimum of 25 years before parole eligibility. Because he was convicted of multiple murders, Williams is not eligible for early parole under the \"faint hope clause\" of the Criminal Code.From July 2009 until his arrest in February 2010, Williams commanded CFB Trenton, Canada's largest military airbase and a hub for the country's foreign and domestic air transport operations. He was also a decorated military pilot who had flown Canadian Forces VIP aircraft for dignitaries and heads of state. Following charges being made on February 8, 2010, Williams was relieved as the base commander at CFB Trenton. Following his conviction, on October 22, 2010, Williams was stripped of his commission, ranks, and awards by the Governor General on the recommendation of the Chief of the Defence Staff. His uniform, documents and military equipment were burned by the Canadian military.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deep River, Ontario", "response": ["*Russell Williams, English-born Canadian serial killer and rapist, lived most of his childhood in Deep River after he and his family emigrated to Canada.https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20100213/285787124761822"]}, {"page": "Wing commander", "response": ["* Russell Williams British-born Canadian convicted rapist and murderer and former Colonel in the Canadian Forces"]}, {"page": "List of serial killers by country", "response": ["*Russell Williams: former Colonel of the Canadian Forces; killed two women and is suspected of murdering a third; sentenced to life imprisonment."]}, {"page": "David Williams", "response": ["*Russell Williams (criminal) (David Russell Williams, born 1963), Canadian convicted murderer, rapist, and officer in the Canadian Forces"]}, {"page": "The Fifth Estate (TV program)", "response": ["* David Russell Williams", "|Canadian psychopaths Melbourne \"Lightning\" Lee, Russell Williams, Karla Homolka, and two young offenders"]}, {"page": "Canadian Newsmaker of the Year", "response": ["| Russell Williams"]}, {"page": "CFB Trenton", "response": ["CFB Trenton's former commander, David Russell Williams, was arrested in 2010, and convicted of serial rape and murder in 2010; some of his crimes were committed while in command of the base.\"DNA tests on Russell Williams murder victim took 10 weeks\".
