He also appeared in two first-class matches in India in the late 1930s, playing for Mysore in the Ranji Trophy and for the Europeans (India) in the Bombay Pentangular Tournament.  He was a right-handed batsman and a fast-medium bowler, though it is not known whether he bowled with his right or left hand. A 2017 book states that he was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and died in Bognor Regis, West Sussex; previously it had been thought that he was born at Axbridge and died at Selsey.", "link_mentions": {}}}
