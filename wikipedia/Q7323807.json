He also appeared in two first-class matches in India in the late 1930s, playing for Mysore in the Ranji Trophy and for the Europeans (India) in the Bombay Pentangular Tournament.  He was a right-handed batsman and a fast-medium bowler, though it is not known whether he bowled with his right or left hand. A 2017 book states that he was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and died in Bognor Regis, West Sussex; previously it had been thought that he was born at Axbridge and died at Selsey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Richard Ashley (1932) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of British people of Indian descent", "response": ["*Richard Ashley, cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Karnataka cricketers", "response": ["* Richard Ashley, 1937/38"]}, {"page": "Richard Ashley", "response": ["Richard Ashley may refer to:", "*Richard Ashley (musician) (1774\u20131836), English musician", "*Richard Ashley (cricketer) (1902\u20131974), British cricketer"]}]}}
