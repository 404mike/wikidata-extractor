In 1784 or 1785, Fox met and fell in love with Elizabeth Armistead, a former courtesan and mistress of the Prince of Wales who had little interest in politics or Parliament. He married her in a private ceremony at Wyton in Huntingdonshire on 28 September 1795, but did not make the fact public until October 1802, and Elizabeth was never really accepted at court. Fox would increasingly spend time away from Parliament at Armistead's rural villa, St. Ann's Hill, near Chertsey in Surrey, where Armistead's influence gradually moderated Fox's wilder behaviour and together they would read, garden, explore the countryside and entertain friends. In his last days, the sceptical Fox allowed scriptural readings at his bedside in order to please his religious wife. She survived him by thirty-six years."]}, {"page": "Regency era", "response": ["* Elizabeth Armistead"]}, {"page": "Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies", "response": ["The women's route into the sex trade, as described by the lists, is usually ascribed to youthful innocence, with tales of young girls leaving their homes for the promises of men, only to be abandoned once in London.  Some entries mention rape, euphemistically described as women being \"seduced against their will\".  Lenora Norton was apparently \"seduced\" in such fashion, her entry elucidating on her experience, which occurred while she was still a child. The \"old urban legend\" of young girls being apprehended from the crowd by devious bawds is illustrated by William Hogarth's A Harlot's Progress, but although in reality such stories were not unheard of, women entered into prostitution for a variety of reasons, often mundane.  Rural immigrants in search of work could sometimes find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous employers, or manipulated into the sex trade by underhand means.  Some entries in Harris's List illustrate how some women managed to lift themselves out of penury.  Becky LeFevre, once a streetwalker, used her business sense to amass considerable wealth, as did a Miss Marshall and Miss Becky Child, who are each mentioned in several editions.Rubenhold, 2005 pp 315-16 Many of these women had rich keepers, and some married wealthy aristocrats; Harriet Powell married Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth, and Elizabeth Armistead married Charles James Fox."]}, {"page": "George St John, 3rd Viscount Bolingbroke", "response": ["Mary later (1797) married an Anglo-German Bavarian count Franz Jenison von Walworth, by whom she had legitimate issue and descendants.
