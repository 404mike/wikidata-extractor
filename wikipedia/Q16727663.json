The artist went by the title  \"The Crown Prince of Hell.\"  He operated and curated the  Vector Gallery in New York City, which drew attention and critical response for its avant-garde postmodern multimedia narratives on Abrahamic religions. The gallery attracted controversy as \u201cThe official art gallery of Satan\u201d and purported to opporate as a sovereign nation with its own time zone, theology, and community of adherents, Vectorians.  Some refer to the gallery as a cult, and to Brine in turn as a cult leader. In an interview with V Magazine, Brine clarifies that Vector is not a cult. \"We're really a group of close friends. We have the same religion, but we practice it differently. The practice of our religion is making art.\" Brine & the Vector Gallery were often likened to a Millennial Andy Warhol meets GG Allin.The NYC location closed when Brine traveled to Tanna, Vanuatu and opened for a period on Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles. The press reported Brine\u2019s intentions to move Vector from LA to Washington, DC during the American presidential election season.
