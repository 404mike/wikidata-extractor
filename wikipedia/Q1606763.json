As the middle-class in Victorian Britain grew, it looked for ways in which to enjoy the proceeds of their efforts and the concept of leisure expanded rapidly through the population from the mid-19th century onwards. A significant interest in travel and adventure evolved and at the time McMullen was doing his experimental cruises in Leo, the \"Golden Age\" of mountaineering was also beginning, lead by British adventurers such as Alfred Wills. It is in this setting that McMullen is widely regarded as the pioneer of this new phenomenon of adventurous leisure pursuits with particular regard to small boat sail cruising. Rather than luxury and competition, the interest was rather in the coast and the sea, and an amateur learning the considerable technical skills required to competently skipper a small boat in coastal sailing, especially in very challenging weather conditions, which in itself required considerable bravery to master as well as skill. The pleasure and satisfaction derived in achieving this was augmented by the fact that such a pursuit could take the crew to previously difficult to visit coastal areas of Britain, Europe and the Mediterranean, often an important aspect of pleasure cruising for Victorian adventurers.Jeremy Evans, Sailing p.22Anil Taneja, World of Sports: Outdoors p.255"]}]}}
