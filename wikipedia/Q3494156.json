A clarinettist of a later generation, Alan Hacker, wrote that the sound produced by Brymer and his colleagues was \"expressive and instantly recognisable, even in just one solo note.\" With Beecham and the RPO, Brymer made the first of his three recordings of Mozart's Clarinet Concerto in 1958. When the recording was reissued on compact disc in 2001, The American Record Guide said,", "As a teacher, Brymer was professor at the Royal Academy of Music (1950\u201358), the Royal Military School of Music at Kneller Hall (1969\u201373), and the Guildhall School of Music (1981\u201393). Among his pupils at the Royal Academy was Alan Hacker, who like many players of the generation after Brymer was less attracted by the rich sound developed by Brymer, favouring instead more radical techniques propounded by Bruno Bartolozzi, and playing styles harking back to an earlier, less mellifluous, style of playing."]}, {"page": "Alcina", "response": ["|Alan Hacker,Staatsoper Stuttgart,Staatsorchester Stuttgart"]}, {"page": "Kenny Wheeler", "response": ["* with Tony Coe, John Edwards, Alan Hacker, Sylvia Hallett, Marcio Mattos, Evan Parker, Philipp Wachsmann: Free Zone Appleby 2003 (PSI, 2004)"]}, {"page": "Reginald Kell", "response": ["Kell moved to the United States in 1948, making a successful concert and recording career.

Recalling the significance of the moment in a 2013 interview with Time Out, he said he \"was absolutely translated\" and \"hooked like a fish\". A recording he was given the next year of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 solidified his interest; he began composing at around age 11. From 1947 to 1955, Payne attended Dulwich College where he mainly studied the classics, though he still found time to engage in music. Besides private study with Stanley Wilson, he worked on an orchestral suite and piano sonata and regularly played clarinet with Alan Hacker. Payne began further exploration of Western Classical repertoire, particularly Mozart and Haydn of the classical period and the Romantics Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Sibelius.
