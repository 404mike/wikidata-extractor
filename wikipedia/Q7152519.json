He started at Glentoran, moving on to Portadown, before signing with Port Vale in 1988. Three years later he transferred to Cardiff City, and helped the Welsh club to top the Third Division in 1992\u201393. In 1995, he left the Football League to return to Ireland, signing with Linfield and later returned to Wales to play for Bangor. He won youth caps for his country, and also earned a Northern Ireland B cap.\nAs a manager, he was appointed manager of Bangor, before moving on to Ballymena United. In 2005, he was made manager of Newry City, moving on to Glentoran the next season, and then returning to the management position at Bangor in 2007. In 2008, he was appointed manager at Larne, before he left the club in April 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glentoran F.C.", "response": ["After eight years in charge of Glentoran, Roy Coyle resigned as manager after a string of indifferent results. On 14 February 2006 the club announced that former Newry City manager Paul Millar was to take over the manager's position. Since taking over, performances improved and he led his team into the Irish Cup final with rivals Linfield. Despite taking the lead in the first half, Linfield won the game with two goals from Peter Thompson. He also led his new club to their biggest ever defeat against their bitter cross-city rivals Linfield in a 6\u20130 defeat at Windsor Park. The Glens have sought to reduce the gap between them and Linfield by signing Kyle Neill and Gary Hamilton from Portadown and re-signing former fan's favourite Gary Smyth. Also arriving was another former player, Jason Hill, former Portadown and Newry City player Cullen Feeney and promising young keeper Ciaran McLaughlin from Ards.", "Paul Millar was sacked as manager on 17 May 2007 after less than fifteen months in the job, having steered the club to two successive seasons finishing second in the League behind Linfield. He had the backing of chairman Stafford Reynolds, but the majority of the board and fans wanted his departure. The start of his second season in charge had looked promising. As Glentoran led the league summit, they were five points clear of Linfield at Christmas. Arguably ten minutes of football wrecked what looked to be a very successful campaign. Glentoran were leading Portadown 2 \u2013 1 with eighty-five minutes gone. Two late goals sealed Glentoran's first defeat of the season and ultimately led to successive defeats, and the slight climax (8\u20130 vs. Armagh City). Fans were disappointed with the style of football displayed by the team in the later months of Millar's reign.", "Mick McDermott became manager as a part of a deal which involved a group of investors putting finance into Glentoran. An EGM was held on 16 May 2019 for shareholders to vote on the proposal. 96% of shareholders approved the investment. Paul Millar rejoined the club as Mick McDermott's assistant manager. Kieran Harding remained as a coach, however Gary Smyth and Paul Leeman were not seen in the dug-out for the following matches. On 21 May 2019, Glentoran announced Smyth had left the club, a controversial decision amongst some fans. Leeman left two days later despite both being offered to be retained in the same roles and with the same benefits under the new and correctly qualified management team. On 4 February 2020, the Glentoran Chairman Stephen Henderson announced on behalf of the club, that it was finally free of external debt. Once having been \u00a31.77 million in the red, the Board of Directors had cleared 80% of the debt across the decade and prior to the new investment in the club. A combination of the investor and the old board then settled the final remaining debt with the last outstanding creditor.", "* Paul Millar (2006\u201307)"]}, {"page": "Bangor F.C.", "response": ["| Paul Millar"]}, {"page": "Alan McDonald (Northern Ireland footballer)", "response": ["McDonald returned to QPR briefly in February 2006 as assistant to manager Gary Waddock but Waddock struggled as manager and McDonald left in September 2006.

Even though Coyle played for Glentoran, it took some of the fans a while to get used to him after managing their bitter rivals Linfield. Coyle brought that success he had with Linfield and became Glentoran's most successful manager ever by winning 16 trophies with Glentoran. In 2006, after winning the league, Glentoran started to have a string of poor results. The fans started to turn against Coyle and the players. Then an away match to Armagh City saw Glentoran crashing to a 5\u20132 defeat at Holm Park. At the final whistle, Glentoran fans booed the players and as Coyle walked by, some of the fans nearby shouted \"Coyle Out!\" Coyle resigned that evening. He was replaced by Newry City manager Paul Millar.", "Coyle swapped clubs with Paul Millar who went to be Glentoran's new manager. Coyle only stayed for a couple of months and decided to retire.
