He has won Scotland's Sports Journalist of the Year award four times.Spiers grew up in Glasgow, though had spent some of his childhood in Anstruther in Fife, and attended the University of St Andrews. He previously worked as chief sportswriter at The Herald from 2001 to 2007. He then moved to The Times where has worked off and on since 2007. He was a regular pundit on the Scottish television football highlights show Scotsport, shown on STV, before the show ended in November 2007.  He also appeared frequently on Clyde 1's football show Super ScoreBoard, and Setanta Sports' Press Box. From around 2011 onwards Spiers has appeared in various formats on BBC Radio Scotland.\nHe was brought up as a Rangers fan, but has been a prominent critic of Rangers' leadership and supporters, highlighting many incidents of racism and sectarianism.\nI have always happily ignored one of the traditional and cowardly rules of Scottish sports journalism \u2013 the rule which says, always apportion equal blame to Celtic and Rangers when talking of bigotry \u2013 by pointing a much bigger finger of blame at Rangers, the club I grew up supporting.In 2007, Random House published his book, L'Enigma \u2013 A Chronicle of Trauma and Turmoil at Rangers (ISBN 1-84596-291-5) on Paul Le Guen's short tenure as the manager of Rangers. In the same year he also contributed a chapter to the book It's Rangers for me?In September 2008, Spiers wrote \"For years now Celtic Park \u2013 unlike Ibrox \u2013 has been largely free of sectarian or racist chanting.\" In the aftermath of the 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots Spiers called Rangers \"a club with poison at its core.\" In June 2013 Spiers expressed his own view that the Rangers which reformed in the lower divisions after the original company's 2012 liquidation was a new club rather than a direct continuation of the liquidated entity.In January 2016, Spiers, by now a freelance writer, was involved in a dispute with Rangers regarding alleged comments made to him by a Rangers director. The club were demanding an apology from The Herald, for whom Spiers wrote a column, while the writer himself maintained that what he had written was accurate. Although The Herald published an apology for the column, Spiers in turn issued his own statement, defending himself and saying he would not be contributing any more columns to the paper. He joined The Times a month later, though that move had already been agreed before the Herald row.\nColumnist Angela Haggerty of The Herald's sister paper, The Sunday Herald, was also sacked after she supported Spiers on Twitter.In recent years, Spiers has conducted theatre interviews at the Edinburgh Fringe, involving figures from the world of politics, theatre, the arts and sport.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hibernian F.C.", "response": ["Hibs have a traditional local rivalry in Edinburgh with Hearts; the derby match between the two clubs is one of the oldest rivalries in world football.

He called Hibernian manager John Hughes to offer his services. Hughes, who was surprised that Miller was available to him on a free transfer, offered a two-year contract that Miller signed on 11 September. Miller quickly established himself in the Hibs first team, with Graham Spiers describing him as the \"king of Hibs\" after a 1\u20131 draw against Rangers at Ibrox. His early performances for Hibs were rewarded with the SPL player of the month award for October 2009. On 20 February, he was sent off in the first half of a 1\u20130 loss at Motherwell for fouling Jim O'Brien. Despite a downturn in form, Hibs finished fourth in the 2009\u201310 Scottish Premier League and qualified for European competition.
