Tom Dalgliesh, Lance Gutteridge and Steve Brewster founded Gamma Two Games in Vancouver, BC in the early 1970s, and published their first game in 1972.  Brewster left the company soon after its formation. Ron Gibson soon joined the company but left the company in 1986. Gamma Two Games became Columbia Games in 1982.  In the mid-1980s, Gutteridge left the company, leaving Dalgliesh as its sole owner, although the two still associate frequently and Gutteridge still makes some contributions. Columbia Games moved from Vancouver, BC to Washington State in 1994 for a variety of personal and economic reasons."]}, {"page": "N. Robin Crossby", "response": ["In 1998, Robin and CGI were contacted by Auran Games, an Australian video game company interested in developing a H\u00e2rnic Internet role-playing game. Robin signed his second contract with CGI that same year. Over the next three years Auran paid for four trips to Australia including one where he was accompanied by his wife, as well as a business associate Tom Dalgliesh and his wife Penny. But tensions had been rising between Robin and Columbia Games, which had moved to Washington state for tax purposes in 1999. Robin had grown unhappy with the direction being taken with the H\u00e2rn product line and had begun self-publishing his own modules under the name Kelestia Productions in 1997. These modules and rulebooks diverged from CGI's releases as of the H\u00e2rnMaster I series. Robin released both digital products in PDF format through Hyperbooks.com and print products which were produced in Burnaby and shipped in large volume from his home with the help of his eldest daughter Arien. During this period he published nearly half a dozen products, including his own extension of the basic rules called H\u00e2rnMaster Gold. HMG was not only a new version of the H\u00e2rn universe, but a guide to campaigning with the H\u00e2rn world in any gaming system without compromising on the level of detail."]}, {"page": "Charles S.
