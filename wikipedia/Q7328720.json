Some Puritans attempted to find assurance of their faith by keeping detailed records of their behavior and looking for the evidence of salvation in their lives. Puritan clergy wrote many spiritual guides to help their parishioners pursue personal piety and sanctification. These included Arthur Dent's The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven (1601), Richard Rogers's Seven Treatises (1603), Henry Scudder's Christian's Daily Walk (1627) and Richard Sibbes's The Bruised Reed and Smoking Flax (1630)."]}, {"page": "Richard Rogers (disambiguation)", "response": ["Richard Rogers, Baron Rogers of Riverside (1933\u20132021) was a British architect.", "Richard Rogers may also refer to:", "*Richard Rogers (bishop) (1532/33\u20131597), British religious leader", "*Richard Rogers (psychologist) (born 1950), American psychologist & academic", "*Richard Rogers (sound engineer), American sound engineer", "*Richard Rogers (died 1643) (c. 1611\u20131643), English soldier who sat in the House of Commons from 1640 to 1642", "*Richard Rogers (theologian) (1550\u20131618), English nonconformist clergyman"]}, {"page": "Richard Rogers (1550?-1618)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Rogers (theologian)"]}, {"page": "History of the Puritans under King James I", "response": ["*Richard Rogers (1550-1618) fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge known for his strong Biblical preaching, whose \"Seven Treatises\" on the Christian Life were foundational to the Puritan movement."]}, {"page": "Richard Rogers (Puritan)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Rogers (theologian)"]}]}}
