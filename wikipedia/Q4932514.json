He started writing The Word for Today devotional readings in 1992 as various inspirations he had received in forty years of being involved in Christian leadership and from the Biblical principles instilled in him by his mother.

In 1992, Bob put pen to paper and began jotting down inspirations.

These inspirational readings proved very popular, and Bob was astounded by the response.", "In 2019, UCB celebrated the 25th Anniversary of the UCB Word For Today, which is distributed to over 400,000 readers in print and across digital platforms each quarter.
