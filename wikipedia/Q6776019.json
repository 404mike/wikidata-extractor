Litton's fluency of style(s) and the historical context he brings to his jazz piano has taken him around the world, playing with and respected by many of the great names in jazz, past and present. His keyboard skills have been honed by his attention to detail and personal discipline both in terms of musicianship as well as knowledge of the development of jazz piano.\nAn early review summary by Ken Rattenbury of Litton's jazz piano playing has been echoed by many critics bringing similar epithets throughout his career: 'a delicious fun thing bubbles from start to finish, with Martin Litton piano, arranger, a lyrical strider, well versed in the elusive art of accompaniment, lovely soloist, and with a rare way with ragtime'.\nLitton has been described as a stride piano expert. His Gramercy Five band recreated the small group swing style of Artie Shaw.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Martin Litton", "response": ["Martin Litton may refer to:", "* Martin Litton (environmentalist) (1917\u20132014), Grand Canyon river runner and conservationist", "* Martin Litton (pianist) (born 1957), British jazz pianist"]}, {"page": "1957 in jazz", "response": ["* 14 \u2013 Martin Litton, British pianist."]}, {"page": "Litton (surname)", "response": ["* Martin Litton (environmentalist) (1917\u20132014), American conservationist", "* Martin Litton (pianist) (born 1957), British jazz pianist"]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 1957 in jazz, deaths of Abe Lyman, Carroll Dickerson, Cripple Clarence Lofton, Curtis Mosby, Dean Benedetti, Erik Tuxen, Ernie Henry, Fud Livingston, George Girard, He Dasha, Jack Gardner, Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Shulman, Louis Mitchell, Richard McPartland, Serge Chaloff, Sonny Parker, Walter Page, and Wooden Joe Nicholas; births of Aage Tanggaard, Adrian Utley, Anca Parghel, Anders Jormin, Andr\u00e9s Boiarsky, Andy Sheppard, Annette A.
