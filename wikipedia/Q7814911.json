Born in Walsall, Staffordshire, he played for Walsall Town Swifts and Small Heath in the Football Alliance before going on to make 130 appearances in the Football League representing Small Heath, Walsall Town Swifts and Gainsborough Trinity. He later played for South Shields, Southern League club Watford, and Leamington Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Speller", "response": ["When training resumed for the 1893\u201394 season, full-back Tom Bayley had been released, but the Post expected Speller to take his place. He had played in practice matches and was \"fully confident of his ability to perform as well as ever he did\". Teddy Jolley and newcomer Bernard Pumfrey began the season at full back, but a defeat at Liverpool and a heavy defeat at Burslem Port Vale gave Speller his chance. His first game for almost a year came in a visit to Ardwick, won 1\u20130 by Small Heath. According to the Post, \"he played carefully at the start, but gained confidence as the game proceeded, and many times put a stop to extremely dangerous attacks by the clever right wing of the home team.\" He played in the next game, a 5\u20132 win at home to Grimsby Town, then lost his place to William Reynolds. At Christmas, Small Heath played a friendly at Marlow, in which Speller had \"not been seen in such form since his leg was broken\". Nevertheless, he retired at the end of the season. Before he broke his leg, he had not missed a game in League or FA Cup since the ankle injury some two-and-a-half years earlier."]}, {"page": "George Short", "response": ["Short was born in Birmingham.

In Small Heath's first season in the Football Alliance, Short scored four goals in 13 appearances playing as a winger,Matthews, p. 140. but later he became most comfortable at full back. This meant a lengthy spell in the reserve team, because first-choice defenders Tom Bayley and Fred Speller missed only two games between them in the next two seasons. Short returned to the first team for the club's first season in the Football League in 1892\u201393, contributing to their winning the inaugural Second Division championship.Matthews, pp. 140\u201341.

Others from the Football Alliance side included the versatile Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, and the long-serving Charlie Simms, who was by 1892 employed as the first-team trainer, but retained his playing registration for emergencies. Among the newcomers were back Fred Jones from Newton Heath, forward Harry Edwards, signed from Singer's of Coventry,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 124, 141. and centre-forward Frank Mobley, who joined soon after the start of the season, also from Singer's.

Tom Bayley was released, and Fred Jones left for Lincoln City after losing his place at left back to Bernard Pumfrey. Harry Morris retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Fred Speller attempted a comeback, appearing twice for the first team in September 1893, but the injury received against Darwen effectively proved the end of his football career.Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 71, 78, 85, 102, 112, 142."]}, {"page": "1893\u201394 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Of the regular first-team members from the previous season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 71.

Former Small Heath full-back Tom Bayley was one of several newcomers for the hosts, but their visitors had few changes in personnel. Teddy Jolley came in at full-back, and replacing Billy Walton was Jack Lee, who \"dribbles cleverly, and is a very dangerous forward round goal\". In the presence of 4,000 spectators, Lee scored twice as Small Heath won 3\u20131. Fred Wheldon opened the scoring for Small Heath in the first 30\u00a0seconds of their next match, at home to Rotherham Town; 15\u00a0minutes later the visitors were 3\u20132 ahead, but by half-time the home side had regained the lead. Unsurprisingly the tempo dropped in the second half, but a game played in a \"friendly and sportsmanlike spirit\" was marred towards the end by Rotherham forward Alf Pickering suffering a fracture of his right leg just below the knee in an accidental collision with Bernard Pumfrey, \"the snap of the bone being heard all round the ground\". Initial reports suggested the break was such that he was \"almost certain\" never to play football again. This was followed by a comfortable 6\u20131 defeat of Burton Swifts, in which Jolley moved to inside right in Jack Hallam's absence through illness, giving Gilbert Smith his debut at full back."]}, {"page": "Thomas Bayley", "response": ["*Tom Bayley (footballer, born 1868) (1868\u2013?), English footballer", "*Tom Bayley (footballer, born 1921) (1921\u20131996), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1896\u201397 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Small Heath suffered a predictable defeat at Hyde Road against Manchester City on New Year's Day.
