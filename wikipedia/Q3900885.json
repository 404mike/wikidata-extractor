A widely known version of the text is available through the Loeb Classical Library and was translated by William Henry Samuel James. The Loeb Classical Library offers translations of Greek and Latin texts in a manner that is accessible to those who have knowledge of the languages and even those who do not. Translations are provided in English. The W.H.S. James translation of Description of Greece comes in five volumes with the ancient Greek text included. It also includes an introduction that summarizes the contents of each book.Pausanias. Description of Greece. Translated by Jones W H S. 5. Vol. 1-5. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1918. Additionally, Description of Greece was translated by Peter Levi. This translation is also popular among English speakers, but is often thought to be a loose translation of the original text: Levi took liberties with his translation that restructured Description of Greece to function like a general guidebook to mainland Greece, which was not Pausanias\u2019 original intention. Sir James George Frazer also published six volumes of translation and commentary of Description of Greece; his translation remains a credible work of scholarship to readers of Pausanias today."]}, {"page": "Bruce Chatwin", "response": ["Between 1969 and 1972, as he was working on The Nomadic Alternative, Chatwin travelled extensively and pursued other endeavours in an attempt to establish a creative career.

In the West he was best known for his criticism of the Soviet bureaucracy and appeals for getting rid of the legacy of Stalin. He was working on a three-volume collection of 11th to 20th-century Russian poetry, and planned a novel based on his time in Havana during the Cuban Missile Crisis (he was, reportedly, good friends with Che Guevara, Salvador Allende and Pablo Neruda). In October 2007, he was an artist-in-residence with the College of Arts and Humanities at the University of Maryland, College Park, and recited his poem Babi Yar before a performance of Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 13, which sets five of his poems, by the University of Maryland Symphony Orchestra and the men of the UM Choirs, with David Brundage as the bass soloist. The first performance of the two works on the same program that Shostakovich set to Yevtushenko texts, \"Babi Yar\" (Symphony 13) and \"The Execution of Stepan Razin,\" with Yevtushenko present, took place at the University of Houston's Moores School of Music in 1998, under the baton of Franz Anton Krager. The performance was the idea of the then-President of the Moores School of Music Society, Philip Berquist, a long time friend of Yevtushenko, after the poet informed him that the two works had never been performed together. Yevtushenko had told Berquist that Leonard Bernstein had wanted to do so, but it never came to realization. The first translation of Yevtushenko's poetry into English was Yevtushenko: Selected Poems, a translation by Robin Milner-Gulland and Peter Levi published in 1962."]}, {"page": "Heythrop College, University of London", "response": ["* Peter Levi (1931\u20132000), former Jesuit priest, poet, archaeologist, travel writer, biographer, critic and Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford"]}, {"page": "Cyril Connolly", "response": ["Connolly married his second wife, Barbara Skelton, in 1950.

He seems to believe that this sonnet is Shakespeare's based on the effects that this sonnet evokes.[4] In Schoenfeldt's article he quotes the poet Peter Levi who supports Booth's view some do not want this to be Shakespeare's sonnet by saying, \"The unusual and light metre of this sonnet, combined with its trivial theme, might sway a reasonable critic to believe that the poem is early and the pun intended...I find it almost too tasteless to credit, but not quite\" (Levi 1988:40).[5] Levi says that as a poet he cannot see how this is something that Shakespeare would want credited to his work considering how different and mediocre this sonnet is to all of his other ones. Even though some critics do not like attributing this work to Shakespeare, it is hard to ignore even with its different format, the similarities it has to other sonnets Shakespeare has written."]}, {"page": "1998 in poetry", "response": ["* Peter Levi, Reed Music"]}, {"page": "1994 in poetry", "response": ["* Peter Levi, The Rags of Time"]}, {"page": "1989 in poetry", "response": ["* Peter Levi, Shadow and Bone", "* Lannan Literary Award for Poetry: Cid Corman, George Evans and Peter Levitt"]}, {"page": "1983 in poetry", "response": ["* Peter Levi, The Echoing Green"]}, {"page": "1981 in poetry", "response": ["* Peter Levi, Private Ground"]}, {"page": "1976 in poetry", "response": ["* Peter Levi, Collected Poems"]}, {"page": "Agenda (poetry journal)", "response": ["*Peter Levi"]}, {"page": "Hutchinson Novella", "response": ["*Peter Levi, To the Goat (1988) "]}, {"page": "George Pavlopoulos", "response": ["George or Giorgos or Giorgis or Georgios Pavlopoulos as known in the literature field, was born in Pyrgos, on the west coast of the Peloponnese in Greece.
