Fleming was dismissed and replaced with Collingwood Schreiber as chief engineer and general manager of all government railways. They agreed to build the railway in exchange for $25 million (approximately $625\u00a0million in modern Canadian dollars) in credit from the Canadian government and a grant of  of land. The government transferred to the new company those sections of the railway it had constructed under government ownership, on which it had already spent at least $25\u00a0million. But its estimates of the cost of the Rocky Mountain section alone was over $60\u00a0million. The government also defrayed surveying costs and exempted the railway from property taxes for 20 years. The Montreal-based syndicate officially comprised five men: George Stephen, James J. Hill, Duncan McIntyre, Richard B. Angus and John Stewart Kennedy. Donald A. Smith and Norman Kittson were unofficial silent partners with a significant financial interest. On 15 February 1881, legislation confirming the contract received royal assent, and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was formally incorporated the next day. Critics claimed that the government gave too large a subsidy for the proposed project but this was to incorporate uncertainties of risk and irreversibility of insurance. The large subsidy also needed to compensate the CPR for not constructing the line in the future, but rather right away even though demand would not cover operational costs."]}, {"page": "Quebec Bridge", "response": ["Edward A.

Around the same time, amid fears of American expansionism north of the 49th parallel and border tensions resulting from the Fenian raids, American companies such as the St Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railroad were pushing northward to connect Manitoba with the American Midwest and promoting cross-border trade along a north-south axis. One of the notable promoters of this effort was the Canadian-American railway industrialist James J. Hill, known as the \"Empire Builder\" and namesake of the modern-day Amtrak Empire Builder passenger train. Hill was the general manager of the St Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railroad, and in 1880 became part of the Montreal-based five-man syndicate who were awarded the transcontinental railway contract by the Canadian federal government under John A. Macdonald's Conservatives, and subsequently formed the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Railway construction had already been ongoing at the time under the previous Liberal government of Alexander Mackenzie, managed by the federal Department of Public Works and led by the renowned Scottish-Canadian engineer Sandford Fleming, who was dismissed in 1880 and replaced by Collingwood Schreiber as chief engineer on the project. Under Fleming's direction, the symbolic \"first spike\" had been driven at Fort William (now part of Thunder Bay) in 1875, and construction had commenced with the goal of connecting Winnipeg with the Lake Superior Lakehead in Northwestern Ontario."]}, {"page": "8th Canadian Ministry", "response": ["**11 July 1896 \u2013 20 July 1896: Vacant (Collingwood Schreiber was acting)"]}, {"page": "Schreiber (surname)", "response": ["*Collingwood Schreiber (1831\u20131918), English-Canadian surveyor, engineer and civil servant"]}, {"page": "1916 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Collingwood Schreiber, Esq., C.M.G., General Consulting Engineer to the Government of the Dominion of Canada."]}, {"page": "1893 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Collingwood Schreiber, Deputy Minister of Railways and Canals in the Dominion of Canada."]}]}}
