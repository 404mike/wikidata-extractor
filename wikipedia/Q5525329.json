A pre-season friendly played at Colwyn Bay on 10 July 2010 was the first fixture for the new club, the match resulting in a 2\u20131 victory for Colwyn Bay. The team's first home friendly was played against Aberystwyth Town, which the Blues won 3\u20130. The club's first league match was on 24 August 2010, away at Warrington Town. Rob Hopley scored the first ever goal for the club in the 6th minute, but the game ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Chester played their first home game against Trafford and won 6\u20130, Michael Wilde scoring a hat-trick. In September, Chester lost their first game after a 2\u20131 home defeat to Chorley. Chester went top of their division for the first time following a 2\u20131 win at Cammell Laird in October, before equalling their record win when they beat Ossett Albion 6\u20130 in January 2011, and recording their ninth consecutive away win at Trafford in the same month. Chester were ineligible to compete in either the FA Trophy and FA Cup during their inaugural season due to FA rules requiring a minimum of one season of prior football before playing in the Trophy, and two years before playing in the Cup. After their win at promotion rivals Skelmersdale in March, the Blues went 12 points clear at the top of the league, but a number of draws and defeats led to this margin being cut to just a single point by 16 April. Second-placed Skelmersdale then dropped points, to leave Chester three points clear with one remaining game, and a goal difference eight ahead of their chasing rivals. In a wild finale to the season, Chester were promoted by only a single point of goal difference, as the Blues went down to a shock 2\u20131 defeat at Garforth Town, while Skelmersdale thrashed Ossett Albion 7\u20132, with two goals from Ossett striker Danny Toronczak the difference between promotion and the playoffs for Chester.", "|  Gary Jones (caretaker)"]}, {"page": "2006 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["Grimsby Town faced Lincoln City in a Lincolnshire derby for the second semi-final, the first leg of which took place at Sincil Bank in Lincoln on 13 May 2006.

Two further Lincoln goals were disallowed, one for a foul and one for offside, and both sides struck the goal frames, Paul Bolland for Grimsby and Scott Kerr for Lincoln; the match ended 1\u20130.  The second leg of the semi-final took place three days later at Blundell Park in Grimsby.  Marvin Robinson scored for Lincoln with a header from Kerr's free kick on 27 minutes.  Ben Futcher, who had come on as a substitute, levelled the match in the 60th minute.  Jones then scored from a Woodhouse free kick with ten minutes remaining to make it 2\u20131 to Grimsby, before being sent off in the last minute.
