Organized copper mining had occurred on the north shore since at least as early as the foundation of Bruce Mines in 1846. The use of copper by First Nations people had been documented by Samuel de Champlain in the early 17th century, and there is significant archaeological evidence of copper working by the Mississippian people among others, who largely sourced their copper from the Great Lakes region. The western Great Lakes were the epicentre of the Old Copper Complex as early as 4000 BCE, with evidence of indigenous copper mining on Isle Royale from around this time. Geophysically, the presence of magnetic anomalies around the Sudbury Basin had been noted by Alexander Murray in his 1847\u201348 surveys. As well, in the course of charting his north-south meridian, Albert Salter observed \"severe compass needle deflections\" about  north of the Hudson's Bay Company trading post at Whitefish Lake. This drew little attention at the time, as the Sudbury area was located well inland and composed of rough terrain, and was less desirable than locations such as Bruce Mines or in Michigan's Copper Country. Within several years after the official discovery, however, mining activity had increased significantly in the Sudbury Basin, mostly by small companies which struggled with limitations in mining and smelting technology of the time. Nevertheless, this development would ultimately shift the economic focus of the region away from Sault Ste. Marie and toward Sudbury."]}, {"page": "Aspidella", "response": ["Aspidella terranovica was first discovered in 1868 by Scottish geologist Alexander Murray.See:"]}, {"page": "List of giant squid specimens and sightings", "response": ["| 29(\ud83d\udcf7) || 26 October 1873 || off Portugal Cove, Conception Bay, Newfoundland{NWA} || Found floating at surface, alive || Megaloteuthis harveyi Kent, 1874; Architeuthis monachus of Steenstrup;Verrill, 1875a:34 ?Architeuthis harveyiVerrill, 1880a:181 || Entire || One tentacle; one arm discarded || || (see Verrill, 1880a:220) TL:  [incomplete; total estimated at  with ~ left attached to body and  subsequently destroyed]; TC:  [stalk; club ]; TSD: ; additional measurements based on photograph; additional club measurement from Harvey letter;Verrill, 1875b:79 BL: ~; EL: ~ [estimate]; AL: ; AD: ; TSC: ~180; beak as large \"as a six-gallon keg\"; \"tail\"  acrossBuckland, 1875:212\u2013214 || YPM?; holotype of Megaloteuthis harveyi Kent, 1874; Verrill specimen No. 2 (\"Conception Bay specimen\") || Harvey (1873a); Harvey (1873b); Harvey (1873c); Harvey (1874a:67, fig.); Murray (1874a:161); Murray (1874b:120); Verrill (1874a:159); Verrill (1874b:167); Kent (1874a:178, 182); Agassiz (1874:226); Kent (1874d:32); Buckland (1875:211); Verrill (1875a:34); Verrill (1875b:78); Verrill (1880a:181); Verrill (1881b:pl. 26 fig. 5); Verrill (1882b:74); Verrill (1882c:5, pl. 4 figs. 3\u20133a); Hatton & Harvey (1883:238); Harvey (1899:732, fig.); Ellis (1998a:81); Haslam (2017) || \"13 December Field\"; [Anonymous] (1873:2); Harvey (1873d:2); [Anonymous] (1874:333); de La Blanch\u00e8re (1874:197, fig.); Rathbun (1881:266, fig.); Owen (1881:161, pl. 33 fig. 2); Lee (1883:42, fig. 9); [Anonymous] (1902b:6, fig.); Pfeffer (1912:19); Frost (1934:100); Aldrich (1991:457); Packham (1998); Dery (2013) || Struck by Theophilus Picot from boat whereupon it \"attacked\" the boat; veracity of account has been questioned.

In 1933, Georg G\u00fcrich discovered specimens in Namibia but the firm belief that complex life originated in the Cambrian led to them being assigned to the Cambrian Period and no link to Aspidella was made.
