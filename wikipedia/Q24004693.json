He played his first match on 4 March 1899 against Ireland and his last match on 8 April 1905 against Ireland.Six international appearances in all but only four international caps awarded due to the one cap per season rule.\nThese caps were kept for many years in pristine condition by George's descendants, before they were stolen in a house burglary in Australia and never recovered.\nAt club level, he played for Druids, Gravesend, Oswestry United, Shrewsbury Town, Druids again, Oswestry United again and finally Acrefair United.\nHe was described a \"a hard working and thoughtful player. George had a natural talent for ball control and relied on a \"scientific approach\", that is, working the ball skilfully out of defence. He played all of his football around the Welsh border country apart from two seasons at a higher level with Gravesend United in the Southern League where he made 24 appearances. In the Oswestry side, George had a good understanding with Tom Parry and the pair were regarded as the brains of the team\".\nThe Wrexham Advertiser##, Saturday March 11, 1899 described George as follows:-\n\"Richards (Druids). Right Half. An exceedingly hard working half. Never tires. Is good both in defence and attack. Follows his forwards splendidly and is not above having a try at goal himself. Knows the combination game well and gives his wing every opportunity to get away\".\nGeorge was a Welsh Cup winner on four occasions.\nHe won the Welsh Cup twice with the Druids in the 1897/98 and the 1898/99 seasons. In the first of these finals, they beat Wrexham 2-1 in a replay at the Cricket Field  at Oswestry (after a 1-1 draw) and repeated the feat the following year, again against Wrexham, this time winning 1-0 at the Hand Field, Chirk in a replay (after a 2-2 draw).\nGeorge won the Welsh cup twice more with the Oswestry United team during two spells. \nIn 1900/01 season, they beat his old club Druids 1-0 at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham to take the trophy and then in his second spell at Oswestry, in 1906/07, they beat Whitchurch by 2-0 at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham.\nHe played on until his late thirties, closing his career with Acrefair United in the Wrexham and District League.\nGeorge was later landlord of the Grosvenor Arms Hotel in Cefn Mawr, near Llangollen for many years.\n.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Richards", "response": ["George Richards may refer to:", "*George Richards (English footballer) (1880\u20131959), English international footballer who played for Derby County", "*George Richards (Southern League footballer) (active 1911\u20131913), English footballer for Bristol Rovers", "*George Richards (Welsh footballer) (1874\u20131944), Shrewsbury Town F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*George Richards (cricketer) (born 1807), English cricketer", "*George Richards (Australian footballer) (1888\u20131928), Australian rules footballer", "*George Richards (Attorney General), Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago, 1962\u20131967", "*George Richards (Australian politician) (1865\u20131915), Australian politician", "*George Richards (priest) (1767\u20131837), English Anglican priest and poet", "*George Richards (Marine Corps) (1872\u20131948), American military", "*George Richards (Warren County, NY) (active 1847\u20131855), American politician from New York", "*George Richards (British Army officer) (1898\u20131978), British general"]}, {"page": "Druids F.C.", "response": ["*George Richards (3) (6)"]}]}}
