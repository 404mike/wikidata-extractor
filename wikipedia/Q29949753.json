She is the Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics, Head of the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge.Ferguson-Smith is an authority on genomic imprinting and the epigenetic control of genome function in health and disease, and is recognised for her work on parental-origin effects and epigenetic mechanisms. Her work has uncovered epigenetically regulated processes in development and over the life course, and identified key in vivo mechanisms involved in the maintenance of epigenetic states. She also explores communication between the environment and the genome with implications for health, disease and inheritance.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics", "response": ["* Anne Ferguson-Smith (2015\u2013 )"]}, {"page": "List of University of Glasgow people", "response": ["*Anne Ferguson-Smith, Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics."]}, {"page": "The Genetics Society", "response": ["|2021-2024 || Anne Ferguson-Smith, FRS"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| Anne Ferguson-Smith ||05/05/2017||"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Ferguson-Smith", "response": ["He is the father of Anne Ferguson-Smith, Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics in Cambridge."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2017", "response": ["# Anne Ferguson-SmithAnne Ferguson-Smith | Royal Society"]}]}}
