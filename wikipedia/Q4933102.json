Both the woman and her child have needed psychiatric treatment as a result, and both have been awarded damages against the Police. Until December 2015 Lambert was a lecturer in Terrorism Studies at the University of St Andrews and a senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University's John Grieve Centre for Policing, but was forced to resign after details of his past emerged.
