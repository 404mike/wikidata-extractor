In the subsequent years this site was expanded. On September 1, 1961 this site was handed over to the German Federal Post for establishing the German foreign broadcasting service, \"Deutsche Welle\". In the course of time 10 transmitters of 100 kilowatts were installed, whereby as transmitting antennas enormous dipole arrays between free standing steel framework towers were installed. Later these transmitters were rented to the predominant part to non-German broadcasting organisations. In the 90's on the area of the shortwave transmission facility also a transmitting plant for medium wave was installed, using a long wire antenna which is spun at a tower on the transmitter site. It was intended to be used for transmission of the programme of radio Viva on 702\u00a0kHz, but it never went into regular service for this broadcaster. From December 6, 2004 to May 2006, the medium-wave transmitter was used to broadcast the programme of the German commercial broadcaster \"TruckRadio\" on 702\u00a0kHz. In 2006 the shortwave-facilities were sold to the British entrepreneur Robert Edmiston and his Christian Vision-organization. However, on October 24, 2009 the site was shut down and antennas and transmitters have been dismantled by now."]}, {"page": "Abbs Cross Academy and Arts College", "response": ["* Robert Edmiston, billionaire who founded Christian Vision"]}, {"page": "Edmiston", "response": ["*Robert Edmiston (born 1946), British motor trade entrepreneur and philanthropist"]}, {"page": "Bob Edmiston", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Edmiston"]}, {"page": "Robert Norman Edmiston", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Edmiston"]}, {"page": "Subaru", "response": ["In 1974 Robert Edmiston was finance director at sports car manufacturer Jensen Motors.
