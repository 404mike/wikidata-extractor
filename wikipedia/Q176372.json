In 1919, Breton and Philippe Soupault had used what later became the Surrealist automatism method to compose Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques (The Magnetic Fields).Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 45-46. . In 1997, \"The Magnetic Fields\" was also the title of a compilation of surrealist writing of Andr\u00e9 Breton, Paul \u00c9luard, Philippe Soupault, and others. It included the authorized translation of Breton's The Automatic Message in English by the poet David Gascoyne, whose Man's Life is This Meat (1936) (a collection of his own surrealist writings and translations of the French surrealists) and H\u00f6lderlin's Madness (1938) established Gascoyne's reputation as one of a small group of English surrealists. Gascoyne's 1935 A Short Survey of Surrealism for the 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition also expanded the movement to the English-speaking world. The Surrealist poet Robert Desnos claimed he was among the most gifted in automatic writing. Surrealist automatists, most notably Andr\u00e9 Masson, adapted these methods to art-making in which the artist suppresses conscious control over the making process, allowing the unconscious mind to have great sway. Prior to the Surrealists, Dadaists, such as Hans Arp, made some use of this method through chance operations.The Surrealists: Revolutionaries in art & writing 1919\u20131935, Jemma Montagu"]}, {"page": "Modernist poetry in English", "response": ["A number of Irish poets and writers moved to Paris in the early 1930s to join the circle around James Joyce. These included Samuel Beckett, Thomas MacGreevy, Brian Coffey and Denis Devlin. These writers were aware of Pound and Eliot, but they were also Francophone and took an interest in contemporary French poetry, especially the surrealists. Indeed, Coffey and Devlin were amongst the first to translate the works of Paul \u00c9luard into English. Around the same time, a number of British surrealist poets were beginning to emerge, among them David Gascoyne, George Barker and Hugh Sykes Davies. Like the Objectivists, these poets were relatively neglected by their native literary cultures and had to wait for a revival of interest in British and Irish modernism in the 1960s before their contributions to the development of this alternative tradition were properly assessed.", "A number of leading modernists took a more left-wing political view. Hugh MacDiarmid helped found the National Party of Scotland and was also a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. During the 1930s, he was expelled from the former for being a communist and from the latter for being a nationalist although he rejoined the Communist Party in 1956. The Objectivists Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen and Carl Rakosi were all, at one time or another, committed Marxists and Oppen spent a number of years in Mexico to escape the attention of Joseph McCarthy's United States Senate committee. A number of the British surrealists, especially David Gascoyne, also supported communism.", "As the Beats and other American poets began to find readers in the UK and Ireland, a new generation of British poets with an interest in modernist experimentation began to appear. These poets, who included Tom Raworth, Bob Cobbing, Gael Turnbull, Tom Pickard and others formed the nucleus of the British Poetry Revival. This new generation helped bring about a renewed interest in the writings of Bunting, MacDiarmid, David Jones and David Gascoyne.

Affiliated with Surrealism, but strongly opposed to its communist leanings, he moved on to become a figure in Jewish existentialism and a leading disciple of Lev Shestov. His critique of political dogma, rejection of rationalism, expectation of historical catastrophe and belief in the soteriological force of literature were outlined in his celebrated essays on Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, as well as in his final works of poetry. His literary and philosophical activities helped him build close relationships with other intellectuals: Shestov, Emil Cioran, David Gascoyne, Jacques Maritain, Victoria Ocampo, Ilarie Voronca etc. In parallel, Fondane also had a career in cinema: a film critic and a screenwriter for Paramount Pictures, he later worked on Rapt with Dimitri Kirsanoff, and directed the since-lost film Tararira in Argentina.", "By 1926, Fondane grew disenchanted with the communist alignment proposed by the main Surrealist faction and its mentor, Andr\u00e9 Breton. Writing at the time, he commented that the ideological drive could prove fatal: \"Perhaps never again will [a poet] recover that absolute freedom that he had in the bourgeois republic.\"R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, pp. 50, 154David Gascoyne, Benjamin Fondane, Roger Scott, \"David Gascoyne & Benjamin Fondane (David Gascoyne et Benjamin Fondane v.o.)\", in Temporel, Nr. 9, April 26, 2010 A few years later, the Romanian writer expressed his support for the anti-Breton dissidents of Le Grand Jeu magazine, and was a witness at the 1930 riot which opposed the two factions.R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, pp. 68\u201369, 136\u2013137 His anti-communist discourse was again aired in 1932: commenting on indictment of Surrealist poet Louis Aragon for communist texts (read by the authorities as instigation to murder), Fondane stated that he did believe Aragon's case was covered by the freedom of speech.R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, pp. 71\u201375, 136 Ion Simu\u021b, \"Libertatea spiritului creator\" , in Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103, Nr. 29/2005 His ideas also brought him into conflict with Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, who was moving away from an avant-garde background and into the realm of far right ideas. Silvia Baron Supervielle, \"L'Argentine n'oublie pas Benjamin Fondane\", in Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises, Nr. 67, January 2010, p. 5 By the early 1930s, Fondane was in contact with the mainstream modernist Jacques Rivi\u00e8re and his Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise circle.", "Rimbaud le voyou was eventually published by Deno\u00ebl & Steele company in 1933, the same year when Fondane published his poetry volume Ulysse (\"Ulysses\") with Les Cahiers du Journal des Po\u00e8tes.Daniel, pp. 627\u2013628, 641 The Rimbaud study, partly written as a reply to Roland de Ren\u00e9ville's monograph Rimbaud le Voyant (\"Rimbaud the Seer\"), consolidated Fondane's international reputation as a critic and literary historian.

It also found admirers in the English poet David Gascoyne, who was afterward in correspondence with Fondane, and the American novelist Henry Miller. Ulysse itself illustrated Fondane's interest in scholarly issues: he sent one autographed copy to Ra\u00efssa Maritain, wife of Jacques Maritain (both of whom were Catholic thinkers).Viotto, p. 111 Shortly after this period, the author was surprised to read Voronca's own French-language volume Ulysse dans la cit\u00e9 (\"Ulysses in the City\"): although puzzled by the similarity of titles with his own collection, he described Voronca as a \"great poet.\"Daniel, p. 628. For the original dispute between Fondane and Voronca, see R\u0103ileanu & Carassou, pp. 93\u201396 Also then, in Romania, B. Iosif completed the Yiddish translation of Fondane's Psalmul leprosului (\"The Leper's Psalm\"). The text, left in his care by Fondane before his 1923 departure, was first published in Di Woch, a periodical set up in Romania by poet Yankev Shternberg (October 31, 1934).Daniel, p. 598", "In the Western world (including the Romanian diaspora), there were a few authors whose work was influenced directly by Fondane's, among them VoroncaC\u0103linescu, p. 866; Oi\u0219teanu, p. 341 and David Gascoyne. Gascoyne, the author of \"I.M. Benjamin Fondane\" poem and recollection pieces on their friendship, spoke of the Romanian as a mentor, with a \"decisive and lasting influence\" on his own writings. France is home to a Benjamin Fondane Studies Society, which organizes an annual workshop in Peyresq. Since 1994, it publishes the academic review Cahiers Benjamin Fondane, which has recovered and published much of Fondane's correspondence and political texts.
