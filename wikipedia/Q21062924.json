He has co-presented three BBC TV documentaries on social insects (BBC4's Planet Ant: Life Inside the Colony, BBC2's Life on Planet Ant and BBC2's Hive Alive). Hart has written and presented numerous BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service documentaries and written more than 100 scientific papers.In 2015, he authored the popular-science book The Life of Poo about our complex relationships with bacteria. His 2020 book, Unfit for Purpose, detailed mismatches between human evolution and the modern world and was published by Bloomsbury. In 2017 he presented the BBC World Service weekly science programme Science in Action and in 2021 he presented the series Tooth and Claw.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University Challenge", "response": ["|University of Sheffield (Sid Lowe, Nicci Gerrard, Adam Hart, Ruth Reed)"]}, {"page": "University of Gloucestershire", "response": ["* Prof Adam Hart, Professor of Science Communication (2010)", " Adam Hart, Professor of Science Communication and National Teaching Fellow, who co-presented Hive Alive and has made documentaries for BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service."]}, {"page": "Chris Packham", "response": ["In 2014, Packham presented a two-part BBC documentary in which he, Martha Kearney and Adam Hart examined in detail the behaviour of the honeybee, as well as a BBC series on animal cognition, called Inside the Animal Mind, which partly featured his own pet dogs.

Sumner's lab are researching how social wasps might communicate within their colony about where resources are, perhaps like honey bees do the waggle dance.  In 2019 she published a Proceedings of the Royal Society B article on showing how social paper wasps can be successful predators of two economically important pests the sugarcane borer and the fall armyworm.  Her research on public attitudes to bees and wasps showed that the benefits of bees are widely understood but those of wasps are not, which is also reflected in the amount of scientific research into the two groups, with wasps being underresearched compared to bees.  Sumner cofounded the citizen science initiative The Big Wasp Survey in 2017 with Professor Adam Hart to raise awareness of the role and diversity of social wasp species in the UK and to compare the accuracy of citizen science data with long-term biological recording data."]}, {"page": "Anne Goodenough", "response": ["Her research looks broadly at how species interact with the environment and much of her work has been on birds.  Goodenough has researched the phenology (timing) of bird migration using data from the Portland Bird Observatory in Dorset.
