The chassis of his Chaparral 2 \u2014 it later became known as 2A to distinguish it from subsequent Chaparrals \u2014 was by design about four times stiffer than those of the leading sports cars of the day. Hall also introduced the world's first constant downforce racecar, the 1970 Chaparral 2J, which used a snowmobile engine to power two fans to reduce the air pressure between the bottom of the car and the road regardless of vehicle speed. (Both wings and ground effect tunnels generate downforce that varies with vehicle speed.) At the 1970 Riverside Can-Am the 2J qualified more than two seconds faster than the championship-winning McLaren M8D.
