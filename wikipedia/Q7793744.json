A note by Simpson claimed exclusive credit, suggesting that Burnet and Tait merely approved the final design; but Burnet and Tait exhibited the design as a joint work with Simpson at the Royal Academy; and drawings held at London Metropolitan Archives are signed by Burnet and Tait alone. Burnet was on the point of retiring owing to ill health; while Tait was a leading proponent of modern architecture, little of which is evident in the final design. The conclusion of Clive Aslet is that Lomax-Simpson was responsible for the overall concept (an early drawing by him dated October 1929 depicts the frontage very much as built); while Burnet and Tait were invited to become involved because of the prestige of their practice's name, but contributed only details.Aslet 1981."]}, {"page": "Francis Henry Crittall", "response": ["While Francis Henry Crittall funded the Silver End development, it was his second son, Walter 'Pink' Crittall (1887\u20131956) who provided much of the artistic and technical direction.

Architects who continued to employ styles informed by the past included James Robert Rhind and James Miller.

Tait, James Stirling and James Gowan. The introduction of brutalism led to urban clearances and extensive use of the tower block. The style was also used in new towns like Glenrothes and Cumbernauld, but has received considerable criticism.
