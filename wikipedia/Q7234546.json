She also originated the role of Cassie in the play Feint Traces of an Alien Being... in 1998.\nMiller did voice work as well, including characters for the Microsoft Game Studios game Fusion Frenzy in 2001.\nFor Big Finish Productions range of audio dramas, based on the television science fiction series Doctor Who, she played the part of Sister Jolene in Excelis Dawns in 2002.  She reprised the role in the Bernice Summerfield drama, The Plague Herds of Excelis later that same year.\nIn 2002, Posy recorded some video diary material for a speculative TV drama promo made by Molehill Productions.  After her death, the production team used the tapes as a centrepiece for a new script, which began filming in 2004 and co-starred many of Posy's actor friends.  The completed film is thought to be the first ever movie to be made starring a leading actor who was deceased before principal photography began.  It premiered at the Raindance Film Festival in 2005 as Sam Jackson's Secret Video Diary, and was subsequently nominated for The Raindance Award at The British Independent Film Awards.  The film was finally released on 28 December 2007, after being delayed for several years by music licensing problems.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Excelis Dawns", "response": ["*Sister Jolene \u2014 Posy Miller"]}, {"page": "Posy miller", "response": ["#REDIRECT Posy Miller "]}, {"page": "Sam Jackson's Secret Video Diary", "response": ["Sam Jackson's Secret Video Diary is a British independent film.  The makers believe it is notable for being the first film ever made whose leading actor has died before the start of principal photography. Molehill Productions Press Release, September 2005  The film's eponymous lead was played by Posy Miller, who died of acute leukemia on 24 December 2002.", "As a centrepiece, the film uses tapes Posy Miller made with Molehill Productions for television promotional tape earlier in 2002.  The television production was intended to be a one-woman microdrama shown for only a few minutes each day and presented as real to the public.  The project was kept secret to preserve the possibility of anonymity.  The tape was made up of brief fragments of the entire story and intended to be seen by industry professionals only.", "In December 2002, the project's sole actor, Posy Miller, became suddenly very ill and died a week later from acute leukemia.  The makers attended her funeral, where they met Posy's friends and family for the first time and explained what she had spent part of her final year doing.  Initially there was no question about continuing with the project, since they did not have enough material to complete their story.  But a few weeks later, the project's director, Guy Rowland, had an idea of turning it around into a film which followed the search for a missing person.", "The film premiered at the 13th Raindance Film Festival in 2005, and subsequently picked up a nomination for a British Independent Film Award (The Raindance Award).  The makers then faced a problem - some commercial tracks were embedded into the original footage of Posy, and could not be replaced.  Although Molehill had clearance for film festival use, use for a wider release proved much more difficult on the film's tiny budget.  After 18 months of negotiations, the film was finally cleared, and a release date was set for 28 December 2007 (the week of the 5th anniversary of Posy Miller's death).", "This global release followed the pattern of Radiohead's pioneering distribution for their 2007 Album In Rainbows (one of the band's songs is used in the film).  The film was available in the DIVX video format, and it was up to the individual to decide how much to pay. The film's makers stated that in memory of Posy Miller, 10% of all income they received from the download sales will go to Leukaemia Research, a UK charity.  A further 10% will go to Missing People.  The latter charity (also British) was formerly known as the National Missing Persons Helpline, and helped in the film's production.  Their spokeswoman at the time, Sophie Woodforde, is interviewed as herself in the film.", "===Beyond Fiction: Posy Miller and the Story of Sam Jackson's Secret Video Diary===", "A second film, Beyond Fiction: Posy Miller and the Story of Sam Jackson's Secret Video Diary, was released in 2007, a genuine documentary which chronicles the turbulent production.  The makers filmed behind-the-scenes footage of production tests, the casting process and filming with Posy Miller, which all feature in the film.  Also appearing is Misha Herwin, Posy's mother, who talks with director Guy Rowland about the effect of the film on her."]}, {"page": "Posy (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Posy Miller, British actor"]}]}}
