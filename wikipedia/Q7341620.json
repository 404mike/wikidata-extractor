MP, (1847 \u2013 19 June 1899) was a prominent Lancashire solicitor and an English politician.   He was one of the two Members of Parliament for Oldham between 1895 and his death, as a member of the Conservative Party. He was known as the \"Workers' Friend\" and after his death a public subscription enabled a statue of him to be erected in Alexandra Park, Oldham.\nRobert Ascroft is mentioned in Chapter XVII of Sir Winston Churchill's book 'My Early Life'. In the seventeenth Chapter, entitled 'Oldham', Mr Churchill recalls the day where Mr Ascroft, MP for Oldham, talked to him about running the constituency together. Oldham was a two-member constituency and evidently Mr Ascroft believed the young Winston -a war hero and celebrity- was ripe for the job.\n.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancaster Royal Grammar School", "response": ["* Robert Ascroft, Conservative MP for Oldham from 1895\u201399;"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Robert Ascroft", "*6 July: Oldham - Alfred Emmott and Walter Runciman, Liberal, replacing Robert Ascroft and James Francis Oswald"]}, {"page": "Alexandra Park, Oldham", "response": ["A number of structures in the park are grade II listed, including ornamental features, buildings and statues of John Platt and Robert Ascroft."]}, {"page": "Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Robert Ascroft", "thumb|120px|Robert Ascroft"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|Robert Ascroft"]}, {"page": "1899 Oldham by-election", "response": ["At the beginning of 1899, the two members of parliament for Oldham were Robert Ascroft and James Oswald.
