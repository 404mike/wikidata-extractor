He admired her \"direct manner and practical approach to life\". Graves did not pursue the relationship when he realised Machin had a fianc\u00e9 on the Front.Seymour (2003), p. 63 This began a period where Graves would begin to take interest in women with more masculine traits. Nancy Nicholson, his future wife, was an ardent feminist: she kept her hair short, wore trousers, and had \"boyish directness and youth.\"Seymour (2003), p. 59\u201368 Her feminism never conflicted with Graves's own ideas of female superiority.Seymour (2003), p. 68 Siegfried Sassoon, who felt as if Graves and he had a relationship of a fashion, felt betrayed by Graves's new relationship and declined to go to the wedding.Seymour (2003), p. 72 Graves apparently never loved Sassoon in the same fashion that Sassoon loved Graves.Seymour (2003), p. 111", "Robert Graves had eight children.

She met historian Louis R. Gottschalk, then a graduate assistant at Cornell, and they married in 1920. She began to write poetry, publishing first (1923\u201326) under the name Laura Riding Gottschalk. She became associated with the Fugitives through Allen Tate, and they published her poems in The Fugitive magazine. They awarded her the Nashville Prize in 1924. Her marriage with Gottschalk ended in divorce in 1925, at the end of which year she went to England at the invitation of Robert Graves and his wife Nancy Nicholson. She would remain in Europe for nearly fourteen years.Friedman 2005", "The excitement stirred by Laura Riding's poems is hinted at in Sonia Raiziss' later description: \"When The Fugitive (1922\u20131925) flashed down the new sky of American poetry, it left a brilliant scatter of names: Ransom, Tate, Warren, Riding, Crane.... Among them, the inner circle and those tangent to it as contributors, there was no one quite like Laura Riding.\" (\"An Appreciation,\" Chelsea 12 1962, 28.) Riding's first collection of poetry, The Close Chaplet, was published in 1926, and during the following year she assumed the surname Riding.Clark 2000 By this time the originality of her poetry was becoming ever more evident: generally she favoured a distinctive form of free verse over conventional metres. She, Robert Graves and Nancy Nicholson lived in London until Riding's suicide attempt in 1929. It is generally agreed that this episode was a major cause of the break-up of Graves's first marriage: the whole affair caused a famous literary scandal."]}, {"page": "1918 in literature", "response": ["*January 23 \u2013 The English poet Robert Graves marries the painter Nancy Nicholson in London.

He trained as an artist in London at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1910 and 1911, where he was a contemporary of Paul Nash, Stanley Spencer, Mark Gertler, and Edward Wadsworth. According to Nash, with whom he formed a close friendship, Nicholson spent more time during his year at the Slade playing billiards than painting or drawing, since the abstract formality of the green baize and the constantly changing relationships of the balls were, he later claimed, of more appeal to his aesthetic sense.David Boyd Haycock, A Crisis of Brilliance: Five Young British Artists and the Great War (2009), p.73."]}, {"page": "William Nicholson (artist)", "response": ["* Helena Moore, Hugh Casson (introduction) (1988).

Many artists are the offspring of equally famous artists. I think the additional parameter could be very useful, to help summarise important relationships at-a-glance. Note how, given no such optional parameters to use, the creator(s) of Hans Holbein the Younger had to use the \"Influenced by\" paramemeter to get his elder namesake in! Influenced by his dad, well well! Similarly Hans Holbein the Elder's Infobox says he \"influenced\" Hans Holbein the Younger and Ambrosius Holbein, although you have to read the full article to find they were his sons! Other families who could benefit from the extra Infobox parameter(s) are the Freuds (Lucien Freud and Jane McAdam Freud, the Nicholsons [[painters Sir William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde, with children including artist Ben Nicholson, artist Nancy Nicholson and architect Christopher Nicholson), the Berninis (Gian Lorenzo Bernini and author son Domenico Bernini), the Breugels (Pieter Bruegel the Elder and sons - their father apparently died too young to \"influence\" them, and thus that parameter if used would have to state their grandmother, artist Mayken Verhulst!). Artistic relatives are rarer than theatrical relatives, but they do exist! With no optional extra \"relatives\" parameters there's a potential for inconsistency, too. Take the Renoirs for example: Pierre-Auguste Renoir's \"artist\" Infobox has no \"children\" parameter and yet his children, filmmaker Jean Renoir and actor Pierre Renoir, have \"person\" Infoboxes that can include their \"father\" whenenever anyone desires to expand them from basic to full parameter boxes. Are artists' box \"parents/children\" paramemeters forbidden or deprecated, or are editors allowed the discretion of adding particular parents or children to the artist Infobox wherever it seems appropriate or useful?
