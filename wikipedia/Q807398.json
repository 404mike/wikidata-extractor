It starred Jodie Gillies as Florence, David McLeod as Frederick, and Robbie Krupski as Anatoly, and featured John Wood as Alexander, David Whitney as Walter, Laurence Clifford as the Arbiter, and Maria Mercedes as Svetlana.

Both acts took place at a single chess match in a single city (Bangkok) in the late 1980s. Florence's nationality was changed from Hungarian to Czech, with an accompanying change in the lyrics of \"The American and Florence\" from \"Budapest is rising\" to \"Prague and Mr. Dub\u010dek\". The shift in time also led to a considerably different atmosphere, and a line changed in \"Embassy Lament\" addressing the fall of the Berlin Wall. As in the British version, Anatoly defects from the Soviet Union, wins the match, then decides to return to the Soviet Union at the end, leading to the possibility that Florence's father, if he is still alive, will be released from prison. Many of the numbers from the British version were lengthened considerably, with an extended \"One Night in Bangkok\" near the top of the show. \"Heaven Help My Heart\" ended the first act, with \"Anthem\" and \"Someone Else's Story\" (sung by Svetlana with new lyrics) in the second. \"The Soviet Machine\" and \"The Deal\" were also extended considerably.
