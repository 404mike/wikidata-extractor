He was both borough engineer and water engineer to Liverpool from 1871 to 1880, and water engineer to the city from  1880 to 1890. During this latter period, jointly with Thomas Hawksley, he designed the Lake Vyrnwy scheme to supply Liverpool's water. In 1890 he established a consultancy in Westminster which designed waterworks for many UK towns. This merged with another firm to become Alexander Binnie & Sons, Deacon.\nAmongst his inventions were the Deacon waste-water meter to locate water leakage, and electrical meters to measure river flow.\nAt the time of his death he was working on a scheme to provide water to Birkenhead from the River Alwen.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lake Vyrnwy", "response": ["In 1879, George Deacon was instructed to prepare the parliamentary plans for the Vyrnwy Dam.

Dam construction with great blocks of Welsh slate started in 1881 and was completed in 1888. Hawksley resigned in 1885 because of a conflict with George Deacon who was appointed as joint engineer.
