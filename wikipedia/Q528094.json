Since then Wilkinson has gradually worked his way into the first team and after four loan moves and a number of injury problems had restricted his career. He broke into the side during the 2007\u201308 season in which Stoke were promoted to the Premier League. He helped Stoke establish themselves in the top-flight in 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 and he played in the 2011 FA Cup Final which Stoke lost 1\u20130 to Manchester City.\nHe played in the UEFA Europa League in 2011\u201312 as Stoke again finished in mid-table. He remained in the side in 2012\u201313 under Tony Pulis before Mark Hughes was appointed manager in May 2013 and Wilkinson became a fringe member of the squad. After failing to regain his place in the first team in 2014\u201315, Wilkinson joined Millwall on loan.
