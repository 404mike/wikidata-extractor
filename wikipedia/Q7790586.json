It was claimed he encouraged Kent to confess, and that he convinced her to surrender to the police.  He repeatedly denied this, although he stated that he did not discourage Kent from going to the police after she told him she would.  At her insistence, Wagner spoke to the Home Secretary Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet and chief magistrate Sir Thomas Henry, to whom Kent gave a written confession.  When the case was heard in May 1865, Wagner was cross-examined; his refusal to state what Constance Kent had said to him during her confession resulted in an \"outburst of ultra-Protestant fury\".  Public disquiet at the use of Catholic-style ritual at St Paul's Church turned to national outrage when it was established that confession was heard.  Physical and verbal attacks on Wagner occurred regularly, and Wagner's home and the St Mary's Home for Penitents were put under police guard.  Anti-Catholic Liberal politician George Hammond Whalley falsely claimed in the House of Commons that Wagner had \"got rid of\" a young resident of St Mary's Home who had left money to the Home in her will\u2014she was in fact an inmate of a home elsewhere in Sussex, and Wagner had only met her briefly\u2014and the Central Protestant Association (an anti-High Church organisation) called for the Mayor of Brighton to bring before Parliament a statement condemning the \"base and degrading confessional practices carried on ... by traitors\" within the Church of England.  A meeting they held in Brighton descended into violence.  Later in May 1865, Wagner was assaulted in the street; and on another occasion he was shot at by an unknown assailant but suffered no injury.  Only after national newspapers such as The Times and The Morning Post ran articles condemning the ultra-Protestant disturbances in Brighton did the furor die down."]}, {"page": "Lennie (barque)", "response": ["They were tried first by Sir Thomas Henry, but later by Mr Justice Brett (Lord Esher). During the trial, the remains of the corpses of the murdered men washed up on the French coast. Van Hoydonck was sent to view them. They consisted of three heads, and one headless body. The fishermen who found the heads had buried them, and were unable to locate them again. The body was badly decomposed, and had been stabbed 16 times. It is supposed to be that of Stanley Hatfield."]}, {"page": "St Thomas of Canterbury Church, Fulham", "response": ["Among its notable burials are: Sir Thomas Henry, Chief Magistrate of London; the politician Lord Alexander Gordon-Lennox and his wife Emily; Mrs. Elizabeth Bowden, benefactress of St Thomas's church and attached school, and her daughter; architects, Joseph Aloysius Hansom designer of numerous church buildings  including Our Lady of Dolours, Chelsea as well as of the Hansom cab and founder of the influential journal, The Builder; Herbert Gribble architect of Brompton Oratory, and Joseph Scoles, designer of Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street.
