The Aztecs also signed a lease to play its homes matches at the Rose Bowl for the 1978 North American Soccer League season. In the first game of the season, the Aztecs lost to the Houston Hurricane in a shoot-out after playing to a 2-2 draw. Rumor's of Best's extravagant lifestyle and various personal problems, including alcoholism, began to spread during the previous season.  After missing two training sessions and meeting with the team owners to address his concerns with the direction of the club, Best skipped the team's final practice before their 10 May 1978 match against the Oakland Stompers, and the team announced his indefinite suspension. The following month, the team traded Best to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, with the Aztecs receiving players George Dewsnip, Andy Rowland and the Strikers first 1980 draft choice. On 6 June 1978 and with a record of five wins in thirteen games, the Aztecs fired head coach Terry Fisher and replaced him with Tommie Smith. With only three wins during the next fourteen games, Smith was replaced by team Director of Personnel Peter Short for the final two games of the season. The Aztecs finished the season in last place of the National Conference Western Division, recording nine wins and twenty-one loses.  It was the team's worst outdoor season record and the only outdoor season the Aztecs did not qualify for the playoffs.
