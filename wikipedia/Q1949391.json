Initially titled Maybe '80 and renamed Rock 'n' Roll Prophet, it is a humorous spoof on the pop group The Buggles and was released in 1982 on Wakeman's own label, Moon Records. A single from the album, \"I'm So Straight I'm a Weirdo\", was released in 1980. In 1982, Wakeman hosted the Channel 4 music show Gastank with Tony Ashton that aired in January and February 1983. He then released a second album for Charisma, Cost of Living, a mixture of instrumental and rock tracks with Rice on vocals, which \"did nothing\" to improve his finances.Wakeman 1995, p. 148. Wakeman wrote about his situation by 1983, to the point where he was \"managerless, penniless and homeless\".Wakeman 1995, p. 151. In February 1983, he and Carter moved to Camberley, Surrey after the birth of their daughter Jemma. Wakeman took up work by recording the soundtrack to the official 1982 FIFA World Cup documentary film G'ol\u00e9!, which was released around the same time as Cost of Living which hampered potential album sales. He wrote the soundtrack for the film She with assistance from Justin Hayward and Maggie Bell, and his second Russell feature, Crimes of Passion, with Bell on vocals, Fernandez on drums, and past Strawbs bandmate Chas Cronk on bass. Wakeman based the music around the themes of Symphony No. 9 by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. During this time, Wakeman became chairman of the Camberley Town F.C. Wakeman also spent early 1983 writing the score to the ballet Killing Games, but problems during its development led to the project being shelved, along with a potential double album of its music. In early 1984, Wakeman completed a tour of Australia with Sky as a guest musician. He also contributed three songs to the soundtrack of B.C. Rock."]}, {"page": "Steve Hackett", "response": ["Hackett changed musical directions with his fifth album, Cured (1981). It was recorded without his band which he had worked with since 1979, barring contributions from Magnus and John Hackett, and features Hackett handling all the lead vocals. Instead of using a drummer, Magnus used an electronic Linn drum machine. Although it contained tracks in a progressive rock and classical style for which Hackett was known for, it also showcased a more pop-oriented approach. Released in August 1981, Cured peaked at No. 15 in the UK and No. 169 in the US.
