Hundreds invested their savings in supposed Poyaisian government bonds and land certificates, while about 250 emigrated to MacGregor's invented country in 1822\u201323 to find only an untouched jungle; more than half of them died. Seen as a contributory factor to the \"Panic of 1825\", MacGregor's Poyais scheme has been called one of the most brazen confidence tricks in history.\nFrom the Clan Gregor, MacGregor was an officer in the British Army from 1803 to 1810; he served in the Peninsular War. He joined the republican side in the Venezuelan War of Independence in 1812, quickly became a general and, over the next four years, operated against the Spanish on behalf of both Venezuela and its neighbour New Granada. His successes included a difficult month-long fighting retreat through northern Venezuela in 1816. He captured Amelia Island in 1817 under a mandate from revolutionary agents to conquer Florida from the Spanish, and there proclaimed a short-lived \"Republic of the Floridas\". He then oversaw two calamitous operations in New Granada during 1819 that each ended with his abandoning British volunteer troops under his command.\nOn his return to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he described as a developed colony with a community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he had put in charge of the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a variation on the scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 4", "response": ["*1845 \u2013 Gregor MacGregor, Scottish soldier and explorer (b. 1786)"]}, {"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Gregor MacGregor (1786\u20131845), adventurer, coloniser, land speculator and soldier who fought in South America during the Spanish American wars of independence, before later helping to colonise parts of the continent"]}, {"page": "Micronation", "response": ["*Several recent publications have dealt with the subject of particular historical micronations, including Republic of Indian Stream (University Press), by Dartmouth College geographer Daniel Doan, The Land that Never Was, about Gregor MacGregor and the Principality of Poyais, by David Sinclair (Review, 2003, ) and An Australian Monarch about the Principality of Hutt River by William Pitt (CopyRight Publishing, )."]}, {"page": "1820s", "response": ["* August 18, 1825 \u2013 Gregor MacGregor issues a \u00a3300,000 loan with 2.5% interest through the London bank of Thomas Jenkins & Company.
