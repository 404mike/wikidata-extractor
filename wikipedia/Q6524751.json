Diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 16, at the time he was playing youth football for Little Common. He went on to spend over seven years in non-League with Sidley United, Eastbourne United, Hailsham Town, Lewes and Tonbridge Angels, whilst also working as a care worker. He turned professional at Brentford in July 2009, entering the English Football League at the age of 24. He was voted Brentford Player of the Year in 2010, and played on the losing side in the 2011 League Trophy Final. He joined Gillingham on a loan move that was made permanent in January 2013, and helped the club to win promotion as League Two champions at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. He moved on to Cambridge United in May 2015, and was named as the club's Player of the Year at the end of the 2015\u201316 season.

Incoming were mostly free transfer signings and included promoted Wycombe Wanderers goalkeeper Scott Brown, Cambridge United captain centre-half Leon Legge, 30-year old Carlisle United central midfielder Luke Joyce and troubled but talented Peterborough United striker Ricky Miller (signed for an undisclosed fee); also arriving were Alfreton Town winger Brendon Daniels, Aldershot Town Player of the Year Manny Oyeleke, The New Saints centre-back Connell Rawlinson, Gateshead defender Theo Vassell, Stevenage midfielder Tom Conlon, and former AFC Bournemouth loanee Ben Whitfield, whilst former fan's favourite Louis Dodds, teenage striker Idris Kanu, forward Scott Quigley, full-back Mitch Clark and midfielder Lewis Hardcastle also joined on season-long loan deals. The team had an indifferent start to the season, with the highlight being a 1\u20130 victory at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 22 September. Having seen their team pick up just seven points from an available 27 in November and December, a section of travelling supporters booed and heckled Aspin during a 1\u20131 draw at Lincoln City on New Year's Day; Aspin reacted badly to the fan's \"lack of respect\" towards him and considered quitting his role, but said that he decided to stay because he had the support of the players and chairman Norman Smurthwaite. However he tendered his resignation on 30 January, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch. I fully accept results from December have been poor and expected to be higher up the table and know the players are capable of doing that.\""]}, {"page": "Tom Pope", "response": ["New manager John Askey confirmed that Pope would continue in his role as club captain in July 2019. He was mainly used as a substitute at the start of the 2019\u201320 season, but started in his 500th game as a professional footballer in a 2\u20132 home draw with Mansfield Town on 21 September. On having to regularly sit on the bench, he went on to say \"it has been the lowest point of my career really\". He scored a brace in a 3\u20131 home win over Morecambe on 5 October to earn himself a place on the EFL team of the week. However, later that month he lost the club captaincy to Leon Legge after being increasingly started from the substitute's bench. On 30 November, Pope scored an eight-minute hat-trick to secure a 3\u20131 victory over Cheltenham Town in the FA Cup second round. In the following round he scored his 109th Port Vale goal, making him the outright second-highest goalscorer in the club's history (behind Wilf Kirkham), in a 4\u20131 defeat to Premier League champions Manchester City on 4 January. This was later named as Port Vale's goal of the season. He had previously criticised Manchester City and England centre-back John Stones on Twitter, saying he'd \"get 40 a season\" playing against Stones every week, and after the game tweeted that \"I was completely wrong and bang out of order to say I'd score 40 a season..... it's more like 50.\" The following month he was named in Port Vale's best XI of the 2010s by local newspaper The Sentinel. On 5 January, he tweeted a World War III prediction that \"We invade Iran then Cuba then North Korea then the Rothchilds are crowned champions of every bank on the planet\"; the FA concluded that these remarks amounted to Antisemitic canard and handed him a \u00a33,500 fine and a six game ban to start at the beginning of the 2020\u201321 season. The club announced that they would appeal the ban, adding that \"the Commission did not find that Mr. Pope had been intentionally discriminatory and noted that the FA had not alleged any such intent on his part\"."]}, {"page": "Shaun Brisley", "response": ["On 30 August 2019, he signed for League Two side Port Vale on a one-year contract. He was signed by manager John Askey, who was his former youth-team manager at Macclesfield, but had to spend his first month with the \"Valiants\" building his fitness before taking his place on the bench as Leon Legge and Nathan Smith had established an effective centre-back partnership together. Injury to Smith allowed him a run in the first-team in late January and he quickly impressed with his performances, scoring the opening goal in a 3\u20132 victory at Forest Green Rovers on 11 February. His good form continued to keep Smith out of the first-team until his run of six matches was ended by a knee injury picked up in a 2\u20132 draw with Walsall on 22 February, a medial ligament problem which required five weeks of rest. He was nominated for the PFA League Two Player of the Month award for February. He was signed a new one-year contract after he ended the 2019\u201320 campaign with one goal in 14 appearances."]}]}}
