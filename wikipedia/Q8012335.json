Another significant appropriation of its form \u2013 the square plan with a neoclassical design and tower \u2013 is Parliament House, Melbourne (1856), as are other colonial examples such as Parliament House, Adelaide (1880s), and in South Africa, Cape Town City Hall (1893) and Durban City Hall (1885). Additionally, many Americans reportedly travelled to Leeds especially to see the Town Hall after its opening, which some venerated as highly as medieval cathedrals. The composition of a building with end pavilions and a dominating central tower was adopted for example at Philadelphia City Hall (John McArthur Jr., 1871\u20131901), which has struck architectural historians as the ultimate expansion of Brodrick's idea of a domed tower, crowned with a great statue of William Penn, while the first design for the New York State Capitol followed a similar layout and a tower which featured a close resemblance to Leeds Town Hall's."]}, {"page": "List of British architects", "response": ["*William Hill (1827/8\u20131889)"]}, {"page": "List of city and town halls in England", "response": ["|Grade II* listed ().Architect: William Hill of Leeds.
