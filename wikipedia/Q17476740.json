Born in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, Alsop is a left-handed batsman who plays as a wicket-keeper.\nTipped for a bright future and a big talent, Alsop was educated at Lavington School. Alsop has played for the Hampshire Cricket Academy in the Southern Premier Cricket League since 2010; during this time Alsop has finished within the top three averages of the league on more than one occasion. In the 2014 season he finished with the highest average in the league, 86.71, scoring 609 runs in just nine innings. In January 2013 he was called up to the England Under-19 following an injury to captain Shiv Thakor, playing four Youth One Day Internationals against South Africa Under-19s during the tour. In May 2013, he played two Minor Counties Trophy matches for Wiltshire against Lincolnshire and Suffolk. In that same month he was required as a substitute wicket-keeper for Hampshire in their Yorkshire Bank 40 match against Lancashire following an injury during the warm-up to Adam Wheater. During this YB40 game Alsop took a smart catch behind the stumps to dismiss Croft. For the start of the 2014 season, Alsop was awarded a development contract with Hampshire.  This was a result of impressing against a strong Surrey attack in a pre-season friendly. Later in the season he made his senior debut in a  List A match against Gloucestershire, however he was run-out for a duck by Craig Miles. The following day he made his Youth Test debut for England Under-19s against South Africa Under-19s, having been called up to the under-19 Test squad earlier in July. Alsop went on to impress immensely with the bat during the summer series against South Africa scoring 107 off 83 balls at Trent bridge, and then went on to score a half century the next day.\nAlsop is the 528th player to have played for Hampshire and on 15.9 2014 he made his first-class debut against Kent at the Ageas Bowl. He was also a member of the 2014 LV county championship division two winning side in Cardiff.\nAt the end of the 2016 season, Alsop was selected for the upcoming England Lions tour to the UAE and Sri Lanka in the new year. In Sri Lanka he shared a record partnership with Daniel Bell-Drummond in the fourth ODI.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|9|| Tom Alsop* ||  ||  || Left-handed || Slow left-arm orthodox ||"]}, {"page": "Alsop", "response": ["*Tom Alsop (born 1995), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire County Cricket Club Twenty20 cricket records", "response": ["|Tom Alsop|||| 793"]}, {"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club in 2017", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|9|| Tom Alsop ||  ||  || Left-handed || Slow left-arm orthodox || Occasional wicketkeeper"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1978\u2013)", "response": ["* Tom Alsop (2017) : T.
