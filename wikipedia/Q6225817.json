He was born in East Grinstead and died in Westminster.\nCharlwood made three first-class appearances during the 1890 season, while he was still a mere nineteen years old - his debut coming against Marylebone Cricket Club. While Jesse Hide hit four wickets in four balls for Sussex, all but two batsmen in the entire match were stuck on single-figure scores.\nIn the following fortnight, Charlwood played two County Championship matches, one a sound thrashing at the hands of Nottinghamshire, which included a first-innings second-wicket partnership of 398 from Arthur Shrewsbury and Billy Gunn, and the second, a pleasing victory against WG Grace's Gloucestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlwood (name)", "response": ["*John Charlwood (1871\u20131923), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Charlwood, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Charlwood"]}]}}
