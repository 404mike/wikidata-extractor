This resistance focused on two things: the King's right to demand military service, and his right to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, Earl Marshal Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King; if the King intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony. In July, Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and Constable of England, drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances, in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced.. Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy. This one was particularly provocative, because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates, rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament. While Edward was in Winchelsea, preparing for the campaign in Flanders, Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax. As the King left the country with a greatly reduced force, the kingdom seemed to be on the verge of civil war. What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause. Edward signed the Confirmatio cartaruma confirmation of Magna Carta and its accompanying Charter of the Forestand the nobility agreed to serve with the King on a campaign in Scotland."]}, {"page": "Duke of Norfolk", "response": ["Before the Dukes of Norfolk, there were the Bigod Earls of Norfolk, starting with Roger Bigod from Normandy (died 1107).

It mainly traded in timber and bark from the Wye Valley, and with Bristol.  From mediaeval times, Chepstow was the largest port in Wales; its ships sailed as far as Iceland and Turkey, as well as to France and Portugal, and the town was known for its imports of wine."]}, {"page": "Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk", "response": ["Roger had no children, and was succeeded by his nephew Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk (1245-1306)."]}, {"page": "John II, Count of Holland", "response": ["# Alice or Alix (d. 26 October 1317), who married 1290 Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, by whom she had no issue."]}, {"page": "Hugh Bigod (Justiciar)", "response": ["*Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who married firstly Aline Basset, and secondly Alice of Hainault, but had no issue by either marriage.", "*John Bigod, a cleric, who was heir to his elder brother, Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk."]}, {"page": "Eleanor of Castile", "response": ["Their household records witness incidents that imply a comfortable, even humorous, relationship.
