He scored 29 goals from 216 appearances in the Football League.Thirlaway was born in Washington, which was then in County Durham. He began his career at non-league side Usworth Colliery before moving into league football when he signed for West Ham United in 1921. He spent three years at the club before moving to Southend United in 1924. His stay at the club was short and he went on to play for another three clubs in the next two years, namely Luton Town, South Shields and Birmingham.\nIn March 1927 he joined Cardiff City, making his debut in a 2\u20132 draw with Sunderland. Thirlaway had joined the club during the season that they would go on to win the FA Cup, but he was unable to play any part in the triumph as he had made an appearance in the competition for Birmingham before joining Cardiff. He was able to play in the Charity Shield win, when Cardiff beat Corinthians 2\u20131. He left the club at the end of the 1928\u201329 season and returned to non-league football with Tunbridge Wells Rangers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tunbridge Wells F.C.", "response": ["*Billy Thirlaway"]}, {"page": "Ernie Curtis", "response": ["Curtis had previously played in all five matches en route to the club reaching the 1927 FA Cup Final but his injury meant he was unlikely to play in the final. However Harry Wake, who had replaced Curtis in the semi-final, suffered an injury in a league match two weeks before the final which ruled him out. Billy Thirlaway, who had covered Curtis' absence in the league, was also ruled out as he was cup-tied for the game having played in the earlier rounds of the competition for his former club. Curtis was therefore brought back into the starting lineup for the final, becoming the youngest ever player to have appeared in an FA Cup final at the age of 19 years and 317 days. Cardiff went on to beat Arsenal 1\u20130 in the final to become the only team from outside England to win the competition as of 2021. He also helped the club win the Welsh Cup in his first season, defeating Rhyl 2\u20130 in the final.

He kept his place for a couple of months before Linley took over, and then returned to the side for the last month of the season, during which he scored twice. Inconsistency meant he never established himself as a first-team regular. Over the next two seasons, he shared the position with players including Ernie Islip, Jack Russell and Billy Thirlaway, taking his appearance total to 60, of which all but one were made in league matches, with 9 goals."]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Keenor was restored to the side for the club's first match in February and helped secure a 1\u20130 victory over Bolton, with Len Davies scoring Cardiff's winning goal. A 1\u20131 draw with Manchester United was followed by a 2\u20131 defeat of West Brom. A 3\u20131 defeat away to Sheffield United briefly derailed Cardiff's improved form but the side continued to see a marked improvement in results. They were aided by the arrival of forward Billy Thirlaway from Birmingham, a signing which allowed Stewart to move Ferguson to his natural centre-forward position, having been used to cover there since Willie Davies had been ruled out. Thirlaway made his debut on 12 March in a 2\u20132 draw with Sunderland, with Irving scoring both of Cardiff's goals. Ferguson rediscovered his goalscoring form after being switched and added a brace in a 2\u20130 win over Derby the following week in front of 10,057 spectators, the lowest league crowd of the season at Ninian Park. He added another in a 2\u20131 victory over Bury on 19 March, McLachlan scoring the other, and scored another brace in a 2\u20130 defeat of Huddersfield. These results meant Cardiff had lost only once since mid-January, winning five and drawing the remaining four of their previous ten fixtures, and had elevated the side to 12th place by the end of March."]}, {"page": "1927 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["The second half began with a speedy Cardiff attack. Corinthian countered, resulting in shots from both Claude and Gilbert Ashton within 15 seconds of each other. Another Cardiff attack resulted in Ferguson missing the goal from a few feet out once again. After four minutes in the second half, Corinthians attacked once more. Fred Ewer played it down the left wing to Kenneth Hegan, who passed it into the centre towards Gilbert Ashton, who fired it past Farquharson. Shortly after the restart, Billy Thirlaway appeared to be about to score a certain goal for Cardiff, but was charged down by Russell. Further chances came in rapid succession; for Cardiff, Ferguson struck the crossbar with one shot; then for Corinthian, Claude Ashton passed forward to Jenkins, who struck it wide of an open goal mouth. Hegan sent the ball over the bar, and then a further shot by Claude Ashton was charged down.", "|FL || Billy Thirlaway"]}, {"page": "Thirlaway", "response": ["* Billy Thirlaway (1896\u20131983), English footballer"]}, {"page": "William Thirlaway", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Thirlaway"]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Cardiff began the season with a home fixture against Bolton Wanderers at Ninian Park which attracted a crowd of more than 24,000. Goals from George McLachlan and Len Davies secured a winning start to the campaign with a 2\u20131 victory. The win prompted an unbeaten start to the campaign for Cardiff who recorded four consecutive draws in their following games. Beginning with a 3\u20133 draw with Sheffield Wednesday, with Ernie Curtis, Billy Thirlaway and the previous season's top goalscorer Ferguson all scoring their first of the season, the run continued with a goalless draw with Blackburn Rovers and 1\u20131 draws with Middlesbrough and Blackburn again in the reverse fixture. Ferguson added a brace during a 3\u20131 victory over Birmingham City on 17 September and was among the scorers a week later during another 3\u20131 win over league leaders and reigning First Division champions Newcastle United, in a match which attracted a season high home crowd of 30,590 at Ninian Park. The defeat was the first Newcastle had suffered during the season and moved Cardiff into second place, with The Times picking Keenor out for praise in restricting the play of the opposition's leading forward Hughie Gallacher."]}, {"page": "1928\u201329 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Ferguson scored a brace on 10 September during a 3\u20132 win over West Ham United, with Billy Thirlaway also scoring his first of the season. Stan Davies scored his first goal for the club following his transfer in the next match, but was unable to stop the side losing 3\u20131 to Sheffield United. Ferguson continued his scoring streak with a goal in a 1\u20131 draw in the reverse fixture with West Ham on 17 September and another during a 4\u20130 win over Bury five days later, taking his tally to ten goals in the opening seven games of the campaign to help his side to fifth place. However, Cardiff's positive start quickly ended as the first team encountered an injury crisis. Already without Tom Watson since the start of the season, Cardiff lost both Ferguson and Jimmy Nelson to injury in their next two games, defeats to Aston Villa and Leicester City. Nelson's injury ultimately ended his season, as he appeared only two more times that year, while Ferguson was plagued by injury, missing more than half of the remaining matches."]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Goalscoring proved an increasing issue for the side; in their next three fixtures Cardiff scored only once, Francis Harris adding his third goal of the season during a 1\u20130 victory over Barnsley on 19 October. Either side of the win, they suffered defeats, first against Blackpool and later Bradford Park Avenue. This prompted Stewart to make several changes to his side, with George McLachlan, Albert Miles and Billy Thirlaway all restored to the starting line-up. The trio all made an impact as Cardiff defeated West Bromwich Albion 3\u20132 on 2 November, with Miles and Thirlaway scoring either side of Len Davies. Miles scored again a week later, during a 2\u20131 win over Tottenham Hotspur, as Cardiff recorded consecutive victories for the first time during the campaign. He opened the scoring before Matt Robinson scored the winning goal with his first for the club. Their winning form extended to a third match, a 5\u20132 victory over Southampton in which Thirlaway scored a hat-trick at Ninian Park, before a defeat to Millwall broke the streak by recording a 2\u20130 win on 28 November."]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Before the new season, Jimmy Nelson was sold to Newcastle United for \u00a37,000 after nine years with Cardiff. Billy Thirlaway was also sold to Tunbridge Wells. The club's board also approached captain Fred Keenor about reducing his wages, which were still at the same level as they had been during their First Division seasons. Keenor had been earning \u00a38 a week, but the new deal reduced this to \u00a36 a week during the season and \u00a34 a week during the summer. The board hoped the reduction would force Keenor to move elsewhere, avoiding any criticism from fans over selling him. Keenor however was keen to remain in Cardiff and accepted the new terms. Billy Hardy, who had been with the club since 1912, was appointed to a player-coach role."]}]}}
