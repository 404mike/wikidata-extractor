While he is better known as a writer than a performer, he continues to perform music despite cycling injuries. He is organist of St Mary's, Hendon, a church in the London suburbs.In 2014 he was one of a number of British critics accused of sexism in their reviews of the mezzo-soprano Tara Erraught, who was singing the title role in a new production of Der Rosenkavalier.Writing in the August 2020 edition of BBC Music Magazine, Morrison called for the dropping of three nationalistic songs, \"Jerusalem\", \"Rule, Britannia!\" and \"Land of Hope and Glory\", from the Last Night of the Proms, the last two being in his opinion \"bordering on incendiary\" in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Times", "response": ["The Times main supplement, every day, is the times2, featuring various columns.

The latter aimed at setting up a first-rate ensemble for opera and concert performances and, though no admirer of broadcasting, he was willing to negotiate with the BBC if this gave him what he sought. Reith's concern was that the BBC should have a first-rate radio orchestra. The critic Richard Morrison writes: Reith's BBC of the 1920s was ... imbued with an almost religious zeal for \"enlightening\" the public through the magical medium of the wireless. An orchestra, and particularly one that was unencumbered by commercial constraints and thus free to deliver the highest of highbrow programmes, would fit very well into that idealistic philosophy.Morrison, p. 72 Landon Ronald brought Reith and Beecham together in April 1928; negotiations and preliminary arrangements continued for more than 18 months until it became clear that the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities for the proposed new ensemble.
