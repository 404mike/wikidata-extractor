Wallace was initially convicted of the bizarre murder of his wife Julia, and sentenced to death, but in a unique legal decision the verdict was quashed on Appeal, because the weight of the evidence did not support it, and Wallace was freed. Scholefield Allen was appointed a King's Counsel in June 1945. He served as Recorder of Blackburn between 1947 and 1970.\nHe was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Crewe at the 1945 general election, defeating the Conservative Home Secretary, Sir Donald Somervell, and held the seat until he retired at the February 1974 general election, a month before his death. His successor as MP was Gwyneth Dunwoody. He was married to Mona (n\u00e9e Irving) and they had two sons, John (advisor to Harold Wilson) and David.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: A", "response": ["|Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "Alastair Goodlad", "response": ["Goodlad first stood for Parliament in 1970 when he contested Crewe, but was beaten by Labour's Scholefield Allen."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Scholefield Allen, Crewe, 1945\u201374"]}, {"page": "Crewe (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "Sydney Scholefield Allen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Scholefield Allen"]}, {"page": "Sydney Allen", "response": ["#Redirect Scholefield Allen"]}]}}
