Wallace was initially convicted of the bizarre murder of his wife Julia, and sentenced to death, but in a unique legal decision the verdict was quashed on Appeal, because the weight of the evidence did not support it, and Wallace was freed. Scholefield Allen was appointed a King's Counsel in June 1945. He served as Recorder of Blackburn between 1947 and 1970.\nHe was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Crewe at the 1945 general election, defeating the Conservative Home Secretary, Sir Donald Somervell, and held the seat until he retired at the February 1974 general election, a month before his death. His successor as MP was Gwyneth Dunwoody. He was married to Mona (n\u00e9e Irving) and they had two sons, John (advisor to Harold Wilson) and David.", "link_mentions": {}}}
