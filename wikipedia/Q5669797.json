His previous first team appearance had been against Nottingham Forest on cup final day of the previous season. He also played in the next match a draw away to Port Vale.

He made his senior debut on 13 September 1948 against Mansfield Town in the Third Division North. Although the team continued to struggle, Breaks did not. Over the next seven seasonsfour as a first-team regularhe made 179 appearances in the Football League Third Division North, and was spoken of as a possible replacement at Southampton after Alf Ramsey's move to Tottenham Hotspur. He scored once, when he injured a knee against Crewe Alexandra in 1950: unable to play in defence, he was still able to wander about the forward line. He shared a benefit match with the equally long-serving David McCormick in April 1955, in which Halifax Town lost 10\u20134 to a Football League Select XI which included their own player-manager, Willie Watson. Breaks became reserve-team coach in 1956, and acted as first-team trainer after Alan Ure retired in January 1962. After manager Harry Hooper also left the club, Breaks followed suit during the 1962 close season."]}]}}
