From St Edmund's he went up to Hertford College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket for Oxford University in 1958 and 1959, making five appearances. His matches for Oxford were mostly trials, with Pettit handed his first trial match against Derbyshire due to the unavailability of J. A. Bailey and David Sayer, where he was employed as a new ball bowler. He was expensive and did not take a wicket and did not feature for Oxford until the following year, when he played four matches in a row, which included an appearance against the touring Indians. However, he only took 6 wickets in these matches at an expensive average of 62.00. "]}]}}
