He was a member of the Postgate family.\nBorn in Birmingham, the son of John Postgate, he was educated at King Edward's School where he became head boy. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge where he read classics, being elected a Fellow in 1878. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1886.He established himself as a creative editor of Latin poetry with published editions of Propertius, Lucan, Tibullus and Phaedrus. His major work was the two-volume Corpus Poetarum Latinorum, a triumph of editorial organisation.  An influential work was his often reprinted \"The New Latin Primer\", 1888, much used in British schools over subsequent decades. While at Cambridge, he edited the Classical Review and the Classical Quarterly while holding the chair of comparative philology at University College, London. In 1909, reconciled that the Cambridge Chair would go to A. E. Housman, as it did in 1911, Postgate opted to become Professor of Latin at Liverpool.\nHe retired to Cambridge in 1920.

Among more modern editions Emil Baehrens (1878, the first of the modern critical editions) has outlived his contemporaries Lucian M\u00fcller (1870), Heinrich Dittrich (1881), Edward Hiller (1885) and John Percival Postgate (1905). Guy Lee's edition and translation of books 1-2 (Cambridge, 1975) is based on a fresh collation of A. Of the commentaries Heyne's and Huschke's are still of value. The greater part of the poems are included in Postgate's Selections (with English notes, 1903).
