Watford player Joe Davison was later sent off in that game with the referee reportedly saying \"Off you go, Barson\". In late September Barson was sent off in a home game against Fulham. After entangling legs with Fulham's Temple, Barson was adjudged to have kicked out at him, although both Watford and Fulham players argued that it had not happened. Although a petition of 5,000 signatures arguing Barson's unfair treatment was presented to the FA by Watford's mayor, Barson was suspended for six months. Watford's chairman, John Kilby, spoke out against the decision, citing that a player had recently been suspended for three months for striking a referee. Barson's case was argued for in local and national newspapers, but the revelation that the petition had been burnt at the FA headquarters caused the affair to die down. The suspension stopped Barson from participating in the remainder of the season, and he was released from his contract."]}, {"page": "Joe Davison (footballer, born 1919)", "response": ["Joe Davison (29 July 1919\u00a0\u2013 1983) was an English footballer who made 240 appearances in the Football League playing as a full back for Darlington in the years following the Second World War.
