In 1852 they moved to 47 (and later to 14) Ludgate Hill, where, with the aid of David Bogue, an American department was opened. In 1856 Edward Marston became a partner, and Bogue retired. The firm removed in 1867 to 188 Fleet Street, in 1887 to St. Dunstan's House, Fetter Lane, and subsequently to Paternoster Row. The firm issued works by authors such as William Black, William Henry Boulton, ECR Lorac, Julius Mendes Price, Nikolay Przhevalsky, Henry Morton Stanley, and Jules Verne. It also published the photographic work of Polish Count Stanis\u0142aw Julian Ostror\u00f3g, known professionally as Walery Ltd., as \"Celebrity Portraits\"   by Sampson Low & Co. in the late 1880s. The business continued to 1964. In 1968, Macdonald & Co. (Publishers) Ltd. co-located with Sampson Low at St Giles House, 49-50 Poland Street, and took over when Sampson Low finally ceased publishing in 1969."]}]}}
