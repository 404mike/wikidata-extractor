The impact was immediate, as Watford secured promotion to the Southern League First Division in 1903\u201304. Goodall retired as a player in 1907, and left the club in 1910. He was replaced by his former captain, Harry Kent, who become known for his financial management of the club; under Kent, Watford frequently made a profit in the transfer market.Phillips 1991, pp. 38\u201341. Kent led the club to the Southern League title in 1914\u201315, and missed out on a second title in 1919\u201320 on goal average, before resigning in 1926. His three immediate successors \u2013 Fred Pagnam, Neil McBain and Bill Findlay \u2013 all played for Watford before and during the early part of their managerial tenures. None were able to lead the team to promotion from the Third Division South, although Findlay did lead Watford to a Third Division South Cup win in 1937."]}]}}
