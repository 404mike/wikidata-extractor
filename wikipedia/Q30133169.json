Johns was an assistant to Harry Cawsey at Ashford Manor before moving to Southdown Golf Club near Shoreham-by-Sea in 1907. Johns was runner-up in the 1908 Sussex Professional Tournament, losing to Jack Rowe 5&3 in the final.Johns first came to prominence in the 1909 Open Championship. He led after the first morning with a 72 and was second at the end of the day. Despite a poor third round he finished fourth, a shot behind the runners-up. His 72 remained the lowest round of the Championship. Within weeks of the Open he became the professional at Ashford Manor, replacing Harry Cawsey who was moving to a new position in Skegness. Johns completed a good season by qualifying for the final stage of the 1909 News of the World Match Play, reaching the quarter-finals. He won \u00a310, the same as he earned by finishing fourth in The Open. He had less success in the period until the start of World War I, although he reached the final of the Southern Professional Foursomes Tournament in 1911.In April 1915 became the professional at Purley Downs near Croydon, replacing James Kinnell. This was perhaps a temporary appointment as he was re-appointed in April 1919, after serving during World War I. Kinnell was killed during the war. Johns remained at Purley Downs until shortly before his death.\nJohns had a return to form in the 1920s. He finished in the top 20 of the Open on four occasions and also reached the semi-final of the 1922 News of the World Match Play, losing to George Gadd at the 19th hole. In 1925 he won his only important event, the Daily Mail Tournament, winning \u00a3300 and a gold medal. Johns had only qualified for the event through two playoffs. After the Southern section qualifying round he was one of 15 players scoring 79 who had a 9-hole playoff for one remaining place in the main event. Johns and James Ockenden tied with the best score and then played another 9-hole playoff the following day.Johns had a younger brother, Jack (1891-1918), who was also a professional golfer. Jack was also at Ashford Manor and then at Southdown from 1913. He was killed in Belgium in August 1918.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British PGA Matchplay Championship", "response": ["| 1922 || George Gadd ||  || Sunningdale Golf Club || align=center|5 & 4 ||  Fred Leach || align=center|200 || || Ernest Whitcombe, Charles Johns"]}, {"page": "Charles Johns", "response": ["Charles Johns may refer to:", "*Charles Johns (golfer) (1887\u20131947), English golfer"]}, {"page": "1909 Open Championship", "response": ["Charles Johns opened at 72 and led after the first round on Thursday morning, with J.
