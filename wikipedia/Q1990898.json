In their first season as a Football League club, Palace lost their opening game at Merthyr Town 1\u20132 with A.G. Milligan scoring the club's first ever league goal. Milligan's Palace career was short-lived however, and he made just one more appearance for the club. Palace's first ever home Football League match was a disappointing 0\u20130 draw against Plymouth Argyle, but the club then went on a run of six consecutive wins. Goalkeeper Jack Alderson, who had been signed in 1919, kept a clean sheet in all of those wins and Palace lost just six more games all season. They were unbeaten in the final sixteen games of the season which included an eight-game winning streak and went on to win the championship by five points from Southampton and gain promotion to the Second Division. The club conceded just thirty four goals over the season, a record that stood until the 1978\u201379 season,Matthews, p.26, 28 and Palace joined Preston North End, Small Heath, Liverpool and Bury as the only clubs to have won a championship in their first season as a league club.
