The film stars Niamh Cusack as Chloe, a divorced schoolteacher who falls in love with educational psychologist Dan (Douglas Henshall), only to be left heartbroken when the police arrest Dan on suspicion of sexually abusing a six-year-old that he has been assessing. Chloe is forced to confront the possibility that Dan may have also sexually abused her two daughters, Alice (Ophelia Lovibond) and Lucy (Maisie Preston).", "Additional cast members for the film include Keith Allen, who plays Chloe's ex-husband Adam, and Marian McLoughlin and Mark Bonnar, who play the officers investigating Dan, DS Vicky Griggs and DC Colin Morris. The film was broadcast in Finland in July 2004, and in Brazil under the title Verdade Sob Suspeita. Margaret Leroy praised Matthew Hall's adaptation, writing; \"I was delighted when Granada bought the television rights to Trust. During filming I spent a day on set. It was fascinating to see how my story had grown from a tiny seed of an idea into this project involving so many people - and it was quite a thrill to walk round the set and see the rooms of Chloe's house exactly as I'd imagined them.\" The film attracted an audience of 7.41 million viewers in the 9:00pm slot. Notably, the film has never been repeated, nor released on DVD."]}]}}
