In the following match, Johnson scored twice in an 8\u20130 \"thrashing\" of Northampton Town, with Arthur Dominy also scoring twice and Bill Rawlings scoring four. This remains Southampton's highest margin of victory in a Football League match. Despite this early success, Johnson was unable to maintain any consistent form, and after nine matches he lost his place back to Andrews. He was recalled to the team in March, following the sale of Fred Foxall to Birmingham as part of a four-player exchange deal, but after two matches he was dropped in favour of Ken Boyes. After a run of four matches without a victory, manager Jimmy McIntyre recalled Johnson for the match against Aberdare Athletic with Johnson scoring the only goal. The team went on to win five of the last seven matches, enabling the Saints to take the Third Division South on goal average over Plymouth Argyle."]}, {"page": "Boyes", "response": ["* Ken Boyes (footballer, born 1895) (1895\u20131963), English professional footballer", "* Ken Boyes (footballer, born 1935) (1935\u20132010), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Ken Boyes, footballer, was born in Southampton"]}, {"page": "Ken Boyes", "response": ["Ken Boyes may refer to:", "*Ken Boyes (footballer, born 1895) (1895\u20131963), English professional footballer", "*Ken Boyes (footballer, born 1935) (1935\u20132010), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Ken Boyes (footballer born 1895)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ken Boyes (footballer, born 1895)"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Ken Boyes"]}, {"page": "1921\u201322 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Ken Boyes"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["At the end of the 1921\u201322 season, several players left Southampton.

Len Butt left around the same time, joining local Southern League club Boscombe. Centre-forward John Horton, who had managed just one appearance in his first season with the Saints before breaking his leg, was forced to retire from professional football. Prior to the start of the 1922\u201323 campaign, Southampton manager Jimmy McIntyre brought in two new signings to the club.
