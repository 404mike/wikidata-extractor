In his next match, immediately afterwards, he took 5 for 64 and 4 for 89 (match figures of 37.4\u20137\u2013153\u20139) to lead Cambridge to a nine-wicket victory over Yorkshire. Later in 1910 he played two matches for Hampshire in the County Championship, taking 5 for 94 in Lancashire's first innings in the second match. He lost form in 1911.\nWith the onset of the First World War Cowie was commissioned in the British Army. He became a captain in the Seaforth Highlanders. He was wounded in 1915, but returned to active duty. He died on 7 April 1916 after being fatally wounded while serving in Mesopotamia. A short poem of his, titled \"Lines by Captain Alexander Gordon Cowie, Seaforth Highlanders\", appeared after his death in The Lotus Magazine and has since been anthologized in books of war poetry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Alexander Cowie (1889\u20131916), English cricketer who played 14 first-class matches"]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Alexander Cowie"]}, {"page": "Henry Kirby", "response": ["Kirby made a single first-class appearance for Sussex against Cambridge at Fenner's in 1911.
