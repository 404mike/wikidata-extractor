An inauspicious start saw the hosts trail 18-6 after the game's first quarter, Matty Fleming's close range riposte the only score to counter a quick fire three try salvo from the visitors but four point doubles from Rhys Williams and the irrepressible Eddie Battye were added too by tries for Kieran Dixon, Matty Fozard on his London Broncos Super League debut and Elliot Kear as the southern based outfit earnt a memorable (42-24) come from behind victory.", "The visitors, fresh from a stunning Good Friday victory at Grand Final aspirants, Warrington Wolves on their last road trip repeated the trick at the Ealing Trailfinders Sports Ground, as they ran in four unanswered tries in a one-sided first half. The Broncos hinted at a comeback in the second forty, scoring first and last, through leading try-scorer Rhys Williams and Matty Fleming, but the damage had long been irreparable as the Broncos were downed (10-30) to remain bottom of the Super League table ahead a trip to champions, Wigan Warriors in front of the Sky Sports cameras on the first Thursday in May.", "London Broncos were back in front of the Sky Sports TV cameras the following Thursday as they travelled north to the KCOM Stadium, home of third in the table, Hull F.C.. Injuries were beginning to take their toll on Danny Ward's team, and a much changed line-up saw Kieran Dixon revert to full back in place of Alex Walker, whilst other notable absentees included Ryan Morgan, Morgan Smith, Greg Richards, Nathan Mason and \u00c9loi P\u00e9lissier. The changes seemingly had an adverse effect on the capital side in a one-sided first half and London Broncos were staring down the barrel of a heavy defeat as they headed into the sheds at the break on the wrong end of a (0-34) score line. However, a stirring second half performance not only kept their hosts try less, but four point scores from Matty Fleming, Jordan Abdull against his former club, and a late double from Sadiq Adebiyi ensured respectability despite another loss (22-35).", "London Broncos were to take full advantage of the opportunity to register an unlikely home double over the runaway league leaders, and a stellar five try display swept them to their biggest victory of the season; a brace from former Saint, Matty Fleming and efforts from Luke Yates, Alex Walker and Matty Gee enough to see the hosts record a well-deserved (32-12) win over a youthful and determined St. Helens.", "The ensuing break for the Challenge Cup semi-finals (won by St. Helens and Warrington Wolves) had seen Head Coach,  Danny Ward strengthen his squad for the final six matches of the campaign with the recruitment of highly rated former NRL rookie,  Brock Lamb. The  Australian's debut was not to be one to remember though as the Broncos succumbed to a heavy (28-58) defeat, 36 of those points yielded prior to half time to an impressive Red Devils outfit which effectively ended the game as a contest, the home side's only riposte, a length of the field interception try from Rhys Williams, the Welshman's 13th of the season. To their credit, the Londoners battled gamely in the second half and were rewarded with three further four point scores through Matty Fleming, Sadiq Adebiyi and Rob Butler, but the weekend was to end with London Broncos two points adrift of the field following Hull KR's dramatic (27-26) golden point victory over Castleford Tigers and Leeds Rhinos (44-0) away success at Huddersfield Giants.", "*Matty Fleming's first points for London Broncos came when crossing the whitewash for the club's opening try of the 2019 season, in the (42-24) Round 1 home victory over Wakefield Trinity.", "|align=center| Matty Fleming", "|align=center| Matty Fleming", "|align=center| Matty Fleming"]}]}}
