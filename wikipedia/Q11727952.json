Morbey (born 9 August 1939) is a former British and Bermudian long jumper, triple jumper and sprinter. He competed for Great Britain in the long jump at the 1964 Summer Olympics, finished eleventh. Representing Bermuda, he won a silver medal in the long jump at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Morbey also placed fifteenth in the triple jump and was eliminated in the heats of the 110 yards and 4 x 110 yards relay.\nMorbey was the Bermudian team manager at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, when the Bermudian authorities decided to join the boycott of the Games. The Bermudian team was a particularly late withdrawal as its athletes appeared in the opening ceremony and in the opening day of competition before the Bermuda Olympic Association decided to formally withdraw.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Athletics at the 1964 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump", "response": ["| 7 ||align=left| John Morbey ||align=left|  ||data-sort-value=1.00| X ||data-sort-value=1.00| X || 7.56 || 7.56 || ", "| 11 ||align=left| John Morbey ||align=left|  || 7.09 || 6.91 || 6.77 ||colspan=3 data-sort-value=0.00| Did not advance || 7.09"]}, {"page": "1962 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's long jump", "response": ["| 17 || align=left | John Morbey || align=left |  || 7.12 || "]}, {"page": "Morbey, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Morbey"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 110 yards relay", "response": ["| 5 || 1 ||align=left|  || align=left|Colin Davey, Ewert Brown, John Morbey, Noel Simons || 42.6 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's triple jump", "response": ["| 15 ||align=left| John Morbey ||align=left|  ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's long jump", "response": ["|  ||align=left| John Morbey ||align=left|  ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 100 yards", "response": ["| 4 || 1 ||align=left| John Morbey ||align=left|  || 10.3 || Q", "| 6 || 4 ||align=left| John Morbey ||align=left|  || 10.0 ||"]}]}}
