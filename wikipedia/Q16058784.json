After studying law at Oxford University, he secured a regular place in the Glamorgan team. Over the next decade he made 70 Minor Counties Championship appearances for the county, as well as securing the captaincy in 1908 after succeeding Joseph Brain, while the following year he became the county secretary. He hit career best 188 against Carmarthenshire in 1908, with further consistent performances earning him a call up to the West of England for their match against the East of England, a match which saw him make his first-class debut. His performances also earnt him a call up to the Marylebone Cricket Club squad to tour the West Indies in 1910/11. He made eleven first-class appearances on the tour against Barbados, British Guiana, Trinidad, Jamaica and the West Indies themselves. The tour was fairly successful for Whittington, with him scoring 678 runs at an average of 37.66 and a high score of 154. He made two centuries and two fifties on the tour. In 1912 he was selected to play a first-class match each for South Wales and the Minor Counties, both against the touring South Africans. He later toured the West Indies again with the MCC in 1912/1913, making six first-class appearances on the tour, in the process scoring 252 runs with three half centuries, and a high score of 62. In the 1913 English season, Whittington played two first-class matches for the MCC, one each against Kent and Hampshire."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Joseph Brain (1883\u20131889) : J.
