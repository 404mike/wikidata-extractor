He writes primarily for the crime and detective genres, having contributed episodes of series such as The Avengers, The Saint, The Sweeney, Armchair Mystery Theatre, and Target.  He has helped to create several programmes of the genre, including Adam Adamant Lives!, Man in a Suitcase, and Shoestring.    Despite a career that has been largely spent writing for the crime and detective genre, in 1994 he won the prize for best situation comedy from the  Writers' Guild of Great Britain for Outside Edge, a programme he had originated as a stage play.  Though the majority of his work has been for television, a substantial amount of his output has been for the stage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adam Adamant Lives!", "response": ["Adam Adamant Lives! has been called by modern observers \"what Doctor Who did next\",https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/adamant/intro.shtml BBC Cult's introduction to the show. because at least three Doctor Who alumni had key positions on the pilot. Most obviously, it reunited producer Verity Lambert with Head of Television Drama Sydney Newman. Together they had been at the core of decision-makers who launched Doctor Who. But the series also brought Donald Cotton, who had the same year written two serials for Doctor Who, back into Newman's orbit. Cotton and partner Richard Harris would write the first script, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\", and would thus come to be credited as co-creators.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0505194/fullcredits IMDB's crew sheet for the series' pilot.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/517661/index.html The British Film Institute's page on Adam Adamant Lives!.

In truth, he is probably more correctly seen as the executive producer or as having \"developed the series for television\". Adam Adamant Lives! was a quick replacement for the show he had actually intended, an adaptation of the adventures of literary detective Sexton Blake. When the rights to the character suddenly became unavailable, it fell to writers Donald Cotton and Richard Harris, along with script editor Tony Williamson, to come up with a replacement idea.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/522017/index.html BFI article on Sydney Newman. Newman indicated near the end of his life that he had, indeed, been significantly involved in the rewrites, suggesting that his critic Mary Whitehouse had been partial inspiration for the character. Like Doctor Who which had preceded it, Adam Adamant Lives! was thus a show created somewhat by committee and circumstance.
