It can include information seeking and information retrieval, but it also aims to understand why people seek information and how they use it. The term 'information behavior' was coined by Thomas D. Wilson in 1981 and sparked controversy upon its introduction.JESSE, discussion list http://listserv.utk.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9912&L=JESSE&D=0&P=3346 The term has now been adopted and Wilson's model of information behavior is widely cited in information behavior literature. In 2000, Wilson defined information behavior as \"the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information\".", "The term was coined by Thomas D. Wilson in his 1981 paper, on the grounds that the current term, 'information needs' was unhelpful since 'need' could not be directly observed, while how people behaved in seeking information could be observed and investigated. However, there is increasing work in the information-searching field that is relating behaviors to underlying needs.BJ Jansen, D Booth, B Smith (2009) Using the taxonomy of cognitive learning to model online searching. Information Processing & Management. 45 (6), 643-663. In 2000, Wilson described information behavior as the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information-seeking, and information use. He described information-seeking behavior as purposive seeking of information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal.  Information-seeking behavior is the micro-level of behavior employed by the searcher in interacting with information systems of all kinds, be it between the seeker and the system, or the pure method of creating and following up on a search."]}, {"page": "Thomas Daniel Wilson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas D.

It was privately published by Professor Wilson until 2017, when ownership of the journal was transferred to the Swedish School of Library and Information Science, University of Bor\u00e5s.  Professor Wilson continues to act as editor-in-chief. The journal is supported by the University of Lund, which provides server space and technical assistance, and by the University of Bor\u00e5s, which provides administrative support for the deputy editor. The journal is produced entirely through voluntary work; there are no subscription or author charges.
