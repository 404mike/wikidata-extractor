Morrison remonstrated angrily before leaving the pitch, pushing Collymore in the face as he left. Collymore mentioned the incident in his autobiography, stating that Morrison 'stuck his tongue in my mouth' and that he was one of three players (along with Andy Todd and Darren Purse) who sought to 'prove that they were real hard men when they were up against me'. City's first victory of the season came in 6\u20130 defeat of Sheffield United. Morrison's performances endeared him to then Scotland manager Craig Brown. Brown was reportedly interested in calling Morrison up to the international team to play in the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-offs against England. However, twelve games into the season, Morrison picked up an injury, in a 2\u20131 victory against Port Vale. As a result, Morrison was not available to be picked by Brown for Scotland and he missed the rest of the 1999\u20132000 season. The season ended with City being promoted to the Premier League (a rare second successive promotion).

Palace signed Morrison, on loan, as a replacement for Andy Linighan, who was sacked following a dispute with Palace Chairman Simon Jordan. At Crystal Palace, Morrison played alongside both Neil Ruddock and Steve Staunton in defence. Morrison made his debut for Palace in a 2\u20131 defeat to Birmingham City. In Morrison's second game for Palace, despite defending 'in a ruggedly efficient manner', they lost 3\u20131 to Fulham (with Louis Saha scoring once and Lee Clark scoring a brace for Fulham). Morrison subsequently played in a 3\u20132 defeat to Portsmouth and a 1\u20130 defeat to Grimsby Town After the defeat to Grimsby, Morrison farted during a team talk by Smith, enraging Simon Jordan.
