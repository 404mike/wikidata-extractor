He was born in London, and studied at the University of Hull and University of London.  After working as a jazz musician, he spent 1982\u201383 on a bursary working with Scottish Opera and the Citizens Theatre.\nHis work has become controversial and has provoked considerable reactions from the UK press.  However, he is also seen as a major figure in the worlds of theatre and opera, as has been noted in a 2002 interview which appeared in London's The Guardian:\n\n[His] gift for the thrilling, the gaudy and the wayward is one of the characteristics that marks Jones out. \"He is the best British director around at the moment,\" says director David Pountney, part of the \"powerhouse\" triumvirate that presided over English National Opera in the 1980s. \"He is extremely imaginative, he has a very individual, quirky response to the material, and a very sharp eye for humour.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Into the Woods", "response": ["The original West End production opened on September 25, 1990 at the Phoenix Theatre and closed on February 23, 1991 after 197 performances. It was directed by Richard Jones, and produced by David Mirvish, with set design by Richard Hudson, choreography by Anthony Van Laast, costumes by Sue Blane and orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. The cast featured Julia McKenzie as the Witch, Ian Bartholomew as the Baker, Imelda Staunton as the Baker's Wife and Clive Carter as the Wolf/Cinderella's Prince. The show received seven Olivier Award nominations in 1991, winning for Best Actress in a Musical (Staunton) and Best Director of a Musical (Jones).", "The song \"Our Little World\" was added.\"1990 London Production\"  SondheimGuide.com, accessed March 26, 2011 This song was a duet sung between the Witch and Rapunzel giving further insight into the care the Witch has for her self-proclaimed daughter and the desire Rapunzel has to see the world outside of her tower. The overall feel of the show was a lot darker than that of the original Broadway production. Critic Michael Billington wrote, \"But the evening's triumph belongs also to director Richard Jones, set designer Richard Hudson and costume designer Sue Blane who evoke exactly the right mood of haunted theatricality. Old-fashioned footlights give the faces a sinister glow. The woods themselves are a semi-circular, black-and-silver screen punctuated with nine doors and a crazy clock: they achieve exactly the 'agreeable terror' of Gustave Dore's children's illustrations. And the effects are terrific: doors open to reveal the rotating magnified eyeball or the admonitory finger of the predatory giant.\"\"Arts: In the thickets of thought \u2013 Michael Billington sings the praises of Sondheim and Lapine's fairy tale attempt to push the musical into new and daring directions\", The Guardian (London), September 27, 1990 (no page number)", "| Richard Jones"]}, {"page": "The Twilight Zone", "response": ["In December 2017 the Almeida Theatre in London are staging the World Premiere production of 'The Twilight Zone'.
