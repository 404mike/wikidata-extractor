He was born in Nelson and played for the Nelson under 18s winning the U-18s League 2. However, he was not satisfied with Nelson and signed for Accrington Stanley. He made his first team debut in a 1\u20130 loss to Northampton Town and only made 3 appearances in a year. He then moved to non-league side Barnoldswick Town and instantly became a red hot favourite with the fans, netting 5 in his first five appearances but an injury ruled him out. He only played until the next season, when he netted a hattrick that replenished Barnoldswick's survival hopes in that league. They did stay in the division but Whalley decided to retire. However, he did become head coach at Brierfield Central and guided them to a third successive title a well as the Morrison Cup. He died, aged 73, at his home in Burnley.", "link_mentions": []}}
