(1903\u20131965)", "response": ["For the next few seasons, they lay in mid-table, while the management committee relied on player sales to English clubs to bankroll the club. But, with an improving squad, came a succession of near misses. The Shield remained elusive \u2013 they finished as runners-up to Drumcondra by a point in 1946\u201347, when the latter equalised with minutes remaining in their final match (against Waterford) to secure the point they needed. Then, in 1947\u201348, they just missed out in both the League and the Dublin City Cup by a point. So the committee decided to invest its surplus from transfer dealings that season on a player-coach (Ned Weir), and a number of full-time players, in an ambitious attempt to win the trophies that had been beyond reach. The investment immediately paid off when the City Cup was won at the start of the new season by topping its league format unbeaten; while the club's second FAI Cup was delivered with victory over Shelbourne in the final. But the new team fell short in both the Shield and the League, and, despite the Cup double and improved gate receipts, the additional income was not enough to cover the increase in costs.", "Dundalk had finished as runners-up in the League in 1947\u201348, unbeaten at home, and with a healthy surplus from improved gates, friendlies against Everton and Luton Town, and transfer dealings. This allowed the management-committee to make some much-needed improvements to Oriel Park that summer. However the appointment of Ned Weir (signed from Raith Rovers) as the team's new head coach, a Scottish physio (Hugh O'Donnell), and the signing of six Scottish full-time players, represented a gamble by the club. As things stood, gate-receipts did not match wages, and player transfers to England in the years following World War II were keeping it afloat. So the investment was an ambitious attempt to bring the club to a new level of competitiveness and success, and the hope was that gate-receipts would follow. The City Cup was won at the start of the new season by topping its League format unbeaten; while in the League and Shield they were competitive without really threatening to win either competition - finishing third in both. But the club's fourth FAI Cup was delivered with victory over champions-elect Drumcondra in the semi-final, and Shelbourne in the final. They reached the final of the last Dublin and Belfast Inter-City Cup, where a tired side, which had played eight matches in three weeks, was defeated in the final. Despite two cups, the gamble hadn't paid off. Between 1946\u201347 and 1948\u201349 income had doubled, but wages and costs had almost trebled in the same period, and the cash surplus had become a significant debt within a year. It didn't help that on the day of the cup final the players demanded a 20% increase in the win bonus, refusing to tog-out until it was agreed. As a result, the \"Scottish team\" was broken up at the end of the season, and the dream of maintaining a full-time squad was over. Only one player, Newry man Johnny Fearon, would still be at the club for its next FAI Cup success three seasons later. He would later become the team physio during the 1970s."]}]}}
