He is portrayed by Javier Bardem. A former MI6 agent, he turns to cyberterrorism and begins targeting the agency he used to work for as part of a plan to get revenge against M, against whom he holds a homicidal grudge.\nBardem received critical acclaim for his performance, and Silva is regularly ranked among the greatest villains in the Bond film series.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Q (James Bond)", "response": ["The character of Q did not appear in 2006's Casino Royale or its sequel, Quantum of Solace (2008). Bond actor Daniel Craig expressed concern over the character's absence, and expressed his hope that Q would return in Skyfall. In November 2011, it was announced that British actor Ben Whishaw had been cast in the role. Bond first meets Q in front of a painting at the National Gallery in London, where he at first expresses disbelief at the relative youth of his new quartermaster, but the two quickly earn each other's respect. In Skyfall, Q's gadgets were comparatively simple, consisting of a miniaturized radio and a gun coded to Bond's palmprint so only Bond could fire it. When Bond appears a little disappointed, Q comments 'Were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go in for that anymore,' in reference to a miniature grenade featured in GoldenEye. Q is demonstrated to be highly knowledgeable on the subject of computer security to the point where he designed some of the most sophisticated security protocols in existence. However, he is also somewhat short-sighted; while engrossed in the puzzle of a security system found on a laptop set up by Raoul Silva, the film's main antagonist, Q is unaware that he is inadvertently facilitating Silva's escape from MI6 custody as Silva's laptop hacks the MI6 computer network. After a hacking warning appears on his wall monitor, all the doors in the facility opens including the containment cell holding Silva, Q angrily yells to his techs to ask him how he got into their system. A message then appears on the laptop taunting Q, he unplugs it but he's too late and it quickly dawns on him that it was his actions that led to the hacking and Silva's subsequent escape. As with Desmond Llewelyn's Q, he also gets frustrated with Bond's knack for damaging or destroying the gadgets \u2013 at the end of Skyfall the Aston Martin DB5 is burned out in the final showdown with Silva."]}, {"page": "SPECTRE", "response": ["The organisation returns in the rebooted Daniel Craig series of Bond films, which are set in an entirely separate universe to the earlier movies. In the 2015 film Spectre, the eponymous committee is simply referred to by that title. In the film, Bond is posthumously sent by Judi Dench's M to assassinate Marco Sciarra, which in turn leads him on the trail of the organisation. It is revealed throughout the course of the film that Spectre, and in turn Ernst Stavro Blofeld, have been the power behind the previous Craig villains; the Quantum organisation from Casino Royale and  2008's Quantum of Solace is revealed to be a subsidiary of Spectre, while Raoul Silva from Skyfall is shown to be affiliated with the organisation.

Bond ultimately foils Blofeld's plans and has the opportunity to kill him, but instead decides to spare his life and M (Ralph Fiennes) takes Blofeld into custody. This incarnation again wears a jacket without lapels and has a full head of hair, and in this incarnation we see his disfiguration through the use of an explosive watch created by Q, which echoes the scar and blind eye of Donald Pleasence's version.

It was originally reported that MGM was keen to set up a film series that would be a \"winter olympics\" alternative to the main series. In the late 1990s, MGM had originally considered developing a spin-off film based on Michelle Yeoh's character, Wai Lin, in 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies. The spinoff Jinx was announced in December 2002. Lee Tamahori initially wanted to direct, but Stephen Frears was ultimately hired. Berry and Michael Madsen were originally going to reprise their roles as Jinx and Falco, while Jinx's lover was going to be played by Javier Bardem. Bardem would later play  villain Raoul Silva in Skyfall (2012). The film would have revolved around Jinx's entry into the NSA, revealing that she had been adopted by Falco after being orphaned in a bombing and being hired by him from the RAND Corporation to do a job at the NSA as a favor. Wade described the film as \"a very atmospheric, Euro thriller, a Bourne-type movie.\" However, despite much speculation of an imminent movie, on 26 October 2003, Variety reported that MGM had cancelled the project.. Retrieved 28 March 2008 MGM instead decided to reboot the James Bond franchise with the next film, Casino Royale, with Daniel Craig portraying the role of the titular character. In 2020 Berry revealed that the film was cancelled over its $80 million budget, saying \"Nobody was ready to sink that kind of money into a black female action star.\" Purvis and Wade said that this decision was influenced by the failure of several action films with female stars, including Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life, in 2003."]}, {"page": "Javier Bardem", "response": ["In 2010, he was awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival for his performance in Biutiful directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, who specifically wrote the film with Bardem in mind.

He won his 5th Goya Award, this time for Best Actor in Biutiful, dedicating the win to his wife, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, and newborn son. Around this same time he was offered the lead role of \"Gunslinger\" Roland Deschain in Ron Howard's adaptation of Stephen King's Dark Tower novels. If he had signed, he would have starred in the TV series as well. Then Eon Productions offered him a role as villain Raoul Silva in the James Bond film Skyfall.. .

It ends in disaster when she is ordered to shoot through Bond while he is fighting hand-to-hand combat with the mercenary they are chasing. She hits Bond, who falls off a bridge and is assumed dead. She is temporarily suspended for this and reassigned to desk duty, assisting Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, who has been assigned to watch over MI6.

In this new continuity, M has worked for MI6 for some time, at one point muttering, \"Christ, I miss the Cold War\". According to Skyfall, M was previously in charge of MI6's operations in Hong Kong during the 1990s. Her ability to run MI6 has been questioned more than once; in Casino Royale, she is the subject of a review when Bond is caught shooting an unarmed prisoner and blowing up a foreign embassy on camera; in Quantum of Solace, the Foreign Secretary orders her to personally withdraw Bond from the field in Bolivia and to stop any investigations into Dominic Greene's eco-terrorist organisation; and in Skyfall, she is the subject of a public inquiry when MI6 loses a computer hard drive containing the identities of undercover agents around the world. Skyfall marked Dench's seventh appearance as M, where she is targeted by former MI6 agent Raoul Silva, whom she turned over to the Chinese in order to save six other agents. She assists Bond with making booby traps in preparation of Silva's forces coming to attack at Bond's old family estate, Skyfall in Scotland. She is shot and wounded before dying from her wounds in the film, making her the only M to die in the Eon Bond films.
