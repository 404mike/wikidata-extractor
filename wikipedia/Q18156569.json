He was born in 1873 at Cumberland and died sometime around 1919. Goodchild was employed to supply artwork for a fully illustrated and multi-volume work, Birds of Australia. by Gregory Mathews. This followed the death of John Keulemans in 1912. His works appeared in several other publications, but Goodchild's talents were regarded as overlooked (Olsen, 2015) in the field of ornithological illustration.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Birds of Australia (Mathews)", "response": ["As well as the extensive scientific text, in which Mathews described several new species and subspecies, the 12 volumes are illustrated with some 600 hand-coloured lithographed plates by J.G. Keulemans (who completed 163 illustrations for the first four volumes before his death on 29 March 1912), H. Gr\u00f6nvold, Roland Green, Herbert Goodchild and G.E. Lodge.  Stone commented on the plates by saying that as artistic productions they could not be compared with the great folios of John Gould, though those by Keulemans were probably the best."]}]}}
