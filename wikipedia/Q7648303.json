The surprising impact that romantic novels have on our work\" in the Journal of Family Planning & Reproductive Health Care published by the BMJ Group. In the paper, Quilliam writes \"what we see in our [family planning clinic] consulting rooms is more likely to be informed by Mills & Boon than by the Family Planning Association.\" Quilliam argues that a correlation exists between negative attitudes toward the use of condoms and reading of romantic fiction; as well as citing a survey that shows only 11.5 per cent of romantic novels mention condom use. She suggests that a romance reader may \"not [use] protection with a new man because she wants to be swept up by the moment as a heroine would.\" Among other potential problems, romantic fiction readers are also likely to have unrealistic expectations about sex, to equate lack of romance or sexual desire with a lack of love, to see pregnancy as a cure of relationship difficulties and to be less likely to terminate pregnancies. Relationships of romance readers are more likely to break down because they are likely to think that \"rather than working at her relationship she should be hitching her star to a new romance.\" Quilliam also writes that \"a deep strand of escapism, perfectionism and idealisation runs through the genre\" and \"if readers start to believe the story that romantic fiction offers, then they store up trouble for themselves\u2013and then they bring that trouble into our consulting rooms.\""]}, {"page": "Quilliam", "response": ["*Susan Quilliam (born 1950), an agony aunt and author noted for bringing systemic psychology to a mass audience"]}, {"page": "Laura Bates", "response": ["Bates was born on 27 August 1986 in Oxford to Diane Elizabeth Bates, a French teacher, and Adrian Keith Bates, a physician.
