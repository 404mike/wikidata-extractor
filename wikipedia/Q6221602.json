He played bass for the band Squeeze from 1980 to 1982, appearing on the albums Argybargy and East Side Story, as well as Sweets from a Stranger. Squeeze initially split up in 1982, and upon reforming in 1985, band leaders Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook replaced Bentley with Keith Wilkinson.\nBentley re-joined Squeeze for the band's 2007 reformation, playing on the band's \"Quintessential Tour 2007\" through the US and UK; although he left the band following two British festival appearances in 2015. Tillbrook reflected on Bentley's role in the band:\n\nI certainly underrated what John brought to the band the first time around. The Squeeze sound did change when we had Keith Wilkinson, and looking back now, not necessarily for the better. I think John drives us a lot.\nBentley's solo album was released on vinyl and iTunes in 2014.\nIn 2018, Bentley's band The Buzniks released their self-titled first album through 3Ms music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Squeeze (band)", "response": ["The band's second album, Cool for Cats (1979), contained the band's two highest charting UK singles in \"Cool For Cats\" and \"Up The Junction\", both of which peaked at No.\u00a02.

Jools Holland and Gilson Lavis were unable to take part in the series of shows, as they were touring under the \"Jools Holland & His Rhythm & Blues Orchestra\" name for most of the year. However, John Bentley re-joined on bass for the first time since Squeeze's last reunion show in 1985. The rest of the line-up was fleshed out by members of Tilbrook's touring band, the Fluffers: Stephen Large (keyboards) and Simon Hanson (drums).", "Beginning in the autumn of 2014, Difford and Tilbrook began touring as a duo, playing Squeeze hits in smaller venues in the UK. Squeeze, still operating as a full band, also continued to play occasional festival shows through 2014 and 2015.  In early 2015, Squeeze announced that bassist John Bentley would play his final gig with the band on 24 July. In an interview, Bentley announced his replacement will be Lucy Shaw (also the bassist for Tilbrook's backing band The Fluffers), which was officially confirmed by Squeeze in August."]}, {"page": "East Side Story (Squeeze album)", "response": ["*John Bentley \u2013 bass, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Sweets from a Stranger", "response": ["Within a year after the release of this album, Squeeze broke up.

Written by Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, it was released on the album Argybargy.

Bentley recalled, \"I turned to Glenn and I said, 'That riff would sound really good if you overdubbed a marimba.' ... He just kinda looked at me and didn't say anything, ...so I didn't think any more about it. The next day, we came into the studio and I walked in and there was a classical set of marimbas!\" Tilbrook claimed the song would have been \"very ordinary\" without the band's assistance."]}]}}
