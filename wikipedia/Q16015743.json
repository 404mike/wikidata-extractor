He took an early retirement and moved to Australia.\nBennett was born in Wales, served with the British signals intelligence organization GCHQ during World War II. According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations, Bennett met Kim Philby during World War II, when they were both stationed in Turkey.\nWhile living in Australia in 1950 Bennett married an Australian woman. Later that year he and his wife moved to Canada when he began his 22-year employment as a civilian employee of the RCMP\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations in 1962 the Central Intelligence Agency's chief of counter-intelligence James Jesus Angleton trusted Bennett to interview a key Soviet defector Anatol Golitsyn. However, Angleton, who was known for being highly suspicious, began to suspect that Bennett might himself be a mole.  Angleton opened a dossier on Bennett in 1967.  By 1970 Angleton's suspicions grew to the point the RCMP had to conduct an investigation into Bennett.  They put him under surveillance, tapped his phone, and bugged his house\u2014including his bedroom.  This operation, codenamed \"Operation Gridiron\" culminated in taking Bennett to a safehouse for a humiliating five-day interrogation.  During his interrogation his interrogators asked Bennett embarrassing personal questions about his sex life based on comments captured from the bug in his bedroom.  The investigation did not find any evidence that Bennett was a double agent, but his clearance to have access to top secret information was withdrawn, to satisfy American concerns.  According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations, when Angleton was removed in 1974, it turned out he never had any real evidence Bennett had ever been disloyal.\nAfter he left the RCMP his wife left him, and returned to Australia with their two daughters.\nThe Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations asserted that he was only able to get menial work.\nIn 1977 Ian Adams published a short novel entitled S: Portrait of a Spy, about a senior RCMP security official who was a mole.\nOther commentators would assert that many of the novel's character seemed to be thinly veiled descriptions of real individuals\u2014starting with \"S\", the titular character, who Paul Hellyer and Peter Worthington would identify as Bennett.\nWorthington contacted Bennett, strongly encouraging him to sue Adams.\nDuring the civil suit the judge required Adams to name his sources, but allowed Bennett to refuse to testify on the grounds that doing so might reveal secrets that would put national security at risk. Adams and Bennett reached an out of court settlement.\n Bennett was paid $30,000\u2014reported to be barely enough to pay his legal expenses.\nIn 1982 John Sawatsky published For Services Rendered: Leslie James Bennett and the RCMP Security Service, which he presented as a more thorough, professional examination of Bennett's career.In 1985 another Soviet defector, Vitali Sergeyevich Yurchenko confirmed there was a Soviet mole in the RCMP, but identified him as another official. According to the Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations the actual mole was Sergeant Gilles G. Brunet. In 1993 The Fifth Estate, an investigative journalism television program from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, profiled Bennett, and interviewed a former KGB director of foreign counter-intelligence, General Oleg Kalugin, who also confirmed another RCMP official was the mole, and that he had never heard of Bennett.The Fifth Estate also identified the mole as Gilles G. Brunet.\nAccording to Dan Mulvenna, a colleague of Bennett, in 1993, after The Fifth Estate profiled Bennett, the then Solicitor General \"exonerated\" Bennett, and he was given a $100,000 payment.\nBennett had been a civilian employee of the RCMP, he was not officially a Mountie, but, according to Mulvenna, due to his long service and the respect felt for him, the organization of retired Mounties made him an honorary member.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Adams", "response": ["His 1977 novel, S \u2013 Portrait of a Spy, led to a libel suit in which a former RCMP Security Service officer Leslie James Bennett claimed the central character, a Soviet mole who penetrated the RCMP, was modelled after him.

The case was settled out of court with Adams paying Bennett $30,000 and agreeing to add a disclaimer to the book.

The two officers reported that Golitsyn had brought with him a collection of leads into operations that the Soviet Second Directorate had directed against the Canadian Embassy, including an operation to blackmail a gay Canadian ambassador who had been caught in a sex trap. Golitsyn could only narrow the time frame to the 1950s and was unable to identify the ambassador or whether he had been swayed or controlled by the trap. In an effort to identify the unnamed ambassador, the Canadian Security Service launched Operation Rock Bottom. Security Service officers Charles Sweeny and Leslie James Bennettconsidered to be the RCMP's counterespionage guruwanted to question Golitsyn for further details but were told they had to wait in line behind the Americans, British, French, Germans, and Dutch. While waiting for their turn, Sweeny and Bennett attempted to match up clues by scouring almost 500 files at External Affairs. In August 1962, they finally had their opportunity to question Golitsyn at a safehouse in Washington, D.C., but were unable to discover any new leads. The investigation initially focused on David Johnson, the Canadian ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1956 to 1960, who resigned his position after a previous investigation forced him to admit his homosexuality. Although Johnson had been a ambassador in the 1950s, other details from Golitsyn's leads did not match up. Additional review suggested that the unidentified ambassador could be Watkins, but the investigation stalled with no firm evidence against either him or Johnson."]}, {"page": "List of controversies involving the Royal Canadian Mounted Police", "response": ["In 1972, it was suspected that there was a Soviet infiltrator in the ranks of Canadian intelligence.

Commentators on intelligence matters would point out that Josaphat's role as the founding director of Canada's spy-catching agency had eased his son Gilles's attempts to evade detection, because he was \"one of us\"."]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2003", "response": ["*Leslie James Bennett, 82/83, British/Canadian counter-intelligence officer."]}]}}
