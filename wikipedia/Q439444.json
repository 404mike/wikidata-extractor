Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. As the novel described it as an ice palace, they decided to make \"the magic ceiling out of ice\", covering the walls in reflective silver and giving \"an icy or silver makeover\" to the decorations. McMillan and fellow set decorator Lee Sandales also created \"magical ice sculptures, iced drinks and frosted food\". Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it \"one of the biggest sets we've ever built for any of the films.\" For the second task, involving the film's underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue screen tank measuring  deep by , holding \"about half a million gallons of water.\" It is the largest underwater filming tank in Europe. As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from  tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery."]}, {"page": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)", "response": ["| Stuart CraigStephenie McMillan"]}, {"page": "David Heyman", "response": ["|Shared with J.K.
