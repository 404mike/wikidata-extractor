He used a lantern to light the way in the dark arena during entrances, with entrance music by Mark Crozer. He would finish off most of his promos telling opponents and audiences to \"follow the buzzards\", his signature catchphrase.

He would use a swinging reverse STO as a finishing move that would be referred to as Sister Abigail."]}]}}
