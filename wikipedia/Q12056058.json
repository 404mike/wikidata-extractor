Dearle designed many of the later wallpapers and textiles released by Morris & Co., and contributed background and foliage patterns to tapestry designs featuring figures by Edward Burne-Jones and others. Beginning in his teens as a shop assistant and then design apprentice, Dearle rose to become Morris & Co.'s chief designer by 1890, creating designs for tapestries, embroidery, wallpapers, woven and printed textiles, stained glass, and carpets. Following Morris's death in 1896, Dearle was appointed Art Director of the firm, and became its principal stained glass designer on the death of Burne-Jones in 1898.Morris's reputation overshadowed Dearle's work throughout Dearle's career: Dearle exhibited early patterns under Morris's name and Dearle designs continue to be sold as Morris patterns. Critical assessment of Dearle's work then underwent a significant change during the final decades of the twentieth century, recognizing Dearle's mature work as having a unique artistic vision of its own. Dearle always remained close to Morris's aesthetic, but from the 1890s onward he incorporated a distinctive set of Persian and Turkish influences.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1890 in art", "response": ["** with William Morris and John Henry Dearle \u2013 The Adoration of the Magi (tapestry woven by Morris & Co. for Exeter College, Oxford)"]}, {"page": "1859 in art", "response": ["* August 22 \u2013 John Henry Dearle, English textile designer (died 1932)"]}, {"page": "Morris & Co.", "response": ["In 1879, Morris had taught himself tapestry weaving in the medieval style and set up a tapestry workshop with his apprentice John Henry Dearle at Queen Square.Parry, Linda: William Morris Textiles, New York, Viking Press, pp. 103\u2013104 Dearle executed Morris and Co.'s first figural tapestry from a design by Walter Crane in 1883.Waggoner, The Beauty of Life, p. 86.
