The convention in naval warfare of the time was that ships of the line did not attack frigates when there were ships of equal size to engage, but in firing first French Captain Claude-Jean Martin had negated the rule. Saumarez waited until the frigate was at close range before replying.Adkins, p. 26 Orion needed just one broadside to reduce the frigate to a wreck, and Martin's disabled ship drifted away over the shoal. During the delay this detour caused, two other British ships joined the battle: Theseus, which had been disguised as a first-rate ship,Warner, p. 109 followed Foley's track across Guerriers bow. Miller steered his ship through the middle of the melee between the anchored British and French ships until he encountered the third French ship, .

Davidge Gould || Audacious ||", "According to Andrew Lambert, while Nelson \"considered all had been equally valiant, he did not mean that all had been equally able, or equally significant\". Some had been competent and brave without particularly distinguishing themselves. The weakest of the brothers was held to be Davidge Gould. Though Gould had been in action before, and had not disgraced himself at the Nile or previously, Lambert considered that his \"wooden, unimaginative handling of his ship during the battle stood in stark contrast to the bold, decisive action of his fellow captains, and fell far below the standard that Nelson expected\". Darby, Peyton and Gould were not invited to join Nelson's forces again. Nelson had planned to replace Gould, selecting George Murray instead.

A large part of the consignment was loaded onto an American ship named Olive Branch in Ostend for deliver to USA.  During the voyage the Olive Branch was intercepted in the Atlantic by HMS Audacious under the command of Captain  Davidge Gould.  Discrepancies with the paperwork led to the Olive Branch being taken back to Portsmouth by the British for further investigation.  Allen, who had been a passenger on the Olive Branch, claimed that the shipment of weapons was for the sole use of the Vermont militia.  He argued that the transaction had complied with the terms of the newly signed Jay Treaty and the cargo should be released and allowed to continue to Vermont.  The British had unsatisfactory dealings with Allen and his brothers some years before (referred to as the Haldimand Affair) and now viewed him with suspicion They counter claimed that the shipment was destined for Ireland to help start a rebellion against Britain.  Allen was imprisoned in Britain, but later released on bail to allow him to travel back to France to obtain documents to corroborate his version of events. His bail of \u00a32000 was provided by Bird, Savage & Bird in exchange for the cargo of muskets. These were transported to New York and offered for sale by Robert Bird, but their condition had deteriorated, and further costs were incurred to clean the weapons before they could be marketed.  It also became evident that the valuation placed on these guns had been optimistic."]}]}}
