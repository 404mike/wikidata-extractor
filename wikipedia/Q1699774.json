According to his brother and fellow chemist John Davy, their hometown was characterised by \"an almost unbounded credulity respecting the supernatural and monstrous ... Amongst the middle and higher classes, there was little taste for literature, and still less for science ... Hunting, shooting, wrestling, cockfighting, generally ending in drunkenness, were what they most delighted in.\" At the age of six, Davy was sent to the grammar school at Penzance. Three years later, his family moved to Varfell, near Ludgvan, and subsequently, in term-time Davy boarded with John Tonkin, his godfather and later his guardian. On leaving Penzance grammar school in 1793, Tonkin paid for Davy to attend Truro Grammar School to finish his education under the Rev Dr Cardew, who, in a letter to Davies Gilbert, said dryly, \"I could not discern the faculties by which he was afterwards so much distinguished.\" Yet, Davy entertained his school friends by writing poetry, composing Valentines, and telling stories from One Thousand and One Nights. Reflecting on his school days in a letter to his mother, Davy wrote, \"Learning naturally is a true pleasure; how unfortunate then it is that in most schools it is made a pain.\" \"I consider it fortunate,\" he continued, \"I was left much to myself as a child, and put upon no particular plan of study ... What I am I made myself.\" His brother, moreover, claimed Davy possessed a \"native vigour\" and \"the genuine quality of genius, or of that power of intellect which exalts its possessor above the crowd.\""]}, {"page": "Phosgene", "response": ["Phosgene was synthesized by the Cornish chemist John Davy (1790\u20131868) in 1812 by exposing a mixture of carbon monoxide and chlorine to sunlight. He named it \"phosgene\" from Greek \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2 (phos, light) and \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03ac\u03c9 (genna\u014d, to give birth) in reference of the use of light to promote the reaction. Phosgene was named on p. 151: \" ... it will be necessary to designate it by some simple name. I venture to propose that of phosgene, or phosgene gas; from \u03c6\u03c9\u03c2, light, \u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, to produce, which signifies formed by light; ... \" It gradually became important in the chemical industry as the 19th century progressed, particularly in dye manufacturing."]}, {"page": "William Gilbert (physician)", "response": ["Besides Gilbert's De Magnete, there appeared at Amsterdam in 1651 a quarto volume of 316 pages entitled De Mundo Nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova (New Philosophy about our Sublunary World), edited\u2014some say by his brother William Gilbert Junior, and others say, by the eminent English scholar and critic John Gruter\u2014from two manuscripts found in the library of Sir William Boswell. According to Dr. John Davy, \"this work of Gilbert's, which is so little known, is a very remarkable one both in style and matter; and there is a vigor and energy of expression belonging to it very suitable to its originality. Possessed of a more minute and practical knowledge of natural philosophy than Bacon, his opposition to the philosophy of the schools was more searching and particular, and at the same time probably little less efficient.\" In the opinion of Prof. John Robison, De Mundo consists of an attempt to establish a new system of natural philosophy upon the ruins of the Aristotelian doctrine."]}, {"page": "Algor mortis", "response": ["The term was first used by Bennet Dowler in 1849.

At the North end of this Kings Dominions is one of these Ruinous Cities, called Anurodgburro, where they say Ninety Kings have Reigned, the Spirits of whom they hold now to be Saints in Glory, having merited it by making Pagoda\u2019s and Stone Pillars and Images to the honour of their Gods, whereof there are many yet remaining: which the Chingulayes count very meritorious to worship, and the next way to Heaven. Near by is a River, by which we came when we made our escape: all along which is abundance of hewed stones, some long for Pillars, some broad for paving. Over this River there have been three Stone Bridges built upon Stone Pillars, but now are fallen down; and the Countrey all desolate without Inhabitants. At this City of Anurodgburro is a Watch kept, beyond which are no more people that yield obedience to the King of Candy. This place is above Ninety miles to the Northward of the City of Candy. In these Northern Parts there are no Hills, nor but two or three Springs of running water, so that their Corn ripeneth with the help of Rain.\" In 1821, John Davy wrote that: \"Anooradapoora, so long the capital of Ceylon, is now a small mean village, in the midst of a desert.
