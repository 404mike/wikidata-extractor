In 1846 he matriculated at the University of Berlin, and passed first class at examinations in Kiel. As a result, he was allowed a stipend by the Danish Government to travel as gardener and botanist; but the war of 1848 prevented him from enjoying this privilege.Krichauff went to South Australia in December 1848, and settled at Bugle Ranges in the Adelaide Hills, east of the city of Adelaide. For many years he was the chairman of the District Council of Macclesfield, as well of the District Council of Strathalbyn. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Mount Barker on 9 March 1857, but resigned on 12 March 1858. He was again elected to the House, this time for Onkaparinga on 5 April 1870, serving until 22 May 1882, when he resigned his seat to travel in Europe and America. After his return he was elected to the Assembly for the district of Victoria (8 April 1884), and continued to represent the constituency until his retirement from the House at the 1890 colonial election.\nKrichauff briefly served as a Minister in May 1870, when he was Commissioner of Public Works for twenty days in Henry Strangways' reconstructed Cabinet. He was returned to the South Australian Legislative Council in June 1890 for the Southern District, holding the seat until 18 May 1894.Krichauff married Dora Fischer at Bugle Ranges on 10 May 1853. He died in Norwood, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia on 29 September 1904.Edward William Krichauff (1858 \u2013 22 December 1925), a trustee of the State Bank of South Australia, was a son.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein", "response": ["*Friedrich Krichauff (1824\u20131904) politician in colonial South Australia"]}, {"page": "Forty-Eighters", "response": ["*Friedrich Krichauff, chairman of the Agricultural Bureau"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1857\u20131860", "response": ["| Friedrich Krichauff resigned on 12 March 1858.

Some residents of both the Hundred of Wirrega and the Hundred of Tatiara had petitioned for their own District Councils in 1875, while others had protested against the creation of a council at all, stating that the area was \"too small and scattered\". Another local group, among them local MP Friedrich Krichauff, argued that a united District Council should be created to cover both hundreds, as they were too small to sustain their own and a larger municipality would be cheaper.
