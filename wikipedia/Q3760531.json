The visual illustration was designed by George Housman Thomas and was published in 1867 alongside the novel. Titled The Last Chronicle of Barset With Illustrations, the black and white copy features certain events from the novel. For certain illustrations, Thomas had drawn inspiration from John Everett Millais, a Victorian illustrator. Millias had provided multiple illustrations of The Crawley Family in Trollope's fourth novel in the series, Framley Parsonage. Gordon Ray states that these illustrations serve to vividly complement the novel as they provide an understanding of Trollope's intentions with each character. While Trollope did not draw the illustrations himself, Ray stated that each sketch was tailored to Trollope's own personal desire as Trollope believed that \"the author can select the subjects better than the artist - having all the feelings of the story at his fingers' end.\""]}, {"page": "1855 in poetry", "response": ["* Thomas Campbell, The Pleasures of Hope, with Other Poems (first published 1799), illustrated by Birket Foster, George Housman Thomas and Harrison Weir"]}, {"page": "Housman (surname)", "response": ["* George Housman Thomas (1824\u20131868), English painter and illustrator "]}, {"page": "N.
