She's Done It Again, opened at the Garrick to the best reviews Rix had ever enjoyed, but it had the shortest run of any of his productions to that date. Rix could never find an obvious reason for the production's short run, for the play enjoyed a sell-out tour after the Garrick. His favoured explanation was that the play, funny as it was, might have seemed somewhat old-fashioned, as it was adapted by Michael Pertwee from a pre-war farce Nap Hand by Vernon Sylvaine and based upon the birth of Dionne quintuplets."]}, {"page": "Basil Radford", "response": ["* Warn That Man! by Vernon Sylvaine (1941)"]}, {"page": "Ciar\u00e1n Hinds", "response": ["| Vernon Sylvaine"]}, {"page": "Nigel Green", "response": ["Subsequent West End appearances included Come Live With Me (directed by Roy Rich: Vaudeville Theatre, June 1951),Frances Stephens, Theatre World Annual (London) # 3 (Rockliff 1952), page 20 Heloise (directed by Michael Powell: Duke of York's Theatre, November 1951),Frances Stephens, Theatre World Annual (London) # 3 (Rockliff 1952), page 21 Vernon Sylvaine's As Long as They're Happy, opposite Jack Buchanan (directed by Roy Rich: Garrick Theatre, July 1953),Frances Stephens, Theatre World Annual (London) # 5 (Rockliff 1954), page 38 F\u00e9licien Marceau's The Egg (directed by Charles Frank: Saville Theatre, October 1957))Frances Stephens, Theatre World Annual (London) # 9 (Rockliff 1958), page 66 and Agatha Christie's Go Back for Murder (directed by Hubert Gregg: Duchess Theatre, March 1960).Frances Stephens, Theatre World Annual (London) # 11 (Barrie & Rockliff 1960), page 23"]}, {"page": "Raymond Lovell", "response": ["Lovell initially trained as a physician at Cambridge University, but gave up medicine for the stage in the 1920s.Criterion DVD commentary for 49th Parallel by Bruce Eder.
