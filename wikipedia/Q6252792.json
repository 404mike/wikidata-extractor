This view has been criticised: John Philipps Kenyon and Jane Ohlmeyer noted that the conflict was not an exclusively English affair, so cannot be considered part of the English Civil War; the historian Austin Woolrych observed that it was almost entirely a conflict between Scottish and English forces, involving very few English soldiers fighting on behalf of the king at the final battle at Worcester, so it was \"seriously misleading\" to refer to it as a civil war. Though the conflict was certainly a part of the wider Wars of the Three Kingdoms, rather than being a continuation of the English Civil War, it was by this stage a war between Scotland, ruled by the Covenanting government under Charles II, and the English Commonwealth."]}, {"page": "William Scroggs", "response": ["*John Philipps Kenyon The Popish Plot  Phoenix Press Reissue 2000"]}, {"page": "Thomas Thwing", "response": ["John Philipps Kenyon observed that Thwing was executed for conspiracy, despite the logical difficulty of a conspiracy without any other conspirators.Kenyon, J.P., The Popish Plot, 1972"]}, {"page": "Claude La Colombi\u00e8re", "response": ["Colombi\u00e8re's zeal and the English climate soon combined to weaken his health and a pulmonary condition threatened to end his work in that country.
