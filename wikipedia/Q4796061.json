On 10 May 2012, Sheffield Wednesday confirmed their first pre-season friendly. This was to be against West Bromwich Albion at home on 4 August. On 15 May, the Owls released several players, these were young goalkeeper's Sean Cuff and Richard O'Donnell, who had spent the later stages of the previous season on loan. Also Jon Otsemobor, Chris Sedgwick, Clinton Morrison, and Vadaine Oliver were released. Meanwhile, in the youth squad, Matthew Tumilty who had made one appearance for the club the previous season was released. Lee Wall, Scott Canham and Tom Rowbotham were also released. Whereas youth player Mitcham Husbands remains at the club for a further year, and 2011\u201312 Academy Player of the Year Jarrod Kyle accepted his first-year professional contract.

A day after this Wednesday are due to fly to Portugal for their pre-season tour where they will play two unconfirmed teams before arriving back in England to play recently relegated Doncaster Rovers away on 28 July. The club's last pre-season friendly has already been confirmed to be against West Bromwich Albion on 4 August. Five days later the club announced their first signing ready for the new season. Ex-England international goalkeeper Chris Kirkland joined the club on a free transfer from Wigan Athletic. This is after the club released two goalkeeper's and had yet to confirm if other goalkeeper's Stephen Bywater and Arron Jameson had re-signed with the club, their previous contracts had expired that summer. However a day after this it was confirmed that one of these goalkeeper's had signed a new two-year contract at the club. Wednesday Academy product Arron Jameson signed to make his stay at the club last up to six-years by 2014. Jameson had only ever made two appearances for the club, both against Milton Keynes Dons. On 28 May 2012 the Owls confirmed the highly expected capture of defender Kieran Lee on a free transfer and a three-year contract. The signing of Lee had been expected to be confirmed at any time within the last two weeks after an Oldham Athletic member of staff confirmed that they could not compete with a club of Sheffield Wednesday's position and stature. After confirming a pre-season friendly with Kilmarnock as a testimonial for James Fowler, Sheffield Wednesday signed another free-agent. Joe Mattock signed on a three-year-contract after his contract ran out at West Bromwich Albion. On 14 June 2012, 2012\u201313 Football League Cup draw was made and Wednesday found out which team they would play in their first competitive match of the season. The Owls were drawn away to Oldham Athletic, a team who the side will be familiar with after being in the same league as them the previous season. Later that same day Sheffield Wednesday revealed the game would be live on Sky Sports, and be a day earlier than the majority of the rest of the games in Round 1, on Monday 13 August. 4 days after the League Cup draw, the fixtures for the 2012\u201313 Football League Championship were announced. It was confirmed that Wednesday's league campaign would kick-off away to Derby County, with their first home game three days later against last season's play-off semi-finalists Birmingham City. This would be followed by another home fixture against Millwall the following weekend. Yorkshire derbies against Huddersfield Town will take place on Tuesday 18 September and Saturday 29 December, while the local derby against Leeds United will take place at home on 20 October and away on 13 April. And the other local rivalry with Barnsley will take place away on 15 December and at home on 30 March. Sheffield Wednesday will play Bolton Wanderers on Boxing Day away, and the season will end at Hillsborough Stadium against Middlesbrough. Meanwhile, as well as the league fixtures being announced Sheffield Wednesday confirmed their final pre-season friendly, this was announced to be against Sporting Lisbon on 22 July while on tour in Portugal. The long anticipated signing of defender Anthony Gardner was made on 20 June 2012. The signing again was on a free transfer and the thirty-one-year-old signed on a two-year contract from Crystal Palace. It was however speculated that same morning that Gardner may not be signing for Wednesday after all, and that Dave Jones was getting impatient, with interest from Chinese clubs as well. However, just hours later the deal was done and the Owls made their fourth summer signing. The day after this Sheffield Wednesday completed another signing, this time in the forward position, with Chris Maguire signing on an undisclosed fee from Derby County on a three-year contract. With June coming to a close it was time for players who had been offered contracts to either agree terms or look to play elsewhere. Goalkeeper Stephen Bywater signed a new deal to keep him with the club for a further season, meaning a total of four potential first-team goalkeeper's were now at the club. Then two days later on 29 June, Sheffield Wednesday Academy product Mark Beevers signed a two-year deal which would see his Sheffield Wednesday professional career span to seven-years. On 6 July 2012, rumours became official of assistant manager Terry Burton joining Premier League side Arsenal to take on their Reserve and Head of Development Coach role. Burton had only been in the assistant manager role since March, after joining Wednesday just after manager Dave Jones. Finally on 9 July 2012, Jamaican Jermaine Johnson sign with the club\u2014all four were with Sheffield. JJ in his early-thirties will stay at the club for at least another year. One day later Sheffield Wednesday made their sixth signing of the summer by signing Portugal U-21 midfielder Diogo Amado. The player signs on a two-year contract from Uniao Leiria.", "The most anticipated signing for fans was finally completed on 6 August, after a successful third bid. Last season's promotion 'hero' Michail Antonio had finally joined the Owls on a four-year contract from Reading for an undisclosed fee rumoured to be around \u00a31.2\u00a0million. The final pre-season game for Sheffield Wednesday took place as a testimonial match for James Fowler, the Kilmarnock player. First-half goals from trialist Marlon Harewood and Chris O'Grady gave Wednesday a half-time lead. Although, a goal from Manuel Pascali pulled a goal back for Kilmarnock at the beginning of the second half. However, what was a fairly weaker Wednesday side, scored two late goals as Marlon Harewood grabbed his hat-trick, in hope to persuade manager Dave Jones to offer him a contract. With so many new signings and very few player departures the squad was seen to be 'too big'. Dave Jones does have plans to get rid of some players with a number of players' futures being questioned. On 9 August out-of-favour left-back Mark Reynolds went out on loan to Aberdeen for the second consecutive season. This time however it was a season-long loan and Reynolds looks like he would not play for the Owls again as his contract runs out at the end of this season. The weekend of 11 August 2012 saw the end of pre-season for all The Football League clubs below the Premier League as the 2012\u201313 League Cup kicked off. Half the fixtures of the first round took place that weekend, while others on the Tuesday and Wednesday of the following week. Meanwhile, Sheffield Wednesday were in-between on the Monday as they played Oldham Athletic, away and live on Sky Sports. As the first competitive game approached it meant manager Dave Jones had to confirm and announce the squad numbers for the season. New goalkeeper Chris Kirkland was given the number one jersey, while Michail Antonio was given the number seven. Goalkeeper's Nicky Weaver and Arron Jameson were not assigned numbers; Jameson had recently re-signed and it was thought the future of Weaver at the club was uncertain. Meanwhile, left-back Julian Bennett was not given a number which increased speculation about who no longer had a future with the club.", "|Arron Jameson", "| Arron Jameson", "| Arron Jameson"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 York City F.C. season", "response": ["Mills was dismissed after nearly two and a half years in charge on 2 March 2013 after York were beaten 2\u20130 at home to Bradford, with the team sitting four points above the relegation zone after an 11-match run without a win.

Mills' remaining coaching staff of Darron Gee, Des Lyttle and Paul Musselwhite left the club.
