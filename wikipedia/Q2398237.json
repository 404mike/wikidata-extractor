Darvall at East Maitland and was defeated; but in the following year, was elected for Kiama. In January 1866 the premier, Charles Cowper, resigned in consequence of an amendment moved by Parkes having been carried. Strictly speaking the governor should have asked Parkes whether he could form a government, but Sir James Martin was sent for and Parkes was given the position of Colonial Secretary. This ministry remained in office for nearly three years, from January 1866 to October 1868. An important piece of legislation carried through was the Public Schools Act 1866, introduced by Parkes, which required teachers to have training and created a funding mechanism. A council of education was formed, and for the first four years after the passing of the act Parkes filled the office of president. As a result of the act, many new schools were established all over the colony. Parkes also initiated the introduction of nurses from England trained by Florence Nightingale.", "In 1873 the retirement of Sir Alfred Stephen, the Chief Justice, led Parkes into controversy. Parkes appears to have encouraged his Attorney-General, E. Butler to believe that he would be appointed Chief Justice of New South Wales. Opposition developed in many quarters and Parkes decided to appoint Sir James Martin instead. When the announcement of his appointment was made on 11 November 1873, Butler took the opportunity to make a statement, read publicly the correspondence between Parkes and himself, and resigned his seat in the cabinet. Parkes was accused of manoeuvring to get rid of Butler, who was seen as an opponent within Parkes' faction, but no evidence was found to support this."]}, {"page": "James Martin", "response": ["*James Martin (Scottish actor) (born 1931), Scottish actor on Still Game", "*James Martin (attorney), U.S. Attorney in Missouri", "*James Martin II (1826\u20131918), American Medal of Honor recipient", "*James Martin (1738\u20131810), British banker and politician who sat in the House of Commons for 31 years from 1776 to 1807", "*James Martin (1807\u20131878), British Liberal Party politician and banker ", "*James Martin (Australian politician) (1820\u20131886), Premier of New South Wales", "*James Martin (South Australian politician) (1821\u20131899), engineer and politician of Gawler, South Australia", "*James Martin (New South Wales politician) (1850\u20131898), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for South Sydney and Sydney-Bligh", "*James Martin (trade unionist) (1850\u20131933), British trade unionist and politician", "*James Martin (Irish politician) (1905\u20131969), Fianna F\u00e1il Senator from 1965 to 1969", "*James Martin (Maine politician) (born 1965), member of the Maine House of Representatives", "*James Martin (mayor), Republican mayor of Ansonia, Connecticut, 1969\u20131971", "*James Martin (South Carolina politician) (died 1868), member of the South Carolina House of Representatives", "*James Martin (Queensland politician) (born 1981), Queensland politician (elected 2021)", "*James Martin (priest, born 1960), American Jesuit priest and writer", "*James Martin (cricketer) (1851\u20131930), Australian cricketer", "*James Martin (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u20131940), Scottish footballer", "*James Martin (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u20131969), English footballer", "*James Martin (American football) (born 1944), head college football coach at Tuskegee University", "*James Martin (rugby league) (born 1987), British rugby player", "*James Martin (footballer, born 1994) (born 1994), Scottish footballer", "*James Martin (footballer, born 1998), English footballer", "*James Martin (philosopher) (fl. 1577), Scottish writer", "*James Martin (convict) (c. 1760\u2013?), convict transported to New South Wales, author of the only extant First Fleet convict account of life in the colony", "*James Martin (author) (1933\u20132013), computer systems design author, writer", "*Sir James Martin (engineer) (1893\u20131981), inventor of the modern aircraft ejection seat", "*James Martin (chef) (born 1972), British celebrity chef", "*James Martin (photographer), American photojournalist", "*James Martin & Co, Australian engineering firm", "*James Martin House (disambiguation)", "*Martin High School (Arlington, Texas), also known as James Martin High School"]}, {"page": "Waverley Cemetery", "response": ["Inside its boundaries, the cemetery forms its own enclosed townscape where, apart from the ocean view to the east, all other major views are within the cemetery itself across its own landscape and monuments.

Following Donaldson's resignation in August, Cowper was asked to form Government, but he had no more success than Donaldson in establishing majority support, and was in particular attacked over his choice for Attorney General, James Martin, who had not yet been admitted as a barrister.

Until the late 19th century, only the section between Pitt Street and Castlereagh Street existed in anything resembling the present form, as a short street named Moore Street. Between Pitt Street and George Street there was only a small laneway (similar to nearby surviving laneways such as Angel Place or Hosking Place). In 1863, construction began on the present General Post Office Building on the south side of the laneway. The building was constructed in stages, and when the design changed to provide for a main fa\u00e7ade on the longer north side (instead of facing George Street to the west), there were concomitant proposals to widen the existing laneway into a street connected to Moore Street. A fire which destroyed properties to the north of the laneway provided the impetus for the construction, and in 1892 (a year after the Venetian-Italianate-style General Post Office was completed) the widened street was officially opened and named \"Martin Place\", in honour of New South Wales premier and Chief Justice James Martin. The General Post Office occupied the entire southern frontage of the street."]}, {"page": "Division of Martin", "response": ["The Division was named after Hon Sir James Martin, a former Premier of New South Wales.

On leaving school about the year 1833 Robertson went to sea and worked his passage to England where, through the medium of some letters of introduction, he accidentally came in contact with Lord Palmerston. The personality of the young man so impressed Palmerston that he invited him to stay with him for a few days in the country. There he introduced him to various distinguished people, and afterwards, when he was leaving England, gave him a letter to the New South Wales governor, Sir Richard Bourke.", "Robertson rejoined the ministry in August 1870 as Secretary for Lands.
