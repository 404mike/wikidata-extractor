Lycett is primarily known for his success in doubles, winning 5 men's doubles and 3 mixed doubles slams. He was also the runner-up at the 1922 Wimbledon men's singles (where he lost to Gerald Patterson).Lycett was recognised as one of the dominant players in men's doubles. He was the champion at both the Australasian Championships and Wimbledon multiple times. In April 1924 he won the singles title at the inaugural British Hard Court Championships in Torquay defeating Christiaan van Lennep in the final in four sets. He played in three ties for the British Davis Cup team in 1921 and 1923 and compiled a record of six wins and three losses.\nHis cousin was the operatic soprano Miriam Licette.\nIn the 1921 Wimbledon Quarter Final, Randolph Lycett played Zenzo Shimizu on a very hot day. During the third set, Lycett was revived with gin each time Ends were changed. In the Fifth Set, he ordered a bottle of champagne, and was drinking it when the Umpire announced \"Shimizu leads by nine games to eight in the Final Set\". Lycett dropped his racket, and began to search for it on his hands and knees.", "link_mentions": {}}}
