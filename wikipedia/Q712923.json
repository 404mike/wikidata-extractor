Lycett is primarily known for his success in doubles, winning 5 men's doubles and 3 mixed doubles slams. He was also the runner-up at the 1922 Wimbledon men's singles (where he lost to Gerald Patterson).Lycett was recognised as one of the dominant players in men's doubles. He was the champion at both the Australasian Championships and Wimbledon multiple times. In April 1924 he won the singles title at the inaugural British Hard Court Championships in Torquay defeating Christiaan van Lennep in the final in four sets. He played in three ties for the British Davis Cup team in 1921 and 1923 and compiled a record of six wins and three losses.\nHis cousin was the operatic soprano Miriam Licette.\nIn the 1921 Wimbledon Quarter Final, Randolph Lycett played Zenzo Shimizu on a very hot day. During the third set, Lycett was revived with gin each time Ends were changed. In the Fifth Set, he ordered a bottle of champagne, and was drinking it when the Umpire announced \"Shimizu leads by nine games to eight in the Final Set\". Lycett dropped his racket, and began to search for it on his hands and knees.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Championships, Wimbledon", "response": ["| 1919, 1921, 1923 (with Randolph Lycett), 1927 (with Frank Hunter), 1928 (with Patrick Spence), 1930 (with Jack Crawford), 1932 (with Enrique Maier)"]}, {"page": "1922 in sports", "response": ["* Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship \u2013 Gerald Patterson (Australia) defeats Randolph Lycett (Great Britain) 6\u20133 6\u20134 6\u20132"]}, {"page": "Three-peat", "response": ["*1921\u201322  Randolph Lycett (his partners were  Max Woosnam in the 1921 tournament,  James Anderson in 1922, and  Leslie Godfree)"]}, {"page": "Suzanne Lenglen", "response": ["Many tournaments resumed in 1919, following the end of World War I. Lenglen won nine singles titles in ten events, all four of her doubles events, and eight mixed doubles titles in ten events. She won the South of France Championships in March without dropping a game in any of her four matches. Although the French Championships and World Hard Court Championships did not return until the following year, Lenglen was able to debut at Wimbledon in July. She won the six-round All Comers' bracket, only losing six games in the first four rounds. Her biggest challenge in the All Comers' competition was her doubles partner Ryan, who saved match points and levelled the second set of their semifinal at five games, only losing after an hour-long rain delay. Although the 20-year-old Lenglen was considered a favourite against the 40-year-old Lambert Chambers in the challenge round, Lambert Chambers was able to trouble Lenglen with well-placed drop shots. Lenglen won the first set 10\u20138 after both players saved two set points. After saving two match points, Lenglen won the third set 9\u20137 for her first Wimbledon title. The match set the record for most games in a Wimbledon women's singles final with 44, only since surpassed by the 1970 final between Margaret Court and Billie Jean King. Over 8,000 people attended the match, well above the seating capacity of 3500 on Centre Court. Lenglen defeated Lambert Chambers and Ethel Larcombe again in the doubles final with Ryan. She already lost to Ryan and Randolph Lycett in the her mixed doubles quarterfinal, her only loss of the year in any discipline aside from defaults."]}, {"page": "List of Wimbledon mixed doubles champions", "response": ["| 1919 ||  Randolph Lycett   Elizabeth Ryan ||  Albert Prebble   Dorothea Lambert Chambers || 6\u20130, 6\u20130", "| 1920 ||  Gerald Patterson   Suzanne Lenglen ||  Randolph Lycett   Elizabeth Ryan || 7\u20135, 6\u20133", "| 1921 ||  Randolph Lycett   Elizabeth Ryan ||  Max Woosnam   Phyllis Howkins || 6\u20133, 6\u20131", "| 1922 ||  Pat O'Hara Wood   Suzanne Lenglen ||  Randolph Lycett   Elizabeth Ryan || 6\u20134, 6\u20133 ", "| 1923 ||  Randolph Lycett   Elizabeth Ryan ||  Lewis Deane   Dorothy Shepherd-Barron || 6\u20134, 7\u20135"]}]}}
