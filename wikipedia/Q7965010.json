It argued the case for the Goldfields' separation from Western Australia and the formation of a new Colony/State in the Goldfields, named \"Auralia\". In early 1900, Walter Griffiths travelled to London on behalf of the Eastern Goldfields Reform League executive, to present the petition to the British government and lobby the Colonial Office to either approve Auralia's separation, or force Western Australia to accept Federation.
