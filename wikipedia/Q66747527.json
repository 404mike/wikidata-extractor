Sir Howard Colvin suggests that he may have come to Louth from Brereton in Staffordshire around 1832.  Most of the work that he undertook was the building or restoration of churches and designing rectories and vicarages. He also appears to have been closely connected with the laying out and construction of houses at Cleethorpes, following the Enclosure Act in 1842. This was a period of rapid development at Cleethorpes, as it developed into a popular sea bathing resort. He had a house in Upgate, Louth and also an office in Westgate, Louth. He was a great collector of antiquities and had an extensive architectural library and collection of drawings. Following his death an auction sale was held of his possessions, which lasted for four days. Following his death, he may have been succeeded in his Louth practice by Maughan and Fowler.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Carter", "response": ["*Charles John Carter (died 1851), English architect and surveyor "]}, {"page": "James Fowler (architect)", "response": ["Fowler was born in Lichfield. He was a pupil of Lichfield architect Joseph Potter junior.Colvin, H; A Biographical Dictionary of English Architects, 1600\u20131840; Yale University Press, revised 3rd edition (1995),  He came to Louth in 1849, when he was employed in the construction of the Louth House of Correction (demolished 1885). He was probably working for James Sandby Padley, who was the County Surveyor for the Lincolnshire parts of Lindsey. He undertook other work for Padley, including illustrations of the Lincoln Greyfriars in Padley's Selections from the Ancient Monastic Ecclesiastical and Domestic edifices of Lincolnshire which was published in 1851.  At Louth he was initially in partnership with Joseph Maughan, a surveyor and lithographer in Grimsby. The partnership lasted from 1851 until June 1859. On dissolution, it was agreed that the Surveying Department will hereafter be conducted by Mr. Maughan, and the Architectural Department by Mr. Fowler, at their usual places of business in both towns (Grimsby and Louth).

The exact reasons for Pevsner\u2019s attribution are unclear, except for some similarity with the church at Whaplode Drove. A sixth church in a similar style at Eastville is known to have been designed in 1840 by the Louth architect Charles John Carter."]}]}}
