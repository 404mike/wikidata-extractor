After an apprenticeship with a touring company he was engaged by the impresarios George Edwardes and Robert Courtneidge to play comic roles in musical comedy. He also played in variety shows and, later in his career, in farce.\nRolyat's greatest success was probably in the double role of John Smith and Simplicitas in The Arcadians (1909), first in the West End of London and then in the British provinces. While playing the role on tour he suffered a severe accident that threatened to end his career. He recovered and worked on until the mid-1920s when ill-health forced him to retire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tom Jones (Edward German)", "response": ["The opera premiered at the Prince's Theatre in Manchester, England, on 3 April 1907, opening in London at the Apollo Theatre on 17 April 1907 for an initial run of 110 performances.

A silent film version was made in 1927, and the piece was popular with amateur theatre groups, particularly in Britain, through the 20th century.

The Dundee Courier praised the story of a girl from a rigidly righteous (unco guid) family, who runs away to the music hall stage and then returns, but the Manchester Couriers review lamented that the show's own music hall format gave limited scope to 'clever players' from the 'legitimate' theatre, such as Aylwin. In 1914 she received press coverage for inspiring a style of dress \"in crepe and lace\". In 1915, she starred in a second Scottish-themed show, All Scotch. The show was described as a \"tartan revue\" and culminated in a sequence in which Aylwin appeared as Bonnie Prince Charlie. The Manchester Courier described the revue as \"probably one of the best which has been to Manchester\" and commended the wit and humour, observing that Aylwin \"sings and dances charmingly\". Later that year, she supported the comedian Dan Rolyat in his revue She's a Daisy, at the Manchester Hippodrome, and performed in benefit concerts to support the war effort. In February 1916, All Scotch was revived at Her Majesty's Theatre, Dundee, where Aylwin's part was again praised as \"charming\" by the press."]}, {"page": "Alfred Lester", "response": ["The Arcadians in 1909 confirmed Lester's reputation as a leading West End performer.
