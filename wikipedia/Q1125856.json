In the eighteenth century, she inspired writers like Matthew Lewis (1775 \u2013 1818) and the Marquis de Sade (1740\u20131814), who praised her work but produced more intensely violent fiction. Radcliffe is known for having spawned a large number of lesser imitators of the \"Radcliffe School\", such as Harriet Lee and Catherine Cuthbertson. Jane Austen (1775 \u2013 1817) defined her fiction as a contrast to Radcliffe and writers like her, especially in Northanger Abbey (1817), Austen's parody of The Mysteries of Udolpho.
