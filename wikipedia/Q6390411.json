MacDonald perfected a cool, debonair demeanor, which usually masked an evil side as a con man, outlaw, or thief. His speaking voice was rich and well modulated, often being gentle and ominous at the same time, in the Boris Karloff manner. Also, like Karloff, he seldom raised his voice, making his characters both dominant and dangerous. This quality made MacDonald an effective villain in Columbia's adventure serials (like Mandrake the Magician and The Phantom). He was also adept at playing sympathetic roles, usually as calm authority figures (police official, prison psychiatrist, judges, etc.).", "Actors in Columbia's stock company almost always worked in the studio's two-reel comedy shorts as well as features and serials, but Kenneth MacDonald did not join the short-subject fraternity until 1945, when he appeared opposite comedy stars Gus Schilling and Richard Lane.

He was then awarded one of two available bursaries, enabling him to undertake a one-year post-graduate course at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. After completing his studies he entered repertory theatre at Ipswich, before getting his first television work in advertisements.
