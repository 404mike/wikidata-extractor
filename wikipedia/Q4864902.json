In November 2003, they defeated Airdrie United 2\u20130 with goals from Steve Hislop and David Bingham to win the Scottish Challenge Cup, and also reached the Scottish Cup semi-final, losing a replay 3\u20132 to Dunfermline Athletic after a 1\u20131 draw at Hampden Park. However, the greatest achievement was on the final day of the season, when Inverness defeated St Johnstone 3\u20131, with goals from Paul Ritchie, David Bingham and Barry Wilson and, as a result, pipped Clyde to the First Division title. This made the club eligible for promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL). However, SPL rules at that time stated that all member clubs must have a stadium with a minimum capacity of 10,000 seats. Caledonian Stadium did not meet this criterion, leaving the club's Board with a dilemma: either to remain in the First Division (like Falkirk the previous season) or to groundshare with Aberdeen, over 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away. After consulting with supporters, the Board decided the 'sacrifice' of one season in Aberdeen would be an acceptable compromise to ensure Premier League participation for the club.", "A change in SPL rules during the 2004\u201305 season reduced the stadium seating requirement to 6,000 seats for SPL membership. The Caledonian Stadium was rendered a valid SPL venue after a rapid ground expansion, with two new stands added. The stadium was renamed as the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium in honour of the local building firm that completed the work in only 47 working days.  The chairman of Tulloch, David Sutherland, was also chairman of the club at the time and remains a major shareholder.  The club returned to playing in Inverness, defeating Dunfermline 2\u20130 in their first SPL game in their own ground on 29 January 2005, thanks to goals from Barry Wilson and then player-manager Craig Brewster.", "| Coach || Barry Wilson", "* Last SFL goal of the old millennium and First SFL goal of the new millennium: Barry Wilson against Clydebank (27 December 1999) and Livingston (3 January 2000) respectively."]}, {"page": "Ross County F.C.", "response": ["Their main rivals are fellow Highlanders, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, with whom they contest the Highland derby.
