He served during World War I, rising to the rank of lieutenant general, and was also the one-hundred and eighth civil Governor and military Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda (the office of Commander-in-Chief, Bermuda was re-titled General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Bermuda at the same time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Anglian Regiment", "response": ["The Royal Anglian Regiment has a unique relationship with the Royal Bermuda Regiment (RBR), a Territorial battalion of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda. Although the Royal Bermuda Regiment is usually described as an affiliated regiment, its relationship to the Regiment is more akin to that of one of Royal Anglian's own TA battalions. The Royal Bermuda Regiment is an amalgamation of the old Bermuda Militia Artillery and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC, which had been renamed the Bermuda Rifles). The 2nd Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment, one of Royal Anglian Regiment's predecessors, was serving in the Bermuda Garrison when the First World War began in 1914 and its Commanding Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel George Bunbury McAndrew, found himself acting Governor and Commander-In-Chief of Bermuda, in the absence of the Governor Lieutenant-General Sir George Bullock, and oversaw the colony's placement onto a war footing. The battalion left Bermuda for France in October, 1914. The BVRC formed an overseas contingent, composed of Captain Richard Tucker and 88 other ranks, in December, which was intended to join the 2nd Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment on the Western Front, but which was instead attached to the 1 Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment in June, 1915, as it had greater need for reinforcements. A second BVRC contingent, of one officer and 36 other ranks, arrived from Bermuda the following year and merged with the dozen survivors of the first contingent. The BVRC contingent served with 1 Lincolns in France, Belgium and Ireland until 1919. The affiliation of the Lincolns and the BVRC was made official after the War, with the Lincolns adopting the same role it fulfilled to its own TA battalions: providing seconded Permanent Staff Instructors and officers. The BVRC sent two more drafts to the Lincolns during the Second World War (in 1940 and 1944). When the BVRC was amalgamated into the Bermuda Regiment in 1965 (the Royal Bermuda Regiment from 2015), the Royal Anglian Regiment, as successor to the Royal Lincolns, continued the paternal relationship. In addition to providing a PSI to each of the Royal Bermuda Regiment's rifle companies, many other Royal Anglian Regiment personnel have been seconded or loaned to the Royal Bermuda Regiment over the years. The staff officer is normally seconded from the Royal Anglians. The Bermuda Regiment's first nine adjutants (from 1965 to 1984) were all Royal Anglian officers. Three of its past regimental sergeant majors were seconded from the Royal Anglian Regiment. In 1992, the Royal Bermuda Regiment had two serving lieutenant-colonels, as its staff officer, a Royal Anglian major, was promoted to the same rank as its commanding officer (CO). In 1996, the Royal Bermuda Regiment's second-in-command, staff officer, and adjutant were all on secondment from the Royal Anglians. Additionally, senior NCOs are loaned to the Royal Bermuda Regiment for the duration of its annual recruit camps, with one attached to each platoon of its training company."]}, {"page": "Seth Bullock", "response": ["His father, retired British Army Sergeant Major and hero George Bullock, was known to be active in the politics of Sandwich, Upper Canada (later renamed Windsor, Ontario). He has been mistakenly believed to be related to British General Sir George Bullock, who was actually younger than Seth. Seth's mother was a Scotswoman named Anna Findley Bullock.", "By 1860, Bullock's father, George Bullock, was forced to resign his position as County Treasurer due to missing funds. To avoid prosecution in Canada, Bullock's father fled across the border to Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., leaving his eight children alone in Sandwich, Ontario, Canada. Bullock's mother had died during this time, so the children were left to take care of themselves. And, the property owned by Bullock's father in Sandwich was either seized by his creditors or sold at public auction in 1863, as he had defaulted on his mortgage and other debt obligations."]}, {"page": "Royal Lincolnshire Regiment", "response": ["The Commanding Officer of 2nd Lincolns, Lieutenant-Colonel George Bunbury McAndrew, found himself acting Governor and Commander-In-Chief of the Imperial fortress of Bermuda in the absence of the Governor, Lieutenant-General Sir George Bullock, and oversaw that colony's placement onto a war footing.
