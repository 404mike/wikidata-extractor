In addition to these cerebral topics, however, sexual desire features in the foreground of most of his films, whether the central event is medieval plague (The Seventh Seal), upper-class family activity in early twentieth century Uppsala (Fanny and Alexander), or contemporary alienation (The Silence). His female characters are usually more in touch with their sexuality than their male equivalents, and unafraid to proclaim it, sometimes with breathtaking overtness (as in Cries and Whispers) as would define the work of \"the conjurer,\" as Bergman called himself in a 1960 TIME cover story. In an interview with Playboy in 1964, he said: \"The manifestation of sex is very important, and particularly to me, for above all, I don't want to make merely intellectual films. I want audiences to feel, to sense my films. This to me is much more important than their understanding them.\" Film, Bergman said, was his demanding mistress. While he was a social democrat as an adult, Bergman stated that \"as an artist I'm not politically involved ... I don't make propaganda for either one attitude or the other.\"Bergman on Bergman: Interviews with Ingmar Bergman.

In 1901 he published Martin Birck's Youth.

He is unusual, even unique, among major poets in that almost all of his work was \"conceived to music\". His achievement has been compared to Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Hogarth. Bellman, however, was no great playwright, nor a major classical composer. His biographer, Paul Britten Austin, suggests that the comparison with Hogarth is closer to the mark. Bellman had a gift for using elegant classical references in comic contrast to the sordid realities of drinking and prostitution. The way he does this, at once regretting and celebrating these excesses in song, achieves something of what Hogarth achieved in engravings and paint. The art historian Axel Romdahl describes Bellman's sensibility as if he had been a painter: \"An unusual swiftness of apprehension, both optical and aural, must have distinguished him.\"Britten Austin, 1967, page 125. Britten Austin agrees with this, noting that \"When [Bellman's] words and music have faded into silence it is the visual image which remains.\" Jan Sj\u00e5vik comments in the Historical Dictionary of Scandinavian Literature and Theater that \"Bellman's achievement consists in taking this humble and unrecognized literary form [the drinking song] and raising it to a genre that became impossible to ignore, while in the process creating songs and characters that have become an indispensable part of Sweden's literary and cultural heritage.\"", "* 1977: Fredman's Epistles and songs, Stockholm: Reuter and Reuter.
