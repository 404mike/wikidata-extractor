Bands like Of Mice & Men, Emmure, Issues and My Ticket Home would combine nu metal with metalcore or deathcore. Artists like Grimes, Poppy and Rina Sawayama would integrate nu metal sounds into electronic pop music in the late 2010s and early 2020s.", "Electronic and art pop singer-songwriters incorporated nu metal into their sound in the late 2010s and 2020s. Poppy has incorporated nu metal on her albums Am I A Girl? and I Disagree, Grimes on album Miss Anthropocene and Rina Sawayama on Sawayama. The singles \"We Appreciate Power\" and \"Play Destroy\" were pioneering examples. Poppy has described this fusion as \"nu-Poppy\" or \"Poppymetal\". I Disagree received critical acclaim for this fusion, with single \"Bloodmoney\" nominated for the 2021 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, making her the first female solo artist to be nominated for the award in its history. Dorian Electra incorporated nu metal influences on their album My Agenda, as did Ashnikko on Demidevil, particularly on single \"Cry\". The Guardian noted that these mostly female artists have revived a previously male-dominated genre and successfully adapted it to showcase a female perspective. Rina Sawayama said \"metal itself lends itself to toxic masculine tropes, but it\u2019s also almost taking the piss out of a very masculine expression of emotion\u201d.", "Nu metal is credited for influencing modern rap artists and even pop artists like Billie Eilish. And has served as inspiration for genres like Hyperpop. Kerrang! magazine said: \"Nu-metal\u2019s hybrid of hip-hop, metal, funk, industrial and beyond lends itself perfectly to the hyperpop ideology. Linkin Park, Papa Roach and other artists from the time have hits that are now considered to be modern classics that still crop up on movie soundtracks and party playlists \u2013 in fact, hyperpop superstars 100 gecs recently remixed Linkin Park\u2019s megahit One Step Closer for Hybrid Theory\u2019s 20th anniversary. Rico Nasty, meanwhile, who blends punk and rap \u2013 and is known for the hyperpop hit IPHONE \u2013 takes a lot of cues from nu-metal in her work. But one of the main artists known for bringing nu-metal back is Rina Sawayama. On her 2020 debut album SAWAYAMA, she chose to emulate the music that was popular during her childhood in the 2000s. Sure, this meant a lot of pop, but rock acts were also topping the charts at the time. The result? Rina was able to pull from plenty of rock-leaning artists like Avril Lavigne, N.E.R.D. and No Doubt, but also nu-metal luminaries like Limp Bizkit and Evanescence.\""]}, {"page": "Reno, Nevada", "response": ["Rina Sawayama included the lyrics \"Every time you see me / It's like winning big in Reno\" in her 2020 song Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons (Like The Boys)."]}, {"page": "Christina Aguilera", "response": ["Critics also highlighted the impact of her work in popular culture; while Stripped (2002) was cited as \"the blueprint for divas making the transition from teen idol to adult pop star\", Aguilera is credited for \"paving the way for a generation of pop singers\".
