James Stirling followed this same idea when he built the famous Dundee engine.", "James Stirling gave a presentation of his engine before the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1845. The first engine of this kind which, after various modifications, was efficiently constructed and heated, had a cylinder of 12 inches (approx. 30\u00a0cm) in diameter, with a length of stroke of 2 feet (approx. 61\u00a0cm), and made 40 strokes or revolutions in a minute (40 rpm). This engine moved all the machinery at the Dundee Foundry Company's works for eight or ten months, and was previously found capable of raising 700,000\u00a0lbs one foot in a minute (approx. 21 HP).", "This gives a consumption of 2.7\u00a0lbs. (approx. 1.22\u00a0kg) per horse-power per hour; but when the engine was not fully burdened, the consumption was considerably under 2.5\u00a0lbs. (approx. 1.13\u00a0kg) per horse-power per hour. This performance was at the level of the best steam engines whose efficiency was about 10%. After James Stirling, such efficiency was possible only thanks to the use of the economiser (or regenerator).", "* James Stirling, born 2 October 1835, became a locomotive engineer"]}, {"page": "James Stirling", "response": ["James Stirling may refer to:", "*James Stirling (mathematician) (1692\u20131770), Scottish mathematician", "*Sir James Stirling, 1st Baronet (c.1740?\u20131805), Scottish banker and lord provost of Edinburgh", "*Sir James Stirling (Royal Navy officer) (1791\u20131865), Governor of Western Australia", "*James Stirling (1800\u20131876), Scottish engineer", "*James Stirling (1835\u20131917), Scottish locomotive engineer", "*Sir James Stirling (judge) (1836\u20131916), British jurist", "*Sir James Stirling (architect) (1926\u20131992), architect", "*James Stirling (physicist) (1953\u20132018), Provost of Imperial College London", "*James Stirling (footballer), Scottish association football player"]}, {"page": "South Eastern Railway (England)", "response": ["After a brief interregnum James Stirling was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer on 28 March 1878.

Early locomotive classes that worked the line include the \"Little Mail\", and \"Mail\" class 2-2-2s. By the 1860s the speed limit on the line was . In those days, shingle was used for ballast. This was fine for the speeds and train weights then in use, but would later prove to be less satisfactory as train speed increased and weights got heavier. The use of shingle ballast was a factor in a serious accident at Sevenoaks in 1927. In the 1870s, James Stirling introduced a number of new classes - the B and F class 4-4-0s for express passenger work. The O class 0-6-0s for freight and the A class 4-4-0s and Q class 0-4-4Ts for local passenger work. The R class 0-6-0Ts were built to perform banking duties on the branch from Folkestone Harbour to Folkestone Junction. Classes F, O and Q accounted for the majority of the 459 locomotives in the six classes. The SER and LCDR agreed in 1898 to form a working arrangement. The South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) came into being on 1 January 1899. The new company was short of locomotives and was glad to acquire five 4-4-0s that the Great North of Scotland Railway had ordered from Hurst, Nelson & Co Ltd, Glasgow but which subsequently had become surplus to requirements. These locomotives became the G class. In 1900, Harry Wainwright introduced the C class 0-6-0s for freight, and D and E class 4-4-0s for express passenger work.
