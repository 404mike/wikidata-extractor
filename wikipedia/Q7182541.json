In order to finance these deals he sold Chris Allen to Nottingham Forest for \u00a3450,000. Oxford knocked Premier League team Sheffield Wednesday out of the League Cup en route to a fourth round exit. Oxford were fifth in the table in December 1996, but chairman Robin Herd resigned amidst financial problems at the club, and work on the new stadium came to a halt as the club debt reached \u00a313\u00a0million. Smith raised funds by selling Elliott to Leicester for \u00a31.7\u00a0million, and signed veteran defender Chris Whyte on a free transfer as a short-term replacement. Oxford finished the season in 17th place, but the club's financial situation became ever bleaker. Numerous players were sold, though Smith was allowed to spend \u00a3170,000 on defender Phil Whelan. Smith left the Manor Ground midway through 1997\u201398 with Oxford 16th in the league, and his assistant Crosby managed to maintain the club's mid-table position at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Leo Roget", "response": ["Roget rejected the offer of a new one-year contract during the 2000 off-season and as he was too young to be given a free transfer under the Bosman ruling, he would remain at Roots Hall on a week-to-week contract during the 2000\u201301 season. He was again a regular in central defence alongside Phil Whelan, though new manager David Webb questioned in October 2000 \"if he (Roget) is only playing so well because he hasn't got a contract at the moment\". Having already accumulated seven yellow cards during the season, Webb was forced into showdown talks with \"bad boy\" Roget in January 2001. A 3\u20130 defeat to Halifax Town on 17 February 2001 would be Roget's final Southend United appearance, as he was dropped by David Webb shortly after.
