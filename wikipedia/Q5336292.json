In 1930 he joined the Inland Revenue, where he worked until 1944. He then became an accountant and more actively involved in politics. While his brother, Hugh, became a prominent Irish republican, involved in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Sinn F\u00e9in, Eddie chose nationalist politics. He was elected as the Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland) Member of Parliament for Mid Londonderry in the 1945 Northern Ireland general election. He was a founder member of the Anti-Partition League of Ireland, and became its vice chairman in 1947, then its chairman in 1953.\nIn 1952, McAteer was elected to Londonderry Corporation, and the following year he switched to represent Foyle in the Northern Ireland House of Commons. He left the City Council in 1958, and became the Deputy Leader of the Nationalist Party at Stormont. He became prominent in the campaign calling for the establishment of a university in Derry.In 1964, he became its leader, and the following year accepted the post of Leader of the Opposition, although he lost his seat in the 1969 Northern Ireland general election to John Hume. While in his early career, he had been a militant nationalist, publishing Irish Action \u2013 a call for civil disobedience \u2013 with the start of The Troubles, he repeatedly called for moderation.In the 1970 United Kingdom general election, McAteer stood in Londonderry on the Unity slate, taking 36.6% of the vote. He again contested Londonderry in the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973 election, taking only 3,712 votes and narrowly missing being elected. With the ascendancy of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Nationalist Party was in disarray. McAteer took his remaining supporters into the Irish Independence Party in 1978, in which his son Fergus became prominent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Eddie McAteer, one-time leader of the Nationalist Party, was the brother of Hugh McAteer, a Sinn F\u00e9in and IRA activist, and the father of Fergus McAteer, a leader of the Irish Independence Party"]}, {"page": "1986 in Ireland", "response": ["*28 March \u2013 Eddie McAteer, Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland) MP (born 1914)."]}, {"page": "1965 in Ireland", "response": ["* 21 January \u2013 Nationalist leader Eddie McAteer visited Se\u00e1n Lemass in Dublin."]}, {"page": "1914 in Ireland", "response": ["*:*Eddie McAteer, Nationalist Party (Northern Ireland) MP (died 1986)."]}, {"page": "Nationalist Party (Ireland)", "response": ["*Eddie McAteer 1953\u20131959", "*Eddie McAteer 1965\u20131973"]}, {"page": "Derry/Londonderry name dispute", "response": ["In 1965, Eddie McAteer of the University for Derry Committee expressed the hope that the rare common cause between local unionists and nationalists would force the Stormont government to reverse its decision not to base the New University of Ulster there: \"The Government might be able to slap down the men of Derry.

It disrupted a meeting of Londonderry Corporation in March 1968 and in May blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of the Lecky Road in the Bogside and staging a sit-down protest at the opening of the second deck of the Craigavon Bridge.The Derry March \u2013 Chronology of Events Surrounding the March , Conflict Archive on the Internet. Retrieved 11 November 2008. After the meeting of Londonderry Corporation was again disrupted in August, Eamonn Melaugh telephoned the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) and invited them to hold a march in Derry. The date chosen was 5 October 1968, an ad hoc committee was formed (although in reality most of the organising was done by McCann and Melaugh) and the route was to take the marchers inside the city walls, where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 37 The Minister of Home Affairs, William Craig, made an order on 3 October prohibiting the march on the grounds that the Apprentice Boys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the same day.  In the words of Martin Melaugh of CAIN \"this particular tactic...provided the excuse needed to ban the march.\" When the marchers attempted to defy the ban on 5 October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) cordon.  The police drew their batons and struck marchers, including Stormont MP Eddie McAteer and Westminster MP Gerry Fitt.Lord Cameron, Disturbances in Northern Ireland, chapter 4, paragraph 49 Subsequently, the police \"broke ranks and used their batons indiscriminately on people in Duke Street\". Marchers trying to escape met another party of police and \"these police also used their batons indiscriminately.\"Lord Cameron, Disturbances in Northern Ireland, chapter 4, paragraph 51 Water cannons were also used. The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry, and at a meeting four days later the Derry Citizens' Action Committee (DCAC) was formed, with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vice-chairman.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 45"]}, {"page": "Hugh McAteer", "response": ["McAteer was the third son of Hugh McAteer, a labourer, and Bridget Doherty.
