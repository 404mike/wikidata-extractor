Most prolific in the 1980s and 1990s, he worked with artists such as Sheena Easton, The Babys, Robert Miles, Jennifer Rush, Bucks Fizz, Air Supply, Lucio Battisti, Zucchero, Lisa Stansfield and Brian May (for the Queen song \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\"). His collaboration with May was awarded Best Song Musically and Lyrically at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards.One of Musker's earlier successes was the 1977 North American hit \"Heaven On The 7th Floor\", written with co-writer Dominic Bugatti. It became a hit for Paul Nicholas and The Mighty Pope. Musker and Bugatti then collaborated with John Waite, frontman for The Babys at the time, to compose \"Back on My Feet Again\", which would become The Babys' last top 40 hit, peaking at #33 in 1980. Two years later, Musker and Bugatti recorded their duo album on Atlantic Records, entitled The Dukes. The album was produced by Arif Mardin and recorded and mixed by Gary Skardina at The Music Grinder Studios (Hollywood, California), Chelsea Sound and Atlantic Studios (New York), Maison Rouge, and Odyssey Studios (London).In 1984, Musker, as a solo artist, recorded the song \"Steely Man\", which was featured in the comedy film Grandview, U.S.A. and also released as a single.In 1998, Musker was a director at the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian May", "response": ["In the aftermath of the November 1991 death of Mercury, May chose to deal with his grief by committing himself as fully as possible to work, first by finishing his solo album, Back to the Light, and then touring worldwide to promote it. He frequently remarked in press interviews that this was the only form of self-prescribed therapy he could think of. According to Def Leppard lead singer Joe Elliott, \"It was undoubtedly an enormous and terrible blow to lose someone he was so close to. Personally, I know it ripped the heart out of Brian, but having said that, he was in great spirits after the album was finished.\" Back to the Light featured the single \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\", on which he collaborated as a songwriter with Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers. A version with Freddie Mercury's vocals was later released on the Queen album Made in Heaven and won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically & Lyrically in 1996."]}, {"page": "2nd Golden Raspberry Awards", "response": ["**\"You, You're Crazy\" from Honky Tonk Freeway\u00a0\u2013 Music and Lyrics by Frank Musker and Dominic Bugatti"]}, {"page": "Made in Heaven", "response": ["\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\" was composed by May, Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers sometime between the sessions for A Kind of Magic and The Miracle.Billboard 21 Jun 1997 Billboard Retrieved 16 January 2011 They wrote it in the US and Mercury sang on it.
