He remained an important member of the Greenock club's strong team in the era spanning World War I when they finished in the top four of the Scottish Football League for six seasons running, and won the War Fund Shield in 1915.Aged 34, Gourlay scored the only goal (with a free kick) in Morton's 1\u20130 win over Rangers in the 1922 Scottish Cup Final which is, to date, the club's only major trophy. He later had a short spell at Third Lanark.Gourlay played in the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots annual trial match in 1914 and was selected for the Scottish Football League XI either side of the war, but never gained a full international cap.
