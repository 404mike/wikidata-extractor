To make matters worse the club faced financial issues after the relegations, effectively ending their venture into professional football which saw most players leave. However, the finances and equity of SfB Prof ApS, the professional division of Svendborg fB, were normalised at an extraordinary general meeting on 26 November 2004 through a capital injection from the club's amateur division, retaining the majority shareholding, and businesses in south Funen, which meant that Svendborg fB would once again be eligible to receive a license from the Danish Football Union to conduct professional football in the event of a promotion to the Danish divisions. The club eventually won their group in the fifth division during the spring of 2005, and immediately returned to the Denmark Series. In their first season back in the fourth tier, Svendborg ended fifth in the table after having competed for promotion throughout most of the season under head coaching duo Ole Pedersen and player-coach Graham Easter. After a five-year absence from the divisions, the team managed to reach promotion to the third tier again in the 2007\u2013"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Danish Superliga players", "response": ["* Graham Easter \u2013 Viborg FF \u2013 1993\u201396 (15/0)"]}, {"page": "Easter (surname)", "response": ["*Graham Easter (born 1969), English footballer"]}]}}
