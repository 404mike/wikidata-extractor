In 2004, when Paradise Lost's drummer Lee Morris (the drummer who beat Singer in the Audition for the spot in the band in '94) quit, Singer was finally chosen to be in the band, which was conflicting for him as he was to be the drummer for another British Metal band Rise To Addiction, but committed to Paradise Lost just in time to play on the band's Forever After single, as the band were about to record it. Singer was not officially hired into the band until Paradise Lost's single The Enemy in 2007. Singer announced his departure from the band on 13 August 2008, just before a scheduled South American tour, because he wanted to be with his family and had an upcoming job. As a result, Paradise Lost had to cancel the South American tour dates they had planned, though they have since hired a new drummer, Adrian Erlandsson (At the Gates, Cradle of Filth), and reconfirmed the tour. There had been a few times that Singer filled in for Erlandsson on occasional Paradise Lost shows, when Erlandsson was unable to play for the band.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of drummers", "response": ["* Jeff Singer (Paradise Lost)"]}, {"page": "My Dying Bride", "response": ["On 4 December 2018, the band announced that Shaun Steels had been replaced by Jeff Singer due to \"unresolvable drumming issues\" and that the drum tracks for the new album had been completed by Singer.", "* Jeff Singer \u2013 drums "]}, {"page": "Paradise Lost (band)", "response": ["In March 2004, Lee Morris left the band due to \"personal and musical differences\" and was replaced by Jeff Singer.", "On 13 August 2008, drummer Jeff Singer announced his departure from the band on the Paradise Lost official website.
