He was particularly intrigued with the possibility that a fresh water lake existed north of the town. In a letter to Governor James Douglas Moody wrote: \"I now learn from the Indians that a lake does exist... Burnaby and Blake immediately volunteered their services to explore and also to trace the mouth to Burrard's Inlet and to report generally on the countryside north of the town. After a considerable reluctance on account of the weather I have let them go with four days' provisions in light marching order, not even tents, two Indians, a Canadian Voyageur attached to Parson's survey party and my own trusty Corporal Brown R.E.

Port Moody was established by Richard Clement, at the end of the trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet, to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US: it was, subsequently, named after him. Moody also established a townsite at Hastings, which was later absorbed into Vancouver. As part of the survey by the Royal Engineers, multiple tracts were designated as government reserves, including Stanley Park, an important strategic area that would have proven to be invaluable in the event of an American invasion, which was specified as a military reserve. The Pre-emption Act did not specify conditions for the distribution of the land, and, consequently, so large areas were bought by speculators.", "Margaret A. Ormsby, author of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography entry for Moody (2002), condemns Moody for a contribution to the abortive development of the city. However, almost all other historianswho have assessed Moody have considered him favourably, have exonerated him from culpability for the abortive development of New Westminster, and consider his achievement to be impressive, especially with regard to the perpetual insufficiency of funds and the personally motivated opposition of Douglas, whose opposition to the project continually retarded its development. Robert Burnaby observed that Douglas proceeded with \"muddling [Moody's] work and doubling his expenditure\" and with employing administrators to \"work a crooked policy against Moody\" to \"retard British Columbia and build up... the stronghold of Hudson's Bay interests\" and their own \"landed stake\". Therefore, Robert Edgar Cail, Don W. Thomson, Ishiguro, and Scott have praised Moody for his contribution, the latter accusing Ormsby of being 'adamant in her dislike of Colonel Moody' despite the evidence, and almost all biographies of Moody, including those of the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Royal Engineers, and the British Columbia Historical Association, are flattering."]}, {"page": "Robert Burnaby Park", "response": ["Robert Burnaby Park is a  public park in East Burnaby, just south of Burnaby Lake, located off Edmonds and 4th Street.
