King's support for the government's cuts was in spite of concerns within the bank that cutting spending so rapidly could derail the UK's nascent economic-recovery.

His wife admitted that she was having an affair with Mayer, but Mayer argued that the affair did not constitute adultery under New Hampshire law.", "After a lower court initially sided with David Blanchflower, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled in favor of the two women, concluding that adultery must meet the definition of sexual intercourse under New Hampshire law. In the 3-2 ruling, the majority determined that sexual relations between two females cannot constitute sexual intercourse and, therefore, the affair was not adultery. The decision was based on the 1961 edition of Webster's Third New International Dictionary, which defines sexual intercourse as coitus (penile-vaginal sex)."]}, {"page": "Stephen Nickell", "response": ["From 1998 until 2006 he returned to the London School of Economics as School Professor of Economics.

In the late 1970s, such research was unconventional. However, along with the important 1981 paper by McDonald and Solow in the American Economic Review, Oswald's work was to become standard in modern textbooks.  It included a 1982 paper, in The Economic Journal, which was the first to propose the idea of the \u2018utilitarian\u2019 trade union model. Later in the 1980s, he worked on theoretical aspects of labour contracts, with papers in the 1986 American Economic Review and the 1984 Quarterly Journal of Economics. A 1993 paper in Labour Economics argued that last-in-first-out layoff rules means that union indifference curves are locally horizontal. Then began a strand of empirical work on labour markets\u2014particularly the then-unconventional book The Wage Curve (with David Blanchflower), published by MIT Press in 1994. This documented the discovery of a power law\u2014with an exponent of approximately \u22120.1\u2014linking wages to the local unemployment rate. Unusually for that era, it used data on 5 million randomly sampled workers around the world; this book went on to win Princeton's Lester Prize. Replications of the wage-curve finding have been found in a large number of nations.  His other research on wage formation demonstrated the importance of rent-sharing in the labour market (Quarterly Journal of Economics 1992, Quarterly Journal of Economics 1996); it included it an Oxford University Press book co-authored with Alan Carruth. The fourth strand of work was on entrepreneurship.  This led in particular to a 1998 paper, with David Blanchflower, in the Journal of Labor Economics with the title \"What makes an entrepreneur?\".\"What Makes an Entrepreneur?\", David Blanchflower and Andrew J. Oswald, Journal of Labor Economics, 1998, 16, 26-60 http://www.andrewoswald.com/docs/entrepre.pdf This has become a principal reference in university and business-school courses. It is the most-cited paper of all time in JOLE. (source: Thomson Reuters Web of Science Database, 2013) Other work was on the idea that high rates of home ownership lead to a high rate of unemployment (in the 1997 Journal of Economic Perspectives) and that oil price shocks are a key driver of movements in unemployment (in the 1998 Review of Economics and Statistics)."]}, {"page": "Blanchflower", "response": ["*David Blanchflower (born 1952), a British-American labour economist"]}, {"page": "Varndean College", "response": ["* David Blanchflower CBE, economist"]}, {"page": "List of University of Birmingham alumni", "response": ["* David Blanchflower, labour economist"]}]}}
