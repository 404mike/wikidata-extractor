He is the 19th Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and has held this position since 1 July 2015.\nHe was previously Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, and has held a Royal Society Research Professorship since 2007.His work focuses on the theory of soft matter, such as polymers, colloids, gels, liquid crystals, and granular material. A recurring goal of his research is to create a mathematical model that predicts the stress in a flowing material as a functional of the flow history of that material. Such a mathematical model is called a constitutive equation. He has worked on theories of active matter, particularly dense suspensions of self-propelled particles which can include motile bacteria. His interests also include fundamental field theories of active systems in which time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry, and more generally, CPT symmetry) is absent. Such theories are characterised by nonzero steady-state entropy production.\nAt Edinburgh, Cates was the Principal Investigator of an EPSRC Programme Grant, awarded in 2011, entitled Design Principles for New Soft Materials. On his departure for Cambridge, Cait MacPhee took over as Principal Investigator. Cates remains an Honorary Professor at Edinburgh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lucasian Professor of Mathematics", "response": ["The current and 19th Lucasian Professor is Michael Cates, starting from 1 July 2015.", "| Michael Cates(born 1961)"]}, {"page": "Dirac Medal", "response": ["* 2009: Michael Cates (University of Edinburgh)  For pioneering work in the theoretical physics of soft materials, particularly in relation to their flow behaviour."]}, {"page": "ESPCI Paris", "response": ["*Prof. Michael Cates, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge "]}, {"page": "Michael Green (physicist)", "response": ["Following his PhD, Green did postdoctoral research at Princeton University (1970\u201372), Cambridge and the University of Oxford.

Everyday examples include beans getting stuck in a hopper in a whole food shop,  or milk powder getting jammed in an upside-down bottle.  The term was coined by physicist Michael Cates, who asserts that such circumstances warrant a new class of materials.  The jamming thus described can be unjammed by mechanical means, such as tapping or shaking the container, or poking it with a stick."]}, {"page": "Cates", "response": ["*Michael Cates, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University"]}, {"page": "Rainbow Kiss", "response": ["The play began previews for a limited run in New York at 59E59 Theaters on 12 March 2008 with a press opening scheduled for 22 March 2008.
