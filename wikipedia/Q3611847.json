As an employee at Epstein's company NEMS, Taylor accompanied him when he first saw the Beatles perform, at the Cavern Club in Liverpool on 9 November 1961. Taylor subsequently worked as the group's so-called \"Mr. Fixit\", devising escape routes from crazed fans and assisting the band members in purchasing property. He later became general manager of Apple Corps but was fired soon after Allen Klein arrived to address the company's financial problems. Taylor published various memoirs of his years in the Beatles' employ, including Yesterday: The Beatles Remembered and With the Beatles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Epstein", "response": ["Epstein first noticed the Beatles in issues of Mersey Beat and on numerous posters around Liverpool created by his commercial artist associate Tony Booth, before he asked Mersey Beat editor Bill Harry who they were. Harry had previously convinced Epstein to sell the magazine at NEMS, with the Beatles featured on the front page of its second issue. The Beatles had recorded the \"My Bonnie\" single with Tony Sheridan in Germany, and some months after its release Epstein asked his personal assistant Alistair Taylor about it in NEMS. Epstein's version of the story was that customer Raymond Jones walked into the NEMS shop and asked him for the \"My Bonnie\" single, which made Epstein curious about the group. Taylor later claimed that he had used the name of Jones (a regular customer) to order the single and paid the deposit, knowing that Epstein would notice it and order further copies. Harry and McCartney later repudiated Epstein's story, as Harry had been talking to Epstein for a long time about the Beatles\u2014the group that he promoted the most in Mersey Beat\u2014with McCartney saying, \"Brian knew perfectly well who the Beatles were; they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat\". On 3 August 1961, Epstein started a regular music column in the Mersey Beat called \"Stop the World\u2014And Listen To Everything in It: Brian Epstein of NEMS\"."]}, {"page": "Mal Evans", "response": ["Epstein's associate, Alistair Taylor, once asked him why he was driving an Austin Princess limousine, rather than a Daimler, a Bentley, or a Rolls-Royce. Evans explained that the Beatles were forced to choose an Austin, because they had tested every car to see how wide the doors would open as they (literally) had to \"dive into the car\" to escape their fans."]}, {"page": "Magic Alex", "response": ["The Beatles had tried in 1964 to buy the  Trinity Island, (Greek: \u0391\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1), off the coast of the Greek island of Euboea (pronounced EV-i-a) (resembling a guitar in shape) but the owners were not interested in a sale. Lennon was still interested in buying or leasing an island to live on together, and discussed it with the other Beatles on 19 July 1967. Mardas' father was a major in the Greek secret police, and Mardas explained that through him the Beatles would have access to Greek government connections, which would speed the acquisition of an island, because many islands did have the right certificates of ownership and were subject to government restrictions. On 22 July 1967, Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd, Ringo Starr and Neil Aspinall flew to Athens, where they stayed in Mardas' parents' house overnight, until Lennon, along with Cynthia Lennon and their son Julian Lennon, McCartney and Jane Asher, Pattie Boyd's 16-year-old sister Paula, Mal Evans and Alistair Taylor set off for Athens.", "Their chartered yacht, the MV Arvi, was detained in Crete because of bad weather, so the party had to wait in Athens for three days. Taylor complained that on a trip to a small hill village, \"We came round a corner of the peaceful road only to find hundreds of photographers clicking away at us\", which Mardas had organised. McCartney later said that while sailing around Greek islands, everybody just sat around and took LSD.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 6 - 1:06:18) Harrison talking about the trip to Greece to buy an island. They eventually found what is referred to as the  island of Leslo (although no Greek island is officially known by this name). The island had a small fishing village, four beaches, and a large olive grove. Four small neighbouring islands surrounded it (one for each Beatle). The Beatles sent Alistair Taylor back to London to handle the purchase of the island. Taylor received permission from the Greek government to purchase the island, and \u00a390,000 of special \"export dollars\" required for the transaction were purchased. However, the Beatles changed their minds before the deal went through, and the export dollars were sold for a \u00a311,400 profit a few months later when exchange rates went up (one of the few profitable business ventures for the Beatles).\"The Beatles visit a Greek island they intended to purchase\", The Beatles Bible.

His idea was to plough their money into a chain of shops not unlike Woolworth's in concept: Apple boutiques, Apple posters, Apple records. Brian needed an outlet for his boundless energy\".

It was during this period that Taylor appeared in the famous advertisement to promote Apple asking for new artists. Designed by McCartney, it showed him disguised as a one-man band, claiming: \"This man has talent...\" The publication in the New Musical Express and Rolling Stone brought an avalanche of applicants. The mail room, telephone switchboard, and conference rooms became jammed at all hours with \"artists\" begging the Beatles to give them money. George Harrison would later lament that \"We had every freak in the world coming in there\". Many of these supplicants received the investments they sought and were never heard from again."]}, {"page": "Hello, Goodbye", "response": ["McCartney later said that the lyrics take duality as their theme. The song originated when, in response to a question from Beatles aide Alistair Taylor about songwriting, McCartney sat down at a harmonium and asked Taylor to say the opposite of whatever he said. The completed song includes a musical coda, which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967. Unimpressed with the composition, Lennon pushed for \"I Am the Walrus\" to be the single's A-side, before reluctantly accepting that \"Hello, Goodbye\" was the more commercial-sounding of the two sides. The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song, one of which was shown on The Ed Sullivan Show in America. Due to the regulations against lip-syncing on British television, none of the clips were aired there.", "Although \"Hello, Goodbye\" is credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney, the song was written solely by Paul McCartney. The composition came about through an exercise in word association between McCartney and Alistair Taylor, an assistant of the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. It originated during a period when, following the completion of their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in April 1967, the Beatles typically embraced randomness and simplicity as part of the creative process."]}, {"page": "Allen Klein", "response": ["With the possible exception of Alexis Mardas, who occupied a far less central role, nobody in the Beatles' milieu has received a more damning verdict from historians than Allen Klein. He was, one said, \"a tough little scorpion\"; for another, \"fast-talking, dirty-mouthed \u2026 sloppily dressed and grossly overweight\"; again, \"short and fat, beady-eyed and greasily pompadoured\". Beatles aide Alistair Taylor said, \"He had all the charm of a broken lavatory seat\" ... So consistent was the vilification that when biographer Philip Norman merely described Klein as \"a tubby little man\", it sounded like a compliment."]}, {"page": "Revolution 9", "response": ["During compilation and sequencing of the master tape for the album The Beatles, two unrelated segments were included between the previous song (\"Cry Baby Cry\") and \"Revolution 9\". The first was a fragment of a song based on the line \"Can you take me back\", an improvisation sung by McCartney that was recorded between takes of \"I Will\". The second was a bit of conversation from the studio control room where Alistair Taylor asked Martin for forgiveness for not bringing him a bottle of claret, and then calling him a \"cheeky bitch\".", "*Alistair Taylor \u2013 spoken vocals"]}, {"page": "The Fool on the Hill", "response": ["Alistair Taylor, in his book Yesterday, reports a mysterious incident involving a man who inexplicably appeared near him and McCartney during a walk on Primrose Hill and then disappeared again, soon after McCartney and Taylor had conversed about the existence of God. In Taylor's account, this incident prompted McCartney to write \"The Fool on the Hill\".", "According to Alistair Taylor, McCartney \"disappeared\" in late October and it was only on his return that the others learned that he had been to France to film a sequence for \"The Fool on the Hill\". McCartney flew to Nice with cameraman Aubrey Dewar and filmed the sequence at dawn on 31 October. The location was in the mountains inland from the city. McCartney mimed to the song as Dewar filmed the sunrise. The clip was the only musical segment filmed at an exterior location and using professional photography, and the shoot took place when the rest of the Magical Mystery Tour footage was well into the editing stage. Peter Brown, who was coordinating the Beatles' business affairs following Epstein's death, recalled that McCartney phoned him from Nice asking for new camera lenses to be sent out for the shoot. According to Brown, the cost for the location filming was considerable, at \u00a34000. In Taylor's description, the footage was \"terrific\" and \"really complemented the song\".
