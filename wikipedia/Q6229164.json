It was therefore on the deck of Elephant that the legend of Nelson putting the telescope to his blind eye arose. The postcard of the monument to George Parsons in St Leonard's, Bursledon dates from around 1930 and is believed to have been annotated by his great-great-grandson John Denham Parsons who was a regular visitor to the village and local historian before the II World War. He gives Elephants dimensions as Gun Deck 168\u00a0ft, Length of Keel 139\u00a0ft 10in, breadth 47\u00a0ft, depth 19\u00a0ft 9in and tonnage 1617. Gunnery is given as 28 guns of  tons each of 6-inch bore on the lower deck, 28 guns of 5 bore on the main deck and 18 9 pounders with a 4 bore on the poop with carronades as well. Two thousand oak trees are said to have been used in the construction.

Some localities (such as England) included polemics against using the cross in worship. For example, during the 16th century, theologians in the Anglican and Reformed traditions Nicholas Ridley,Nicholas Ridley, A Treatise on the Worship of Images, written before 1555. James Calfhill,James Calfhill, An aunsvvere to the Treatise of the crosse (An answer to John Martiall's Treatise of the cross) at 1565. and Theodore Beza,Theodore Beza, in his Answer to the Colloquium of Montheliard at 1588, according to Jaroslav Pelikan, The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine, Vol. 4, University of Chicago Press 1985, p. 217. rejected practices that they described as cross worship. Considering it a form of idolatry, there was a dispute in 16th century England over the baptismal use of the sign of the cross and even the public use of crosses.Peter Blickle, Macht und Ohnmacht der Bilder.: Reformatorischer Bildersturm im Kontext der europ\u00e4ischen Geschichte, Oldenbourg Verlag, 2002, pp. 253-272. There were more active reactions to religious items that were thought as 'relics of Papacy', as happened for example in September 1641, when Sir Robert Harley pulled down and destroyed the cross at Wigmore.Religious Politics in Post-Reformation England: Essays in Honour of Nicholas Tyacke, Boydell & Brewer, 2006, p. 26. Writers during the 19th century indicating a Pagan origin of the cross included Henry Dana Ward,Henry Dana Ward, History of the cross, the pagan origin, and idolatrous adoption and worship of the image, at 1871. Mourant Brock,Mourant Brock, The cross, heathen and Christian: A fragmentary notice of its early pagan existence and subsequent Christian adoption, London 1879. and John Denham Parsons.John Denham Parsons, The non-Christian cross; an enquiry into the origin and history of the symbol eventually adopted as that of our religion, at 1896. David Williams, writing of medieval images of monsters, says: \"The disembodied phallus is also formed into a cross, which, before it became for Christianity the symbol of salvation, was a pagan symbol of fertility.\"David Williams, Deformed Discourse: The function of the Monster in Mediaeval thought and literature, McGill-Queen's Press 1999, p. 161. The study, Gods, Heroes & Kings: The Battle for Mythic Britain states: \"Before the fourth century CE, the cross was not widely embraced as a sign of Christianity, symbolizing as it did the gallows of a criminal.\"Christopher R. Fee & David Adams Leeming, Gods, Heroes & Kings: The battle for mythic Britain, Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 113. This reaction in the Anglican and other Reformed Churches was short-lived and the cross became ubiquitous in these Christian traditions."]}]}}
