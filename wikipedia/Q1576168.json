The composers attempted to compose music that felt accessible to players, avoiding an exclusive focus on swing or jazz. Andrew Hale felt that composing the game's score was a flexible process \"about setting a mood\", as opposed to a \"mechanical\" process in which the music was specifically composed to fit with the time frames of the game. In addition to the original score and licensed tracks, the game also features original vocal recordings in order to create an authentic sound to suit the musical identity of the period. The game also contains licensed music tracks provided by the in-game radio from artists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, and Billie Holiday.
