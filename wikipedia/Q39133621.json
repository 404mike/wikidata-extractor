He was born and died in London.\nWilson was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a successful schoolboy cricketer, playing in the Eton v Harrow match at Lord's in both 1899 and 1900, and in the second of these matches he scored 79 and 24 as a middle-order right-handed batsman and took four Etonian wickets with his right-arm slow bowling. At Cambridge, he bowled very little and won a Blue by playing as a reliable batsman in the University Match against Oxford University for three seasons from 1902 to 1904, having failed even to have a trial match in 1901. He captained the Cambridge side in 1904 and was criticised for delaying the second innings declaration so that Frederick Marsh could break the University Match record for the highest individual score, the match ending in a draw. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote that the delay \"was clearly a mistake\" and that \"the chance of winning the match should have outweighed all considerations of personal distinction\", though it added that rain and missed catches also contributed to Cambridge's failure to win.Wilson was an all-round sportsman at Cambridge, winning blues for lawn tennis and rackets, and the obituary for him in The Times in 1932 stated that he had seen rackets as his principal sport, though he was unable to continue as a player because of indifferent health. After leaving Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree, he played in only one further first-class cricket match, a game for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1906.Wilson became a schoolmaster at Rossall School in Lancashire, but did not take to the profession and became instead a sporting journalist, reporting on cricket, rackets and tennis principally, before the First World War, for the Daily Mirror, where he developed a distinctive \"light\" conversational style of reportage which was very popular. On the outbreak of war, he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, later being commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers and being wounded in service. After the war, most of his journalism was for The Times and more serious in tone, and he claimed to have reported on more than 20 different sports.Wilson's son, Peter Wilson, followed him into sports journalism and was sports editor of the Daily Mirror in the 1950s and 1960s, known as \"The Man They Can't Gag\" for his forthright opinions; Peter Wilson's own son, Julian Wilson, was the horse-racing correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Frederic Wilson (1881\u20131932), English first-class cricketerHarrow, 1800\u20131911, p. 767"]}, {"page": "Fred Wilson", "response": ["* Frederic Wilson (1881\u20131932), English sportsman and journalist known sometimes as Fred Wilson"]}, {"page": "Julian Wilson (commentator)", "response": ["Julian David Bonhote Wilson (21 June 1940 \u2013 20 April 2014)  was BBC Television's horse racing correspondent from 1966 until his retirement in 1997.

As a cricketer he was a right-handed opening batsman and he had made his debut for Oxfordshire County Cricket Club in minor matches in 1892, playing regularly in the county's Minor Counties matches from 1897. He was described in his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as \"a batsman with a dogged defence and no pretensions to style\". He was 25 years old before he went to Cambridge University and played in the freshmen's trial match in 1901, scoring 98 in the second innings, but then failed to be selected for any games except trial matches at Cambridge for the next three seasons. In 1904, however, having made a century in a trial match for the university side, Marsh finally made his first-class debut and in his third game, the match against the London County Cricket Club, W. G. Grace's team, he scored 118 in the second innings. That led to his selection for the 1904 University Match against Oxford University, where he proved to be a successful but controversial player. In the second Cambridge innings, Marsh made an unbeaten 172, the highest score in the history of the University Match, beating by one run the 171 made by Tip Foster in 1900. The decision by Cambridge captain Frederic Wilson to delay the second innings declaration to enable Marsh to beat the record was widely criticised as the match then ended in a draw. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote that the delay \"was clearly a mistake\" and that \"the chance of winning the match should have outweighed all considerations of personal distinction\", though it added that rain and missed catches had also contributed to Cambridge's failure to win."]}, {"page": "Frederick Wilson", "response": ["* Frederic Wilson (1881\u20131932), English sportsman and journalist"]}]}}
