These pioneering women, appeared in a feature in Newsweek, July 1969, \"The Girls: Letting Go: 'What is common to them \u2013 to Joni Mitchell and Lotti Golden, to Laura Nyro, Melanie, and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalised songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery, brimming with keen observation and startling in the impact of their poetry.\" In The Guardian, author Laura Barton describes the radical shift in subject matter\u2014they sang about politics, love affairs, the urban landscape, drugs, disappointment, and the life and loneliness of the itinerant performer. Lotti Golden, in her Atlantic debut album Motor-Cycle, chronicled her life in NYC's East Village in the late 1960s counterculture, visiting subjects such as gender identity (The Space Queens-Silky is Sad) and excessive drug use (Gonna Fay's). The women in the 1969 Newsweek article ushered in a new age of the contemporary female singer-songwriter that has informed generations of women singer-songwriters into the 21st century, with poet Warsan Shire as the muse for Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 album Lemonade."]}, {"page": "Music of New York City", "response": ["The performers associated with the Greenwich Village scene, many of whom were not originally from New York, had sporadic mainstream success in the 1940s and 1950s; some, such as Pete Seeger and the Almanac Trio, did well, but most were confined to local coffeehouses and other venues. Performers such as Dave Van Ronk and Joan Baez helped expand the scene by appealing to college students. In the early 1960s, Baez was instrumental in introducing the up-and-coming young folk artist Bob Dylan to her audience and he quickly achieved national prominence. By the mid-1960s, folk and rock were merging, with Bob Dylan taking the lead in July 1965, releasing \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" with a revolutionary rock sound for its time, steeped in tawdry New York imagery, followed by an electric performance in late July at the Newport Folk Festival. Dylan plugged an entire generation into the milieu of the singer-songwriter, often writing from an urban, New York point of view. By the mid-to-late 1960s, bands and singer/songwriters began to proliferate the underground New York art and music scene. The release of The Velvet Underground & Nico in 1967, featuring singer-songrwriter Lou Reed and collaborator Nico, was described as the \"most prophetic rock album ever made\" by Rolling Stone in 2003. New York in the mid-to-late 1960s gave birth to the contemporary singer/songwriter, with the urban landscape as a canvass for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath. In July 1969, Newsweek magazine's feature story, \"The Girls-Letting Go,\" described the groundbreaking music of Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro, Lotti Golden, and Melanie as a new breed of female troubadour: \"What is common to them are the personalized songs they write, like voyages of self discovery, startling in the impact of their poetry.\" The work of these early New York-based singer/songwriters, from Laura Nyro's insightful New York Tendaberry, released in 1969, to Lotti Golden's adventurous East Village, Manhattan, diaries on Motor-Cycle, her 1969 debut on Atlantic Records, has served as inspiration to generations of female singer/songwriters in the rock, folk, and jazz traditions. The Guardian in January 2017 paid homage to the female singer/songwriters featured in Newsweek's July 1969 article, in a piece by Laura Barton: \"Newsweek published an article under the headline 'The Girls \u2013 Letting Go,' charting the burgeoning careers of a group of young musicians it termed 'a new school of talented female troubadours.' They sang about politics, love affairs, the urban landscape, drugs, disappointment, and the life and loneliness of the itinerant performers, subjects that, hitherto, had largely been the preserve of male musicians.\" New York would see a revived interest in folk and singer/songwriters in the 1980s and 1990s led by artists like Suzanne Vega.

In July 2005, users fiercely debated the meanings of the lyrics to Coldplay's song, \"Speed of Sound\". The News & Observer called SongMeaning's discussions on the meaning to the lyrics of 50 Cent's \"Wanksta\" particularly \"illuminating\". Attention was brought to SongMeanings in July 2007 when it was used to discuss what Tyondai Braxton meant in his underground song \"Atlas\".  However, one of the most hotly debated songs is the Eagles' \"Hotel California\" with thousands of users weighing in on the true meaning of the song; leading theories include addiction and a secret message from a satanic cult. Writing for British newspaper The Guardian, Laura Barton discussed SongMeanings in an article focusing on the problem of mishearing lyrics in a song, the inability to determine what the lyrics are due to a lack of sleevenotes when downloading songs, and whether or not it is even essential to know the lyrics in order to understand a song. From the website, she chose the discussion on The Beatles's song, \"I Am the Walrus\", as an example, due to its cryptic lyrics. Barton quoted one of the comments from the website, which considered the song as a \"philosophy of life\", and that it was a song that was a prime example of one that \"threw into disarray the import placed upon lyrics\". She then rebutted this by choosing Elton John's \"Your Song\" as a better example of this."]}, {"page": "Tobi Lark", "response": ["Newspaper columnist Laura Barton, of The Guardian, has compared the record to a Shakespeare sonnet:\"It...is simply a song about seeing the preciousness of life, about trying to live our lives better and brighter. Its verses cut a melancholy figure, its opening lines reflecting on the steady turn of the world: \"Passing seasons ever fade away/ Into misty clouds of autumn grey/ As I sit here looking at the street/ Little figures, quickly moving feet.\" And then in zaps the chorus, a remonstration of sorts, or a call to arms: \"Life is just a precious minute baby,\" it yells. \"Open up your eyes and see it baby/ Give yourself a better chance/ Because time will pass you/ Right on by.\"  Like many pop songs, there's something of the sonnet about Time Will Pass You By; it's there in the song's intention of course, but there is something about Legend's track that has always reminded me specifically of Shakespeare's Sonnet 60. Legend's second verse, \"I'm just a pebble on the beach and I sit and wonder why/ Little people running around/ Never knowing why,\" for example, seems to echo Shakespeare's lines: \"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore/ So do our minutes hasten to their end;/ Each changing place with that which goes before,/ In sequent toil all forwards do contend.\"\""]}, {"page": "Nancy Elizabeth", "response": ["The second album Wrought Iron was released on 5 October 2009, again with The Leaf Label.

Drawing inspiration from natural sounds of the Faroe Islands (her grandmother's birthplace), rural Spain and the Lake District, the album was recorded in a remote corner of North Wales. Described as a \"sparse album, dusted with piano, breathy vocals and harmonies, and touches of acoustic guitar, horns and accordion\" this work moves away from the multi-instrumental previous works to concentrate mainly on the piano, guitar and vocal arrangements. Track 4 of the album was released as a single with an accompanying video, shot in Portishead lido."]}, {"page": "Riot grrrl", "response": ["*Grrrl power by Laura Barton"]}]}}
