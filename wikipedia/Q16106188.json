Robinson claimed that he only weighed 158\u00a0lbs. for his fight with Ali (not 178 as was officially listed). He also stated that he was good friends with Ali and would drive him around in Ali's pink Cadillac. He last saw Ali in 1967. Since this interview, Robinson's whereabouts have been unknown. In 2009, ESPN sports writer Wright Thompson wrote an article about his six-year attempt to find Robinson in the Overtown district of Miami with no success. Ali collector Stephen Singer has spent a number of years searching for Robinson, collecting autographs of 49 of Ali's 50 opponents, with Robinson being the lone omission."]}]}}
