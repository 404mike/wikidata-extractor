He was eventually made an assistant to William Lambton on the Great Trigonometric Survey, and replaced Lambton as superintendent of the survey in 1823. Everest was largely responsible for surveying the meridian arc from the southernmost point of India north to Nepal, a distance of about 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi), a task which took from 1806 to 1841 to complete. He was made Surveyor General of India in 1830, retiring in 1843 and returning to England.\nIn 1865, the Royal Geographical Society renamed Peak XV \u2013 at the time only recently identified as the world's highest peak \u2013 to Mount Everest in his honour. Andrew Scott Waugh, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and successor as surveyor general, had been responsible for putting his name forward in 1856.

While in India, Pratt was approached by Andrew Scott Waugh, Surveyor General of India who had succeeded George Everest, to examine the gravitational anomaly caused by the Himalayas on the plumbline which resulted in errors in the Great Trigonometrical Survey. Pratt estimated the deviation of the plumbline that would be expected by the mass of the mountains (based on density estimated in 1772 at Mount Schiehallion in Scotland) but the observed deviations were much less. He propounded a theory that the density of the mountains was less than that of the underlying substrate. It was also noticed that the deviations of the plumbline were greater at the foot of the mountain and reduced as one moved away from the mountain. George Airy came up with the explanation that the roots of the mountain go deep into the earth. He compared it with a heap of logs in water and suggested that when a log juts higher above the water, a greater amount of it must be submerged. Pratt on the other hand suggested that there was a lower density under mountains below sea-level (actually refined later and termed the depth of compensation) and that this is offset by the mass above sea-level. Pratt's explanation assumes a variation in density whereas Airy assumes a constant crustal density. Pratt found fault with Airy's idea as it assumed a thinner crust (10 miles) than that estimated by William Hopkins (800 to 1000 miles) and also that the crust is lighter. Pratt said that the crust cools from the solid interior and should therefore be denser. Airy did not defend his view but Samuel Haughton used the debate to claim that mathematics was a useless tool for speculation. Pratt suggested that the crust would be depressed in the cooler parts of the world and suggested that the plumb deflection was caused by anomalous high density in the oceans south of the Himalayas. Pratt also applied his knowledge of physics and mathematics to a number of applications in India on which he was consulted by engineers.
