A veteran of many Pacific crossings, he is probably best known for his work Voyages in the Northern Pacific; Narrative of Several Trading Voyages from 1813 to 1818... He also gained a note of notoriety from his 1818 exploits as captain of the Argentinian sailing vessel Santa Rosa while in the employ of French privateer Hippolyte de Bouchard.\nCorney died on 31 August 1835 in the company of his family while traversing the English Channel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mission San Juan Capistrano", "response": ["On December 14, 1818, the French privateer Hip\u00f3lito Bouchard, sailing under the flag of the \"United Provinces of Rio de la Plata\" (Argentina), brought his ships La Argentina and Santa Rosa to within sight of the Mission; aware that Bouchard (today known as \"California's only pirate\") had recently conducted raids on the settlements at Monterey and Santa Barbara, Comandante Ru\u00edz had sent forth a party of thirty men (under the leadership of a young Spanish lieutenant named Santiago Arg\u00fcello) to protect the Mission at first news of the approach on the 13th.Bancroft, vol. ii, p. 240 Two members of Bouchard's contingent made contact with the garrison soldiers and made their demand for provisions, which was rebuffed with added threats: Lieutenant Arg\u00fcello replied that if the ships did not sail away the garrison would gladly provide \"an immediate supply of shot and shell\".Stern and Miller, p. 50; Yenne, p. 77 In response, \"Pirata Buchar\" (as he was referred to by the Californios) ordered an assault on the Mission, sending some 140 men and two or three violentos (light howitzer cannon) to take the needed supplies by force.Jones p. 170 The Mission guards engaged the attackers but were overwhelmed; the marauders looted the Mission warehouses and left minor damage to several Mission buildings in their wake, and reportedly set fire to a few of the outlying straw houses.Bancroft, vol. ii, p. 241; Miller and Stern, p. 50: Sir Peter Corney, commander of the Santa Rosa, later reported that, \"We found the town well-stocked with everything but money, and destroyed much wine and spirits and all the public property, set fire to the King's stores, barracks, and governor's house, and about two o'clock we marched back though not in the order that we went, many of the men being intoxicated.\" Reinforcements from Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, led by Comandante Guerra from El Presidio Real de Santa B\u00e1rbara, arrived the next day to no avail as the ships had already set sail. "]}, {"page": "Hippolyte Bouchard", "response": ["However, because of the strong winds it was possible to send only an officer and eight sailors to sail the vessel. The schooner was in sight until 15 April, possibly the insubordination was caused by the value of the shipment. La Argentina traveled to the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii) to find new crew members to replace those who had died from scurvy. Bouchard hired Peter Corney to captain the Santa Rosa, a captured ship whose crew had mutinied. Filomeno V. Aguilar Jr. in his paper: \u201cManilamen and seafaring: engaging the maritime world beyond the Spanish realm\u201d, stated that his second ship, the Santa Rosa had a multi-ethnic crew which included Filipinos.Delgado de Cant\u00fa, Gloria M. (2006). Historia de M\u00e9xico. M\u00e9xico, D. F.: Pearson Educaci\u00f3n. Mercene, writer of the Book \u201cManila Men\u201d, proposes that those Manilamen were recruited in San Blas, an alternative port to Acapulco Mexico where several Filipinos had settled during the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade era. The Filipinos who settled in San Blas were escapees from Spanish slavery in the Manila Galleons, upon meeting Hippolyte Bouchard who worked for the Argentinians that revolted against Spain, the common grievance the Filipinos shared against the Spaniards, which they shared with the Argentines caused them to mutiny and join the rebel Argentines.Mercene, Manila men, p. 52.", "He also recruited Peter Corney, who put in charge of the corvette Santa Rosa.", "Bouchard met with his officers to design the attack plan. Peter Corney knew the bay from two previous visits to Monterey. They used the corvette Santa Rosa to attack since the deep draft frigate La Argentina might run aground. The frigate had to be towed by small boats and out of range of the Spanish artillery. Once it was out of range, Bouchard sent captain Sheppard to the Santa Rosa, leading two hundred soldiers, carrying firearms and lances."]}, {"page": "Corney (surname)", "response": ["* Peter Corney (died 1835), English sailor and explorer"]}, {"page": "Corney, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Corney"]}]}}
