Oliver Heywood estimated the number of ministers ejected at 2,500. This group included Richard Baxter, Edmund Calamy the Elder, Simeon Ashe, Thomas Case, John Flavel, William Jenkyn, Joseph Caryl, Thomas Brooks, Thomas Manton, William Sclater, Thomas Doolittle and Thomas Watson.

Afterwards he became a member of Broadgates Hall, whence he took his degrees in arts, proceeding MA in 1617. He was ordained, and held a living at Sampford Peverell in Devon. According to Thomas Crosby in his History of the English General Baptists, he was strongly in favour of ceremonies in Archbishop William Laud's time, and was afterwards taunted by his presbyterian opponents for his zeal in this direction. Wood, however in his Athenae Oxonienses, says that he was always a puritan at heart, and it appears that in 1639 he was convened by Joseph Hall, Bishop of Exeter, for preaching that the Church of England did not hold episcopacy to be jure divino, but according to Thomas Brooks made \"a handsome retractation\". Although a puritan and an enemy to episcopacy, Cox in his earlier days may have upheld the sacramental system as warmly as many other presbyterians did. After the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, he ventured to express opinions that he had thought it prudent to conceal up to that time."]}]}}
