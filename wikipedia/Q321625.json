Recording and mixing the new album took almost two years and spread across Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S; at various times, Tom Dowd, Jimmy Miller, and John Porter were attached as producers.  Some seasoned performers, ex-Dexys members, and session musicians made up the rest of the band, including Vincent Crane (ex-Atomic Rooster) on piano, Julian Littman on mandolin, Tim Dancy (who had been Al Green's drummer) on drums, Tommy Evans on steel guitar, and former Dexys members \"Big\" Jim Paterson on trombone, Robert Noble on organ and synthesizer, and John \"Rhino\" Edwards on bass.

The band included Vincent Crane (Hammond organ and piano), Drachen Theaker (drums), and Nick Greenwood (bass). Brown quickly earned a reputation for outlandish performances, which included the use of a burning metal helmet, that led to occasional mishaps, such as during an early appearance at the Windsor Festival in 1967, where he wore a colander on his head soaked in methanol. The fuel poured over his head by accident caught fire; a bystander doused the flames by pouring beer on Brown's head, preventing any serious injury.Marshall 2005, pp. 61\u201362. The flaming head then became an Arthur Brown signature. On occasion he also stripped naked while performing, most notably at the Palermo Pop 70 Festival in Sicily, Italy, July 1970, where he was arrested and deported.Marshall 2005, pp. 94\u2013101. He was also notable for the extreme make-up he wore onstage, which would later be reflected in the stage acts of Alice Cooper and Kiss. He was also famed for his powerful operatic voice and his high pitched screams.", "By 1968, the debut album, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Produced by the Who's manager Kit Lambert, and executive-produced by Pete Townshend on Track Records, the label begun by Lambert and Chris Stamp, it spun off an equally surprising hit single, \"Fire\", and contained a version of \"I Put a Spell on You\" by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, a similarly bizarre showman. \"Fire\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The song has since seen its opening line \"I am the God of Hellfire\" sampled in numerous other places, most notably in the Prodigy's 1992 rave anthem \"Fire\". The band recorded a second album, titled Strangelands, intended for release in 1969 but shelved by their label over concerns that it lacked sales potential. The album featured a more experimental and avant-garde sound that shed the pop sensibilities of the Crazy World's debut. Strangelands was not issued until 1988. Theaker was replaced because of his aviophobia in 1968 by drummer Carl Palmer, later of Atomic Rooster and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, for the band's second American tour in 1969, on which keyboardist Vincent Crane also left \u2013 although he soon returned.

With his first solo album Gallagher continued in the eclectic style that had exemplified his first band, Taste. The album begins with \"Laundromat\" which was to become a regular number in his live set. A blues rock song with a classic Gallagher riff, the song was inspired by the public laundromat located in the basement of his flat where he lived at the time in Earls Court.  The next song, \"Just the Smile\", is an acoustic number that was inspired by the British folk revival. It shows the influence of some of Gallagher's favorite English folk musicians such as Richard Thompson, Davy Graham, and Scottish guitarist Bert Jansch. (Gallagher would later go on to record with Jansch.) \"I Fall Apart\" has a jazz feel to it and features a guitar solo that starts slow and introspective and builds to a powerful climax. The next two songs, \"Hands Up\" and \"Sinner Boy\", were again blues rock and would also become standard numbers for his live show. \"Wave Myself Goodbye\" is another acoustic number, a talking blues song featuring New Orleans style piano provided by Vincent Crane from the band Atomic Rooster (Rory's brother Donal had been acting as tour manager for them). Gallagher plays saxophone in the next song, a jazz number called \"Can't Believe It's True\". Also recorded at the time were two blues classics, Muddy Waters' \"Gypsy Woman\" and \"It Takes Time\" by Chicago blues legend Otis Rush. Muddy Waters was a teenage hero for Gallagher; they ultimately collaborated on Muddy Waters' album The London Muddy Waters Sessions.
