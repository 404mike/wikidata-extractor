The event saw her earn the nickname \"Queen of the Palace\" from the name of the venue, the Alexandra Palace.During the 2021 Grand Slam of Darts, Sherrock became the first woman to reach the last 16 of a major darts tournament, after she beat Gabriel Clemens 5\u20133 in her final group stage match.

Jacklin cited the failure to secure a sponsor for the event, and the fact that only 15% of tickets had been sold. The reduction in the prize fund and the failure to confirm the reduced amounts that players would receive was criticised by a number of players. In protest at the reduced prize money on offer, Fallon Sherrock, runner-up in the 2015 women's event, confirmed that she would be withdrawing from the competition. Ultimately, champion Wayne Warren received \u00a323,000, a 77% reduction on the previous year's prize money and the lowest amount received by a winner of the tournament since 1989.
