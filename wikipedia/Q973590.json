Frusciante wanted an album of two different types of songs: songs that were more \"English-sounding\" and melodic, and songs that were more influenced by punk rock. Frusciante's punk inspiration came from listening to music by The Damned and Discharge, among others.RHCP, Mullen 2010. p. 210 Rick Rubin was not familiar with the latter bands and sound and thought that the melodic songs were original and more exciting, causing the band to focus mostly on the melodic material. However, one punk rock-influenced song was recorded during these sessions, \"Body of Water,\" but did not make the final cut and was instead included on \"The Zephyr Song\" single. Many of the more melodic inspired songs came from Frusciante listening to The Beach Boys and The Beatles, along with doo-wop groups and their harmonies. Frusciante said he listened to Emerson, Lake & Palmer every day during the recording of By the Way. These new styles as well as Frusciante being especially prolific during this era came to alienate bassist Flea, who had wanted the band to return to its earlier funk-influenced sound.

According to Kiedis, Flea felt his voice wasn't being heard, and there was a point where he considered leaving the band.
