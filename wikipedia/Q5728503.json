As a relative and very close friend of the Royal Family, he held the office of Master of the Horse for 42 years (1936\u20131978), the longest to hold the position. He founded the Badminton Horse Trials and was deemed \"the greatest fox-hunter of the twentieth century\"; his long tenure as Master of the Beaufort Hunt led to his being universally nicknamed Master and his car bore the private numberplate MFH1. In 1980 he published the authoritative book \"Fox-Hunting\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
