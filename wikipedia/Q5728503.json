As a relative and very close friend of the Royal Family, he held the office of Master of the Horse for 42 years (1936\u20131978), the longest to hold the position. He founded the Badminton Horse Trials and was deemed \"the greatest fox-hunter of the twentieth century\"; his long tenure as Master of the Beaufort Hunt led to his being universally nicknamed Master and his car bore the private numberplate MFH1. In 1980 he published the authoritative book Fox-Hunting.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Bristol", "response": ["The 1960s were a time of considerable student activism in the United Kingdom, and Bristol was no exception. In 1968, many students marched in support of the Anderson Report, which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in at the Senate House (the administrative headquarters of the university). A series of chancellors and vice-chancellors led the university through these decades, with Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort taking over from Churchill as chancellor in 1965 before being succeeded by Dorothy Hodgkin in 1970 who spent the next 18 years in the office."]}, {"page": "Kensington Palace", "response": ["Kensington Palace was severely damaged during The Blitz of 1940 when it was hit by an incendiary bomb that exploded in the north side of Clock Court, damaging many of the surrounding buildings including the State Apartments, particularly the Queen's Apartments. The Headquarters of Personnel Section occupied Apartment 34, and as a result the garden was overrun with anti-aircraft guns, sandbags and trenches.  Repairs to the palace were not completed for several years, but after the war, Prince Philip stayed with his grandmother in the lead-up to his 1947 marriage with Princess Elizabeth, later to become Queen Elizabeth II.  With the bombing damage and the deaths of Princess Louise and Princess Beatrice, the palace entered a period of neglect. During the 1950s, residents of the palace included Master of the Horse, Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort who had married Lady Victoria Cambridge (a niece of Queen Mary as the daughter of the 1st Marquess of Cambridge), Sir Alan Lascelles, Queen Elizabeth's private secretary and Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone who lived in the palace until her death in 1981. In 1955, the widowed Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent moved into Apartment 1, with her children, which had been vacant since Princess Louise's death in 1939. It was at this time that the apartment was divided and Apartment 1A created. The stylish Duchess of Kent continued to live in the apartment until her death at Kensington Palace of a brain tumour in 1968."]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort"]}, {"page": "Duke of Teck", "response": ["***Princess Mary of Teck, later Lady Mary Cambridge (1897\u20131987) m.

And then the outlook changed in April 1945, when his elder brother John Alexander Somerset was killed in action in the Allied invasion of Germany.

At her own death in 1994, this junior half-share in both baronies was inherited by her elder son David.  The barony Herbert was eventually called out of abeyance in his favour in 2002; that of Botetourt still remains in abeyance.Although David Seyfried, as he then was, was the junior heir, he had inherited a half-share of the barony as his mother's elder son.
