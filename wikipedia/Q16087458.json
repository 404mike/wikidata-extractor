The exact origin of the Cool S is unknown, but it may have originated from geometry textbooks and has appeared around the early 1970s as a part of graffiti culture. Contrary to popular belief, the symbol has no ties to either the U.S. clothing brand St\u00fcssy or to the character Superman, though St\u00fcssy did conduct an interview in 2010 with Jon Naar, a pioneer graffiti photographer with many works including this S, dating back to the 1970s.", "The origin of the Cool S is unclear. In the 1970s, photographer Howard Gribble took many photos of Los Angeles, many of which feature the number 8 in a similar style to the Cool S. In one of them, a very faded Cool S can be seen graffitied on a pavement. As the photo was taken in 1973, the S itself could date back to the 1960s, making it the earliest photographic evidence of the symbol. Also in 1973, Jon Naar's famous photographs of graffiti in New York featured the symbol many times, here identical to its modern form. Jean-Michel Basquiat's artworks occasionally had the symbol hidden somewhere, and in the one titled Olive Oil from 1982 it is labelled as the \"classic S of graff\".", "The name \"Superman S\" comes from a belief that it was a symbol for Superman, whose costume features a stylized S in a diamond shape, but that shape is quite different. Although frequently referred to as the St\u00fcssy S, Emmy Coats (who has worked alongside Shawn Stussy since 1985) has stated that it was never a symbol of the Californian surf company. A possible origin for this is that in 2010 the company uploaded a video to Vimeohttps://vimeo.com/9997635#t=1m38s and later to YouTubehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1m39s&v=iN9fQxxgBw8 in which one of Jon Naar's 1973 photographs of the symbol can be seen. However, accounts of attribution to Stussy precede the video by at least 20 years."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2017", "response": ["*Jon Naar, 97, British-American author and photographer.Jon Naar obituary"]}, {"page": "The Faith of Graffiti", "response": ["The Faith of Graffiti is a 1974 essay by American novelist and journalist Norman Mailer about New York City's graffiti artists. Mailer's essay appeared in a shorter form in Esquire and as a book with 81 photographs by Jon Naar and design by Mervyn Kurlansky. Through interviews, exploration, and analyses, the essay explored the political and artistic implications of graffiti. The essay was controversial at the time of publication because it attempts to validate graffiti as an art form by linking it with great artists of the past. Mailer, too, was criticized for using the essay as a platform for own political grievances. Faith grows out of Mailer's existential philosophy of the hip, in which a Hipster is guided by his instincts regardless of consequences or perception, and upholds graffiti as a subversive and healthy check on the status quo. Like several of his other non-fiction narratives, Mailer continues his use of new journalism: he adopts a persona, the A-I or \"Aesthetic Investigator\", to provide both an objective distance from the topic and to engender the text with the creative and critical eye of the novelist.", "After the tepid reception of his biography of Marilyn Monroe in 1973, Mailer began to struggle financially. In 1974, his Marilyn collaborator Lawrence Schiller sent Mailer photographs of New York City graffiti by Jon Naar and offered him $35,000 dollars for an essay to accompany them. Mailer agreed, and his then-agent Scott Meredith delivered a contract securing Mailer $50,000 for his work.", "The Faith of Graffiti was published on May 7, 1974. The work appeared simultaneously as a shorter essay in Esquire and as a book by Praeger Publishers. The project was conceived by Lawrence Schiller with 81 photographs by Jon Naar and book design by Mervyn Kurlansky. The book was also published in London in 1974 as Watching My Name Go By. The essay without photographs was reprinted in Mailer's 1982 collection Pieces and Pontifications and his 1998 anthology The Time of Our Time. In 2009, It Books republished the book with an additional 32 pages of photos and a new afterword by Jon Naar."]}]}}
