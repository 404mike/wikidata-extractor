He was a leader in human genome research and Chair of the Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation at the University of Manchester.\nSulston was in favour of science in the public interest, such as free public access of scientific information and against the patenting of genes and the privatisation of genetic technologies.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Apoptosis", "response": ["The 2002 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Sydney Brenner, H.

One of the university's aims stated in the Manchester 2015 Agenda is to be one of the top 25 universities in the world, following on from Alan Gilbert's aim to \"establish it by 2015 among the 25 strongest research universities in the world on commonly accepted criteria of research excellence and performance\".
