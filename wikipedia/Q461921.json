She had an exceptionally fine contralto voice and an agile singing technique, and impressed contemporary composers such as Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Elgar; the latter composed a song-cycle with her in mind as soloist.\nHer main career was as a recitalist and concert singer. She appeared in only two operatic productions, both of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. Later in her career she frequently appeared in recitals together with her husband, the baritone Kennerley Rumford. She made numerous recordings for the gramophone.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Elgar", "response": ["Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930.Kennedy (1970), pp. 38\u201339 It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms,\"Last Night of the Proms set to reach largest ever global audience\" , BBC, 7 September 2009.

C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House on 30 June 1902. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \"Land of Hope and Glory\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song.Moore (1984), pp. 364\u201367 It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem.

One reason for this was that she did not get on well with Sir Thomas Beecham, who was in control of the opera house for much of the period from 1910 until her retirement. She said, \"I dislike Beecham and his methods\", and he thought that while she had \"nearly all the attributes inseparable from great artistry ... she was wanting in a genuine spiritual refinement.\" Another factor in her reduced appearances at Covent Garden was the appearance on the scene of Luisa Tetrazzini, a soprano ten years her junior, who became a great success in London and later in New York in roles previously associated with Melba. A third reason was her decision to spend more time in Australia. In 1909 she undertook what she called a \"sentimental tour\" of Australia, covering 10,000 miles (16,000\u00a0km) and including many remote towns. In 1911 in partnership with the J. C. Williamson company, she appeared in an operatic season.
