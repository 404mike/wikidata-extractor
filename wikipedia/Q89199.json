He was the father of cinematographer Peter Suschitzky (born 1941), classical musician and writer Misha Donat, and Julia Donat.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 29", "response": ["*  1912   \u2013 Wolfgang Suschitzky, Austrian-English cinematographer and photographer (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "List of Austrians", "response": ["* Wolfgang Suschitzky, director of photography"]}, {"page": "Get Carter", "response": ["Producer Michael Klinger optioned Lewis' novel shortly after its publication and made a deal with the ailing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to finance and release the film, making Get Carter the last project to be approved by the studio's Borehamwood division before its closure. The production went from novel to finished film in eight months, with principal photography taking place from July to September of 1970 in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and County Durham. Hodges, Klinger and Caine intended to create a more realistic portrayal of violence and criminal behaviour than had previously been seen in British films: Caine, who also served as an uncredited co-producer, incorporated aspects of criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter, while Hodges  conducted research into the criminal underworld of Newcastle (in particular the one-armed bandit murder). Cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky also worked with Hodges to give scenes a naturalistic feel, drawing heavily on their backgrounds in documentary films.", "Principal photography took place in the North East between 17 July and 15 September 1970. Hodges favoured the use of long focal length lenses (as he had used previously on Rumour) in many scenes to create a naturalistic documentary feel, especially in crowd scenes. The film was shot in Metrocolor, which was MGM's trade name for films processed at its Eastmancolor laboratory. This lab processed Kodak's Eastman Color Negative, so it is most likely the film was shot on this stock. Asked to comment on what he was aiming for in the look of the film, cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky said \"The camera work on it [...] it was very influenced by Mike Hodges who has a very good eye for setups and he of course conferred with his operator and myself, but he influenced all of us, and much of the good look is due to him, I confess. My main task was lighting on location, very moderately, and waiting for the right daylight and setting the exposure on the lens\". In the first week of shooting in Newcastle, the ACTT called the crew out on a one-day strike. At the advice of Richard Lester, Hodges and his assistant director stayed at a separate hotel to the rest of the cast and crew, which enabled him to have some respite from the production after the shooting day was done. Klinger was present on set for much of the film shoot. However, Hodges said he encountered very little interference from the producer. At one point Klinger and Caine asked if Hodges might work in a \"chase sequence\", but he persuaded them that it would draw too many comparisons with Bullitt (a chase sequence between Carter and the London gangsters is mentioned in the shooting script).Chibnall, 2003, p. 80 Hodges tried to rehearse the racecourse scene between Caine and Hendry in their hotel the night before shooting, but \"Hendry's drunken and resentful state forced Hodges to abandon [the] attempt\".Chibnall, 2003, p. 56 Hodges described Caine as \"a complete dream to work with\". Caine only lost his temper once on set, during the very tense and emotional day filming in Glenda's flat, when the focus puller ruined his first take. Caine apologised immediately."]}, {"page": "1912 in art", "response": ["* August 29 \u2013  Wolfgang Suschitzky, Austrian-born documentary photographer and cinematographer (d.2016)"]}, {"page": "Paul Rotha", "response": ["Rotha was a close collaborator of John Grierson, and Wolfgang Suschitzky was one of his cinematographers.
