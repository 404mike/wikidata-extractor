Although there was talk of matching him against Archie Moore for the world title. He was fighting bigger men, who were just as strong as him and could absorb his punches whilst punching  as hard as he did, thus taking away some of the advantages he had enjoyed whilst boxing as a middleweight. He still dominated at a domestic level and  in 1955 he beat Alex Buxton to take the British and Commonwealth Light Heavyweight Titles. However, in October of that year he was knocked out by the unheralded Canadian dock worker Gordon Wallace. Suffering four knockdowns in the process and announced his retirement.", "He came out of retirement in 1956 and scored two wins before losing on points to Hans Stretz in Germany. In November of that year he beat Alex Buxton again for the British Light Heavyweight Title. The BBBC stopped a proposed fight between Turpin and Willie Pastrano from going ahead because they thought that it was not in the best interests of boxing. In other words they thought that Turpin might get hurt, which would damage the image of boxing. He had his final fight in 1958 when he was badly knocked out by Yolande Pompey. Turpin was knocked flat on his back by a right hand punch to the side of the head. He gamely tried to get up four times but each time stumbled whilst trying to regain his feet and fell back onto the canvas before being counted out. He had knocked Pompey down in the first round but instead of trying to finish him off had touched gloves in a gesture of sportsmanship, which may well have cost him the fight.", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Alex Buxton", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Alex Buxton", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Alex Buxton"]}, {"page": "Albert Finch", "response": ["He continued fighting as a light-heavyweight and in November 1954 he had another attempt at the British light-heavyweight title when he fought the holder, Alex Buxton, in Birmingham.

He lost his first encounter to Tommy Jones of Derby, but then beat Tommy Davies, the Wales middleweight champion in a non-title encounter. He finished the year losing to future British Light-heavyweight Champion, Alex Buxton. Having shown that he had the ability to stop the Welsh champion Davies, Houlston set his sights on winning a second Wales title. In 1947 he beat both Norman Jones and Des Jones in title eliminater contests to set up a return meeting with Davies, this time for the middleweight belt. Before facing Davies, Houlsten fought Johnny Williams, the result was a draw."]}, {"page": "Dennis Powell (boxer)", "response": ["In 1953 Randolph Turpin vacated his light heavyweight British title, leaving the title open. Powell and Walker were selected to challenge for the belt and on the 25 March 1953 the two men met at The Stadium in Liverpool. The fight was scheduled for 15 rounds but the referee stopped the contest in the eleventh with the decision going to Powell making him the British light heavyweight champion. The championship match was a vicious and bloody affair and it took its toll on both boxers. Walker was badly injured and fought only a few times more before retiring to become a minder for East End gangster Billy Hill, while Powell required twenty stitches to his face and in the eyes of one observer was \"never quite the same man again\". Just seven months after taking the title, Powell was challenged for his British title by Alex Buxton. The fight failed to reach the distance, with Powell losing by technical knockout in the tenth. He fought professionally just twice more, ending his career with a loss to Polly Smith in July 1954."]}]}}
