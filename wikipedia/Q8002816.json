He travelled extensively throughout Scotland and the rest of the UK, playing the numerous music halls of the time, where he performed his sketches and sang his songs in his own inimitable style. During the 1930s, he was one of the highest paid musical hall artistes in Britain.\nIn addition, Fyffe appeared in 23 major films of the era (American and British), sometimes starring, and recorded over 30 songs, delivered with his own unique style.\nHis singer-songwriter skills are still well-known today, particularly his own composition, \"I Belong To Glasgow\". This song has been covered by Danny Kaye, Eartha Kitt, Gracie Fields and Kirk Douglas:\n\n\"If your money, you spend,\nYou've nothing to lend,\nIsn't that all the better for you\"As a result of this song, Fyffe became forever associated with Glasgow, even though he was born 70 miles (110 km) away in the east coast city of Dundee, where a street bears his surname.\nFyffe was also Freemason, who was initiated and then became a full member of Lodge St John, Shotts No 471.\nFyffe left some rare footage of his stage act, which gives us a glimpse of stage life in those times. In the footage, he performs the \"Broomielaw\" sketch and sings his song \"Twelve and a Tanner a Bottle\". The footage came about as a result of a screen test, shot for Pathe in New York in 1929.\nFyffe died after falling from a window in the Rusacks Hotel in St Andrews in December 1947. The fall has been attributed to dizziness caused by an operation on his ear.", "link_mentions": {}}}
