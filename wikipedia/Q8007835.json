(A handful of other Victorian clubs remained accessible to minority candidates, including the East India Club whose members included the opium trader Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, but the NLC's ethnic minority members tended to be more radical and anti-imperialist than \"establishment\" figures such as Jejeebhoy.) The first recorded ethnic minority member of the NLC, Dadabhai Naoroji was admitted in 1885, when the club was less than three years old. Spurred on by Club Secretary William Digby (himself a long-standing anti-imperialist campaigner), by the late 1880s, the club had cultivated a large overseas and expatriate membership, particularly concentrated in India and among Indian nationals resident in London.Mira Matikkala, \u2018Anti-Imperialism, Englishness, andEmpire in late-Victorian Britain\u2019 (Cambridge, PhD, 2006).

About a quarter to a third of the population of Bengal starved to death in about a ten-month period. East India Company's raising of taxes disastrously coincided with this famine and exacerbated it, even if the famine was not caused by the British colonial government. Following this famine, \"Successive British governments were anxious not to add to the burden of taxation.\" The rains failed again in Bengal and Odisha in 1866. Policies of laissez faire were employed, which resulted in partial alleviation of the famine in Bengal. However, the southwest Monsoon made the harbor in Odisha inaccessible. As a result, food could not be imported into Odisha as easily as Bengal. In 1865\u201366, a severe drought struck Odisha and was met by British official inaction. The British Secretary of State for India, Lord Salisbury, did nothing for two months, by which time a million people had died. The lack of attention to the problem caused Salisbury to never feel free from blame. Some British citizens such as William Digby agitated for policy reforms and famine relief, but Lord Lytton, the governing British viceroy in India, opposed such changes in the belief that they would stimulate shirking by Indian workers. Reacting against calls for relief during the 1877\u201379 famine, Lytton replied, \"Let the British public foot the bill for its 'cheap sentiment,' if it wished to save life at a cost that would bankrupt India,\" substantively ordering \"there is to be no interference of any kind on the part of Government with the object of reducing the price of food,\" and instructing district officers to \"discourage relief works in every possible way .... Mere distress is not a sufficient reason for opening a relief work.\" The Lt.-Governor of Bengal, Sir Richard Temple, successfully intervened in the Bihar famine of 1874 with little to no mortality; this is the only known example of adequate measures meeting a food crisis by the British.Ertem, \u00d6zge. \u201dBritish Views on the Indian and Ottoman Famines: Politics, Culture, and Morality,\u201d In RCC Perspectives: The Imagination of Limits.

They sent out invitations to several likely candidates to speak to a public meeting: Henry Gladstone, younger son of Liberal Leader William Ewart Gladstone, accepted, as did Thomas Chatfeild Clarke, John Westlake QC, and Rev. William Sharman. However, Eugene Collins, whose constituency of Kinsale was being abolished, refused to participate in a contested selection. The Council eventually selected none of these: William Digby, a writer, ended up contesting the seat. Digby was a strong advocate of greater power for Indian natives.", "As an election loomed in June 1886, Lionel Cohen declared his intention to fight the seat again. Almost simultaneously, William Digby announced that he would not be a candidate again. The Paddington North Liberals therefore invited John Kempster, who had contested Enfield at the 1885 election, to be their candidate. Kempster was a Director of the Artizans, Labourers, and General Dwellings Company Ltd and therefore a popular man among the working-class residents in the constituency."]}, {"page": "History of Tamil Nadu", "response": ["Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in a severe famine in the Madras Presidency during 1876\u20131877.Romesh Chunder Dutt, Open Letters to Lord Curzon on Famines and Land Assessments in India, p10 The government and several charitable institutions organised relief work in the city and the suburbs. Funds were also raised from Europeans in India and overseas for the famine relief. Humanitarians such as William Digby wrote angrily about the woeful failure of the British administration to act promptly and adequately in response to the wholesale suffering caused by the famine. When the famine finally ended with the return of the monsoon in 1878, between three and five million people had perished. In response to the devastating effects of the famine, the government organised a Famine Commission in 1880 to define the principles of disaster relief. The government also instituted a famine insurance grant, setting aside 1.5 million Rupees. Other civic works such as canal building and improvements in roads and railway were also undertaken to minimise effects of any future famines."]}, {"page": "William Digby", "response": ["William Digby may refer to:", "* William Digby (priest) (1733-1788), British cleric", "* William Digby (writer) (1849-1904), British writer", "* William Digby, 5th Baron Digby (1661\u20131752), British peer and Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "Great Famine of 1876\u20131878", "response": ["Temple's recommendations were opposed by some officials, including William Digby and the physician W.

Quote: \"In the later nineteenth century, there was a series of disastrous crop failures in India leading not only to starvation but to epidemics. Most were regional, but the death toll could be huge. Thus, to take only some of the worst famines for which the death rate is known, some 800,000 died in the North West Provinces, Punjab, and Rajasthan in 1837\u201338; perhaps 2 million in the same region in 1860\u201361; nearly a million in different areas in 1866\u201367; 4.3 million in widely spread areas in 1876\u201378, an additional 1.2 million in the North West Provinces and Kashmir in 1877\u201378; and, worst of all, over 5 million in a famine that affected a large population of India in 1896\u201397. In 1899\u20131900 more than a million were thought to have died, conditions being worse because of the shortage of food following the famines only two years earlier. Thereafter the only major loss of life through famine was in 1943 under exceptional wartime conditions.(p. 132)\" Quote: \"Estimating the number of people who died as a result of a famine is not straightforward. Assumptions are required, and often they are not specified in detail and can be influenced by political considerations.

Towards the high end of the range, the campaigner William Digby\u2014who witnessed the crisis in Madras Presidency\u2014put the figure at 9.4 million for India.
