He insisted that the phrase \"having had a doing\" had referred to the rebukes Dr Whiteford had received from himself and several other MPs and was in the context of stopping debate before additional committee members had the opportunity further to scold Dr Whiteford. Liberal Democrat, Labour and Conservative committee members all stated that no threats were made. The 14 other people present, MPs and staff, were all interviewed by relevant whips and parliamentary authorities. None corroborated dr Whiteford's allegations.
