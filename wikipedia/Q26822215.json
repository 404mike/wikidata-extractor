After being suspended by Stager for insubordination, the two quit the team despite having eligibility remaining.  Speaking later of the conflict, Stager said: \"A foreign boy just doesn't have the team loyalty that an American boy has.  The foreign boys can't conceive, for example, that they should swim out of their stroke (a free-styler competing in the breast-stroke, for instance) so that the team will get points.  We train our boys to play for the team and not themselves from the time they step on the playground.  We do our best to instill team spirit in them from the start.  In most cases, the foreign students think it's just a lot of junk.  Most of them don't give a damn.  They're opportunists.  This doesn't go for all foreign athletes, but most of them are interested only in personal achievement. . . . I don't think there's another country in the world like the United States, where boys will sacrifice almost anything to see their team win.\""]}, {"page": "Swimming at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre backstroke", "response": ["| 3 || Bert Wardrop ||  || 1:09.9 || ", "| 1 || Bert Wardrop ||  || 1:07.8 ||", "| 6 ||  Bert Wardrop ||align=left|  ||1:07.8 ||  "]}, {"page": "Jack Wardrop", "response": ["He is the twin brother of Bert Wardrop and the pair learned to swim at Motherwell Baths.
