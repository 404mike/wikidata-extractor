When describing fellow housemate Dan Osborne he said that he was \"too white for [his] taste\", and he would prefer to have a \"nigger boy\". Rodrigo was given a formal and final warning by Big Brother regarding this incident, but Big Brother and Channel 5 were criticised by fans, with some of them questioning why he was not removed from the house immediately, using the example of Emily Parr's removal from the 2007 series to justify their reasons, and for the airing of the word on the highlights show. However, on Day 10, Rodrigo was removed from the house, after an unaired \"further incident\"."]}, {"page": "Dreamboys", "response": ["*Dan Osborne, former cast member of The Only Way Is Essex."]}, {"page": "Spornosexual", "response": ["The term originated in an article by cultural commentator Mark Simpson in 2014; Simpson's metrosexual is a portmanteau of metropolitan and heterosexual. He describes spornosexuals as frequently working class men who exercise at a gym in order to share eroticised selfies of their toned bodies on social media. Simpson considers spornosexuality as the second, more extreme, generation of metrosexuality, since the \"uptake by men of products, practises and pleasures previously ring-fenced for women and gay men\" has become normalised. Instead, Simpson claims, spornosexual men want to be recognised for their bodies rather than their clothes. Examples of such men include Dan Osborne, Thom Evans, David McIntosh and Cristiano Ronaldo."]}]}}
