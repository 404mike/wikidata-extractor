Trenches were cut into the chert at the end of this period, and Robert Kidston and William Henry Lang worked furiously to describe the plant fossils between 1917 and 1921. The arthropods were examined soon afterwards by different workers. Interest in the chert then waned until the field was reinvigorated by Alexander Geoffrey Lyon in the late 1950s, and new material was collected by further trenching from 1963 to 1971. Since 1980, the chert has been examined by the University of M\u00fcnster, and from 1987 by Aberdeen University, whose researchers confirmed that the chert was indeed produced in a hot spring setting."]}, {"page": "Walcot Gibson", "response": ["In 1921 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Rhynia was a vascular plant, and grew in association with other vascular plants such as Asteroxylon mackei,  a probable ancestor of modern clubmosses (Lycopsida),  and with pre-vascular plants such as Aglaophyton major, which is interpreted as basal to true vascular plants.
