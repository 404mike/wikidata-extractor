He began his career in music journalism in 1980, when he joined the London-based magazine Record Collector. He subsequently served as the editor there from 1982 to 1999, after which he continued in the role of managing editor. He has also contributed regularly to magazines such as Mojo, Q and GQ.Doggett has written extensively about the music and legacy of the Beatles. In the 2001 edition of Barry Miles' The Beatles Diary, he supplied commentary on each of the band's official releases (later compiled in his and Patrick Humphries' 2010 book The Beatles: The Music and the Myth). In 2003, he was part of a team of specialist writers and critics \u2013 along with Mark Lewisohn, Ian MacDonald, John Harris, David Fricke, Miles and others \u2013 who authored the three-part Mojo: Special Limited Edition series on the Beatles.In 2009, his book You Never Give Me Your Money: The Battle for the Soul of The Beatles was published in the UK by The Bodley Head. The Los Angeles Times described it as \"remarkable\" and included the work in its list of the ten best books of the year. According to Beatles historian Erin Torkelson Weber, You Never Give Me Your Money is \"one of the most influential books in all Beatles historiography\".Among Doggett's other titles, Are You Ready for the Country (2000) documents the advent of the country rock genre. His book on rock music's role in 1960s countercultural ideology, There's a Riot Going On, was published by Canongate in 2007 and was voted \"Best Book of the Year\" by Mojo's readers. His more recent books include The Man Who Sold the World: David Bowie and the 1970s (2011) and Electric Shock: From the Gramophone to the iPhone: 125 Years of Pop Music (2015).Doggett also works as a consultant for auctioneers of music memorabilia, specialising in the authentication of manuscripts and recordings. He has written CD liner notes and otherwise assisted in reissue campaigns of works by the Kinks, the Hollies and Tom Jones.In the 2010 UK General Election, he stood as the Green Party's candidate for the seat of Fareham in Hampshire, the same town in which he grew up.\nHe lives in London with his partner Rachel Baylis, an artist.

Starr's third million-selling single in the US, \"You're Sixteen\" was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four. Both tracks appeared on Starr's debut rock album, Ringo, produced by Richard Perry and featuring further contributions from Harrison as well as a song each from Lennon and McCartney. A commercial and critical success, the LP also included \"Oh My My\", a US number five. The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US.: peak UK chart positions for \"Oh My My\" and Ringo; : peak US chart position for Ringo. Author Peter Doggett describes Ringo as a template for Starr's solo career, saying that, as a musician first rather than a songwriter, \"he would rely on his friends and his charm, and if both were on tap, then the results were usually appealing\"."]}, {"page": "Sgt.

Sgt. Pepper was played in kiosks and stands there, and festival staff wore badges carrying Lennon's lyric \"A splendid time is guaranteed for all\"."]}, {"page": "Beatles for Sale", "response": ["McCartney later said that Beatles for Sale inaugurated a more mature phase for the band, whereby: \"We got more and more free to get into ourselves. Our student selves rather than 'we must please the girls and make money' \u2026\" According to author Peter Doggett, this period coincided with Lennon and McCartney being feted by London society, from which the pair found inspiration among a network of non-mainstream writers, poets, comedians, film-makers and other arts-related individuals. Doggett says that their social milieu in 1964 represented \"new territory for pop\" and a challenge to British class delineation as the Beatles introduced an \"arty middle-class\" sensibility to pop music."]}, {"page": "Rubber Soul", "response": ["Rubber Soul was the group's first album not to feature their name on the cover, an omission that reflected the level of control they had over their releases and the extent of their international fame. The cover photo of the Beatles was taken by photographer Robert Freeman in the garden at Lennon's house. The idea for the \"stretched\" effect of the image came about by accident when Freeman was projecting the photo onto an LP-size piece of cardboard for the Beatles' benefit, and the board fell slightly backwards, elongating the projected image. McCartney recalled the band's reaction: \"That's it, Rubber So-o-oul, hey hey! Can you do it like that?\" Author Peter Doggett highlights the cover as an example of the Beatles, like Dylan and the Stones, \"continu[ing] to test the limits of the portrait\" in their LP designs."]}, {"page": "Revolver (Beatles album)", "response": ["Author Peter Doggett describes \"I'm Only Sleeping\" as \"Half acid dream, half latent Lennon laziness personified.\" As with \"Rain\", the basic track was recorded at a faster tempo before being subjected to varispeeding. The latter treatment, along with ADT, was also applied to Lennon's vocal as he sought to replicate, in MacDonald's description, a \"papery old man's voice\". For the guitar solo, Harrison recorded two separate lines: the first with a clean sound, while on the second, he played his Gibson SG through a fuzzbox. Beatles biographer Jonathan Gould views the solo as appearing to \"suspend the laws of time and motion to simulate the half-coherence of the state between wakefulness and sleep\". Musicologist Walter Everett likens the song to a \"particularly expressive text painting\"."]}, {"page": "The Beatles (album)", "response": ["Peter Doggett writes that \"the most essential line of communication\" had been broken between Lennon and McCartney by Ono's presence on the first day of recording. Beatles biographer Philip Norman comments that the two shared a disregard for the other's new compositions; Lennon found McCartney's songs \"cloyingly sweet and bland\", while McCartney viewed Lennon's as \"harsh, unmelodious and deliberately provocative\". Harrison and Starr chose to distance themselves partway through the project, flying to California on 7 June so that Harrison could film his scenes for the Ravi Shankar documentary Raga. Lennon's, McCartney's and Harrison's individual projects outside the band in 1968 were further evidence of the group's fragmentation. In Lennon's case, the album cover of his experimental collaboration with Ono Two Virgins featured the couple completely naked, a gesture his bandmates found bewildering and unnecessary."]}, {"page": "Paul is dead", "response": ["Author Peter Doggett writes that, while the theory behind \"Paul is dead\" defied logic, its popularity was understandable in a climate where citizens were faced with conspiracy theories insisting that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 was in fact a coup d'\u00e9tat. Schaffner said that, given its origins as an item of gossip and intrigue generated by a select group in the \"Beatles cult\", \"Paul is dead\" serves as \"a genuine folk tale of the mass communications era\". He also described it as \"the most monumental hoax since Orson Welles' War of the Worlds broadcast persuaded thousands of panicky New Jerseyites that Martian invaders were in the vicinity\". In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald says that the Beatles were partly responsible for the phenomenon due to their incorporation of \"random lyrics and effects\", particularly in the White Album track \"Glass Onion\" in which Lennon invited clue-hunting by including references to other Beatles songs. MacDonald groups it with the \"psychic epidemics\" that were encouraged by the rock audience's use of hallucinogenic drugs and which escalated with Charles Manson's homicidal interpretation of the White Album and Mark David Chapman's religion-motivated murder of Lennon in 1980."]}, {"page": "Magic Alex", "response": ["After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least \u00a3300,000 (\u00a3 in  pounds if it was essentially spent in 1968). Starr once approved of one of Mardas' ideas: \"He [Mardas] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio \u2013 you'd have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren't interested at all.\" According to author Peter Doggett, in the Beatles' history, Mardas is the only individual who occupies a place close to Klein's in terms of vilification from commentators and biographers."]}, {"page": "Penny Lane", "response": ["\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" were released as a double A-side single, in a fashion identical to that of the Beatles' previous single, \"Eleanor Rigby\" / \"Yellow Submarine\". The release took place in the United States on 13 February 1967 and in the United Kingdom on 17 February. It was the first single by the Beatles to be sold with a picture sleeve in the UK, a practice rarely used there at that time. Expectations were high for the release, since it was the band's first new music since they had decided to abandon touring, a decision that had led to speculation in the press in late 1966 that the group would disband. Comparing the two sides, author Clinton Heylin writes that McCartney was possibly \"fearful of alienating fans unduly\" with the more dense and experimental \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". He says that with \"Penny Lane\", McCartney was \"again cast in the role of the great populariser\" by providing the \"more prosaic depiction of the Liverpool of their youth ... set to another of his eminently hummable melodies\". In his book Electric Shock, Peter Doggett describes \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" as art pop, \"self-consciously excluding the mass audience\", and likens \"Penny Lane\" to pop art in its evoking \"multifaceted substance out of the everyday\"."]}, {"page": "Strawberry Fields Forever", "response": ["The double A-side single was issued by Capitol Records in the US on 13 February 1967 (as Capitol 5810), and by EMI's Parlophone label in the United Kingdom on 17 February (as Parlophone R 5570). Aside from the compilation album A Collection of Beatles Oldies, issued in the UK but not the US, it was the first release by the Beatles since Revolver and their August 1966 single. It was also the first Beatles single in the UK to be presented in a picture sleeve. The front of the sleeve contained a studio photo that again demonstrated the band's adoption of facial hair; on the back cover were individual pictures of the four Beatles as infants, which heightened the connection to a Liverpool childhood.

Ian MacDonald wrote in his book Revolution in the Head that it \"shows expression of a high order \u2026 few if any [contemporary composers] are capable of displaying feeling and fantasy so direct, spontaneous, and original.\" According to music critic Tim Riley, the song \"transformed Lennon's creative arc\" by \"expand[ing] the hallucinogenic drone of 'Rain' into layered colours that shifted when lit by his vocal inflections\" and by inaugurating his use of free-form verse as a lyrical device. Riley adds that while it represented Lennon's \"first glimpse of life\" outside the Beatles, \"part of the recording's ironic pull lies in how the Beatles drape a group sensibility around Lennon's abstract psyche, something only the most intimate of musical friends could do.\" In his commentary on the track in The Beatles' Diary, Peter Doggett describes the song as \"the greatest pop record ever made\" and \"a record that never dates, because it lives outside time\".

Author Peter Doggett writes that the design was at odds with the increasingly sophisticated cover portraits used on releases by artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan over 1965\u201367.

With Bowie producing himself, the song was recorded rather quickly, in about 90 minutes and in only one take, other than a few overdubs, according to Bolder. After the session, the band and crew left New York to continue the tour in Chicago. Bowie's manager Tony Defries originally wanted to enlist Phil Spector to produce the album, but after receiving no response from Spector, Bowie invited Scott back to co-produce. Two months later on 9 December, the band reconvened in New York with Scott and recorded \"Drive-In Saturday\" and the Bowie-penned Mott the Hoople-track \"All the Young Dudes\". The American tour concluded later that month, after which the band returned overseas to perform a series of Christmas concerts in England and Scotland. Following these concerts, the band regrouped at Trident Studios in London on 19 January 1973 to record the remainder of the album. On this day, the band recorded \"1984\", which, while left off Aladdin Sane, became an important track thematically for Bowie's Diamond Dogs (1974). The following day, the band taped the backing tracks for \"Panic in Detroit\", the title track and the \"sax version\" of the non-album single \"John, I'm Only Dancing\". A provisional running order was compiled the same day, including \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" and an unknown track titled \"Zion\".
