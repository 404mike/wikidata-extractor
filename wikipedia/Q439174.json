He made his feature film debut playing talent agent Fintan O'Donnell in Hear My Song (1991). He got his breakthrough television role playing Adam Williams in the romantic comedy-drama series Cold Feet (1997\u20132003, 2016\u2013present), which won him a British Comedy Award, a Television and Radio Industries Club Award, and a National Television Award.\nNesbitt's first significant film role came when he appeared as pig farmer \"Pig\" Finn in Waking Ned (1998). With the rest of the starring cast, he was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award. In Lucky Break (2001), he made his debut as a film lead, playing prisoner Jimmy Hands. The next year, he played Ivan Cooper in the television film Bloody Sunday, about the 1972 shootings in Derry. A departure from his previous \"cheeky chappie\" roles, the film was a turning point in his career. He won a British Independent Film Award and was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.\nNesbitt has also starred in Murphy's Law (2001\u20132007) as undercover detective Tommy Murphy, a role that was created for him by writer Colin Bateman. The role twice gained Nesbitt Best Actor nominations at the Irish Film & Television Awards (IFTA). In 2007, he starred in the dual role of Tom Jackman and Mr Hyde in Steven Moffat's Jekyll, which earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination in 2008. Nesbitt has since appeared in several more dramatic roles; he starred alongside Liam Neeson in Five Minutes of Heaven (2009), and was one of three lead actors in the television miniseries Occupation (2009). He also starred in the movies Outcast (2010) and The Way (2010). He portrayed Bofur in The Hobbit film series (2012\u20132014). In 2014, Nesbitt starred as Tony Hughes in the acclaimed BBC One drama series The Missing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bloody Sunday (1972)", "response": ["The events of the day have been dramatised in two 2002 television films, Bloody Sunday (starring James Nesbitt) and Sunday by Jimmy McGovern."]}, {"page": "January 15", "response": ["*  1965   \u2013 James Nesbitt, Northern Irish actor"]}, {"page": "Press Gang", "response": ["Moffat has integrated many references to secondary characters and locations in Press Gang in his later work.

As with most modern adaptations, Hyde is depicted as possessing superhuman strength, able to tear a lion apart with his bare hands, and is depicted as being impulsive and childish rather than explicitly evil, although the physical changes are fairly subtle, such as Hyde having darker eyes and a different hairstyle. At the series' conclusion, Hyde apparently sacrifices himself to save Jackman, \"dying\" when he is shot but somehow able to stop Jackman \"sharing the damage\", with the result that the bullets remain in Jackman but he has no injuries to demonstrate where they entered his body."]}, {"page": "Anne Dudley", "response": ["*Lucky Break (2001), a British feelgood comedy starring James Nesbitt and based around a prison escape; "]}, {"page": "British Independent Film Awards", "response": ["* James Nesbitt"]}, {"page": "Herne Hill", "response": ["*James Nesbitt, actor"]}, {"page": "Coleraine", "response": ["* James Nesbitt\u00a0\u2013 actor"]}, {"page": "Portrush", "response": ["* Portrush is also home to Barry's Amusements, the largest amusement park in Northern Ireland.

The series was created and principally written by Mike Bullen as a follow-up to his award-winning 1997 Comedy Premiere special of the same name. The series follows three couples experiencing the ups-and-downs of romance, originally Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), Pete and Jenny Gifford (John Thomson and Fay Ripley) and Karen and David Marsden (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst). As the original series progressed, the Giffords divorced and Pete married Jo Ellison (Kimberley Joseph), whilst Karen and David also separated, forming relationships with Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee) and Robyn Duff (Lucy Robinson).", "Series creator Mike Bullen's working relationship with Granada Television began in 1994 when his agent sold his first screenplay, a one-off comedy-drama called The Perfect Match, to the company's head of comedy Andy Harries. Harries had been looking for television scripts that would reflect the lives of people from his generation\u2014people in their 30s who were under-represented on television. The Perfect Match, about a man who proposes to his girlfriend at the FA Cup Final and has to deal with constant media attention afterwards, was made and then broadcast in 1995. Harries asked Bullen to pitch more ideas for television to The Perfect Matchs assistant producer Christine Langan.Tibballs, pp.\u00a09\u201310. As a fan of American television such as Thirtysomething, Frasier and Hill Street Blues, Bullen pitched Cold Feet, a traditional \"boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl-back\" story told from both sides of the relationship but using elements of fantasy and flashback to distort events to fit a character's point of view.Smith, p.\u00a06.Tibballs, p.\u00a07. The initial pitch centred on Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), which Harries believed would diminish the storytelling potential if the ITV Network Centre commissioned a full series after the pilot, so Bullen \"tacked on\" plots for two other couples\u2014Adam and Rachel's respective friends Pete and Jenny Gifford (John Thomson and Fay Ripley) and David and Karen Marsden (Robert Bathurst and Hermione Norris).Tibballs, p.\u00a018.", "Cold Feet began its first series with the six main cast members\u2014James Nesbitt, Helen Baxendale, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst\u2014who had appeared in the pilot. Thomson's character Pete Gifford was written specifically for him after his performance in The Perfect Match made a positive impression on Christine Langan.Tibballs, p.\u00a012. Norris originally auditioned for the part of Rachel but was cast as Karen because the role suited her social class. Nesbitt got an audition through a mutual friend of pilot director Declan Lowney, and read the part in his natural accent because he was keen to play a Northern Irish character in a contemporary drama unconnected to The Troubles.Smith, p.\u00a027. Baxendale was best known for her role in Cardiac Arrest and was hesitant to star as Rachel because she did not believe she could perform comedy. Bathurst was known to Langan for his starring role in Joking Apart. Ripley thought she would be auditioning for the part of Rachel, and had to put on an accent for her role as natural Mancunian Jenny. When the fourth series was commissioned, Ripley announced that she was leaving the show to broaden her career options.Smith, p.\u00a076. Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, a replacement character who remained on screen until the conclusion of Cold Feets first run.Smith, p.\u00a0170.
