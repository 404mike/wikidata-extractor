He studied history at the University of Birmingham, where he was awarded a prize for European history, but halted his studies after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union. Carr volunteered and served in the Royal Corps of Signals and Royal Artillery. After victory, he worked as an interpreter of German internees before joining the Field Security Police. Carr returned to Birmingham University in 1947, where he was awarded a first class degree in 1948.Carr was appointed lecturer in history at the University of Sheffield in 1952, then senior lecturer (1963), reader (1970) and then to a personal chair (1979). He retired in 1986. A few days before his death, Carr learnt that the German government had awarded him the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Kershaw", "response": ["In a 2008 interview, Kershaw lists as his major intellectual influences Martin Broszat, Hans Mommsen, Alan Milward, Timothy Mason, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, William Carr and Jeremy Noakes. In the same interview, Kershaw expressed strong approval of Mason's \"Primacy of Politics\" concept, in which it was German Big Business that served the Nazi regime rather than the other way around, against the orthodox Marxist \"Primacy of Economics\" concept. Despite his praise and admiration for Mason, in the 2000 edition of The Nazi Dictatorship, Kershaw was highly skeptical of Mason's \"Flight into War\" theory of an economic crisis in 1939 forcing the Nazi regime into war.Kershaw, Ian, The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems & Perspectives of Interpretation, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 88\u201389"]}, {"page": "Adolf Hitler", "response": ["In private discussions in 1939, Hitler declared Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland's obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal. The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany's . Offended by the British \"guarantee\" on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence, he said, \"I shall brew them a devil's drink\". In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship  on 1 April, he threatened to denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence, which he perceived as an \"encirclement\" policy. Poland was to either become a German satellite state or it would be neutralised in order to secure the Reich's eastern flank and prevent a possible British blockade. Hitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state, but upon its rejection by the Polish government, he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939. On 3 April, Hitler ordered the military to prepare for  (\"Case White\"), the plan for invading Poland on 25 August. In a Reichstag speech on 28 April, he renounced both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Historians such as William Carr, Gerhard Weinberg, and Ian Kershaw have argued that one reason for Hitler's rush to war was his fear of an early death. He had repeatedly claimed that he must lead Germany into war before he got too old, as his successors might lack his strength of will."]}, {"page": "William Carr", "response": ["*William Carr (Bristol MP) (died 1575), MP for Bristol", "*William Carr (Newcastle-upon-Tyne MP, died 1572), MP for Newcastle-upon-Tyne", "*William Carr (Newcastle-upon-Tyne MP, died 1720), MP for Newcastle-upon-Tyne", "*William Carr (Newcastle-upon-Tyne MP, died 1742), MP for Newcastle-upon-Tyne", "*William Carr (footballer) (1848\u20131924), England international football goalkeeper", "*William Carr (rower) (1876\u20131942), American rower", "*William Carr (arena football) (born 1975), American and arena football player and assistant coach", "*William Carr (cricketer) (born 1976), Australian cricketer", "*William Carr (admiral) (1883\u20131966), Australian naval officer", "*William Carr (biographer) (1862\u20131925), British biographer for the Dictionary of National Biography", "*William Carr (historian) (1921\u20131991), British historian"]}]}}
