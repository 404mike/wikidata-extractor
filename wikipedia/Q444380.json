The only child of the composer Gustav Holst, she is particularly known for her educational work at Dartington Hall in the 1940s, and for her 20 years as joint artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival. In addition to composing music, she wrote composer biographies, much educational material, and several books on the life and works of her father.\nFrom a young age, Holst showed precocious talent in composing and performance. After attending Eothen School and St Paul's Girls' School, she entered the Royal College of Music, where she developed her skills as a conductor and won several prizes for composing. Unable to follow her initial ambitions to be a pianist or a dancer due to health reasons, Holst spent most of the 1930s teaching, and as a full-time organiser for the English Folk Dance and Song Society. These duties reduced her compositional activities, although she made many arrangements of folksongs. After serving as an organiser for the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts at the start of the Second World War, in 1942 she began working at Dartington. In her nine years there she established Dartington as a major centre of music education and activity.\nIn the early 1950s Holst became Benjamin Britten's musical assistant, moved to Aldeburgh, and began helping with the organisation of the annual Aldeburgh Festival. In 1956 she became joint artistic director of the festival, and during the following 20 years helped it to a position of pre-eminence in British musical life. In 1964 she gave up her work as Britten's assistant, to resume her own compositional career and to concentrate on the preservation of her father's musical legacy. Her own music is not widely known and has received little critical attention; much of it is unpublished and unperformed. The first recordings dedicated to her works, issued in 2009 and 2012, were warmly received by critics. She was appointed CBE in 1975 and received numerous academic honours. She died at Aldeburgh and is buried in the churchyard there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rhythm", "response": ["The metric structure of music includes meter, tempo and all other rhythmic aspects that produce temporal regularity against which the foreground details or durational patterns of the music are projected ().

McDonald commented in 2009 that Falstaff is very different \u2013 a stylistic departure \u2013 from Verdi's earlier work.McDonald 2009, p. 7 In McDonald's view most of the musical expression is in the dialogue, and there is only one traditional aria. The result is that \"such stylistic economy \u2013 more sophisticated, more challenging than he had employed before \u2013 is the keynote of the work.\" McDonald argues that consciously or unconsciously, Verdi was developing the idiom that would come to dominate the music of the 20th century: \"the lyricism is abbreviated, glanced at rather than indulged. Melodies bloom suddenly and then vanish, replaced by contrasting tempo or an unexpected phrase that introduces another character or idea\". In McDonald's view the orchestral writing acts as a sophisticated commentator on the action. It has influenced at least one of Verdi's operatic successors: in 1952 Imogen Holst, musical assistant to Benjamin Britten, wrote, after a performance of Falstaff, \"I realised for the first time how much Ben owes to [Verdi]. There are orchestral bits which are just as funny to listen to as the comic instrumental bits in A. Herring!\"Grogan, p. 169"]}, {"page": "Gustav Holst", "response": ["To support himself during his studies Holst played the trombone professionally, at seaside resorts in the summer and in London theatres in the winter.Holst (1981), p. 19 His daughter and biographer, Imogen Holst, records that from his fees as a player \"he was able to afford the necessities of life: board and lodging, manuscript paper, and tickets for standing room in the gallery at Covent Garden Opera House on Wagner evenings\". He secured an occasional engagement in symphony concerts, playing in 1897 under the baton of Richard Strauss at the Queen's Hall.", "Towards the end of his life Holst wrote the Choral Fantasia (1930) and he was commissioned by the BBC to write a piece for military band; the resulting prelude and scherzo Hammersmith was a tribute to the place where he had spent most of his life. The composer and critic Colin Matthews considers the work \"as uncompromising in its way as Egdon Heath, discovering, in the words of Imogen Holst, 'in the middle of an over-crowded London\u00a0... the same tranquillity that he had found in the solitude of Egdon Heath'\". The work was unlucky in being premiered at a concert that also featured the London premiere of Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, by which it was somewhat overshadowed.", "Although Holst wrote a large number of works\u2014particularly songs\u2014during his student days and early adulthood, almost everything he wrote before 1904 he later classified as derivative \"early horrors\".Holst (1980), p. 661 Nevertheless, the composer and critic Colin Matthews recognises even in these apprentice works an \"instinctive orchestral flair\". Of the few pieces from this period which demonstrate some originality, Matthews pinpoints the G minor String Trio of 1894 (unperformed until 1974) as the first underivative work produced by Holst. Matthews and Imogen Holst each highlight the \"Elegy\" movement in The Cotswold Symphony (1899\u20131900) as among the more accomplished of the apprentice works, and Imogen discerns glimpses of her father's real self in the 1899 Suite de ballet and the Ave Maria of 1900. She and Matthews have asserted that Holst found his genuine voice in his setting of Whitman's verses, The Mystic Trumpeter (1904), in which the trumpet calls that characterise Mars in The Planets are briefly anticipated. In this work, Holst first employs the technique of bitonality\u2014the use of two keys simultaneously.", "The combined influence of Ravel, Hindu spiritualism and English folk tunes enabled Holst to get beyond the once all-consuming influences of Wagner and Richard Strauss and to forge his own style. Imogen Holst has acknowledged Holst's own suggestion (written to Vaughan Williams): \"[O]ne ought to follow Wagner until he leads you to fresh things\". She notes that although much of his grand opera, Sita, is \"'good old Wagnerian bawling'\u00a0... towards the end a change comes over the music, and the beautifully calm phrases of the hidden chorus representing the Voice of the Earth are in Holst's own language.\"Holst (1986), p. 134", "In the Ode to Death (1918\u201319), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an \"abrupt volte-face\" after the life-enhancing spirituality of the Hymn. Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the Ode expressed Holst's private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer Ernest Walker thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.Dickinson (1995), p. 36", "Holst composed few large-scale works in his final years. A Choral Fantasia of 1930 was written for the Three Choirs Festival at Gloucester; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, \"knows something of the 'colossal and mysterious' loneliness of Egdon Heath\".Holst (1986), pp. 100\u2013101 Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst's remaining works were for small forces; the eight Canons of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen's view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers. The Brook Green Suite (1932), written for the orchestra of St Paul's School, was a late companion piece to the St Paul's Suite. The Lyric Movement for viola and small orchestra (1933) was written for Lionel Tertis. Quiet and contemplative, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was slow to gain popularity among violists.Short, pp. 324\u2013325 Robin Hull, in Penguin Music Magazine, praised the work's \"clear beauty\u2014impossible to mistake for the art of any other composer\"; in Dickinson's view, however, it remains \"a frail creation\".Dickinson (1995), p. 154 Holst's final composition, the orchestral scherzo movement of a projected symphony, contains features characteristic of much of Holst's earlier music\u2014\"a summing up of Holst's orchestral art\", according to Short.Short, pp. 319\u2013320 Dickinson suggests that the somewhat casual collection of material in the work gives little indication of the symphony that might have been written.Dickinson (1995), p. 157"]}, {"page": "The Planets", "response": ["Imogen Holst, the composer's daughter, wrote that her father had difficulty with large-scale orchestral structures such as symphonies, and the idea of a suite with a separate character for each movement was an inspiration to him.Holst (1986), p. 32 Holst's biographer Michael Short and the musicologist Richard Greene both think it likely that another inspiration for the composer to write a suite for large orchestra was the example of Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra.Short, p. 119; and Greene, p. 18 That suite had been performed in London in 1912 and again in 1914; Holst was at one of the performances, and he is known to have owned a copy of the score.Lambourn, David. \"Henry Wood and Schoenberg\", The Musical Times , August 1987, pp. 422\u2013427  ", "Holst had a heavy workload as head of music at St Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith and director of music at Morley College,Warrack, John. \"Holst, Gustav Theodore\" , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2011.

Imogen Holst wrote, \"Weekends and holidays were the only times when he could really get on with his own work, which is why it took him over two years to finish The Planets\". She added that Holst's chronic neuritis in his right arm was troubling him considerably and he would have found it impossible to complete the 198 pages of the large full score without the help of two colleagues at St Paul's, Vally Lasker and Nora Day, whom he called his \"scribes\".Holst (1981), p. 50", "At a Royal Philharmonic Society concert at the Queen's Hall on 27 February 1919 conducted by Boult, five of the seven movements were played in the order Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Uranus, and Jupiter.\"London Concerts\", The Musical Times, April 1919, p. 179   It was Boult's decision not to play all seven movements at this concert. Although Holst would have liked the suite to be played complete, Boult's view was that when the public were being presented with a completely new language of this kind, \"half an hour of it was as much as they could take in\".Kennedy, p. 68 Imogen Holst recalled that  her father \"hated incomplete performances of The Planets, though on several occasions he had to agree to conduct three or four movements at Queen's Hall concerts. He particularly disliked having to finish with Jupiter, to make a 'happy ending', for, as he himself said, 'in the real world the end is not happy at all'\".Holst (1974), p. 125", "The second movement begins adagio in .Holst (1921), p. 32 According to Imogen Holst, Venus \"has to try and bring the right answer to Mars\". The movement opens with a solo horn theme answered quietly by the flutes and oboes. A second theme is given to solo violin. The music proceeds tranquilly with oscillating chords from flutes and harps, with decoration from the celesta.Holst (1986), p. 34 Between the opening adagio and the central largo there is a flowing andante section in  with a violin melody (solo then tutti) accompanied by gentle syncopation in the woodwind. The oboe solo in the central largo is one of the last romantic melodies Holst allowed himself before turning to a more austere manner in later works.

Dedicated posthumously to Imogen Holst, it was first performed in Manchester on 11 May 2000, with Kent Nagano conducting.

This \"perception\" and \"abstraction\" of rhythmic bar is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into \"tick\u2013tock\u2013tick\u2013tock\". \"Rhythms of recurrence\" arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups.

Her name was inspired by that of British composer Imogen Holst, as her mother wanted Heap to become a cellist like Holst. She played music from an early age, first learning the piano due to \"wanting attention\" as a middle child and realizing, according to her, that \"it was something [she] could make a lot of noise with\". She did not enjoy playing the music of classical composers such as Bach and Beethoven, and would instead attempt to play in their style to convince her parents she was practicing their music. As a child, she began recording music by recording herself playing piano on cassette, then recording herself again singing over it. She soon began taking lessons and became classically trained in several instruments including piano, cello, and clarinet while attending Friends School, a private, Quaker-run boarding school in Saffron Walden. At around age 10, she began composing Christmas carols for her school's choir."]}, {"page": "Snape Maltings", "response": ["The Holst Library is connected to the Maltings.

According to her press release for the Aldeburgh Festival Office, \"the Gustav Holst Library will be a working library for the use of the students.

These would show Britten composing and rehearsing a work through to its performance, and would provide children with \"an intimate piece of musical education, by\u00a0... watching a piece of music take shape and in some degree growing with it\". Britten was initially cautious; he found the idea interesting but, he warned Ford, he was at that time  busy  travelling, and had little time for writing. He was also anxious not to cover the same ground as he had with Let's Make an Opera.Letter dated 15 April 1957, quoted in  However, he agreed to meet Ford  to discuss the project further. On 11 July they met in London, together with Britten's musical assistant Imogen Holst. Britten told Ford that he had \"for some months or a year vaguely been thinking of doing something with the [Chester] miracle plays\", and agreed to write an opera for A-R's 1958 summer term of school programmes. The subject would be Noah and the flood, based on the Chester text. Later, Ford and his script editor, Martin Worth, travelled to Aldeburgh, and with Britten looked at possible churches for the performance. St Bartholomew's Church, Orford, was chosen as, unlike most other churches in East Suffolk, its pews were not fixed, thus offering a more flexible performing space.", "For the first time in any of his works involving amateurs, Britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces, led by what Graham described as \"the professional stiffening\" of a piano duet, string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and bass), recorder and a timpanist. The young musicians play a variety of instruments, including a full string ensemble with each section led by a member of the professional string quintet. The violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty, from the simplest (mostly playing open strings) to those able to play in third position. The recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to flutter-tongue; bugles, played in the original production by boys from a local school band, are played as the children representing animals march into the ark, and at the climax of the opera. The child percussionists, led by a professional timpanist, play various exotic and invented percussion instruments: the score itself specifies sandpaper (\"two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together\"), and \"Slung Mugs\", the latter used to represent the first drops of rain. Britten originally had the idea of striking teacups with a spoon, but having failed to make this work, he sought Imogen Holst's advice. She recalled that \"by great good fortune I had once had to teach Women's Institute percussion groups during a wartime 'social half hour', so I was able to take him into my kitchen and show him how a row of china mugs hanging on a length of string could be hit with a large wooden spoon.", "Britten also added \u2013 relatively late in the process of scoring the work \u2013 an ensemble of handbell ringers. According to Imogen Holst, a member of the Aldeburgh Youth Club brought Britten's attention to a local group of  bellringers; hearing them play, Britten was so enchanted by the sound that he gave the ensemble a major part to play as the rainbow unfolds towards the end of the opera. Several commentators, including Michael Kennedy, Christopher Palmer and Humphrey Carpenter, have noted the affinity between the sound of Britten's use of the handbells and the gamelan ensembles he had heard first-hand in Bali in 1956.; ; and  The scarcity of handbells tuned at several of the pitches required by Britten in the opera was to become an issue when the score was being prepared for publication.", "After the score had been published, and in the face of an imminent performance in Ettal, Britten suggested that he could attempt to rewrite the music for a handbell ensemble in D, since sets in that key were more common than in E flat.Letter dated 28 February 1959, quoted in  Britten never prepared this alternative version for reduced instrumentation. He did agree, however, to make the published full score \"less bulky\" by presenting the amateur forces of recorders, ripieno strings and percussion in the form of short score, on the understanding that full scores for those groups would be available to hire for rehearsal and performance purposes. The full score was published in 1958,(Click \"View Sample\" for first page of score with copyright details) and the vocal score, prepared by Imogen Holst with the libretto translated into German by Prince Ludwig of Hesse and the Rhine,  under the pseudonym Ludwig Landgraf, was published in 1959.
