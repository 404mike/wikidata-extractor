She was a contestant on the third series of The Apprentice in 2007; following further appearances in the media, she became a columnist for British national newspapers. Hopkins wrote for The Sun in 2013 and the Daily Mail's website MailOnline from 2015 to 2017. In 2015, she hosted her own television talk show If Katie Hopkins Ruled the World, and appeared on the fifteenth series of Celebrity Big Brother, finishing as runner-up. The following year, she became a presenter for the talk radio station LBC and underwent major brain surgery to treat her epilepsy. In 2021, Hopkins joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP).Hopkins' social media presence and outspoken views, especially on UK politics, social class, migrants and race, have attracted controversy, criticism, media scrutiny, legal issues, protests and petitions. She has been accused of racism by journalists, advocacy groups and politicians for her comments about migrants. In 2016, Mail Online was forced to pay significant damages to a Muslim family whom Hopkins had falsely accused of extremist links. In the 2017 libel case Monroe v Hopkins, Hopkins was required to pay damages and legal costs to Jack Monroe after making defamatory remarks on Twitter. \nHer role at LBC was terminated in May 2017 following her comments on Twitter about the need for a \"final solution\" \u2014 a term used by the Nazis to refer to the Holocaust \u2014 after the Manchester Arena bombing; she later altered it to \"true solution\", describing the earlier version as a \"mis-type\". Hopkins was permanently suspended from Twitter in June 2020 for what the company described as \"violations of our hateful conduct policy\"; she joined Parler afterwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 13", "response": ["*  1975   \u2013 Katie Hopkins, English media personality and columnist"]}, {"page": "Reality television", "response": ["Reality television has the potential to turn its participants into national celebrities, at least for a short period. This is most notable in talent-search programs such as Idol and The X Factor, which have spawned music stars in many of the countries in which they have aired. Many other shows, however, have made at least temporary celebrities out of their participants; some participants have then been able to parlay this fame into media and merchandising careers. Participants of non-talent-search programs who have had subsequent acting careers include Lilian Afegbai, Jacinda Barrett, Jamie Chung, Stephen Colletti, David Giuntoli, Vishal Karwal, NeNe Leakes and Angela Trimbur; though Barrett and Trimbur were already aspiring actresses when they appeared on reality television. Reality TV participants who have become television hosts and personalities include Nabilla Benattia, Rachel Campos-Duffy, Kristin Cavallari, Colby Donaldson, Raffaella Fico, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Katie Hopkins, Rebecca Jarvis, Jodie Marsh, Heidi Montag, Tiffany Pollard and Whitney Port; some of them have had acting careers as well. Reality TV participants who have become television personalities as well as successful entrepreneurs include Gemma Collins, Lauren Conrad, Jade Goody, Bethenny Frankel and Spencer Matthews. Several cast members of MTV's Jersey Shore have had lucrative endorsement deals, and in some cases their own product lines.

He told press \"it is fake\", that he didn't know any of the other celebrities and quite frankly, \"he didn't have the time\". He was replaced by Katie Hopkins. The following year he featured as one of the 'celebrity hijackers' in the UK TV series Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack, which was broadcast on E4.
