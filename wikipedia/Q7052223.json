Together with Bram Stoker, he helped to organize Irving's funeral; a large body of letters connected with this event still exist.\nForbes-Robertson was a prominent member of London's exclusive Garrick Club.  According to \"The History of the Tie\", one afternoon in the 1920s, he wore a salmon-and-cucumber tie to lunch at the Garrick Club, joking that it was the official club tie.  Thereafter it was adopted as such.\nIn the early 20th century, he owned and restored Stocks Mill in Wittersham, Kent.

The mill may be older and may have been moved from Stone in Oxney, with the date 1781 carved into the main post denoting its re-erection. The Mill House was at one time used as the parish Poorhouse. The mill was last worked circa 1900, and was then preserved by Norman Forbes-Robertson, who owned the mill and Mill House. The mill passed into the ownership of the artist Randolph H Sauter. and then Sir Edward Parry. The mill was repaired in 1958, and in 1968 a new stock and pair of sails was fitted by the millwright Derek Ogden. In 1980, the mill was acquired by Kent County Council and the Friends of Stocks Mill was set up to allow the mill to be opened to the public. The mill underwent a restoration programme starting in 2002 and partly funded by the National Lottery, which included two new sails amongst other work. Some of the milling machinery which had been removed over the years was recreated. The mill was reopened to the public in 2004."]}, {"page": "Johnston Forbes-Robertson", "response": ["Born in London, he was the eldest of the eleven children of John Forbes-Robertson, a theatre critic and journalist from Aberdeen, and his wife Frances.
