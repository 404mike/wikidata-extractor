Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year.

Doctor Who debuted on 23 November 1963 and quickly became a success for the BBC, chiefly on the popularity of the alien creatures known as Daleks. Lambert's superior, Head of Serials Donald Wilson, had strongly advised against using the script in which the Daleks first appeared, but after the serial's successful airing, he said that Lambert clearly knew the series far better than he did, and he would no longer interfere in her decisions. The success of Doctor Who and the Daleks also garnered press attention for Lambert herself; in 1964, the Daily Mail published a feature on the series focusing on its young producer's looks: \"The operation of the Daleks\u00a0... is conducted by a remarkably attractive young woman called Verity Lambert who, at 28, is not only the youngest but the only female drama producer at B.B.C.

After also initiating other popular series such as Adam Adamant Lives!, at the end of 1967 Newman's five-year contract with the BBC came to an end, and he did not remain with the Corporation.

On September 16, following Tucker's departure from the show, Christopher Barry was appointed to direct the serial. Lambert's original choice for director was Richard Martin, but Wilson wanted Barry to remain in charge. However, Barry's other work commitments led to a compromise by the production team: Barry would direct the early episodes of the serial, and Martin would trail him to gain more experience. The serial went through a number of working titles during production, including The Survivors and Beyond the Sun, before settling as The Mutants towards the end of production."]}, {"page": "Marco Polo (Doctor Who)", "response": ["Mark Eden was cast as Marco Polo; Hussein had seen Eden in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of A Penny for a Song in 1962.

For the role of Ping-Cho, Hussein wanted an \"oriental\" actress who had not appeared in the West End production of The World of Suzie Wong or the film 55 Days at Peking (1963), due to the prominence of those productions. Actress Zienia Merton auditioned at Hussein's home, and was offered the role. William Russell was unhappy with sudden rewrites minimising the role of his character, Ian Chesterton, in the serial, and his agent wrote to BBC's head of serials Donald Wilson; Wilson replied to Russell's agent, assuring that he would \"be watching very carefully\" to ensure the scripts \"use [Russell's] talents to the maximum\".

In June 1964, head of serials Donald Wilson considered continuing the show without the character of Barbara, and with a younger actress for Susan. Delays by Controller of Programmes Donald Baverstock to renew cast contracts meant that Susan's replacement, then intended to be Jenny (originally known as Saida), could not be introduced in the serial.

This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and like nothing that had been seen on television before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation's script by her direct superior Donald Wilson but used the excuse that they had nothing else ready to produce it.

O'Brien refused, saying, \"Why don't you just get Carole Ann Ford back?\" O'Brien had just come out of drama school when she was cast as Vicki; it was her first television acting job. Barry originally offered the role of Bennett to Bernard Archard, but he was unavailable. Ray Barrett was cast in the role, described as a \"Jekyll and Hyde character\". Barry had seen Barrett on television and noted his name due to his rugged face, and \"dug him out of the book\" when the time came. Barrett played Bennett as a \"normal, straight human being\" so as not to give the ending away. To preserve the mystery, Koquillion was credited in the first episode as being played by \"Sydney Wilson\", a name made up by the production team in tribute to two of the creators of Doctor Who, Sydney Newman and Donald Wilson. When designing Koquillion, costume designer Daphne Dare took inspiration from a close-up of a fly. Tom Sheridan was cast to play the voice of the rescue ship, the sand creature, and a robed figure; an agreement was made for him to be credited as 'Space Captain', which meant he could not portray the robed figure."]}, {"page": "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series", "response": ["| Ken Riddington, executive producer; Joan Sullivan, series producer; Donald Wilson, producer"]}, {"page": "The First Churchills", "response": ["The First Churchills is a BBC serial from 1969 about the life of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and his wife, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.
