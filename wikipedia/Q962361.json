One of the four paintings in the Pitt Rivers Museum collection done by Maung Maiung Gyi is an exact replica of a painting entitled Express Steamer Passing Sagaing on page 146 of Talbot Kelly\u2019s book. This is not to suggest by any means that Maung Maung Gyi had a habit of copying works from other painters; rather, as many painters of both the Traditional and Western Schools did in Burma in the early days, he copied the works of painters he admired in order to learn.", "* Robert Talbot Kelly"]}, {"page": "M.T.

Hla almost certainly knew of the works of Robert Talbot Kelly (1861\u20131934), who had traveled to Burma a few years before Gerald Kelly  and who published the book Burma Painted and Described with over 70 reproductions of his watercolors. The occasional watercolor by M.T, Hla has emerged which appears to have been inspired by images in Talbot Kelly's book, a point to be expected as Talbot Kelly's book was widely disseminated in Burma and became a kind of manual of watercolor style for early Burmese painters attempting to learn Western painting. Two other early Burmese artists in the Western style, for example, Ba Ohn (c.1877-fl. 1924) and Maung Maung Gyi (1890\u20131942) learned painting by copying images from Talbot Kelly's book.", "* Robert Talbot Kelly"]}, {"page": "Saya Myit", "response": ["His father died before he had finished his schooling, and his mother sent him to Saya Nyan (not to be confused with Ba Nyan) to study pavilion decoration. By the age of 16, he had fair mastery of this art. He later studied under the professional painter M.T. Hla (U Tun Hla) (1874\u20131946), who had a background in Traditional art, but who became a pioneer watercolorist of Burma, mastering Western techniques of painting. M.T. Hla picked up these skills through exposure to paintings by Robert Talbot Kelly in his book Burma Painted and Described, or postcards of the paintings from this book which were sold in stores. Hla also had contact and instruction of some kind with the Irish painter Sir Gerald Kelly; both Kellys traveled to Burma in the early 1900s and painted its landscapes and people. Thus, M.T. Hla would likely have trained Saya Myit in both the Traditional and Western style of painting. M.T. Hla was also considered a master of glass painting and apparently passed on these skills to Saya Myit although it seems no works in the glass painting genre have survived by either M.T. Hla or Saya Myit."]}, {"page": "List of Orientalist artists", "response": ["* Robert Talbot Kelly (British, 1861\u20131943)Davies, K., Orientalists: Western Artists in Arabia, the Sahara, Persia and India, New York, Laynfaroh, 2005, pp 87\u201389"]}, {"page": "Richard Talbot Kelly", "response": ["Talbot Kelly was born in Birkenhead, then in Cheshire, England, on 20 August 1896.
