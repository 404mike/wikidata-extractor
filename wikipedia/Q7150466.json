The two handsome Thorolfs (\u00de\u00f3r\u00f3lfrs) die heroic deaths, while their brothers Skallagrim and Egil both die in old age after spitefully burying their wealth in the wilderness.  The descendants of Kveld\u00falfr find themselves involved in two complicated inheritance feuds, at one time rejecting the claims of illegitimate children of a second marriage, and at another time claiming land on behalf of another illegitimate child born to similar circumstances.\"At the root of the first half of the Saga are two family conflicts which extend far beyond the domestic issues which give rise to them, and lead ultimately to enmities with the royal household of Norway.  These cases both begin with a man of wealth and power who marries twice, one of the two marriages being in some way of doubtful legality, and illustrate the effect upon the family of the two conflicting lines of descent.\" - Hermann P\u00e1lsson and Paul Edwards translation, Penguin Classics, 1976"]}, {"page": "Olaudah Equiano", "response": ["Following publication in 1967 of a newly edited version of his memoir by Paul Edwards, interest in Equiano revived.
