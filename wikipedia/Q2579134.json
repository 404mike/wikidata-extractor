They were undertaken by William Burke and William Hare, who sold the corpses to Robert Knox for dissection at his anatomy lectures.\nEdinburgh was a leading European centre of anatomical study in the early 19th century, in a time when the demand for cadavers led to a shortfall in legal supply. Scottish law required that corpses used for medical research should only come from those who had died in prison, suicide victims, or from foundlings and orphans. The shortage of corpses led to an increase in body snatching by what were known as \"resurrection men\". Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed\u2014such as the use of mortsafes\u2014exacerbated the shortage. When a lodger in Hare's house died, Hare turned to his friend Burke for advice and they decided to sell the body to Knox. They received what was, for them, the generous sum of \u00a37 10s. A little over two months later, when Hare was concerned that a lodger suffering from fever would deter others from staying in the house, he and Burke murdered her and sold the body to Knox. The men continued their murder spree, probably with the knowledge of their wives. Burke and Hare's actions were uncovered after other lodgers discovered their last victim, Margaret Docherty, and contacted the police.\nA forensic examination of Docherty's body indicated she had probably been suffocated, but this could not be proven. Although the police suspected Burke and Hare of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven\u2014a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards; his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as at 2021, it remains.\nThe murders raised public awareness of the need for bodies for medical research and contributed to the passing of the Anatomy Act 1832. The events have made appearances in literature, and been portrayed on screen, either in heavily fictionalised accounts, or as the inspiration for fictional works.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Asphyxia", "response": ["In homicidal cases, the term burking is often ascribed to a killing method that involves simultaneous smothering and compression of the torso. The term \"burking\" comes from the method William Burke and William Hare used to kill their victims during the West Port murders. They killed the usually intoxicated victims by sitting on their chests and suffocating them by putting a hand over their nose and mouth, while using the other hand to push the victim's jaw up. The corpses had no visible injuries, and were supplied to medical schools for money."]}, {"page": "Kilkeel", "response": ["The town is also known as the location where the 19th-century serial killer William Hare died."]}, {"page": "William Hare", "response": ["William Hare may refer to:", "*William Hare (author) (born 1942), American writer", "*William Hare (murderer) (1792 or 1804 - after 1829), Irish criminal, member of the infamous Edinburgh duo of Burke and Hare", "*William Hare (philosopher) (born 1944), English academic, professor of education and philosophy in Halifax, Nova Scotia since 1970", "*William Hare (sport shooter) (1935\u20132005), Canadian Olympic sports shooter", "*William Hare, 1st Earl of Listowel (1751\u20131837), Irish peer and Member of Parliament", "*William Hare, 2nd Earl of Listowel (1801\u20131856), grandson of the 1st Earl, peer and Member of Parliament", "*William Hare, 3rd Earl of Listowel (1833\u20131924), son of the 2nd Earl, Baron Hare, Liberal politician ", "*William Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel (1906\u20131997), grandson of the 3rd Earl, Labour politician"]}, {"page": "Crime Classics", "response": ["A roster of Hollywood radio actors filled the various historical roles.
