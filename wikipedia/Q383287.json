(\"Vado Aureo\" is a Latinized form of Guildford, in Surrey.) His work, Tractatus de armis, written at the behest of the late Anne of Bohemia (died 1394), consort of Richard II, appeared first in a Latin manuscript that is conventionally dated from the wording of the dedication c.1395. It was widely circulated, and translated into English and Welsh. Its main rival among Latin tractates in the field of heraldry was De Officio Militari by Nicholas Upton (1454), which treated heraldry in the larger context of the arts of war. Both works depend on the first work of heraldic jurisprudence, De Insigniis et Armiis, which was written by a professor of law at the University of Padua, Bartolus de Saxoferato, (Bartolo of Sassoferrato), in the 1350s.\nJohannes broke with previous tradition in denying the right of a man-at-arms to assume a coat of arms.\nSir Edward Bysshe published both treatises as Nicholai Vptoni, de Stvdio Militari, Libri Quatuor, Johan. de Bado Aureo, Tractatus de Armis (London, 1654).\nProfessor Evan J. Jones, Medieval Heraldry: Some Fourteenth Century Heraldic Works  (Cardiff: William Lewis, Ltd.) 1943, suggested that  \"Johannes de Bado Aureo\" may have been Bishop Sion Trevor, an ecclesiastic who was trained in Roman law, and rose through the Church hierarchy to become Bishop of St Asaph, Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abatement (heraldry)", "response": ["The earliest mention in heraldic writing of a dishonorable display of arms (and, according to Fox-Davies, the only one reliably attested in actual use; see historical examples below) was inverting the entire shield, first documented by Johannes de Bado Aureo in his heraldic treatise Tractatus de armis (c. 1394).  Contemporary accounts of executions for treason describe the traitor being marched to his execution in a paper tabard displaying his inverted arms, and other accounts tell of displaying the inverted arms of prisoners, released on parole, who refuse to pay their ransom."]}, {"page": "Or (heraldry)", "response": ["* Of virtues, FaithSee the table in Woodcock & Robinson (1988), p. 54, compiled from G. Leigh's Accedence of Armory (1562) and Sir John Ferne's The Glory of Generositie (1586). or obedience and gentilityWoodcock & Robinson (1988), p. 54, attributed to Johannes de Bado Aureo."]}, {"page": "White Book of Hergest", "response": ["In addition to several poems by Lewys Glyn Cothi and a number by other poets, the manuscript was known to contain a large number of works by Dafydd ap Gwilym, although all of these seem either to have been copied by John Davies or survive in variants in other manuscripts.Johnston, D. The Manuscript Tradition, dafyddapgwilym.net It also contained many prose and historical texts, including a copy of the Laws of Hywel Dda which contained several passages found in no other version. Lewys Glyn Cothi's interest in heraldry was reflected by the inclusion of pedigrees and other genealogical and heraldic materials such as the Llyfr Arfau, the \"Book of Arms\", ascribed to a John Trevor or Johannes de Bado Aureo, who may be one of several historical figures.The White Book text was the earliest recorded version of the Llyfr Arfau, and along with some accompanying tracts may be the major loss resulting from the manuscript's destruction, though a heavily corrupted version of this text survives in British Museum, Stowe MS. 669; see Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, 1944, 200 Not all of the White Book's contents had been copied at the time of its destruction and some were irretrievably lost."]}]}}
