He was loaned to KuPS in 1990, before becoming a regular player in the Brentford side under new manager Phil Holder in 1990\u201391, when the Bees qualified for the playoffs but lost to eventual promotion winners Tranmere Rovers in the semi finals. He played 33 games in the Third Division that season, scoring six goals. He was a key part in their Third Division title success for the 1991\u201392 season, scoring 6 goals in 38 games to give Brentford a place in the new First Division, as the old Second Division would be known from the start of the 1992\u201393 campaign due to the creation of the FA Premier League. The 1992\u201393 season looked as though it would be a successful one for the Bees, who entered the new year in 10th place and on the brink of the playoff zone, with all the talk at Griffin Park being about a second successive promotion and top division football for the first time since 1947. However, a collapse in the second half of the season saw the Bees relegated. Gayle initially remained loyal to the Bees, but on 24 March 1994 he linked up with his old Brentford striker partner Gary Blissett in a \u00a3250,000 move to Wimbledon, who were in the process of finishing a creditable sixth place in the Premier League. In May 2015, Gayle was inducted into the Brentford Hall of Fame."]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 in English football", "response": ["17 May 1993 \u2013 Six days after leaving Chelsea, David Webb is named as the new manager of Brentford, in place of Phil Holder after the West London club's relegation from Division One."]}, {"page": "Dean Holdsworth", "response": ["He was to prove himself as a prolific goalscorer for the \"Bees\", as the club moved from 13th in 1989\u201390 to the play-offs in 1990\u201391, before Holdsworth scored 38 goals in the Third Division championship winning season of 1991\u201392, in a fruitful partnership with Gary Blissett.
