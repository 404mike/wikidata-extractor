He campaigned against corruption in jury selection, for penal reform, for the abolition of capital punishment, and for universal suffrage.\nPearson used his influence as City Solicitor to promote improvements to transport communications. Initially, he proposed a central railway station for the City, accessed by tunnel, that would be used by multiple railway companies enabling workers to commute to the City from further away.  When this plan was rejected, Pearson promoted an underground railway connecting the capital's northern termini. The resulting Metropolitan Railway was the first underground railway in the world and led to the development of the extensive London Underground network and the rapid expansion of the capital.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London Underground", "response": ["* Charles Pearson (1793\u20131862) suggested an underground railway in London in 1845 and from 1854 promoted a scheme that eventually became the Metropolitan Railway."]}, {"page": "October 4", "response": ["*1793 \u2013 Charles Pearson, English lawyer and politician (d. 1862)"]}, {"page": "September 14", "response": ["*1862 \u2013 Charles Pearson, English lawyer and politician (b. 1793)"]}, {"page": "Victorian era", "response": ["Member of Parliament and Solicitor to the City of London Charles Pearson campaigned for an underground rail service in London.

A bill was published in November 1852 and in January 1853 the directors held their first meeting and appointed John Fowler as its engineer.

The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its services and acquiring other local railways north and west of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819\u20131901) was appointed its Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he had a vision of unifying a string of railways to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin entered negotiations to take control of the A&B and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury and the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a through route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London at this time were poor: although still an extremely roundabout route, this scheme would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic, and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm of Watkin and the Duke, and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected.

The foundation stone of this building had been laid on 28 June 1838, but, Elmes being successful in a competition for the Assize Courts in the same city, it was finally decided to include the hall and courts in a single building. Consequently, Elmes prepared a fresh design, and construction work commenced in 1841.

By 1850 there were seven railway termini located around the urban centre of London and the concept of an underground railway linking the City of London with these stations was first proposed in the 1830s. Charles Pearson, Solicitor to the City of London, was a leading promoter of several schemes, and he contributed to the creation of the City Terminus Company to build such a railway from Farringdon to King's Cross in 1852. Although the plan was supported by the City of London, the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed. In 1854 the Metropolitan Railway (also known as the Met) was granted permission to build an underground line at an estimated cost of \u00a31\u00a0million.   With the Crimean War under way, the Met found it hard to raise the capital, and construction did not start until March 1860. The railway was mostly built using the \"cut-and-cover\" method from Paddington to King's Cross; east of King's Cross it was built by tunnelling and then followed the culverted River Fleet in an open cutting to the new meat market at Smithfield. The  railway opened to the public on 10 January 1863, using steam locomotives hauling wooden carriages. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. In the first twelve months 9.5\u00a0million passengers were carried and in the second twelve months this increased to 12\u00a0million."]}, {"page": "London station group", "response": ["The first London terminal stations were built in the late 1830s (starting with London Bridge in 1836) and the early to mid 1840s.

The solicitor and railway planner Charles Pearson proposed a main central station at , which would connect out to all branch lines. In 1846, the Royal Commission on Metropolitan Railway Termini was established to see if it was appropriate to bring the terminal stations any further and possibly connect with each other, as per Pearson's plans.
