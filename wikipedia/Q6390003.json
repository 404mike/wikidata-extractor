Cracknell (born 19 June 1935) is a British specialist in interfaith dialogue and the Christian theology of religions.\nCracknell has written many articles and books on interfaith dialogue and other subjects, including Towards a New Relationship (1985), Justice Courtesy and Love (1994), An Introduction to World Methodism (2005), and In Good and Generous Faith (2005). A festschrift, A Great Commission (2000) edited by Martin Forward, Stephen Plant and Susan White, includes scholarly articles by numerous friends and colleagues on the occasion of Cracknell's 65th birthday.  He has pioneered a sensitive and respectful Christian approach to the religious Other while dealing skillfully with Bible verses that for some demand a total condemnation of other religions and the conversion of their followers.  Wesley S. Ariarajah, former director of inter-religions relations at the World Council of Churches describes Cracknell's discussion as \"a probing exegesis of the apparently exclusive verses.\"  \nDefining mission as witnessing to the compassionate presence of God in the world modeled by the life and suffering of Jesus Christ, Cracknell does not reject conversion from one faith to another but is more concerned with movement towards a deeper relationship with God and with loving action in God's world to reduce pain, poverty and prejudice. His Justice, Courtesy and Love examines the contributions of Christian scholars including missionaries whose encounter with the religious Other deepened their own understanding of the nature of God's concern for the restoration of human and planetary health. His career included pioneering the interfaith relations work of the British Council of Churches, teaching at University of Cambridge and at Brite Divinity School, Texas from where he retired in 2007 as Distinguished Professor of Theology and Global Studies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shaunaka Rishi Das", "response": ["But we Christians may also recognise a new factor, namely that ISKCON is the first global Vaisnava movement that is just now coming to understand its vocation to enable Westerners to understand Indian philosophy and spirituality.Cracknell Kenneth, ISKCON and Interfaith Dialogue,ISKCON Communications Journal, Vol 8, No 1 June 2000 \u2014 Rev.

As moderator Thompson also sat on the council's general committee. On taking up his appointment as Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1989 he stepped down from the committee and was succeeded as moderator by David Silk, Archdeacon of Leicester (later Bishop of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia). Thompson was also co-chair of the Inter-Faith Network for the United Kingdom from its formation in 1987 until 1992. He enjoyed an excellent relationship with leading members of the various faith communities, not least of all with his co-chair, Holocaust survivor and fellow Thought for the Day presenter, Rabbi Hugo Gryn and with Zaki Badawi, Chair of the Imam and Mosques Council. Interfaith relations were becoming increasingly important in Britain's multi religious and multi cultural society. The Salman Rushdie affair, the 1988 Education Act's clauses on school worship and religious education and the first Gulf War were among the many issues on the CROPOF agenda under Thompson's leadership."]}, {"page": "Clinton Bennett", "response": ["Clinton Bennett (born 7 October 1955) is a British-American scholar of religions and participant in interfaith dialogue specialising in the study of Islam and Muslim-non-Muslim encounter.
