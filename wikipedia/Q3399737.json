However, while doing so, Davis fell on his back and landed on the line. Umpire Eddie Phillipson ruled that Davis had carried the ball over the boundary and signalled six. Sobers then smashed the next ball - the sixth ball of the over - clean over the East Terrace of the St. Helen's Cricket Ground. As commentator Wilf Wooller put it: \"And he\u2019s done it! He\u2019s done it! And my goodness, it\u2019s gone ... way down to Swansea!\" Sobers was playing as captain of Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan at St. Helen's in Swansea; the unfortunate bowler was Malcolm Nash. This tally of 36 runs in an over broke a 57-year-old record of 34 runs, held by Ted Alletson. The ball was collected from a garden by 11-year-old Richard Lewis; he later gave the ball to Sobers.
