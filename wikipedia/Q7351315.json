He served with the Royal Army Service Corps during First World War and achieved the rank of captain in 1917 and Brevet-Major in 1919. In 1922 he was elected to the House of Commons for South Dorset, a seat he held until 1929. His father had been intended for a peerage in 1916 but died before the patent was completed. In the 1929 Dissolution Honours Yerburgh was raised to the peerage as Baron Alvingham, of Woodfold in the County Palatine of Lancaster.\nLord Alvingham married, firstly, his first cousin Dorothea Gertrude, daughter of John Eardley Yerburgh, in 1911. They had one son and two daughters. After her death in 1927 he married, secondly, Maud Lytton Grey Morgan, daughter of Charles Ford Morgan (an actor known professionally as Lytton Grey), in 1936. They had no children. Lord Alvingham died in November 1955, aged 65, and was succeeded in the barony by his only son Robert.

Risdon was working as a political organiser for the Labour Party and, in 1924, he was selected as Labour candidate for the South Dorset constituency in the October general election. South Dorset was a staunchly-Conservative constituency, and Risdon was defeated by the incumbent, Major Robert Yerburgh, 1st Baron Alvingham.Craig, F. W. S. (1983). British parliamentary election results 1918-1949 (3 ed.). Chichester: Parliamentary Research Services. . One of the factors contributing to the defeat of Ramsay MacDonald's ten-month minority government was the Zinoviev letter. Risdon went back to his organising work in the south west of England, but he also started cultivating links with Birmingham, most probably because the then regional organiser, J H Edwards, was replaced in 1924 by Clem Jones, previously the divisional Labour Party agent in Smethwick.Worley, Matthew, ed. Labour's Grass Roots: Essays on the Activities of Local Labour Parties and Members, 1918\u201345 One of those links was with Fircroft College, \"a residential college for working men\" and so, as well as meeting his future wife at one of the socialist summer schools in the Birmingham area, he also encountered for the first time his future colleague, mentor and employer, Oswald Mosley, most probably at the 1925 Independent Labour Party (ILP) Easter Conference in Gloucester. Mosley, a recent convert to socialism, was determined to dislodge one of the highest profile members of the \"Birmingham Caucus\",Tholfsen, Trygve R. \"The Origins of the Birmingham Caucus\", Louisiana State University, New Orleans; The Historical Journal, II, 2 (1959), p. 161 Neville Chamberlain. He was only narrowly defeated at Ladywood, Birmingham, in the 1924 election, and that aspiration had to take second place to his desire to return to Parliament, which he was able to do in 1926 albeit in an adjacent constituency, Smethwick. There is no specific evidence that Risdon helped with this campaign, but his close association with Mosley at the time is generally acknowledged."]}, {"page": "Yerburgh", "response": ["*Robert Yerburgh, 1st Baron Alvingham (1889\u20131955), British politician, son of Robert Armstrong Yerburgh"]}, {"page": "Oswald Wardell-Yerburgh", "response": ["Wardell-Yerburgh, who was the son and grandson of clergymen, had ten full brothers and sisters: Richard Eustre, Susan Edith, John Eardley, Robert Armstrong, Mary Florence, Edmond Rochfort, Rachel, Harry Beauchamp, Lucy Isabel, and Charlotte Elizabeth.
