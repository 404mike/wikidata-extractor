In a 1969 review of another book, Robert G. Chambers noted that there were not many textbooks covering these topics, as \"since 1953, Kittel's classic Introduction to Solid State Physics has dominated the field so effectively that few competitors have appeared\", noting that the third edition continues that legacy. Before continuing, the reviewer noted that the book was too long for some uses and that less thorough works would be welcome. "]}]}}
