He was the Member of Parliament MP for Ebbw Vale.Born in Beaufort, Davies began working as a coal miner when he was twelve years old.  He became active in the Ebbw Vale and Sirhowy Colliery Workmen's Association, then later became full-time agent for its successor, the Ebbw Vale District of the South Wales Miners' Federation.Davies was a supporter of the Labour Party, for which he was returned unopposed as a Member of Parliament at the 1920 Ebbw Vale by-election.  He retained the seat at the 1922 and 1923 elections, and was unopposed in 1924, retaining it until 1929, but developed a bad reputation for failing to attend local meetings, and even the House of Commons itself.  In March 1927, Stanley Baldwin, the Prime Minister, visited his constituency to express sympathy for miners killed in a pit explosion, and was received with hostility because of his actions during the General Strike. Davies created great unpopularity by apologising to Baldwin for the conduct of 'a few irresponsible youths'.The local supporters of Aneurin Bevan successfully sought Davies's deselection, and he was obliged to stand down in 1929.  Bevan succeeded him, and retained the seat until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aneurin Bevan", "response": ["In 1928, Bevan won a seat on Monmouthshire County Council in the Tredegar Central Division. He lost the seat in 1931, but regained it in 1932 before deciding against seeking re-election in 1934. With his success in 1928, he was picked as the Labour Party candidate for Ebbw Vale (displacing the sitting MP Evan Davies), and easily held the seat at the 1929 General Election. Bevan gained more than twice the votes of Liberal candidate William Griffiths, receiving 20,000 votes to Griffiths' 8,000. In keeping with his background, Bevan described his initial thoughts on the House of Commons as a shrine to \"the most conservative of all religions \u2013 ancestor worship\".  In Parliament, he became noticed as a harsh critic of those he felt opposed the working man and woman. His targets included the Conservative Winston Churchill and the Liberal David Lloyd George, as well as Ramsay MacDonald and Margaret Bondfield from his own Labour party (he targeted the latter for her unwillingness to increase unemployment benefits). He had solid support from his constituency, being one of the few Labour MPs to be unopposed in the 1931 General Election, and this support grew through the 1930s and the period of the Great Depression."]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Evan Davies, Ebbw Vale, 1920-1929 "]}, {"page": "1960 in Wales", "response": ["*22 December \u2013 Evan Davies, politician, 85"]}, {"page": "Evan Davies", "response": ["Evan Davies or Davis may refer to:", "* Evan Davies (missionary) (1805\u20131864), Welsh Protestant Christian missionary", "* Evan Davies (rugby), rugby union and rugby league footballer of the 1910s and 1920s", "* Evan Davies (Ebbw Vale MP) (1875\u20131960), Welsh Member of Parliament for Ebbw Vale, 1920\u20131929", "* Evan Davies (educationalist) (1826\u20131872), Welsh educationalist", "* Evan Davies (Calvinistic Methodist minister) (1842\u20131919), Welsh Calvinistic Methodist minister, and writer", "* Evan Davies (Independent minister) (1750\u20131806), Welsh Independent minister", "* Evan Davies (almanac-maker), Welsh philomath and almanac-maker", "* Evan Davies, cinematographer and film producer", "* Evan Davies (New South Wales politician) (1889\u20131948), Australian politician born in Wales", "* Evan Davies (Western Australian politician) (1892\u20131963), Australian politician"]}, {"page": "1907 Glamorgan County Council election", "response": ["This was a fierce contest between Evan Davies, solicitor to the local miners' union and described by opponents as the Federation candidate and J.P.
