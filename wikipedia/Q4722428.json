Under the captaincy of Charles Lewis, Bowen was one of three Llanelli players chosen for the game, and along with teammates Alfred Cattell and Thomas Judson became the first player to represent Llanelli at international level. The game was a one sided affair, with England victorious, though the Welsh play was of a higher standard than the first encounter between the teams. The next game of the tournament was an away match to Scotland, and Wales experimented with one full-back player for the first time.Godwin (1984), p.2 Bowen was one of the full-backs, paired for the England game with captain Lewis, the selectors favoured Lewis, and Bowen was dropped."]}]}}
