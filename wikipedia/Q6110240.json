His first goal for Colchester arrived towards the end of August in the third game of the season, as his late equaliser salvaged a 1\u20131 draw for the U's; their third successive draw to start the season. He celebrated the goal by running the length of the pitch with his hands cupped behind his ears to taunt the Sheffield United fans who, throughout the game, had been doing likewise to the striker for his connections with their city rivals, Wednesday. Joe Dunne took over as the U's boss at the end of September and immediately brought in Jabo Ibehre on loan from Milton Keynes Dons, with the loanee displacing Morrison from the starting eleven and consigning him to the bench.  Dunne's fourth game in charge was a Football League Trophy defeat to Northampton Town where Morrison was handed a start, but he was dismissed for violent conduct in the closing stages of the game which would suspend the striker for three matches after the club decided against appealing his ban. The impressive form of Ibehre ensured that Morrison only started four more games for the U's until March, when injury to Freddie Sears created a hole in attack. This was coupled with Ibehre receiving a three-match suspension and Morrison went on to spearhead the U's attack once more, providing crucial experience in Colchester's bid for League One survival. In his fourth successive start, he notched his second U's goal in a 2\u20131 win away at Bury; a vital match-winning goal in a crunch relegation fixture.
