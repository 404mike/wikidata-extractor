Shortly after Humphreys signed a new contract with the club, much to the dismay of Cambridge fans who wanted him to stay and described him as \"a big loss\". Humphreys started the 2001\u201302 season partnering Kevin Henderson up front for the first 9 league matches. However, after a bad run Humphreys was dropped and replaced by new signing Gordon Watson. However, Humphreys would soon be back in  the team and replace Henderson to partner Watson, these two players were already familiar with each other from their days at Sheffield Wednesday. Despite not scoring many goals manager Turner was pleased with his performances. Humphreys was then moved into central midfield due to the injury of Tommy Widdrington and after impressing played there for the remainder of the season. Humphreys' first season at the club would end in disappointment as he missed the decisive penalty in the play-off semi-final defeat to Cheltenham Town, which cost Hartlepool a place in the Second Division. The penalty struck the woodwork twice and stayed out. After his miss Humphreys was devastated but he was cheered up by Chris Turner and the players who rang him and told him to keep his head up. Humphreys also received many letters of support from the Hartlepool fans."]}, {"page": "Craig Farrell (footballer)", "response": ["Farrell was born in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, where he grew up and attended Beechwood First School as a child.

I've only started one game this season in the LDV. I've got to keep working as hard as I can and make sure when my chance comes I take it.\" He was released by Carlisle in May 2005, along with teammates Kevin Henderson, Carlos Roca, Brian Shelley and Chris Beech."]}, {"page": "List of people from Northumberland", "response": ["* Kevin Henderson (born 1974), played for Hartlepool United"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|||FW|| Kevin Henderson || Hartlepool United || Free || 11 June 1999"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["||FW|| Kevin Henderson || Morpeth Town || Free || 1 December 1997"]}, {"page": "Kevin Henderson", "response": ["Kevin Henderson may refer to:", "* Kevin Henderson (footballer) (born 1974), English footballer ", "* Kevin Henderson (ice hockey) (born 1986), Canadian ice hockey player ", "* Kevin Henderson (rugby league) (born 1981), British rugby league footballer", "* Kevin Henderson (basketball) (born 1964), American basketball player"]}, {"page": "2001 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["Blackpool's opponents in their play-off semi-final were Hartlepool United with the first match of the two-legged tie taking place at Bloomfield Road in Blackpool on 13 May 2001.
