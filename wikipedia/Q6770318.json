Some, like-minded, had come through the offices of modernists such as Ove Arup and Felix Samuely, who believed in 'total design' an earlier term for 'multi-disciplinary' design. In addition, a small group of sympathetic structural engineers, including Frank Newby, Anthony Hunt, Ted Happold, Mark Whitby and Peter Rice, became essential to the development of the movement. As a result of the symbiotic association between architects and engineers, a freedom of design evolved away from the constraints of the everyday. Aside from the architectural and engineering impetus, there was a wider cultural involvement as the principal proponents shared friendships centred upon art, writing and industrial design. Most operated as freelancers working in small studio home offices which became their calling-cards identifying with the High Tech style.", "*Mark Whitby (b. 1950) Worked, early in his career, for Anthony Hunt Associates and Buro Happold", "| Patera Building|| 1982 Stoke-on-Trent UK || Michael Hopkins Architects/John Pringle/Anthony Hunt Associates/Mark Whitby/Longton Industrial Holdings Plc || Structural Steel Design Award 1983 commendation Original prototype moved to London Docklands in 1984 and moved again c1989 to Albert Island in the Royal Docks area of East London"]}]}}
