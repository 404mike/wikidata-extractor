Prior to this, she was the dance captain of Encore Dance Studios but left there because she did not have any friends. She arrives at The Next Step in the hope of making friends and instantly becomes best friends with Richelle. She is originally happy to get the solo in a routine being choreographed by Eldon but is then embarrassed when she realises that he mistook Jacquie for her. However, Jacquie comforts Lola and motivates her to work harder. When TNS East and TNS West merge, Lola helps Richelle with her dance captain campaign. When Richelle loses her position, Lola attempts to comfort her, but is antagonized by Richelle, who angrily accuses her of being the reason that she lost. Lola tries to rationalise the situation, leaving Richelle to proclaim she is no longer her friend and storm out of the room. After learning about Richelle's hip injury, she urges Richelle to tell somebody, but is coerced into keeping her injury a secret. When asking Heather advice for what to do, Lola is mistaken for being the injured one. When Richelle refuses to confess, Lola comes to realise that Richelle is being selfish. With no other ways to get through to her, Lola breaks the shank of Richelle's pointe shoe. This results in Lola losing her close friendship to Richelle."]}, {"page": "Find Me in Paris", "response": ["* Jessica Lord as Lena Grisky"]}, {"page": "Party of Five (2020 TV series)", "response": ["* Jessica Lord as Alice, a young mother"]}]}}
