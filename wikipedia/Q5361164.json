It did not however make the road to publication any easier.  When Butler submitted the manuscript to the respectable and long-established house of Longman, who had in recent years become his regular publishers, they rejected it for fear of offending their High Church clientele, even when Butler offered to pay the costs himself.  On March 24, 1901 he wrote to George Bernard Shaw, conceding that the book was \"far more wicked than Erewhon\", and asking for his advice.Henry Festing Jones Samuel Butler: A Memoir (Whitefish, Montana: Kessenger, 2004) vol. 2, p. 339.

Dr. Robert Herbert Brabant of Devizes introduced the book to David Strauss, author of Das Leben Jesu, and the Inquiry was translated into German (1839): Strauss wrote it a preface. Elinor Shaffer argues that Hennell was familiar, as was common enough in rational dissenter circles going back to Priestley, with some German theologians, but largely limited (as Strauss wrote) to works in Latin; and that his writing was not in those terms so innovative as to justify the weight sometimes given it as an influence on George Eliot.Elinor Shaffer, Kubla Khan and the Fall of Jerusalem, pp. 230\u20132."]}, {"page": "John Davies (poet, born 1944)", "response": ["Much of Davies' work has been concerned with roots, language and belonging,: \"His work has been praised for its formal precision and for its marriage of delicate lyricism with intellectual toughness.

He also tells us that his wife and daughter speak Welsh, but he does not.  It\u2019s the first poem in his 1985 collection, The Visitor\u2019s Book.
