There is no real evidence either way.  But what can be said is that he made it his own and he was in the habit of adding new verses and removing old verses as it suited him. These verses may have been written by himself or by others for him, and usually had no connection with the original theme. There are several other versions of the song. One version was popular just over the border in Southern Scotland and of which Rabbie Burns, for one, knew  and in 1796 wrote a satirical piece, Buy Braw Troggin, set to the tune. Another version, The Besom Maker or Green Besoms, although it shares a refrain with this song, is otherwise quite different (the Roud Index assigns it number 910) and can be seen, as The Besom Maker, at Bodleian Library Broadside Ballads."]}, {"page": "Blind Willie Purvis", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Purvis (Blind Willie)"]}, {"page": "The Newcassel Worthies", "response": ["* Blind Willie, is William Purvis."]}, {"page": "Thomas Thompson (songwriter)", "response": ["*William Purvis (Blind Willie)"]}, {"page": "Jemmy Joneson's Whurry", "response": ["* Blind Willie was William Purvis the singer and performer"]}, {"page": "Newcassel Props", "response": ["*  Blind Willy (or Blind Willie) was William Purvis"]}, {"page": "A Beuk o' Newcassell Sangs", "response": ["|||Broom Buzzems \u2013 (or Buy Broom Busoms)||William Purvis (Blind Willie)||||actually entitled \"Buy Broom Buzzems\" in this book||||"]}, {"page": "Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings", "response": ["|54||Short bio||William Purvis (Blind Willie)||||||||", "|55||Broom Buzzems \u2013 (or Buy Broom Busoms) ||maybe William Purvis (Blind Willie)||||||||", "|56||Broom Buzzems \u2013 (Extra Verses added by Blind Willie) ||William Purvis (Blind Willie)||||||||", "|57||Tarum Tickle, tan dum \u2013 A Rhyme by Blind Willie||William Purvis (Blind Willie)||||||||", "|188||short bio||William Purvis (Blind Willie)||||||||", "|412||Short bio||William Purvis (Blind Willie)||||||||"]}, {"page": "John Atlantic Stephenson", "response": ["His mother Elizabeth (1804\u20131878), was a daughter of Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Goirdon) and Dr William Brummell, who was featured in several songs, in one William Purvis (Blind Willie) would sing of him and he is mentioned in William Oliver\u2019s \"The Newcassel Props\"."]}, {"page": "John Stokoe", "response": ["In the same book on page 54, Thomas Allan quotes Stokoe from \"The North-Country Garland of Song\u201d giving details of William Purvis (Blind Willie).
