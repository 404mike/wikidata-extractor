Prior to World War II, many major population transfers were the result of bilateral treaties and had the support of international bodies such as the League of Nations. The expulsion of Germans after World War II from Central and Eastern Europe after World War II was sanctioned by the Allies in Article 13 of the Potsdam communiqu\u00e9, but research has shown that both the British and the American delegations at Potsdam strongly objected to the size of the population transfer that had already taken place and was accelerating in the summer of 1945. The principal drafter of the provision, Geoffrey Harrison, explained that the article was intended not to approve the expulsions but to find a way to transfer the competence to the Control Council in Berlin to regulate the flow.Alfred de Zayas, Nemesis at Potsdam, Routledge 1979, Appendix pp. 232\u2013234, and A Terrible Revenge, Macmillan 2006,  pp.86\u201387"]}, {"page": "Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)", "response": ["In late 1945 the Allies requested a temporary halt to the expulsions, due to the refugee problems created by the expulsion of Germans.US Department of State, Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Bureau of Public Affairs, Bureau of Public Affairs: Office of the Historian, Timeline of U.S. Diplomatic History, 1937\u20131945, The Potsdam Conference, 1945, State.gov; accessed 6 December 2014.

On December 16 Stalin reported his plan for German break up to Anthony Eden: Austria would become an independent state again. The British, having no plans for such a distant future, had nothing against this proposal. During 1942\u20131943 the attitude of the Allies to the Austrian question changed: the leaders of the USSR had not suggested any new scheme, while the British took the future of Austria into serious consideration. On September 26, 1942, Eden declared Churchill's plan for the creation of a \"Danube confederation\" composed of Austria, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia \u2013 a vast buffer state that would have separated Western Europe from the USSR. In the Spring of 1943, Geoffrey Harrison, a 34-year-old civil servant in the Foreign Office, developed a plan for the post-war organisation of Austria, which subsequently became the official British policy regarding the Austrian question. Harrison's viewpoint was that recreation of an independent but weak Austria within the borders of the First Republic was only possible with the readiness of the Western allies to support the new state for many years. Harrison did not believe in the ability of the Austrians to self-organize nor in the probability of them rising in armed resistance against the regime. The best solution according to the British point of view would have been a strong confederation of Danube states with Austria included de jure as an equal member, but de facto as a cultural and political leader. It was not possible to create such a union in immediate post-war Europe; an independent Austria would have to be created first, and it would have to be provided with political guarantees and financial support. Only afterward a political union could have been developed step-by-step."]}, {"page": "Sexpionage", "response": ["# Geoffrey Harrison, British ambassador;", "Sir Geoffrey Harrison, British Ambassador to Moscow, was the target of a KGB blackmail attempt in 1968, when they placed an attractive maid named Galya in the diplomatic mission.
