It is estimated that as a result the Treasury is now distributing \u00a340 million less in Road Safety Grant than is raised from fines in the year. Dorset and Essex announced plans to review camera provision with a view to possibly ending the scheme in their counties, however Dorset strongly affirmed its support for the scheme, albeit reducing financial contributions in line with the reduction in government grant. Seven counties also announced plans to turn off some or all of their cameras, amidst warnings from the country's most senior traffic policeman that this would result in an increase in deaths and injuries. Gloucestershire cancelled plans to update cameras and has reduced or cancelled maintenance contracts."]}, {"page": "Rochford", "response": ["*Mike Penning, Conservative MP"]}, {"page": "A14 road (England)", "response": ["In October 2009 the cost estimate had risen to \u00a31.3 billion with work due to start in 2012 and being completed in winter 2015/2016.

The coalition government suspended the scheme when it came into power, with Philip Hammond, the Secretary of State for Transport, suggesting that the scheme would be 'axed', and that the only way it would get built was as a toll road. It was confirmed at the end of October that government money would not pay for the scheme, when Roads Minister Mike Penning said that the scheme was not affordable and no longer offered acceptable value for money.Local Transport Today, issue 557, page 1 The scheme was officially cancelled in 2010.A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon Improvement Scheme , Highways England, accessed 2015-01-03"]}, {"page": "David Amess", "response": ["Amess compiled a pamphlet titled Party of Opportunity with the Renewal Group, which contained thirteen short biographical accounts of Conservative MPs who identify as working class or who come from a working-class background.

Matt Wrack, General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union said that Maude's advice was dangerous and illegal, and could be disastrous in the event of a fire. Brian Madderson, the petrol chairman of the Retail Motor Industry Federation said that the Government appeared to be \"intent on creating a crisis out of a serious concern and that drivers should ignore \"dangerous advice\". Maude denied that it would increase the risk of explosions, however the following day Transport Minister Mike Penning, a former firefighter, confirmed the advice was wrong, saying he didn't think Maude understood how big jerrycans were. On 30 March 2012, the Labour Peer the Lord Harris called for Maude's resignation, after a woman suffered severe burns during an attempt to decant petrol next to a lit gas cooker.
