Alice Margaret Cooke joined his department as a lecturer in 1893.Alice Margaret Cooke, Manchester University, Retrieved 5 January 2016 A sign of both Tout's interest in encouraging women to pursue academic careers and his commitment to primary research is displayed as early as 1902.  In that year, with his colleague James Tait, he edited a volume of \"Manchester Essays\" displaying the scholarly work being done at the new university.  As editors, the two men collected papers from young scholars as well as from some senior Manchester figures.  They included work by several women and--in keeping with a long-term interest of Tout--they published papers on teaching history in the secondary schools. Tout's interest in how history was taught at pre-university levels is also borne out by his many years on the governing board of the Historical Association, with its dedication to bridging the gap between academic research and the teaching of history."]}, {"page": "Wulfwig", "response": ["Wulfwig appears in a charter of 1045 as royal chancellor, but its reliability of doubtful. In 1053 he succeeded Ulf in the bishopric of Dorchester. His predecessor was living and had been irregularly deprived, and Freeman suggests that the record of this fact in the chronicle may indicate some feeling against Wulfwig's appointment, but there seems to have been no opposition. Wulfwig apparently shared the scruple about the canonical position of Archbishop Stigand, for he went abroad to be consecrated. His appointment is thought to mark a momentary decline in Norman influence, and he was the last of the old line of Dorchester bishops, for his death occurred when the English ecclesiastical preferments were passing into Norman hands. His will is extant and is witnessed by a large number of persons, beginning with the king.Alice Margaret Cooke, \"Wulfwig\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 63"]}, {"page": "Alice Cooke", "response": ["#redirect Alice Margaret Cooke"]}, {"page": "Miss A.
