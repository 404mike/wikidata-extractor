Until July 2016, Watson embraced the label \"alt-right\", but he now identifies as part of the new right. In May 2019, Facebook and Instagram permanently banned Watson for violation of hate speech policies.Watson's career emerged through his work for conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones. As editor-at-large of Jones' website InfoWars, he helped promote fake news and advocated for 9/11, chemtrail and New World Order conspiracy theories. Subsequently, reaching a significant audience, both Watson and Jones altered their focus. They now mainly focus on criticizing feminism, Islam, and left-wing politics. Watson also contributes to InfoWars's talk radio program The Alex Jones Show, which he occasionally hosts or co-hosts. Watson has been working at InfoWars since October 2002.Since 2011, Watson has hosted his own YouTube channel, prisonplanetlive, on which he expresses his views on topics such as contemporary society, politics, and modern liberalism in an often mocking manner. He describes his channel as \"Culture, controversy, contrarianism\" and often lampoons celebrities and politicians. As of January 2021, his channel has over 1.9 million subscribers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1982", "response": ["** Paul Joseph Watson, British right-wing YouTuber, radio host, writer and conspiracy theorist"]}, {"page": "Battersea", "response": ["*Paul Joseph Watson \u2013 YouTube personality and radio host"]}, {"page": "UK Independence Party", "response": ["Under the leadership of Henry Bolton, party membership was understood to have fallen to around 18,000 by January 2018.Rayner, Tom, \"UKIP working with alt-right activists to target younger voters\" , Sky News, 6 August 2018 During Batten's interim leadership term, the party avoided insolvency after a financial appeal to members.\"UKIP confirms Gerard Batten as new leader\" , Sky News, 14 April 2018-  As the new permanent leader, Batten focused the party more on opposing Islam, which he described as a \"death cult\", was criticised as an \"explicitly far-right party\" after they invited Paul Joseph Watson as a spokesman, sought closer relations with the far-right activist Tommy Robinson and his followers, and made Muslim-only prisons party policy (which was criticised as \"the first step to Muslim concentration camps\").
