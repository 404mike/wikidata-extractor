He was chosen ahead of Steve Paulding and Paul Sherwen. Keen immediately outlined the focus of the Plan, emphasising that it would mainly be aimed at targeting track cycling due to the large number of Olympic medals on offer. He spent much of the next year developing an eight-year plan to secure longer-term funding: in January 1999 it was announced that British Cycling had secured lottery funding for six years, with an award of \u00a32.5 million for the first year. Later that year, the GB team sprint squad took the first British sprint medal at a World Championship for 40 years at the Berlin Track Worlds."]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Steve Paulding"]}, {"page": "British National Tandem Sprint Championships", "response": ["| 1985 || Michael Borman  Chris Pyatt      ||  Karl McHugh  Paul McHugh || Eddie AlexanderSteve Paulding ", "| 1986 ||  Michael Borman  Chris Pyatt ||  Stewart Brydon  Steve Paulding  || Rob Mitchell  John Saysell", "| 1994||Clayton Velo Peter Boyd  Gary Hibbert ||Leo RC & Stoke AC L Rowe  Martin Phillips  ||City of EdinburghMarco Librizzi Steve Paulding"]}, {"page": "Julie Paulding", "response": ["Paulding is now a development officer for Scottish Cycling.
