Born in Venice to Ambrose Lupo and his first wife Lucia, he and his brother Joseph first went to Antwerp, where Peter joined the musicians' guild on 20 August 1557; He married his first wife Katherine Wicke, and had his first child in Antwerp before moving to England, where Ambrose had served in the royal viol consort since 1540. In 1567, Peter succeeded Albert of Venice, another Italian who had died on 17 January 1555.  Peter Lupo was among the musicians who played at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth in 1603.  His nephew Thomas Lupo the elder and son Thomas Lupo the younger also became court musicians. Another son, Philip, moved to Virginia and became the founder of the American branch of the Lupo family. Among Lupo's descendants in the United States was the Sacred Harp composer Sarah Lancaster, whose father was James Lupo Lancaster.Royal gifts to Peter included \"a payr of perfumed gloves\" and \"v songe books\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1608 in music", "response": ["**Peter Lupo, court musician and composer, son of Ambrose Lupo"]}, {"page": "1555 in music", "response": ["*January 17 \u2013 Italian viol player and composer Peter Lupo joins the musicians' guild in London."]}, {"page": "Sarah Lancaster (composer)", "response": ["Lancaster was born in Talbot County, Georgia, April 28, 1834. Her parents were James Lupo Lancaster and Charity Lancaster, formerly of Edgecombe County, North Carolina. Through her father she was a descendant of the Italian Jewish musician Peter Lupo, who had emigrated to England and was active at the court of Elizabeth I. She had two sisters, Anna Lucinda Maria Atkinson Lancaster, known as \"Ann\", and Priscilla R. Lancaster, known as \"Sid\"; all three were musical, and both others contributed hymns to editions of the Sacred Harp.  All three were students of Benjamin Franklin White and J. P. Reese, the latter of whom assisted them in their compositions.  Sarah studied in Hamilton, Georgia, likely at the Hamilton Female Institute, where she expressed an interest in music and took piano lessons.  It appears that she boarded with White's family during this time in her life; she also developed the habit of sending original compositions to friends and family along with her letters.  She married George Washington \"Wash\" Hagler on November 28, 1866, bearing him five children.  In 1876 the family left Georgia, arriving in Butler, Texas early in 1877.  They remained there until sometime in the 1880s \u2013 they are listed as residents there in the 1880 census \u2013 but by 1886 had moved to Oakwood, Texas; there she died and was buried in the town cemetery.  Lancaster continued to send music home after her move, and would inquire in letters to family about \"the singings\" she had left behind. It was said of her that she was a \"sweet singer\" and \"a Christian woman, of a lovable disposition\"."]}, {"page": "Lupo, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Lupo"]}]}}
