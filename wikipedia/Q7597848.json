In the 2002\u201303 season, Earnshaw scored on the opening day of the season in a 2\u20131 victory over Oldham Athletic but was used largely as a substitute in the opening month after manager Lennie Lawrence opted to play Andy Campbell after Earnshaw failed to score in pre-season. However, on 11 September 2002 he was handed a start against Boston United in the League Cup and scored a hat-trick. He went on to enjoy a prolific season, scoring two further hat-tricks in matches against Queens Park Rangers and Tranmere Rovers and also scored six braces, as Cardiff won promotion to the First Division after defeating Queens Park Rangers in the 2003 Football League Second Division play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium.

Numerous players at the club served during the conflict although reserve team goalkeeper Jackie Pritchard was the only player who perished. Some players, such as Billy James, found that the war left them unable to return to professional football. Several players who had trained in the club's feeder teams during the war went on to form the backbone of the first team on the resumption of the Football League for the 1946\u201347 season. However, Spiers was not around to take part in their success having resigned from his position over a contractual dispute with the board. He had agreed to take a paycut during the war but walked out after the board refused to restore his original contract at the end of hostilities. Billy McCandless was appointed in his stead and, despite suffering defeat against Spiers' new side Norwich City in their opening game, they were crowned as champions of Third Division South after finishing nine points clear of their nearest rivals. Forward Stan Richards scored 30 league goals during the campaign, setting a new club record that stood until 2003.
