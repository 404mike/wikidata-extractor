Hulse rejected the opportunity to move, citing his fondness for club as the reason. It was later revealed that, had the deal gone through, Derby had set up a loan move for Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Sam Vokes as a replacement. An additional striker was eventually brought into the club with the loan signing of Everton youngster James Vaughan until January 2010 on 18 September. Derby increased their defensive options towards the end of the month with the addition of Swedish International right back Fredrik Stoor, who joined on an initial months loan from Premiership side Fulham and Clough revealed the club still has an active interest in young Blackburn goalkeeper Frank Fielding and would make a fresh approach in the January transfer window.
