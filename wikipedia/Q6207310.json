Collier initially joined as player-manager, but was forced to retire from playing due to a broken ankle after two matches. He was in charge for York's last season in the Midland League before their election to the Football League in June 1929. Collier oversaw the club's successful transition from non-League football to the Third Division North, but left the club in May 1930 to become a publican. Billy Sherrington combined his duties as club secretary with that of manager for the next three years, before Collier was reappointed manager in May 1933. With results at a low ebb, he helped York establish themselves in the Football League, and led them to the fourth round of the 1936\u201337 FA Cup. In March 1937, Collier retired from football to go into business with his brother. Former player Tom Mitchell was appointed, and in his first full season led York to the quarter-final of the 1937\u201338 FA Cup."]}, {"page": "List of York City F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*First manager: Jock Collier managed the club for two seasons, which included 105 matches, from July 1928 to May 1930."]}, {"page": "History of York City F.C. (1908\u20131980)", "response": ["For 1924\u201325, the Midland League was reorganised because eight Football League clubs withdrew their reserve teams from the competition. York finished sixth in the Principal Competition that concluded in February 1925 and were runners-up to Denaby United in the North Subsidiary Competition. The club struggled financially in this period, and was only kept going by the enthusiasm and generosity of the directors. John Fisher, one of these benefactors, was elected chairman in 1925. The Midland League was restored to its previous size for 1925\u201326 and York finished in 16th place after a poor start to the season, from which they never recovered. York enjoyed their most successful Midland League season in 1926\u201327, when they finished in sixth place and scored 96 goals in 38 league matches. They surpassed the FA Cup's qualifying rounds for the first time this season, being beaten 2\u20131 by Second Division team Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the second round. In 1927, the club made its first serious attempt for election to the Football League, but Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re-elected instead. Fisher resigned as chairman in August 1927 and Brown took the position for the second time. After ranking seventh in the Midland League in 1927\u201328, York appointed their first official manager in July 1928, with Jock Collier named as player-manager. York finished ninth in 1928\u201329, and Jimmy Cowie was the divisional top scorer with 49 goals. This was York's last season in the Midland League as the club won election to the Football League on 3 June 1929, taking the place of Ashington in the Third Division North."]}, {"page": "John Collier (football manager)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jock Collier"]}, {"page": "John Collier (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jock Collier"]}]}}
