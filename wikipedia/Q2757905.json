His father became wealthy as a speculative builder as well as a building surveyor, allowing William to have a private education. After his father died in 1875, William and his brother inherited this fortune, allowing him to pursue his interest in crystallography without a need to labour for a living.\nWilliam examined the forms of crystalline structures, and deduced that there were only 230 forms of symmetrical crystal arrangements, known as space groups. His results were published in 1894, after they had been independently announced by Evgraf Fedorov and Arthur Sch\u00f6nflies, although his approach did display some novelty. His structural models of simple compounds such as NaCl and CsCl were later confirmed using X-ray crystallography.\nHe served as the president of the English Mineralogical Society from 1915 until 1918.He died in Great Stanmore, Middlesex, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "X-ray crystallography", "response": ["The Danish scientist Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental investigations of crystal symmetry. Steno showed that the angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of a particular type of crystal, and Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Ha\u00fcy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Sch\u00f6nflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; See also    however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive."]}, {"page": "Close-packing of equal spheres", "response": ["There is an uncountably infinite number of disordered arrangements of planes (e.g. ABCACBABABAC...) that are sometimes collectively referred to as \"Barlow packings\", after crystallographer William Barlow"]}, {"page": "Dorsa Barlow", "response": ["Dorsa Barlow is a wrinkle ridge system on the Moon, in Mare Tranquilitatis near the border with Mare Serenitatis, centered at .
