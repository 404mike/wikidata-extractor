Ahmed also engaged Somalia in the Decent Work Program, which aims to protect workers' basic rights as well as develop sustainable employment opportunities, particularly for youth. According to the Prime Minister, the foregoing is part of the broader post-conflict reconstruction process in Somalia, with the government striving to establish an institutional framework facilitating sustainable economic and social development. To this end, Ahmed indicated that his administration was prioritizing the implementation of a Somali-owned state building process for peace, harmonization of the traditional setting, ensuring fully inclusive political engagement and fair access to resources, institutionalization of the promotion and protection of human rights in agreement with the Paris principles, and integration of the National Stabilisation Plan, New Deal Compact, Post Transition Human Rights Road Map, and Decent Work Program. Additionally, Ahmed and his delegation had a working lunch with the ILO Director General Guy Ryder, during which the officials stressed the importance of bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Ahmed subsequently provided a briefing of current developments in Somalia and ongoing operations against Al-Shabaab to Geneva's Friends of Somalia, a cross-regional member states group within the UN system that was chaired at that time by Karen Pierce who was UK Ambassador to UN Missions in Geneva."]}, {"page": "List of international organization leaders in 2015", "response": ["**Director-General - Guy Ryder, United Kingdom (2012\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "List of international organization leaders in 2014", "response": ["**Director-General - Guy Ryder, United Kingdom (2012\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "2016 G20 Hangzhou summit", "response": ["File:Guy Ryder, February 2014 (cropped).jpg|20x18px|International Labour Organization International Labour OrganizationGuy Ryder, director-general"]}, {"page": "List of international organization leaders in 2016", "response": ["**Director-General - Guy Ryder, United Kingdom (2012\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "2017 G20 Hamburg summit", "response": ["File:Guy Ryder (cropped).jpg|23px|International Labour Organization International Labour Organization (ILO)Guy Ryder, director"]}, {"page": "Muriel P\u00e9nicaud", "response": ["Nominated by France's government in September 2021, P\u00e9nicaud is one of five candidates to succeed Guy Ryder as Director-General of the International Labor Organization in elections scheduled to take place in March 2022, alongside Gilbert Houngbo, Kang Kyung-wha, Mthunzi Mdwaba and Greg Vines.Le\u00efla de Comarmond (5 October 2021), La difficile bataille de Muriel P\u00e9nicaud pour prendre la t\u00eate de l'Organisation internationale du travail Les Echos."]}, {"page": "2019 G20 Osaka summit", "response": ["File:Guy Ryder, February 2014 (cropped).jpg|23x15px International Labour OrganizationGuy Ryder, Director-General"]}]}}
