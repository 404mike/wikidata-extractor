He made over 200 appearances for the United reserve team, but Matt Busby did not give him his First Division debut. Smith left Old Trafford in March 1965 to join Scunthorpe United. Under Fred Goodwin, the \"Iron\" finished the 1964\u201365 campaign in 18th place in the Third Division. They rose to fourth in 1965\u201366, still 12 points short of a promotion place, before they dropped to 18th in 1966\u201367. He moved to Grimsby Town, for a fee of \u00a38,000, but failed to prevent Don McEvoy's \"Mariners\" from slipping into the Fourth Division in 1967\u201368. Smith remained in the Third Division, signing with Freddie Goodwin's Brighton & Hove Albion in June 1968. The \"Seagulls\" finished 12th in 1968\u201369, before rising to fifth in 1969\u201370, only five points shy of the promotion places. Brighton dropped down to 14th in 1970\u201371 under Pat Saward, and in June 1971 Smith signed with Ken Roberts's Chester, but moved to Hartlepool United \u2013 initially on loan \u2013 in October of that year. Both teams struggled at the foot of the Football League, with Len Ashurst's \"Pools\" finishing just above the re-election places in 1971\u201372 and 1972\u201373. In August 1973 he moved to Bury as player-coach, but failed to appear in their league side."]}, {"page": "Frederick Goodwin", "response": ["*Fred Goodwin (born 1958), Scottish banker", "*Fred Goodwin (footballer) (1888\u20131945), English footballer who played in the Football League for Burnley", "*Fred Goodwins (1891\u20131923), silent film actor and director"]}, {"page": "British football clubs tours to South America", "response": ["|FW || || Fred Goodwin"]}]}}
