The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. \nDe Baissac was one of the first SOE female agents to be parachuted into occupied France in 1942.  During her two missions to France she often worked with her brother Claude who headed the Scientist network of SOE. The couple was most useful shortly before and after the D-Day invasion of France by the allies. The de Baissacs armed and organized French Resistance forces to hinder the German response to the invasion and to assist the allies. Lise de Baissac had frequent encounters with German soldiers in the heavily militarized region in which she worked, but she eluded capture.

Scientist was one of SOE's most promising networks, organizing and arming resistance groups and carrying out intelligence operations in a large area of southwestern France.  As a courier Herbert traveled widely by bicycle and train, liaising with the different groups of the French Resistance, carrying messages, documents, money, and wireless parts, acting as a post-office box for the members of the network, and seeking out safe houses and potential recruits. On one occasion when she was struggling to carry a heavy wireless set in a suitcase, a chivalrous German officer carried it for her onto a train. During her travels, Herbert became friends with de Baissac's sister Lise who was an SOE agent in Poitiers.

She told Landes who ordered her to cease all clandestine activities and installed her in a nursing home in the suburbs of Bordeaux where she had a daughter she named Claudine in early December 1943. With her daughter she left the nursing home and moved into an apartment in Poitiers that Lise de Baissac had rented.", "On 18 February 1944, Herbert was arrested in her apartment in Poitiers.  The German Gestapo had found out that Lise de Baissac was an SOE agent and that the apartment had been rented to her. The Germans initially thought that Herbert was de Baissac. The Germans imprisoned Herbert, leaving the baby with her maid. French Social Services put the child in a orphanage. Under interrogation, Herbert kept to her cover story and denied that she knew de Baissac. Her accented French, she said, was because she had lived in Egypt and spoke Arabic. She protested her innocence saying she knew nothing of the woman who had rented the apartment before her, that she had only been there a few weeks, and it was hardly likely that an SOE agent would have just given birth to a baby.", "Herbert and her daughter, Claudine, moved to a country house near Poitiers.
