He was a tall centre-forward who is probably best remembered from his six-year spell at Mansfield Town.\nRoberts, the son of former Coventry City striker Ted Roberts, began his career at his father's old club, signing a professional contract in November 1963. However, despite a good goalscoring record, he only played a handful of games for the Sky Blues, and moved to Mansfield Town in March 1968, making his debut against Brighton & Hove Albion.Roberts' greatest moment of fame came on 26 February 1969, when Roberts scored the first goal in Mansfield's shock 3\u20130 win against West Ham United in the fifth round of the FA Cup. The following year, he had a goal disallowed when Mansfield lost 2\u20130 against Leeds United, also in the fifth round of the FA Cup. He also had a goal disallowed in the goalless draw against Liverpool the same year in the League Cup, denying Mansfield a famous victory.In league competition, Roberts was Mansfield's top scorer in 1969\u201370 and 1970\u201371. He scored four goals in Mansfield's 6\u20132 win against Tranmere Rovers on 27 February 1971, and also scored a hat-trick on two other occasions.\nRoberts left Mansfield in the February 1974, having scored 73 goals in 230 games for the club.
