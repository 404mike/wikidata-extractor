Cricket, football, golf and tennis were all well within his grasp. However, in 1949 he chose tennis to the dismay of the players of the other sports.\nIn 1952, Becker played in the Davis Cup at 18 years of age, the youngest British player to have done so at the time, his record stood until 2005 when it was broken by Andy Murray aged 17. He served as Paul Hutchins' coach for a time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lew Hoad", "response": ["While he was in service, Hoad devised a weight-lifting exercise, doing push-ups with round 50 lb. weights placed on his back, which Hoad later believed probably initiated his back trouble. Hoad left the National Service at the end of April and his third overseas tour with an Australian team started on 5 May. For the first time in his career, Hoad was the top-seeded player at a Grand Slam tournament at the French Championships but he lost in the fourth round to 40-year-old Gardnar Mulloy. Hoad lost the doubles final with Rosewall to Seixas and Trabert in 56 minutes. Partnering Maureen Connolly, who had won the women's singles title, Hoad won the mixed-doubles final against Jacqueline Patorni and Rex Hartwig. In June, Hoad overcame countryman Rose in the final of the Queen's Club Championship to successfully defend his title. Hoad was seeded second behind Trabert at Wimbledon Championships. In the fourth round, Hoad avenged his loss to Mulloy at the French Championships, defeating him in four sets. In the quarterfinal the powerful service and excellent returns of Drobn\u00fd proved too much for Hoad and he was beaten in straight sets within an hour. Hoad and Rosewall were unable to defend their Wimbledon doubles title after losing in fives sets in the semifinal to Seixas and Trabert. A surprise loss against Roger Becker in the semifinal at the Midlands Counties Championships in Birmingham was followed in mid-July by winning the singles title at the Swiss Championships in Gstaad. As in the previous year, Hoad met Rosewall in the Eastern Grass Court Championships in August, this time in the final, and again the titleholder was victorious, overpowering Rosewall to win the singles title in three straight sets. At Newport in mid August, Hoad was beaten by 17-year-old compatriot Roy Emerson who won the deciding set 8\u20136. For the third time in 1954, Seixas and Trabert defeated Hoad and Rosewall at a Grand Slam doubles event, winning the U.S. Doubles Championships in Brookline."]}, {"page": "Pacific Coast Championships", "response": ["|1955|| Tony Trabert Vic Seixas || Enrique Morea Roger Becker ||6\u20133, 6\u20134 "]}, {"page": "Becker", "response": ["*Roger Becker (born 1934), British tennis player"]}, {"page": "1934 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 6 February \u2013 Roger Becker, tennis player (died 2017)"]}, {"page": "1955 Australian Championships \u2013 Men's Singles", "response": ["#  Roger Becker (Third round)"]}, {"page": "1954 U.S. National Championships \u2013 Men's Singles", "response": ["#  Roger Becker (Third round)"]}, {"page": "1956 French Championships \u2013 Men's Singles", "response": ["#  Roger Becker (Fourth round)"]}, {"page": "Bristol Open", "response": ["|1957 ||  Lew Hoad  ||  Roger Becker || 6\u20132, 6\u20133, 6\u20130"]}, {"page": "Manchester Open", "response": ["| 1955 ||  Hugh Stewart ||  Roger Becker ||  6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20131"]}, {"page": "John Barrett (tennis)", "response": ["His doubles successes included the capture of the 1953 National Covered Court title with Don Black of Rhodesia and the 1956 Asian Doubles with Roger Becker.
