In England, in the anarcho-punk scene, Andy Martin of The Apostles was equally forthright. Politically motivated U.S. bands such as MDC and 7 Seconds also introduced anti-homophobia messages into their songs at this time, while the Nip Drivers included a song titled \"Quentin\", dedicated to Quentin Crisp, in their repertoire."]}, {"page": "List of anarchist musicians", "response": ["* Andy Martin"]}, {"page": "The Apostles (band)", "response": ["Andy Martin joined as vocalist in summer 1981, and the group played their first concert on 22 September 1981. This line-up of the group then recorded an eponymous demo tape later that year.", "Andy Martin and Dave Fanning were joined in 1984 by Malcolm \"Scruff\" Lewty (later of Hellbastard, Sidewinder, Nero Circus and Heavy Water) and drummer Chris \"Widni\" Wiltshire which created a line-up which remained relatively stable (with the addition of Sean Stokes and Colin Murrell) until the group's demise at the end of the 1980s. The group recorded over 10 demo cassettes, 4 7\" singles and 7 12\" LP's between mid-1984 and 1990. Original guitarist Pete Bynghall re-joined the group in late 1988 for their last recordings and final concert (cf Live at the Academy).", "The anti-communist and anti-gay lyrics of 'Rock Against Communism' and 'Kill or Cure' on the 'Giving of Loving Costs Nothing' EP and other similarly themed later songs opened the group to charges of fascism and homophobia. Whilst this material was intended to expose the supine attitudes of those within the 'anarcho punk' milieu who did not challenge such blatantly provocative sentiments (a tactic which Andy Martin had used since his entrance to the group), they undermined the coherence of the band's ideology, leading Stewart Home, in his book Cranked Up Really High, to describe The Apostles as \"locked into...a stasis if not actual paralysis\".", "During the time the band was together Andy Martin began to write about his homosexuality and the subject in general which alienated many of their former fans but did not deter Martin. In 1989, Martin and Fannig gave an interview with Homocore fanzine which addressed this issue. Among their many recordings released, The Apostles contributed the song \"Forbidden Love\" to the first queercore compilation, JD.s Top Ten Homocore Hits, released by J.D.s  fanzine in 1990."]}, {"page": "Wapping Autonomy Centre", "response": ["The warehouse had been suggested by Andy Martin from the anarchist Little A printers who worked in the building.

Eloff stated that the sudden growth of animal liberation theory and practice within anarchism since the 1980s, which also developed into philosophies such as veganarchism, was most probably caused by the anarcho-punk subculture. According to author John King, the animal stance of anarcho-punk spread through all areas of punk, especially the traveller, hardcore, straight edge, and folk-punk scenes. Despite this, writer and musician Andy Martin of the influential band the Apostles was not as enthusiastic, stating in 2014 that \"Dave Morris and Helen Steel, for example, have achieved more for the campaign against McDonald's than every punk band there has ever been. This is not to unduly berate punk bands, but they must be regarded in the correct perspective...\""]}]}}
