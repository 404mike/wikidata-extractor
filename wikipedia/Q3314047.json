It so happened that Professor J. R. R. Tolkien, author of Allen & Unwin's children's book The Hobbit, had recently offered the firm a mock-mediaeval comic novella called Farmer Giles of Ham. Allen & Unwin had commissioned illustrations for the story from Milein Cosman, but Tolkien had disliked them. On 5 August 1948, he complained to Ronald Eames, Allen & Unwin's art director, that they were \"wholly out of keeping with the style or manner of the text\".Scull, Christina and Hammond, Wayne G.: The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide, 2nd edition; Harper Collins, 2017; Vol. 1, pp. 354 -361 Five days later, Eames wrote to Baynes requesting specimen drawings for \"an adult fairy story (complete with dragon and giant!)\" that would require \"some historical and topographical (Oxford and Wales) realism\".Scull, Christina and Hammond, Wayne G.: The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide, 2nd edition; Harper Collins, 2017; Vol. 2, pp. 112 - 113 She reassured Eames that she knew Oxford from having sketched there, and knew Wales from having picked Welsh potatoes. Visiting Allen & Unwin's offices at around the beginning of October to see what Baynes had produced for him, Tolkien was won over to her cause when Eames showed him her portfolio of Luttrell whimsies. The witty jeux d'esprit that she went on to create for his story delighted him.Tolkien. J. R. R.: Farmer Giles of Ham; Allen & Unwin, 1949 \"They are more than illustrations\", he wrote to Allen & Unwin on 16 March 1949, \"they are a collateral theme.

In 1968, Tolkien was sent a number of a suite of illustrations of The Lord of the Rings, mostly in coloured ink, by the English artist Mary Fairburn; Tolkien said of her pictures: \"They ... show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me.... I am beginning to ... think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing.\" For various reasons the project went no further, and Fairburn's illustrations were unknown until 2012.Tankard, Paul, \"An Unknown Vision of Middle-earth: Mary Fairburn: Tolkien Illustrator\", Times Literary Supplement, 14 September 2012. http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1124297.ece Crown Princess Margrethe (now Queen Margrethe II) of Denmark, an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter, was inspired to create illustrations to The Lord of the Rings in the early 1970s.
