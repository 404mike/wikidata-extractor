The iron prospector Henry Schneider arrived in Furness in 1839 and, with other investors, opened the Furness Railway in 1846 to transport iron ore and slate from local mines to the coast. Further hematite deposits were discovered, of sufficient size to develop factories for smelting and exporting steel. For a period of the late 19th century, the Barrow Hematite Steel Company-owned steelworks was the world's largest.Barrow Steelworks ", "In 1839 Henry Schneider arrived as a young speculator and dealer in iron, and he discovered large deposits of haematite in 1850. He and other investors founded the Furness Railway, the first section of which opened in 1846, to transport the ore from the slate quarries at Kirkby-in-Furness and haematite mines at Lindal-in-Furness and Askam and Ireleth to a deep-water harbour near Roa Island. The crucial and difficult link across Morecambe Bay between Ulverston and Carnforth on the main line was promoted, as the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway, by a group led by John Brogden and opened in 1857. It was promptly purchased by the Furness Railway."]}, {"page": "Furness Railway", "response": ["The subscription to the company was largely taken up by the Duke and the Earl, and their associates; although there were some local subscribers - Henry Schneider was on the company's provisional committee - failure to attract local capital meant that the original intention to serve Ulverston was dropped. The company's Bill was not opposed in Parliament and the Act was given Royal Assent on 23 May 1844. A further Act in 1846 authorised extensions from Kirkby to Broughton-in-Furness, and from Dalton to Ulverston. Goods traffic began running between Dalton and Barrow in June 1846, operated by a single locomotive.  The line was passed for passenger use early in August 1846; by the end of the month passenger trains were running from Dalton to Piel pier, connecting with a steamer to Fleetwood. At a celebratory excursion and dinner for the directors and friends held at the end of October 1846, it was remarked that the mineral traffic was limited by a shortage of wagons (which prevented the Dalton branch handling more than 2,000 tons of iron ore a day) and of locomotives (which meant that the Kirkby branch was not yet being worked), and that ten thousand of the twelve thousand passengers carried so far were excursionists from Fleetwood or Blackpool.  Passenger services ceased after about two months, and the line between Dalton and Rampside Junction was doubled to remove the difficulties experienced in working both mineral and passenger traffic on a single track line. In 1847 differences between the railway company and the owner of Piel pier saw the Fleetwood steamer running to Barrow; it returned to Piel pier in 1848 ; subsequently steamers also ran between Piel pier and Poulton-le-Sands, connecting with the \"Little\" North Western Railway. Periodic disagreements and reconciliations saw the steamer service terminal switch between Piel and Barrow on a number of occasions until (1853) the Furness Railway bought the pier."]}, {"page": "Transcription Broadcast Systems", "response": ["Transcription Broadcast Systems, also known as Green Schneider RKO, was founded in New York City, New York in 1939 by Raymond Green and Henry Schneider.

By 1896, 547 men were employed in the pits by the village and in nearby Roanhead, 347 of them underground. Several hundred others worked in local mines at Mouzell (between Ireleth and Dalton-in-Furness), Roanhead and Dalton. Some were owned by the Kennedy Brothers Ltd. firm of Ulverston Barrow Haematite Steel Co and the Millom and Askam Iron Company. The latter built four blast furnaces in the village to smelt the iron ore being brought from mines all over the peninsula by rail. The village continued to grow with terraced houses and allotments erected for the flood of immigrant labour needed to work the mines. They came from all parts of the British Isles, with a large proportion coming from existing mining areas in Cornwall and Ireland. The Cornish in particular tended to bring their families and settle, while the Irish often moved on to wherever there was work. Others came from areas where Askam's mine owners had other concerns, such as Scotland and Wales."]}, {"page": "Sharpe, Paley and Austin", "response": ["The rapid growth of the town of Barrow-in-Furness, the construction of the Furness Railway following the discovery of deposits of iron ore in the Furness peninsular, and the development of industries using iron as a raw material resulted in many commissions for the practice.  The population of Barrow doubled between 1851 and 1861, and doubled again in the next decade.  The major figure in the development of the town and the railway was James Ramsden (1822\u201396), who eventually became managing director of the railway, the Barrow Haematite Steel Company, and the Barrow Shipbuilding Company.  The largest deposits of iron ore had been discovered in about 1850 by Henry Schneider in land owned by William Cavendish, who was at that time the 2nd\u00a0Earl of Burlington, and who also played a part in the industry.  All three men commissioned the practice to design a variety of buildings.  In addition Paley designed a country house, Abbot's Wood (1857\u201359) for Ramsden, a large and complex building with Gothic and Tudor features.", "Meanwhile, the town of Barrow was continuing to grow, and this resulted in many commissions for the practice.  In order to deal with this they opened a sub-office in the town, run by John Harrison (1837\u201396), which continued to exist until the late 1880s.  The first major commission in the town was to design a flax and jute mill for James Ramsden (1870\u201372).  Other secular buildings included banks, cemetery buildings (including a large gateway), ten large tenement blocks, schools, villas, meeting halls, and the School of Art.  For the Furness Railway they designed stations, goods sheds, workers' cottages and, probably, the circular water tower at Seascale.  The partners were also involved with work at large country houses.  The most important commission was to build a new wing at Holker Hall in 1871\u201375 to replace a wing severely damaged by fire; this was the largest project undertaken by the partners.  The next major country house commission was the restoration of Hoghton Tower (1876\u201378) for Sir\u00a0Henry de\u00a0Hoghton.  Other work on country houses included building Sedgwick House (1868\u201369), adding an extension to Leighton Hall (1870), making extensions to Walton Hall (1870), Underley Hall (1872), Capernwray Hall (1875\u201376), and Whittington Hall (1887).  New houses included Oak Lea for Henry Schneider (1874, since demolished), Witherslack Hall (1874), and Hampsfield House (1880\u201382).  Their last major work on a country house was the remodelling of Thurland Castle (1879\u201385) following severe damage by fire.  The practice continued to design new schools, and in the 1870s", "Sharpe's earliest commissions were promoted by his older cousin Revd\u00a0J.\u00a0W.\u00a0Whitaker, vicar of Blackburn.  Whittaker had connections with major figures in the Church of England and members of the aristocracy.  Sharpe's work came to the notice of the Bishop of Chester, Rt\u00a0Rev\u00a0John Bird Sumner, whose diocese at that time included Lancashire as well as Cheshire.  He was a member of the Church Building Commission, and it is likely that he played a part in Sharpe's involvement in designing Commissioners' Churches.  Family connections led to an association with the Greenall family, brewers in Warrington, which possibly led to the commission for the series of churches along the Weaver Navigation.  Sharpe had hoped to gain commissions from the Earl of Derby, but was successful only in his design for St\u00a0Mary, Knowsley.  The relationship the practice developed with the major entrepreneurs in Barrow-in-Furness, James Ramsden, and Henry Schneider, resulted in the many commissions for buildings in the town and for the Furness Railway."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1857 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|NorwichElection declared void 12 March 1860.

The increasing quantities of iron ore mined in Furness were then brought to Barrow to be transported by sea. The sheltered strait between Barrow and Walney Island was an ideal location for the shipyard. The first ship to be built, Jane Roper, was launched in 1852; the first steamship, a 3,000-ton liner named Duke of Devonshire, in 1873. Shipbuilding activity increased, and on 18 February 1871 the Barrow Shipbuilding Company was incorporated.
