She takes us now into the Old Bailey during an exciting trial for murder, now into chambers where the human reactions of the lawyers engaged in the case may be studied; and when the trial is over and there seems no more to be said, she swiftly ravels again the skein which the law has confidently unravelled and leaves herself with a denouement which is at once surprising and credible.\" The reviewer outlined the basics of the plot, commenting that Patricia Jessel's performance in the dock was \"cold-blooded\" and that she \"makes a clear-cut image of hatred releasing itself suddenly from inhibitions which have become intolerable\" and that Derek Blomfield was \"equally good\". The greatest praise was reserved for the climax:  \"Mrs Christie has by this time got the audience in her pocket. A timely intervention of a woman of the streets offering new evidence seems precisely what the trial needs and when it is resumed the evidence brings it triumphantly to a satisfying conclusion.
