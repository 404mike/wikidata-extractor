At the 1796 general election he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the City of London.Combe was present in the House of Commons when the then Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, was assassinated in the lobby on 11 May 1812. He chaired a makeshift court convened the same day composed of MPs who were, like himself, also magistrates in order to begin committal proceedings against the murderer, John Bellingham, take witness statements and order messengers to search Bellingham's lodgings. Bellingham was ultimately hanged.\nHe held the seat for 21 years, until he resigned from the House of Commons in 1817 by taking the Chiltern Hundreds.He died the following year, aged about 66.
