Dean Beckwith put Hereford ahead before JJ Melligan and Adam Boyd gave Orient the win. Orient then continued the season with multiple poor results and performances throughout September and October and their only wins were away matches against Walsall and Southend United in the Football League Trophy first round. However Orient were knocked out of the trophy in the following round in an away match at Brighton & Hove Albion. They were in 22nd position in the League One table. Orient booked a place in the second round of the FA Cup after beating Colchester United 1\u20130. Two Goals from Jason Demetriou and Danny Granville in a 1\u20132 away victory against Bradford City put Orient through to the third round of the FA Cup where they played Sheffield United at home. They lost 4\u20131 and, after a run of bad form in the league, Orient parted company with manager Martin Ling and assistant Dean Smith. Youth team manager Kevin Nugent was named caretaker manager overseeing three games. On 5 February 2009 Geraint Williams was announced as manager until the end of the season. He enjoyed a very positive start, winning seven of his first nine matches and moving Orient up to 15th. After Geraint Williams' positive influence on the team they secured their League One status on 13 April with a 1\u20130 win over Swindon Town at the County Ground and eventually finished the season in 14th place."]}, {"page": "Maidstone United F.C.", "response": ["*  Dean Beckwith"]}, {"page": "Beckwith", "response": ["* Dean Beckwith (born 1983), English footballer"]}, {"page": "John McCombe", "response": ["He began 2007\u201308 as third-choice centre back, but an injury to Dean Beckwith gave McCombe his chance.

McCombe made 27 league appearances as Hereford gained promotion from League Two, but was dropped for the run-in, in favour of Karl Broadhurst. This coincided with McCombe's mistake in a key fixture against Chester City when he conceded a penalty kick in the last minute for handball, which enabled Chester to draw the match 2\u20132.
