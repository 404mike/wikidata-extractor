You\u2019ve got to get that absolutely right. If you want to be lazy nowadays, you get your actors off Spotlight. What I did, and I would recommend this to anyone, is to go out there and find your actors. I must have spent... two, two or three months on casting.\" The decision to cast Northern actors to play Northern roles was deliberate: \"it had veracity but also had its logical implications.\"  Garnett drew on his past experience as an actor before he became a story editor on The Wednesday Play: \"how can you get a Southern Tory actor to play a Northerner who spends his life down the pits? Or a Southern actress to play a shop girl?\" Once cast, it was strongly suggested that actors research their roles. \"With actors like Bernard [Atha, who plays Councillor Conway], casting him as the councillor when he is, in fact, a real councillor in Leeds, seemed very logical to me. His job as councillor comes as second nature to him, so he wasn\u2019t particularly bogged down with his character\u2019s actions.\" Therefore, Atha was able to give a very natural, realistic performance.  Christine Hargreaves, who plays Pauline, spent some time living with her on-screen children to develop a bond that \"would appear second-nature\" on screen. \"Christine was brilliant; a lovely, very honest woman. She was great with the kids. She would go out into the community where we filmed, making herself known to the locals, and integrate as much as possible.\""]}, {"page": "In Two Minds", "response": ["*Christine Hargreaves as Mary Winter"]}, {"page": "BBC2 Playhouse", "response": ["| Maurice O'ConnellCoral AtkinsChristine HargreavesDerek MartinEric MasonRichard IresonAlan FordTrevor LairdLeslie GranthamJimmy Winston"]}, {"page": "Shabby Tiger (TV series)", "response": ["* Christine Hargreaves as  Olga Kepple (4 episodes)"]}]}}
