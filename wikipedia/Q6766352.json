Marty has coprolalic Tourette's syndrome and is a pyromaniac. He was a guest character in the first series of Shameless, became a main character in the second series, and left along with Veronica and Kev Ball (Dean Lennox Kelly) in the first episode of the fourth series. Marty was originally something of a burden to the other characters, setting things alight when he got angry, particularly whenever he found Carol with much younger men. At one point he burns Carol's house down when he finds her having sex in the shower with his best friend, as well as burning down the toilets of The Jockey when Veronica attempts to have him sent back to prison after he escaped to attend her wedding; incidents like this have landed him in prison several times. His Tourette's syndrome often creates uncomfortable situations for him, causing him to reveal otherwise secret information or offend those who are not used to him by insulting/swearing. However, later in the series Debbie Gallagher (Rebecca Ryan) teaches Marty to use other words such as buttermilk and spongecake instead of swearing, and his pyromania seems to calm down when he starts a relationship with Sue Garland (Gillian Kearney). The two live relatively happily in the Gallagher household for a time, until Marty accompanies Kev and Veronica in a scheme to buy a Romanian baby from an orphanage. Marty escapes back to the Chatsworth with the stolen orphan and suggests to Sue that they raise it as their own. Initially Sue is reluctant but later saves the baby from being sent back by the police. Sue reveals that she is pregnant with Marty's child and the two leave the estate.", "Jessie McQueen, better known as Jez was the landlady of The Jockey on the Chatsworth estate during the first four series.

She later discovered the truth and the two women became good friends, running The Jockey together. In series 4, she employed murderer Jamie Maguire (Aaron McCusker) as barman out of fear of retribution if she didn't. She became a surrogate mother and left Carol Fisher (Marjorie Yates) to run The Jockey whilst she was on maternity leave. After giving birth, she didn't return to The Jockey or Chatsworth, last being mentioned when The Jockey punters wanted to send her get-well cards after she had the baby. She has not been heard or seen since going on maternity leave, and she completely lost control of the Jockey when the brewery appointed Karen as landlady.
