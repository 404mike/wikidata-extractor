It grew out of the experience he gained repairing and restoring antique furniture and woodwork as he transformed the interiors of his own house in the 1830s and received added impetus from 1842 onwards from the commission to create the Trinity Chapel in Rochdale. In the late 1840s he sold fake Tudor and Jacobean furniture to Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby, and Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland. Most of the latter work survives at Warkworth Castle, Northumberland. Shaw also tried to persuade George Bridgeman, 2nd Earl of Bradford, to buy a fake \u2018State Bed\u2019 and other items, but it is not known whether he was successful. It is likely that Shaw ceased fabricating antiques about 1850 as his architectural career gathered momentum. His own bed, created from a mix of old and new parts, is on display in Ordsall Hall, Salford."]}]}}
