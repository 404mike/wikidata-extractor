Edwards is the recipient of the Corday-Morgan Medal (1985), the Tilden Lectureship (1993\u201394) and Liversidge Award (1999) of the Royal Society of Chemistry. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1996 and was awarded the 2003 Hughes Medal of the Royal Society  \"for his distinguished work as a solid state chemist. He has made seminal contributions to fields including superconductivity and the behaviour of metal nanoparticles, and has greatly advanced our understanding of the phenomenology of the metal-insulator transition\". In 2009 Edwards was elected to the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina,  and he was elected Einstein Professor for 2011 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2012 he was awarded the Bakerian Lecture by the Royal Society \"in recognition of decisive contributions to the physics, chemistry and materials science of condensed matter, including work on the metal-insulator transition\". In the spring of 2012 he was elected International Member of the American Philosophical Society; one of only four people from the UK in that year to be awarded this honour across all subjects and disciplines. Later in 2012 he was awarded the Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers Materials Science Venture Prize for his work on new, low-cost, high-performance conducting oxide coatings for solar cells and optoelectronic materials. In the Autumn of 2013 he was elected Member of Academia Europaea, and he was elected as a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Society Bakerian Medal", "response": ["*2012 Peter Edwards, Metals and the conducting and superconducting states of matter"]}, {"page": "Peter Edwards", "response": ["Peter Edwards may refer to:", "* Peter Edwards (vexillologist) (1931\u20132019), Canadian vexillologist", "* Peter Edwards (artist) (born 1955), British painter", "* Peter Edwards (rugby league) (born 1969), New Zealand former professional rugby league footballer", "* Peter Edwards (rugby union) (born 1980), English rugby union player", "* Peter Edwards (chemist) (born 1949), British scientist", "* Peter Edwards (historian) (born 1945), Australian diplomatic and military historian", "* Peter Edwards (rower) (born 1939), Australian Olympic rower", "* Peter Edwards (pianist), British pianist, composer and band leader"]}, {"page": "Anthony Barrett", "response": ["Barrett was the first to demonstrate the increased stability of per-alkylated aza crown ether analogues under dissolving metal reduction conditions.
