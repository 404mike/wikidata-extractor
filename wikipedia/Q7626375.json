It was co-sponsored by eighteen other Republican senators, including then-Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, and two Democratic Senators, Bob Kerry of Nebraska and David Boren of Oklahoma. It was read twice in the Senate, but was neither debated nor voted upon. Many of the ideas in the bill were originally proposed by Stuart Butler in 1989, when he worked at the Heritage Foundation,  however, some conservatives believed that it was too liberal.   It was introduced as an alternative to legislation unveiled earlier that year by then-President Bill Clinton. As a bipartisan bill, it was one of a few comprehensive health care reform bills not to be introduced along party lines (as of 2008)."]}, {"page": "Violet Bland", "response": ["In 1915, though now 52 and unmarried, Bland fostered five of her sister's orphaned children.

One editorial was written by Peter Orszag, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget earlier in the Obama administration, and a major architect of the ACA. Orszag argued that the ACA had generally succeeded in its objectives, in line with what Obama argued in his article, while the other three editorials (one by Stuart Butler, one by Jonathan Skinner and Amitabh Chandra, and one by Howard Bauchner) were more critical of Obama's conclusions. For example, the editorial by Skinner and Chandra criticized Obama's claim that the ACA was limiting the growth of health care spending, and Butler's editorial argued that the savings produced by the ACA may not have benefited consumers."]}, {"page": "Stuart M.
