Robert Dahl argued in On Democracy that capitalism was beneficial for democracy because economic growth and a large middle class were good for democracy.

Iversen and Soskice similarly see democracy and capitalism as mutually supportive. G\u00f8sta Esping-Andersen argues against convergence by pointing to presence of a variety of welfare state arrangements in capitalist states. Scholars such as Paul Pierson, Neil Fligstein and Robert Gilpin have argued that it is not globalization per se that has undermined the welfare state, but rather purposeful actions by conservative governments and interest groups that back them. Historical institutionalist scholarship by Pierson and Jacob Hacker has emphasized that once welfare states have been established, it is extremely difficult for governments to roll them back, although not impossible. Nita Rudra has found evidence of a race-to-the-bottom in developing countries, but not in developed countries; she argues that this is due to the elevated bargaining power of labor in developed countries."]}, {"page": "Ordoliberalism", "response": ["Because of the connected history, ordoliberalism is also sometimes referred to as \"German neoliberalism\".

Later on, while at the University of Cambridge, U.K., he came under the influence of the two senior post-Keynesian economists: Luigi Lodovico Pasinetti and Geoff Harcourt. He has written extensively with Roberto Scazzieri, of the Universities of Bologna and Cambridge and of the Lincei Academy. His contributions are mainly in the field of income and wealth distribution, both at the macro- and micro-level. In particular he has fruitfully incorporated into the post-Keynesian model of distribution and accumulation the well-known life-cycle theory of Ando-Brumberg&Modigliani, within an overlapping-generations model, and with a strong bequest motive.", "Mauro Baranzini was born in Bellinzona, Switzerland, 31 August 1944, son of Leo Johann Baranzini-Franki, a railways worker, and of Germana Nonella-Bassi of Sant\u2019Antonino.

In Fribourg he obtained a PhD. in economics with a thesis on economic growth under the supervision of Pietro Balestra, a well-known econometrician. Soon after, in 1971, he was awarded a Florey European fellowship of The Queen's College, Oxford, a grant scheme to bring promising European scholars to Oxford, and subsequently a senior research fellowship of the Swiss National Science Foundation for research to be undertaken, in turn, in Oxford, Cambridge, and Harvard.
