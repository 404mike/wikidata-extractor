There were a number of personnel changes this season, with Archie Grant and captain Ted Birnie moving to Chelsea and George Walker going to New Brompton. Palace's hat-trick hero in their FA Cup exploits of last season, Walter Watkins, also moved on to Northampton Town. In their places Palace brought in a number of new faces.  Charles Ryan joined from Nunhead, Thomas Wills from Newcastle, Bill Forster from Sheffield United and Bill Ledger from Pryhope Villa.  Wilf Innerd was made captain and played in all but one of the club's League and Cup matches. The club struggled to find their feet on the new division, and failed to score in 13 of their matches, finishing the season in 19th position, one place off the bottom.  This was enough to ensure safety though, as for this season there was no relegation. Palace again called on a number of amateurs from the local area and beyond, including Henry Littlewort. Littlewort, who made his only appearance for the club this season, would go on to win a gold medal with the British Football team in the 1912 Olympics.", "|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Henry Littlewort"]}, {"page": "List of 1912 Summer Olympics medal winners", "response": ["|style=\"width:12em\" valign=top|   Arthur BerryRonald BrebnerThomas BurnJoseph DinesEdward HanneyGordon HoareArthur KnightHenry LittlewortDouglas McWhirterIvan SharpeHarold StamperHarold WaldenVivian WoodwardGordon Wrightthumb|right|200px|The Great Britain squad"]}]}}
