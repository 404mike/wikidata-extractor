This left City at the top of the Third Division table and Brian Clark had scored 11 goals in 7 matches while Atyeo had scored two hat-tricks in only five games in a 5\u20131 win v Walsall on 29 August 1964 and a 4\u20130 win v Southend United on 8 September. After this Bristol City remained near the top but never again reached the top two promotion positions until the final two games of the season. The final run in of 12 wins in the last 15 matches clinching promotion on goal average on the final day with a 2\u20130 win v Oldham Athletic in front of a crowd of 28,248 on 24 April 1965. Atyeo scored six goals in the final three games including 4 goals in a 5\u20131 win at Shrewsbury Town on 19 April 1965. Brian Clark ended the season as ever present and top scorer with 24 goals. Atyeo scored 23 goals but made fewer appearances playing in only 38 matches. Atyeo began the season at centre forward flanked by inside forwards Clark and \"Shadow\" Williams. Williams was replaced for a spell in mid season by young Gerry Sharpe and then Williams was sold for \u00a311,000 to Rotherham United. This led to a switch with Atyeo reverting to inside right, Clark moving to inside left and utility player Terry Bush stepping up from half back to centre forward to good effect scoring eight times in the run in to promotion. Atyeo was captain of this promotion winning team."]}, {"page": "Gordon Parr", "response": ["Bobby Etheridge began the following season in the right half position but Parr replaced him with Bristol City lying 14th in the table. Parr remained at right half for the rest of season 1963\u201364 making 39 appearances scoring two goals as City climbed the table to finish 5th. Parr also played in all of the 5 FA Cup ties as City lost 1\u20135 at Sunderland in the 4th round. Parr started as right half in the following season and made 21 appearances scoring one goal before first Terry Bush and then Chuck Drury completed the season in the right half position as Bristol City finished runners up in the Third Division."]}, {"page": "GRT Records", "response": ["Artists who released material on GRT Records in the United States included The Mojo Men, Sam Taylor, Lighthouse, Bobby Jameson, Edwards Hand, Terry Bush, Ronnie Hawkins, Colosseum, Mainline, Minnie Riperton, Flower Travellin' Band, Rastus, String Driven Thing, Lotti Golden, Van der Graaf Generator, Meri Wilson and Steve Hackett.
