He is best remembered for several horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical Show Boat.\nWhale was born into a large family in Dudley, Worcestershire now Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. He discovered his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realised he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play Journey's End led to his move to the US, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime romantic partner, producer David Lewis. Apart from Journey's End (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and Hell's Angels (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterised by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera.\nAt the height of his career as a director, Whale directed The Road Back (1937), a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision, and it was a critical failure. A run of box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was effectively over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.\nWhale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very rare in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more widespread, some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clive Barker", "response": ["He served as an executive producer for the 1998 film Gods and Monsters, a semi-fictional tale of Frankenstein director James Whale's later years, which won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Karloff reprised the role of Frankenstein's monster in Bride of Frankenstein (1935) for James Whale. Then he and Lugosi were reunited for The Raven (1935).

While the Winnipeg Free Press thought that the electrical equipment might have been better suited to Buck Rogers, nonetheless the reviewer praised the film as \"exciting and sometimes morbidly gruesome\", declaring that \"All who enjoyed Frankenstein will welcome his Bride as a worthy successor.\" The New York Times called Karloff \"so splendid in the role that all one can say is 'he is the Monster.

That's a critical interpretation that has nothing to do with the original inspiration.\" He concludes, \"I think the closest you can come to a homosexual metaphor in his films is to identify that certain sort of camp humor.\" Whale's companion David Lewis stated flatly that Whale's sexual orientation was \"not germane\" to his filmmaking, saying, \"Jimmy was first and foremost an artist, and his films represent the work of an artist\u00a0\u2013 not a gay artist, but an artist.\"", "* Gods and Monsters, a 1998 James Whale biopic that draws its title from a quote from Bride of Frankenstein", "* Curtis, James (1998).

Turner always detested the nickname, and upon seeing a sneak preview of the film, she recalled being profoundly embarrassed and \"squirming lower and lower\" into her seat. She stated that she had \"never seen myself walking before\u2026 [It was] the first time [I was] conscious of my body.\" Several years after the film's release, Modern Screen journalist Nancy Squire wrote that Turner \"made a sweater look like something Cleopatra was saving for the next visiting Caesar\". Shortly after completing They Won't Forget, she made an appearance in James Whale's historical comedy The Great Garrick (1937), a biographical film about British actor David Garrick, in which she had a small role portraying an actress posing as a chambermaid."]}, {"page": "Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama", "response": ["| Ian McKellen || James Whale || Gods and Monsters "]}, {"page": "Douglas Fairbanks Jr.", "response": ["Fairbanks Jr. began to work increasingly in action/adventure films: The Sun Never Sets (1939) at Universal; Rulers of the Sea (1939) at Paramount; Green Hell (1940) for James Whale at Universal, a flop; and Safari (1940) at Paramount."]}, {"page": "Dudley", "response": ["thumb|175px|Sculpture for James Whale, outside Dudley Showcase Cinema.", "*James Whale (1889 in Dudley \u2013 1957), Horror film director, IMDb Database retrieved December 2017 known for his films Frankenstein, The Old Dark House, The Invisible Man and Bride of Frankenstein"]}, {"page": "Christopher Bram", "response": ["His 1995 novel Father of Frankenstein, about film director James Whale, was made into the 1998 movie Gods and Monsters starring Ian McKellen, Lynn Redgrave, and Brendan Fraser.

Edward is found living alone in the attic of a Gothic castle, a setting that is also used for main characters in Burton's Batman and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Edward Scissorhands climaxes much like James Whale's Frankenstein and Burton's own Frankenweenie. A mob confronts the \"evil creature\", in this case, Edward, at his castle. With Edward unable to consummate his love for Kim because of his appearance, the film can also be seen as being influenced by Beauty and the Beast. Edward Scissorhands is a fairy tale book-ended by a prologue and an epilogue featuring Kim Boggs as an old woman telling her granddaughter the story, augmenting the German Expressionism and Gothic fiction archetypes."]}, {"page": "Brendan Fraser", "response": ["He also played a dramatic role in 1998's Gods and Monsters, which was based on the life of James Whale (Ian McKellen), who directed Frankenstein.

He lent his voice for the unreleased animated film Big Bug Man, with Marlon Brando. In 2002, he starred alongside Michael Caine in the political drama The Quiet American which was well received by critics.
