He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Canterbury at a by-election in November 1927, holding the seat until he retired in 1945 because of a wish expressed by party leaders that no candidate should be aged over 70.\nIn 1931, the Conservative whip was withdrawn from him when he supported Sir Ernest Petter, standing as an Independent Conservative against the official Conservative candidate, in the Westminster St George's by-election, but it was restored before the general election later that year.\nWayland served as chairman of the Empire Day Movement from 1927 to 1948.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wayland", "response": ["* William Wayland (1869\u20131950), English Conservative Party politician"]}, {"page": "Canterbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir William Wayland"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir William Wayland"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir William Wayland"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|William Wayland"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir William Wayland"]}, {"page": "William Abraham Wayland", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Wayland"]}, {"page": "1927 Canterbury by-election", "response": ["*On 7 November 1927 The Canterbury Unionist Association chose 58-year-old Sir William Wayland as their candidate to defend the seat.
