Club gave the film a grade of \"F\" and wrote: \"It probably isn't possible for a single movie to reverse all social progress made since the civil-rights era, but Norbit, the latest broadside from Eddie Murphy, does its best to turn back the clock\" and \"hideously offensive black stereotypes are merely the tip of the iceberg.\" Josh Tyler of Cinemablend.com gave the movie a mostly negative review, in which he described parts of the film as \"pretty despicable\" and stated that \"the plot relies on the idea that being fat also means you're a horrible bitch.\" However, he pointed out that \"some of it's also kind of sweet. Eddie's really quite good as Norbit, the character is sympathetic and funny. He has a strange sort of perfect chemistry with Thandie Newton, and that's just not something I would have expected.\""]}]}}
