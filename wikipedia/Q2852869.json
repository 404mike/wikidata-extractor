He works academically with a variety of labour-intensive art technics such as encaustic on canvas for his paintings, watercolor on paper for his drawings, or aquatint on copper plate for his etchings.  Writing about him in the Architectural Digest, Cristina Gim\u00e9nez says: \"At a time when almost no artists draw, he converts this discipline into the central tenet of his work: black lines on a white background: With ink on paper or encaustic on canvas (an ancient technique using wax as a pigment binder) his production is impeccable and the effects are spectacular.\" Based on images which are originally newspaper cut-outs or photographs, he uses the contemporary techniques of appropriation as an aim to navigate the space between reality and truth. His favorite saying is by the painter Torres Garc\u00eda, who said, \"Reality has three dimensions, whilst truth has only two.\" The majority of his works are in black and white, and he extends Torres Garc\u00eda's phrase in the sense that reality is multi-coloured, whilst we tend to represent the truth in black and white. For him it is a scale of greys. He does not see black and white as a bi-chromatic reality, but as intervention and non-intervention. He converts the white background of his works on wax into an ether, a void on which he intervenes or does not intervene, in such a way that the three-dimensional or multi-coloured reality becomes his work, not just in the two-dimensional reality, but in a one-dimensional reality consisting of intervention or non-intervention. His encaustic technique is in an alchemistic and time-consuming process.
