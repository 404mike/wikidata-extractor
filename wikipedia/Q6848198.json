A fortnight later against Hampshire he claimed a career-best 7-51, but he was never to achieve anything like that success again, taking more than one wicket in only two more games. He did, however, manage his modest best score with the bat (28) against Lancashire in July."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Glamorgan never had a settled team and there were a number of new arrivals at the end of the season including Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Eaglestone, Norman Hever and Phil Clift. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran Austin Matthews in his final season, Jim Pleass, Arthur Porter and Maurice Robinson.Playfair, pp. 97\u201398."]}, {"page": "William Bates (cricketer)", "response": ["He joining Briton Ferry Steel C.C. in 1914, as the War shut down first-class cricket for four years. He served as a sergeant in the Royal Engineers during the war. Bates qualified for Glamorgan over this time, and found a regular spot as a determined opening batsman and useful spinner as cricket resumed after the war. Though he scored a thousand runs in 1923; without reaching a century in 1927, he became the first Glamorgan batsman to record a ton in each innings, with 105 and 111 against Essex. He reached his peak as a batsman in this year, recording a double hundred against Worcestershire at Kidderminster, and another ton against Nottinghamshire to finish the summer with 1,645 runs to his account. He also passed the 1,500 runs mark in 1928, and began a most prolific partnership with a fellow Tyke, Arnold Dyson. The pair took delight in sharing a stand of 233 for the first wicket against Yorkshire, at Sheffield, in 1930.
