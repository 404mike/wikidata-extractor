She served as Chief Secretary for Administration from 2012 to 2017 and Secretary for Development from 2007 to 2012.\nAfter graduating from the University of Hong Kong, Lam joined the British Hong Kong civil service in 1980 and served in various government agencies. She became a key official in 2007 when she was appointed Secretary for Development. During her tenure, she earned the nickname \"tough fighter\" for her role in the controversial demolition of the Queen's Pier in 2008.\nLam became Chief Secretary for Administration under the Leung Chun-ying administration in 2012. From 2013 to 2015 Lam headed the Task Force on Constitutional Development for the 2014 Hong Kong electoral reform and held talks with student and opposition leaders during the widespread protests. In the 2017 Chief Executive selection process, Lam obtained 777 votes from the 1,194-member appointed Election Committee as the Beijing-favoured candidate and became the first female Chief Executive of Hong Kong.\nLam's administration has seen controversies, including the trial and imprisonment of democracy activists, the disqualification of several pro-democracy candidates, as well as the criminalisation of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party. Her government was also criticised for raising the qualification age for Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and for its handling of the cross-harbour tunnel toll plan, among other policies.\nIn mid-2019, Lam's government pushed for a controversial amendment to the extradition law which received widespread domestic and international opposition. Massive protests broke out and persisted throughout the latter half of the year, from demanding the withdrawal of the bill to Lam's resignation among five key demands. Lam suspended the bill in June and did not withdraw the bill until September. She also stood firmly against the other demands including an independent inquiry into police conduct and universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections. The clashes between the protesters and police escalated, which resulted in more than 9,000 arrests as of July 2020. Lam's popularity also dropped to a historic low with the pro-Beijing camp suffering the worst landslide defeat in history in the November District Council election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Politics of Hong Kong", "response": ["On 15 June 2019, Chief Executive Carrie Lam decided to indefinitely suspend the bill in light of the protest, but also made it clear in her remarks that the bill was not withdrawn.

In January 2020, Carrie Lam stated that \"My view is this: as long as we persist with the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, push forward the implementation of 'One Country, Two Systems' and have a full understanding and implementation of the principle... then we have adequate reason to believe that 'One Country, Two Systems' will be implemented smoothly and in the long term, and it will not change after 2047.\"", "Additionally, in a June 2020 online webinar to campaign for the National Security Law, Zhang Xiaoming said that the National Security Law would ensure that the freedoms granted to the city can be extended beyond 2047. However, neither Carrie Lam or Zhang Xiaoming have promised such an extension or laid out concrete steps or goals in order for it to happen.", "In October 2021, Carrie Lam reiterated that she believed the system would be extended beyond 2047, stating \"Anybody would seriously ask: why do we have to change it? But of course, something more concrete will have to come out later on to give the needed assurance about the continuation of the common law system, the monetary system, the professional recognition system, maybe some land leases.\"", "It was officially announced in September 2012 that the Hong Kong government would introduce compulsory \u201cnational, moral and civic education\u201d in all non-international primary and secondary schools to strengthen \u201cnational identity awareness and nurture patriotism towards China\u201d. According to an academic research paper, the current school curriculum in Hong Kong projects a \u201cdual sense of identity: \u2018Chineseness\u2019 and \u2018Hongkongesness\u2019\u201d  and notably, this has created strong public activism by Hong Kong pre and post 1997. However, the new curriculum includes \u2018general civic education\u2019 and lessons meant to increase students' appreciation of China. This announcement led to 10 days of protests, with up to 120,000 protesters each day, due to concerns of Hong Kong losing autonomy. In response, Chief executive at the time, CY Leung, chose to remove the idea of compulsory teaching, meaning that schools could freely decide if they would teach the subject. Despite CY Leung's decision, new chief executive Carrie Lam, who took over on 1 July 2017, has prioritised the topic of national education, by placing importance on \u201cinstilling patriotism in pupils\u201d. Furthermore, in August 2017, Christine Choi Yuk-Lin was appointed by the Government as the under-secretary of the Education Bureau. She \u201chas former connections with the pro-Beijing Federation of Education Workers\u201d (SCMP article A). This led to more than 17,000 people signing a petition opposing Yuk-lin having the position. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping also announced during his visit to Hong Kong in July 2017 the need for an enhancement and boost of \u201cnational history and culture\u201d in Hong Kong education.", "In April 2019, an extradition bill was proposed in Hong Kong inciting mass protests. The new law identifies that those who are suspects of serious crimes could be sent to China. This was initiated due to a murder suspect fleeing from Taiwan to Hong Kong in 2018. He was accused of murdering his pregnant 20 year old girlfriend, thus Hong Kong authorities were asked by Taiwan to extradite the man. Hong Kong, however, did not concur with this demand and could not prosecute him as Hong Kong does not have any form of an extradition agreement with Taiwan. In terms of the Extradition Law, it was claimed that decisions would be made on a \u2018case-by-case basis by the Chief Executive\u2019, in addition to Hong Kong courts making final decisions on extradition requests. For this reason, those accused of crimes based on politics or religion would not be extradited, and the new law would purely be \u201cdealing with cross border crimes and transnational crimes\u201d that carries a minimum 7 years sentence, as Carrie Lam stated in her speech on Monday 10 June. However, many Hong Kong people claim that this is another example of Hong Kong losing its autonomy. There has been criticism that this law would mean that suspects would be susceptible to many practices under the Chinese judicial system that is not present in the Hong Kong judicial system: arbitrary detention, unfair trial and torture. Michael DeGolyer, a researcher at Baptist University of Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera that Hong Kong people fear lack of judicial independence as the current judiciary system \u201cis seen as guaranteeing a measure of protection from the government on the mainland\u201d.", "Due to this negative response nationally and internationally, on 4 September 2019, Carrie Lam formally announced that the extradition bill would be withdrawn. Despite this, fear of the loss of Hong Kong autonomy remains. Protests continued until the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020, and are predicted to continue once the pandemic is under control in Hong Kong."]}, {"page": "Tung Chee-hwa", "response": ["In 2014, Tung founded a thinktank Our Hong Kong Foundation.

In February, Hong Kong Economic Journal cited unnamed sources that Tung Chee-hwa said in a close-door meeting that Beijing may not appoint former Financial Secretary of Hong Kong John Tsang as Chief Executive even if he wins the election. He said this was the reason he asked Carrie Lam to run in the election in order to prevent an \"embarrassing situation\". 30 electors of the Legal subsector in the Election Committee expressed \"deep concerns\" about Tung's comments in a joint statement, stating that \"such action undermines the fairness of our Chief Executive election and shows a callous disregard for the aspirations of most Hong Kong people to have free and fair elections without ignorant and insensitive interference.\" He was dubbed as \"kingmaker\" in the Hong Kong political community."]}, {"page": "Iron Lady (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Carrie Lam (born 1957), Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration (2012\u20132017) and Chief Executive since 2017"]}, {"page": "Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation", "response": ["|Carrie Lam"]}, {"page": "Government of Hong Kong", "response": ["The Chief Executive is the head of Region and head of government of Hong Kong.
