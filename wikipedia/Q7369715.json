He studied Fine Art at the University of Ulster and at the Chelsea College of Art and Design and has been a visiting speaker at Harvard University and the University of Oxford. He currently resides and works in Northern Ireland.In 1997 his first public sculpture commission in bronze (The Ulster Brewer) was placed at the Waterfront Hall, Belfast. He was commissioned for the centenary C. S. Lewis Sculpture in 1998, placed in east Belfast. His many portrait commissions have included Nobel Laureates Derek Walcott and Seamus Heaney, and the playwright Arthur Miller. His work is displayed across the world among several public and private collections.In 2001 Wilson was invited by HRH the Prince of Wales to join him for a dinner party at Hillsborough Castle. This catalysed the unique bond and friendship with Prince Charles, which flourished from then on in. Ross swapped paintings he had done of the Donegal based artist Derek Hill, who had been the Princes mentor and teacher in art throughout his life, this clearly struck a chord with the Prince as Ross was continually asked to spend weekends with him and others at Balmoral castle, the residence of the royal family \nSays Ross: \u201cI was asked to bring my paints with me and I did some landscapes and snow-scapes over there. The Prince, who\u2019s a very accomplished artist himself, liked some of my work, and to my surprise he offered to swap one of his paintings for one of mine. Which, of course, I agreed to do.\u201d\nHe\u2019s one of the most genuine people I\u2019ve ever met and I think he\u2019s misunderstood because the Press misrepresent him,\u201d adds Ross, who met the Prince on a public stage last year during a Royal visit to the East Belfast Network Centre, which had transformed from an old school in Templemore Avenue with a grant from Charles\u2019 Regeneration Trust. Truly transformational and radical conversations were said to have been had on his visits to Balmoral, and the friendship between the two men still stands.\nRoss was then announced the High Sherriff of County Londonderry; the principal formal duties of High Sheriffs today are including the attendance and accompaniment at royal visits in the County and support for Her Majesty's High Court Judges when on Circuit.\nFamily\nRoss is married to Elizabeth Wilson who studied fashion and textiles in Belfast, and has one daughter, Grace (born 2001) who pursued studies at Durham University.\nWilson mentioned in an article to the Belfast times, that his daughter, Grace, spoke of becoming an artist through her childhood,  \"But I have tried to encourage her to concentrate on her talent as a musician,\" says Ross. \"An artist's life is a difficult path.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of artists from Northern Ireland", "response": ["*Ross Wilson (1958\u2013 )"]}, {"page": "Harvest Storm", "response": ["*Ross Wilson \u2013 Artwork"]}, {"page": "Island Angel", "response": ["*Ross Wilson \u2013 Cover Image"]}, {"page": "Horse with a Heart", "response": ["*Ross Wilson \u2013 Artwork"]}, {"page": "The Red Crow", "response": ["*Ross Wilson \u2013 Artwork"]}, {"page": "Ross Wilson", "response": ["Ross Wilson may refer to:", "* Ross Wilson (Nordic skier) (1909-1997), Canadian Olympic skier", "* Ross Wilson (ice hockey) (1919\u20132002), Canadian hockey player", "* Ross Wilson (sprinter) (born 1950), Australian sprinter in Athletics at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games", "* Ross Wilson (long-distance runner) (born 1969), New Zealander in 1988 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Junior men's race", "* Ross Wilson (table tennis) (born 1995), British paralympic table tennis player", "* Ross Wilson (musician) (born 1947), Australian musician, songwriter, and singer", "* Ross Wilson (ambassador) (born 1955), U.S. diplomat and ambassador", "* Ross Wilson (artist) (born 1958), Irish artist and sculptor"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["*Ross Wilson (disambiguation), several people", "**Ross Wilson (ice hockey) (1919\u20132002), Canadian ice hockey player", "**Ross Wilson (musician) (born 1947), Australian musician, songwriter, and singer", "**Ross Wilson (ambassador) (born 1955), U.S. diplomat and ambassador", "**Ross Wilson (artist) (born 1958), Irish artist and sculptor", "**Ross Wilson (table tennis) (born 1995), British paralympic table tennis player"]}, {"page": "List of Ulster University people", "response": ["*Ross Wilson, sculptor"]}, {"page": "Ella Pirrie", "response": ["Statue at the Belfast City Hospital, by Ross Wilson, 2007.
