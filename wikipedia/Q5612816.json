The Tornados' instrumental \"Telstar\" (1962), written and produced by Meek, became the first record by a British rock group to reach number one in the US Hot 100. It also spent five weeks at number one in the UK singles chart, with Meek receiving an Ivor Novello Award for this production as the \"Best-Selling A-Side\" of 1962. He also produced music for films such as Live It Up! (US title Sing and Swing, 1963), a pop music film.  Meek's concept album I Hear a New World (1960), which contains innovative use of electronic sounds, was not fully released in his lifetime.", "In January 1960, together with William Barrington-Coupe, Meek founded Triumph Records. At the time Barrington-Coupe was working at SAGA records in Empire Yard, Holloway Road for Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks and it was the Major who provided the finance. The label very nearly had a No.1 hit with Meek's production of \"Angela Jones\" by Michael Cox. Cox was one of the featured singers on Jack Good's TV music show Boy Meets Girl and the song was given massive promotion. As an independent label, Triumph was dependent on small pressing plants, which were unable to meet the demand for product. The record made a respectable appearance in the Top Ten, but it demonstrated that Meek needed the distribution network of the major companies for his records to reach retail outlets."]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["* Michael Cox: Singer and actor, best known for his 1960 Top Ten hit Angela Jones."]}, {"page": "John D.

Another concert followed in February with Johnny Kidd & the Pirates. In April, a national concert tour started with The Temperance Seven, Chas McDevitt and Shirley Douglas and Bert Weedon, and this led to a concert tour starting on 29 April with Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, The Viscounts, Vince Eager, Mark Eden, Danny Storm, Buddy Britten and Dave Reid. Before the final show at the Tower Ballroom, New Brighton, Laurie Jay announced his departure. A drummer was needed that night, and they recruited Ringo Starr, who had just returned from Hamburg after playing for Rory Storm and The Hurricanes. Jay went into management, later becoming the manager for Billy Ocean and Shirley Bassey. On returning to London, Tommy Frost became The Echoes' new drummer. After this tour Hines also left for Hamburg again, and was replaced by Ray Murray on keyboards. By May 1962, the Echoes line up became Dave Burns (guitar), Tommy Frost (drums), Ray Murray (keyboards), and Douggie Reece (bass). The Echoes performed a summer season in Douglas, Isle of Man in the \"Star Parade of 1962\", a rock and roll concert at The Crescent Pavilion. During the day they were required to play at The Palace Ballroom, playing relief for Ronnie Aldrich and The Squadronaires during the band's breaks. With the completion of the summer season, the Echoes returned to London and a meeting had been arranged with Mike Collier, who had just returned to England, after several years working in the music industry in America. He wanted to put together a team for his company, Micol Productions, and wanted the Echoes to be the rhythm section for his productions. Together with the arranger, Al Saxon, they began their association with Micol Productions. This led to the release on their first of four singles \"Sounds Like Winter\" in November 1961 on the Fontana. Other records for Micol Productions were released on Decca, Columbia and Fontana. The Echoes had already played at The Cavern Club in Liverpool, but on 3 September, they performed on the same bill as The Beatles. The year ended with a tour this time with B. Bumble and the Stingers, Bert Weedon, Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, Tommy Bruce, Michael Cox and Vince Eager.

Their first major hit was \"Sweet Dreams\" on the Columbia label as the backing band to singer Dave Sampson, which reached No. 29 in May 1960. Sampson had written the song whilst at the Curry Bazaar Indian Restaurant in Wardour Street, London West End in October 1959 with friend and neighbour Cliff Richard in mind but record producer Norrie Paramor thought that the song would suit Sampson more. They followed up with a release of their first track \"Teen Scene\" on the Fontana label in the same year, although it did not actually chart. Further releases followed backing Dave Sampson and also without him as instrumentalists in a dual career that spanned 1960 and 1961. Though not denting the UK Singles Chart, the band's singles sold enough for Fontana to grant them an album release in 1961 followed by a second the next year.
