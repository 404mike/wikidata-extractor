His initial selection was principally due to his partnership at Newport with Lloyd, who also made selection for Wales. Lloyd had already played in 1896 against Ireland, and against Scotland and Ireland in 1899. During the game, which Wales won 3\u201313, Phillips displayed 'special smartness' and used 'the acme of judgment' in his first international appearance, proving also to be a 'splendid defender'. He was reckoned to be amongst the best of the backs, and the combination with Lloyd was excellent. In the following match, against  at Swansea on 27 January, the half-back partnership of Phillips and Lloyd continued to perform: their defensive play was 'sound', and in attack, Phillips' 'splendid' fielding and kicking to touch, matched Lloyd's 'cleverness' and 'dodging ability'. Wales was again victorious, 12\u20133. For the next game, away to  at Belfast on 17 March, Lloyd was replaced by Selwyn Biggs of Cardiff. The half-back combination was not as good as with Lloyd but worked better than pundits had expected. The 0\u20133 victory over the Irish earned the Welsh the Triple Crown."]}, {"page": "Fred Parfitt", "response": ["Parfitt played just a single game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship, alongside Selwyn Biggs, in a loss to Scotland.

On this occasion he was partnered with new cap Llewellyn Lloyd, who would become a strong player for Wales and a groundbreaking captain for Newport."]}, {"page": "Daniel Jones (rugby union)", "response": ["Evans first played club rugby for his hometown club of Taibach,Dan Jones player profile Ospreysrugby.com before switching to Aberavon. Although Aberavon was an improving club it was still not a fashionable club to play for and had yet to provide an international player. In 1897 as part of the Home Nations Championship Jones made history for the club by being chosen to represent Wales. The Welsh team had been experiencing several years of unstable partnerships at half-back, and the opening match of the 1897 Championship was no exception, with Jones brought in with veteran player Selwyn Biggs as replacements for Llewellyn Lloyd and Fred Parfitt. The previous season's encounter with England had ended in a humiliating loss for Wales, but with a much changed team, the Welsh were far more competitive in the 1897 game. Wales beat England 11-0, with Jones scoring one of three Welsh tries, the other two coming from Arthur Boucher and Tom Pearson. Jones may have been selected for further games that season, but due to the Gould Affair, Wales left the International Rugby Board and could not play in any further international games. By the time Wales were reinstated, Jones' place had been taken by Cardiff's Jack Elliott, and Jones did not represent his country again."]}, {"page": "Ben Davies (rugby union)", "response": ["Davies played club rugby for first class Welsh team, Llanelli, and it was while representing the 'Scarlets' that he was first selected to play for Wales. Wales had used the Newport half-back pairing of Percy Phillips and Fred Parfitt, but after the retirement of Phillips, the selectors began experimenting with new pairings. The opening game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship against England saw the introduction of two new caps into the half-back positions, Davies and Cardiff's Selwyn Biggs. Despite experienced and talented backs, including Billy Bancroft, Tom Pearson and captain Arthur Gould, the weak forward play from Wales left the backs hamstrung, and the team lost 6-14.Griffiths (1987), 4:7. The next game of the Championship saw the selectors retain Biggs, but Davies was replaced by a returning Fred Parfitt."]}, {"page": "Fred Cornish", "response": ["Born in England in 1876, Cornish is first recorded playing rugby for his hometown club, Bridgwater & Albion. He moved to Wales and joined the Grangetown Stars, but before the end of the century Cornish became a member of first class Welsh team Cardiff RFC, and during the 1896/97 season was selected to play for the Welsh national team, under the two-year residency ruling. Cornish was brought into the pack, along with fellow first caps, Jack Rhapps and Dick Hellings to face England as part of the 1897 Home Nations Championship. Wales won the game in style, but it would be the only international the team would play that year, as an argument broke out between the Home Unions surrounding professionalism, now known as the Gould Affair. The next season, with Arthur Gould now forced into retirement, Wales were readmitted into the Championship. The only two members of the 1897 pack to return for the 1898 Championship were Cornish and Hellings. Despite a large influx of new caps, Cornish was now playing in a Wales squad dominated with his Cardiff team mates; including captain Selwyn Biggs at centre and a threequarters trio of Jones, Nicholls and Huzzey. The Welsh were again victorious winning the opening match against Ireland 11\u20133, but Cornish found himself in a losing international for the first time when Wales lost to England in the final game of the Championship."]}, {"page": "David Morgan (rugby union)", "response": ["Morgan first played international rugby when he was selected for the final game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship in a game against Ireland. Morgan was brought in as a replacement for Cardiff's Selwyn Biggs and was paired at half back with another Cardiff player, Ralph Sweet-Escott. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales faced Ireland in a 'wooden spoon' decider, with both countries having already lost against England and Scotland. Wales won the game 5-3, thanks to an inventive try from Tom Pearson. The next season the Welsh selectors kept faith with Morgan bringing him into the team for the opening game of the 1896 Championship. This time the selectors chose a Llanelli pairing, bringing in Ben Davies, to whom this was also his second international. The match was a sporting disaster for Wales, losing 25-0, and although the forwards took the brunt of the blame, the selectors also reacted by dropping both Morgan and Davies, neither of whom ever represented Wales again."]}, {"page": "Barry Davies (rugby union, born 1875)", "response": ["In 1896 Davies was selected to represent the Wales national rugby team for the Home Nations Championship. Played at the Cardiff Arms Park against Scotland, the team, and the pack in particular saw a massive overhaul after a humiliating loss to England three weeks earlier. Davies was one of five new players brought into the eight man pack, and was joined by two Cardiff team mates in the backs, Nicholls and Selwyn Biggs.
