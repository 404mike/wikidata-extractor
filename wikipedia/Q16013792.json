His career as an actor included many crime-related roles, and in this way paralleled his off-screen life, where he worked as a legal executive for a law firm specialising in criminal law, preparing court briefs.On screen, Anders appeared in small parts in many series, often playing either policemen or criminals. Among these were appearances in such shows as Z-Cars, Softly, Softly, and Juliet Bravo. His first screen appearance was as a prison officer in 1965 in Three Clear Sundays, a play in the \"Wednesday Play\" series. He also appeared on stage throughout England and Scotland during the 1950s and 1960s. His first stage appearance was as an extra in a performance of Shakespeare's Henry V in Birmingham.In 1985, Anders was also introduced into the television show Taggart, playing Superintendent Jack \"The Biscuit\" McVitie, alongside Mark McManus, who played the title character. It is for this role that he is most widely remembered, playing the role in 40 episodes, three of which did not screen until after his death.\nIn his spare time, Anders was an expert at contract bridge, which he taught at the London School of Bridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Taggart", "response": ["The Scottish BAFTA-winning pilot episode \"Killer\", directed by Laurence Moody and broadcast in 1983, introduced the character Detective Chief Inspector Jim Taggart (played by Mark McManus until his death in 1994), a tough and experienced detective who had worked his way up through the ranks. His original sidekick was Detective Sergeant Peter Livingstone (Neil Duncan). Livingstone represented the new breed of young graduates entering the police force and frequently had a difficult relationship with Taggart as a result. Taggart's boss in the pilot was Superintendent Robert Murray (Tom Watson), and his boss after the second episode, \"Dead Ringer\", was Superintendent Jack McVitie (Iain Anders). Another important character was Taggart's wife Jean (Harriet Buchan), whose physical disability did not prevent her from pursuing a number of interests in life, while her cynical husband stuck mainly to his job. Throughout the McManus era, there was nearly always a sub-plot in every episode which involved the domestic life of the Taggarts, which on occasion became intertwined with the case being investigated. The most memorable of these was the Taggarts' ongoing care of Jean's senile Aunt Hettie (Sheila Donald), whom Jim despises and begrudges staying in his house. This sub-plot ran through 1990\u201391 until the Hettie character was killed off in the 1991 season finale, \"Violent Delights, in which her funeral is carried out by a corrupt firm of undertakers who are also the subject of Taggart's investigation.\"", "* Iain Anders as Superintendent Jack  McVitie (1985\u20131998)"]}, {"page": "Mark McManus", "response": ["McManus's final Taggart episode was \"Prayer for the Dead\" (1995).
