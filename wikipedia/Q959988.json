His general characterization of Byzantine society has also on occasion been revived, most notably by Romilly Jenkins.R.J.H. Jenkins, Byzantium and Byzantinism (Cincinnati, 1963). Cf. C. Mango, \"Romilly James Heald Jenkins (1907\u20131969)\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23 (1969), 7-13, esp. 9-10: \"[Jenkins] saw that Byzantium was, on the one hand, the direct ancestor of Russian absolutism, both Czarist and Communist, and, on the other, of nearly everything that he found objectionable in modern Greece.... In this conclusion he had been anticipated by the great German scholar Jacob Philipp Fallmerayer, and to him he proceeded to pay homage in his two famous lectures Byzantium and Byzantinism. His Greek theory was already widely disputed in his lifetime, and is not accepted today. Its primary significance was as a \"strong impetus for research in Byzantine as well as in modern Greek studies.\"starke Impulse f\u00fcr die byzantinistische ebenso wie f\u00fcr die neogr\u00e4zistische Forschung: Hohlweg, \"Fallmerayer\", in Thurnher, ed., Fallmerayer, 65. For a contemporary assessment of the theory, cf. ibid., 64: \"His theory is indeed not entirely false, that is to say, it contains a grain of truth. Only its statement in general and absolute terms, to which Fallmerayer so stubbornly adhered, is false... There were indeed Slavic incursions into Greece and the Peloponnese, but not of the magnitude and also not with the consequences that were alleged by Fallmerayer.\" (Seine theorie ist ja nicht g\u00e4nzlich falsch, d.h. sie enth\u00e4lt einen historischen Kern. Nur die Verallgemeinerung und Verabsolutierung, an welcher Fallmerayer so hartn\u00e4ckig festgehalten hat, ist falsch.... Zwar hat es Slaveneinf\u00e4lle in Griechenland und auf der Peloponnes gegeben, aber nicht in dem Ma\u00dfe und auch nicht mit den Konsequenzen, wie Fallmerayer das behauptet hat.) Early criticisms were published by the Slovene scholar Jernej Kopitar,In K. Hopf, ed., Geschichte Griechenlands vom Beginn des Mittelalters bis auf unsere Zeit (Leipzig, 1867-68). Friedrich Thiersch, Johann Wilhelm Zinkeisen,J.W. Zinkeisen, Geschichte Griechlands vom Anfage geschichtlicher Kunde bis auf unsere Tage Vol. 1 (Leipzig, 1832). and by George Finlay.G. Finlay, History of the Byzantine Empire, numerous editions (e.g. London, 1908).
