Written by award-winning author Ravi Thornton, HOAX is a cross-media project consisting of the stage musical HOAX My Lonely Heart and accompanying graphic novel HOAX Psychosis Blues.  The musical, which was directed by Benji Reid, was described on the Royal Exchange Theatre's website as \"a dark musical fuelled by those most destructive of tendencies: love and self-sabotage\". The story is based on the experiences of Ravi Thornton's younger brother Roabbi (aka Rob) who committed suicide in 2008 at the age of 31, after having suffered a long battle with Schizophrenia.  McGarvey created the music live on stage using a loop pedal, piano and vocal harmonies to accompany the actors who sang the lead parts."]}]}}
