He had the comforting knowledge that, given the circumstances in which his appointment was made, he was to have carte blanche in his dealings with the NUPPO and its officials. Macready did nothing to encourage talks with the union. He refused to recognise both James Marston, the president of NUPPO, and Jack Hayes, the general secretary. As far as Macready was concerned the police had had a grievance that was now settled, and NUPPO remained an unofficial body therefore they were not to be dealt with."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|Jack Hayes"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Jack Hayes, Liverpool Edge Hill, 1923\u201331"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1923 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Jack Hayes"]}, {"page": "List of people from Wolverhampton", "response": ["* Jack Hayes (1887\u20131941) \u2013 police officer, trade unionist and politician; served in the Metropolitan Police, general secretary of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers"]}, {"page": "John Henry Hayes (Labour politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Hayes (politician) "]}, {"page": "1923 Liverpool Edge Hill by-election", "response": ["\"The Liverpool Edge Hill by-election of 1923 was held on 6 March 1923.
