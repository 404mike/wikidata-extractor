He started his career playing for Notts Rangers and Gainsborough Trinity before joining Accrington. He played as an inside forward for Arsenal and scored 10 goals. He also joined Tottenham Hotspur in 1894, but played on one game for them in a friendly, as he decided to returned to Nottingham and joined Nottingham Forest the same year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "North London derby", "response": ["Due to the rivalry between the clubs, relatively few players have played for both Arsenal and Tottenham since 1913. The first player to have played for both clubs, however, predated the start of the rivalry; Bill Julian joined Royal Arsenal in 1889 and Tottenham in 1894. Many other players played for both clubs before the start of the rivalry, including Charles Ambler, Arthur Elliott, Thomas Fitchie, Tom Pratt, Peter Kyle, and George Payne. A number of players had joined both clubs in the 20th century, but it was only in the 1960s that Laurie Brown became the first player to have played in the North London Derby for both clubs. The players who have played for both since 1919 when the rivalry escalated are listed below."]}, {"page": "Arthur Elliot", "response": ["*Arthur Elliott (photographer) (1870\u20131938), South African photographer", "*Arthur Elliott (footballer) (1870\u2013?), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Elliot", "response": ["* Arthur Elliott (born 1870), English footballer"]}]}}
