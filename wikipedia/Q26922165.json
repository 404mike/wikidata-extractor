H. Hardy and P. V. Seshu Aiyar, of Srinivasa Ramanujan's Collected Papers. (It seems probable that Wilson did not know about Ramanujan's lost notebook, which was probably passed by G. H. Hardy to G. N. Watson some years after Wilson's death.)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["*Bertram Martin Wilson (1896\u20131935), English mathematician"]}, {"page": "Bert Wilson", "response": ["* Bertram Martin Wilson (1896\u20131935), English mathematician"]}]}}
