He got a boot in the neck when Leicester's outside-right Frank Large crashed into him and he ended up in hospital and was later discharged to find himself alone without food and transport. Still dressed in his goalkeeper's jersey and without any shoes, Sabu was neglected by Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) officials and help only came in the form of Donald Lightfoot, one of the organizers of the Leicester City trip who bought him some sandals and an air ticket to Ndola. He recovered his clothes from the Director of Sports\u2019 office but after this experience, Sabu quit playing for Zambia.Makayi, Robinson. \"Apologize!
