H. Auden, who worked for many years in India with the Geological Survey of India and later with the Food and Agriculture Organization. He studied the Himalayan strata, particularly the Krol Belt where he recognized rocks from the Peninsula thrusting north into the Himalayas. He also studied groundwater and was involved in studying the geology of many dam sites in India. Auden's Col is named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. H.

H. Auden, pp. 1\u201312. He was the third of three sons; the eldest, George Bernard Auden (1900\u20131978), became a farmer, while the second, John Bicknell Auden (1903\u20131991), became a geologist.The name Wystan derives from the 9th-century St Wystan, who was murdered by Beorhtfrith, the son of Beorhtwulf, king of Mercia, after Wystan objected to Beorhtfrith's plan to marry Wystan's mother. His remains were reburied at Repton, Derbyshire, where they became the object of a cult; the parish church of Repton is dedicated to St Wystan. Auden's father, George Augustus Auden, was educated at Repton School. The Audens were minor gentry with a strong clerical tradition, originally of Rowley Regis, later of Horninglow, Staffordshire.Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th edition, vol. I, ed.
