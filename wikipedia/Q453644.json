Due to his level of documentation, his journal has become an invaluable source for the study of 19th-century Sudanic Africa. Although Barth was not the first European visitor who paid attention to the local oral traditions, he was the first who seriously considered its methodology and use for historical research.

Upon the reception of Richard Lander's report of reaching the mouth of the Niger, enthusiasm for an exploratory team to West Africa grew and the report also rekindled interest in merchants looking for new markets. In 1831, Laird and certain Liverpool merchants formed the African Inland Commercial Company with the objective of the commercial development of the Niger regions, after the lower course of the Niger having been made known that year by Richard Lemon Lander and John Lander."]}, {"page": "Royal Niger Company", "response": ["Richard Lander first explored the area of Nigeria as the servant of Hugh Clapperton.

The expedition failed, with 40 of the 49 members dying of fever or wounds from native attacks. One of the survivors, Macgregor Laird, subsequently remained in Britain but directed and funded expeditions to the country until his death in 1861.

This power vacuum led to the ascendancy of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and Solagberu, the Otun Are-Ona Kakanfo. Shehu Alimi, a Fulani chief who was the leader of the growing Muslim population in Oyo, also rose to power at this time. These new elements had lost regard for the office of the Alaafin due to the various political wranglings and the lack of a central authority at the time; this situation eventually led to Afonja seceding Ilorin from Oyo in 1817 with the help of Oyo Muslims. In 1823, after Afonja had been killed by his erstwhile allies Shehu Alimi and Solagberu (who was himself later killed by Alimi's son), Ilorin became part of the Sokoto Caliphate. By the time Captain Hugh Clapperton visited Oyo-Ile in 1825 during the reign of Alaafin Majotu, the empire was already in a state of decline. Clapperton's party recorded passing numerous Oyo villages burned by the Fulani of Ilorin while Majotu had also sought the help of the English king and the Oba of Benin in putting down the Ilorin rebellion. Clapperton also noticed a shortage of horses, even though the Oyo were renowned as a great cavalry force; this might have something to do with the fact that most of the empire's soldiers and hence cavalry were stationed at Ilorin under the command of Afonja (and later Alimi's successors)."]}, {"page": "European exploration of Africa", "response": ["* Hugh Clapperton (1788\u20131827), explored west and central Africa"]}, {"page": "Captain Hugh Clapperton", "response": ["#redirectHugh Clapperton"]}, {"page": "Clapperton, Hugh", "response": ["#redirectHugh Clapperton"]}, {"page": "Gidado dan Laima", "response": ["Gidado was succeeded by Abd al-Qadir (Sokoto) (1842\u20131859) in 1842.

After his victory, Malam Zaki returned to the area and founded Katagum in 1814.

Valentine Robins, who in 1864 accompanied an expedition up the River Niger aboard , described slavery in the region:  With the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade, demand for slavery in West Africa increased and a number of states became centered on the slave trade and domestic slavery increased dramatically.

In their publication Children and Vigors did not specify where the specimen had been collected but the type locality was later designated as Borno in northeast Nigeria.
