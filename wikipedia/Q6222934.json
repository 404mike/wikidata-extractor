By 1860 Daniel Rowntree Somerset had built the first section of Rosemount (next to Skilmorlie) and the first Oakwal on the hill opposite, but an important early impetus to Windsor's development was the construction of Bowen Bridge across Breakfast Creek in 1861. In 1864 the Chief Justice of Queensland, Sir James Cockle, commissioned a grand new Oakwal on the site of the old, and in the area west of the main northern road (now Lutwyche Road) and south of what is now Newmarket Road down to Breakfast Creek, merchant David L Brown, colonial architect Charles Tiffin, and newspaper proprietor James Swan took up residence in the 1860s. South of the creek, John Bramston had built his house Herston (which gives its name to the suburb of Herston) in 1861 and further upstream, Ballymore was constructed in 1864 for Lieutenant DJ Seymour. When Skilmorlie and its sister house Fernfield were erected in 1873, there appear to have been two other early residences to the south of them, on the eastern side of Bowen Bridge Road (now Lutwyche Road). Of these mid-19th century Windsor/Herston residences, only Oakwal and the two Bryden homes survive. (The present Rosemount was constructed in the 1890s.) In terms of surviving 1860s/1870s buildings in the Windsor district (and for that matter Brisbane), Skilmorlie and Fernfield are very significant."]}, {"page": "Charles Haly", "response": ["On 6 April 1869, Robert Mackenzie, former Premier and member for Burnett, retired from politics and departed for Europe.

Born in Morayshire, Scotland in 1815, he emigrated to Australia in 1839 arriving in Sydney aboard the Earl Durham. In the 1840s he worked in the pastoral industry and as a merchant before moving to Brisbane in 1851. In Brisbane he soon established George Raff & Co., a shipping company with wharves on the Brisbane River situated adjacent to Customs House. Raff also founded the Queensland Mercantile and Agency Co., and became a director of the Queensland Steam Navigation Company in 1861. He strongly believed in separation from New South Wales and was one of the 26 members of Sir Robert Herbert's first Queensland Parliament. In 1860 Raff was appointed as a member of the Board of Education. He handed in his resignation as Member of the Legislative Assembly to the speaker of parliament in April 1864. He was re-elected and served again from November 1865, including a period as minister without portfolio in the Herbert and later Macalister ministries until November 1866.
