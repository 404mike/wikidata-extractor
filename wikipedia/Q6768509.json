Their run put them nine points clear at the top of the table. At the end of February, Southall was recalled, and Stoke refused to loan back Harrison as cover. Wolverhampton Wanderers' Andy Poole proved to be an inadequate replacement. Vale then lost Greenhoff to Rochdale, who offered him the vacant management post. Lol Hamlett's last match as trainer (he retired due to illness) was a 2\u20130 defeat to Blackpool at Bloomfield Road, as Vale were in danger of failing to win promotion. McGrath decided to sign striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, and loaned Mark Lawrence from Hartlepool United. Siddall returned and so did Vale's form, as they recorded five victories in seven games. Ernie Moss left for Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee, McGrath saying 'age caught up with him'. Wimbledon ran away with the championship, though Vale managed to secure promotion with a 2\u20130 win over Stockport County at Edgeley Park on 6 May. The jubilant players seemed distracted in the final two games, and their two defeats allowed Hull City to take the runners-up spot.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Lawrence", "| March 1983 || MF ||  || Mark Lawrence || Hartlepool United || May 1983 || "]}]}}
