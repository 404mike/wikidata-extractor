He was a popular figure at Maine Road due to his strong team ethic, loyalty to the cause and an ever-ready smile, qualities that were to serve him well in his later coaching and management career.Fagan & Platt, p. 20. His friend Frank Swift gave him the nickname \"Patsy\", a reference to the Irish folk song Hallo Patsy Fagan.Fagan & Platt, p. 21. In a match in November 1947, Fagan met his future colleague Bob Paisley for the first time when they played against each other in City's 2\u20130 win over Liverpool at Maine Road. City finished tenth that season, one place above Liverpool.Fagan & Platt, p. 22. In 1948\u201349, under new manager Jock Thomson, City finished seventh.", "In the 1948\u201349 season, Fagan was again an ever-present as City finished seventh under new manager Jock Thomson. The 1949\u201350 season was a poor one for City and, with two thirds of the matches played, City had won only five. Thomson was dismissed and, at the end of season, the club were relegated. In 1951, he sustained a broken leg and, aged 30, was forced to consider his future career options. He had played in 138 games for City and scored two goals. He decided to leave City and take up coaching."]}]}}
