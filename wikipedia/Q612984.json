He is married with a daughter and works as a managing director of an advertising and marketing agency in Leicester and as a part-time BBC Sport summariser. \nHe marked the start of his career with impressive try scoring feats (2 on debut and another in his second test) but was controversially dropped from the England side after his 3rd test in favour of Tony Underwood following the 10-9 loss to Wales.\nHe did not feature regularly for the England side after that but played numerous games for Northampton Saints and was selected for the 1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand.  However, injury cruelly struck on the Lions Tour and he was the first player sent home through injury when he dislocated his shoulder in a tackle in the first game against Northland.\nHis seventh and final appearance for England came against France in the 1995 World Cup.\nHis shoulder never properly healed enough to stand the demands of top class rugby and he retired from the game in 2001. \nIan was noted throughout his career for being remarkably fit - in 1993 he finished top of the England Squad on the much-vaunted VO2 test.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Hunter", "response": ["Ian Hunter may refer to:", "* Ian Hunter (actor) (1900\u20131975), South African-born British actor", "* Ian Hunter (artist) (1939\u20132017), British artist and Dean of Saint Martin's School of Art", "* Ian Hunter (cricketer) (born 1979), British cricketer", "* Ian Hunter (impresario) (1919\u20132003), British classical music and talent promoter", "* Ian Hunter (politician) (born 1960), South Australian Labor Party politician", "* Ian Hunter (rugby union) (born 1969), English rugby player and media marketer", "* Ian Hunter (Scottish footballer) (fl. 1960s), Scottish footballer (Falkirk)", "* Ian Hunter (singer) (born 1939), English singer-songwriter, former frontman of Mott the Hoople", "** Ian Hunter (album), his debut 1975 solo album", "* Ian Hunter (soccer) (born 1961), Australian footballer", "* Ian Hunter (visual effects supervisor), visual effects artist "]}, {"page": "Northampton Saints", "response": ["Tim Rodber and Ian Hunter forced their way into the England setup while younger players such as Paul Grayson, Matt Dawson and Nick Beal came through the ranks and would follow the duo into the England senior team.", "| Martin Bayfield, Ian Hunter, Tim Rodber", "* Ian Hunter (1993)"]}, {"page": "1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand", "response": ["|Ian Hunter||Northampton||||", "|Richard Wallace||Garryowen||||Replacement for Ian Hunter"]}, {"page": "Ian Hunter (rugby)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Hunter (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|1144||Ian Hunter||wing ||1992-10-17||v Canada at Wembley"]}, {"page": "Ian Hunter (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Hunter (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Pilkington Cup", "response": ["| ||15|| Ian Hunter"]}, {"page": "Carlisle RFC", "response": ["The introduction of the leagues in the 1986\u201387 season saw Carlisle placed in North West Division 2 - a league at tier 8 of the English rugby union system.
