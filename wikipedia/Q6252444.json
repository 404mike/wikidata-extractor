In 1863 Lyne acquired premises on Elm Hill, Norwich, in face of local opposition. Special masses were celebrated for the community by the sympathetic vicar in St Laurence's Church, Norwich, at Lyne's instigation, produced further conflicts between him and the bishop. Lyne's appeal for support to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce only elicited a recommendation of submission. Forcing himself upon public notice by addressing the Bristol Church Congress of 1863, he could only secure a hearing through the interposition of Bishop Charles Ellicott. His life in Norwich was varied by a mission to London and by quarrels within the community. In 1866, owing to a flaw in the title-deeds, Lyne found himself dispossessed of his Elm Hill property, and he moved to a house in Chale, Isle of Wight, lent him by Pusey. In 1867 he moved to Laleham and in Feltham nearby he started anonther Anglican religious order, a Benedictine enclosed convent for women, who subsequently entered into full communion with the Roman Catholic Church."]}, {"page": "John Pelham", "response": ["John Pelham may refer to:", "*John Pelham (English parliamentarian), MP for Sussex", "*John Pelham (bishop) (1811\u20131894), British Bishop of Norfolk", "*John Pelham (officer) (1838\u20131863), Confederate artillery officer", "*Sir John Pelham, 3rd Baronet (1623\u20131703), MP for Sussex", "*John Pelham, 8th Earl of Chichester (1912\u20131944), Earl of Chichester", "*John Pelham, 9th Earl of Chichester (born 1944), Earl of Chichester"]}, {"page": "St Marylebone Parish Church", "response": ["*1855\u20131857 John Pelham (later Bishop of Norwich)"]}]}}
