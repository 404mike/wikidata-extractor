Skinner, FRHistS (born 1965) is a British historian and academic, specialising in Medieval Europe. She is currently Professor of History at Swansea University. She was previously Reader in Medieval History at the University of Winchester and Lecturer in Humanities at the University of Southampton. She has published extensively on the social history of southern Italy and health and medicine. With Dr Emily Cock, she started the project \"Effaced from History: Facial Difference and its Impact from Antiquity to the Present Day\" to study the history of facial disfigurement.Skinner received her PhD in Medieval History from the University of Birmingham in 1990. Her thesis on the Duchy of Gaeta was published in 1995 as Family Power in Southern Italy. In 1997, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS). She has been co-editor of Social History of Medicine since 2014, and a member of the council of the Royal Historical Society since 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eadwig", "response": ["Eadwig is known for his remarkable generosity in giving away land. In 956 alone, his sixty odd gifts of land make up around 5% of all genuine Anglo-Saxon charters. No known ruler in Europe matched that yearly total before the twelfth century, and his cessions are plausibly attributed to political insecurity.Chris Wickham, 'Problems in Doing Comparative History', pp. 19\u201320, in Challenging the Boundaries of Medieval History: The Legacy of Timothy Reuter, Patricia Skinner, ed, Brepols 2009."]}, {"page": "Dagobert of Pisa", "response": ["Historians have generally been highly critical of Dagobert's conduct in the Holy Land. Steven Runciman in his history of the First Crusade, describes him as vigorous, but vain, ambitious, dishonest and easily influenced. In a 1998 study Michael Matzke defended Dagobert, arguing that his actions as patriarch were motivated by religious idealism, and that he was trying to carry out the intentions of Pope Urban. Historians have strongly disagreed whether this rehabilitation is convincing. Patricia Skinner, in her survey of Dagobert's career, accepts that he acted against canon law, but argues that in the exceptional circumstances of the time, he had to act pragmatically."]}, {"page": "Duchy of Gaeta", "response": ["The Docibilian dynasts regularly worked to advance Gaetan interests through alliance with whatever power was most capable of such at the time.

They constructed a massive palace and greatly increased the city's prestige and wealth. The Gaetans remained nominally Byzantine in allegiance until the mid tenth century, fighting under their banner at the Battle of the Garigliano. The chief success of the Docibilians lay, however, in extracting Gaeta from the Ducatus Neapolitanus.", "The city of Gaeta was always the economic, political, and ecclesiastical centre of the duchy. The probable origins of the Docibilan dynasty as Amalfitan merchants perhaps explains the interest they had in amassing movable as well as landed wealth. The Gaetan forum (market) was located near the ducal palace. Warehouses (medialocae), some even owned by foreigners, like Pisans, were commonplace.Medialoca was Latin for \"middle place\" and probably indicated the middle storey of a three-floor structure, where the ground and top floors were open shops and living quarters, respectively, c.f. Patricia Skinner (1995), \"Politics and Piracy: the Duchy of Gaeta in the Twelfth Century,\" Journal of Medieval History, 21, 309. In the tenth century Gaetans, Amalfitans, and Salernitans were present cum magno negotio (\"with great business\") in Pavia. At Constantinople the Gaetans had a colony. Liutprand of Cremona even records that the deposers of Romanus II claimed the support of the \"men of Caieta\" and Amalfi. While it is known that Amalfi imported Byzantine silk, a single reference to \"Gaetan silk\" in a will of 1028 suggests that Gaeta may have been involved in its production.Skinner, \"Politics and Piracy\", 310. A cloak bearing an eagle, a common imperial symbol, mentioned in this same will may indicate the presence of Byzantine textiles industry in Gaeta. By 1129 the Jewish community at Gaeta was heavily involved in the industries of cloth-dyeing, salt extraction, and olive oil production.Skinner, \"Politics and Piracy\", 314."]}, {"page": "Timothy Reuter", "response": ["The collection Challenging the Boundaries of Medieval History: The Legacy of Timothy Reuter, edited by Patricia Skinner, was published in 2009 as volume 22 in the University of York Studies in the Early Middle Ages (Brepols, Turnhout, Belgium)."]}, {"page": "Gregory IV of Naples", "response": ["In 907 Gregory made a donation to the urban church of Saints Severinus and Sossus in Naples, which his forefathers had possibly founded.Patricia Skinner, \"Urban Communities in Naples, 900\u20131050\", Papers of the British School at Rome 62 (1994), 289."]}, {"page": "John III of Naples", "response": ["In 949, John made a donation to the church of Saints Severinus and Sossus, which had possibly been founded by one of his predecessors.

When Ehremar heard about this, he went to Rome, but he arrived to find his rival had died. Paschal was then inclined to re-appoint Ehremar, but king Baldwin had become dissatisfied with him, considering him inefficient. Baldwin sent Arnulf of Chocques, who had himself been displaced as patriarch in favour of Dagobert in 1099, to oppose Ehremar. Paschal sent Ghibbelin of Arles, Archbishop of Arles, to Jerusalem as legate to decide the matter. Ghibbelin found that Ehremar was unfitted for the position and declared it vacant, and Baldwin then proposed Ghibbelin himself as patriarch. He accepted and Ehremar was compensated with the Archbishopric of Caesarea.Runciman, op. cit., pp. 84-85. The date of these events is unclear. According to Runciman, Dagobert went to Rome in 1105, but did not die until 1107 and Ehremar's replacement by Ghibbelin took place in spring 1108, but Patricia Skinner corrected the date of Dagobert's death to 1105.
