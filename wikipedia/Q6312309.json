Bidmead all protested about John Nathan-Turner's decision to add question-marks to Baker's shirts, arguing that it was gimmicky. Baker in particular was unhappy with it and told Nathan-Turner that it was \"annoying, absurd and ridiculous\", while Bidmead later called it \"a silly, quite absurd gimmick really\". Bidmead, who found working with Tom Baker \"difficult to say the very least\", supposedly told Baker and Nathan-Turner during recording of The Leisure Hive that exclamation marks would have been more appropriate for Baker's shirts. The Seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy would later protest his question-mark adorned jumper in similar terms, but the question-mark motif would remain until the end of the classic series in 1989. Baker also disliked his new scarf, requesting that his old multi-coloured one be re-instated, but expressed gratitude to costume designer June Hudson for refusing to adhere to Nathan-Turner's demands to ditch the trademark scarf altogether and managing to find a compromise."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Doctor Who lists", "response": ["We seriously need a list for important Doctor Who crew members.
