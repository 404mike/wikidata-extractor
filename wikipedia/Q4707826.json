He made a total of 386 appearances in the Football league for Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Fulham and Portsmouth. At the end of his career, he played for Durban United in South Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trevor Brooking", "response": ["In June 1967, Brooking made his senior debut in a friendly for West Ham against Grasshopper Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland. His league debut came in place of wide-right Brian Dear on 29 August 1967 in a 3\u20133 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor. His first goal came on 26 December 1967 in a 4\u20132 away win at Leicester City. His first season saw him play 28 games, scoring nine goals. His second season saw 37 appearances and eight goals. His only hat-trick came on 6 April 1968 in a 5\u20130 home defeat of Newcastle. In December 1969, during his third season, Brooking chipped a bone in his ankle in a game against Nottingham Forest. The club signed Peter Eustace for \u00a390,000 to take his place; his recovery took longer than expected, and he considered giving up the game. However, he returned to playing and with the departure of Martin Peters to Tottenham in March 1970, Brooking became a regular in midfield. His place in the side came under threat in the 1971\u201372 season with the purchase of midfielder Tommy Taylor, and Brooking was transfer-listed at his own request. However, the failure of the defensive partnership between Bobby Moore and Alan Stephenson saw Stephenson dropped and Taylor being moved into defence; Brooking remained an ever-present for the rest of the season and was voted Hammer of the Year. During the 1972\u201373 season he came to the attention of Derby County manager Brian Clough, who offered West Ham \u00a3400,000 for Brooking and Moore, but Greenwood refused to let the pair leave. Again, in 1974 Tottenham manager Bill Nicholson offered \u00a3425,000 for the signature of Brooking. According to Brooking in his autobiography, this move was not pursued as he felt Nicholson, a manager he admired, was coming to the end of his Tottenham career and he was unsure of which manager would follow him."]}, {"page": "List of West Ham United F.C. players", "response": ["| Alan Stephenson"]}, {"page": "John McCormick (footballer, born 1936)", "response": ["Palace manager Bert Head paid just \u00a31,500 for McCormick's services, on 30 May 1966. White had been Head's main target but it was McCormick, after initially understudying Alan Stephenson, who helped the club to its promotion to the First Division for the first time in 1968\u201369. In that season, McCormick was ever present making 42 appearances and scoring 3 times. In the top flight he formed a solid defensive partnership with fellow centre-half Mel Blyth and won Palace's first ever \"Player of the Year\" award at the end of the 1971-72 season. He was awarded a testimonial during the next season."]}, {"page": "List of Crystal Palace F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Alan Stephenson||||CB||1961\u20131968||185||13||style=\"background:#3f9;\"|1966||"]}, {"page": "Alan Stevens", "response": ["* Alan Stephenson (born 1944), former footballer"]}, {"page": "Crystal Palace F.C.
