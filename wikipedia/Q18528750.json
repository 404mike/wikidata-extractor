He proceeded to join a dance band, where he witnessed an early brass band competition. In 1851 he arranged a contest in Kingston upon Hull, but his first success came in 1853 at Manchester's Belle Vue Zoological Gardens, where he helped organise a successful contest of brass bands. He began writing test pieces and in 1860 was approached to run a competition at The Crystal Palace in London. This event proved highly successful, and ran annually until 1863.\nFollowing the Crystal Palace contests, he toured the world with a variety of groups and acts, acting both as a manager and musical director. He then retired to Scarborough to paint and write articles on music, and eventually died on Good Friday, 1903. In his articles, he stated that his mission throughout his life was \"the propagation of music amongst the working classes\".:\u200a576\u200a", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1903 in music", "response": ["**Enderby Jackson, pioneer of the British brass band, 76"]}, {"page": "1827 in music", "response": ["*January 14 \u2013 Enderby Jackson, pioneer of the British brass band (d. 1903)"]}, {"page": "John Jackson", "response": ["* John Enderby Jackson (1827\u20131903), English musician and composer"]}, {"page": "List of Anglican church composers", "response": ["*Enderby Jackson"]}, {"page": "1827 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 14 January \u2013 Enderby Jackson, pioneer of the British brass band (died 1903)"]}, {"page": "1903 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 10 April \u2013 Enderby Jackson, pioneer of the British brass band (born 1827)"]}, {"page": "Pearson Park", "response": ["On 28 August 1860 the park was inaugurated.

A ceremony involving the deed of conveyance took place, and the Mayor, Zachariah Pearson then planted a tree, a Wellingtonia Gigantea. Celebrations were continued at the Station Hotel, with a dinner and fireworks display, and to the next day, with further ceremonial tree planting."]}, {"page": "Besses o' th' Barn Band", "response": ["The costs associated with operating a brass band in the 19th century included providing and maintaining instruments, uniforms and rehearsal facilities, as well as purchasing sheet music and paying conductors for their services. While a few bands were able to obtain patronage from wealthy sponsors, most relied on membership subscriptions, public appeals and concerts for their income. The latter was particularly significant but noteworthy institutions such as Besses and the Black Dyke Band earned large sums from participating in contests. Although there had been a few contests before 1850, they came to the fore after that time and owe much to the enterprise of Enderby Jackson, a man who promoted contests and liaised with railway companies to provide excursion arrangements for the contestants and spectators. Entrants to contests were expected not to be professional musicians, but participants for bands such as Besses supplemented their income with payments received for playing."]}, {"page": "Harry Braham", "response": ["After having success in the early music halls in Sydney, in June 1872 Braham met Lizzie Watson, born Eliza Stephenson (c. 1840 \u2013 17 February 1913), an Irish serio-comic and Burlesque actress ten years his senior. Watson was the headline star of Harry Rickards and Enderby Jackson's music hall touring company. Watson parted company acrimoniously from Rickards to start up her own company with Braham. They married on 6 February 1873 in Brisbane, and sailed from there to Sydney in April."]}, {"page": "John Enderby Jackson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Enderby Jackson"]}, {"page": "Cyfarthfa Band", "response": ["During this time, the band played various shows at the Crawshay's Cyfarthfa Castle estate and around Merthyr, from weddings to flower shows. They entered Enderby Jackson's 1860 contest at The Crystal Palace and won the second day's event. The band continued until the early 20th century, when it was taken over by the council as the Cyfarthfa and Merthyr Municipal Band.", "In 1860, the band took part in Enderby Jackson's contest at The Crystal Palace, believed to be its first competitive pursuit. The band played in both the National and Sydenham contest, coming third in the former. After playing the required set of quadrilles composed by Jackson, and an arrangement of the overture to Verdi's opera Nabucco, the band won the latter contest. Crawshay was elevated as a cultural figure, however he had little knowledge of music and was effectively deaf from 1859."]}]}}
