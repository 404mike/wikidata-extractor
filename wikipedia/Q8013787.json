He came into the orbit of John Newton, a significant influence, at St Mary Woolnoth. Newton tried in 1795 to bring him to St Helen's Bishopsgate, but failed, because of local resistance. In 1796 Gunn became Newton's curate at St Mary Woolnoth. Newton found Gunn both popular with his congregation and humble; but noted that Gunn was even more unpopular with the wider clergy than evangelicals generally were. Joseph Irons, father of William Josiah Irons, who became an itinerant preacher, was converted by Gunn's preaching, around 1803. Another impressed by Gunn was Jacob Kirkman Foster, who became a Cheshunt College tutor. An opponent took the chance to criticise Gunn for his use of snuff."]}]}}
