This vocal version charted #15 on the UK Singles Chart, and although a music video was created, it was rarely broadcast due to its controversial lyrical content.", "\"Everything Starts with an 'E was initially produced as an instrumental dance record with assorted samples by Jimi Hendrix, Lost in Space and from classical music. It was written by Healy immediately after his first trip to Ibiza, where the acid house movement was in full swing, as Healy's and Rogers' interpretation of house music at the time having taken heavy inspiration from the music being played there. The title, \"Everything Starts with an 'E, originated from a Ronald McDonald LP which contained the line and was subsequently sampled in the song. Healy then presented it to Boy George, who suggested they use MC Kinky, a white female raggamuffin toaster who had previously featured on his song Kipsy. She then used the song to write what according to her was an anti-drug rant. Boy George and Eve Gallagher both provide backing vocals for the record. It was rejected by every label George went to and eventually he opted to front the money himself, pressing a thousand copies with the intent to get it played in the clubs. Its first play was in the Hacienda in Manchester, and after becoming a theme for many of the raves, Virgin Records surrendered and signed the band. Although BBC Radio 1 initially banned the song due to controversial lyrical content, it was performed on the Sky1 show Hits International, and would later chart at #15 on the UK Singles Chart, remaining the flagship for George's More Protein label as well as an anthem for the entire acid house movement of the late 1980s. It later appeared on E-Zee Possee's album The Bone Dance alongside follow-up singles \"Love On Love\", \"The Sun Machine\" and \"Breathing Is E-Zee\" as well as on Now That's What I Call Music! 17. After the earlier ban, the song was played on BBC stations at various times in 2010 and later.E.g.: Dave Pearce, BBC Radio 6, 21 March 2010, \"Dave Pearce Meets Boy George\", BBC Radio 6, 16 July 2011, Dave Pearce, BBC Radio 2, 12 May 2012, "]}, {"page": "More Protein", "response": ["*Eve Gallagher"]}, {"page": "Bruck Dawit", "response": ["* Eve Gallagher, Frankie Knuckles Def Mix Productions"]}, {"page": "The Unrecoupable One Man Bandit", "response": ["*Eve Gallagher \u2013 vocals"]}]}}
