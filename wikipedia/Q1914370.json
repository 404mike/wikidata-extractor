The car made its debut at the 2020 Philadelphia Auto Show. The vehicle is limited to 100 examples. On October 10, 2020, driver Oliver Webb allegedly broke the production car speed record in the SSC Tuatara with a top speed of 331.15 miles per hour and a 2-way average of 316.11 mph on a closed public roadway with street tires and non-race fuel. The claim, however, has since been disputed by several sources who analyzed the video and information given from SSC North America and have since made claims that the top speed run was illegitimate. On January 17, 2021, Tuatara owner and non-professional driver Larry Caplin officially broke the speed record for fastest production vehicle with an average 2-way average speed of 282.9 mph on a 2.5 mile stretch of runway at Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility. The claim was verified by Race Logic, with a technician onsite to install and analyze the data.  SSC has stated that it plans on continuing high speed testing to validate the top speed of the Tuatara and hopes to be the first production car to reach and surpass 300 mph."]}, {"page": "Pierre Kaffer", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Simon Trummer Oliver Webb"]}, {"page": "Fortec Motorsport", "response": ["|  Oliver Webb", "|  Oliver Webb", "|  Oliver Webb"]}, {"page": "Bruno Spengler", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Oliver Webb Tom Dillmann"]}, {"page": "2007 Formula BMW UK season", "response": ["|  Oliver Webb", "|align=left style=\"background:#8FCFDF;\"|  Oliver Webb"]}, {"page": "Arrow McLaren SP", "response": ["|align=left| Oliver Webb"]}, {"page": "1000 km Zeltweg", "response": ["|  Paul-Loup Chatin Nelson Panciatici Oliver Webb"]}, {"page": "Nelson Panciatici", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Paul-Loup Chatin Oliver Webb"]}, {"page": "2007 Formula Renault seasons", "response": ["| Oliver Webb"]}, {"page": "Eric Jensen (racing driver)", "response": ["Jensen MotorSport continues to operate race cars in several professional race series.
