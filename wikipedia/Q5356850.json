After all the celebrities have appeared they all stand in a circle. The backdrop then disappears to reveal a snowy landscape with carol singers and sledgers gathering round them. They all sing together and look up into the sky. The circle is blurred out and large snowflakes start to fall from the sky as the logo forms. A news version was made which cut straight to the blurred out circle. Shortened versions were made, which showed a group of celebrities before cutting to a cake to make the circle. All variants featured instrumental music used in the main ident. The ident package originally debuted as a trailer 30 November after programmes until the ident was first shown on Saturday 10 December at 17:35. A version was made to promote The Gruffalo's Child movie, with the two main characters playing in the snow. The same music is used.https://theident.gallery/player.php?id=BBC1-2011-XMAS-ID-GRUFFALO-1 The Gruffalo also appears in the window in the main \"Consider Yourself\" advert.
