At the age of 16 his family emigrated to New Zealand, settling in Southland. In 1864 he was appointed Meteorological Director of Southland Province, a position he held until 1870. He was employed as a journalist with The Evening Post in Wellington about 1876 and was later editor, resigning in 1884. He was editor of The New Zealand Times, also in Wellington, from 1885 to 1890. In that year he was appointed London correspondent for a number of leading New Zealand newspapers in the New Zealand Associated Press, which he continued to do until shortly before he died.He took a close interest in railways over many years and in 1884 and 1885 he did a thorough study of the British rail network, involving around 40,000 miles of travel. In 1887 the results were embodied in a report to the New Zealand Minister of Public Works entitled Notes on the Railways of Great Britain, which received favourable reviews.He is chiefly known for recording a speed of 102.3 mph on the 'Ocean Mail' special from Plymouth to London hauled by GWR locomotive 3440 City of Truro on 9 May 1904, the first time that a steam locomotive was recorded to have achieved 100 mph.\nBetween the years of 1902 and 1908 he wrote a series of articles for The Railway Magazine on British locomotive practice and performance. In 1990, these were collated and reprinted in book form.He married Miss Emily Jane Hickson in 1876; there were no children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "GWR 4000 Class", "response": ["During initial trials the prototype proved to be largely successful although Charles Rous-Marten commented that 'there were indications that with heavier loads, and less favourable weather, greater adhesion would be needed.'

One Christchurch paper suggested that they needed a glass case to protect them from the weather. They looked flimsy because of the bar frames  rather than the heavier plate frames of the Js. In addition, this first pair, K 87 \"Lincoln\" and K 88 \"Washington\", reputedly wore a kaleidoscope of colours \u2013 green, blue, yellow, red, purple, and gold in addition to their Russian Iron boiler jackets. The Baldwin and Rogers locomotives reflected the styling adopted in the 1870s by American builders with elements from the Renaissance Revival and Neo-Baroque architectural styles, and with Islamic Moorish (from Alhambra) influences.

On a trial run, Charles Rous-Marten timed one as running from Upper Hutt to Wellington, a distance of 20 miles, in 32.5 minutes despite a number of short delays amounting to three minutes; one section of two miles was covered at a maximum speed of 53 miles per hour.  They were allocated to depots across the country, and during their working life operated almost all types of services from premier passenger trains to shunting tasks.  As built, they could carry 716 gallons of water, but to allow them to operate over extended distances, some were later fitted with 900 gallon side tanks.  All were reboilered during their lives to raise the boiler pressure from 130 to 160 pounds per square inch."]}, {"page": "1842 in New Zealand", "response": ["* (unknown date): Charles Rous-Marten, journalist and railway writer (in England)"]}, {"page": "Wellington Bank, Somerset", "response": ["On 9 May 1904, whilst descending Wellington Bank, the GWR 3700 Class No. 3440 City of Truro was timed at 8.8 seconds between two quarter-mile posts, whilst hauling the \"Ocean Mails\" special from Plymouth to London Paddington.
