Craig", "response": ["After missing out on the first two months of the 1890\u201391 season, Craig made his return at inside left in a 1\u20130 defeat to Bootle in the second qualifying round of the 1890\u201391 FA Cup after both sides agreed to use their reserve teams.Shury and Landamore (2005), p. 52. The following week, he filled in at left-half and scored in a 6\u20133 Football Alliance win at home to Crewe Alexandra, after both Jack Owen and Jack Doughty were ruled out. The following week, in a 2\u20131 defeat away to Walsall Town Swifts, Bob Milarvie took over at left-half and Craig took Milarvie's place at outside left. After missing the next two games, he returned to the team for the remainder of the Alliance season, playing mostly at centre-forward in the absence of George Evans, though he played one game at left-half at home to Small Heath on 13 December 1890 and at inside right against Stoke on 5 January 1891. He scored one more goal in the Alliance in 1890\u201391, Newton Heath's only goal in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Sheffield Wednesday on 21 February 1891. Craig also played in both of Newton Heath's Lancashire Senior Cup matches that season, scoring in the 4\u20133 win over Witton in the first round on 7 February 1891, before a 3\u20131 defeat to Preston North End after extra time in the second round. He also played in both the semi-final and the final of the Manchester Senior Cup, scoring in the 3\u20131 win over Stockport County in the semi-final on 21 March 1891. He left the club at the end of the 1890\u201391 season."]}]}}
