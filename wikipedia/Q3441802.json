In 1953, Morecambe & Wise made an appearance on the television show Stars in Blackpool, which led to them meeting Waldman, who started forming plans for the duo to headline their own television series.McCann, p.100 However, although the duo had performed in Southern England on the variety circuit,Morecambe and Sterling, p. 51 their broadcasting career had largely taken place in Northern England, which led BBC producers to suggest that their act might not work with southern audiences.McCann, p. 103 Bryan Sears, who was assigned as the new show's producer, eventually attached a group of six writers to the production, which received the title Running Wild. The series was given an initial run of six episodes, to be broadcast live fortnightly from the BBC Television Theatre in Shepherd's Bush.McCann, p. 106", "Such was the impact of that review that Eric Morecambe carried a copy of it with him for the rest of his life. The poor reception that the first show received, combined with only minor improvements in the quality for the second and third episodes, led to Morecambe and Wise suggesting to Ronnie Waldman that the remainder of the series be cancelled.McCann, p. 111 In spite of their reservations, Waldman remained steadfast in his confidence in the duo and the production, and it eventually ran for the full six episodes. The Reaction Index, an indicator of the audience's approval of a television programme, given as a score out of 100, had slowly increased over the course of the series,McCann, p. 112 while the reviews had improved. Nevertheless, the criticism that the duo had personally received meant that their personal morale and enthusiasm had evaporated by the end of the run."]}]}}
