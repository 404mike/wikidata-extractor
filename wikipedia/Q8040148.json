These include Jean-Louis Forain (who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1879, 1880, 1881 and 1886) and Giuseppe De Nittis, an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work.Denvir (1990), p.152. Federico Zandomeneghi was another Italian friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists. Eva Gonzal\u00e8s was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. James Abbott McNeill Whistler was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. Walter Sickert, an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer Wynford Dewhurst wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development, which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.", "* Wynford Dewhurst, Walter Richard Sickert, and Philip Wilson Steer were well known Impressionist painters from the United Kingdom. Pierre Adolphe Valette, who was born in France but who worked in Manchester, was the tutor of L. S. Lowry."]}, {"page": "Manchester Art Gallery", "response": ["The gallery houses several works by the French impressionist, Pierre Adolphe Valette, who painted and taught in Manchester in the early years of the 20th century; some of his scenes of foggy Manchester streets and canals are displayed. A C\u00e9zanne hangs in the same room, showing the similarity in treatment and subject between his misty French river bridge and Valette's bridge in a pre-Clean Air Act Mancunian fog. L. S. Lowry was one of Valette's students and the influence on Lowry of impressionism can be seen at the gallery, where paintings by the two artists hang together.  The museum houses The Picnic (1908), a work by the British Impressionist painter Wynford Dewhurst, who was born in Manchester."]}, {"page": "National Museum Cardiff", "response": ["The collection of 20th-century art includes works by sculptors Jacob Epstein, Herbert Ward and Eric Gill and painters including Stanley Spencer, the British Impressionist Wynford Dewhurst, L.

He was the son of a newspaper editor. Antoine Paul Jules Edgar Pouget,  a nature lover, encouraged William in his ambition to become an artist. The two would often take long walks together, the elder pointing out natural phenomena while discussing methods of their pictorial representation. He related biographical details of the great artists, past and present, and in every possible way trained the boy while rousing his ambition.Wynford Dewhurst, Impressionist Painting, Its Genesis and Development, London: Geoge Newnes Limited, 1904, Chapter X, \"La Peinture Claire: Glaus, Le Sidaner, Besnard, Didier-Pouget,\" pp. 85-87, 102.", "Didier-Pouget excelled in depicting morning and sunset effects. \"His scenes of heather bathed in sunshine or glistening with the dew of an autumnal sunrise are rendered with an exceptional verisimilitude, strength, and truth\", wrote Wynford Dewhurst in 1901.Wynford Dewhurst, The International Studio (The Studio), 1901, The Work of Didier-Pouget, Landscape Painter, Issue: 94, p. 247", "Wynford Dewhurst wrote again of Didier-Pouget in 1904: \"If the greatest art is to represent an impression of Nature at her best, then the work of Didier-Pouget is great. 'It is truly worth while being a painter to have produced any one of these,' writes the critic of Le Temps. The artist loves best to represent Nature in her peaceful moods, and generally seeks the solitudes of the exquisite hills, valleys, and rivers of the Tarbes countryside, or the rich watershed of La Creuse. Here, in the fresh early-morn, charged with dew and mist, he finds his subjects, overlooking magnificent panoramas of river, hillsides covered with heather, across valleys and plains from which loom out sculpturesque masses of foliage, dark and strong against the blue mist and distant mountain ridge. The painter prefers Nature serene and undisturbed, and introduces but little incident.\""]}, {"page": "List of artists in the Web Gallery of Art (A\u2013K)", "response": ["*Wynford Dewhurst (1864\u20131941), 1 painting : Luncheon on the Grass (Picnic), City Art Gallery, Manchester (url)"]}, {"page": "List of pupils of Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me", "response": ["*Wynford Dewhurst, R.B.A."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Manchester history", "response": ["* 1864 \u2013 26 January: Wynford Dewhurst, Impressionist painter (d. 1941)"]}]}}
