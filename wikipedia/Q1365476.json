The end of the 1970s featured a ska revival in the UK. By the end of the '70s, a revival movement had begun in England, with such bands as the Specials, Madness, the (English) Beat, and the Selecter.

The 2 Tone movement referenced reggae's godfathers, popular styles (including the genre's faster and more dance-oriented precursors, ska and rocksteady), and previous modes of dress (such as black suits and porkpie hats) but updated the sound with a faster tempo, more guitar, and more attitude.Stemkovsky, I.

It was recorded during summer 1980 at Coventry's Horizon Studios and mixed at Wessex Studios in London. In contrast to the first album, More Specials was predominately crafted in the studio, as, in his pursuit of musical perfection, Dammers had become infatuated with the idea of a recording studio and the possibilities it presented for numerous overdubs and fine tuning. Consequently, More Specials is more producer-dominated than the band's previous work. In this period, Dammers would listen to any music with an open mind, feeling that no matter whether he initially thought the music was good or bad, he would grow to like it with repeated plays.

John Lewis of Uncut wrote that, compared to the \"teenage male fear writ large\" on the band's first album, More Specials \"presents a dread that\u2019s more existential than adolescent.\" Critic Vivien Goldman nonetheless commented that the band's bleak world view is presented with humour: \"This may be the funniest record of 1980.\"", "#\"Man at C & A\" (Jerry Dammers, Terry Hall) \u2013 3:36", "*Jerry Dammers \u2013 organ, piano, keyboards, production"]}, {"page": "Two-tone (music genre)", "response": ["Two-tone or 2 tone is a genre of British popular music of the late 1970s and early 1980s that fused traditional Jamaican ska music with elements of punk rock and new wave music.
