Rose brought up Des after their parents died. Des' girlfriend Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) sees Rose and Des alone and assumes they are having an affair. Des explains their relationship and Rose goes to the McQueens for tea and seems to enjoy herself. Rose is disturbed to learn Jacqui had a mixed-race sister, Tina Reilly (Leah Hackett), and it is revealed Rose and Des share racist views. Rose succeeds in her efforts to turn Des against Asian Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal). When Des is still slightly ambivalent, Rose threatens to disown him. She then helps him in his efforts to plant a smoke bomb inside Ravi's restaurant, Relish. She was again much more angry when Des proposed to Jacqui. To her relief, Jacqui declines his proposal when discovering about his racist attacks and this causes him to subsequently leave the village. Rose is not seen again."]}]}}
