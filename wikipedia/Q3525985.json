His bowling achieved considerable turn off the wicket, and was described in Wisden as having \"a deceptive curl\"[2]. Young's cricketing successes in minor matches led Essex to buy him out of the Royal Navy. He played a few games in 1898, but came to prominence early the following year, when he took eleven wickets for 74 runs against a powerful Australian touring side and gave Essex a surprising victory by 126 runs. The Times, describing his bowling in the second innings when he took seven for 32, said \"Young's bowling could not be played\", that he \"came off the pitch at a great pace\" and \"turned six inches with his arm\". He continued to bowl so well in a very dry summer of prolific run scoring that by July he was regarded by some as \"the best hard wicket bowler at England's disposal\".Sailor Young was picked for two Test matches that season and took six wickets in each of them, finishing at the top of the England averages. However, as a result of him losing form somewhat after bowling the Players to victory at The Oval, Sailor Young was discarded for the last match of the series and never played Test cricket again. He still took 139 wickets for the year, making him the sixth highest wicket-taker.\nYoung's success in 1899 led to great expectations for him, but after an excellent performance for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Yorkshire early in the year \"Sailor\" surprisingly fell off to such an extent that for Essex in county matches he took only forty-three wickets as against eighty-nine. After improving a little in 1901 and doing an impressive performance on a soft pitch against Kent early in 1902 \"Sailor\" nevertheless fell off completely. By 1903 his wicket tally was down to just 52 and after that season he dropped out of regular cricket because of severe rheumatism in his muscles. Sailor Young continued to play a few matches for Essex and as a member of the MCC ground staff right up to 1912, but could never undertake anything more than very short bowling spells. In 1910-11 he was a member of the MCC team that toured the West Indies.\nFrom 1921 to 1931, Young was a first-class umpire and he officiated in two Test matches in 1924 and 1926.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Essex County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Sailor Young"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Sailor Young||||3||1924||1926"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Sailor Young \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Sailor (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Sailor Young (1876\u20131964), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Harry Chidgey", "response": ["In 1925 and 1926, he was on the first-class umpires' list, and he was picked, alongside Sailor Young, for the fourth Test between England and Australia on the 1926 tour; the game, at Manchester, was ruined by rain with less than two full innings completed. He was picked as an umpire for first-class matches again in the 1927 season, but did not appear in any games."]}, {"page": "Bertram Beard", "response": ["He made two first-class appearances for Sussex in the 1899 County Championship against Essex and Lancashire, both at the County Ground, Hove.  Against Essex, Beard was dismissed for 4 runs in Sussex's first-innings by Sailor Young, while in their second-innings he wasn't required to bat, with the match ending in a draw.  Against Lancashire, Beard was dismissed for a duck in Sussex's first-innings by Willis Cuttell.  He didn't bat again in the match, as Sussex won by an innings and 2 runs."]}, {"page": "Home Counties cricket team", "response": ["A Home Counties cricket team was a cricket team formed of players who represented counties which were considered a part of England's home counties. The team first appeared in 1862 in a minor match against Southgate Cricket Club. The team later appeared once in first-class cricket in 1899 against The Rest at the Central Recreation Ground, Hastings. The team for their only first-class match consisted of Arthur Turner and Sailor Young of Essex; Alec Hearne and Bill Bradley of Kent; Francis Ford and Andrew Stoddart of Middlesex; Bobby Abel, Tom Hayward and Digby Jephson of Surrey and; Harry Butt and K. S. Ranjitsinhji of Sussex. With the exception of Jephson and Turner, all had played Test cricket for England. Their only appearance in first-class cricket ended as a draw. The team reappeared in the 1940s, playing two minor matches against Lancashire in 1946 and 1948."]}, {"page": "List of Essex County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Sailor Young (1898\u20131912) : H.
