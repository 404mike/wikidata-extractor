In producing the show, O'Grady worked with many old friends, including warm-up man Andy Collins. The series was a hit, attaining between 2.5 and 2.7\u00a0million viewers daily. According to O'Grady biographer Neil Simpson, the series was \"a riotous, endearingly kitsch romp with no pretensions to be anything other than pure entertainment. In some ways it was pure vaudeville[...] There were novelty acts, talking dogs, whistling goldfish, extraordinary stories. His audience laughed like drains at his anecdotes and were brought right into the heart of the show.\" The inclusion of his dog, Buster, on the show proved particularly popular with audiences. The show gained a devoted following, with many fans attending the screenings; often, as many as a hundred had to be turned away. Describing those attending the screenings, Simpson noted that \"Groups of middle aged women dominate\u2014but they are joined by beautiful twenty-something women with flawless make-up, flash City boys with Louis Vuitton briefcases, hip-looking students out for a good time and pensioners just wanting a laugh in the afternoon.\""]}, {"page": "BBC Three Counties Radio", "response": ["*Andy Collins (weekday breakfast)"]}, {"page": "Capital South Coast", "response": ["* Andy Collins"]}, {"page": "Stuart Miles", "response": ["He is also the regular stand in for Andy Collins on the breakfast show on BBC Three Counties Radio."]}, {"page": "Andy Collins", "response": ["Andy Collins may refer to:  ", "* Andy Collins (TV presenter) (born 1970), British television personality", "* Andy Collins (game designer), role-playing game developer and \"Sage\" for Wizards of the Coast", "* Andy Collins (artist) (born 1971), American artist"]}, {"page": "Games World", "response": ["Games World was a British entertainment programme that aired on Sky One originally from 1 March 1993 to 10 March 1995 with Bob Mills as host, and then revived from 9 March 1998 to 1999 with Andy Collins as host.", "A fourth series was scheduled to air in 1995/1996 but never materialized.
