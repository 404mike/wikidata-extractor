Gr\u00fcnschlo\u00df posits, \"because of the connections between several motifs in Hubbard's novels and specific Scientology teachings, one might perceive Scientology as one of the rare instances where science fiction (or fantasy literature generally) is related to the successful formation of a new spiritual movement.\" Comparing the fusion between the two genres of Hubbard's science fiction writing and Scientology creation myth, Gr\u00fcnschlo\u00df writes, \"Although the science fiction novels are of a different genre than other 'techno-logical' disclosures of Hubbard, they are highly appreciated by participants, and Hubbard's literary output in this realm (including the latest movie, Battlefield Earth) is also well promoted by the organization.\" Writing in the book UFO Religions edited by Christopher Partridge, Gr\u00fcnschlo\u00df observes, \"the enthusiasm for ufology and science fiction was cultivated in the formative phase of Scientology.

The religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge characterised P-Orridge's work as being a \"confluence of pornography, violence, death, degradation, the confrontation of taboo subjects, noise and Paganism\", deliberately courting controversy and expressing an anti-establishment stance. Partridge suggested that this intent to shock emerged both out of a serious attempt to highlight the mechanisms of social control in Western society and also out of \"a juvenile delight gained from extreme behaviour and the offence caused\".", "On a religious or spiritual level, Christopher Partridge described P-Orridge as representing \"a particularly interesting, influential and subversive example of contemporary paganism\". Asserting that their \"industrial paganism\" was different from most forms of contemporary paganism, Partridge described it as \"confrontational, subversive, experimental and, to a large extent, dystopian\", with it serving as \"an ideological tool\" with which to analyse society \"from its underbelly; an immersion in the dark side; the subversion of Christian hegemony, conservative politics and what nowadays might be described as neoliberalism\". P-Orridge was devoted to the deity Eshu Eleggu\u00e1, an entity from the Afro-Caribbean syncretic religion of Santer\u00eda. P-Orridge also stated disbelief in the literal existence of gods, deeming such entities to instead be \"early attempts at psychology, trying to understand the light and dark side of human nature\"."]}, {"page": "Religious studies", "response": ["Notwithstanding the long interest in the study of religion, the academic discipline Religious Studies is relatively new.
