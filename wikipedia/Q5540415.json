Hennessy was created a Baronet, of Windlesham in the County of Surrey, in 1927, and on 22 February 1937 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Windlesham, of Windlesham in Surrey.Windlesham was born in France, the son of Richard Hennessy and Marthe n\u00e9e Hennessy. His parents were first cousins, both from the Franco-Irish family of Cognac fame. His parents separated and his mother moved to England with her children. Marthe Hennessy eventually remarried in 1888 with James Sholto Douglas (1855\u20131891), youngest brother of the Marquess of Queensberry. Family ties with the French branches were maintained but economic interests in the cognac business were discontinued by family arrangement.
