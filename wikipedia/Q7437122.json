Stating that he wanted to \"bring players into the club that are not failures\", he signed, among others, former Stevenage captain Ronnie Henry, who had won two promotions in three years, striker Jon Shaw, who had scored 35 goals throughout the season, and midfielder Jonathan Smith, who had played 48 times the previous season for Swindon Town as they won promotion to League One and finished as runners-up in the Football League Trophy. After a solid start to the 2012\u201313 season, which saw Buckle's side keep pace with the leaders, Luton's league form soon collapsed with the club winning only three league games between November 2012 and February 2013. Buckle was in charge as Luton beat Premier League side Norwich City 1\u20130 away at Carrow Road on 26 January 2013 in the FA Cup Fourth Round, striker Scott Rendell's late goal ensuring that the club became the first non-League team in 24 years to defeat a top division side in the competition. However, just three weeks later he left the club by mutual consent for personal reasons. These were later revealed to be an imminent move abroad to the US with his wife, TV sports presenter Rebecca Lowe, who was fronting NBC's Premier League coverage in the country."]}, {"page": "Rendell", "response": ["*Scott Rendell (born 1986), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Chris Holroyd", "response": ["Ahead of the 2009\u201310 season, Holroyd was assigned the number nine shirt following the departure of fellow striker Scott Rendell. He started the club's first match of the season, playing the whole game in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Barrow. Three days later, he scored twice in Cambridge's 3\u20131 win against Ebbsfleet United, scoring both goals. Holroyd scored his first professional hat-trick four days later, scoring against his former employers, Chester City, as Cambridge came from two goals down to win the match 4\u20132. One of his goals included an audacious over head kick, 15 yards from goal. Holroyd scored four goals in two games shortly after, netting against Gateshead and Forest Green Rovers respectively. He scored a further two goals in Cambridge's 4\u20133 home loss to Luton Town in September 2009, taking his goal tally to eleven for the season. His twelfth goal of the season came against Cambridge's local rivals, Histon, Holroyd netting with just nine minutes remaining in a 1\u20131 draw. A week later, he scored from the penalty spot in Cambridge's 4\u20130 win against Ebbsfleet United. His fine goalscoring form continued into November 2009, scoring in victories against Kidderminster Harriers and Ilkeston Town respectively. After his goal against Ilkeston Town, Holroyd did not find the net until the end of December 2009, scoring just before half-time for Cambridge as they lost 2\u20131 at Mansfield Town. A week later, Cambridge United assistant manager, Paul Carden, said that he expected Holroyd to leave the club in the January transfer window. He subsequently played his last game for the club in Cambridge's 1\u20130 home defeat to Eastbourne Borough.

In this early period McLean had only one league goal to his name. However whilst Peterborough's luck changed for the better starting with a 5\u20134 win against Bristol Rovers in which McLean scored one of Peterborough's five goals, he suffered an elbow injury in the game and had to miss several of the following games. Following three substitute appearances, McLean was back in the starting line-up replacing Scott Rendell. McLean went on to start for the remainder of the season, which saw Peterborough secure second position in the league and with it promotion to the Championship. Despite suffering injury, McLean finished the season with a total of 18 league goals in 39 appearances and was Peterborough's highest scorer behind Craig Mackail-Smith."]}, {"page": "Luke Jones (footballer)", "response": ["After his successful loan spell earlier in the season, Jones joined Kidderminster on a permanent basis in May 2008, signing a one-year contract. He started in the club's first game of the 2008\u201309 season, a 1\u20131 home draw with newly promoted Lewes, and scored his first professional goal later that month, on 25 August, heading in a corner with just ten minutes remaining as Kidderminster twice came from behind to draw 2\u20132 with Burton Albion. He received the first red card of his career in October 2008, described as a \"stupid\" dismissal in Kidderminster's 5\u20131 away victory against King's Lynn in the FA Cup. Jones added another goal to his tally that season when he scored in the club's 3\u20132 win over Burscough in the FA Trophy on 16 December 2008. He was a regular fixture in the side's defence during the first half of the season as Kidderminster were fighting for one of the four play-off positions. However, after Kidderminster lost 3\u20131 to Cambridge United on 17 February 2009, a game in which Jones gave away a penalty after fouling Scott Rendell in the area, he did not feature again for two months. He returned to first-team action on 1 April, as Kidderminster comfortably secured a 5\u20131 away win against Woking, and went on to make four further appearances during the remainder of the season. Jones made 33 appearances and scored twice during a season that witnessed Kidderminster narrowly miss out on the play-off places, finishing in sixth, two points behind the final play-off position.
