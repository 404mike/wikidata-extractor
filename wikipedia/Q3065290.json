He is a senior scholar at Ridley Hall, Cambridge.\nIn 2006, Bauckham published Jesus and the Eyewitnesses, described by several other scholars (e.g. Ben Witherington III, Samuel Byrskog, Judith CS Redman, etc.) as a paradigm shift in Gospels study. In this book, Bauckham argues that the Synoptic Gospels are based \"quite closely\" on the testimony of eyewitnesses, while the Gospel of John is written by an eyewitness, against the current scholarly consensus that the four reflect the theology of communities in which they arose and are the products of long development. Bauckham updated and expanded the book to respond to critics in a second edition, published in 2017. Additionally, his work, The Theology of the Book of Revelation, is considered one of the best introductions to Revelation available. Bauckham also contributed the commentary on Revelation to the Oxford Bible Commentary (2001) edited by Barton and Muddiman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Book of Revelation", "response": ["Some commentators argue that it is these purposes \u2013 and not the structure \u2013 that really matter.

Jesus: Neither God Nor Man \u2013 The Case for a Mythical Jesus. Ottawa: Age of Reason Publications. p. 716, n. 12.  Therefore, Doherty concludes that Christianity started with the myth of this incarnated Christ, who was subsequently historicised. According to Doherty, the nucleus of this historicised Jesus of the Gospels can be found in the Jesus-movement that wrote the Q source.

Licona, Ravi Zacharias and John Lennox.", "Biblical apologetics include issues concerned with the authorship and date of biblical books, biblical canon, and biblical inerrancy. Christian apologists defend and comment on various books of the Bible. Some scholars who have engaged in the defense of biblical inerrancy include Robert Dick Wilson, Gleason Archer, Norman Geisler and R. C. Sproul. There are several resources that Christians offer defending inerrancy in regard to specific verses. Authors defending the reliability of the Gospels include Craig Blomberg in The Historical Reliability of the Gospels,  Mark D. Roberts in Can We Trust the Gospels? Richard Bauckham, Craig Evans and Darrell Bock."]}]}}
