He embarked on a political career, and was a Member of Parliament for the Parliaments of Ireland and Great Britain.\nStewart was born into the nobility, raised the younger son of a viscount. He entered the navy at an early age, but suffered a severe wound at the beginning of his career, losing his right hand. He recovered, and prospered in the service, rising to command several ships in the frequent wars of the early eighteenth century. He also had an interest in politics, representing Tyrone from 1715. By 1720 he had risen high enough in the navy to be entrusted with a squadron to take action against Mediterranean piracy, particularly the dangerous Sal\u00e9 Rovers. He had the dual commission of acting as minister plenipotentiary to Morocco, and managed to successfully negotiate a treaty and the release of 296 British prisoners.\nRewarded with an increased pension and further commands, Stewart was raised to flag rank and served for a time as commander in chief in the West Indies, and held junior commands in the Channel Fleet. He also sat for the British parliament, representing Malmesbury from 1723 until 1727, and Portsmouth from 1737 until his death in 1741.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Jenkins (master mariner)", "response": ["The confrontational nature of British politics in 1738 led many who were opposed to launching a naval war against Spain to doubt the truthfulness of Jenkins' story.
