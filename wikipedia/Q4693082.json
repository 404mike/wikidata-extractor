She wrote four books:  The Book of Ices (1885), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery (1888), Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes (1891) and Fancy Ices (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking.

The rapidity of chilling also leads to the formation of smaller ice crystals, which provides the dessert with a smoother texture. The technique is employed by chef Heston Blumenthal who has used it at his restaurant, The Fat Duck, to create frozen dishes such as egg and bacon ice cream. Liquid nitrogen has also become popular in the preparation of cocktails because it can be used to quickly chill glasses or freeze ingredients. It is also added to drinks to create a smoky effect, which occurs as tiny droplets of the liquid nitrogen come into contact with the surrounding air, condensing the vapour that is naturally present."]}, {"page": "Ice cream maker", "response": ["Dubbed the \"Queen of Ices\", Victorian English culinary entrepreneur Agnes Marshall was granted a patent for an ice cream machine that could freeze a pint of ice cream in five whole minutes.

A 'white' version that uses Windsor beans was published in 1855. Some were made from mutton, beef and rice. Agnes Marshall had a simple barley and meat version, and French chef Auguste Escoffier created a creamy Windsor soup at the Savoy Hotel restaurant in the 1890s, a favourite eatery for English royalty including the Prince of Wales."]}, {"page": "Penny lick", "response": ["*Agnes Marshall"]}, {"page": "Carlo Gatti", "response": ["* Agnes Marshall, queen of ice cream"]}, {"page": "Agnes Smith", "response": ["*Agnes Marshall (1855\u20131905), n\u00e9e Smith, English culinary entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "Agnes Bertha Marshall", "response": ["#redirectAgnes Marshall"]}, {"page": "Agnes B.
