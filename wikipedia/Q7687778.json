This book series, begun in 2004, emphasises the importance of understanding the series in the context of British politics, culture and science. Volume Six was, barring a guest-piece by Robert Shearman and input from Lars Pearson, almost entirely Wood's work. Volumes Seven, Eight and Nine were co-written with Dorothy Ail after Miles left the project. Wood and Ail updated the e-book editions of volumes Five and Six. The updated Volume Three, substantially expanded solely by Wood but retaining a few pieces of Miles's work, was published in 2008 and longlisted for the BSFA Award for non-fiction. A revised Volume Four is due in 2020.In addition to this series, Wood has contributed to non-fiction works for other publishers, including Relative Dissertations in Time and Space (Manchester University press 2006). The Cult TV Book (IB Tauris 2010). TARDIS Outside In volume 2 (ATB Books 2013) and Outside In Boldly Goes (2015). In November 2014 he gave a talk for the 'ON TV' symposium held in Sheffield by University of Northampton. He and Ail wrote World History in Minutes for Quercus Books in 2015.\nWood has also written for Doctor Who Magazine, Starburst, TV Zone, Film Review and Xpose on subjects as diverse as crop circles, art fraud, the problems of adapting children's novels for television and the Piltdown hoax. In a 1993 edition of \"Dreamwatch\", he wrote a piece entitled \"Hai! Anxiety\", in which the Jon Pertwee era of the series was \u2013 unusually for the time \u2013 held up to sustained criticism. \nHe is also active in Doctor Who fandom, notably as editor of the fanzines Spectrox, Yak Butter Sandwich and Spaceball Ricochet. Some of his fan writing was included in the anthology Licence Denied, published in 1997.After a year working in France he is now resident in the U.S.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coal Hill School", "response": ["Writer Kim Newman interprets Coal Hill School as a secondary modern school, which he notes is unusual for British children's television in the early 1960s; educational settings in children's television of the time were more commonly \"fantasy fee-paying schools\" like Billy Bunter's Greyfriars School. However, Tat Wood and Lawrence Miles interpret the lack of uniforms at Coal Hill as an indication that it is an early comprehensive school.", "Tat Wood notes that in this story, which most viewers interpret as being set shortly after the events of \"An Unearthly Child\", Coal Hill School has a school uniform. From this and other evidence in Remembrance of the Daleks, such as the fact that it is broad daylight at 5:15 pm, Wood hypothesizes that Remembrance is actually set in the summer of 1963, prior to the events of \"An Unearthly Child\", with the school's uniforms being phased out in the autumn term."]}, {"page": "Time and the Rani", "response": ["Reviewing Time and the Rani, Tat Wood criticised the story's dialogue and plot, but praised the direction as \"visually impressive\".

They also argue that, contrary to the tendency to treat the story as a one-episode introduction to the series followed by \"three episodes of running around and escaping\" that the piece should be considered as a single, dramatic whole that is \"about making four people who barely know one another learn to trust each other\"."]}, {"page": "Enlightenment (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The episode makes use of a regular science-fiction trope: bored, god-like beings playing with mortals' lives for amusement.  In their book About Time, Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood liken this to a prevalent strand of children's fiction, where magical worlds are held together by the rules of the children who visit them.  Miles and Wood also highlight the political elements of the story, likening the portrayal of the Eternals to the view of the upper classes as \"effete parasites feeding off the labour (and in this case the imagination) of the proles.\"  The Doctor then acts as part of the class struggle, helping the workers gain freedom while the gentry get their comeuppance.", "In their book About Time, Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood have equally mixed feelings about the serial, praising the setting and the performances of Barron and Brown, and suggesting that it \"...carries on the tradition of putting symbols from the world we know into disconcerting environments... ...(it) completes the grand illusion of making the history and the fantasy feel like part of the same continuum.\"  They are less complimentary about other elements however, citing the conclusion as feeling \"rushed and tacked on\" with too much emphasis on the Guardians and little on the fates of the Eternals. They also dismiss the reveal of enlightenment as being the nature of Turlough's choice, as coming \"perilously close to tweeness\" and accuse it of being \"cod-mythologic moralising\"."]}, {"page": "Lawrence Miles", "response": ["Lawrence Miles (born 15 March 1972 in Middlesex) is a science fiction author known for his work on original Doctor Who novels (for both the Virgin New Adventures and BBC Books series) and the subsequent spin-off Faction Paradox. He is also co-author (with Tat Wood) of the About Time series of Doctor Who critiques.", "Miles is the co-author of the first five volumes of About Time, a Doctor Who episode guide which examines the series in its cultural and historical context. Co-written with Tat Wood, the guide contains detailed accounts of the various concerns that fed into the making of the series and a number of essays answering specific questions (e.g. \"How might the sonic screwdriver work?\" and \"Why didn't they just spend more money?\"). In contrast to other Doctor Who guides, About Time is divided by \"era\" rather than by the lead actor, broadly reflecting different production philosophies and cultural climates. The several volumes are published in order of popularity rather than chronologically; volumes three and four were published first, covering the early and late 1970s. There are six volumes in total, the last covering the late eighties, the 1996 television movie and everything up to, but not including, the new 2005 series. Miles chose to leave the project after the completion of volume two, and the sixth and final volume was written by Wood.

This is apparently due to a (fictional) principle known as the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, and was seen when the past and future versions of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart touched hands in Mawdryn Undead. The Doctor's incarnations do not appear to suffer this effect when encountering each other and shaking hands. This has never been explained. An essay in the About Time episode guides by Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood suggests that Time Lords are somehow exempt from the effect by their very nature. Rose Tyler is seen holding an infant version of herself in \"Father's Day\", with no visible energy discharge, but the contact does allow the Reapers to enter the church in which the Doctor and several others are taking refuge. While doing a live commentary on the episode at the 2006 Bristol Comic Expo, episode author Paul Cornell said that this is supposed to be due to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect, even though it is not mentioned by name. He suggested that the lack of a spark may be down to the fact that the Time Lords were no longer around to manage anomalies."]}, {"page": "Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle", "response": ["Andrew Blair of website Den of Geek calls the SPV \"clearly the best vehicle in the show\". Comparing it to \"a tank driven at ludicrous speeds, while facing backwards and located in secret garages around the world\", he argues that the vehicle represents \"probably the fastest transformation from covert to ridiculously unsubtle that fiction has ever seen.\" James Taylor of Car magazine ranks the SPV one of the top 10 vehicles from the Gerry Anderson productions. On the vehicle's design, he comments that \"all-round visibility [was] clearly not a priority of Captain Scarlet's employers.\" Writing for TV Zone magazine, Tat Wood questions Spectrum's logic in keeping its SPVs hidden until they are needed (\"inside caravans, gasometers, tubes of Pringles or wherever\") given that they are \"then abandoned on the road\"."]}, {"page": "The Twin Dilemma", "response": ["Where the previous serial, The Caves of Androzani, is frequently cast among the very best of all Doctor Who stories, the fandom often holds this serial the polar opposite, commonly regarding it as one of the very worst serials in the history of the series. The review of the story in Doctor Who: The Television Companion describes The Twin Dilemma as \"painful to watch\", describing the Doctor's erratic behaviour as \"forced and artificial, and succeed[s] only in alienating the viewer.\" The review also argues the script \"leaves much to be desired\" and that the direction is uninteresting, giving the whole story \"a rather tacky, B-movie feel to it\".  In SFX #150 new series producer Russell T Davies cites this story as \"the beginning of the end\" of Doctor Who. Tat Wood and Lawrence Miles, reviewing the story in the book About Time, noted that the divide in quality between The Caves of Androzani and The Twin Dilemma \"felt wrong at the time, and still feels wrong now\". They also asked \"How could anyone have thought that this story, of juvenile space monsters, meaningless plans and never-ending cop-outs, was ever workable?\".  In his review for Radio Times, Patrick Mulkern gave the serial a negative reception, stating: \"If The Twin Dilemma is individually a disaster, it also establishes the opening titles, the Doctor\u2019s clothes, his behaviour and sniping banter with Peri \u2013 all part of an unpleasant shift in tone that would permeate and eventually poleaxe the era. How did Nathan-Turner and Saward think that this approach might be in any way acceptable?\" A 1998 poll by Doctor Who Magazine ranked the serial the second worst of all time (the Children in Need special Dimensions in Time was ranked lowest), while a 2003 poll by fansite Outpost Gallifrey ranked it worst of all, below even Dimensions in Time. In 2009, another Doctor Who Magazine poll of the 200 stories produced up to that point saw the serial finish in last place again, along with finishing last in every single age group that voted (although Dimensions in Time technically scored lower, it was no longer included in the main poll due to its lack of canonicity within the series and was instead placed in a spin-off section). A similar poll in 2014 placed the story in last place once again.Doctor Who Magazine Issue 474"]}, {"page": "Tat", "response": ["*Tat Wood, a British author"]}, {"page": "Vengeance on Varos", "response": ["Reviewing the story in About Time, Tat Wood described it as \"like channel-zapping between a radical fringe theatre and children's television\". He praised Martin's script and the story's production design, stating the story \"gets more marks for effort than anything else this year\". Wood also suggested that if someone wanted to understand what it was like to be living in Thatcher's Britain, they should watch Vengeance on Varos, then to \"imagine a world where this could be followed by Jim'll Fix It\". In Doctor Who: The Complete Guide, Mark Campbell awarded Vengeance on Varos six out of ten, describing it as \"a brave idea, hindered by a plodding narrative and wooden performances\". He also thought the \"notorious acid bath scene\" was \"deeply problematic\". Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded it four stars out of five, describing Nabil Shaban's Sil as \"one of the most effective new Doctor Who monsters in ages\". He found that Jason Connery was \"struggling through cumbersome dialogue\" but felt there were \"several weaker performances on display\", though he praised Martin Jarvis as \"graceful and suitably subdued\". He was also critical of the acid bath scene, considering it \"unfunny, unDoctorly and should have been changed at script stage\".

Guest star Paul Darrow described Timelash as \"the most disliked and also one of the most liked, which is fascinating\". Graham Sleight noted that Timelash is \"widely regarded as one of the worst series ever broadcast as part of Doctor Who\", claiming the story has \"a weak script, cheap-looking design, unimaginative direction, laughable special effects and some appalling performances\". However, Sleight also praises Robert Ashby's performance as the Borad, claiming Ashby's performance \"elevates his menace to an entirely different level to the rest of the story\". Tat Wood described it as \"a grindingly dull story only memorable for being made as a school panto with belated New Romantic 80s fashion errors\". Wood singled out the story's script, production and costumes for particular criticism. Wood also pointed out the H.G. Wells depicted in Timelash is different from the real-life Wells (the Wells depicted in Timelash is not blond, lacks a Cockney/Kentish accent, and is interested in spiritualism)."]}, {"page": "The Greatest Show in the Galaxy", "response": ["Reviewing The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Tat Wood described it as \"a story with so much going right\"  and a sign of how he believed the show had improved since its mid-1980s period.

It also appears, given the number of times that the Doctor has met his other incarnations, that the effect does not apply to Time Lords or, at the very least, can be mitigated.
