Despite his lack of height, Bowden impressed the Saints' fans with his \"stylish neatness when in possession\". Bowden missed two months mid-season following an injury (when he was replaced by John Robertson) before returning at the end of January for the rest of the season. He played the last four matches at left-half, with Frank Thorpe taking over at centre-half, following an injury to Bill Gray."]}, {"page": "Frank Thorpe", "response": ["Thorpe spent the 1906\u201307 season with Plymouth Argyle of the Southern League, before moving along the south coast in April 1907 to join fellow Southern league team, Southampton. Thorpe made his debut in a 4\u20132 victory at Northampton Town on 6 April 1907, taking over at centre-half from James Bowden, who was moved to fill the left-half position, which had been not been filled satisfactorily since Bill Gray had been injured in March."]}, {"page": "John Patten (footballer)", "response": ["Patten had played for Shrewsbury before coming to Southampton for a trial in March 1907. He had originally expected to play a reserve-team match at Ryde but, because of an injury crisis which had sidelined Jack Hogg, Alex Glen and Bill Gray, he was included in the first-team for the Southern League match against Watford on 30 March 1907, which ended 0\u20130. The local press commented that \"his policy of parting before an  opponent can get to him is to be commended\". He retained his place for the next two matches, scoring in a 3\u20132 defeat against West Ham United and a 4\u20132 victory at Northampton Town. He then lost his place to Edward Bell for two matches before being recalled for the final match of the season."]}]}}
