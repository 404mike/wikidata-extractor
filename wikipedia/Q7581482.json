Amongst many racing successes, Rowsell won the Merlin Rocket Class Championships at Abersoch Wales in 1978, crewed by Jon Turner, with a series of results which have not been surpassed by any later Champion of the Class. Rowsell was in partnership with Phil Morrison as Rowsell Morrison for about 15 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Exmouth", "response": ["*Spud Rowsell (born 1944), sailor"]}, {"page": "Phil Morrison (yacht designer)", "response": ["Morrison grew up in Eastbourne, during the late fifties and sixties. Joining the nearby Pevensey Bay Sailing Club he learnt to sail the National 12 Class racing dinghy. The National 12 is a development class where anyone can design and build new boats within specific restrictions, such as length, beam, weight and sail area. At the age of 18 he designed his first racing dinghy, a National 12 called \"China Doll\" (1967) which was built by Spud Rowsell in Exmouth, commencing a long association between the designer and that Devon town. Morrison sailed China Doll with Pete Wargent very successfully and the design became popular, making his name as a young designer, a series of different and successful National 12 designs followed over the next 25 years such as \"Whisper\" \"Paper Dart\" \"Windfall\" \"Marmite Soldier\" and \"Crusader\".", "Bigger projects beckoned after Morrison moved his sailing making and design business to Exmouth in a new partnership with Spud Rowsell in the mid 1980s, the builder of his original design China Doll 17 years before. \"Exmouth Challenge\" a 53\u00a0ft offshore trimaran designed and built for Mark Gatehouse was Morrison's first multihull. Morrison says:", "A precursor to his later interest in and wide influence on One Design Classes was his innovative original and very successful NSM design for the Merlin Rocket class which included the entire rig and fittings layout so that sailor's buying the design could be told exactly how to set up the boats in different conditions for best performance. This included an easily adjustable mast strut, a high mainsheet hoop and Morrison Wires providing pre-bend and lateral stiffness to the mast. Spud Rowsell and Jon Turner won the Merlin Rocket Championships in \"Foot-Loose\" at Abersoch in 1978 with a points performance that has never been bettered and guaranteed the future success of Morrison's approach to designing a complete boat."]}, {"page": "\"Spud\" (Peter) Rowsell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Spud Rowsell"]}, {"page": "Rowsell", "response": ["* Spud Rowsell (21st century), English sailboat racer"]}, {"page": "Peter Rowsell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Spud Rowsell"]}]}}
