Dahiru, along with his cousin Muhammadu Girei (later known as Sardauna) and Mallu Hamman (later known as Waziri Mallu Hamman) were the first natives of Adamawa to undergo Western education when they were sent by the provincial administration in 1911 to attend the new school run by Hanns Vischer (Dan Hausa) in Kano. Upon his return from Kano, Dahiru became the first Native Treasurer in the then Yola Province. Later in 1919, he was appointed by Lamido Muhammad Abba as the fourth Galadima of Adamawa, a title that has now remained with the descendants of Modibbo Raji for over 100 years.Abubakar, Sa'ad (2008).
