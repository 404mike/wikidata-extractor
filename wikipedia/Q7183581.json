He was born at Rode, Somerset.\nA member of the Fussell family which had farming, and brewing interests in and around the village of Rode, Philip Fussell was all-round sportsman who, in addition to cricket, was prominent also in shooting, where he was a champion at clay pigeon shooting, and salmon fishing. He is named in an article published in The Field in 2009 on the 100 \"best shots\" of all time. It said: \"Clay and game are one and the same for this experienced and beautifully consistent shot, though pigeon is his speciality.\" In The Field his first name is spelled as \"Phillip\".\nAs a cricketer, Fussell played for Lansdown and Frome cricket clubs as a right-handed batsman and right-arm medium-paced bowler. He did not make much impact in his two first-class matches, totalling just 10 runs in all and taking just a single wicket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Philip Fussell (1953\u20131956) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Fussell", "response": ["* Philip Fussell (born 1931), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Phillip Fussell", "response": ["#redirect Philip Fussell"]}]}}
