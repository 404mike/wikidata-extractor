However, subsequent critics have not concurred in this assessment, most notably the investigations of Knutowski, R.B. McKerrow, and Tucker Brooke found very little that they felt could be credited to Nashe. While Frederick S. Boas admitted a few details had parallels in Nashe's published works and some words or meanings are found in Nashe's works but not otherwise used by Marlowe, \"the scenes in which these passages and phrases appear have, as a whole, the stamp of Marlowe.\"Boas, Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940), p.51 Some critics have virtually ignored the participation of Nashe \u2014 yet the presence of a collaborator may help to explain the play's divergences from Marlowe's standard dramaturgy. No other play by Marlowe has such a strong female lead character, and in no other \"is heteroerotic passion the centripetal force of the drama's momentum.\"Sara Munson Deats, in Cheney, p. 194. However, more recent studies conducted independently by Darren Freebury-Jones and Marcus Dahl, and Ruth Lunney and Hugh Craig, have failed to uncover evidence for Nashe's participation."]}, {"page": "Fleay", "response": ["* Frederick Gard Fleay (1831\u20131909), English Shakespeare scholar"]}]}}
