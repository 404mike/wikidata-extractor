Only 125 overs were possible in the match, and Scothern did not get to bat. With the ball he took his solitary first-class wicket when he had Cambridge captain Rob Andrew (who was to gain much greater fame in rugby union) lbw for 2.\nScothern was not retained at the end of 1985, and spent the rest of his career playing minor counties cricket for Cumberland. During this time he made several List A appearances, six for the county in the NatWest Trophy and one for the representative Minor Counties side in the Benson & Hedges Cup. His best performance came for Cumberland against Middlesex in the first round of the 1996 NatWest Trophy, when he claimed 3-29 from 11 overs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Cumberland County Cricket Club List A players", "response": ["* Michael Scothern, 6 matches, 1988\u20131997"]}, {"page": "Scothern, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Scothern"]}]}}
