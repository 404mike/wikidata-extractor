Gilda O'Neill writes in Lost Voices, an oral history of East End hop-pickers: \"I began to worry. Were the women's, and my, memories true or were they just stories? I realised that I had no 'innocent' sources of evidence - facts. I had, instead, the stories and their tellers' reasons for remembering in their own particular ways.'  Duncan Barrett, one of the co-authors of The Sugar Girls describes some of the perils of relying on oral history accounts: \"On two occasions, it became clear that a subject was trying to mislead us about what happened \u2013 telling a self-deprecating story in one interview, and then presenting a different, and more flattering, version of events when we tried to follow it up. ... often our interviewees were keen to persuade us of a certain interpretation of the past, supporting broad, sweeping comments about historical change with specific stories from their lives.\" Alessandro Portelli argues that oral history is valuable nevertheless: \"it tells us less about events as such than about their meaning [...] the unique and precious element which oral sources force upon the historian ... is the speaker's subjectivity.\""]}, {"page": "Dominion War", "response": ["The resurgence in the conflict provided opportunities to introduce problems such as post-conflict psychological trauma in \"The Siege of AR-558\" and injury when the character of Nog undergoes leg amputation in \"It's Only a Paper Moon\".

Lincoln Geraghty praises the ending to the story arc and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as a series, and believes this is indicative of how the series manipulates the Star Trek ethos, identifying a theme of ambiguity as part of its continuing narrative. Karin Blair, writing in 1997 at the time of Season Five, felt that the series was reflecting trends for American culture to re-consider its place in the global community.

When Apollo suggests that humans need a new pantheon of gods, Kirk dismisses the idea with the words, \"We find the one quite sufficient.\" In comparison, religious scholar Ross Kraemer says that Roddenberry \"pulled his punches\" regarding religion and in the television show religion was not absent but highly private.Kraemer et al, 9.
