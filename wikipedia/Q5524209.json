The 25-year-old Gillingham captain suffered a broken arm after taking a kick on the forearm in a 1\u20131 draw with Leyton Orient on 23 February 2010. A specialist subsequently confirmed that this injury would sideline him for approximately six weeks. By the time of his return the Gills were embroiled in a battle to avoid relegation and their fortunes took a turn for the worse when Fuller suffered a broken nose mere seconds after kick-off after a clash of heads with teammate Darren Dennehy in what would go on to be a 3\u20132 win over Leeds United on 17 April 2010; he was substituted by Jack Payne in the fourth minute of play. Fuller was unable to prevent the Gills' relegation slide back into League Two after he was sidelined for the rest of the season, undergoing surgery on his broken nose a few days after the incident. In spite of this, however, he was offered a two-year contract extension, along with teammate Garry Richards, by new Gills manager Andy Hessenthaler on 25 March 2010. He accepted the terms and on 4 June 2010 it was announced that he had signed a new contract along with striker Dennis Oli."]}, {"page": "Jo Kuffour", "response": ["After a successful loan spell in which he scored seven goals for the Gills, including a hat-trick in the 4\u20133 win over Northampton Town and both goals as league leaders Crawley Town were beaten 2\u20131 on Boxing Day, Kuffour signed for Gillingham permanently until the end of the season.

However, the club's league form soon nosedived and they went on to win only three league games over the course of the next four months. Victories over higher-league opponents Wolverhampton Wanderers and Norwich City in the FA Cup gave some respite, but \"genuine personal reasons\" saw Paul Buckle leave the club in February.
