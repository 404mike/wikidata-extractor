In October 1836, Landon met George Maclean, governor of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), at a dinner party given by Matthew Forster, and the two began a relationship. Maclean, however, moved to Scotland early the following year, to the surprise and distress of Landon and her friends. After much prodding, Maclean returned to England and he and Landon were married shortly thereafter, on 7 June 1838.

She had a considerable number of literary and social acquaintances including Augusta Leigh and Lady Cork.  During her own lifetime she was sometimes confused with Emma Roberts, with whom she corresponded, though the two women were not related.  They were about the same age and they were both referred to as Miss Roberts.  Unusually for single women of that era they had also both travelled separately to Calcutta within two or three years of each other.Two Years at Sea (1834)"]}, {"page": "Maria Rundell", "response": ["Subsequent editions were expanded, with some small errors corrected.

Elwood knew several of the women and she was given access to their documents. The book was well regarded and was used as a source for the Dictionary of National Biography.
