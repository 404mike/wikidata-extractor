Following Des Lyttle's departure as Tamworth manager in April 2011, Belford was appointed caretaker manager for the four remaining league games. His first game in charge was away at play-off chasing York City in which he won 2\u20131. His second game in charge ended in 1\u20130 defeat at home to fellow league strugglers Southport. The game ended with three Tamworth players receiving red cards (Liam Mitchell, Richard Tait and Michael Wylde). Belford's next game in charge was an away fixture at promotion chasing Wrexham. Due to the suspensions from the previous match Belford named himself as a substitute. Tamworth goalkeeper Louis Connor got injured in stoppage time and saw Belford donning the goalkeeper jersey once again for the last few minutes of the game. Belford is now the only player to play for Tamworth in four decades (1980's, 1990's, 2000's and 2010s). Belford's fourth and final game in charge saw him take on Forest Green Rovers in a must win game. In a very edgy 90 minutes, Tamworth did win the match 2\u20131 thus meaning Belford had kept the club in the Conference National at the expense of Southport who eventually stayed up due to Rushden & Diamonds entering liquidation."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["|Liam Mitchell"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["|12||Liam Mitchell||||Nottingham||18 September 1992||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||N/A||1 July 2011||Trainee"]}, {"page": "Liam Mitchell", "response": ["Liam Mitchell may refer to:", "* Liam Mitchell (footballer)", "* Liam Mitchell (rugby union)"]}]}}
