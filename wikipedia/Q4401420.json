From 1963 to 1966, he worked extensively with the group and did the photography and design on five of their album sleeves released consecutively on the Parlophone label in the UK, as well as on several albums on Capitol Records in the US and on various labels in other countries. Freeman designed the end credit sequences for their first two films and some of the graphics and photography displayed on the films' posters and promotional materials.\nHe worked as a film director on the rarely-seen Swinging London cult film The Touchables in 1968, which starred Judy Huxtable and David Anthony, and featured music by the British band Nirvana. He co-directed the 1969 film Secret World (La Promesse) with Paul Feyder.Freeman first came to prominence as a photo journalist working for the British newspaper The Sunday Times, for which he photographed a variety of subjects, including Nikita Khrushchev in the Kremlin. He had also become noted for his black-and-white photographs of several jazz musicians including John Coltrane. It was these photographs which impressed the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein and the Beatles themselves and led to his first commission in August 1963 to photograph the group. He was selected to photograph the entirety of the first ever Pirelli Calendar, shot in 1963 for the year 1964.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Song Remains the Same (film)", "response": ["* Robert Freeman\u00a0\u2013 camera operator"]}, {"page": "With the Beatles", "response": ["With the Beatles is the second studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 22 November 1963 on Parlophone,  eight months after the band's debut Please Please Me. Produced by George Martin, the album features eight original compositions (seven by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Don't Bother Me\", George Harrison's first recorded solo composition and his first released on a Beatles album) and six covers (mostly of rock and roll and Motown R&B hits). The cover photograph was taken by the fashion photographer Robert Freeman and has since been mimicked by several music groups over the years. A different cover was used for the Australian release of the album, which the Beatles were displeased with.", "Impressed with Robert Freeman's black-and-white pictures of John Coltrane, Brian Epstein invited the photographer to create the cover image. George Harrison later said that, whereas the cover of Please Please Me had been \"crap\", their second LP was \"the beginning of us being actively involved in The Beatles' artwork ... the first one where we thought, 'Hey, let's get artistic.'\" The group asked Freeman to take inspiration from pictures their friend Astrid Kirchherr had taken in Hamburg between 1960 and 1962, featuring the band members in half-shadow and not smiling. To achieve this result, on 22 August 1963, Freeman photographed them in a dark corridor of the Palace Court Hotel in Bournemouth, where the band were playing a summer residency at the local Gaumont Cinema. To fit the square format of the cover, he put Ringo Starr in the bottom right corner, \"since he was the last to join the group. He was also the shortest\". Paul McCartney described the result as \"very moody\", adding: \"people think he must have worked at [it] forever and ever. But it was an hour. He sat down, took a couple of rolls, and he had it.\" The original concept was to paint the picture from edge to edge, with no bleeding, title or artist credit \u2013 a concept that went against music industry practice and was immediately vetoed by EMI. The first album to carry an edge-to-edge cover was the Rolling Stones' self-titled debut, released five months later. EMI also objected to the fact that the Beatles were not smiling; it was only after George Martin intervened, as head of Parlophone, that the cover portrait was approved.

In his line drawings of the four Beatles, Voormann drew inspiration from the work of the nineteenth-century illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, who was the subject of a long-running exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 1966 and highly influential on fashion and design themes of the time. Voormann placed the various photos within the tangle of hair that connects the four faces.

Doggett recognises the cover photos for With the Beatles and Rubber Soul as examples of the band's image being used to \"test the limits of the portrait\", a movement that was also reflected in the cover designs for contemporary albums by Dylan and the Rolling Stones. Robert Freeman's monochrome cover shot for With the Beatles (or Capitol's Meet the Beatles! in the US) departed from convention, and alarmed EMI, by showing the band members looking austere and unsmiling. This stance was heightened in Freeman's cover portrait for Beatles for Sale, which departed further from the standard pop LP by reducing the album title to minuscule type and otherwise making no mention of the band's name. According to Schaffner, each Beatles LP cover represented a \"revolution in artwork\" starting with Rubber Soul.

He argues that the band's invitation into the British establishment \u2013 such as their interactions with photographer Robert Freeman, director Dick Lester and publisher Tom Maschler, among others \u2013 was unique for pop musicians of the time and threatened to erode elements of the British class system. Prince Philip of the British royal family read the book and said he enjoyed it thoroughly, while Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau described Lennon in 1969 as \"a pretty good poet\"., quoted in . The book resulted in numerous businesses and charities requesting that Lennon produce illustrations.

After returning to England, he served two years with the Royal Air Force for his National Service (Conscription) as an aerial photographer. During this period he became friends with a fellow conscriptee who was a member of a Liverpool \"Mersey Beat\" group, and he was introduced for the first time to this type of music. He was invited back to Liverpool to see a new group \u2013 The Beatles \u2013 who were appearing at the Cavern Club and was introduced to them there. From that point, he was hooked on \"Beat\" music from which The Beatles took their name. After his military service, Ferris emigrated to Vancouver, Canada working as an assistant there to master photographer Harry Nygard. From Nygard, Karl learned the skills of composition, form and texture. He also began an involvement in the \"Beatnik\" lifestyle and began hanging out in coffee bars, listening to poetry readings and the progressive jazz of such artists as Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy and Ornette Coleman. He photographed his first music subjects at these gatherings for local newspapers and magazines. He also began to take fashion shots of girlfriends and models, building up a respectable portfolio. Nygard told him that he had a real talent in this area, but to further expand his portfolio, he should return to London where the \"Mod\" fashion scene was creating new opportunities in the world of arts, music and fashion. In 1964 Karl returned to England and the \"Happening\" Beat scene.  Ferris received commissioned work as a fashion and cover photographer for teen magazines 19, Honey, Petticoat, She and later for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Burda, French Mode and Marie Claire. These commissions brought him to such locations as Paris, Cannes, Munich, Ibiza and Morocco. When he wasn't working he would join into the \"Scene\", and after meeting (and eventually dating) Denmark's top \"Superstar\" model of the time (Maude Bertelsen), Karl was introduced to a Pop group called \"The King Bees\" who invited him to sing cover versions of Rolling Stones songs with them, and so he began touring in and around Copenhagen with this group. He eventually returned to England for a \"fashion shoot\" offer with Vogue. In 1966, The Beatles had just released \"Rubber Soul\" and Karl had the chance to meet up with their official photographer, Robert Freeman, who encouraged Ferris to experiment with different styles of images \u2013 which he promptly did \u2013 and created his unique psychedelic style. That summer on a trip to the Spanish island of Ibiza he discovered and began shooting the innovative psychedelic fashion work of designers Simon Posthuma and Marijke Koger \u2013 aka The Fool \u2013 and these photos were eventually printed in the fashion section of The Sunday Times. This was the first time such psychedelic photography and fashions had been seen anywhere. He and The Fool were then invited to come to London to shoot some more \"Psychedelic\" fashion features for other magazines, working from a shared studio in a former private dance theatre. There, they created \"Art Happenings\" with self played psychedelic music with Fashion shows, Freeform Dancing and Action painting, with Liquid Light and Photo slide projections superimposed on the performers by Karl Ferris who also shot music and fashion photos  there.

Also, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton, The Cream, Donovan, T Rex, Mick Jagger, Grahman Nash, Graham Bond and artists Nigel Weymouth, Hapshas and the Coloured Coat, Peter Max and  David Hockney dropped by.
