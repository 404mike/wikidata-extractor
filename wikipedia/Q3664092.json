In 1919, MI5's budget was slashed from \u00a3100,000 and over 800 officers to just \u00a335,000 and 12 officers.  At the same time, Sir Basil Thomson of Special Branch was appointed Director of Home Intelligence, in supreme command of all domestic counter-insurgency and counter-intelligence investigations.  Consequently, as official MI5 historian Christopher Andrew has noted in his official history Defence of the Realm (2010), MI5 had no clearly defined role in the Anglo-Irish War.  To further worsen the situation, several of Kell's officers defected to Thomson's new Agency, the Home Intelligence Directorate.  MI5 therefore undertook no tangible intelligence operations of consequence during the Irish War of Independence.  MI5 did undertake the training of British Army Case Officers from the Department of Military Intelligence (DMI), for the Army's so-called 'Silent Section', otherwise known as M04(x).  Quickly trained by MI5 veterans at Hounslow Barracks, outside London, these freshly minted M04(x) Army case officers were deployed to Dublin beginning in the Spring of 1919.  Over time, 175 officers were trained and dispatched to Ireland.  In Ireland, they came under the command of General Cecil Romer and his Deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Searle Hill-Dillon."]}, {"page": "1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* 1926\u20131928 Major-General Cecil Romer"]}, {"page": "Southern Command (United Kingdom)", "response": ["*1931 - 1933 Lieutenant General Sir Cecil Romer"]}, {"page": "Western Command (United Kingdom)", "response": ["*1928 \u2013 1931 Lieutenant General Sir Cecil Romer"]}, {"page": "Robert Romer", "response": ["In 1864 he married his first cousin Betty Lemon, daughter of his aunt Helen (Nelly) Romer and Mark Lemon, editor of Punch.
