He started out with instrumental band the Strangers in Bethnal Green, East London, in the summer of 1961. In 1963 Waller adopted the name Mickey Finn \u2013 after having heard about the drummer named Micky Waller \u2013 and joined with John \"Fluff\" Cooke (keyboards), John Burkett (bass), Alan Marks (lead vocals) and Richard Brand (drums) to form \"Mickey Finn & the Blue Men\", who released their debut single in January 1964. Jimmy Page recorded with the band over the following months. With Burkett replaced by first Mick Stannard in late 1965 and then Rod Clark, the band were renamed \"The Mickey Finn\" in 1966. They released four more singles, the last of which, \"Garden of My Mind\", is their best known song and has become a cult favourite despite failing to chart at the time.\nReverting to his original name (percussionist Mickey Finn had by then become famous as a member of T.Rex), Waller played guitar with Sam Gopal (1969\u201370) and the Heavy Metal Kids (1972\u201374), before relocating to France and becoming a sought-after session musician. As Mickey Finn, he returned to the UK and joined Steve Marriott's All Stars in July 1975, and in May 1976 Finn and fellow All Star Greg Ridley (bass) formed The Fallen Angels with Twink (drums), Guy Humphries (guitar) and (initially) Bob Weston (guitar) and Keith Boyce (drums). The band crashed their van on the way to their first gig, and Finn was the only remaining original member when they re-emerged in July 1977 backing ex-Pretty Things singer Phil May.\nBy 1999, Mickey Finn & the Blue Men had reformed and recorded the Black Hole album, followed by the Go Clean EP (Ten Minutes Productions, June 2004). From 2004 to 2011, Finn formed a blues-rock duet with Joane Calice (vocals/bass).

As a session guitarist, he was known as 'Lil' Jim Pea' to prevent confusion with the other noted English session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan. Page was mainly called into sessions as \"insurance\" in instances when a replacement or second guitarist was required by the recording artist. \"It was usually myself and a drummer\", he explained, \"though they never mention the drummer these days, just me\u00a0... Anyone needing a guitarist either went to Big Jim [Sullivan] or myself.\" He stated that \"In the initial stages they just said, play what you want, cos at that time I couldn't read music or anything.\""]}, {"page": "Dave Davies", "response": ["The Kinks released three albums and several EPs in the next two years.

Some legendary on-stage fights erupted during this time as well. The most notorious incident was at the Capitol Theatre in Cardiff in May 1965, involving drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies. The fight broke out during the second number of the set, \"Beautiful Delilah\". It culminated with Davies insulting Avory and kicking over his drum set after finishing the first song, \"You Really Got Me\". Avory responded by knocking down Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious.
