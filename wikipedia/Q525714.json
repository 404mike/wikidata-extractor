On 16 January 1992, he recorded an acoustic album, accompanied by a concert film, at the Bray Studios in Bray, Berkshire. Although the production team and Clapton's staff liked the recordings, Clapton did not want to release either the album or the concert film. Finally, Clapton agreed to release the album in a limited edition. When Unplugged sold out, Clapton gave Warner Bros. and Reprise Records the permission to delete the limited album production. For the album, Clapton decided to record both new material like \"Lonely Stranger\" and old songs he grew up with such as \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\" or enjoyed listening to or had written as an adult, like \"San Francisco Bay Blues\" and \"Layla\". Clapton, who plays acoustic guitar and sings on the live track, was backed by Andy Fairweather Low who played acoustic rhythm guitar, Nathan East on acoustic bass guitar and background vocals, Ray Cooper on percussion, Steve Ferrone on drums, Katie Kissoon and Tessa Niles on background vocals as well as Chuck Leavell on piano. Pianist Chuck Leavell recalled that recording the acoustic version of \"Layla\" felt natural to him and liked that the band was given some space to play during the body of the song and not just during the reprise like it is on the original recording. \"It gave us a chance to interpret the song in our way and it did work out well and it gave it a rebirth I think.\", Leavell said. The acoustic version of \"Layla\" was produced by Russ Titelman.", "Rhythm acoustic guitar player Andy Fairweather Low was invited by Clapton to his flat in Chelsea, London to work out the songs to be recorded for the Unplugged album in January 1992. During the process, Clapton suggested that it would be a good idea to do another version of \"Layla\". Fairweather Low agreed because he had wanted to release one himself as a big Derek and the Dominos fan. Clapton thought that the perfect arrangement for the rock anthem would be a shuffle because he always liked changing the tempo of a song and looking at something from a different angle."]}, {"page": "Dereham", "response": ["*2017 Andy Fairweather Low and The Low Riders,"]}, {"page": "Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)", "response": ["* Andy Fairweather Low \u2013 acoustic guitar, mandolin, harmonica"]}, {"page": "Me and Mr. Johnson", "response": ["In the beginning of 2004, Clapton set out to record a new album, working with his long-time collaborator Simon Climie on several songs that Clapton wrote about love, peace and happiness.
