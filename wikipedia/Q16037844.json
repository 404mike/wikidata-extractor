The older is Castell Nos,Rhondda Cynon Taf Library Service, Digital Archive  Picture of the remains of Castell Nos. located at the head of the Rhondda Fach overlooking Maerdy. The only recorded evidence of Castle Nos is a mention by John Leland, who stated, \"Castelle Nose is but a high stony creg in the top of an hille\". The castle comprises a scarp and ditch forming a raised platform and on the north face is a ruined dry-stone building. Its location and form do not appear to be Norman and it is thought to have been built by the Welsh as a border defence, which would date it before 1247, when Richard de Clare seized Glynrhondda.Davis (1989), p. 25. The second castle is Ynysygrug, close to what is now Tonypandy town centre. Little remains of this motte-and-bailey earthwork defence, as much was destroyed when Tonypandy railway station was built in the 19th century.Davis (1989), p. 26. Ynysygrug is dated around the 12th or early 13th century and has been misidentified by several historians, notably Owen Morgan in his History of Pontypridd and Rhondda Valleys, who recorded it as a druidic sacred mound.Davis (1989), p. 26, \"Morgan not only misidentifies the height of the 30-ft. mound as 100 ft. but states that '...all these sacred mounds were reared in this country... when Druidism was the established religion', but gives no historic proof. The book also has an illustration of the castle to which the artist has added a moat and several druids, neither of which are factual.\" Iolo Morganwg erroneously believed it to be the burial mound of king Rhys ap Tewdwr."]}, {"page": "1921 in Wales", "response": ["*16 December - Owen Morgan, journalist, 85"]}, {"page": "Gilfach Goch", "response": ["The translation of Gilfach Goch into English is easily understood (cil = nook or secluded area, bach = small) but several theories have been put forward as to where the name came from, especially the term coch = red. Writing in 1887, Thomas Morgan, put forward the idea that the name was derived from \"...a heap of red cinders, which still remains as a memento of the ironworks that stood there in times of yore\". Owen Morgan, a local historian, theorised that the area was the location of an ancient site of importance to the local druids. During the Roman Conquest of Britain, Roman cavalry attacked the 'defenceless of Dinas', but were routed when thousands heeded the call of the Druids. Morgan concludes that coch refers to the blood shed by the defeated Roman soldiers."]}, {"page": "List of writers on modern Paganism", "response": ["* Owen Morgan (1836 \u2013 1921), Welsh journalist, historian and writer"]}]}}
