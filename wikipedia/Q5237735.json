A new generation of innovative poets has also sprung up in the wake of the Revival grouping, notably Caroline Bergvall, Tony Lopez, Allen Fisher and Denise Riley.Don Paterson, \"The Dark Art of Poetry\": T.S.

British critic David Morley has defined Harrison as the writer of \"some of the most brilliant metaphysical nature poems of our time.\"  Michael Farrell, however, considers the subjective side of his work in the preface to the Out of the Box anthology (Puncher and Wattman], Sydney 2009) describing his poetry as about selfhood caught in the process of learning, in which \"learning the self and world are in alternation.\" Nigel Wheale captures a similar sense, reviewing The Kangaroo Farm in the London Review of Books (20:19, 1998), describing the poems as attempts to create \"livable locales\" and a form of pursuit for places where, in Wheale's words, \"ordinary happiness might reside.\""]}, {"page": "Neil Astley", "response": ["Astley has commissioned books representing or addressing the poetry of particular generations or periods in British and Irish poetry, including the anthologies A Rumoured City (introduced by Philip Larkin, edited by Douglas Dunn, 1982),  The New Poetry (edited by Michael Hulse, David Kennedy and David Morley, 1993), The Bloodaxe Book of 20th Century Poetry from Britain and Ireland (edited by Edna Longley, 2000), The New Irish Poets (edited by Selina Guinness, 2004), Voice Recognition (edited by James Byrne and Clare Pollard, 2009), Identity Parade: New Poets from Britain and Ireland (edited by Roddy Lumsden, 2010) and Dear World & Everyone In It: new poetry in the UK (edited by Nathan Hamilton, 2013).
