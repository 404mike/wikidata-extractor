In 1895 he won the Sedgwick prize. At Cambridge University, Woods was from 1892 to 1899 a demonstrator in paleobotany, and from 1894 to 1899 a demonstrator in paleozoology until his promotion to lecturer. From 1899 until his retirement in 1934 he was a lecturer in paleontology at Cambridge. In 1910 he married paleontologist Ethel Skeat, the daughter of Walter William Skeat, professor of Anglo-Saxon. Even after his retirement, Woods remained at the university as a librarian for the paleontology department until he was over eighty.\nIn 1940 Woods received the Wollaston Medal and in 1918 the Lyell Medal. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1916.\nHe is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge; his wife is buried with him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wollaston Medal", "response": ["*1940 Henry Woods"]}, {"page": "Henry Woods", "response": ["Henry Woods may refer to:", "* Henry Woods (Pennsylvania politician) (1764\u20131826), American congressman", "* Henry Woods (geologist) (1868\u20131952), British geologist", "* Henry Woods (painter) (1846\u20131921), English painter", "* Henry Woods (judge) (1918\u20132002), American judge", "* Henry Woods (MP) (1822\u20131882), English cotton manufacturer, colliery owner and Liberal MP", "* Henry Woods (British Army officer) (1924\u20132019), British general", "* Henry Woods (footballer) (born 1999), Gillingham footballer"]}, {"page": "Lyell Medal", "response": ["* 1918 Henry Woods"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society W, X, Y, Z", "response": ["|Henry Woods||11/05/1916||18 December 1868 \u2013 4 April 1952"]}, {"page": "List of paleontologists", "response": ["* Henry Woods (England, 1868-1952)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1916", "response": ["*Henry Woods"]}, {"page": "Ethel Skeat", "response": ["Woods was privately educated until the age of 25, when she entered Newnham College, Cambridge.

Peach had however never examined the holotype in person (basing his diagnosis on images alone) and some researchers, such as Henry Woods in 1909, noted that its classification was still uncertain."]}]}}
