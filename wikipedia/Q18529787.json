His brother was the doctor and surgeon James Burnes. At the age of sixteen, Alexander joined the army of the East India Company and while serving in India, he learned Urdu and Persian, and obtained an appointment as interpreter at Surat in 1822. Transferred to Kutch in 1826 as assistant to the political agent, he took an interest in the history and geography of north-western India and the adjacent countries, which had not yet been thoroughly explored by the British; he then went to Afghanistan."]}, {"page": "Montrose Academy", "response": ["The school awards the Dux medal yearly, an award which has been said to have been first instituted in honour of Alexander Burnes; the medal itself is inscribed with the name of James Burnes (1801\u20131862), whose brother Alexander (1805\u20131841) was killed in Afghanistan. The Dux medal has been awarded since at least 1896 but possibly for much longer - the medal is inscribed 'Jacobo Burnes Indiam Relinquit MDCCCXLIX' and 'Academiae Montis Rosarum Fratres Latomi Bombaiensis' which suggests that the original medal was presented to James Burnes on leaving India in 1849 by brother freemasons from Montrose Academy living in Bombay.1962 Burnes Dux Medal presented to Ian R Downie Other long-standing prizes include the Warrack Essay Prize (gifted by Sir James Howard Warrack), Duke Medal (for Mathematics) and the Henry Steele Prize (awarded for History).

He introduced the Knights Templar as the bearers on Freemasonry to Scotland, and had the Templars play a crucial part in the battle. This appears to be the basis of subsequent tales of Templar involvement at Bannockburn. The contemporary Royal Order of Scotland makes use of a similar foundation myth, which is no more intended to be taken as historical fact than any other piece of masonic allegory.Robert L.D.
