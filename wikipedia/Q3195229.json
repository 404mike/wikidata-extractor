Smith and his team undertook some serious surgery to the side. He signed experienced defenders David Weir, Ugo Ehiogu and Andy Webster to shore up the rocky backline. This proved to be a steadying influence on the team and they only lost three times until the end of the season, although Webster injured himself during his first training session at the club and did not make his debut until September 2007.", "On the football front, Rangers league campaign began with a defeat to newly relegated Hearts with the Edinburgh club scoring an extra minute winner. Despite embarking on a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions, a loss at home to Hibernian left the side trailing Hearts by six-points at the top of the league by the end of September. Better news for Rangers was the reaching of the League Cup semi-final after a 1\u20130 win over St Johnstone, being drawn against Celtic which set up the first Old Firm derby in two years. Nevertheless, the club's title charge was effectively ended in November as the side lost a six-pointer match away to league leaders Hearts leaving them nine points behind. The did bounce back the following week in the Scottish Cup registering a 3\u20130 win over Scottish Premiership side Kilmarnock, however, in the club's third cup competition the team surrendered a 2\u20130 lead to lose 3\u20132 to fellow Championship team Alloa Athletic in the Challenge Cup. Even with the poor league form and exit in the Challenge Cup, there was no indication of significant pressure on manager Ally McCoist. The effect of the club's financial issues as underlined by the interim results that November, proved the catalyst for McCoist's departure as he became unhappy with the number of staff losing their jobs at Rangers. The situation became too much for McCoist and he tendered his resignation on 12 December which was later confirmed to the London Stock Exchange by the club three days later, with McCoist beginning a 12-month notice period. However, he was to serve less than a week of his notice period before being placed on gardening leave by the board, with his assistant manager Kenny McDowall being appointed interim manager until the end of the season.", "After poor results in both league and Scottish Cup, Stuart McCall replaced Kenny McDowall as interim manager. At the end of March it was revealed that Rangers five loan signings from Newcastle United were signed without medicals. On same day as interim accounts were published, 31 March, it emerged that Rangers would have owed Newcastle United \u00a3500,000 if they were promoted due to the agreement struck when loaning the players. It was announced on 2 April that Rangers would be de-listed from the AIM stock exchange after failing to find a Nominated adviser within the required period. The SPFL courted controversy with the final day fixtures by moving the Rangers v Hearts match from Saturday to Sunday, with the rest of the matches proceeding on the Saturday. This could have given Rangers a possible advantage in the chase for second place, however, the SPFL performed a U-turn, with all matches being scheduled for early Saturday afternoon As it was, the team failed to be automatically promoted to the Premiership, drawing the final two league matches and finishing a disappointing third in the league. This meant the club faced at least six play-off matches in order to gain promotion. The ticket pricing of these matches attracted controversy. Following a precedent set by Hibernian the previous season, Rangers stated they would allow season ticket holders entry to home matches for free; however, this was rejected by the SPFL. Not to be deterred, Rangers then announced a blanket \u00a35 ticket price offer for all seats. The side successfully negotiated two play-off rounds before crashing to a 6-1 aggregate defeat to premiership team Motherwell. The second leg of the play-off final ended in controversy as Rangers Bilel Mohsni and Motherwell's Lee Erwin brawled on the pitch after the match as Motherwell fans invade the pitch to goad the Rangers fans."]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Kenny McDowall"]}, {"page": "List of association football families", "response": ["* Garry McDowall,  Kenny McDowall (brother)"]}]}}
