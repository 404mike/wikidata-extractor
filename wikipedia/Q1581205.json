He met Jim Capaldi, who later played with Traffic, with whom he formed a group called Deep Feelin.\nLater he joined a group called The V.I.P.'s, in which Keith Emerson played for some time. The V.I.P.'s were renamed Art and later became Spooky Tooth. After leaving Spooky Tooth, he released a solo album, Under Open Skies (Island Records, 1971).For contractual reasons, he changed his name to Ariel Bender, at the suggestion of singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul, for his stint with the Mott the Hoople. According to Mott's lead singer Ian Hunter, interviewed in the documentary The Ballad of Mott the Hoople, the band were in Germany with Lynsey de Paul for the TV show, Hits-a-Go-Go in Germany on 24 June 1973 when lead guitarist Mick Ralphs walked down a street bending a succession of car aerials in frustration. De Paul came out with the phrase \"aerial bender\", which Hunter later suggested to Grosvenor as a stage name. Grosvenor joined the band in 1973, replacing Ralphs. Grosvenor toured with Mott in 1973 and 1974 and performed on the band's seventh album, The Hoople (1974).The years with Spooky Tooth (1967 to 1970), Stealers Wheel (1973) and Mott the Hoople (1973 to 1974) were the most successful years in Grosvenor's musical career. After leaving Mott in 1974 - he was replaced by Mick Ronson - Grosvenor published a few solo albums, and formed Widowmaker, releasing Widowmaker in 1976 and Too Late to Cry in 1977.\nIn 1995, he recorded two tracks for Viceroy Music's tribute to Peter Green along with former Spooky Tooth drummer Mike Kellie. These songs led to Grosvenor signing a deal with the New York City based Brilliant Recording Company and produced the Floodgates album. It was released on 15 August 1996. The album again featured Mike Kellie on drums and featured Jess Roden singing vocals on two tracks, Grosvenor did the vocals on the rest of the album. The album was produced by Grosvenor and Mick Dolan.\nIn 1999, Grosvenor returned in a Spooky Tooth reunion (without Gary Wright), and recorded Cross Purpose again for the Brilliant Recording Company. In 2005, he revived his pseudonym, forming the Ariel Bender Band. In 2007 and 2008, he performed under the name Ariel Bender's Mott The Hoople, performing both Spooky Tooth and Mott The Hoople songs, as well as cover songs.\nIn 2009, he worked with London act, The Winter Olympics, recording guitar parts for their song, \"The Great Outdoors\", which was released in August 2010.\nIn June 2018, performing as Ariel Bender, Grosvenor played three Mott The Hoople reunion shows with Hunter and 1974 Mott pianist Morgan Fisher, backed by Hunter's Rant Band.  The shows were at festivals in Spain and the United Kingdom and a concert in Norway. In April 2019, performing as Ariel Bender, Grosvenor played 14 Mott the Hoople reunion shows \u2013 eight in the U.S., six in the U.K. \u2013 with Hunter and 1974 Mott pianist Morgan Fisher, backed by Hunter's Rant Band.

It was re-recorded in 1974, with Ariel Bender on guitar, for the subsequent The Hoople album, with de Paul speaking the same part. (Most available recordings of this version have a strange unintended distortion on her vocal, which was fixed on later reissues).

In 1973, when Mick Ralphs left Mott the Hoople, his replacement Luther Grosvenor was contractually obliged to change his name \u2013 de Paul suggested Ariel Bender. In February 1974, de Paul was voted top female singer in the UK music weekly Disc Readers Awards Poll, while David Bowie was voted top male singer and Slade the top group. After appointing Don Arden her new manager at the end of 1973, in part because her former manager Harold Davison fell ill earlier that year, de Paul released \"Ooh I Do\" in May 1974, which hit the charts in the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Brazil and Japan. The song's co-writer, Barry Blue, also recorded a version of the song as an album track with different lyrics for the verses. De Paul also wrote her first TV theme tune (\"Pilger theme\") for Pilger where journalist, John Pilger, examined various political issues at the time (1974-1977) in a series of 25 minute documentaries.  Another theme song, this time co-written with Barry Blue, was recorded and released as a single by the UK group, Rain, featuring Stephanie de Sykes as the vocalist.
