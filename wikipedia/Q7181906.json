On 1 March 2009, it was announced that Megson had agreed a new rolling contract with Bolton. He celebrated his new contract with a 1\u20130 victory over Newcastle United.

However, Allardyce's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused to sanction greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification.

Meanwhile, there appeared to be problems at the club behind-the-scenes, marked by the confusion when Gary Speed stepped down as player-coach. However, there was little confusion to what happened following Bolton's 1\u20130 home defeat to Chelsea on 15 October, with Lee being relieved of his duties on the Monday.

This brought an end to their three match losing streak but meant they still hadn't won a league game this season, extending their winless start to the season to six games.

Anthony Wordsworth put Rotherham in front in the first half but Joe Mason scored two to bring Bolton ahead with ten minutes remaining on the clock.
