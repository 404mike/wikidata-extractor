He had a \"car crash\" beginning to the 2010\u201311 season, after being dropped by manager Andy Scott due to a poor performance during pre-season. He spent the early months of the season behind Simon Moore and loanees Alex McCarthy and Ben Hamer in the pecking order and appeared only in cup matches. After starting his first league game of the season against Bournemouth on 2 November 2010, he cemented his place in the team. Brentford's League Cup and Football League Trophy runs were the highlights of his season, helping the Bees to win four penalty shootouts to send them to the fourth round of the League Cup and the final of the Football League Trophy. He missed the Football League Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium and the rest of the season with a dislocated right shoulder suffered in March 2011.

He made just five appearances during Brentford's promotion-winning 2013\u201314 season and spent much of the season as backup to new signing David Button, though he won a promotion medal by virtue of being an unused substitute on the final day of the season versus Stevenage."]}, {"page": "Joe Garner", "response": ["Garner signed a one-month loan deal with Carlisle United on 18 September 2012, confirming his second spell with the club.

The departure of Simon Moore to Cardiff City and injury to Richard Lee saw Button begin the season as manager Uwe R\u00f6sler's first-choice goalkeeper. Button started each of Brentford's opening six league games, but disaster struck on 7 September against Bradford City when with the score at 0\u20130, Button received a straight red card for a challenge on Bradford player Nahki Wells just outside the penalty box after 26 minutes. During his three-match suspension, Jack Bonham and then the fit-again Richard Lee took over the goalkeeping position. Button made his next appearance in a 1\u20130 defeat to Rotherham United on 5 October and regained his position as first-choice goalkeeper. An open forum between players and management in the dressing room after a 2\u20131 defeat to Stevenage on 12 October saw a turnaround in the team's fortunes and the beginning of a run of nine consecutive wins in the league, with Button appearing in eight of those matches and keeping seven clean sheets. With Button as a virtual ever-present, the Bees secured automatic promotion to the Championship after a 1\u20130 win over Preston North End on 18 April 2014. Button made 45 appearances and kept 20 clean sheets in league matches during the 2013\u201314 season.

Three days later, on 9 April, Stevenage welcomed Preston North End to Broadhall Way, signalling the return of former manager Graham Westley, who left Stevenage in January 2012 to take up the vacant position at Deepdale. The game ended 1\u20131, stretching Stevenage's winless run to seven league games. Preston took the lead with just four minutes remaining, with substitute Iain Hume sliding the ball in from six yards out following Danny Mayor's through ball. Stevenage then equalised in the fourth minute of injury time, with captain Mark Roberts heading in Michael Bostwick's floated cross to ensure a share of the spoils. The result meant that Stevenage were in ninth position, six points away from the final play-off place with just six games remaining. Stevenage travelled to in-form Yeovil Town five days after the draw with Preston, looking to secure a first away win in just under two months. Stevenage won the match 6\u20130, recording their biggest Football League victory to date, as well as recording the joint biggest away victory of 2011\u201312 League One campaign. Stevenage took an early lead in the match when Patrick Agyemang was played into the area by Craig Reid, Agyemang then squared the ball across goal for Luke Freeman to score from close range. Yeovil were reduced to ten men when Michael Woods fouled Michael Bostwick. Agyemang scored Stevenage's second goal when he collected Jamaal Lascelles long pass, before calmly beating Sam Walker in the Yeovil goal. Two goals within the space of three second half minutes put the game beyond doubt, with Jon Ashton and Lascelles scoring headers from set pieces. Mark Roberts added a fifth goal with ten minutes remaining \u2014 prodding in Freeman's centre. Freeman then scored his second, and Stevenage's sixth, when Jordan Slew made room down the right wing after a neat interchange with Agyemang, before finding Freeman at the back post to tap in from six yards out. The club then welcomed play-off rivals Carlisle United to Broadhall Way, knowing that a defeat would virtually end the club's play-off hopes. Stevenage dominated the first-half, but were unable to take an advantage into the interval. The second half was a much more even affair, with both teams spurning goalscoring opportunities. The deadlock was broken with just fifteen minutes remaining, substitute John Mousinho, returning from a six-month injury lay-off, latched onto Stacy Long's chipped through ball, before crashing the ball into the goal off the crossbar. Four days later, on 21 April, Stevenage hosted another team hoping to snatch the final play-off place when Brentford travelled to Broadhall Way. Stevenage secured a 2\u20131 victory, consequently ending Brentford's play-off hopes in the process. The visitors had the opportunity to take the lead on the half hour mark when Jamaal Lascelles was adjudged to have pushed Clinton Morrison in the area. However, Clayton Donaldson's penalty rebounded off the crossbar and Stevenage were able to clear to ensure the teams went in level at half-time. Brentford were then handed another chance from the penalty spot five minutes after the interval, this time the referee deemed Jon Ashton to have fouled Morrison. Brentford's Sam Saunders stepped up and his powerful penalty rebounded off the post and into the arms of Chris Day. Just three minutes after the second penalty miss, Stevenage were one goal to the good. Craig Reid controlled Lawrie Wilson's low cross, before hitting a shot on the turn that bounced off the ground and past Brentford goalkeeper Simon Moore. Luke Freeman then doubled Stevenage's advantage ten minutes later, dispossessing Adam Thompson before cutting in and hitting a right-footed shot that crashed into the goal off the post. Saunders reduced the deficit in injury-time with a curling free-kick, although Stevenage held on to secure a vital victory. The third straight victory, coupled with Notts County's home loss to Bury, meant that Stevenage were back in the play-off places with just two games remaining. Stevenage then travelled to Bramall Lane to face Sheffield United in a game that was televised live on Sky Sports on 28 April, and attracted a crowd of over 30,000 spectators. The game was an evening kick-off, meaning Stevenage had moved down to seventh in the league table as a result of Notts County's 4\u20133 win at Wycombe Wanderers earlier in the day. The game ended 2\u20132, with Stevenage taking a two-goal lead through strikes from Joel Byrom and Scott Laird, before Sheffield United's Richard Cresswell and Matthew Lowton restored parity. The draw meant that Stevenage had regained their place in sixth with just one game remaining."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["March began with a sixth straight defeat, with the club losing 2\u20130 at home to Colchester United. Two second-half Jabo Ibehre goals proved to be the difference. Just three days later, on 5 March, Stevenage ended their run of defeats by beating high-flying Brentford 1\u20130 at Broadhall Way. Having dominated the match for large spells, the home side took the lead with fifteen minutes left when Marcus Haber dinked the ball over Simon Moore in the Brentford goal. Stevenage then lost 2\u20130 away to Preston North End on 9 March, with goals from Lee Holmes and Will Hayhurst in the opening fifteen minutes settling the match. Another defeat followed three days later, with the club losing 1\u20130 at home to Bournemouth. A first-half Brett Pitman penalty was the only goal of the game, as Darius Charles was sent-off late-on for a second bookable offence. Stevenage's next match, played four days later, was a 4\u20130 home victory over second-placed Sheffield United. Returning from a loan spell at Barnet, striker Dani L\u00f3pez made his first start for the club; opening the scoring just before half-time after turning Neill Collins inside the area and beating George Long in the Sheffield United goal. He then added a second shortly after the interval when he neatly converted a chipped through ball by Gavin Mahon.  L\u00f3pez scored his hat-trick just after the hour mark when Anthony Grant broke free and played a through ball to the Spanish forward, who then unleashed an unstoppable shot from just inside the area. Lucas Akins added Stevenage's fourth goal of the match with twenty minutes to go when he cut inside and beat Long with a low curling shot. Just three days after the club's impressive win over Sheffield United, Stevenage lost 2\u20130 to bottom-placed Bury at Gigg Lane. Goals from Craig Jones and Jonson Clarke-Harris, both of which coming within the final ten minutes of the match, proved to be the difference. Stevenage goalkeeper Steve Arnold also saved a first-half Steven Schumacher penalty. A day after the defeat by Bury, on 20 March, Stevenage announced that manager Gary Smith had been sacked following a run of 14 defeats in 18 games. Stevenage captain Mark Roberts was placed in caretaker charge while the club searched for a new manager, but could not prevent a 3\u20131 defeat by Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park on 24 March, a game that was televised live on Sky Sports. Tranmere went ahead after ten minutes when Zoumana Bakayoko tapped in from close range, before Stevenage equalised almost instantly courtesy of a curling Luke Freeman free-kick. Just three minutes later, on the fifteen-minute mark, Tranmere had regained their lead; Stevenage failed to clear a Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro shot and the ball fell to defender Ben Gibson, whose shot went in following a deflection off David Gray. Bakayoko then doubled his goal tally and Tranmere's advantage shortly before the interval when he tucked away Paul Black's through pass. Five days later, Roberts took charge of the side for their trip to Broadfield Stadium to face Crawley Town. Full back Miguel Comminges was sent-off for two bookable offences after just half an hour. Despite being a man light, Stevenage took the lead just before the interval when David Gray headed on Luke Freeman's free-kick, and Roberts was on hand to head the ball into the goal from six yards. Crawley equalised ten minutes into the second-half after Matt Sparrow tucked the ball into the bottom corner of the goal. Both sides had chances to take all three points, but the game ended 1\u20131. A day after the draw to Crawley, on 30 March, Stevenage announced that Graham Westley had been re-appointed as the club's new manager, his third spell in-charge of the Hertfordshire side."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["The match versus Doncaster Rovers (played in front of a sold out 12,300 crowd at Griffin Park) was tense and mostly played in midfield.
