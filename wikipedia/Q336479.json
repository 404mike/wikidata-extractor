He was the son of Sir Henry Ponsonby, Private Secretary to Queen Victoria and Mary Elizabeth Bulteel, daughter of John Crocker Bulteel. He was also the great-grandson of The 3rd Earl of Bessborough, The 3rd Earl of Bathurst and The 2nd Earl Grey. The 1st Baron Sysonby was his elder brother.\nPonsonby is often quoted as the author of the dictum \"When war is declared, truth is the first casualty\", published in his book Falsehood in War-time, Containing an Assortment of Lies Circulated Throughout the Nations During the Great War (1928). However, he uses this phrase in quotation marks as an epigram at the start of the book and does not present it as his own words.  Its likely origin is the almost identical line spoken in 1917 by the United States Senator Hiram Johnson: \"The first casualty when war comes is truth\".", "link_mentions": []}}
