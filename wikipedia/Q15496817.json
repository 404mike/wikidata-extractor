As an accomplished entertainer, he was described by one New York Theatre critic as a combination of \"No\u00ebl Coward, Flanders and Swann with a touch of Quentin Crisp\". He wrote and performed in numerous musicals and revues. In the West End, he succeeded Dudley Moore, in Beyond the Fringe, appeared in his own revue One in the Eye and appeared with Tom Conti, in An Italian Straw Hat. He worked with many notable performers, such as Bette Davis, Elizabeth Taylor, Angela Lansbury, David Niven, Alec Guinness and Evelyn Laye.\nDalby taught singing at the Actor's Richmond Company, which he formed into an admirable performing group and during his 70s he was Musical Director, arranger and helped compile programmes for the company \"Muse & Music\"  which performed anthologies of poetry, prose and song at The Jermyn Street Theatre as well as various other venues for charities.
