R. Johnson, was a Trinidadian historian, journalist and Marxist. His works are influential in various theoretical, social, and historiographical contexts. His work is a staple of Marxism, and he figures as a pioneering and influential voice in postcolonial literature. A tireless political activist, James is the author of the 1937 work World Revolution outlining the history of the Communist International, which stirred debate in Trotskyist circles, and in 1938 he wrote on the Haitian Revolution, The Black Jacobins.Characterised by one literary critic as an \"anti-Stalinist dialectician\", James was known for his autodidactism, for his occasional playwriting and fiction \u2013 his 1936 book Minty Alley was the first novel by a black West Indian to be published in Britain \u2013 and as an avid sportsman. He is also famed as a writer on cricket, and his 1963 book Beyond a Boundary, which he himself described as \"neither cricket reminiscences nor autobiography\", is commonly named as the best single book on cricket, and even the best book about sports ever written.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen", "response": ["The declaration did not revoke the institution of slavery, as lobbied for by Jacques-Pierre Brissot's Les Amis des Noirs and defended by the group of colonial planters called the Club Massiac because they met at the H\u00f4tel Massiac.The club of reactionary colonial proprietors meeting since July 1789 were opposed to representation in the Assembl\u00e9e of France's overseas dominions, for fear \"that this would expose delicate colonial issues to the hazards of debate in the Assembly\", as Robin Blackburn expressed it (Blackburn, The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery, 1776\u20131848 [1988:174f]); see also the speech of Jean-Baptiste Belley Despite the lack of explicit mention of slavery in the Declaration, slave uprisings in Saint-Domingue in the Haitian Revolution were inspired by it, as discussed in C.

In 1943 Nkrumah met Trinidadian Marxist C. L. R. James, Russian expatriate Raya Dunayevskaya, and Chinese-American Grace Lee Boggs, all of whom were members of an American-based Marxist intellectual cohort. Nkrumah later credited James with teaching him \"how an underground movement worked\". Federal Bureau of Investigation files on Nkrumah, kept from January to May 1945, identify him as a possible communist. Nkrumah was determined to go to London, wanting to continue his education there now that the Second World War had ended. James, in a 1945 letter introducing Nkrumah to Trinidad-born George Padmore in London, wrote: \"This young man is coming to you. He is not very bright, but nevertheless do what you can for him because he's determined to throw Europeans out of Africa.\"", "Nkrumah was also best-known politically for his strong commitment to and promotion of pan-Africanism. He was inspired by the writings of black intellectuals such as Marcus Garvey, W. E. B. Du Bois, and George Padmore, and his relationships with them. Much of his understanding and relationship to these men was created during his years in America as a student. Some would argue that his greatest inspiration was Marcus Garvey, although he also had a meaningful relationship with C. L. R. James. Nkrumah looked to these men to craft a general solution to the ills of Africa. To follow in these intellectual footsteps Nkrumah had intended to continue his education in London, but found himself involved in direct activism. Then, motivated by advice from Du Bois, Nkrumah decided to focus on creating peace in Africa. He became a passionate advocate of the \"African Personality\" embodied in the slogan \"Africa for the Africans\" earlier popularised by Edward Wilmont Blyden and he viewed political independence as a prerequisite for economic independence. Nkrumah's dedications to pan-Africanism in action attracted these intellectuals to his Ghanaian projects. Many Americans, such as Du Bois and Kwame Ture, moved to Ghana to join him in his efforts. These men are buried there today.Afari-Gyan, Kwadwo. \"Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore and W. E. B. Du Bois\", Research Review (NS) vol. 7 (1991): 1\u20135. Print.

Leslie Caron said that he was the most talented leading man she worked with. David Shipman writes that \"more than most stars, he belonged to the public\". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal stated in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) that, if it \"weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality, the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all\". Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a \"new and very important symbol\", a new type of Englishman who differed from Leslie Howard and Ronald Colman, who represented the \"freedom, natural grace, simplicity, and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan\", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America."]}, {"page": "Eric Williams", "response": ["He completed the D.Phil in 1938 under the supervision of Vincent Harlow.
