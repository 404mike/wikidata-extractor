Deprived of his office in 1690 for refusing to swear allegiance to William and Mary, he later enabled and supported the consecration of new nonjuring bishops leading to the nonjuring schism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mary II of England", "response": ["James had a controversial religious policy; his attempt to grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans by suspending acts of Parliament by royal decree was not well received.Van der Kiste, p. 91 Mary considered such action illegal, and her chaplain expressed this view in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, on her behalf.Waller, p. 265 She was further dismayed when James refused to help when the Catholic king of France, Louis XIV, invaded Orange and persecuted Huguenot refugees there. In an attempt to damage William, James encouraged his daughter's staff to inform her that William was having an affair with Elizabeth Villiers, the daughter of her childhood governess Frances Villiers. Acting on the information, Mary waited outside Villiers's room and caught her husband leaving it late at night. William denied adultery, and Mary apparently believed and forgave him.Van der Kiste, p. 81; Waller, p. 264 Possibly, Villiers and William were not meeting as lovers but to exchange diplomatic intelligence.Van der Kiste p. 64; Waller, p. 264 Mary's staff was dismissed and sent back to Britain.Van der Kiste, p. 82; Waller, p. 264", "The bishop of London, Henry Compton (one of the \"Immortal Seven\"), crowned William and Mary together at Westminster Abbey on 11 April 1689. Normally, the archbishop of Canterbury performs coronations, but the incumbent archbishop, William Sancroft, although an Anglican, refused to recognise the validity of James II's removal. Neither William nor Mary enjoyed the ceremony; she thought it \"all vanity\" and William called it \"Popish\".Van der Kiste, p. 118 On the same day, the Convention of the Estates of Scotland\u2014which was much more divided than the English Parliament\u2014finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland, that \"no Papist can be King or Queen of this Realm\", that William and Mary would be joint sovereigns, and that William would exercise sole and full power.

The design process took several years, but a design was finally settled and attached to a royal warrant, with the proviso that Wren was permitted to make any further changes that he deemed necessary. The result was the present St Paul's Cathedral, still the second largest church in Britain, with a dome proclaimed as the finest in the world. The building was financed by a tax on coal, and was completed within its architect's lifetime with many of the major contractors engaged for the duration."]}]}}
