He has also worked at Jazz FM, BBC Radio 2, and Y100 in Florida, United States. His television credits include Gladiators, 4 Square, Take Your Pick!, The Brian Conley Show and Dancing on Ice. \nHe has worked on a variety of television and radio adverts.

New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. I. This led Philip Schaff and late-nineteenth century Christian universalists such as J. W. Hanson to describe Gregory's theology as universalist.Hanson, JW Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine Of The Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years. Chapter XV: Gregory Nazianzen. Boston and Chicago Universalist Publishing House, 1899. This view of Gregory is also held by some modern theologians such as John Sachs, who said that Gregory had \"leanings\" toward apocatastasis, but in a \"cautious, undogmatic\" way.Sachs, John R. \"Apocatastasis in Patristic Theology.\" Theological Studies. 54 (December 1993), p. 632. However, it is not clear or universally accepted that Gregory held to the doctrine of apocatastasis.David L. Balas, \"Apokatastasis\" in The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, second edition, ed. Everett Ferguson (New York: Garland Publishing, 1997), details Gregory of Nyssa's adherence to the doctrine, while making no mention of Nazianzan."]}, {"page": "Capital London", "response": ["*John Sachs"]}, {"page": "List of game show hosts", "response": ["| John Sachs || United Kingdom || 4 Square (1989-1991), Gladiators (1992-2000)"]}, {"page": "Andrew Sachs", "response": ["In 1960, Sachs married the actress, writer, and fashion designer Melody Lang, who took his surname.
