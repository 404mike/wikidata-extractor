He had to face some less known challengers in this division, one exception being the famous prospect Ray Mancini (known as \"Boom Boom\" Mancini). Mancini and Arg\u00fcello engaged in a fight that was later showcased in a boxing video of the best fights of the 1980s, with Arg\u00fcello prevailing by stoppage when he decked Mancini in round 14. After the fight, Arg\u00fcello gained many American fans when he embraced Mancini and told a CBS Television audience that he would do anything to help Mancini's father, who at the time was dealing with illness.
