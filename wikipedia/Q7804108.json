He is a left-handed batsman and a slow left-arm bowler. He has played for Essex since the age of 18.\nPhillips usually bats at around 7/8/9 for Essex and has been known to rescue his team from ominous situations with useful scores. His bowling is slow left arm orthodox. He struggled to make his name a permanent fixture on the Essex teamsheet between his debut in 1999 and 2010 due to the presence of Pakistani legspinner Danish Kaneria for six of those years. However, in the 2011 season, following Kaneria's departure, Phillips looks to have gained an Essex starting place in all forms of the game, a fact outlined by the fact that Essex chose not to sign another spinner to replace Kaneria. Tim Phillips is also a very capable fielder. He often fields at either third slip or gully, and very rarely drops catches.\nPhillips famously bowled Kevin Pietersen, playing his first home game for Hampshire, for a five-ball duck.  More recently, Phillips has taken part in the Twenty20 Cup, turning in some sturdy bowling performances and employing clever technique, helping his team reach the semi-final stage for the first time.\nPhillips claimed man of the match in the Twenty 20 quarter final with figures of 2-11, taking Essex through to finals day for the first time ever. In 2009 Phillips returned to the squad having undergone surgery on his knee, to take another Man of the Match award for his 5-38 and 41 runs in the Pro 40 clash with Somerset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Essex County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["*   Tim Phillips", "At the Rose Bowl, Hampshire Hawks batted first, scoring 175 for 9, as Tim Phillips took 3 for 31.

Hodge was dropped on 32, and Lancashire might have been put under pressure if it had been taken, but instead he went on to make 82 off 102 balls before he was caught behind off Tim Phillips, as Lancashire made their target with 6 wickets and 6 overs to spare.
