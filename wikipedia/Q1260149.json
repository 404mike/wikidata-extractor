Originally based in the East End of London, the club moved across the River Thames in 1910 to south east London and support is drawn from the surrounding areas. The club and fans have a historic association with football hooliganism, which came to prevalence in the 1970s and 1980s with a firm known originally as F-Troop, eventually becoming more widely known as the Millwall Bushwackers, who were one of the most notorious hooligan gangs in England. On five occasions The Den was closed by The FA and the club has received numerous fines for crowd disorder. The BBC documentary Panorama was invited into the club by Millwall in 1977 to show the hooligan reputation was a myth and being blown out of proportion by reporting. Instead the BBC portrayed hooliganism as being deeply rooted in Millwall, and attempted to link them to the far-right political party National Front. The show was extremely damaging for the club. Former club chairman Reg Burr once commented: \"Millwall are a convenient coat peg for football to hang its social ills on\", an example being the reporting of convicted murderer Gavin Grant. Although he had played for eight different clubs, playing his fewest games (four) for Millwall, and was signed to Bradford City at the time, the BBC used the headline, \"Former Millwall striker Gavin Grant guilty of murder\"."]}, {"page": "Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.", "response": ["The team played a very consistent first half of the 2005\u201306 season but injuries and the loss of star player Gavin Grant to Gillingham saw the team lose some of their cutting edge and start to falter. At the end of this season Cadette was sacked as the team once again failed to gain promotion following defeat in the playoff semi-finals to Tonbridge Angels. Former player Billy Smith was appointed as manager for the start of the 2006\u201307 season, in which the club won the Surrey Senior Cup and London Senior Cup. In May 2008, the club secured promotion to the Isthmian League Premier Division by defeating Cray Wanderers 1\u20130 at Imperial Fields."]}, {"page": "Millwall Bushwackers", "response": ["Former club chairman Reg Burr once commented: \"Millwall are a convenient coat peg for football to hang its social ills on\", an example being the reporting of convicted murderer Gavin Grant.
