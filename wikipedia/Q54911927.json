We know that the mixed, but largely British and Frankish population of Kent repackaged themselves as 'Jutes', and the largely British populations in the lands east of Dumnonia (Devon and Cornwall) seem to have ended up as 'West Saxons'. In western Armorica, the small \u00e9lite which managed to impose an identity on the population happened to be British rather than 'Gallo-Roman' in origin, so they became Bretons. The process may have been essentially the same.\"Martin Henig, British Archaeology, 2003, review of The British Settlement of Brittany by Pierre-Roland Giot, Philippe Guigon & Bernard Merdrignac", "* Martin Henig, review in British Archaeology 72(September 2003)"]}, {"page": "Quoit brooch", "response": ["Most scholars now agree that the style developed mainly from provincial late Roman metalwork styles, apparently drawing elements from both the relatively low-status jewellery found in military graves in northern Gaul and England such as belt buckles and fittings, and also late-Roman luxury work such as the style in one bracelet in the very late Roman Hoxne Hoard.Webster, 52-53  In the Quoit Brooch Style the very varied motifs are largely geometrical but include human face-masks and processions or confronted pairs of schematic animals.Suzuki, S.(2000)Webster, 52  In most pieces the motifs are tightly packed together in a way lacking classical harmony, but comparable to later Anglo-Saxon work.

Both indigenous British deities and introduced Roman counterparts were venerated in the region, sometimes syncretising together, as in cases like Apollo-Cunomaglus and Sulis-Minerva. Romano-British temples were sometimes erected at locations that had earlier been cultic sites in pre-Roman Iron Age Britain. A new style of \"Romano-Celtic temple\" developed which was influenced by both Iron Age and imperial Roman architectural styles but also unique from both; buildings in this style remained in use until the 4th century. The cults of various eastern deities had also been introduced to Roman Britain, among them those of the deities Isis, Mithras, and Cybele; Christianity was just one of these eastern cults. The archaeologist Martin Henig suggested that to \"sense something of the spiritual environment of Christianity at this time\", it would be useful to imagine India, where Hinduism, \"a major polytheistic system\", remains dominant, and \"where churches containing images of Christ and the Virgin are in a tiny minority against the many temples of gods and goddesses\"."]}, {"page": "Christianity in Roman Britain", "response": ["The archaeologist Martin Henig suggested that to \"sense something of the spiritual environment of Christianity at this time\", it would be useful to imagine India, where Hinduism, \"a major polytheistic system\", remains dominant, and \"where churches containing images of Christ and the Virgin are in a tiny minority against the many temples of gods and goddesses\"."]}, {"page": "Dimitris Plantzos", "response": ["Dimitris Plantzos has published articles on a wide variety of topics, including the study of Greek gems and seal-impressions, Greek painting, nationalist uses of classical antiquity in contemporary Greece, archaeology in literature and cinema, and the use of archaeology as a biopolitical instrument in modern societies.
