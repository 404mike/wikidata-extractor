Throughout his service life and during retirement, Lynes was a noted and experienced ornithologist who contributed to numerous books on the subject and was in his lifetime considered the leading expert on African birds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of ornithologists", "response": ["*Hubert Lynes \u2013 Wales/England"]}, {"page": "HMS Warspite (03)", "response": ["Upon the completion of her repairs, Warspite rejoined the 5th Battle Squadron. Further misfortune struck soon afterwards, when she collided with Valiant after a night-shooting exercise, necessitating more repair work at Rosyth. Captain Philpotts avoided reprimand on this occasion, but was moved to a shore-based job as Naval Assistant to the new First Sea Lord, Admiral Jellicoe.Ballantyne, 2013, pp.\u00a065\u201366. He was replaced by Captain de Bartolome in December 1916.Watton, 1996, p.\u00a08. In June 1917, Warspite collided with a destroyer, but did not require major repairs. Early in April 1918 she joined the Grand Fleet in a fruitless pursuit of the German High Seas Fleet which had been hunting for a convoy near Norway. In 1918, Warspite had to spend four months being repaired after a boiler room caught fire.Ballantyne, 2013, p.\u00a067. Captain Hubert Lynes relieved Captain de Bartolome and on 21 November he took Warspite out to escort the German High Seas Fleet into internment at Scapa Flow following the signing of the Armistice."]}, {"page": "Hugh Whistler", "response": ["Whistler lived at Battle, East Sussex during his retirement, where he was a Justice of the Peace. He made one trip to India in 1928 as a guest of Admiral Hubert Lynes with the intention of studying the birds of Kashmir. Lynes was recalled to England and insisted that Whistler and Bertram Beresford Osmaston complete the bird survey. He joined the British Ornithologists' Union in 1913 and in 1940 served as its as vice-president. He visited Kashmir with Admiral Lynes and wanted to produce an account of the birds of Punjab and Kashmir; this was not completed."]}, {"page": "Reginald Ernest Moreau", "response": ["The Moreaus moved in March 1928 from the desert to the rainforests of the Usambara Mountains with their children David and Prinia. They often suffered from malaria and dysentery. Here, however he had access to a library and soon became librarian and also took up the editorial role of the East African Agricultural Journal. He did not have access to any books on the birds of the region until Admiral Hubert Lynes gave him a copy of Anton Reichenow's Vogel Afrikas. Still later Arthur Loveridge who employed a part-time native collector Salimu Asmani asked Moreau if Salimu could be employed. Salimu turned out to be a very good observer. The British Museum hardly had bird specimens from this region which was largely German controlled. Through C.B. Williams' efforts, some funds were diverted to help employ Salimu, Charles Abdallah and other African assistants. Through these assistants, Moreau obtained notes on incubation, feeding and collected a mass of data on bird nesting. In 1931 a species of bird that he collected was named after him by W.L. Sclater as Artisornis moreaui. In 1938 Moreau discovered another species of warbler which he named after his wife, initially as another species of Artisornis but later as Scepomycter winifredae. The Moreau's were also among the first Europeans to note the joking relationships or the utani system that connected tribes in East Africa. In 1934 the station was visited by David Lack and in 1939 by W. H. Thorpe and his wife. Thorpe had made the trip to find a giant coccid.  In 1936 they moved the children to England for their education, they only saw them again during their next leave in 1939 and then did not see them again until they returned to England after the war. In June 1946 Moreau developed choroiditis which threatened his eyesight. This led to his leaving Africa and retiring to England. He published nearly 80 papers while at Amani but still had work to be done. David Lack offered him a part-time position at the Edward Grey Institute while Thorpe offered him a place in his Cambridge section of Animal Behaviour. He also was invited to the editorship of the ornithological journal, Ibis. He received an honorary Master of Arts degree from the University of Oxford on 15 December 1951. He retired from the editorship of Ibis in 1960 and from the Edward Grey Institute in July 1964. The British Ornithologists' Union awarded him the Godman-Salvin award at their Annual General Meeting on 3 April 1966."]}, {"page": "Stubbington House School", "response": ["*Hubert Lynes CB, CMG, Rear Admiral and a noted ornithologist who was a Fellow of several learned societies "]}, {"page": "First Ostend Raid", "response": ["The \"Allied Naval and Marine Forces\" was a newly formed department created with the purpose of conducting raids and operations along the coastline of German-held territory. The organisation was able to command extensive resources from both the Royal and French navies and was commanded by Admiral Roger Keyes and his deputy, Commodore Hubert Lynes. Keyes, Lynes and their staff began planning methods of neutralising Bruges in late 1917 and by April 1918 were ready to put their plans into operation."]}, {"page": "Second Ostend Raid", "response": ["As British forces on the southeast coast of Britain regrouped, remanned and repaired following heavy losses at Zeebrugge, Keyes planned a return to Ostend with the intention of blocking the canal and consequently severing Bruges from the sea, closing the harbour and trapping the 18\u00a0U-boats and 25\u00a0destroyers present for months to come. Volunteers from among the force that had failed in April aided the planning with advice based on their experience on the previous operation. Among these volunteers were Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy of , Commander Alfred Godsal, former captain of , and Brilliants first lieutenant Victor Crutchley. These officers approached Commodore Hubert Lynes and Admiral Roger Keyes with a refined plan for a second attempt to block the port.Snelling, p. 249 Other officers came forward to participate and Keyes and Lynes devised an operational plan to attack the canal mouth at Ostend once again."]}, {"page": "Jack Vincent", "response": ["Vincent was born in London. At age 21 he moved to South Africa where he worked on two farms in the Richmond district of the Natal Province. In the 1920s he went back to England where he became a bird collector for the British Museum in London. From the late 1920s to the early 1930s he accompanied Admiral Hubert Lynes on several ornithological expeditions to East Africa, Central Africa and Southern Africa. Most memorable was his travel to the Mount Namuli massif in Mozambique in 1932 where he discovered some bird taxa new to science including the Namuli apalis (Apalis lynesi) and the dapple-throat (Arcanator  orostruthus). In 1934 he married the Scottish girl Mary Russell in Cape Town. In 1937 Vincent bought a farm in the Mooi River district of Natal."]}, {"page": "Mount Namuli", "response": ["Mount Namuli was first explored in August 1886 by Henry Edward O'Neill who was the British consul in Mozambique in 1879. It became notable in ornithological circles for the expedition by Hubert Lynes and Jack Vincent in 1931/1932. Due to the Mozambican Civil War and poor road access, it was not until 1998 when a South African team of ornithologists were able to explore the forests of Mount Namuli."]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (H)", "response": ["# Hubert Lynes"]}, {"page": "Harwich Force", "response": ["**  (Captain Hubert Lynes; undergoing repairs)"]}, {"page": "Lynes's cisticola", "response": ["Lynes's cisticola is sometimes considered as a subspecies species of the wailing cisticola (Cisticola lais).
