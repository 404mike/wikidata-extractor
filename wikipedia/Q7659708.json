He played twice for The Rams during the 1919\u201320 season, before moving to play for Bristol Rovers in their first two seasons in the Football League. He was the first player to score four goals in a League game for the Bristol side, and scored a total of 36 goals from 70 games for them. In spite of this impressive goal return he was unable to find another Football League club to play for when he returned home to Derbyshire in 1922 due to being unable to settle in the West Country.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Leigh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Syd Leigh"]}, {"page": "Leigh (name)", "response": ["* Syd Leigh (1893\u2013?), English professional footballer who played during the inter-war period"]}, {"page": "Alfred Sydney Leigh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Syd Leigh"]}, {"page": "Alfred S.
