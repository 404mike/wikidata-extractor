Despite this, a quantity of apparently Romano-British pottery has been unearthed on the site, as has a Roman-style drawstring leather purse containing ten low denomination Roman coins dating between the reigns of Tetricus I (270\u2013272) and Constantius II (337\u2013361). This suggests that \"at face-value ... either the Island or the landward area of the later Castle (or both...) formed the scene of third-fourth century habitation\" even if no evidence has been found of any buildings dating from this period.Thomas 1993. pp. 84-85. Thomas also noted that some of the post-Roman finds in the excavations of 1933-38 were close to the wall known as the Iron Gate which guards access to the plateau from the adjacent cove. He suggests that the vessels bringing such goods might have come to unload at this cove rather than on the dangerous beach of Tintagel Haven.Thomas (1993), p. 43", "Archaeologists no longer accept this viewpoint, however. Instead, they now believe that this was an elite settlement in the early medieval period that was inhabited by Dumnonian royalty and their entourage. Archaeologist and historian Charles Thomas believed that they did not stay at Tintagel year-round but that they moved around: \"A typical king with his family, relatives, dependants, resident hostages, officials and court-followers, and a private militia or war-band\u2014in all, probably between a hundred and three hundred souls at least\u2014moved around with his cumbersome entourage; at least, when not busy with inter-tribal campaigning or in repelling invaders and raiders.\" The site was also made more defensible during this period with a large ditch at the entrance to the peninsula, leaving only a narrow trackway that had to be traversed by anyone approaching the peninsula.Thomas 1993. pp. 58-59.", "Various luxury items dating from this period have been found at the site, namely African and Phocaean red slip, which had been traded all the way from the Mediterranean.Thomas 1993. p. 62. Examining this pottery, Charles Thomas remarked that \"the quantity of imported pottery from Tintagel [was]... dramatically greater than that from any other single site dated to about 450\u2013600 in either Britain or Ireland\". Carrying on from this, he noted that the quantity of imported pottery from Tintagel was \"larger than the combined total of all such pottery from all known sites [of this period in Britain and Ireland]; and, given that only about 5 per cent of the Island's accessible surface has been excavated or examined, the original total of imports may well have been on a scale of one or more complete shiploads, with individual ships perhaps carrying a cargo of six or seven hundred amphorae.\"Thomas 1993. p. 71. This evidence led him to believe that Tintagel was a site where ships docked to deposit their cargo from southern Europe in the early medieval period.", "However, many continue to argue against these legends. For example, archaeologist C.A. Ralegh Radford refused to believe in the legend and all of the associations, declaring in 1935 that \"no concrete evidence whatsoever has yet been found to support the legendary connection of the Castle with King Arthur\".Radford, quoted in Thomas 1993. p. 49. Charles Thomas, a specialist in Cornish history, was unable to find solid links, mainly because legends and stories would have been handed down only orally during this period. Thomas stated in 1993 that \"there simply is no independently attested connection in early Cornish folklore locating Arthur, at any age or in any capacity, at Tintagel.\"Thomas 1993. p. 28. Many others disagree, maintaining that the legendary figure would essentially have been an Early Medieval British leader, involved in fighting the migrating Anglo-Saxons who were settling in Britain at that time. The Artognou stone was found at Tintagel bearing the inscription PATERN[--] COLI AVI FICIT ARTOGNOU , and it has been claimed by some to provide evidence for a historical Arthur, but most historians reject this view.Michael Wood, In Search of England: Journeys Into the English Past, University of California Press, 2001, p. 23"]}, {"page": "Penzance", "response": ["\u2033The ancient chapel belonging to the town of Penzance may be seen in a fish cellar, near the key; it is small and as I remember had the image of the Virgin Mary in it.\u2033Borlase, William (1750) \"MS Parochial Memoranda (BM Egerton MSS 2657) (copy at RIC)\".

Bede accepted the identification as fact and dates St Alban's martyrdom to this later period.  As Morris points out, Diocletian reigned only in the East and would not have been involved in British affairs in 304; Emperor Severus, however, was in Britain from 208 to 211. Morris thus dates Alban's death to 209..
