He was a member of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Curator of the Manchester Museum and Professor of Geology at Owens College, Manchester. He is noted for his research on fossils and the antiquity of man. He was involved in many projects including a tunnel under the Humber, a Channel Tunnel attempt and the proving of coal under Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wookey Hole Caves", "response": ["Archaeological investigations were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, who moved to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey.

His work led to the discovery of the first evidence for the use by Paleolithic humans in the caves of the Mendip Hills.

Kollmann, of Basel, in his Pygmden in Europa (1894), argues for the existence of a European pygmy race in Neolithic times A notable proponent of the theory who had read MacRitchie's earlier works published in the Celtic Review was Grant Allen, who became convinced that fairies were modelled on an indigenous population of Britain, specifically the Neolithic long barrow makers.Macculloch, 1932, p. 362.\"Who were the Fairies\", Cornhill Magazine, 1881, xliii. 338f. The archaeologist William Boyd Dawkins found MacRitchie's views also appealing, since in his Early Man in Britain and His Place in the Tertiary Period (1880) he considered Upper Paleolithic culture across Europe (including Britain) to have been founded by a proto-Eskimo or Lapp race, a view at the time which was popularised after the discovery of \"Chancelade Man\", in southwestern France by Leo Testut in 1889.\"The Arrival of Man in Britain in the Pleistocene Age\", W. Boyd Dawkins, The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 40, Jul. \u2013 Dec. 1910, pp. 233\u2013263.Recherches anthropologiques sur le Squelette quaternaire de Chancelade, Bull. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Lyon, 1889. Scientific consensus after the 1930s, however, agreed that the remains of \"Chancelade Man\" were Cro-Magnon. Within folklore, MacRitchie's euhemeristic view of fairies developed a racialist school which considered that the fairies and other beings such as elves and goblins of British myth represented primitive pre-Aryans, a view proposed most notably by John S. Stuart Glennie, Laurence Waddell and Alfred Cort Haddon.Phoenician Origin of the Britons, Scots, and Anglo-Saxons (1924, 2nd ed. 1925), in this work Waddell cites MacRitchie.Silver, 1986, p. 150.Folk Memory Or the Continuity of British Archaeology by Walter Johnson (1908) is another work in this vein. According to Haddon: \"fairy tales were stories told by men of the Iron Age of events which happened to men of the Bronze Age in their conflicts with men of the Neolithic Age\".Quoted in \"Fairies in nineteenth-century art and literature\", Nicola Bown, Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 166. In both Haddon's and Waddell's view, the fairies or other beings of British folklore were based on the Neolithic inhabitants of Britain."]}, {"page": "Dawkins", "response": ["* William Boyd Dawkins (1837\u20131929), British geologist and archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Manchester Museum", "response": ["Ancient Worlds opened in October 2012 and transformed the main galleries of the 1912 building.

The issue of distinctiveness was seen as important as more information on the form of Iguanodon was in demand, and the cranial anatomy in particular was of importance. If the Cowleaze Chine material was a distinct genus, it ceased being useful in this respect. William Boyd Dawkins saw the differences in the two genera (in particular focusing on a differing number of digits) as being as significant as those between Equus and Hipparion,  which is to say that they were quite sufficient for distinction. Harry Seeley gave consideration to the differences in the skulls, and took Huxley's side. Fox, on the other hand, rejected Huxley's proposal of a distinct genus for his material, and subsequently took back his skull and gave it to Owen to study, along with some other fragments."]}, {"page": "Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man", "response": ["The book's three-part structure meant, however, that it was quickly supplanted by more detailed works that followed in its wake.
