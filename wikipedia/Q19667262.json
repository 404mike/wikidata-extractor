He was educated at Eton from 1781 to 1788 and at Harrow in 1789. He entered the Royal Navy and was commissioned a lieutenant on 12 June 1796. From May to August 1801, he commanded the brig-sloop Charger.King's family was one of several with electoral interests in County Roscommon. In 1799, their rivals, the pro-Unionist Mahons, had used his brother Robert's anti-Union stance to obtain the Lord Lieutenant's backing against him and take the Roscommon seat in the Parliament of Ireland at a by-election for Lt.-Col. Thomas Mahon, eldest son of the family. After the Union, the administration wished to remain on good terms with the Kings; they declined to support Mahon, and Edward was returned at the 1802 election without a contest.He was promoted commander on 29 April 1802, and commanded the ship-sloop Argus from June 1803 until becoming post-captain on 8 May 1804. In 1805, he took command of the sixth-rate Ariadne. He had recently returned to Ariadne, on blockading duty off of Gravelines, when the Dutch flotilla joining the proposed invasion of England broke out of Dunkirk on 17 July 1805, making for Boulogne. Ariadne and her consorts drove three or four of the thirty-two gun-vessels ashore, but they were badly outgunned by the shore forts and the four prams accompanying the gun-vessels. The Ariadne's squadron was joined early in the morning of the 18th by the frigate Vestal, which had heard the firing, and they renewed the attack on the flotilla off Calais, without notable results.Early in 1806, King was appointed to command the frigate HMS Alexandria. His elder brothers put him forward again that year as a candidate for Roscommon, although he was away at sea escorting convoys. The Mahon interest had revived, and Lord Hartland put up his second son, Col. Stephen Mahon, as a candidate. Mahon's interest proved too strong, and King withdrew from the contest without a poll. King died on 25 September 1807 at a naval hospital in St Ann's, Barbados, and was buried at St Michael's.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward King", "response": ["Edward King may refer to:", "* Edward King, 1st Earl of Kingston (1726\u20131797), Anglo-Irish politician and peer", "* Edward King (Irish politician), MP for Carrick, 1781\u20131793", "* Edward King (Ohio politician) (1795\u20131836), twice Speaker of the Ohio House and co-founder and on first faculty of Cincinnati Law School", "* Edward King (Parliamentarian) (1606\u20131681), English lawyer and politician", "* Edward King (rower) (born 1989), American rower", "* Edward King (British poet) (1612\u20131637)", "* Edward King (antiquarian) (1735?\u20131807), English barrister and writer", "* Edward King (author) (1848\u20131896), American journalist and author", "* Edward King (Royal Navy officer) (1774\u20131807), captain during the Napoleonic Wars", "* Edward King (bishop of Elphin) (died 1639), Anglican bishop in Ireland", "* Edward King (bishop of Lincoln) (1829\u20131910), Anglican bishop in England", "* Edward King (priest) (1920\u20131998), Anglican clergyman", "* Edward King (jurist) (1794\u20131873), jurist twice nominated to the United States Supreme Court", "* Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough (1795\u20131837), Irish antiquarian", "* Edward King (New York banker) (1833\u20131908), American banker"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Edward King (1774\u20131807), MP for Roscommon (1802\u20131806) and navy commander"]}, {"page": "Roscommon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Edward King"]}, {"page": "Members of the 2nd UK Parliament from Ireland", "response": ["| Hon.

Arriving at the latitude of Gravelines he discovered a fleet of 15 British shipsJames says that it was only  (20) under Capt. Edward King with six to eight smaller vessels; James, op.cit. 1837, p. 309 that attacked him, and forced several gunboats to beach themselves (though some of those managed to regain the flotilla later on). The British force broke off the fight at nightfall and Verhuell decided to anchor in the roadstead of Calais. During the night his chief-of-staff captain A.A. Buyskes, back in Dunkirk, sent off more gun schooners, which joined Verhuells flotilla without being molested, in the morning of 18 July. The British with 19 ships (among which two ships of the lineJames gives the following order of battle for the British:  (50) under Capt. George Argles,  (28) under Capt. Stephen Thomas Digby, with three sloops, and the squadron with HMS Trusty already mentioned; James, op.cit. 1837, p. 310) again engaged the flotilla in a long-range gun duel, that however did little damage to the Batavian ships. The French shore batteries also took part in the duel. The combined fire of the Dutch schooners and French heavy artillery forced the British fleet to break off the fight after two hours. The flotilla suffered the loss of 11 gunboats, that had to enter the harbour of Calais. His flotilla thus reduced to 21 gun schooners, Verhuell decided to round Cap Gris-Nez, well aware that the British were waiting for him. Much against his better judgment, the French Marshal Davout joined him aboard the schooner Heemskerk, and around 3 PM Verhuell weighed anchor to proceed toward the Cape. He was now faced by a British squadron of two ships of the line, six frigates and thirteen brigs that neared him to often only the distance of a pistol shot. Two brigs attempted to board Heemskerk, but were repelled. The Batavian ships were from the shore supported by Davout's horse artillery, and the British ships mostly over-shot the low-lying Dutch vessels, so that the damage remained limited. Finally, Verhuell's flotilla managed to round the Cape, after which the British attack abated, though they followed the flotilla till it had safely reached Ambleteuse around 7 PM. The British then made a final attempt to sink the Dutch flotilla, lying at anchor below the shore batteries, by gunfire, but were driven off by the French heavy guns after an hour.de Jonge, pp.566-575While Verhuell was underway to Ambleteuse, the French admiral, Lacrosse, launched a diversionary action with ships from the Boulogne flotilla. These were met by a squadron with HMS Immortalit\u00e9 under Capt. Edward Owen,   and . This separate action often gets convoluted with the one involving the Batavian flotilla in the stories of these individual ships, because the British ships later joined the squadron with HMS Vestal that made the final attempt at Ambleteuse.) escaped annihilation. James shows that these actions were actually separate in time and place; James, op.cit. 1837, p. 311.  Verhuell, not one to leave his exploits in the dark, wrote a glowing dispatch to the acting Secretary of State for the Navy, van Royen, on 22 July 1805, that was immediately published; French reports appeared in the Moniteur of 3 and 21 Thermidor, An XIII (22 July and 9 August 1805); de Jonge, p. 574, note 1"]}, {"page": "Robert King, 2nd Earl of Kingston", "response": ["He was the  eldest surviving son of Edward King, 1st Earl of Kingston and Jane Caulfeild.
