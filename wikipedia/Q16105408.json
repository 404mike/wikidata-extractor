He served as professor of systematic theology at the Free Church College from 1978 to 2011, and as principal from 1999 to 2010.\nIn 1996, Macleod was cleared of allegations that he had sexually assaulted four women. The Sheriff court found that \"the women had all lied in the witness box to further the ends of Professor Macleod's enemies in the Free Church of Scotland.\" A number of people who believed Macleod should be put on trial by the General Assembly then formed the Free Church Defence Association and ultimately a new denomination, the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing). However, Johnston McKay notes that although on the surface the split was about Donald Macleod, he believes it was about theology, since Macleod belonged to the more \"modernising\" wing of the Free Church.In 2011, a Festschrift was published in Macleod's honour.

Generations of British Muslims have done exactly that, many have made an invaluable contribution to British society, and many are perfectly prepared to listen quietly while Christians \u2018witness\u2019 to them.But when minorities become majorities, things change, as German Jews discovered in the 1930s.  Once the Nazis achieved ascendancy, friendly German neighbours suddenly became informants for the Gestapo; and in the event of Islamic dominance in Britain our friendly Muslim shopkeepers will have little option but to march behind the radicals.West Highland Free Press Editor Ian McCormack required Macleod to \u201cmoderate his language\u201d, MacLeod refused and resigned.

And the Logos became flesh and dwelt among us.\"John 1:1;14 NIV with Greek inserted.
