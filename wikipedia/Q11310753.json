Through the 1980s and early 1990s he was on at least one album in the UK Charts continuously, without a break, for over 13 years. In 2009 he had two consecutive UK No.1 singles with Pixie Lott and was the first person to be inducted into the Musician's Union \"Hall of Fame.\" In 2020 he scored his 25th No.1 playing on BTS's \"Dynamite\".\nHe is also known for playing with Level 42 in partnership with fellow Brit and saxophonist Gary Barnacle.\nHis other credits include work with artists such as Rod Stewart, George Michael, Lisa Stansfield, Jamiroquai, UB40, Cher, Tina Turner, Pet Shop Boys, Swing Out Sister, Spice Girls, BTS and many more, along with stints in the Buddy Rich Band and Gil Evans Orchestra.

According to Stephenson, the material they were given was \"very, very young pop\", and none were later used by the Spice Girls. During these first months, the group worked on demos at South Hill Park Recording Studios in Bracknell with producer and studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter and arranger Tim Hawes. They were also tasked with choreographing their own dance routines, which they worked on at Trinity Studios in Knaphill, near Woking, Surrey. A few months into the training, Stephenson was fired for a perceived lack of commitment. Heart Management turned to the group's vocal coach, Pepi Lemer, to find a replacement. After Lemer's first recommendation declined the offer, Lemer recommended her former pupil, Emma Bunton, who auditioned for the Herberts and joined as the fifth member."]}, {"page": "Level 42", "response": ["In December 1990, Level 42 returned to play a record run of concerts at Hammersmith Odeon, London, in part fulfilling booking obligations preceding the band's recent hiatus.

The album blended real horns, synths (arranged subtly, to sound like strings), drums, and xylophones, scored by producer/arranger Richard Niles. The follow-up single to the effervescent \"Breakout\" was the brooding \"Surrender\", which featured a trumpet solo performed by John Thirkell. It rose to number seven on the UK charts in January 1987. The next single was the more serious and jazzy \"Twilight World\". This song was the subject of many remixes and was a dance club favourite worldwide. The final single, \"Fooled By a Smile\", returned to the upbeat pop orientation characteristic of \"Breakout\".", "Numerous changes were afoot by the time the fourth album, The Living Return, was released in September 1994. The replacement of producer Paul O'Duffy, after initial studio sessions with Ray Hayden, contributed to a looser, rawer feel to the songs that were often the results of studio jam sessions. Though Drewery and Connell still led Swing Out Sister, additional musicians, including former 52nd Street bassist Derick Johnson, Pa'lante percussionist Chris Manis, Jazz Defectors drummer Myke Wilson, and trumpet player John Thirkell, increased the group to ten members who replicated the live performances that had been captured on the Japan-only release Live at the Jazz Cafe.
