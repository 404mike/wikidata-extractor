They were essentially the same group who were to succeed in persuading the government to found the National Gallery in 1824, and whose gifts to it provided most of the early collection.  There was a total group of 125 Governors, Directors and Subscribers, paying sums between 100 guineas (56 of them, 35 at 50g., 11 at 10g.) down to one guinea annually. In 1805 the initial subscribers consisted of \"One duke, five marquesses, fourteen earls, two viscounts, nine lords, two bishops, four ladies, seven baronets, twenty-two members of parliament, five clergymen and above fifty private gentlemen, bankers and merchants\".Taylor, 222  The Institution had been discussed with the Royal Academy before it was established, and relations were friendly, at least initially, though later there were to be tensions.  The Prince Regent was Patron from the foundation, and loans from the Royal Collection continued throughout the life of the Institution.  In 1822 the hereditary nature of the Governors was eased out, as they were becoming far too numerous, and the bottom end of the Subscribership tightened up.For details of the complicated membership see Smith, who appears to quote original minutes; sources differ at various points on matters of detail."]}, {"page": "Angerstein Collection", "response": ["The Angerstein Collection comprises 38 paintings that were bought by the British government from the collection of John Julius Angerstein after his death in 1823.
