He was one of the five men who accompanied Shackleton on his epic crossing from Elephant Island to South Georgia and was one of only four of the crew of Endurance not to receive the Polar Medal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest Shackleton", "response": ["Shackleton chose five companions for the journey: Frank Worsley, Endurances captain, who would be responsible for navigation; Tom Crean, who had \"begged to go\"; two strong sailors in John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy, and finally the carpenter McNish. Shackleton had clashed with McNish during the time when the party was stranded on the ice, but, while he did not forgive the carpenter's earlier insubordination, Shackleton recognised his value for this particular job. Not only did Shackleton recognize their value for the job but also because he knew the potential risk they were to morale. This allowed for Shackleton to remain in control of the morale of his crew members. The attitudes of his men were a point of emphasis in leading his men back to safety."]}, {"page": "Elephant Island", "response": ["Realizing that there was no chance of passive rescue, Shackleton decided to sail to South Georgia, where he knew there were several whaling stations. Shackleton sailed with Tom Crean, Frank Worsley, Harry \"Chippy\" McNish, Tim McCarthy, and John Vincent on an  voyage in the open lifeboat James Caird beginning on Easter Monday, April 24, 1916, and arriving at South Georgia 16 days later. His second-in-command, Frank Wild, was left in charge of the remaining party on Elephant Island, waiting for Shackleton's return with a rescue ship."]}, {"page": "Voyage of the James Caird", "response": ["For the remaining places Shackleton requested volunteers, and of the many who came forward he chose two strong sailors in John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy. He offered the final place to the carpenter, McNish. \"He was over fifty years of age\", wrote Shackleton of McNish (he was in fact 41), \"but he had a good knowledge of sailing boats and was very quick\". Vincent and McNish had each proved their worth during the difficult boat journey from the ice to Elephant Island. They were both somewhat awkward characters, and their selection may have reflected Shackleton's wish to keep potential troublemakers under his personal charge rather than leaving them on the island where personal animosities could fester."]}, {"page": "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["Shackleton selected the boat party: himself, Worsley, Crean, McNish, and sailors John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy. On instructions from Shackleton, McNish immediately set about adapting the James Caird, improvising tools and materials.Shackleton 1919, pp.\u00a0158\u2013159.Alexander 1998, pp.\u00a0134\u2013135. Wild was to be left in charge of the Elephant Island party, with instructions to make for Deception Island the following spring should Shackleton not return. Shackleton took supplies for only four weeks, judging that if land had not been reached within that time the boat would be lost.Alexander 1998, pp.\u00a0136\u2013137.", "Despite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the James Caird voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were John Vincent, William Stephenson and Ernest Holness.Huntford 1975, p.\u00a0656. Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service. Before the war ended, two\u2014Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham\u2014had been killed in action, and Ernest Wild, Frank's younger brother and member of the Ross Sea party, had died of typhoid while serving in the Mediterranean. Several others were severely wounded, and many received decorations for gallantry.Shackleton 1919, pp.\u00a0339\u2013341. Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires, Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in Murmansk, with the army rank of major.Fisher 1957, p.\u00a0432. This occupied him until March 1919. He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition, the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition on , which left London on 17\u00a0September 1921. From the Endurance crew, Wild, Worsley, Macklin, McIlroy, Hussey, Alexander Kerr, Thomas McLeod and cook Charles Green all sailed with Quest.Smith 2015, pp.\u00a0402\u2013407."]}, {"page": "Endurance (1912 ship)", "response": ["* John Vincent, Boatswain"]}, {"page": "Frank Worsley", "response": ["Shortly after the start of the voyage, the James Caird, which, in addition to Shackleton and Worsley, also carried McNish, sailors John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy, as well as the experienced Tom Crean, encountered the ice but Worsley found a way through and into the open ocean. The crew set up two watches for the journey, which eventually would take 16 days, in strong and heavy seas, to reach South Georgia. For most of the voyage, the weather proved to be stormy and so overcast Worsley was unable to take more than a few sightings with his sextant. He described one sighting as \"...cuddling the mast with one arm and swinging fore and aft round the mast, sextant and all...\" and he would \"...catch the sun when the boat leaped her highest on the crest of a sea...\". At times the sea conditions were so rough he was braced by the other crew members when taking his sightings. On occasion, the temperature was bitter and each man would spend one-minute shifts chipping away ice that coated the top surfaces of the James Caird, affecting its buoyancy. The heavy seas meant there was considerable risk that a man could go overboard."]}, {"page": "John Vincent", "response": ["John Vincent may refer to:", "*John Vincent (MP), Member of Parliament for Chichester and Midhurst", "*M.

Clark travelled in the 22\u00bd-foot James Caird with Shackleton, Frank Hurley, Leonard Hussey, Reginald James, James Wordie, Harry McNish, Charles Green, John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy. On arriving at the island, Shackleton set out almost immediately with five of the crew to fetch rescue from South Georgia. The rest of the men, Clark among them, stayed camped on the island with Frank Wild in command. Elephant Island was inhospitable. It was cold but humid which meant that neither the clothing nor the sleeping bags were ever completely dry. Though there were penguins and seals to eat, the supplies were not inexhaustible and fuel was scarce. The routine on the island was monotonous. Clark managed to produce a primitive alcoholic beverage from methylated spirit, sugar, water and ginger which became known as \"Gut Rot 1916\" and was drunk with a toast to \"Wives and Sweethearts\" on Saturdays. On 30 August 1916, the men on Elephant Island were rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship Yelcho, four months after he had left the island."]}]}}
