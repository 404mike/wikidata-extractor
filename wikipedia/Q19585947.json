Born to his family's lore in Islay in the Scottish Highlands, Livingston was a hyper patriotic Gaelic author of epic poetry. An autodidact, he was a tailor by trade, yet he taught himself the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French and Welsh languages and during his travels through the Scottish lowlands, collected an extensive knowledge of the Scottish nation's topography, place-names and folklore, eventually, settling in the west central lowlands' Glasgow. It is also said by Koch that William Livingston presented in his poetry \u201ca stark view of an Islay in which the human world has been all but banished from the natural landscape.\u201d Examples of William Livingston's work may be viewed in the Golden Treasury of Scottish Poetry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Golden Treasury of Scottish Poetry", "response": ["Douglas Ainslie - Marion Angus - John Barbour - Patrick Birnie - Mark Alexander Boyd - Dugald Buchanan - George Buchanan - Robert Burns - Thomas Campbell - Helen B.

One particular piece, a Manx Gaelic song called Fin as Oshin, is the only example of  existing in Manx musical tradition.Broderick (2018) pp. 63, 73, 76; Broderick (1990) pp. 51\u201353. Surviving in several eighteenth-century manuscripts,Broderick (2018) pp. 63\u201366; \u00d3 Muircheartaigh (2016). Fin as Oshin tells a tale similar to other poems recounting the story of the burning of Finn's house.Broderick (2018) pp. 73\u201374, 80\u201381; Broderick (1990) pp. 53\u201354 n. 13, 54\u201358; Moore, AW (1891) pp. 10\u201312; Campbell (1872) pp. 175\u2013180. A central character in the song is a certain Gorree/Orree/Orree Beg, a hero who corresponds to Garadh/Garaidh in cognate tales. The spelling of this hero's name in Fin as Oshin suggests that he represents Godred himself, thereby giving the story a native slant.Broderick (2018) pp. 66\u201367, 74\u201375; \u00d3 Muircheartaigh (2016) pp. 104\u2013105, 121; Broderick (1990) pp. 53, 53\u201354 n. 13. Godred's place in this song probably accounts for its survival in local memory.Broderick (2018) pp. 75\u201376. In Vindication of the Celtic Character, the nineteenth-century Gaelic poet William Livingstone offered imaginative accounts of Viking incursions on Islay. One such tale, alleged by Livingstone to have been \"handed down from the Danish mythologists of those days\", concerns exploits of Godred in the island's Loch Indaal vicinity. Livingstone's versions of such local traditions appear to be the inspiration behind his epic Gaelic battle-poem Na Lochlannaich an Ile (\"The Norsemen in Islay\").Kidd (2006); Whyte (1991) pp. 175\u2013176; Livingston (1882) pp. 1\u201337; Livingston (1850) pp. 147\u2013150. The Gaelic folk song Birlinn Ghoraidh Chr\u00f3bhain, sometimes called Birlinn Ghoraidh Chrobhain and Godred Crovan's Galley, was composed by Duncan Johnston, and released in part one of his 1938 book Cronan nan Tonn. Johnston's song describes the journey of Godred's royal birlinn from Mann to Islay, and commemorates the sea-power of the Crovan dynasty.McDonald (2007b) p. 53, 53 n. 62; Johnston (1997) p. 28."]}, {"page": "1808 in poetry", "response": ["* c.
