He soon appointed new signing Craig Easton, who he had previously managed at Swindon Town, as captain while another player from one of Sturrock's old clubs, Chris Barker, was later appointed as vice-captain, having initially been signed on loan, and then permanently on deadline day. It was not an easy task for Sturrock as his assistant, Tommy Widdrington left for \"footballing reasons\" on Wednesday 15 December 2010. After a mid table finish in his first season, he enjoyed more success during the 2011\u201312 season where Southend led League Two for most of the campaign.

He was appointed team captain, and forged a reputation for hard work and consistency as the foundation of the Cardiff defence, forming an effective partnership with Glenn Loovens.

With that goal, he ended a 21-month-long goal drought, in which time he had played 83 matches without scoring. He played his 150th game for the Shrimpers on 16 February 2013 when they took on Northampton Town, a game which the Blues lost 2\u20131. He earned the captains armband from Luke Prosser who had been deputising for injured club captain Chris Barker on 2 March 2013. He then scored two goals in two games, the first in a 2\u20131 win against Port Vale on 9 March, and the second in a 3\u20131 loss to Wimbledon three days later. Clohessy also helped Southend to the 2013 Football League Trophy Final, where Southend took on Crewe at Wembley Stadium on 7 April 2013.

Hall missed the opening match of the 2010\u201311 season against Stockport County due to an outstanding suspension after he picked up a red card playing for Bromley in the last game of the previous season. Subsequently, he made his debut in a 3\u20132 home win over Bristol City in the League Cup first round on 10 August 2010. Hall scored his first goal for Southend, netting after just 32 seconds in a 2\u20131 away win over Rotherham United on 15 January 2011. He signed a two-year contract extension with the club on 14 April 2011, prior to being voted as runner-up for the Southend Player of the Year award, behind Chris Barker.
