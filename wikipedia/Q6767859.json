Derry City Council afterward began this process, and was involved in conducting an equality impact assessment report (EQIA).Equality Impact Assessments Derry City Council website  Firstly it held an opinion poll of district residents in 2009, which reported that 75% of Catholics and 77% of Nationalists found the proposed change acceptable, compared to 6% of Protestants and 8% of Unionists.Draft EQIA, Appendix pp.91\u20132 The EQIA then held two consultative forums, and solicited comments from the general public on whether or not the city should have its name changed to Derry.

Rival change.org petitions for and against the proposal were started. In October and November in the House of Lords, minister Lord Dunlop gave two answers on the matter to unionist Lord Laird, who claimed any name change would require cross-community consensus under the Good Friday Agreement. The first stated \"The Government, on occasion receives requests to change names of towns and cities. At this time the Government does not intend to change the name of the City of Londonderry.\" The second said it would \"only do so with consensus\".
