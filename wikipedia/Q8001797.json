However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the recordings for the band's second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, who Wood felt failed in his role, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where the cellos and violins could not be heard over the electric instruments. However, Arden would manage Wizzard, despite Wood's negative comments towards Arden. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, who had been the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello, respectively."]}, {"page": "Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week!", "response": ["* Violin (track 13) \u2013 Barry Wilde, Ben Cruft, Bill Benham, David Woodcock, Elizabeth Edwards, Mark Berrow, Peter Oxer, Roger Garland, Wilfred Gibson"]}, {"page": "Homogenic", "response": ["** Vaughan Armon, Sigurbjorn Bernhardsson, Mark Berrow, Ben Cruft, Sigrun Edvaldsdottir, Roger Garland, Wilfred Gibson, Perry Mason, Jim McLeod, Perry Montague-Mason, Peter Oxer, Maciej Rakowski, Una Sveinbjarnardottir, Sif Tulinius, Gavyn Wright \u2013 violins"]}, {"page": "On the Third Day", "response": ["On the Third Day was released in 1973 and failed to enter the UK charts at the time, although it did reach the US charts at number 52.
