While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as critical psychology or liberation psychology, which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Likewise, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context.Lynne Layton, Nancy Caro Hollander, Susan Gutwill (Eds) (2006) Psychoanalysis, class and politics: encounters in the clinical setting Introduction; Pg 47 Slavoj Zizek (drawing on Herbert Marcuse, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to \"enjoy!\" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994)."]}, {"page": "Discourse Unit", "response": ["The Discourse Unit is an international research group that currently has its main base at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. It has been one of the most important focal points for the development of critical work in psychology and in other social sciences concerned with questions of subjectivity and politics. The term \"discourse\" is used as a cover-all term for political studies of individual subjectivity that draw on feminism, Marxism, post-structuralism and psychoanalysis. In 2003, Ian Parker produced a document for the Discourse Unit that outlines the way that researchers in the group draw on these four theoretical resources.

This collaborative research and writing has continued in recent years in publications on suicide and self-harm and on domestic violence and \"minoritisation\", in which her concerns with the position of women and children connect with asylum and immigration issues.

In his 1997 book Psychoanalytic Culture, Parker defines the 'discursive complex' as a 'methodological device. The term 'complex' is used quite deliberately to evoke the peculiarly Freudian and post-Freudian nature of the subjectivity people in the West live so much of the time. On the one hand the concepts that psychoanalytic texts employ are relayed through culture as components of a discourse, as objects that are circumscribed by definitions in academic and professional writing and used in advertising (Parker, 1995). In this sense, the discourse constitutes places for subjects to come to be, whether as a child with problems separating from the mother, as a teenager filled with frustration and resentment at authority, or as an older adult reflecting on an unfulfilled life and needs. The discourse thus positions the subject who is addressed by or who is employing the discourse to understand themselves or their troubling relationships. On the other hand, the discourse touches an already existing shape of subjectivity for those who write and speak about themselves and others, whether that is in the form of autobiography or in an advice column, in a television interview or on the couch with a therapist. It chimes with a theory of self that the subject has been invited to elaborate for themselves in this culture, and so it reconfigures each time some of the emotions that are available to them.", "In response to critical reviews of this work,Blackwell, D.

In those cases, Parker suggests that we would then need to speak of 'discursive repertoires' or 'discursive templates'. His main concern, he argues, is with the role of psychoanalysis in relation to psychology, and he adopts the argument made by Erica Burman that psychoanalysis is the 'repressed other' of psychology. In this way he hopes to make psychoanalysis be of relevance to critical psychology without simply replacing psychology with psychoanalysis."]}, {"page": "Annual Review of Critical Psychology", "response": ["The Annual Review of Critical Psychology is a peer-reviewed academic journal in the field of critical psychology.
