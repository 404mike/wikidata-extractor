For example, the perpetrators of the Christchurch massacre and the El Paso shooting appear to have been motivated by the conspiracy theory that white people are being replaced by non-whites largely as a result of feminist stances in Western societies. According to Helen Lewis, the far-right ideology considers it vital to control female reproduction and sexuality: \"Misogyny is used predominantly as the first outreach mechanism\", where \"You were owed something, or your life should have been X, but because of the ridiculous things feminists are doing, you can\u2019t access them.\" Similar strands of thought are found in the incel subculture, which centers around misogynist fantasies about punishing women for not having sex with them."]}, {"page": "Alun Cochrane", "response": ["In January 2020 he competed on the second episode of series 101 of the BBC Radio 4 series The News Quiz, alongside comedians Mark Steele and Lucy Porter, and Journalist Helen Lewis."]}, {"page": "Great Lives", "response": ["|Helen Lewis, journalist"]}, {"page": "Paul Dacre", "response": ["A shy man who is uneasy in company, according to former employee Helen Lewis, Dacre has a reputation for avoiding publicity and seldom gives interviews.

Elphicke described the campaign as shamefully political and an abuse of taxpayers' money. He also criticised directors' pay. Debating the issue in The Observer, Helen Lewis suggested the MPs' objectives were to stop charities criticising the government, whilst The Times said that guidelines had changed in the last decade, and some objectives previously deemed political were now accepted as charitable. The Charity Commission ruled that, although Oxfam's motives were not intentionally political, it could have done more to show its tweets related to its own report on food poverty. In February 2015 following a report by Third Sector magazine that 32 charity bosses received over \u00a3200,000 in 2014, Elphicke expressed concern that trust in charities would be undermined and that people would not donate if they thought their pay was excessive."]}, {"page": "St Mary's School, Worcester", "response": ["* Helen Lewis, deputy editor of the New Statesman"]}, {"page": "The Student Journals", "response": ["The Student Journals has launched several projects since its creation.
