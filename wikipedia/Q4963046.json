One aid relief worker stated that following the publicity generated by the concert, \"humanitarian concern is now at the centre of foreign policy\" for Western governments. Geldof has said, \"We took an issue that was nowhere on the political agenda and, through the lingua franca of the planet \u2013 which is not English but rock 'n' roll \u2013 we were able to address the intellectual absurdity and the moral repulsion of people dying of want in a world of surplus.\" In another interview he stated that Live Aid \"created something permanent and self-sustaining\" but also asked why Africa is getting poorer. The organisers of Live Aid tried to run aid efforts directly, channelling millions of pounds to NGOs in Ethiopia. It has been alleged that much of this went to the Ethiopian government of Mengistu Haile Mariam \u2013 a regime the UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed \u2013 and it is also alleged some funds were spent on guns. The BBC stated in 2010 there was no evidence money had been diverted, while the former British Ambassador to Ethiopia, Brian Barder, states, \"the diversion of aid related only to the tiny proportion that was supplied by some NGOs to rebel-held areas.\"", "According to the BBC World Service, a certain proportion of the funds were siphoned off to buy arms for the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front. This coalition battled at the time against Derg. The Band Aid Trust complained to the BBC Editorial Complaints Unit regarding the specific allegations in the BBC World Service documentary, and their complaint was upheld. In 2010 the BBC issued an apology to the Trust and stated there was no evidence money had been diverted, while the former British Ambassador to Ethiopia, Brian Barder, states, \"the diversion of aid related only to the tiny proportion that was supplied by some NGOs to rebel-held areas.\""]}, {"page": "Sherborne School", "response": ["Notable Old Shirburnians in diplomacy include Sir Alan Campbell, UK High Commissioner to Australia Sir Brian Barder, British High Commissioner in Malaya Sir Donald MacGillivray, colonial administrator Sir Hugh Norman-Walker, UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations Sir John Weston, UK Ambassador to Turkey and Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man Sir Timothy Daunt, ambassador to Thailand, Austria and Brazil Sir Geoffrey Arnold Wallinger, diplomat, philanthropist and explorer Hugh Carless, and Governor-General of New Zealand The Right Honourable Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe."]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Labour Club", "response": ["*Brian Barder, former diplomat."]}, {"page": "List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Nigeria", "response": ["*1988\u20131991: Brian BarderBARDER, Sir Brian (Leon), Who's Who 2013, A & C Black, 2013; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012, accessed 9 April 2013"]}, {"page": "List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Australia", "response": ["|Sir Brian Barder, ||1991||1994"]}, {"page": "1934 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Brian Barder, diplomat (died 2017)"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Poland", "response": ["*1986\u20131988: Sir Brian Barder "]}, {"page": "Streatham Park Cemetery", "response": ["*Brian Barder"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Ethiopia", "response": ["*1982\u20131986: Brian Barder"]}, {"page": "E-International Relations", "response": ["E-IR contains a mixture of open access books, articles, essays, and features, broadly aimed at students and scholars of international politics.
