Chief amongst these was the fact that the Emergency forced the All-Ireland minor and junior to be cancelled, resulting in the Ulster teams having no hurling competition. Because of this the Ulster champions were allowed to participate in the All-Ireland senior championship for the first time since 1925. That year Armstrong collected his second Ulster title before lining out against Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final. That game, played at Corrigan Park in Belfast, threw up a surprise result as Antrim defeated Galway by 7\u20130 to 6\u20132. This allowed Armstrong's side to advance to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Kilkenny and, once again, the game was played at Corrigan Park. It was another historic win for Antrim as 'the Cats' were defeated by 3\u20133 to 1\u20136. It was the biggest shock in the history of the All-Ireland championship. For the first time in history a team from Ulster qualified to play in the All-Ireland final. Cork, the champions of the previous two years, provided the opposition on this occasion. Before the game, the economic realities of the time surfaced. Jimmy Walsh, the Antrim captain presented a quantity of butter to the Cork captain, Se\u00e1n Condon, who in turn presented his counterpart with a quantity of tea. Once the pre-match festivities were over the game began and a rout ensued. Cork crushed Antrim by 5\u201316 to 0\u20134, one of the biggest deficits in the history of the championship."]}, {"page": "Antrim\u2013Cork hurling rivalry", "response": ["After two shock victories over Galway and Kilkenny, Antrim made history by becoming the first Ulster representatives to line out in an All-Ireland final against Cork on 5 September 1943. The harsh economic realities of the Emergency were recognised before the throw-in as team captains Mick Kennefick and Jimmy Walsh made an exchange of tea and butter. But that was as good as it got for Antrim, as they froze on a day when Cork caught fire. Cork led by 3-11 to 0-2 at the break and by 5-16 to 0-4 at the end. The Rebels had their second three-in-a-row."]}]}}
