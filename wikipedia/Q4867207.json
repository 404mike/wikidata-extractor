In 1951 Basil returned to The Kirchin Band, now renamed the Ivor and Basil Kirchin Band, which made its debut on 8 September with a year-long residency at the Edinburgh Fountainbridge Palais, followed in November 1953 by an engagement at the Belfast Plaza Ballroom that extended into the spring of 1954. At the same time, the group also backed singer Ruby Murray during a 13-week series for Radio Luxembourg.  They returned to London in 1954 for a summer residency and an appearance at the 1954 Jazz Jamboree. Unfortunately at this time a serious car accident sidelined Ivor, requiring Basil to take over band leadership and business management for the band, which he soon realized he enjoyed much less than the music.  With his father's return to health, the band took on a brassier, more spontaneous sound which proved immensely popular.  It was at this time that the band came to the attention of a young 28-year-old engineer for Parlophone Records named George Martin, who proceeded to launch a whole new recording career for the band. The band continued to enjoy success, with Billy Eckstein and Sarah Vaughan insisting that the Kirchin Band backed them when they toured Britain. Their shows would break attendance records and were featured in Melody Maker polls.\"A journey into the unheard\", The Times, 3 June 2003; Bob Stanley; p. 21. By 1955 the band was now recognised as a swing/jazz type band and they were on a Swing Session broadcast on the BBC Light Programme.

Their minimalist and abrasive 1992 debut Gash stood out from the grunge and shoegazing that dominated alternative music at the time, instead anticipating later developments like lo-fi and post-rock, and their musical palette broadened rapidly over subsequent releases to encompass jazz and hip-hop elements and unusual instrumentation including glockenspiels, toy pianos and a Hawaiian bubble machine. The best known exponents of the scene were Broadcast, who formed in 1995 and of all the Birmingham retrofuturist bands were the most directly influenced by 1960s psychedelia. Fronted by the ethereal vocals of Trish Keenan, Broadcast combined influences as varied as the library music of Basil Kirchin, the children's music of Carl Orff and the soundtracks of Czechoslovakian surrealist cinema, while continuing to produce identifiable pop songs. Although they largely eschewed mainstream commercial success, they acquired a large and international cult following and were cited as an influence by artists as diverse as Blur, Paul Weller and Danger Mouse."]}, {"page": "2005 in jazz", "response": ["** Basil Kirchin, English drummer and composer (born 1927)."]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 2005 in jazz, deaths of Al Casey, Al McKibbon, Albert Mangelsdorff, Alfredo Rodr\u00edguez, Andrew Bisset, Arnie Lawrence, Basil Kirchin, Benny Bailey, Bill DeArango, Bill Potts, Billy Amstell, Billy Bauer, Blue Barron, Bob Enevoldsen, Charlie Norman, Derek Bailey, Dianne Brooks, Dom Um Rom\u00e3o, Elmer Dresslar Jr., Earl Zindars, Francy Boland, Georges Arvanitas, Glenn Corneille, Harry Gold, Harry Pepl, Humphrey Carpenter, Jack Lesberg, Jimmy Smith, Jimmy Woode, John Stubblefield, Jos\u00e9 Melis, Keter Betts, Larry Bunker, Lucky Thompson, Mikkel Flagstad, Monica Zetterlund, Niels-Henning \u00d8rsted Pedersen, Oleg Lundstrem, Oscar Brown, Pam Bricker, Per Henrik Wallin, Percy Heath, Roy Brooks, Shirley Horn, Stan Levey, Ted Greene, Tom Talbert, and Victor Sproles.", "* 1927 in jazz, deaths of Florence Mills and Louis Cottrell, Sr.; births of Ahmed Abdul-Malik, Akira Miyazawa, Al Fairweather, Al Martino, Allen Eager, Andy McGhee, Anita Kerr, Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, Attila Zoller, Barbara Dane, Basil Kirchin, Benny Green, Bhumibol Adulyadej, Big Jay McNeely, Bill Crow, Bill Holman, Bill Le Sage, Billy Byers, Buck Hill, Bucky Calabrese, Buddy Banks, Charles Greenlee, Charlie Callas, Charlie Kennedy, Chris Connor, Chuck Stewart, Cleo Laine, Clora Bryant, Colette Bonheur, Connie Kay, Conte Candoli, Cy Touff, Danny Moss, Dick Hyman, Dick Noel, Dick Wellstood, Dick Wetmore, Doc Severinsen, Dolo Coker, Don Bagley, Don Fagerquist, Don Shirley, Donn Trenner, Earl Zindars, Eartha Kitt, Eddie Cano, Elvin Jones, Ernie Andrews, Fats Sadi, Frank Traynor, Gene Quill, George Freeman, George Tucker, Gerry Mulligan, Guy Lafitte, Hank Marr, Horst Lippmann, Ian Christie, Ike Cole, J.
