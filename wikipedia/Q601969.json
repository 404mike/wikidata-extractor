Druce named the tree for Dr Robert Plot, a 17th-century English naturalist. The older vernacular name 'Lock Elm', in use since at least 1742, is said to be an allusion to the difficulty in working its timber.Gurney, R. (1958). Trees of Britain. Faber & Faber, London. Druce, however, wrote in 1913 that 'The wood is of very good quality, easy to work, and of a different texture from the Wych, Dutch, or English Elm, and has a general usefulness as a substitute for Ash or Wych Elm. The name Locks Elm can have no reference to any difficulty in working or dressing of the wood.' 'Lock' may be related to its use in boundaries, as 'loc' is Old English for enclosure. Lock Elm may have been one of the plants used in witchcraft to open locks and reveal hidden treasure. Richens called the tree U. minor. var. lockii. A. R. Horwood in his book British Wild Flowers \u2013 In Their Natural Haunts, called it the 'Northamptonshire Elm'.
