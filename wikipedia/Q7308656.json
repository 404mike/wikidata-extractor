He studied at the prestigious Wellington College before going on to Keble College, Oxford. He qualified for the Indian Civil Service in 1882, and two years later was sent on his first posting to the Central Provinces.\nCraddock spent many years in the Central Provinces, moving steadily up the civil service ladder. He was an industrious worker and his diligence was duly recognized by the authorities. From 1893 onwards, he held the following positions in succession: Commissioner of Excise; head of the Nagpur District; Chief Secretary to the head of the Province; Commissioner of the Nagpur Division; and finally Chief Commissioner (or governor of the province) in 1907.\nAt the 1931 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament for  the Combined English Universities, and held the seat until his death in 1937.", "link_mentions": {}}}
