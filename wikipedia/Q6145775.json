He was born in Leith and studied at the University of Edinburgh, living most of his life in Edinburgh. His admiration for Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin may have contributed to his failure to secure a ministry. Instead he earned a living as a writer. He translated Auguste Barth's Religions of India and edited Nuttall's Standard Dictionary, The Nuttall Encyclopaedia, Warne's Dictionary of Quotations (later titled Nuttall's Dictionary of Quotations), Bagster & Sons' Helps to the Bible, and a Carlyle School Reader. In 1881 he published anonymously The Strait Gate, and Other Discourses, with a Lecture on Thomas Carlyle, by a Scotch Preacher. He is described by P. J. E. Wilson as \" that most conscientious of pedants\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Carlyle", "response": ["\"The Everlasting No\" is Carlyle's name for the spirit of unbelief in God, as embodied in the Mephistopheles of Goethe, which is forever denying the reality of the divine in the thoughts, the character, and the life of humanity, and has a malicious pleasure in scoffing at everything high and noble as hollow and void.\"Everlasting No, The.\" In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia, 1907.", "\"The Everlasting Yea\" is Carlyle's name in the book for the spirit of faith in God in an attitude of clear, resolute, steady, and uncompromising antagonism to the \"Everlasting No\", and the principle that there is no such thing as faith in God except in such antagonism to the spirit opposed to God.\"Everlasting Yea, The.\" In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia, 1907.", "Following Goethe's description of Christianity as the \"Worship of Sorrow\", and \"our highest religion, for the Son of Man\", Carlyle interprets this as \"there is no noble crown, well worn or even ill worn, but is a crown of thorns\".\"Sorrow, Worship of\" In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia, 1907.", "\"The \"Worship of Silence\" is Carlyle's name for the sacred respect for restraint in speech till \"thought has silently matured itself,\u00a0... to hold one's tongue till some meaning lie behind to set it wagging\", a doctrine which many misunderstand, almost wilfully, it would seem; silence being to him the very womb out of which all great things are born.\"\"Silence, Worship of\" In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia, 1907."]}, {"page": "John Stuart Blackie", "response": ["* On Self-Culture, Edmonston & Douglas, 1874 [particularly recommended by James Wood]."]}, {"page": "James Wood", "response": ["* James Wood (governor) (1741\u20131813), Governor of Virginia and officer in the American Revolutionary War", "* James Wood (New York politician) (1820\u20131892), New York politician and Union Army general", "* James Wood (Irish politician) (1865\u20131936), Member of Parliament for East Down, 1902\u20131906", "* James Wood (footballer) (1893\u2013?), professional footballer, who played for South Shields, Huddersfield Town and Blackpool", "* James Wood (South African cricketer) (born 1985), South African cricketer, played for Durham UCCE", "* James Wood (Lancashire cricketer) (1933\u20131977), English cricketer for Lancashire 1954\u201356", "* James Wood (New Zealand cricketer) (1854-1937), New Zealand cricketer", "* James Wood (mathematician) (1760\u20131839), Dean of Ely 1820\u20131839", "* James Wood (minister) (1672\u20131759), Presbyterian minister of Atherton and Chowbent Chapels in Atherton, Greater Manchester, England", "* James Wood (Canadian admiral) (born 1934), Canadian admiral", "* Sir James Wood, 2nd Baronet (died 1738), Scottish officer of the Dutch States Army and later the British Army", "* James Wood (Royal Navy officer), commander of HMS Pandora during its commission at the Royal Navy's Pacific Station", "* James Wood (musician) (born 1953), British composer and percussionist", "* James Wood (critic) (born 1965), British literary critic and novelist", "* James Wood (encyclopaedist) (1820\u20131901), British editor of The Nuttall Encyclopaedia", "* James Wood, Lord Irwin (born 1977), British courtesy peer", "* James Wood (engineer), American engineer", "* James Wood Bush (c. 1844\u20131906), Hawaiian-American Civil War combatant", "* James Wood (screenwriter), British screenwriter", "* James Woods (disambiguation)"]}]}}
