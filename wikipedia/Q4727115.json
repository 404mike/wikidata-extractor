Knowles was a founding member of the Fluxus movement, an international network of artists who aspired to merge different artistic media and disciplines. Criteria that have come to distinguish her work as an artist are the arena of performance, the indeterminacy of her event scores resulting in the deauthorization of the work, and the element of tactile participation. She graduated from Pratt Institute in New York with an honors degree in fine art. In May 2015, she was awarded an honorary doctorate degree by Pratt.", "In addition to her father, Knowles notes John Cage as another one of her mentors. She knew of Cage through one of his courses taught at the New School for Social Research in 1958. Many of the Fluxus leaders, such as Dick Higgins, George Brecht, Al Hansen and Allan Kaprow, took the historic class. Knowles's focus in painting diminished after her show at the Nonegon Gallery in New York, in which she destroyed all of her works in a bonfire behind her brother's house.Bloch, Mark. \"The Boat Book by Alison Knowles\" White Hot Magazine. http://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/boat-book-alison-knowles/3113. January 2014. This act of destruction led directly to her association with other types of work and eventually with Fluxus. On the first Fluxus tour in 1962, Knowles began to write event scores, which would quickly become a major aspect of the movement.Bloch, Mark \"What Did Raynaud and When Did He Know It? An Interview with Alison Knowles\"  Black Mountain College Studies Journal Vol. 8. http://www.blackmountainstudiesjournal.org/volume-8-special-surprise-issue-summer-2015/what-did-raynaud-and-when-did-he-know-it-interview-with-alison-knowles-by-mark-bloch/", "Knowles has been active in sound since the late 1960s. In 1969, Knowles designed and co-edited John Cage's Notations, a book of music manuscripts published by the Something Else Press. Her Bean Garden, first presented at the Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York, consists of a large amplified platform covered with beans. Most recently reconstructed for the Alison Knowles exhibition at the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Bean Garden invites visitors to walk through the platform, allowing the sounds of the beans to resonate with each step. Knowles has also created a series of sounded objects, including the bean turner (a handcrafted flax paper pouch filled with beans), wrist rubbers (flax paper \u201cgloves\u201d embedded with beans), and a bamboo and flax accordion. Knowles's interest in the sounds produced by beans was explored in a series of four radio programs hosted by the German station Westdeutscher Rundfunk, whose director was a friend and supporter of John Cage. In 1982, Knowles was awarded the prestigious Karl Sczuka Award for best radio work from WDR for her event score, Bean Sequences.", "Alison Knowles was married to Dick Higgins, a leading Fluxist who coined the term intermedia. She has two twin daughters, Jessica and Hannah Higgins. Jessica is a New York-based intermedia artist closely associated with seminal curator Lance Fung, late Fluxus gallerist Emily Harvey, and The International Artists' Museum's Construction in Process. Hannah Higgins is a writer, art historian, and professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Both daughters performed and collaborated in original Fluxus related events as youths. Knowles often does performance pieces with members of her family, including Loose Pages, Shoes Of Your Choice, and Beans All Day. Knowles lives and works from her loft in New York City's Soho district, where she was a homesteader beginning in the 1950s.", "* Alison Knowles", "*Alison Knowles at CMOA", "*Celebrating the Playful and Ephemeral Art of Alison Knowles", "*Her Ordinary Materials: Fluxus Artist Alison Knowles on Her Carnegie Museum Show", "*CMOA Exhibit Explores Long Career of Alison Knowles", "*Alison Knowles at James Fuentes"]}, {"page": "2007 World Rowing Championships", "response": ["|   Carla Ashford (b)Baz Moffat (2)Alice Freeman (3)Louisa Reeve (4)Natasha Howard (5)Alison Knowles (6)Catherine Greves (7)Jessica Eddie (s)Caroline O'Connor (c) || 6:19.66"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Carla Ashford Jess Eddie Katie Greves Natasha Howard* Alison Knowles* Caroline O'Connor (cox) Natasha Page Beth Rodford Sarah Winckless"]}, {"page": "2011 World Rowing Championships", "response": ["| Alison KnowlesJo CookJessica EddieLouisa ReeveNatasha PageLindsey MaguireKatie GrevesVictoria ThornleyCaroline O'Connor||  6:06.03"]}, {"page": "Louisa Reeve", "response": ["She was part of the British squad that topped the medal table at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, where she won a bronze medal as part of the eight with Alison Knowles, Jo Cook, Jessica Eddie, Natasha Page, Lindsey Maguire, Katie Greves, Victoria Thornley and Caroline O'Connor."]}, {"page": "Natasha Page", "response": ["She was part of the British squad that topped the medal table at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, where she won a bronze medal as part of the eight with Alison Knowles, Jo Cook, Jessica Eddie, Louisa Reeve, Lindsey Maguire, Katie Greves, Victoria Thornley and Caroline O'Connor."]}, {"page": "Jessica Eddie", "response": ["She was part of the British squad that topped the medal table at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, where she won a bronze medal as part of the eight with Alison Knowles, Jo Cook, Louisa Reeve, Natasha Page, Lindsey Maguire, Katie Greves, Victoria Thornley and Caroline O'Connor."]}, {"page": "Katie Greves", "response": ["She was part of the British squad that topped the medal table at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, where she won a bronze medal as part of the eight with Alison Knowles, Jo Cook, Jessica Eddie, Louisa Reeve, Natasha Page, Lindsey Maguire, Victoria Thornley and Caroline O'Connor."]}, {"page": "Caroline O'Connor (rowing)", "response": ["She was part of the British squad that topped the medal table at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, where she won a bronze medal as part of the eight with Alison Knowles, Jo Cook, Jessica Eddie, Louisa Reeve, Natasha Page, Lindsey Maguire, Katie Greves and Victoria Thornley."]}, {"page": "September 2011 in sports", "response": ["***Eights (W8+):   (Esther Lofgren, Susan Francia, Meghan Musnicki, Taylor Ritzel, Jamie Redman, Amanda Polk, Caroline Lind, Elle Logan, Mary Whipple) 6:03.65   (Janine Hanson, Rachelle Viinberg, Natalie Mastracci, Cristy Nurse, Krista Guloien, Ashley Brzozowicz, Darcy Marquardt, Andr\u00e9anne Morin, Lesley Thompson) 6:04.39   (Alison Knowles, Jo Cook, Jessica Eddie, Louisa Reeve, Natasha Page, Lindsey Maguire, Katie Solesbury, Victoria Thornley, Caroline O'Connor) 6:06.03"]}, {"page": "Lindsey Maguire", "response": ["She was part of the British squad that topped the medal table at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, where she won a bronze medal as part of the eight with Alison Knowles, Jo Cook, Jessica Eddie, Louisa Reeve, Natasha Page, Katie Greves, Victoria Thornley and Caroline O'Connor."]}, {"page": "Victoria Thornley", "response": ["She was part of the British squad that topped the medal table at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, where she won a bronze medal as part of the eight with Alison Knowles, Jo Cook, Jessica Eddie, Louisa Reeve, Natasha Page, Lindsey Maguire, Katie Greves and Caroline O'Connor."]}, {"page": "Jo Cook", "response": ["She was part of the British squad that topped the medal table at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, where she won a bronze medal as part of the eight with Alison Knowles, Jessica Eddie, Louisa Reeve, Natasha Page, Lindsey Maguire, Katie Greves, Victoria Thornley and Caroline O'Connor."]}]}}
