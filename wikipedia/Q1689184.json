South Africa began efforts to join the BRIC grouping and on December 24, 2010, was invited to join BRICS. The original aim of BRICS was the establishment of an equitable, democratic and multi-polar world order, but later BRICS became a political organization, especially after South Africa joined. O'Neill told the 2010 summit that South Africa, at a population of under 50 million people, was just too small as an economy to join the BRICS ranks.Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit, London and New York, 6\u20137 December 2010", "The economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China is such that they could become among the four most dominant economies by the year 2050.

Historically, Jim O'Neill, the inventor of the term \"BRIC,\" was the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs. The head of emerging markets for Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Ruchir Sharma, has released a book in 2012: Breakout Nations which mentioned that it is hard to sustain rapid growth for more than a decade.", "In an August 2010 op-ed, Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs argued that Africa could be considered the next BRIC. Analysts from rival banks have sought to move beyond the BRIC concept, by introducing their own groupings of emerging markets. Proposals include CIVETs (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa), the EAGLES (Emerging and Growth-Leading Economies) and the 7 percent club (which includes those countries which have averaged economic growth of at least 7 percent a year).", " The capital \"S\" in BRICS stands for South Africa.

Both are experiencing rapid GDP growth of 5% every year, a figure comparable to Brazil from the original BRICs. Jim O'Neill, expert from the same bank and creator of the economic thesis, stated that in 2001 when the paper was created, it did not consider Mexico, but today it has been included because the country is experiencing the same factors that the other countries first included present. While South Korea was not originally included in the BRICs, recent solid economic growth led to Goldman Sachs proposing to add Mexico and South Korea to the BRICs, changing the acronym to BRIMCK, with Jim O'Neill pointing out that Korea \"is better placed than most others to realize its potential due to its growth-supportive fundamentals\"."]}, {"page": "Roy Gardner (businessman)", "response": ["Gardner became a director of Manchester United in December 1999.
