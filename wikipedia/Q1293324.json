However, Edward Rennie, then a professor at the University of Adelaide advised Helen's father that she was too young to commence study in Medicine, so in 1896, Mayo enrolled in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Adelaide. The death of her younger sister Olive at the end of her first year of study meant that Mayo was unable to sit her final exams for that year, and when she repeated her first year in 1897, she failed two of her five subjects (Latin and Greek). Having gained her father's permission, Mayo enrolled in medicine in 1898. She was a distinguished medicine student, coming top of her class and winning the Davis Thomas scholarship and the Everard Scholarship in her fourth and fifth years of study, respectively."]}, {"page": "List of Old Sydneians", "response": ["* Edward Rennie, chemist"]}, {"page": "1852 in Australia", "response": ["*19 August \u2013 Edward Rennie"]}, {"page": "Thomas Elder", "response": ["* Edward Rennie M.A. D.Sc., Elder Professor of Chemistry 1886\u20131927"]}, {"page": "Rennie", "response": ["* Edward Rennie (1852\u20131927), Australian scientist"]}, {"page": "Archibald Liversidge", "response": ["In 1872 Liversidge accepted the appointment of 'Reader in Geology and Assistant in the Laboratory' at the University of Sydney and began his duties there early in 1873. Liversidge became professor of geology and mineralogy in 1874, and in 1876 he published The Minerals of New South Wales, being a reprint of a paper read at the Royal Society of New South Wales in December 1874. A second and enlarged edition appeared in 1882 and a third edition in 1888. Edward Rennie was a pupil and the two men were in contact until Liversidge's death. In 1878 he visited the leading museums, universities and technical colleges of Europe, and by 1879 he had persuaded the senate to open a faculty of science. In 1880 his Report upon certain Museums for Technology, Science and Art, was published at Sydney. In this same year, Liversidge visited Europe as a trustee of the Australian Museum and his report helped to establish the Industrial, Technological and Sanitary Museum which formed the basis of the present Powerhouse Museum's collection.MacLeod, Roy (Sydney: , 2009). In 1881 the title of his chair was altered to chemistry and mineralogy, and in 1891 to chemistry only. Liversidge was dean of the faculty of science from its foundation in 1882 until 1904; he also founded the school of mines at the University in 1892.
