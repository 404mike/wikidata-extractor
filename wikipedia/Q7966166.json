Initially focused on production of chains and anchors, the business later also produced axles and railway buffers. By the last decade of the 19th century, it was delivering forgings to Admiralty specifications - a customer relationship that continued throughout World War I. Somers' company also produced parts of the anchors used on the RMS Titanic.In 1907 Somers bought Belle Vue House on Mucklow Hill, installing electricity in the house. Overhead lines from a generator at Somers' works supplied current for the house until the 1920s when it connected to public services.Somers died in 1917, leaving the company under the direction of his two sons, Seth and Frank. Frank Somers was managing director until 1954.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Repton", "response": ["* Walter Somers, engineer and industrialist, was born in Repton in 1839."]}, {"page": "Halesowen", "response": ["* Walter Somers, ironmaster"]}, {"page": "David James, Baron James of Blackheath", "response": ["During his time at Eagle Trust he triggered the Iraqi supergun affair.
