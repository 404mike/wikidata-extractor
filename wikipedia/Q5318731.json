Some fellow artists have made negative comments about Collins publicly. In 1990, former Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters criticised Collins's \"ubiquitous nature\", including his involvement in the Who's 1989 reunion tour. David Bowie dismissed some of his own 1980s output as his \"Phil Collins years/albums\". In addition to the song's negative press from music journalists, singer-songwriter and political activist Billy Bragg criticised Collins for writing \"Another Day in Paradise\", stating: \"Phil Collins might write a song about the homeless, but if he doesn't have the action to go with it he's just exploiting that for a subject.\" Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher criticised Collins on multiple occasions, including the comment: \"Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good. Look at Phil Collins.\" Collins said he has \"at times, been very down\" about Noel Gallagher's comments. Gallagher's brother, Oasis singer Liam, also recalled the \"boring\" Collins's chart dominance in the 1980s and stated that, by the 1990s, it was \"time for some real lads to get up there and take charge\". Appearing on the BBC television series Room 101 in 2005, in which guests discuss their most hated things and people, Collins nominated the Gallaghers to be sent into the eponymous room. He described them as \"horrible\" and stated: \"They're rude and not as talented as they think they are. I won't mince words here, but they've had a go at me personally.\""]}, {"page": "Mustique", "response": ["* Dylan Jones"]}, {"page": "GQ", "response": ["* Dylan Jones (1999\u20132021)"]}, {"page": "Aja (album)", "response": ["Jazz historian Ted Gioia cites Aja as an example of Steely Dan \"proving that pop-rock could equally benefit from a healthy dose of jazz\" during their original tenure, which coincided with a period when rock musicians frequently experimented with jazz idioms and techniques. In the opinion of Pitchforks Amanda Petrusich, it is \"as much a jazz record as a pop one\", while Ben Ratliff from The New York Times says it \"created a new standard for the relationship between jazz and rock, one that was basically irreproducible, by Steely Dan or anyone else ... a progressive jazz record with backbeats, a '70s hipster's extension of what had been Gil Evans's vision two decades earlier.\" In Dylan Jones' list of the best jazz albums for GQ, Aja ranked 62nd."]}, {"page": "Arena (magazine)", "response": ["Arena launched the careers of several prominent British media professionals, among them Dylan Jones, the editor of GQ UK who had served as Arena's editor in the late 1980s."]}, {"page": "Never Let Me Down", "response": ["Retrospectively, Never Let Me Down has received unfavourable reviews, with many criticising its production, and is generally considered one of Bowie's weakest releases. Critic Charles Shaar Murray told journalist Dylan Jones in the 2010s that he thought Never Let Me Down was \"just awful\" compared to Tonight, which he called \"an album of classy filler with no center\". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the magazine also compared the album to its predecessor, writing: \"Tonight was an expensive quickie padded with lame covers, while Never Let Me Down made things even worse with originals.\" Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that \"while it's not as consistent as Tonight, [Never Let Me Down is] far more interesting\". Reviewing the album's 2018 remaster, O'Leary summarised: \"For all of its flaws, Never Let Me Down has a unity \u2013 the album has a somewhat charming period \u2013\u00a0piece feel to it now. It's one of the most time-stamped '1987' records ever made.\" Looking back in 2019, Ultimate Classic Rocks Patrick Moran considered Never Let Me Down to be \"far from being the nadir of Bowie's long stretch between Let's Dance in 1983 and Outside in 1995,\" although it still remains one of his worst. Calling it \"an undigested mix of ideas, time signatures and grooves that never quite comes together\", Moran concluded: \"Never Let Me Down can boast a handful of tracks that are a credible mix of the commercial and the experimental, a characteristic which has always been the mainstay of Bowie's best work.\""]}, {"page": "The Buddha of Suburbia (album)", "response": ["While promoting his then-upcoming album Black Tie White Noise in February 1993, David Bowie spoke with British novelist Hanif Kureishi for Interview magazine. Kureishi sought permission to use some of Bowie's older material for an upcoming adapation of his 1990 novel The Buddha of Suburbia. The novel, which concerned a teenage boy named Karim attempting to be an actor in the 1970s, featured a character named Charlie who becomes embroiled with the rock star life. In The Complete David Bowie, biographer Nicholas Pegg describes Charlie as an amalgamation of Bowie, Sid Vicious and Billy Idol. Kureishi told biographer Marc Spitz that the novel \"reminded [Bowie] of his own youth\". Bowie agreed to compose the music and months later, Kureishi and the serial's director Roger Michell ventured to Switzerland to see what Bowie had come up with. According to Pegg, Bowie had completed close to 40 pieces by the early summer of 1993. Kureishi suggested revisions, after which Bowie decided to turn the project into a new album\u2014what Chris O'Leary calls a \"quasi-soundtrack\". Speaking with journalist Dylan Jones, Kureishi stated: \"[Bowie] said he wanted to write some songs for it because he wanted to make some money out of it.\""]}, {"page": "I-D", "response": ["The magazine is known for its innovative photography and typography and as a training ground for fresh talent.

Weller was a big fan of Place Vend\u00f4me, an album that the Swingle Singers recorded with the Modern Jazz Quartet in 1966 which uniquely blended the Singers' stylish vocal harmonies with the MJQ's abstract jazz devices, and it inspired Weller to ask the Swingle Singers to contribute to the Style Council song. The song's \"emotionally explicit lyric\" is, in the words of Dylan Jones, \"unnervingly at odds with the lush arrangement, much in the vein of Elvis Costello.\" He felt the song successfully emphasized \"Weller's immersion in quasi-classical music.\"", "Paul Lester wrote very favourably of the album in Uncut, describing it as the magazine's favourite Style Council album and saying it provides \"the most credible, and most compelling, depiction of 'the real Paul Weller' : the sentimental, wistful romantic luxuriating in European melancholy (strings, piano, synths); the suburban soulboy in love with modern America.\" Journalist John Reed felt the album \"might just be the most misunderstood album in recent pop history,\" feeling the album \"towers over even solo pinnacles like Stanley Road\". Reed compared the album to Dexys Midnight Runners' Don't Stand Me Down (1985), similarly \"a potent mix of musical ambition and soul-searching\" released to mixed reception. Gary Crowley wrote that he liked the album a lot: \"This is an album I go back and listen to every now and then.\" In 2008, John Lewis wrote in Uncut that the album was \"well worthy of reappraisal.\" In the book The Eighties: One Day, One Decade, journalist Dylan Jones described Confessions of a Pop Group as the pinnacle of the band's career, and that Weller's only problem \"was convincing other people that this was the case.\""]}, {"page": "Nick Logan", "response": ["In 1990, shortly before being awarded the inaugural Marcus Morris Award for magazine innovation, Logan was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw and forced to take a nine-month sabbatical from work.
