A battling left-handed opening batsman, Hewett could post a large score in a short time against even the best bowlers. Capable of hitting the ball powerfully, he combined an excellent eye with an unorthodox style to be regarded at his peak as one of England's finest batsmen.\nHewett was educated at Harrow School, won a Blue at Oxford in 1886 and played for Somerset from 1884. As an inconsistent middle-order batsman he made little impact during this period. Even so, he was appointed captain of Somerset in 1889. Over the next two years, his leadership and performances as an opening batsman were instrumental in the county regaining first-class status and admission to the County Championship in 1891. He remained Somerset captain for a further three seasons, usually opening the batting with Lionel Palairet. In 1892, they shared a partnership of 346 for the first wicket, of which Hewett scored 201. The stand remains the county's highest first-wicket partnership. In that season, Hewett made 1,405 runs at an average of more than 35, and was named as one of the \"Five Batsmen of the Year\" by Wisden. England did not play any Test matches at home in 1892, or else Hewett would probably have won a Test cap; instead his highest accolade was being selected to play for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's in 1894. A disagreement over whether play should take place on a sodden pitch in the match against the Australians in 1893 led to Hewett's departure from Somerset at the end of that season.\nHe played first-class cricket for three more years, during which time he scored centuries against both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, appearing for a variety of amateur and representative sides. Having been selected to captain an \"England XI\" at Scarborough in 1895, Hewett was involved in another incident caused by a wet pitch. Feeling insulted by shouts of derision from the crowd, he left the match at lunch-time on the first day. He made only one further first-class appearance: playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University in 1896. Hewett practised as a barrister, having been called to the Bar at the Inner Temple.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1892 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Herbie Hewett 1407 @ 35.17 (HS 201)", "* Wisden Five Batsmen of the Year \u2013 Herbie Hewett, Lionel Palairet, Walter Read, Stanley Scott, Andrew Stoddart"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Herbie Hewett"]}, {"page": "1892 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden (Five Batsmen of the Year) \u2013 Herbie Hewett, Lionel Palairet, Walter Read, Stanley Scott, Andrew Stoddart  ", "|Herbie Hewett || Somerset || 16 || 1047 || 40.26 || 1 || 9", "|Herbie Hewett || Gentlemen, Somerset, South of England || 24 || 1407 || 35.17 || 1 || 11"]}, {"page": "Lionel Palairet", "response": ["Palairet was educated at Repton School.

He achieved his cricketing Blue in each of his four years at Oxford, and captained the side in 1892 and 1893. For Somerset, he frequently opened the batting with Herbie Hewett. In 1892, they shared a partnership of 346 for the first wicket, an opening stand that set a record for the County Championship and remains Somerset's highest first-wicket partnership. In that season, Palairet was named as one of the \"Five Batsmen of the Year\" by Wisden.", "Oxford's batting was described by the Oxford cricket historian Geoffrey Bolton as \"unreliable\" during 1891, Palairet's second year at the university. Palairet's batting average of 15.78 placed him fifth amongst his peers, and he once again struggled in the University match, scoring two and eleven.Bolton (1962), pp. 136\u2013139. Although he generally batted as part of the middle order for Oxford, he invariably opened the innings for Somerset alongside his captain, Herbie Hewett. In this role he thrived for Somerset; his average for the county in ten matches was 31.11, placing him among the top ten batsmen in the County Championship. He scored his debut century in first-class cricket that year, with 100 runs against Gloucestershire. Palairet had agreed to tour North America with Lord Hawke's party, but he demurred late, and was replaced by Somerset teammate Sammy Woods."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Herbie Hewett (1864\u20131921), English first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset cricket captains", "response": ["Since attaining first-class status, Somerset have named 37 official captains.  Stephen Newton was the club's first official captain, holding the position during the county's first three seasons of first-class cricket, from 1882 to 1884.  Due to his commitments as a schoolmaster in London, he did not play in the opening three matches of 1882, so other players were required to deputise for him in these fixtures. Edward Sainsbury, who took over from Newton for the 1885 season, captained the side in the joint fewest matches along with Mandy Mitchell-Innes: both players captained Somerset in six first-class matches.  During the 1885 season, Somerset failed to arrange sufficient fixtures with the other first-class teams to be retain its first-class status, and matches played between 1886 and 1890 were considered 'second-class'.  During this time, the captaincy was transferred to Herbie Hewett who, after captaining his side unbeaten against county opposition in 1890, retained the captaincy upon Somerset's return to first-class cricket the following summer.Foot (1986), pp23\u201328. Hewett continued as captain for three further seasons, but retired from the captaincy and the club at the end of the 1893 season following an incident in which he felt his authority had been undermined by the club.Foot (1986), pp42\u201345. His successor as captain was Sammy Woods, who remained in the position for twelve years, the longest by any Somerset captain.  Woods, born on the outskirts of Sydney in Australia had played three Test matches for Australia in the late 1880s, and was Somerset's first captain of overseas origin, although he lived the rest of his life in Somerset and also played three Tests for England. He led Somerset in 230 first-class matches, and holds the record for both the most first-class and the most overall matches captained by any Somerset player."]}, {"page": "1869 English cricket season", "response": ["** W.G.

He scored three fifties, and accumulated 272 runs in all for the county, second only to the club captain, Ted Sainsbury. He was less effective in 1888, averaging just 13 runs with a top-score of 27. Despite this, he was elected captain at the club's annual general meeting. Sainsbury, though a good cricketer, was unpopular with the club's committee as he did not live near to Taunton. Herbie Hewett was first proposed, but he declined to take the position. Roe was then elected unanimously to the position, with Hewett as his vice-captain. The club chairman noting that \"considering what Mr Roe had done for the club his appointment would be a well-deserved compliment.\" Despite this, the 1889 season summaries refer to Hewett as being the captain,  and at the annual meeting that year, it was noted that Hewett was re-elected as captain. Whether he was captain or not, Roe had a poor season. He played four of Somerset's eight matches, averaging 6.1 runs. Indeed, half his 43 runs that season came in one innings, when he scored 27. After the close of Somerset's formal county fixtures, Roe found some form, hitting 83 runs against the Gentlemen of Wiltshire, and 104 against the Gentlemen of Devon."]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Matches were played more frequently in August, and Sainsbury and his Somerset team had just four days to recover from their defeat before travelling to The Oval to face Surrey. Sainsbury once again lost the toss and was forced to field. Surrey batted for 222.1 overs as they accumulated 635 runs. Opening bowlers Parfitt and Winter once again conceded a century of runs apiece, and four of Somerset's other bowlers conceded over 50\u00a0runs each. In total, Sainsbury tried seven different bowlers during the innings to try to get wickets, including Herbie Hewett, who completed his career of 106 matches with just two first-class wickets. Sainsbury himself was the most successful of the bowlers, taking four wickets for 74\u00a0runs, his best first-class bowling performance. In reply, Somerset were bowled out for 83 runs, with Clapp recorded as \"absent hurt\". Following on, Somerset mustered a more respectable total of 251, aided primarily by a century from Octavius Radcliffe and 85 from Hewett. Sainsbury himself added 21 to the score in the second innings after being dismissed for one in the first. The defeat was heavier still than the one suffered a week earlier; Surrey won by an innings and 301 runs."]}, {"page": "1892 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1,047 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 40.26 || Herbie Hewett || Somerset"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1890", "response": ["| Herbie Hewett || style=\"text-align:center\"| ||  || Left-handed || Unknown arm medium pace || Club captain"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1891", "response": ["Three of Somerset's players were chosen to play representative cricket during the season.
