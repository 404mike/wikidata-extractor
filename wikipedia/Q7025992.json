Robin Page stepped into the breach to conduct that concert and stayed on as the choir's musical director for 27 years. During that time the choir performed with many professional soloists, including a young Sarah Connolly (now a Dame) in 1992. Towards the end of the century the choir commissioned a new work from Nicholas O'Neill, The Clocks of Cassiodorus, and performed it in 1999.  In 2003 Kingston Choral Society joined with 46 other choirs to commission The Kestrel Road from Peter Maxwell Davies, under the auspices of Making Music, in celebration of his 70th birthday.  The choir gave a concert performance of the work in 2005."]}]}}
