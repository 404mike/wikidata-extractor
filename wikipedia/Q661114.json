In addition to the main pool of writers involved in the show, a number of other writers also submitted various sketches to the show, including Paul Alexander, Simon Booker, Neil Shand, Paul Minett and Dick Vosburgh, the latter whom had previously worked with Everett on his show at Thames. The show was a ratings success for the BBC, repeatedly drawing audiences of around 12-13 million viewers per episode. When the show hit the screens in early 1982, it was lauded by critics; Hilary Kingsley from the Daily Mirror commented \"the first Kenny Everett show was tatty, tasteless and trivial. I loved it!.\" Everett was praised for his inventive comedy style that went against the norm for sketch shows; it was seen as zany, daring and unique, although at times the humour bordered on the grisly and squirm inducing. Towards the end of the show's run in 1987 the reception had changed, it was beginning to look tired and old fashioned as James Green commented in a review for The Stage in December 1987, with its formula of bawdy and surreal humour barely changing over the years. After Series 5 had ended in January 1988, Everett decided not to renew his contract with the BBC due to his growing disillusion with the filming of the show and faltering professional relations with his co-writers. Despite the BBC's intentions for the show to continue, it came to an abrupt end when Everett opted out from doing more shows."]}]}}
