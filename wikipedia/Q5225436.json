According to 2008's Pretty Vacant: A History of UK Punk, the band \"was, in many ways, Britain's first proto-punk band.\" Band members went on to form The Hammersmith Gorillas aka The Gorillas and The Darryl Read Group, as well as pursue solo careers.", "Crushed Butler formed in 1969 with a line-up of Jesse Hector (guitar, lead vocals, songwriter), Alan Butler (bass guitar) and Darryl Read (drums, backing vocals, songwriter).Heibutzki, Ralph \"[ Crushed Butler Biography]\", AllMusic, retrieved 27 September 2009 In 1967 Jesse Hector's (ex Jesse Hector And The Rock 'N' Roll Trio, The Cravats, and The Clique) original group, The Way Of Life broke up which lead to Hector forming the late mod group entitled The Mod Section in 1968. Around the same time in 1967, Darryl Read formed his first group The Orange Illusion with future Silverhead frontman, Michael Des Barres. Both Read and Des Barres were working actors who formed the band on campus at the Corona Theatre School (formerly Corona Academy) the same drama school which they both attended. Some months later after the Corona Academy Acting Director forces Darryl and Michael to disband The Orange Illusion, Read is asked by BBC Radio 1 & Radio Caroline host and disc jockey, Emperor Rosko to assemble a new band for his brother.", "Darryl Read comes up with the name Crushed Butler unlike any of the other thirty band names he jots down, including (unused at the time) the band moniker, The Clash, which he deemed too corny! The band moniker chosen is an anagram of sorts: Alan's surname, Butler, Darryl's initials, D.R.  end the words, and Ray Hector's (\"Ray\", the first name that Jesse was known by at this time) first and last name initials, R.H. are also imbedded. As well as SHED, named after The Chelsea Shed Boys (now known as The Chelsea Headhunters), who are a notorious English football hooligan firm linked to the London football club Chelsea.", "Crushed Butler boasted a striking, heavily idiosyncratic, futuristic visual style. They dressed in hand-cut, slash neck, blood red T-shirts and straight legged, drainpipe, blue or black Levi's trousers with studded belts slung low on the hip. Jesse Hector had short cropped on top hair with massive mutton chops. Hector styled his hair with a skinhead at the back, mod on top, rockabilly sideburns, and a parting in the middle. Alan Butler had a crop cut centre parting hairdo and large sideburns. Darryl Read had a lion's shag of dark hair and continually sported a black leather vintage motorbike jacket, with a blue/white hooped T-shirt and Cuban heels. Altogether their image resembled bovver boys and they looked liked The Clash several years before The Clash formed, and Hector's voice sounded like John Lydon of Sex Pistols only in 1969. Overall the fully formed and modern image of Crushed Butler predated the British punk rock visual aesthetic of 1976 by seven years earlier.", "Barry Mitchell was the same size as the rest of the band, his hair was startling blonde and spikey, not dissimilar to Paul Simonon of The Clash. He played a Gibson SG bass, creating a raw but powerful rhythm section with Darryl Read.", "In autumn 1970, the band changed their name to Tiger, and the line-up also changed to include Arthur Anderson. Darryl Read specifically enlisted  Arthur Anderson in the band because of his Glaswegian thug abilities, and also because he impressed the band with his aggressive bass style. Anderson cut his hair off and looked like a droog from A Clockwork Orange one year before the film was released in the UK. A friend of Darryl Read, David Palmer (Read and Palmer who both attended Corona Film School together) takes new black and white band photos for the group in late 1970, again in Kilburn, near Jesse Hector's mother's council house, as Hector wields bricks, Darryl sports braces, and Arthur sports Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars sneakers. As Tiger they were managed by Neil Christian of The Crusaders as the bands second manager. Neil Christian knew Dave Siddle at the new De Lane Lea studios in Wembley and got Tiger some free studio time as guinea pigs testing the new studio equipment. Tiger recorded five songs at De Lane Lea Studio in October 1970 that remain missing and unreleased as of 2021.", "In summer 1971, Jesse Hector forms new band Helter Skelter with Gary Anderson on drums who previously played in the band Albert Monk. With Vic Allen drafted in on bass, Helter Skelter record three songs at Regent Sound Studio in Denmark Street (the first studio Crushed Butler recorded at back in October 1969). The three songs recorded include \"I Need You\", \"Goodbye Baby\", and \"I Live In Style In Maida Vale\". David Kassner, son of President Records owner David Kassner, produces the session. The session was deemed too aggressive for public consumption at the time in late 1971. However, a Helter Skelter single was released posthumously on President Records subsidiary, Sticky Records, six years later in 1977. Upon the departure of Vic Allen, Alan Butler joined Helter Skelter and the band played many gigs between 1972 and 1973. With a name change (suggested by Darryl Read) inspired by the song \"Hammersmith Guerilla\" by the political proto punk band, Third World War (who were the second British proto punk band after Crushed Butler), Hector and Butler went on to form The Hammersmith Gorillas in 1973, later to be shortened to The Gorillas in early 1976.", "After his stint as drummer, backing vocalist, an co-songwriter in Crushed Butler, Darryl Read was employed by Chris Stamp at Track Records as a professional songwriter working with John \"Speedy\" Keen from Thunderclap Newman. Thunderclap Newman had a number one British hit three years earlier with Something In The Air. In early 1972, Read also formed a songwriting collaboration with Terry Stamp and Jim Avery from Third World War and a new group, \"Stamp, Read 'n' Avery\" was briefly touted but did not come to fruition. However, Darryl and Terry recorded Terry's song \"Razor City\" at Regent Sounds Studio in late 1972. Subsequently, the \"Razor City\" demo helped Stamp get a solo deal with A&M Records. In 1973, Read joined a new group named \"Dizzy\" (featuring Steve Forest, ex guitarist from glam band Silverhead) and in 1975, he formed \"The Darryl Read Group\". The Darryl Read Group (with Steve Forest on lead guitar and Charlie Harty on bass) recorded demos in 1975 and 1976 that lead to a publishing deal with Kenny Barker of Chappell & Co. (now known as Warner Chappell Music). On completion of recording the batch of demos Barker and Read proceeded to play them for Nick Mobbs at  EMI Records, however were unsuccessful in securing a record deal. Later Read pursued a solo career, as well as working as an actor. Read's works included four albums Book Of The Dead (1989) and Beat Existentialist (1991) both with Terry Stamp from Third World War, Freshly Dug (1999) with and Bleeding Paradise (2007) both recorded with Ray Manzarek from The Doors.
