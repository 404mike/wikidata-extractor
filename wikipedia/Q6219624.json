He is the son of former Port Vale player Colin Askey.\nAble to play as a winger or as a striker, he had pace and intelligence. A former youth-team player at Port Vale, he joined Macclesfield Town from Milton United in 1984. During his time at the club Macclesfield spent six seasons in the Football League and won the Northern Premier League title in 1986\u201387, the Football Conference title in 1994\u201395 and 1996\u201397, and promotion out of the Third Division in 1997\u201398. Town also won the Northern Premier League Challenge Cup, Northern Premier League President's Cup, Conference League Cup, Cheshire Senior Cup and Staffordshire Senior Cup. In 19 seasons at the club he scored 155 goals in 679 league and cup appearances, becoming the club's record appearance holder and fourth highest goalscorer; he was named as the club's PFA Fans' Favourites and was later rewarded with the freedom of Macclesfield in August 2018.\nHe stayed on at Macclesfield Town as a coach after retiring as a player and was appointed as manager in October 2003. He was replaced as manager in April 2004, but stayed on at the club as a coach, before he was appointed as manager for a second time in April 2013. He coached Macclesfield to the 2017 FA Trophy final, where they were beaten by York City. The following season, 2017\u201318, he led the team back into the Football League as champions of the National League despite having one of the division's lowest budgets. Following this achievement, he moved on to manage Shrewsbury Town in June 2018, before his dismissal five months later. He was appointed as Port Vale manager in February 2019 and remained in the job until January 2021. He has entered the position of interim manager at York City after Steve Watson was sacked on 13 November.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Macclesfield Town F.C.", "response": ["Manager Sammy McIlroy led Macclesfield Town to the top of the Conference in 1993\u201394, but they were not promoted as Moss Rose did not meet Football League requirements. They won the FA Trophy for a second time in 1996. They again won the Conference title in 1996\u201397 and this time were promoted, winning promotion in their inaugural Football League campaign with a second-place finish in the Third Division in 1997\u201398. However they were immediately relegated from the Second Division. The club stayed in the fourth tier of the Football League from 1999 to 2012, losing a play-off semi-final in 2005, before being relegated back into the Conference. Despite financial constraints, manager John Askey led the club back into the Football League as champions of the National League in 2017\u201318. In 2018\u201319, the club avoided relegation back to the National League, but financial issues continued to affect it. After a points deduction activated on 11 August 2020, the club was relegated to the National League, the 5th tier of English football, for the 2020\u201321 season.", "A dismal start to the following season cost Davenport his job though, and Gil Prescott took over for the remainder of the season, keeping Macclesfield Town clear of relegation. David Moss in turn succeeded Prescott as manager and delivered two decent mid-table finishes, but a bad start to the 2003\u201304 season resulted in his sacking. Club stalwart John Askey succeeded Moss initially on a temporary basis, and earned the job permanently with some promising early results. However, a terrible run of one win in three months meant that Askey's term as manager was short-lived.", "On 5 January 2013, Macclesfield Town beat Championship Leaders Cardiff City in the FA Cup 3rd round 2\u20131. This gave them a place in the 4th round of the tournament for the first time in their 139-year history. Macclesfield Town were generally in or around the Conference National play-off places for much of the season, but a failure to secure a play-off spot resulted in the sacking of Steve King just before the season ended, with the club reappointing former manager John Askey as King's replacement.", "Following the departure of John Askey for Shrewsbury Town, Mark Yates was named as manager in June 2018. Yates departed the club in October 2018 after failing to win any of his first twelve league games in charge. After Danny Whitaker and Neil Howarth briefly took temporary charge, former Premier League and England defender Sol Campbell was appointed manager in November 2018.

Mellon left for Tranmere Rovers in October 2016, and he was replaced by Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst, with Shrewsbury bottom. In 2017\u201318, Hurst led Shrewsbury to the EFL Trophy Final, ultimately losing to Lincoln. He also led the team to the League One play-offs, but lost to Rotherham after extra time. Hurst left to join Ipswich Town on 30 May 2018. He was replaced by former Macclesfield boss John Askey, but he was sacked later that year in November having won just 5 of their opening 21 games. His successor, Sam Ricketts was appointed manager in December. A highlight of the 2019\u201320 season under Ricketts was a fourth round FA Cup tie against the holding European champions Liverpool which Shrewsbury drew 2\u20132. Town narrowly lost the replay 1\u20130 at Anfield in front of an attendance of 52,399. However, following disruption to the season in March 2020 due to COVID-19, final League One standings were decided on a points per game basis with Shrewsbury finishing in 15th place.

This was initially until the end of the season, but Horton was given the job on a permanent basis in May. He rejuvenated a demoralised side and kept them in the Football League, as they finished seven points clear of the relegation zone in 2003\u201304. Over the summer he signed Iraqi international Jassim Swadi, experienced striker Mike Sheron, veteran defender Tony Barras, left-back Mark Bailey, and Tommy Rooney. He allowed Martin Carruthers to leave, though extended Tommy Widdrington's contract, and offered fresh deals to six others. He later added to his squad by signing Mark Boyd and Simon Weaver; whilst transfer listing Tommy Widdrington and Michael Welch. Many pundits were tipping the \"Silkmen\" to slip out of the newly named League Two at the end of the 2004\u201305 season, but Horton proved the observers wrong as his side were in the top-seven of the division virtually all season long. Horton celebrated his 1000th game as a manager on 3 November 2004, as Macclesfield beat Mansfield 4\u20130 in the Football League Trophy. He also won the League Two Manager of the Month award for February. Macclesfield qualified for the play-offs in sixth place, but their promotion challenge was finally ended by Lincoln City in the semi-finals, following a 2\u20131 aggregate defeat. At the end of the season, Horton released nine players, including club captain Matthew Tipton. In the place of these nine players he signed Kevin Sandwith, Kevin Townson, Martin Bullock, and David Beresford.", "Despite high expectations, Horton's men were not to challenge for promotion in the 2005\u201306 season. The club were hit by financial troubles after being told they had to pay fines totalling \u00a3250,000, and at one point were at risk of being wound up. As a result, Horton was forced to cope without assistant John Askey, after Askey was dismissed to cut costs. The sale of top-scorer Jon Parkin also robbed Horton of his best player. Following a poor start to the season he placed four players on the transfer-list. He also placed Kevin Townson on the transfer-list, before sacking the striker after Townson displayed \"serious misconduct\". Throughout the campaign, Horton signed goalkeeper Tommy Lee, striker Clyde Wijnhard, midfielder Alan Navarro, forward Allan Russell, and striker Matty McNeil. The \"Silkmen\" finished in 17th-place, five points above the relegation zone. Horton prepared for the 2006\u201307 campaign by searching for a new midfield player, and found one in Shrewsbury Town's Jamie Tolley. He also signed versatile attacker Colin Heath, defender Carl Regan, and former Port Vale goalkeeper Jonny Brain; whilst releasing five players. Horton was sacked in October 2006, after his team failed to win any of their opening twelve league games, leaving them bottom of the Football League."]}, {"page": "John Filan", "response": ["Filan was appointed as assistant manager to John Askey at League One side Shrewsbury Town in June 2018, having previously worked with Askey during his managerial tenure at Macclesfield Town.

Pugh became a full-time coach upon the expiry of his playing contract at the end of the season, though did take the #14 shirt and sat on the bench following a midfield injury crisis in September 2019. Pugh again became caretaker-manager following Askey's departure on 4 January 2021. Five days later he oversaw a 3\u20130 home win over Grimsby Town in his first game in management. On 18 January, he began self-isolating after testing positive for COVID-19. Club chairperson Carol Shanahan said that Pugh had been unlucky during his time in charge, missing Tom Pope and Devante Rodney to injury and having to self-isolate at home for two games, and she confirmed that Pugh had not applied for the role on a permanent basis. He returned to the touchline in time to oversee a 5\u20131 victory over bottom-club Southend United.
