This new dynamic of musicians and songsmiths led to the 1990 album Chemicrazy, produced by Scott Litt. Working with Litt, the band developed a more alt rock style than before, as hinted at on the final track of the previous album \"Under the Sky\". Although the album's song were more intense than previous work, Chemicrazy also maintained a pure pop heart, exemplified by singles \"Sensitize\", \"Tingle\" and \"Hey Venus\" (the former track sounding particularly R.E.M-esque). Frustratingly for the band, however, the massive predicted sales for Chemicrazy never happened. The album stalled at UK number 62 and its disappointing performance led to the end of the band's contract with Virgin Records.", "Following the band's breakup, drummer Ciaran McLaughlin played jazz for a while\"A whole lot of Everlasting Yeah!
