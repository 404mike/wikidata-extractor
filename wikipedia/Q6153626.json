She is one of the world's leading researchers in structural bioinformatics, using computational methods to understand protein structure and function. She was formerly director of the EBI from October 2001 to June 2015, and played a key role in ELIXIR.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "CATH database", "response": ["The CATH Protein Structure Classification database is a free, publicly available online resource that provides information on the evolutionary relationships of protein domains. It was created in the mid-1990s by Professor Christine Orengo and colleagues including Janet Thornton and David Jones, and continues to be developed by the Orengo group at University College London. CATH shares many broad features with the SCOP resource, however there are also many areas in which the detailed classification differs greatly."]}, {"page": "National Institute for Medical Research", "response": ["* Dame Janet Thornton DBE FRS (born 1949), Director of the European Bioinformatics Institute"]}, {"page": "Threading (protein sequence)", "response": ["Fold recognition methods can be broadly divided into two types: those that derive a 1-D profile for each structure in the fold library and align the target sequence to these profiles; and those that consider the full 3-D structure of the protein template. A simple example of a profile representation would be to take each amino acid in the structure and simply label it according to whether it is buried in the core of the protein or exposed on the surface. More elaborate profiles might take into account the local secondary structure (e.g. whether the amino acid is part of an alpha helix) or even evolutionary information (how conserved the amino acid is). In the 3-D representation, the structure is modeled as a set of inter-atomic distances, i.e. the distances are calculated between some or all of the atom pairs in the structure. This is a much richer and far more flexible description of the structure, but is much harder to use in calculating an alignment. The profile-based fold recognition approach was first described by Bowie, L\u00fcthy and David Eisenberg in 1991. The term threading was first coined by David Jones, William R. Taylor and Janet Thornton in 1992, and originally referred specifically to the use of a full 3-D structure atomic representation of the protein template in fold recognition. Today, the terms threading and fold recognition are frequently (though somewhat incorrectly) used interchangeably."]}, {"page": "List of Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*2012: Mary Archer, Margaret Makea Karika Ariki, Glynis Breakwell, Moira Gibb, Zaha Hadid, Judith Hill, Tessa Jowell, The Baroness Brown of Cambridge, Tina Lavender, Penelope Lively, Julie Moore, Sylvia Morris, The Baroness Neville-Rolfe, Joan Ruddock, Theresa Sackler, Janet Thornton"]}]}}
