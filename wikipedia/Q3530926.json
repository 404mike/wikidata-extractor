A solicitor by profession, Williams would later become a national selector for the Welsh Rugby Union. Williams was also responsible for suggesting the singing of the Welsh national anthem in a match in 1905, the first time a national anthem was sung before a sporting event.\nWilliams was born in Llwynypia into a farming community in the Rhondda Valley and in his early years he lived in at the Tonypandy Inn. A solicitor by trade, he trained for his profession in Pontypridd, probably under Spicketts. Williams was the uncle of Wales international and British Lion Willie Llewellyn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tom Williams", "response": ["Tom Williams or Tommy Williams may refer to:", "*Tom Williams (American football) (born 1969), American former head football coach at Yale University", "*Tom Williams (Australian footballer, born 1880) (1880\u20131950), Australian rules footballer for Essendon", "*Tom Williams (Australian footballer, born 1986), Australian rules footballer for Western Bulldogs", "*Tom Williams (footballer, born 1980), English-Cypriot football player", "*Tom Williams (rugby union, born 1860) (1860\u20131913), Welsh international rugby player and sports administrator", "*Tom Williams (rugby union, born 1887) (1887\u20131927), Welsh rugby union player", "*Tom Williams (rugby union, born 1983), English rugby union player", "*Tom Williams (rugby union, born 1991), Welsh rugby union player", "*Tom Williams (rugby union, born 1996), British born-Welsh rugby union player", "*Tom Williams (outfielder) (1870\u20131940), baseball player", "*Tom Williams (Negro leagues) (1896\u20131937), Negro leagues baseball player", "*Tom Williams (ice hockey, born 1940) (1940\u20131992), American professional hockey player, 1961\u20131976", "*Tom Williams (ice hockey, born 1951), Canadian professional hockey player, 1971\u20131979", "*Tom Williams (racing driver), former American racing driver in 1982 24 Hours of Le Mans", "*Tom Williams (swimmer), American freestyle swimmer, participated in Swimming at the Pan American Games", "*Tom Williams (cricketer) (born 1992), English cricketer", "*Tom Williams (boxer), see Ezra Sellers", "*Tom Williams (actor) (born 1929), American actor, Life with Lucy, Quack Pack and Return to the Planet of the Apes", "*Tom Williams (music), co-founder of Attic Records", "*Tom Williams (presenter) (born 1970), Australian television presenter", "*Tom Williams, Baron Williams of Barnburgh (1888\u20131967), British Labour Party politician, MP 1922\u20131959", "*Tom Williams (Irish republican) (1923\u20131942), IRA member who was hanged", "*Tom Williams (auxiliary bishop of Liverpool) (born 1948), British Roman Catholic bishop"]}, {"page": "Match of the Century (rugby union)", "response": ["Away from the pitch, there were also discussions on a possible response to the Haka. The selector Tom Williams suggested that an appropriately cultural response for the Welsh players would be with singing, and that they should sing the Welsh anthem, \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\".Smith (1980), pg 153. Williams' proposal became a matter of national discourse, with the The Western Mail published numerous articles encouraging Welsh supporters to join the players once the Haka had been completed. Despite the popularity of the suggestion, there was no official plan for a response, and it remained unclear if the crowd would respond at all."]}, {"page": "Tom Williams (Welsh rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Williams (rugby union, born 1860)"]}, {"page": "Tom Williams (rugby player, born 1860)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Williams (rugby union, born 1860)"]}]}}
