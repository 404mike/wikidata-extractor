Preferring to play off the front foot, Pullar was also a good puller of the ball and could crack a square cut. In his younger days he had been compared to Charlie Hallows and Eddie Paynter, two of Lancashire's crowd pleasing greats \u2013 he had the artistry of the former and the pugnacious aggression and watchful determination of the latter.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 1", "response": ["*1935 \u2013 Geoff Pullar, English cricketer (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "December 25", "response": ["*  2014   \u2013 Geoff Pullar, English cricketer (b. 1935)"]}, {"page": "Colin Cowdrey", "response": ["After the poor tour of Australia the previous year a revamped England team was taken to the Caribbean under the management of the forthright Walter Robins. Cowdrey was chosen to open the innings with Geoff Pullar as May thought he was the best player of fast bowling. Even though it was not to Cowdrey's liking he made 491 runs (54.55) and two centuries. England won the Second Test by 256 runs despite play being held up by a riot, but May suffered an internal injury and had to go to hospital every morning before play. May soldiered on, but Cowdrey knew he would soon be in charge and was so affected by nerves before the Third Test that he \"would have given anything not to have played\".Cowdrey, p. 41 To face the fast bowlers he wore rubber padding sewn into his shirt and recovered to make 114 and 97 despite Wes Hall taking 7/69 in England's first innings of 277, no one else making over 30. May had to fly home for treatment (and was unfit to play for 18 months) so Cowdrey took charge in the Fourth Test, winning the toss and top scoring with 65 in England's 295 as Hall took 6/90. The West Indies overtook this with 402, but Ted Dexter (110) and Raman Subba Row (100) saved the match.

Even so, it was the first of only two occasions that Cowdrey captained England throughout a Test series. It proved to be an easy 3\u20130 win as the inexperienced Springbok side met a damp English summer and lost the first three Tests by 100 runs, an innings and 73 runs and 8 wickets. In the Third Test the South African captain Jackie McGlew was run out after colliding with an English fielder, the umpires did not allow Cowdrey to call him back and he was widely blamed for not withdrawing the appeal before McGlew left the field. In the Fifth Test England were dismissed for 155, saw South Africa make 479/9 declared and were criticised by Walter Robins, the new Chairman of Selectors.

Lancashire came close to reclaiming the county championship in 1960 under a new captain, Bob Barber. Five batsmen scored more than 1,000\u00a0runs in the season, and Statham, Higgs and Greenhough all took over 100\u00a0wickets; Lancashire finished runner up due to a poor run of form towards the end of the season: losing four and drawing two of the last six matches after topping the table in August. The following year, however, Lancashire dropped to 13th, due in part to Barber's inexperience and Statham's and Geoff Pullar's England commitments. Things declined further in 1962, under the leadership of Joe Blackledge, who had had no previous first-class experience, as Lancashire dropped to second last, winning only two matches. After a period of unrest, Brian Statham was appointed captain between 1965 and 1967 and Lancashire's results improved. Statham retired in 1968 with 1,816 first-class wickets, a record for the club.

After Australia went 1\u20130 down in Melbourne, Simpson totalling 52 and going wicketless, Simpson produced a match-winning all round performance in the Third Test in front of his home crowd in Sydney to help Australia level the series. On a dry surface where almost the entire square was devoid of grass, Simpson took his Test best innings haul of 5/57, removing specialist batsmen Colin Cowdrey and Geoff Pullar after they had been set, and then cleaning up the tail to restrict England to 279.

A storm hit the ground and stayed for two days just after Australia reached the target, which could have washed out the match and saved England.Benaud, p. 204. As the last two Tests were drawn, this was the difference between Australia retaining and losing the Ashes. Simpson was not prominent in the last two matches. He scored 71 in the second innings of the Fourth Test but made 32 and two ducks in the other innings, and took a total of 2/163 in the last two Tests, conceding more than four runs per over. He ended the series with 401 runs at 44.56 and eight wickets at 46.13. Simpson continued to be prolific away from the Tests, scoring 205 against Western Australia in a Shield match.

In the series, he took 27 wickets at 18.18 and Trueman took 25 at 20.32 so it was this series which set the seal on their famous new-ball partnership.Playfair 1961, pages 53 to 64. At county level, his partnership with Higgs gave Lancashire such a formidable opening attack that, until mid-August, they looked like winning the County Championship, but it was not to be and they eventually lost out to perennial rivals Yorkshire despite winning both the Roses matches (in the one at Old Trafford, the winning run was scored off the last ball of the match with two wickets standing). As for why Lancashire did not take the title, Playfair reckoned it was because they could not cover for Statham and Geoff Pullar when they were absent playing for England.Playfair 1961, pages 96 and 97.

He then bowled Pullar and struck Ted Dexter twice in the chest. Dexter then hit a ball to short leg but was dropped. Davidson then removed Peter May and Barrington before ending with 5/42 as Australia dismissed the hosts for 206 to seize the initiative.

By mid-season, Parkhouse had already made four centuries and, in a season of Test experimentation against a modest Indian side following a disastrous Ashes tour of Australia the previous winter, the England selectors picked him, alongside the young left-handed Lancashire batsman Geoff Pullar, as a new opening partnership for the third Test at Leeds. Wisden reported that the new partnership \"proved highly satisfactory\".

After lunch it was more difficult. Benaud dropped Dexter in the gully on 44 and he reached his fourth 50 of the series. It was Dexter's sixth successive 50 in Tests, equalling Patsy Hendren's England record; having made 85 and 172 against Pakistan and 70, 99, 93 and 52 against Australia, but he was dismissed by Sheppard, who pushed the pull to cover and set off for a run, leaving a hesitant Dexter to be run out by Benaud. Colin Cowdrey came in at 129/2 and took 30 minutes to score, then edging McKenzie (1/58) knee-high to \"the Claw\" at second slip, only to see it dropped. Sheppard edged a cut from Davidson between Jarman and Simpson at second slip, the keeper leapt at the chance and missed, so spoiling Simpson's line of sight. After this they moved slowly, but surely towards their goal in a stand of 104. Benaud (0/69) lacked control and Sheppard drove him to the boundary to bring up his first century in Australia.

Benaud now took the overdue new ball and Davidson (4/54) whipped in a couple of in-swingers to trap first Barrington (35) and then John Murray (0) lbw and England were 221/7. The \"Fighting Freds\" Titmus (32) and Trueman (32) saw out the day with a stand of 35, despite Titmus being dropped by Barry Jarman and by Brian Booth in the deep, which they took to 52 the next morning when Simpson got Trueman and Brian Statham with successive balls, but missed his hat-trick and Titmus saw his stumps sent cartwheeling by Davidson to end the innings on 279. Simpson's 5/57 remained his career best Test bowling and Benaud's 1/60 took him to 228 wickets to match Ray Lindwall's Australian record. Another record was the gate, which on the first day produced \u00a312,534 and 5 shillings. The attendance of 54,476 was a new record for a Friday and second only to the Saturday of the Second Test in 1928\u201329 when over 58,000 people saw called some bloke called Don Bradman serving drinks as 12th man. Bradman was now one of the selectors, as was the Australian captain Jack Ryder.pp. 102\u2013104, Moyes and Goodman", "Alan Davidson (5/25) and Bobby Simpson combined to ruin England's reply. Beginning at medium pace 'Davo' was chopped onto the stumps by an awful looking stroke from Geoff Pullar and tormented Ted Dexter, who played and missed his first four balls. Dexter was out, caught in a superb leaping dive by Simpson off the shoulder of his bat and David Sheppard followed a ball and edged it into Simpson's willing hands. Richie Benaud (1/29) brought himself on before tea and Colin Cowdrey became Simpson's third victim to leave England 37/4. Ken Barrington (21) and Peter Parfitt (28) hung until Barrington was bowled by Garth McKenzie (3/26). The England batsmen had now given up making runs and made only 49 from the last 31 overs of the day. Fred Titmus stayed in for 44 minutes for 6 runs until caught by Brian Booth off Norm O'Neill (1/7). John Murray came in with a strapped shoulder and bravely batted out the day to 86/6. He continued the following morning to make 3 not out in 100 minutes with effectively one hand. McKenzie and Davidson sportingly bowled straight to the injured keeper and settled the matter at the other end. McKenzie dismissing Pullar, caught by O'Neill, and Trueman, caught behind by Barry Jarman. Davidson clean bowled Brian Statham and had Len Coldwell lbw and England were out for 104. It was their lowest score at the Sydney Cricket Ground since 1901\u201302 and gave them a lead of only 64.pp. 108\u2013111, Moyes and Goodman", "England came in to bat in the afternoon and Geoff Pullar did not play his bat to a Garth McKenzie in-swinger and was clean-bowled for 7. Ken Barrington came in instead of Ted Dexter, who was resting after bowling 23 overs in the Australian innings. Barrington lacked his usual assurance and mishit Alan Davidson three times to the boundary on successive balls before hitting him again with the fourth ball, after which Davidson retired with a torn thigh muscle. David Sheppard (30) was stumped by Wally Grout trying to drive Richie Benaud (1/82), giving the captain his 229th Test wicket to pass Ray Lindwall and become Australia's greatest Test wicket-taker. England reached tea with 87/2, but Barrington (63) was bowled by the first ball from Bobby Simpson (1/40) and McKenzie (5/89) removed Colin Cowdrey caught behind (though he thought that it had hit the grass) and Tom Graveney to Brian Booth at leg-slip. Dexter was now left with Fred Titmus at 165/5, but the England captain fought back by driving Simpson to the fence, lifting him for six twice in an over and reaching his 50 off McKenzie in the last over of the day. There was rain on the rest day and the morning of Australia Day, which earned the South Australian Cricket Association \u00a33,000 in insurance and helped bind the wicket, enabling the fast bowlers to lift the ball, but preventing the pitch from breaking up or taking spin. Play began at 1:45 pm with Titmus unsuccessfully appealing against the light and glancing the ball past the seagulls and bird-fancier Bill Lawry at the cathedral end. They played on in a light drizzle and Titmus hit Benaud and Mackay for fours, but when Dexter tried the same against McKenzie he was caught by leaping wicket-keeper off a rising ball. The wet outfield made the ball damp and heavy, and thus useless to spinners, so McKenzie bowled unchanged from the river end except for one over before taking the new ball. With Davidson still absent Ken Mackay took over from the other end. Ray Illingworth gave Grout his fourth dismissal of the innings, and his third catch off McKenzie and Alan Smith skied Mackay to Lawry to reduce England to 275/8. Fred Trueman joined Fred Titmus and \"The Fighting Freds\" thumped 52 runs in 37 minutes. Trueman hit Mackay for four, heaved his first ball from Benaud into the stands and appealed for light. When this was turned down he hit Benaud to the leg boundary for four and over long-on for another six, followed by a four off Mackay before the ball flew off the shoulder of his bat to Benaud at mid-on to be out for 38, one short of his highest Test score. Titmus made his first Test 50, but was given the light and the last 45 minutes were lost, three hours in the day. Mackay (3/80) bowled Brian Statham in the second over of the fourth day to have England out for 331, 62 runs behind Australia. Titmus was left on 59 not out to give him an average of 200.00 at the Adelaide Oval.pp. 123\u2013126, Moyes and Goodmanpp. 115, Titmus", "David Sheppard and Ray Illingworth both suffered from throat infections from the previous day and while Sheppard came to play after seeing a doctor, but Illingworth was sent back to the hotel to recover. Even if Dexter had wanted to go for the runs England's dismal start would have curtailed his ambitions. David Sheppard was caught \u2013 eventually \u2013 by Wally Grout on the first ball of the second over from Ken Mackay (1/13) to give him his 50th Test wicket and Geoff Pullar edged the ball to Simpson in the next over from McKenzie (1/63) to reduce England to 4/2. Ken Barrington and Colin Cowdrey saw the innings safely through the next hour and a half, adding 94 before he was run out by Norm O'Neill for 32. Barrington looked completely assured and began sweeping the Australian spin bowlers as Benaud, Simpson and O'Neill all tried their arm. Dexter was out to one-handed catch by Simpson off Benaud with 100 minutes to go and Ray Illingworth was recalled from the hotel in case he needed to bat, but he was not needed. A ball from McKenzie struck a nerve in Tom Graveney's arm, but after he recovered he settled down to a polished innings to accompany Barrington to his hundred. This was reached with a pull for six off Simpson over long-on, his seventh Test century and his first against Australia. Strangely, the stonewalling Barrington would bring up a Test century four times with a six and he hit another in the same over. Benaud brought in the new ball and gave it to Bill Lawry who nearly knocked Barrington's cap off with a beamer that went for 4 byes followed this with 4 wides, as extras were not counted against the bowler in those days this counted as a maiden. Barrington finished with 2 sixes and 16 fours in his 132 not out and he and Graveney (36 not out) played out the day with an unbeaten partnership of 101 to take England to 223/4.pp. 128\u2013131, Moyes and Goodman", "For the first time since 1936\u201337 the Ashes were in dispute in the final Test of a series in Australia. Unfortunately the Fifth Test was to be played on the lifeless wicket at Sydney, though critics later pointed out that Norm O'Neill was able to play strokes, and that Neil Harvey, Ted Dexter and even Ken Barrington were able to play strokes on similarly lifeless wickets before in the series. Mindful of the Third Test three spinners were selected for the England team for the first time in an Ashes Test; Fred Titmus, Ray Illingworth and David Allen, along with Ken Barrington as a part-time leg-spinner. However, the opener Geoff Pullar was dropped due to an injured knee and Illingworth was brought in as a batsman more than a spinner and he bowled only 15 overs in the match and opened the second innings. Allen was distrusted by Dexter for all that he had been was England's first choice spinner and would take himself to the top of the England bowling averages as a result of this final Test. In any case it appeared that Dexter intended to catch Australia on a spinning wicket, especially if he batted first and caught them on the last day. Richie Benaud was the New South Wales captain and knew the Sydney Cricket Ground better than anyone, but his bowling options were limited. Alan Davidson had recovered from his thigh strain and Garth McKenzie was showing great promise, but the medium-fast seam bowler Neil Hawke was brought in to give them support and rest Davidson. Ken Mackay was dropped in his favour, which weakened the Australian batting, but they still had nine first-class centurions. This left Benaud as Australia's sole specialist spinner, with help from Bobby Simpson and perhaps Norm O'Neill. Peter Burge had made 163, 34 not out, 33 and 54 not out for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield and was brought back into the team at the expense of Barry Shepherd. Dexter won the toss for the second time at Sydney, which had not helped him in the Third Test, and decided to bat.pp142-145, Moyes and Goodmanpp. 127\u2013129, Swantonp. 83, Titmus", "With Geoff Pullar unable to play Colin Cowdrey opened for England again, a role he did not relish and after making two runs he was out, mis-hitting a ball from Alan Davidson to Neil Harvey at backward short-leg, who darted forward to take it at grass height. David Sheppard became Neil Hawke's first Test wicket, catching a full blooded cover drive off his own bowling. This made England 39/2 after 108 minutes and with Ken Barrington entrenched at one end the crowd were looked to Ted Dexter to produce some excitement. The wicket was dead and the sky was clear, so there was no chance of the ball swinging and the famous Sydney Hill was becoming restless, Barrington raising his cap when he was jeered and a slow hand clap started around the ground as Dexter played himself in. This was briefly curtailed when Barrington glanced a full toss from Garth McKenzie for four and Dexter hit three fours off Bobby Simpson. Norm O'Neill caught Barrington on the pads and appealed, but no else joined in and the Englishman stayed put. Australia were running through 14\u201315 overs an hour, the fastest so far in the series, but with such defensive play the effort was wasted. Dexter was out after lunch edging O'Neill (1/38) to Simpson at first slip for 47 and Tom Graveney almost went the same way to Benaud. At 5:15 pm the batsmen appealed for light, but were turned down and five minutes later he glanced McKenzie (1/57) off his legs, but \"Harvey, anticipating, shot out his left hand; he somersaulted and momentarily stood on his head, then he rolled over and sat up, still clutching the ball.\"p. 147, Moyes and Goodman Barrington usually woke up when his century was in sight, and a sweep of Simpson was dropped by Brian Booth, but a drive found its way to the boundary and a single brought up his hundred and a surprisingly generous round of applause from the stadium. He drove Benaud straight to Harvey in the covers, who bruised a finger taking his third catch, out for 101 after 320 minutes. Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus lasted until stumps, with England 195/5 after a full day's play. The second day continued in the same dull way, or perhaps worse as only three boundaries were hit between the two sides. Illingworth (27) and Titmus (34) produced, long, slow innings occasionally interrupted by drizzle before they were both caught by Wally Grout, one off Davidson and the other off Hawke (2/57). Even Fred Trueman played a subdued innings before he was caught by Harvey off Benaud for 30. Alan Smith was bowled by Simpson (1/51) and David Allen and Brian Statham finally livened things up with a last wicket stand of 28 in 35 minutes until Benaud caught Allen off Davidson (3/43). England's 321 had taken them nine and a half hours, an innings more akin to saving a lost cause than trying to win a match.pp. 145\u2013149, Moyes and Goodman"]}, {"page": "MCC tour of Australia in 1962\u201363", "response": ["After a week of settling in and net-practice the MCC drove deep into the bush to play at the gold mining town of Kalgoorlie, 370 miles from Fremantle. A major part of the MCC tour was flying the flag, promoting cricket and earning revenue for the English counties. All these were fulfilled by playing \"bush games\" against local grade cricket teams and as these sides were roughly the equivalent to Lancashire League they provided the tourists with valuable practice before taking on the state sides and Australia. The local captain David Herbert won the toss and put in the MCC to entertain the 4,888 strong crowd. David Sheppard (45) and Geoff Pullar (102) soon found their feet, adding 95 for the first wicket an hour, when \"The Rev\" was brilliantly caught-and-bowled by Gary Duperouzel. Pullar hit a six and 13 fours in his two-hour century. Ted Dexter was run out for 6, but Ken Barrington (46) and Peter Parfitt (45 not out) added 62 in 40 minutes and Dexter declared on 247/4 an hour before tea. Fred Trueman soon bowled the opener Mucciarone, but Campbell (66) and Sounness (48) added 99 for the second wicket in two and a half hours and Campbell hitting Fred Titmus for six. The stand was broken by Ken Barrington's leg-spin, he caught-and-bowled Sounness just before stumps and had Campbell caught behind first thing in the morning. He took another two wickets to finish with 4/44 and Trueman (4/22) finished the tail with the new ball - taking 3/5 in 7 balls - after Titmus (1/55) and David Allen (1/33) each took a wicket as the Country XI was dismissed for 212. Dexter declined to make a game of it and batted out the second day. The 2,877 spectators were entertained with some big hitting from Barry Knight (40), Trueman (36) and John Murray, who hit 2 sixes and 15 fours in his 102, adding 123 inside an hour with Sheppard (59). The MCC made 314/8 in under three and a half hours and the local spinner Menegola took 4/101 in 14 overs, having been hit for 72 runs off 10 wicketless overs in the first innings.

Bobby Simpson had just returned to New South Wales, but they had hired the formidable Tony Lock after the MCC declined to bring him on tour and this was his debut. Lock was the famous Surrey spin twin of Jim Laker, a Slow Left Arm Bowler and the best close fielder in England. He played for Western Australia until 1970-71 and was their captain from 1963\u201364, winning them the Sheffield Shield in 1967-68. Ted Dexter won the toss and elected to bat, but though he made 76 in 113 minutes with 2 sixes and 10 fours the other batsmen struggled as the MCC slumped to 161/7 with Des Hoare taking 4/92. They were rescued by the all-rounder Fred Titmus (88) and wicket-keeper Alan Smith (42), who added 119 in 130 minutes. This was the first eighth-wicket century partnership in WA-MCC matches and a record, but Lock (4/68) took the last four wickets and the innings closed on 303 at stumps.

Shepherd made 40, but the lower order collapsed from 215/3 to 274 all out. Statham topped the bowling figures again with 4/49, Ray Illingworth took 3/70, and Titmus finished a good match with 2/27. Colin Cowdrey was twice missed off Garth McKenzie in the first over and Geoff Pullar was dropped by the normally safe hands of Tony Lock, but they reached 49/0 for a ten wicket win. 12,200 showed up over the three days play, probably lessened by the forthcoming Combined XI match and Commonwealth Games.pp. 2-4, Moyes and Goodman", "On to the Adelaide Oval, or rather not as the SACA ringed off the famously long curves, much to the disappointment of those who liked seeing all-run fives when batsmen hit a straight-drive. South Australia had not won the Sheffield Shield for ten years, but were to do so again in 1963-64 with the help of their multi-talented import Gary Sobers. They were captained by the old favourite Les Favell and had a 19-year-old Ian Chappell in the team, but their slow left-arm wrist-spin bowler David Sincock was unable to play because of his exams. The Melbourne Cup was due to be played during the match, so Ted Dexter and the Duke were off to the races and Colin Cowdrey was in charge. Favell won the toss, batted, and saw his side make steady progress to 324/7 by the end of the day. Favell was first out for 7 and his fellow-opener John Causby was run out by Ken Barrington and wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 16, but John Lill (87) and Gary Sobers (42) stroked their way to a third-wicket stand of 113 before they were both out on 154, along with Neil Dansie for a duck and South Australia were 154/4. Ian McLachlan (53) and Ian Chappell (36) added 66 before the youngster tripped over himself while hooking Brian Statham and hit the wicket with his bat. Statham (4/58) cleared up the tail with 3 wickets for 11 runs and South Australia were out for 335. Fred Titmus (1/80) and Ray Illingworth (0/43) failed to turn the ball on the notoriously flat wicket and Cowdrey set up defensive fields which rather relied on the batsmen getting themselves out, still the runs flowed enough and the crowd enjoyed themselves. Cowdrey was out for this third consecutive duck when acting as opener, but everybody else had a fine time; Geoff Pullar (21) added 55 for the second-wicket with Ken Barrington (102), who added another 168 with the stylish Tom Graveney (99), beating the third-wicket record for the MCC vs South Australia set by Plum Warner and George Gunn in 1911-12. Graveney was the more polished of the two, but Barrington hit Neil Hawke (6/130) for 4 boundaries in five balls. They and Peter Parfitt (15) were all out by 257/5, but the depth of the MCC batting was shown by Fred Titmus who hit a solid 137 not out, his highest first class century, adding 108 runs with Barry Knight (55) and 121 with wicket-keeper Alan Smith (another 55) and Cowdrey declared on 508/9. South Australia knocked off the 173 run deficit the same day, making 174/5 by stumps, with Sobers (99) run out by Statham going for his 100th run and everybody else chipping in. A shower of rain allowed everybody to get off the field to watch the Melbourne Cup and Favell declared on 283/7 to leave the MCC 67 minutes to make 111 runs. They made 95/1, thanks to some quick hitting by Pullar (56), but after playing into more rain they gave up 16 runs short in an affable, but farcical end.

Harvey must have had bitter memories of the match four years before which cost him the Australian captaincy; Peter May made 140 and 114, Laker and Lock took 12 wickets and the MCC won by 345 runs. Ted Dexter won the toss and after the loss of Geoff Pullar at 35/1 Dexter marched out and thrashed 102 off 110 minutes, hitting 2 sixes and 13 fours, and the hands of the fielders were left bruised and burning. \"There was a drive off Vievers which sent the ball soaring over the sightboard\".pp19-24, Moyes and Goodman John Woodcock  of The Times wrote \"I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today.

Dexter carried on the innings for most of the next day, seeing Barrington make his first first-class double century (219 not out) and Knight 108, adding 209 for the sixth-wicket. He finally declared 40 minutes for tea for 633/7, had he waited any longer tea would have been taken early, but lost the advantage due to rain. It was the highest score by the MCC or England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the highest by the MCC since Douglas Jardine and company racked up 634/9 against South Australia back in 1932-33. The best bowler was Bobby Simpson who took 3/153 and now made 130 in response, adding 72 for the first-wicket with Thomas (27), 100 for the second with Harvey (51) and 67 for the third with Shepherd (114). Shepherd and McLachlan (55) added another 115 for the fourth-wicket, but David Larter (3/80) took three quick wickets and the Australian XI fell from 415/5 to 451 all out on the fourth and final day. Dexter was 182 runs ahead and could have enforced the follow on, but decided to give his bowlers a rest and batted again, but not very well. Colin Guest took 3/22 in some compensence for his first innings hammering and Dexter declared on 68/5, leaving the Australians 160 minutes to make 251 runs to win. They reached 201/4 thanks mainly to 91 not out from Shepherd and 68 from McLachlan.

Murray was helped off the field and needed three stitches in his forehead, but reports that his jaw had been broken and that his tour was over were exaggerated. Ted Dexter was the best bowler with 2/29 and Southern New South Wales declared on 186/6 in this one innings, one day game. The MCC made the runs despite losing David Sheppard, Peter Parfitt and Tom Graveney as Geoff Pullar made 81 in 66 minutes and Dexter 108 in 71 minutes with 3 sixes and 13 fours.

Ted Dexter won the toss and batted of course, but the MCC innings hinged on Geoff Pullar's 132. Even that was lucky as the Lancashire opener edged the ball to Simpson in the first over who dropped it, just to show that even the best slip fielders are not infallible. Pullar continued to struggle and give other chances, but he put this behind him and stuck to his work, which was just as well as only Dexter (42) and Cowdrey (50) stayed to help him out. 180/2 sank to 303/9 thanks to Benaud (3/61) and Martin (4/122), but tailend \"George\" thumped 30 to bring the total up to 348 a few minutes before stumps. Thomas survived one ball from Fred Trueman, successfully appealed for light and they all trooped back to the pavilion. On the second day Dexter resorted to his negative tactics of bowling on the leg stump with an on-side field, which was meant to restrict strokeplay. In this he failed as New South Wales rattled up 408/5 in the day, causing Benaud the remark that he had better change his way of thinking. Grahame Thomas was quickly bowled by Trueman (1/45), who then left the field with fibrositis and the MCC bowling attack lost all its bite. Simpson made 110 \u2013 his fourth hundred in four matches \u2013 and added 234 for the second wicket with Norm O'Neill, who had lost a few pounds and overcame his bad form to make 143 like a man on a mission.

Davidson (1/11) removed David Sheppard for 7 and then it was all the spinners. Benaud took his best first class innings haul of 18-10-18-7 and Martin (2/32) picked up the wickets of Dexter and Cowdrey as the tourists crumbled to 104 all out to lose by an innings and 80 runs.

Len Coldwell dug the ball in as well and had a good slower ball, but failed to get the ball to swing. Peter Parfitt removed Des Ball with a diving catch at 10/1, but the rest of the day saw la number of missed chances and Queensland reached 123/2 by the end of the day.

Even \"Slasher\" Mackay looked good after this and the dour Queenslander started driving the ball through the covers, adding 85 with Des Hughson (26) and 88 with wicket-keeper Wally Grout who hit a swashbuckling 56 with 2 sixes and 6 fours. Mackay made 105 not out, the first century for Queensland vs the MCC since 1950-51 and their 433/7 declared was their highest score against them since the war. Geoff Pullar had the flu and Colin Cowdrey was also resting, so Peter Parfitt opened with David Sheppard saw the tourists through to stumps then took their stand to 101 the next day. Queensland's overseas player was the West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall and earlier on the Monday one of his bouncers rose awkwardly and broke Grout's jaw, he was hurried to hospital and missed the First Test as a result. Hall (0/106) was overbowled on the now flat Woolloongabba wicket and Queensland's best bowler was the leg-spinner Colin Westaway (3/156), which pretty much sums up the innings as the MCC piled up 581/6. Peter Parfitt made a subdued 47 and David Sheppard was dropped on 51, 77 and 83 before Mackay bowled him for 94. Ted Dexter powered his way to 80 in 85 minutes with a 6 and 13 fours, adding 110 with Sheppard.

Alan Smith came in at 512/6, but when he reached 22 he ducked into a Wes Hall bouncer that stayed low and became the second wicket-keeping casualty of the match. The Duke of Norfolk and the team physiotherapist Sam Cowan helped him off the field and took him to hospital, where to everyone's relief x-rays found that he had not fractured his skull. Dexter declared for 581/6 and John Murray came on as a substitute keeper. Queensland only had to bat out the afternoon, but Mackay re-arranged the batting order and they promptly collapsed to Dexter's medium-paced swing (4/8) and the part-time leg-spin of Tom Graveney (2/2). Mackay came in for the penultimate ball with the score on at 94/7 and was missed in the slips. With Grout unable to bat had Mackay been out the MCC would have needed to take Westaway's wicket with the last ball of the match for a surprise win in an otherwise dull game.pp. 35-39, Moyes and Goodmanp. 122, Swanton", "This was a one-innings one-day game with a case of tinned fruit being given to each batsman who hit a six (Len Coldwell and Ken Barrington) and a pair of socks for everybody who hit a four. The locals batted first again and declared on 191/6 after 40 overs, Ray Illingworth taking 4/65 off 13 overs. This was easily passed by the MCC, who made 196/3 off 31.6 overs, Geoff Pullar hitting 51, Barrington 47 and captain Colin Cowdrey 43 as they batted on to 243 all out.", "Returning to the first-class game the MCC played Victoria and their old nemesis Ian Meckiff, a \"chucker\" who had caused such ill-temper in 1958-59, but was not chosen for this series. His career was ended in 1963-64 when he was repeatedly no balled by Umpire Colin Egar against South Africa. Colin Cowdrey was still in charge and after winning the toss he put Victoria in to bat in the hope that there would be some early life in the Melbourne wicket. Victorian was a weak team in this period and their innings relied heavily on a long, tedious 177 by the 25-year-old captain Bill Lawry who added 85 with Jack potter (44) and 158 with Neville West (70). They staggered to 259/3 by the end of the day and collapsed to 340 all out the next morning, the last seven wickets falling for 72 runs. Brian Statham took 4/112, bowling steadily without any fire and Allen bowled 8 maidens to Lawry in his 3/57. Alan Connolly took 3/71 in reply, removing Peter Parfitt and David Sheppard to have the MCC 26/2. The Reverend walked after being given not out by the umpire, having given a feather-like edge to the keeper Ray Jordon. Cowdrey (46) and Tom Graveney (40) restored the situation with a stand of 81, but Cowdrey was run out and Keith Kirby (3/137) removed Graveney and Barry Knight. The depth of the MCC batting line-up was proven by Ray Illingworth (50), Geoff Pullar (91), batting with a runner after pulling a leg-muscle in the field and Alan Smith (41) before they were all dismissed by Meckiff (3/51). Statham hit a merry 26 and the MCC finished with 336, 4 runs behind Victoria. At the end of the third day Victoria were 135/5 and crashed to 175 all out the next day, Len Coldwell finding the cold weather and heavy atmosphere to his liking and taking 6/49 with his swing bowling. The MCC needed 180 to win and reached there target with five wickets in hand, Colin Guest took 3/32 and removing Pullar (2), Sheppard (50) and Cowdrey (63). It was a dull game and poorly attended, Johnny Moyes noting that Victorian are willing to pay to see good cricket, but the main draw Ted Dexter wasn't playing and this wasn't good cricket.pp. 64-69, Moyes and Goodman", "Ted Dexter missed the first match against South Australian and as the main draw in the MCC side he had to play in the return, even though this meant missing the Victoria game. Johnny Moyes had a solution - two Dexters! He won the toss and batted on the flat wicket at the Adelaide Oval, still roped into a 75-yard circle. Peter Parfitt was a makeshift opener again as Geoff Pullar was recovering from a groin strain and was bowled for 2 and the 19-year-old Ian Chappell dropped David Sheppard in the slips before he had scored. Dexter hit three scorching boundaries before Chappell caught him off a full-blooded cut off Gary Sobers. As the England captain stalked off  he turned to Chappell and said \"You have a habit of getting in the way, young man\". The MCC were now 39/2, but Cowdrey came in and made the highest score of his career. On Christmas Eve (his birthday) he made 307 to beat Frank Woolley's 305 not out against Tasmania in 1911-12 as the highest score by a tourist in Australia. It was the first triple century made in Australia since Don Bradman made 357 and 369 and Jack Badcock 325 in 1935-36. Cowdrey added 103 runs with Sheppard (81), 98 with Ken Barrington then stroked 344 runs with fellow stylist Tom Graveney (122 not out), he hit 4 sixes and 29 fours and when he was out after 389 minutes Dexter declared the innings closed on 586/5. The South Australian captain Les Favell was always a cheery soul and he set about matching this huge total with some brilliant batting. Favell made 120 of the first 165 runs and John Lill (55), Gary Sobers (89), Ian McLachlan (62) and Neil Dansie (64) amassed 425/6, but Ian Chappell was run out by Ken Barrington for 2 and the last four wickets fell for 25 runs. Dexter turned to his spinners during the long innings and Fred Titmus (3/88), David Allen (2/54) and Ken Barrington (3/56) bowled 60 overs between them. Favell's century was the first by a South Australian batsman against the MCC for 16 years and the 128 run partnership between Sobers and McLachlan was a state record against the MCC for the fourth-wicket, beating the 126 made by George Giffen and John Reedman back in 1894-95. David Larter was hit for 0/113 off 22 overs, which pretty much finished his chances of playing in the Test series. South Australia's 450 ended an hour short of stumps, but Peter Parfitt was caught for 7 behind off Gordon Brooks and Gary Sobers bowled David Sheppard for 5. Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey appealed for light, which was refused and took the MCC to 22/2 when bad light finally stopped play at 25 minutes to six. Cowdrey was out for 2 first thing next morning and Dexter (37) smashed a six onto the roof of the stands, the biggest hit anyone could remember at the Adelaide Oval. Barrington made 52 not out and Dexter declared on 167/6, leaving the hosts 304 to win in 140 minutes. Favell took up the challenge, but was out for 3, soon followed by Lill for 2. It rained during the afternoon and the game was a certain draw, but Sobers hit 75 not out in 63 minutes with 12 fours before the game was given up with South Australia 113/4.pp. 71-76, Moyes and Goodman", "The Tasmanians only got to play a two-day game against the MCC, so it did not qualify as first-class, but they did better without the presence of the four internationals from the mainland. The \"chucker\" Gary Brakey was dropped due to a thigh-strain and the game proceeded peacefully enough. Len Maddocks won the toss and batted, but Tasmania made only 203. Ray Stokes made 82, hitting a six off Len Coldwell (2/42) and using his feet well, Maddocks made 33 and Ken Barrington took 4/35 with his part-time leg-spin. Geoff Pullar was back in the side and made 63, adding 143 for the first-wicket with Peter Parfitt (121), but nobody else passed 36 and the fastish bowler Jock O'Brien took 7/73, including a spell of 6/23. There was only time for Tasmania to make 181/6 with Ray Stokes making 76 not out and Cowdrey using eight bowlers. Byron Hyland had been run out for a duck in the first innings, but made 44 in the second and added 100 with Stokes, the first century partnership by Tasmania against the MCC.pp. 97-98, Moyes and Goodman", "Sadly Johnny Moyes died suddenly on the first day of the two day match and his book on the series was completed by Tom Goodman of the Sydney Morning Herald. Due to the exciting Third Test a large crowd came to Newcastle, New South Wales to watch Northern New South Wales, with players from Newcastle, Canberra and Wollongong making up the side. The morning was lost to rain, the local captain won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and got them 180/6, despite Geoff Pullar making 53, but Barry Knight (73) and Alan Smith (45) adding 103 for the seventh-wicket and the MCC finished on 319. Douglas Dives (73) and Rodney Harvey (37) and Ken King (32) made most of the runs in the reply as Northern NSW were out for 203, Len Coldwell took 3/32 and David Allen 3/35. Batting again Dexter made 71 not out and Tom Graveney 41 before the MCC innings was declared at 190/4, leaving the home team 301 to win. After Max Fox (31) and Boxsell (40) added 68 for the first wicket they collapsed to 128/9 as Allen (5/38), Graveney (2/21) and Pullar (3/26) span them out. The crowd were determined to invade the ground on the point of victory, as they had seen in the Sydney Test, but last man Gilmour held everybody up by throwing his bat around for 29 in a last wicket stand of 33. When he was finally caught by Dexter off Geoff Pullar the enthusiastic crowd climbed the fences. Fred Trueman was bowled over and had his cap taken, but he soon recovered it and the teams ran off the field.pp. 114-116 Moyes and Goodman"]}, {"page": "Peter Whiteley (cricketer, born 1935)", "response": ["He made his first-class debut for Lancashire against Nottinghamshire in the 1957 County Championship.
