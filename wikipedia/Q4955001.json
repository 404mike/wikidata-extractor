They had lost five wickets for 175 by mid afternoon but a sixth wicket stand of 94 between Bradley Parker and Peter Hartley (61) boosted the total. Parker's innings was a career best and contained eight fours. Debutant Alex Wharf claimed Brian Lara as his maiden wicket in first-class cricket, to leave Warwickshire on 44/2. Opener Andy Moles (65) and Dominic Ostler put on 191 in 67 overs for the third wicket, building the platform for a significant first innings lead. Twose innings included 21 fours and a six and fell six runs short of a career best score. The visitors closed day two with a lead of 36 and five wickets remaining. Welch scored a third fifty in consecutive matches and aided by contributions from the lower order the lead was increased to 149. Yorkshire began well in response, openers Martyn Moxon and Michael Vaughan (49) put on 93 before the latter was bowled by Richard Davis. Davis took two further wickets in quick succession to reduce them to 109/3. Moxton reached a third century of the season and alongside Richard Blakey put on 92 before play ended. Moxton added 10 to his overnight score but a fluent 77 from Blakey and a spirited 46 by Wharf saw the innings well into the final afternoon. Davis took three further wickets, finishing with his first five wicket haul for the club. The target for Warwickshire was 199 in 49 overs and an opening stand of 89 in 16 overs between Moles (48) and Twose ensured it was a comfortable chase, achieved with eight and a half overs in hand."]}, {"page": "List of doping cases in sport (P)", "response": ["|Bradley Parker"]}, {"page": "Brad Parker", "response": ["* Bradley Parker (born 1970), English cricketer"]}]}}
