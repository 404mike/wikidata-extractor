Downing Street denied that any threats were made. The Telegraph had reported that Miller had claimed \u00a390,000 of expenses between 2005 and 2009 for a house in which her parents were living.

She was responsible for Ed Miliband's interview with Russell Brand, described as a PR blunder.

Rees ultimately says that the book promises to \"do powerful work in service of trans liberation\" alongside other publications of 2021 such as Shon Faye's The Transgender Issue and Finn Mackay's Female Masculinities and the Gender Wars. Hugo Vickers as a reviewer for The Oldie complimented the ambitious nature of the book as a general trans history coverage of the past century interspersed with Forbes's life story, noting that he as a \"general reader\" would have gotten lost in the former without the latter to keep as a steady throughline of the book's historical plot. Giving the book a 4 out of 5 rating in The Daily Telegraph, Tanya Gold commented on just how \"typically British\" it is that the topic of the trans experience in Britain would end up being about the complicated and \"ever-fascinating prism\" of the class system of the country. Covering the book for The Law Society Gazette, Luke Williams pointed out that while the work may have a \"limited relevance to day-to-day practice\" for lawyers, the information regarding cases like Corbett v Corbett and their impact on the legal profession in the UK since is \"invaluable\" and those cases serve as a \"timely reminder of what can happen\" on a quote from the Forbes case judge discussed in the book that \"there are some interests that it is more important to protect than the rights of individuals\"."]}]}}
