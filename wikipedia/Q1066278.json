He studied medicine at St. Thomas Hospital in London, and after receiving his doctorate in 1891, he remained at St. Thomas, working under Edward Nettleship (1845\u20131913). Later he was an eye surgeon at the Aberdeen Hospital for Sick Children, and also worked in the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\nUsher is known for the eponymous Usher Syndrome, which he described in a 1914 treatise titled On the inheritance of retinitis pigmentosa. He based his findings on a survey of 69 individuals who suffered from visual problems associated with deafness. Usher demonstrated that the disease was inherited, and that parents passed the condition onto their children. His discovery was a continuation of the work done by German ophthalmologists Albrecht von Graefe and Richard Liebreich, who did extensive research of retinitis pigmentosa and its link to deafness in the mid-19th century.\nWith Dr. Nettleship and Karl Pearson (1857\u20131936), Usher produced an important work on albinism called A Monograph on Albinism in Man.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of eponymous diseases", "response": ["* Usher syndrome \u2013 Charles Usher"]}, {"page": "Usher syndrome", "response": ["The occurrence of Usher syndrome varies across the world and across the different syndrome types, with rates as high as 1 in 12,500 in Germany to as low as 1 in 28,000 in Norway.

However, it was first described in 1858 by Albrecht von Gr\u00e4fe, a pioneer of modern ophthalmology. He reported the case of a deaf patient with retinitis pigmentosa, who had two brothers with the same symptoms. Three years later, one of his students, Richard Liebreich, examined the population of Berlin for disease pattern of deafness with retinitis pigmentosa. Liebreich noted Usher syndrome to be recessive, since the cases of blind-deafness combinations occurred particularly in the siblings of blood-related marriages or in families with patients in different generations. His observations supplied the first proofs for the coupled transmission of blindness and deafness, since no isolated cases of either could be found in the family trees."]}, {"page": "Charles Howard Usher", "response": ["#redirect Charles Usher"]}, {"page": "1942 in Scotland", "response": ["* 2 March  - Charles Usher, ophthalmologist from whom Usher Syndrome is named (born 1865)"]}, {"page": "Usher, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Usher"]}]}}
