This has included Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony, John Foulds' Le Cabaret, Mahler's Seventh Symphony, Julian Anderson's Alhambra Fantasy, Ligeti's Concert Romanesc, Korngold's Violin Concerto, Stravinsky's Pulcinella, Alban Berg's Seven Early Songs and J\u00f6rg Widmann's Con brio.  In February 2007 it gave the world premiere of Streamlines by Tansy Davies, a work commissioned by the Feeney Trust specifically for the CBSO Youth Orchestra. Subsequent commissions have included Pi\u00f9 Mosso by Luke Bedford (premiered October 2009) and Leckey by Ben Foskett (premiered October 2011). New works from Charlotte Bray and Mark Anthony Turnage are scheduled for February and November 2014 respectively."]}, {"page": "London Children's Ballet", "response": ["2006 The Scarlet Pimpernel Choreographer: David Fielding Composer: Ben Foskett"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Paterson", "response": ["*Ben Foskett: Dinosaur with the Hall\u00e9 for NMC"]}]}}
