A cousin of Tom Holford, he was noted for his \"Kirkham Special\" hook shots, intelligent football and prolific scoring record.After spending time with Cobridge Church and Congleton Town, he graduated as a teacher. Splitting his time between teaching and playing football, he turned professional with Port Vale in 1923. After six prolific seasons with the \"Valiants\", he was sold on to rivals Stoke City for a \u00a32,800 fee after the Vale suffered relegation out of the Second Division.

He added 19 goals in 51 appearances, before announcing his retirement in summer 1933. His combined tally in his ten years at both Stoke-on-Trent clubs is 194 goals in 327 games.

Vic Rouse, Alf Bennett, and David Rollo were let go, Rouse joining Crewe Alexandra. Club legend Tom Page also left the club after racking up 286 Football League appearances. With a \u00a31,223 drop in gate receipts there were fears that the club might close, these fears were heightened when fellow legend Wilf Kirkham was sold to Stoke City for \u00a32,800 (the second highest transfer the club had ever received).", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Wilf Kirkham", "|1||FW||||Wilf Kirkham||15||0||15", "| Summer 1929 || FW ||  || Wilf Kirkham || Stoke City || \u00a32,800 || "]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw the directors spend some of the \u00a32,600 they received in the sale of Wilf Kirkham.
