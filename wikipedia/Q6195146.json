He started and finished his career as a player in Ireland, but made most of his professional appearances in the English Football League at Stockport County, where supporters elected him as a member of the Hall of Fame.\nGannon began his playing career at Dundalk, but moved to English club Sheffield United in 1989. The next year he transferred to Stockport County, following a short loan spell with Halifax Town. He spent the next ten years at Stockport, becoming one of the club's most loyal servants, and helped the club to second-place finishes in both the Second Division and Fourth Division, as well as two League Trophy finals. After leaving the club in 2000, he spent a season with Crewe Alexandra, before returning to Ireland with Shelbourne, winning two League of Ireland Premier Division titles in his three years there.\nStarting a career in management, he took charge of his first club Dundalk in 2004. After a season in Ireland he returned to Stockport County as manager. There he led the club to promotion from League Two via the play-offs in 2008. Leading County to safety in League One despite a ten-point deduction for entering administration, he lost his job as part of a cost-cutting measure. Heading to Scottish Premier League side Motherwell, he managed the club in the Europa League, but left after just 25 games in charge. He took charge of Championship side Peterborough United in 2010, but stayed at the struggling club for only two months, turning down a four-year contract. In January 2011 he was appointed manager of Port Vale, but lasted just ten weeks in the job. He returned to Stockport in November 2011, as the club's director of football and manager, before being sacked in January 2013. He took charge at Northwich Victoria in December 2013.

Foyle was dismissed in November 2007, and his successor, Lee Sinnott, proved unable to prevent the club from being relegated into League Two after a 23rd-place finish and also oversaw a defeat to Southern League Division One Midlands club Chasetown in the FA Cup. Sinnott was sacked in September 2008 and following an unsuccessful tenure from Dean Glover, Micky Adams was appointed as the club's new manager in June 2009. Adams left the club in December 2010 with Vale second in the table and Jim Gannon was selected to finish the promotion job. However, Gannon's turbulent reign ended after 74 days. Adams returned as manager at the end of the 2010\u201311 campaign, but this was not enough to placate fans who demanded a change in the boardroom after a series of promised investments failed to come to fruition."]}, {"page": "Motherwell F.C.", "response": ["League Cup final, although they were comprehensively defeated by Rangers.
