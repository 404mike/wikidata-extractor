Forensic tests were inconclusive. In his book They All Love Jack, writer, researcher, and filmmaker Bruce Robinson produced an argument that it was his brother, Michael Maybrick, who was the true killer. A serial killer, who became known as the Servant Girl Annihilator, preyed during 1884 and 1885 upon the city of Austin, Texas, and there have also been attempts to link Maybrick to those murders.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 25", "response": ["*  1838   \u2013 James Maybrick, English cotton merchant, victim of the \"Aigburth Poisoning\" (d. 1889)"]}, {"page": "Aigburth", "response": ["* Florence Maybrick, convicted murderer, wife of James Maybrick, cotton broker, murder victim and Jack the Ripper suspect"]}, {"page": "The Black Museum", "response": ["*Four famous murder cases were dramatized on The Black Museum: John George Haigh, the \"Acid Bath Murderer\"; George Joseph Smith, the \"Brides in the Bath Murderer\"; Adelaide Bartlett, whose husband died from chloroform poisoning; and Florence Maybrick, who allegedly used arsenic from fly-paper to murder her husband James Maybrick."]}, {"page": "Bruce Robinson", "response": ["Robinson eventually returned to directing with an adaptation of Hunter S.

On 27 July 1881, the couple were married at St James's Church, Piccadilly, in London. They settled in Battlecrease House, Aigburth, a suburb of Liverpool.Ryan Jr., Bernard.

His doctors treated him for acute dyspepsia, but his condition deteriorated. On 8 May, Florence wrote a compromising letter to Brierley, which was intercepted by Alice Yapp, a nanny who hated Florence. Yapp intercepted all letters sent by Florence and passed them onto Maybrick's brother, Edwin, who was staying at Battlecrease. Edwin, himself by many accounts one of Florence's lovers, shared the contents of the letter with his brother Michael Maybrick, who was effectively the head of the family and who also hated Florence. By Michael's orders Florence was immediately deposed as mistress of her house and held under house arrest. On 9 May, a nurse reported that Florence had surreptitiously tampered with a Valentine's Meat Juice bottle that was afterwards found to contain a half-grain of arsenic. Florence later testified that her husband had begged her to administer it as a pick-me-up.
