After his death, his wife, Florence Maybrick, was convicted of murdering him by poisoning in a sensational trial. The \"Aigburth Poisoning\" case was widely reported in the press on both sides of the Atlantic.\nMore than a century after his death Maybrick was accused of being the notorious serial killer Jack the Ripper, owing to his own words in a diary, but critics countered that the diary and confession are a hoax. Forensic tests were inconclusive. In his book They All Love Jack, writer, researcher, and filmmaker Bruce Robinson produced an argument that it was his brother, Michael Maybrick, who was the true killer. A serial killer, who became known as the Servant Girl Annihilator, preyed during 1884 and 1885 upon the city of Austin, Texas, and there have also been attempts to link Maybrick to those murders.", "link_mentions": {}}}
