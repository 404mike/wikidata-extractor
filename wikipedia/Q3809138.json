Halevy, Victorian Years (London, 1961), p. 257. John Carey in \"The truculent genius of Thomas Carlyle\", a review in Books and Bookmen in 1983, says: \"The standard view, which is that Carlyle was so poisonous it's a wonder his mind didn't infect his bloodstream.\"  On Carlyle's attitude to slavery he adds: \"Carlyle was a racist, with a rare talent for misreading historical trends.\" Likewise, Charles Darwin, in his autobiography, called his views of slavery \"Revolting.

This view, and Carlyle's support for the repressive measures of Governor Edward Eyre in Jamaica during the Morant Bay rebellion, further alienated him from his old liberal allies. As Governor of the Colony, Eyre, fearful of an island-wide uprising, forcibly suppressed the rebellion and had many black peasants killed. Hundreds were flogged. He also authorised the execution of George William Gordon, a mixed-race colonial assemblyman who was suspected of involvement in the rebellion.  These events created great controversy in Britain, resulting in demands for Eyre to be arrested and tried for murdering Gordon. John Stuart Mill organised the Jamaica Committee, which demanded his prosecution and included some well-known British liberal intellectuals (such as John Bright, Charles Darwin, Frederic Harrison, Thomas Hughes, Thomas Henry Huxley, and Herbert Spencer)."]}, {"page": "Martin Marprelate", "response": ["The Marprelate tracts are important documents in the history of English satire: critics from C.
