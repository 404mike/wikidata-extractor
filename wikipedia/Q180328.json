He has been referred to as a Tartan Noir author. His debut novel was Quite Ugly One Morning and subsequent works have included One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night, which he said \"was just the sort of book he needed to write before he turned 30\", and All Fun and Games until Somebody Loses an Eye (2005).  Between April 2008 and December 2015, he was the President of Humanist Society Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 6", "response": ["*  1968   \u2013 Christopher Brookmyre, Scottish author"]}, {"page": "Scottish literature", "response": ["From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. Scottish play writing became increasingly internationalised, with Scottish writers such as Liz Lochhead and Edwin Morgan adapting classic texts, while Jo Clifford and David Greig investigated European themes.J. MacDonald, \"Theatre in Scotland\" in B. Kershaw and P. Thomson, The Cambridge History of British Theatre: Volume 3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), , p. 223. This period also saw the emergence of a new generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Kathleen Jamie, Douglas Dunn, Robert Crawford, and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post."]}, {"page": "Barrhead", "response": ["* Christopher Brookmyre, author"]}, {"page": "Bothwell", "response": ["* Christopher Brookmyre (Scottish crime novelist)"]}, {"page": "List of fictional journalists", "response": ["* Jack Parlabane, from the novels of Christopher Brookmyre"]}, {"page": "List of University of Glasgow people", "response": ["* Christopher Brookmyre, writer"]}, {"page": "Country of the Blind", "response": ["Published in 1997 Country of the Blind is Christopher Brookmyre's second novel.
