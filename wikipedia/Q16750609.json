Hind or A. M. Hind.  He specialized in old master prints, and was Keeper of the Department of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum until he retired in 1945.\nMany prints continue to be referred to by the numbers from his catalogue of Italian engravings in the British Museum, a work begun in 1910 and published in expanded form in four volumes in 1948, with another three in 1948.  His classic introductory books A [Short] History of Engraving and Etching (1908) and An Introduction to a History of Woodcut (1935) continued to be reprinted for decades by Dover Publications.  The former was described by a later curator as \"perhaps the most influential general guide ever written to the history of printmaking\".With Campbell Dodgson, his predecessor as Keeper, he participated in the \"heated atmosphere of rumour and anticipation\" (as Dodgson put it in 1927) around the major sales of first half of the century, many dispersing German aristocratic collections, with Berlin, Munich and Americans the main competitors.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albrecht Altdorfer", "response": ["Altdorfer was a significant printmaker, with numerous engravings and about ninety-three woodcuts. These included some for the Triumphs of Maximilian, where he followed the overall style presumably set by Hans Burgkmair, although he was able to escape somewhat from this in his depictions of the more disorderly baggage-train, still coming through a mountain landscape.  However most of his best prints are etchings, many of landscapes; in these he was able most easily to use his drawing style.  He was one of the most successful early etchers, and was unusual for his generation of German printmakers in doing no book illustrations. He often combined etching and engraving techniques in a single plate, and produced about 122 intaglio prints altogether. Many of Altdorfer's prints are quite small in size, and he is considered to be of the main members of the group of artists known as the Little Masters. Arthur Mayger Hind considers his graphical work to be somewhat lacking in technical skill but with an \"intimate personal touch\", and notes his characteristic feeling for landscape."]}, {"page": "Burton upon Trent", "response": ["* Arthur Mayger Hind (1880\u20131957), art historian and Keeper of the Department of Prints, British Museum, 1933\u20131945"]}, {"page": "Slade Professor of Fine Art", "response": ["* Arthur Mayger Hind (1921, 1923)"]}, {"page": "Martin Schongauer", "response": ["According to Arthur Mayger Hind, Schongauer was one of the first German engravers to \"rise above the Gothic limitations both of setting and type\" and that he \"actualises an idea of beauty which in its nearer approach to more absolute ideals appeals to a far more universal appreciation\" than earlier engravers such as Master E.

He trained in the workshop of the leading goldsmith and painter in Bologna, Francesco Francia. Vasari claimed that Marcantonio quickly demonstrated more aptitude than Francia, and started designing and producing fashionable waist-buckles (among other items) in niello  (engraved metal which is filled in with alloy in a contrasting colour).
