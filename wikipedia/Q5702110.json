The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows. The coat of arms of Somerville and of co-founder John Percival, first Principal Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre and Helen Darbishire were carved by Edmund Ware inside the quadrangle.

At first he served as a gunner with a training regiment near Dover and then, from 1940 until 1943 was a camouflage officer with Camouflage Command in Farnham and later in Bristol. In 1943, the War Artists Advisory Committee, WWAC, offered Coldstream a full-time commission which he accepted, having previously declined to work for the Committee. He was stationed in Cairo with an Indian transport unit and painted four portraits of individuals there. From Cairo he travelled to Italy, painting buildings in Capua, Rimini and Florence. Due to his slow means of working, Coldstream only produced nine pictures during his WAAC commission. He also painted Helen Darbishire in her role as principal of Somerville College, Oxford."]}, {"page": "Emily Penrose", "response": ["In 1907 Penrose was appointed as Principal of Somerville College, Oxford, following the death of her predecessor, Agnes Maitland. Given her own academic qualifications, Penrose was described by the noted author and activist Vera Brittain in her history of Women's Education at Oxford as \"the first genuine scholar among women [college] principals\", and part of the significant transition towards colleges headed by figures with academic careers in their own right. In the beginning of her time at the college Penrose also served as the tutor for Greats in Classics, but eventually was forced by her administrative load to stop tutoring and focus on her work as college principal. Penrose was closely involved in the establishment of a university delegacy for women students in 1910, on which she served as an elected member. This delegacy led ten years later to the admission of women to full membership of the university. By 1914, under her influence, Somerville had stopped admitting students to the college who would not take the degree course, in order to build up a cohort of women students who were clearly qualified to receive degrees, a stance described as \"forward-thinking.\" Penrose had also introduced an entrance examination for students seeking to join Somerville in 1908, making it the first women's college to do so. She was responsible for adding additional tutors, including Helen Darbishire and Margaret Hayes Robinson to the Somerville staff, and enabled tutors to become part of Somerville's council for the first time in 1921."]}, {"page": "Rose Mary Crawshay Prize", "response": ["|Helen Darbishire", "|Helen Darbishire"]}, {"page": "1955 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Helen Darbishire.
