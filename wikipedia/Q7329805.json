The inquiry was held in February \u2013 March 1975 under the chairmanship of W.G. Onslow CB; it concluded that the totality of risk from hazardous industries on Canvey should be assessed.Exploratory inquiry report dated 30 April 1975 The National Archives LAB 104/610 Crosland instructed the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to undertake an assessment of the risks on Canvey. The HSE reported in June 1978. The hazardous inventory at the URL refinery was more than 125,000 m3 of hydrocarbon liquids and 3,500 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas. The URL revocation inquiry reconvened in June \u2013 July 1980 with General Sir Richard Ward as the inspector.Letter R.W.J. Wiggins to General Sir Richard Wade GBE KCB DSO MC, The National Archives AT 109/1/2 Ward concluded that the planning permission for the refinery should be allowed but only if the British Gas Corporation methane terminal on Canvey was shutdown or a source of ignition installed at its perimeter .R. Ward, 'Inquiry report \u2013 revocation', Department of the Environment E1/5215/789/1, 1980, 76. It was believed within Whitehall that in making these recommendations about the methane terminal that General Ward had exceeded his terms of reference.File note Robert Armstrong to Prime Minister Thatcher dated 11 March 1981, The National Archives PREM 19/483. Wade's recommendations gave rise to another inquiry which was held by the DoE in January \u2013 May 1982 on the discontinuance of the operation of the methane terminal under the chairmanship of Alan de Piro QC. This inquiry reported in late 1982 and concluded that the methane terminal should be allowed to continue to operate, and that the 1973 URL refinery planning permission should be allowed to stand.Inquiry report The National Archives AB 62/919 However, by this time the oil crises of 1973 and 1980 had affected the viability of the refinery and URL undertook not further work on the site."]}]}}
