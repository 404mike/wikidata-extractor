The term \"age of discovery\" has been in the historical literature and still commonly used. J.\u00a0H. Parry, calling the period alternatively as Age of Reconnaissance, argues that not only was the era one of European explorations to regions heretofore unknown to them, but that it also produced the expansion of geographical knowledge and empirical science. \"It saw also the first major victories of empirical inquiry over authority, the beginnings of that close association of science, technology, and everyday work which is an essential characteristic of the modern western world.\"Parry, J. H. (1973). The Age of Reconnaissance: Discovery, Exploration, and Settlement, 1450\u20131650. London: Cardinal. p. 13. Anthony Pagden draws on the work of Edmundo O'Gorman for the statement that \"For all Europeans, the events of October 1492 constituted a 'discovery'. Something of which they had no prior knowledge had suddenly presented itself to their gaze.\" O'Gorman argues further that the physical and geographical encounter with new territories was less important than the Europeans\u2019 effort to integrate this new knowledge into their worldview, what he calls \"the invention of America\".O\u2019Gorman, Edmundo. The Invention of America. An Inquiry into the Historical Nature of the New World and the Meaning of History. Bloomington, IN 1961, 9-47. Pagden examines the origins of the terms \"discovery\" and \"invention\". In English, \"discovery\" and its forms in the romance languages derive from \"disco-operio, meaning to uncover, to reveal, to expose to the gaze\u201d with the implicit idea that what was revealed existed previously. Few Europeans during the period of explorations used the term \"invention\" for the European encounters, with the notable exception of Martin Waldseem\u00fcller, whose map first used the term \"America\"."]}, {"page": "Francisco de Vitoria", "response": ["* Francisco de Vitoria: Political Writings, translated by Jeremy Lawrance, ed.

Over the centuries, philosophers have devoted considerable attention to the problem of hospitality.Derrida, J. (2000). \"Hospitality\".  Angelaki: Journal of Theoretical Humanities, 5(3), 3\u201318. However, hospitality offers a paradoxical situation (like language), since inclusion of those who are welcomed in the sacred law of hospitality implies that others will be rejected. Julia Kristeva alerts readers to the dangers of \"perverse hospitality\", which consists of taking advantage of the vulnerability of aliens to dispossess them.Kristeva, J. (1991). Extranjeros para nosotros mismos, trad. de X. Gispert, Barcelona, Plaza & Janes Editores (Hombre y Sociedad). Hospitality serves to reduce the tension in the process of host\u2013guest encounters, producing a liminal zone that combines curiosity about others and fear of strangers.Graburn, N. H. (1983). \"The anthropology of tourism\". Annals of tourism research, 10(1), 9\u201333. In general terms, the meaning of hospitality centres on the belief that strangers should be assisted and protected while traveling.Lashley, C. (1995). Towards an understanding of employee empowerment in hospitality services\". International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 7(1), 27\u201332. However, not all voices are in agreement with this concept. Professor Anthony Pagden describes how the concept of hospitality was historically manipulated to legitimate the conquest of Americas by imposing the right of free transit, which was conducive to the formation of the modern nation state. This suggests that hospitality is a political institution, which can be ideologically deformed to oppress others.Pagden, A. (1995).
