He defended his Dubai Duty Free Darts Masters title by seeing off Wright 11\u20137.", "His second major title of the year came at the World Grand Prix as he edged a close final against James Wade 5\u20133 in sets. Seven days later, he beat Wade once more this time 6\u20132 in the final of the 18th Players Championship. He averaged 111 in eliminating Dave Chisnall 10\u20135 in the quarter-finals of the European Championship and then threw his fourth career televised nine-darter during an 11\u20136 semi-final victory over van Barneveld. Van Gerwen took the first five legs in the final against Terry Jenkins and never looked back as he sealed his sixth PDC major title 11\u20134.

He played Gary Anderson in the event for the second year in a row and once again trailed 3\u20131 before levelling at 3\u20133. However, he missed four darts to take the next set and instead saw his reign as world champion come to end with a 6\u20133 loss. Van Gerwen won the Masters by beating van Barneveld 11\u20136 in the final with an average of 112.49. He lost in the final of the first UK Open Qualifier 6\u20131 to Adrian Lewis, but atoned for this a day later by winning the second event by beating Vincent van der Voort 6\u20133. Van Gerwen also took the third event with a 6\u20131 triumph over James Wade which meant he had won 25 of 26 matches since the World Championship. He extended this to 30 out of 31 games when he won the German Darts Championship by defeating Anderson 6\u20132 in the final with an exceptional average of 117.94.

He went on to win his first UK Open title with an 11\u20135 victory over Peter Wright in the final. He won his second European Tour event in a row at the Gibraltar Darts Trophy with a 6\u20133 success over Terry Jenkins and made it a trio of titles by seeing off John Henderson 6\u20135 at the German Darts Masters, which saw him become the second player ever to reach \u00a31 million in prize money on the PDC Order of Merit, after Phil Taylor. He reset his highest televised average record to 116.90 in a 7\u20130 whitewash of James Wade in the Premier League. Van Gerwen continued to dominate the PDC circuit by claiming the fourth and sixth Players Championship events with 6\u20131 and 6\u20135 wins over Lewis and Wade respectively. A 6\u20136 draw with Dave Chisnall ensured he would finish top of the Premier League for the third year in a row. He averaged 105.15 during the 172 legs he played during the league phase. Van Gerwen won five legs in a row from 7\u20134 down to van Barneveld in the semi-finals which helped him win 10\u20138. He could only take out 32% of his doubles in the final against Anderson, including missing seven in one leg, which contributed to him losing 11\u20137. Van Gerwen maintained his unbeaten record in the Dubai Darts Masters as he took his third title in a row by recovering from 8\u20136 down in the final against Taylor to triumph 11\u20138. He stretched his unbeaten run to 20 matches in European Tour events as he claimed the Dutch Darts Masters by whitewashing Justin Pipe 6\u20130.

Shepherd had beaten world number four Terry Jenkins, three time world finalist Peter Manley and Phil Taylor's conqueror Wayne Mardle to become the first qualifier to reach the PDC World final \u2013 but he had no answer to Part's experience in the final. The early stages of the match were close with both of the first two sets going down to a deciding leg. Part just edged the first set and in the deciding leg of the second started with 140, 180 and a 15-dart leg for a 2\u20130 lead. Part then ran off the next six legs to find himself 4\u20130 in front and missed a bullseye for a 5\u20130 lead before Shepherd took his first set. The sixth set again went to last leg with Part re-establishing a four set lead but Shepherd continued to battle away and took the seventh set with a brilliant 160 finish. Part opened the eighth set with a 139 finish, then Shepherd hit an 88 to level it before checkouts of 52 and 80 from Part took him one set away from victory at 6\u20132. The Canadian closed out victory in the ninth set with a double ten in the fifth leg."]}]}}
