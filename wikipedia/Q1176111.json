He was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 2006 to 2007, representing the Highlands and Islands region.\nPetrie was elected after Mary Scanlon stood down from Holyrood in 2006 to contest the Moray by-election triggered by the death of Margaret Ewing of the SNP. This was the result of Petrie being ranked one place behind Scanlon on the Conservative Party list for the Highlands and Islands. He had previously stood as a candidate for Argyll and Bute. Petrie did not win re-election at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election.\nAfter leaving the Scottish Parliament, Petrie taught as a part-time teacher of Mathematics at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh.
