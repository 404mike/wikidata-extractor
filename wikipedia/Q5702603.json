She states that male and female genitals were considered inherently the same in Western society until the 18th century. At that time, female genitals were regarded as incomplete male genitals, and the difference between the two was conceived as a matter of degree. In other words, there was a belief in a gradation of physical forms, or a spectrum. Scholars such as Helen King, Joan Cadden, and Michael Stolberg have criticized this interpretation of history.Helen King. 2013. The One-Sex Body on Trial: The Classical and Early Modern Evidence. Farnham: Ashgate. 978-1-4094-6335-1 Cadden notes that the \"one-sex\" model was disputed even in ancient and medieval medicine,Joan Cadden. 1993.

In reality, many practitioners of the pelvic massage were aware of the possibility of a sexual stimulation during the procedure and, like the Finnish physician Georg Asp (1834\u20131901), made it clear that the sexual excitation shall be circumvented and the clitoris studiously avoided."]}, {"page": "Agnodice", "response": ["Hyginus describes Agnodice as an obstetrix. It is difficult to know how to translate this into English. Sarah Pomeroy has rendered it as \"obstetrician\", arguing that midwives existed in Athens in Agnodice's day but that Agnodice was distinguished by her formal education in medicine. However, Helen King notes that there was no \"formal licensing system\" for medics in the ancient world, and that it is anachronistic to divide ancient healers into the distinct categories of \"midwife\" and \"obstetrician\"."]}, {"page": "William Smellie (obstetrician)", "response": ["Helen King indicated that the response of the media and the internet to Shelton's publication \"raised fresh questions about how medical history is generated, presented and evaluated in the media and, in particular, on the internet\"."]}, {"page": "Dr Helen King", "response": ["#REDIRECT Helen King (classicist)"]}, {"page": "John M.

King argues that the one-sex and two-sex models, on paper, could be a useful tool of historical enquiry but they have not been read that way. The use of these models creates a static perception of the period, damaged by arbitrary divisions of 'before' and 'after' that were not relevant to people at the time.Helen King. 2013. The One-Sex Body on Trial: The Classical and Early Modern Evidence. Farnham: Ashgate. 978-1-4094-6335-1 Stolberg provides evidence to suggest that significant two-sex understandings of anatomy existed before Laqueur claims, arguing that sexual dimorphism was accepted as early as the sixteenth century.Michael Stolberg. 2003. \"A Woman Down to her Bones. The Anatomy of Sexual Difference in the Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries.\" Isis, 94: 274-299. He discusses the influence of the uterus on medical discussion as proof that understandings of the body were noticeably 'sexed' in the 1600s. He also argues that differences between the sexes were accepted in the early modern period under the proviso that woman's biology was fit for purpose, i.e., motherhood. Joan Cadden has pointed out that 'one-sex' models of the body were already treated with scepticism in the ancient and medieval periods, and that Laqueur's periodisation of the shift from one-sex to two-sex was not as clear-cut as he made it out to be.Joan Cadden. 1993.

In 2010, however, Maine\u2019s thesis was rebutted by Helen King, and a 2018 paper by Hallie Lieberman and Eric Schatzberg dismisses this idea as false, with no more than \"circumstantial evidence that a few physicians and midwives may have practiced genital massage before the 20th century\"."]}, {"page": "History of birth control", "response": ["Historian John M. Riddle has advanced the hypothesis that women in classical antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Early Modern period used herbs to control fertility. Historian Etienne van de Walle has quoted Riddle as stating that \"most women\" in the Middle Ages knew that certain herbs and herbal products could be taken to induce an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and that this knowledge was primarily shared amongst women, thus affording them \"more control over their lives than we thought possible\".  Riddle has further hypothesised that \"these drugs were perfected over centuries in a female culture of which males\u2014who were doing the writing\u2014had only a partial and imperfect understanding\" and it is this shared folk wisdom amongst women that explains the relatively static population size in the West before the 18th century, rather than the high rate of infant mortality.  Several historians have taken issue with this hypothesis: Gary Ferngren has noted the circumstantial nature of Riddle's evidence and concluded that the ideas remained \"unproved and unlikely,\" while Helen King has written that Riddle makes claims about modern pharmacology that are not supported by his source materials. Demographer Gigi Santow has also takes issue with the proposition, writing that it overemphasizes the role of herbs and stating that Riddle seeks \"not so much to persuade as to convert.\""]}, {"page": "Gottlieb G\u00f6ttlich", "response": ["* The One-Sex Body on Trial: The Classical and Early Modern Evidence by Professor Helen King "]}, {"page": "Helen King", "response": ["Helen King may refer to:", "*Helen King (actress) (born 1972), Canadian actress", "*Helen King (police officer) (born 1965), British police officer", "*Helen King (classicist) (active since 1993), British academic", "*Helen King (oncologist) (?\u20132015), South African oncologist and anti-apartheid campaigner"]}, {"page": "Apanchomene", "response": ["Many modern scholars view this curious epithet as being related to Greek traditions where icons and puppets of a vegetation goddess would be hung in a tree (aiora).
