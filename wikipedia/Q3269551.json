In February 2013, Kirsty's husband Max Branning (Jake Wood) goes to Adam's house to find Kirsty. Kirsty has a bruise on her neck, and realising Adam caused the injury, Max punches him. Adam and another man then beat Max after locking him inside the house. In May, Adam starts calling Kirsty, as Carl is due to be released from prison. Kirsty worries that they will track her down so Max returns with his brother Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) to confront Adam again. Adam punches Max so Jack throws him to the ground and the brothers order him to stop contacting Kirsty. In August 2013, Adam attacks Kirsty, asking her for money. Carl stops Adam, who did not know Carl would be there. Carl blames Adam for Kirsty marrying Max and their mother Nora White (Lynn Farleigh) being in a care home, and Adam explains he owes money to somebody. Carl and Adam go to nightclub R&R, where Carl plans to sell drugs but they are confronted by Max and club owner Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Carl then disowns Adam and he leaves.", "Adam returns in March 2014, in search for Carl, who has since been murdered by Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), alongside his mother, Nora (Lynn Farleigh). Ronnie lies to both of them about her identity, claiming to be her sister Roxy (Rita Simons), who had been Carl's girlfriend, and says she does not know where he went. However, Adam knows she is lying as Carl had sent Adam a photo of himself and Roxy together. Adam later kidnaps Lexi Pearce, which displeases his mother. Phil and Ronnie track them down, demanding Lexi back. The Whites demand to know what happened to Carl in return for the baby. When the Mitchells are hesitant to provide an explanation, Adam loses his patience but Phil warns him off harming Lexi and takes Lexi off Adam. Nora begs them for answers and Ronnie breaks down and admits that she killed Carl, leaving a distraught Nora and Adam shocked.", "Kirsty is angry when Max continues to say he has a special connection with Tanya because they have children. Kirsty tells Max she is pregnant, and Max says he is not ready to have a child with her. They agree that she will have an abortion, but she confides in Kat that she is not really pregnant, and Max then asks Kirsty to not abort the pregnancy. Kirsty then hopes she will get pregnant, and announces to her neighbours in the pub that she is pregnant. Max then finds himself and Kirsty their own home. Kirsty worries when people ask questions about her pregnancy, and Kat urges her to tell Max the truth. Adam starts calling Kirsty, as Carl is due to be released from prison. She also starts worrying when they will track her down. Kirsty cancels an ultrasound scan appointment but lies to Max that the hospital cancelled it. Max takes her anyway and Kirsty suffers a panic attack, so she does not have a scan. Kirsty is stunned to see that Carl has arrived in Walford. She tells him she is married and pregnant, and that he should leave. However, Carl insists he will win Kirsty back. Eventually Kirsty thinks she may be pregnant, so takes a pregnancy test but bins it when Max arrives. They argue about Carl and the bin is knocked over, so Max finds the test. She admits that she was never pregnant, so Max returns to Tanya, as he was only with Kirsty because of the pregnancy. Tanya, however, refuses to take him back, and leaves Walford. Max moves into his old house. While Max is away from Walford, Kirsty and Carl visit Carl's mother, Nora White (Lynn Farleigh), because she does not know they have split up. On Max's return, Carl lets Max think he is now with Kirsty. Max tells Kirsty he could not stop thinking about her while he was away, so she suggests that they meet later, and if Max does not arrive then their relationship is over for good. Carl discovers this, so makes sure Max is busy at work and visits Kirsty at the time Max was meant to be there. The next day, Carl implies to Max that he and Kirsty had sex. Max tells people about this. She is angered by what both Max and Carl have done and rejects them both. When she confronts Max again, they passionately kiss, but are interrupted by Lauren, who has been in a rehabilitation clinic. Kirsty then puts the relationship on hold for Lauren's sake. However, Lauren convinces them to reunite, as Max is lovesick. Carl continues to interfere in Kirsty and Max's marriage, and when Max is arrested for cutting the brakes of Carl's car, he ends his relationship with Kirsty and says he is guilty. Kirsty does not believe him, and suspects Carl forced Max into this position. In desperation for money, Kirsty has sex with Carl, and then steals \u00a31000 from him. Max is then acquitted of the crime and reunites with Kirsty. However, Carl then tells Max that he had sex with Kirsty while he was in prison, and this leads to Max ending his relationship with her."]}, {"page": "Marilyn Imrie", "response": ["| Lia Williams, Roger Allam, Robert Glenister, Lynn Farleigh, Jasmine Hyde, David Rintoul and Julian Rhind-Tutt"]}, {"page": "List of Elstree Studios productions", "response": ["| Voices || Horror || Hemdale, Warden || Kevin Billington || David Hemmings, Gayle Hunnicutt, Lynn Farleigh"]}, {"page": "Screen Two", "response": ["Cast: Edita Brychta, Daniel Hill, Norman Jones, Catherine Schell, Lynn Farleigh, Roy Evans, Hana Maria Pravda, Paul Humpoletz, Gordon Faith, Richard Ireson, Roy Pattison"]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders characters (2013)", "response": ["Nora White, played Lynn Farleigh, is the mother of Carl (Daniel Coonan) and Adam White (Ben Wigzell).
