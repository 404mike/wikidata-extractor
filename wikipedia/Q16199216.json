He went on to win Australia's first world sporting title on 27 June 1876 by defeating the two-times champion, Englishman Joseph Sadler, for the World Sculling Championship, starting a Golden Age for Australian professional sculling.

A very large crowd was on hand, both on the banks and in boats, to witness the race. Trickett used a boat named \"Young Australia\" and his weight was given as 11 st 4\u00a0lbs. The race commenced just after 5:30 pm and Sadler dipped his oars first to gain a slight advantage. This advantage was soon lost as Trickett came up and passed Sadler. At Craven Point the challenger was a good length ahead and at the Crab Tree he had increased this to two lengths. Hammersmith Bridge was reached in 9 minutes 35 seconds and his lead was up to three and a half lengths. Shortly afterwards Sadler quickened and reduced the deficit to only about one length but could not make sufficient gain to pass Trickett who sculled strongly to cross the finish line some four lengths to the good. The time was 24 minutes 36 seconds. Trickett thus became the first Australian World Champion in any sport. Additionally, he collected \u00a3400 in stake money. Upon his return to Sydney, 25,000 people greeted him and he was wined and dined all around the state."]}, {"page": "Sons of the Thames", "response": ["See also Joseph Sadler Crew Races."]}, {"page": "Harry Kelley (rower)", "response": ["Kelley continued to row and on 5 November 1877 he raced Joseph Sadler over the Putney to Mortlake course for a stake of \u00a3400.

After finally retiring from competitive rowing, Kelley went on to act as a steer and trainer for a number of crews and scullers. He steered Australian Edward Trickett against Canadian Ned Hanlan during their race for the World Champion title on the Thames.

Rush declined to row anywhere but on the Clarence River, and demanded that the stakes be not less than \u00a3500. By 1875, Rush had a wife and five children to support, as well as many business commitments, and could not afford to undertake a sporting endeavour involving a major investment in time and money, unless there was a chance of an adequate financial return. Dozens of letters and articles in the Australian press debated the issuecf. Gard, Ch. 8 for nearly two years, as Trickett and his supporters became increasingly incensed at Rush's stalling. Finally, former champion sculler and now a prosperous publican and backer of sculling events, offered to finance an attempt by an Australian sculler to topple the current holder of the World Sculling Championship, Englishman Joseph Sadler.Only one other Australian sculler had attempted this feat, Richard A. W. Green, in 1863.  Rush declined to travel to London. Trickett agreed to the journey, went to the Thames, beat Sadler, and brought home the World Championship to Australia.cf. Trickett, G.
