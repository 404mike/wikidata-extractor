The arrangements and musical direction were done by Wally Stott from the third to the 10th series. Stott produced many arrangements and link passages, further improved by the first-class sound quality the BBC engineers managed to achieve. Members of the band featured prominently in the comedy proceedings, particularly jazz trombonist  George Chisholm who frequently played Scots characters.

The milk in turn was fortified with brandy.

In \"The Pam's Paper Insurance Policy\" (Series 9, Episode 4), Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, \"I wonder where he keeps that stuff!\". In \"The Scarlet Capsule\" (Series 9, Episode 14), Ellington's reply to Secombe's cry of \"Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there\" was \"The introductions he gives me...\".  In \"The Moon Show\" (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating \"Man, the excuses he makes to get to that brandy!\", causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail \"MATE!\" in protest.

Crazy People changed its name for subsequent series to The Goon Show and Geldray was a regular performer in the remaining nine series. The show followed a successful format of a vague plot interspersed by two musical performances; the BBC were using the same structure for a number of radio series, including It's That Man Again (ITMA). In The Goon Show, the musical segments were taken up by Geldray and The Ray Ellington Quartet, with Geldray also playing \"Crazy Rhythm\" for the play-out music. On occasions Geldray was given lines to perform, although he felt uncomfortable doing so, and his lack of acting ability became a long-running joke within the programme. Geldray was also the butt of some of the Goons jokes and humour: he was referred to throughout the programmes as \"Conk\", on account of his nose, and his performances were often humorously dismissed by the announcer Wallace Greenslade, with such comments as: \"That was Mr Max Geldray playing a harmonica.
