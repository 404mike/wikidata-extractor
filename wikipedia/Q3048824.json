In 1882, he became paleontologist to the \"Geologic Survey\", a position he retained until 1905. His early work included microscopic sectioning of coal and notable studies on cockroach brains.Later he did work on chimaeroid fish fossils. In 1893, Newton won the Lyell Medal. He was president of the Geologists' Association in 1896\u20131898 and president of the Palaeontographical Society from 1921 to 1928. Newton was elected Fellow of the Geological Society in 1873, Zoological Society of London in 1885, and Fellow of the Royal Society in 1893.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ornithocheirus", "response": ["Seeley did not accept Owen's position. In 1881 he designated O. simus the type species of Ornithocheirus and named a new separate species called O. bunzeli. In 1888, Edwin Tulley Newton reassigned several existing species names into Ornithocheirus, which created new combinations: O. clavirostris, O. daviesii, O. sagittirostris, O. validus, O. giganteus, O. clifti, O. diomedeus, O. nobilis, O. curtus, O. macrorhinus and O. hlavaci. He also reassigned the species O. umbrosus and O. harpyia into Ornithocheirus, which were formerly species given to the genus Pteranodon by Edward Drinker Cope back in 1872.Newton, E. T., 1888, \"On the Skull, Brain, and Auditory Organ of a new species of Pterosaurian (Scaphognathus purdoni), from the Upper Lias near Whitby, Yorkshire\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, v. 179, p. 503-537"]}, {"page": "Lyell Medal", "response": ["* 1893 Edwin Tulley Newton"]}, {"page": "Parapsicephalus", "response": ["GSM 3166 was described by Edwin Tulley Newton, who loaned it from Rev. Purdon, in 1888. He described it as a species of Scaphognathus, S. purdoni, named after Purdon; he did not include it in the type species S. crassirostris due to differences in the curvature of the top of the skull, as well as the midline channel on the top of the skull. In his description of the braincase, he noted its intermediate morphology between that of lizards and birds, which he considered evidence of a close relationship between birds, pterosaurs, and \"reptiles\". F. Plieninger subsequently compared GSM 3166 to Campylognathoides, and expressed that it was not as close to Scaphognathus as Newton had presumed. Later, in 1919, Gustav von Arthaber, based on the shape of the top of the skull, the elongated nostrils and prefrontal bones, the large antorbital fenestra and eye socket, the deep jugal, and the presence of seven teeth in the maxilla, referred GSM 3166 to the new genus Parapsicephalus."]}, {"page": "Edestus", "response": ["Edestus was first described by Joseph Leidy in 1856. The type species is Edestus vorax, the holotype specimen (ANSP 9899) is very fragmentary and of uncertain stratigraphic and geographic provenance, reported to be from Muskogee County, Oklahoma, though this has been questioned. In 1855 Edward Hitchcock presented a specimen of Edestus to the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Providence, Rhode Island the specimen (a tooth whorl) had been originally found in Parke County, Indiana. The specimen was loaned to famed British anatomist Richard Owen in 1861, who referred the specimen to Edestus and suggested that it was a fin spine.Itano, Wayne M.

The Geological Curator, 10 (1): 17 \u2013 26 Edestus minor was described in 1866 by John Strong Newberry based on AMNH FF477, a single crown that lacks most of the root from Posey County, Indiana. Edestus heinrichi was described in 1870 by Newberry and Amos Henry Worthen from a now-lost specimen found in Illinois. Edestus triserratus was described in 1904 by Edwin Tulley Newton, from GSM 31410, which was found in the Coal Measures in Staffordshire, England which is a partial tooth lacking the apex of the crown. Oliver Perry Hay in 1912 was the first to describe an associated pair of upper and lower tooth whorls (USNM V7255), found in a coal mine near Lehigh, Iowa, which he assigned to the new species Edestus mirus, now thought to be a synonym of Edestus minor. Specimens of Edestus are also known from the Moscow Basin on the Russian Platform. Edestus karpinskii was described by A.B.

The species is considered to be a nomen dubium, as it has no diagnostic features, and is considered to be a coelophysoid grade theropod outside Averostra based on the low interdental plates and possession of only a single meckelian foramen. It has alternatively been suggested to possibly represent another indeterminate predatory archosaur."]}]}}
