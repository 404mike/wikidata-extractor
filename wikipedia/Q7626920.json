Palace's South African international defender Kagisho Dikgacoi went down with a calf injury in the 15th minute and was replaced two minutes later by Stuart O'Keefe in the first substitution of the afternoon.  A counter attack from Palace midway through the first half saw Zaha holding off two Watford defenders, enabling him to pass to Owen Garvan who delayed his shot too long and allowed Lloyd Doyley to block.  The second yellow card of the afternoon was shown to Jedinak in the 28th minute after a poor challenge on Almen Abdi.  Five minutes later, Vydra's first shot on goal was blocked by Palace defender Damien Delaney, but by the end of the half the Watford striker was visibly struggling after picking up an injury.
