They were accompanied by a varying number of session musicians and some relatively consistent session players such as guitarist Ian Bairnson, arranger Andrew Powell, bassist and vocalist David Paton, drummer Stuart Elliott, and vocalists Lenny Zakatek and Chris Rainbow. Parsons was an audio engineer and producer by profession, but also a musician and a composer. A songwriter by profession, Woolfson was also a composer, a pianist, and a singer. Almost all the songs on the Project's albums are credited to \"Woolfson/Parsons\".", "Vocal duties were shared by guests to complement each song. In later years, Woolfson sang lead on many of the group's hits, including \"Time\", \"Eye in the Sky\", and \"Don't Answer Me\". The record company pressured Parsons to use him more, however Parsons preferred to use polished proficient singers; Woolfson admitted he was not in that category. In addition to Woolfson, vocalists Chris Rainbow, Lenny Zakatek, John Miles, David Paton, and Colin Blunstone are regulars. Other singers, such as Arthur Brown, Steve Harley, Gary Brooker, Dave Terry a.k.a. Elmer Gantry, Vitamin Z's Geoff Barradale, and Marmalade's Dean Ford, recorded only once or twice with the Project. Parsons sang lead on one song (\"The Raven\") through a vocoder and backing on a few others, including \"To One in Paradise\". Both of those songs appeared on Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1976). Parsons also sings a prominent counter melody on \u201cTime\u201d.", "* Lenny Zakatek \u2013 vocals (1977\u20131987)"]}, {"page": "Lynsey de Paul", "response": ["In March 1973, her first album, Surprise, was released on the MAM label. As well as writing or co-writing all of the songs on Surprise, de Paul was also the producer for all of the tracks. In his 2015 autobiography, label mate Tom Jones wrote: \"We had Lynsey de Paul, a big star, though she fell out with Gordon (Mills) for wanting to produce her own records\". Later that year, after \"All Night\", her third single, co-written with Ron Roker and released on the MAM label, failed to chart in the UK, de Paul returned to the UK Top 20 with \"Won't Somebody Dance With Me\", which was also a hit in Ireland and the Netherlands and covered in the USA. According to an interview with Michael Robson, featured in the liner notes to \"Sugar and Beyond\", de Paul had to fight hard to get this single released - indeed she would have preferred it in place of \"All Night\" and also to keep the long closing instrumental part of the song.Michael Robson, Liner notes, Sugar and Beyond, RETRO D923, RPM/Cherry Red Records, 2013 She was vindicated since it was a chart hit and she was presented with an Ivor Novello Award for the song, the first woman to do so. The BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Ed Stewart spoke the words \"May I Have The Pleasure of This Dance\" near the end of the record (he often played the record on his Junior Choice programme on Saturday mornings) although Tony Blackburn and Dave Lee Travis spoke these words when she appeared on BBC Television's Top of the Pops. De Paul performed the song on the 500th edition special on 4 October 1973,page 222, Music Week, 17 March 1979 which was the date of the release of the single.  The flip side of \"Won't Somebody Dance With Me\" was \"So Good To You\", a song covered by Lenny Zakatek on the B-side of his single \"I Gotcha Now\". \"I Gotcha Now\" was also written by de Paul, originally for Slade. In Japan, \"So Good To You\" was released as the A-side with \"Won't Somebody Dance With Me\" being relegated to the B-side. Another song co-written by de Paul, \"Today Gluggo, Tomorrow The World\", was the B-side of \"Don't You Let It Bring You Down\" by the Spencer Davis Group, as well as an album track on their 1973 Gluggo."]}, {"page": "Ammonia Avenue", "response": ["* Lenny Zakatek \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "I Robot (album)", "response": ["*Lenny Zakatek, Allan Clarke, Steve Harley, Jack Harris, Peter Straker, Jaki Whitren, Dave Townsend, the English Chorale, the New Philharmonia Chorus \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Eye in the Sky (album)", "response": ["*Lenny Zakatek - main vocal (Tracks 6 & 9)"]}, {"page": "Pyramid (The Alan Parsons Project album)", "response": ["*Dean Ford, Colin Blunstone, Lenny Zakatek, John Miles, Jack Harris \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Eve (Alan Parsons Project album)", "response": ["* Lenny Zakatek \u2013 lead vocal"]}, {"page": "The Turn of a Friendly Card", "response": ["*Lenny Zakatek \u2013 lead and backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Stereotomy", "response": ["Stereotomy marks the final appearance of David Paton on bass; he went on to join Elton John's touring band, and the first Project release since Tales of Mystery and Imagination not to feature Lenny Zakatek."]}, {"page": "Vulture Culture", "response": ["*Lenny Zakatek \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Gaudi (The Alan Parsons Project album)", "response": ["This was the final canonical Alan Parsons Project studio album, as well as vocalist Lenny Zakatek's final contribution to any Parsons album.
