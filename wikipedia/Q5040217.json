He was also the year's top try-scorer (crossing for five in the Round 5 match against Eastern Suburbs at the Raiders new home ground, Bruce Stadium) and top-point scorer, and was named as Rugby League Week's player of the year. After gaining the test captaincy that year in the absence of an injured Wally Lewis (also because of a broken arm) for the one-off test against France in Parkes and the test against New Zealand in Wellington, Meninga was duly named captain of the 1990 Kangaroos. It was his third Kangaroo Tour after being a member of 1982's \"Invincibles\", as well as being a member of the undefeated 1986 Kangaroos who became known as \"The Unbeatables\". Meninga would score the opening try of the Kangaroo Tour in the first game against his old club St Helens at Knowsley Road. After the Kangaroos' shock 19\u201312 loss in the first Ashes test against Great Britain at Wembley Stadium, Australia won the next two tests at Old Trafford and Elland Road to wrap up the series. In the second test at Old Trafford, Meninga scored one of the most famous  tries in test history. With only a couple of minutes remaining and the scores locked at 10 all, his Raiders teammate Ricky Stuart raced through a gap in the tired Lions defence and sprinted 70 metres upfield. With Lions players converging, Meninga loomed in support and after legally shouldering Lions centre Carl Gibson out of the way, received the pass from Stuart and touched down for a dramatic 14\u201310 win that silenced most of the 46,615 strong crowd. Mal then went on to score another try in the third and deciding test as Australia won 14\u20130 and retained The Ashes they had held since 1974. As he also had scored a try at Wembley, Meninga joined legendary Australian winger Ken Irvine (1963), and unlikely try scorer, Queensland and Canberra  Sam Backo (1988) as the only Australian's to score a try in each test of an Ashes series. Also in 1990, Meninga's deeds in leading the successful Kangaroo tour saw him named as Britain's BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year, the first rugby league player to win it.
