Only the transmitted radio series used the original recording; a sound-alike cover by Tim Souster was used for the LP and TV series, another arrangement by Joby Talbot was used for the 2005 film, and still another arrangement, this time by Philip Pope, was recorded to be released with the CDs of the last three radio series. Apparently, Adams chose this song for its futuristic-sounding nature, but also for the fact that it had a banjo in it, which, as Geoffrey Perkins recalls, Adams said would give an \"on the road, hitch-hiking feel\" to it.", "Because of copyright issues, the music used during the first radio series was either replaced, or in the case of the title it was re-recorded in a new arrangement. Composer Tim Souster did both duties (with Paddy Kingsland contributing music as well), and Souster's version of the theme was the version also used for the eventual television series.Simpson, MJ, Hitchhiker, page 143", "Stephen Moore recorded two novelty singles in character as Marvin, the Paranoid Android: \"Marvin\"/\"Metal Man\" and \"Reasons To Be Miserable\"/\"Marvin I Love You\". The last song has appeared on a Dr. Demento compilation. Another single featured the re-recorded \"Journey of the Sorcerer\" (arranged by Tim Souster) backed with \"Reg Nullify In Concert\" by Reg Nullify, and \"Only the End of the World Again\" by Disaster Area (including Douglas Adams on bass guitar) . These discs have since become collector's items."]}, {"page": "Nashville Skyline", "response": ["A few critics expressed some disappointment. Ed Ochs of Billboard wrote, \"the satisfied man speaks in clich\u00e9s, and blushes as if every day were Valentine's Day.\" Tim Souster of the BBC's The Listener magazine wrote, \"One can't help feeling something is missing. Isn't this idyllic country landscape too good to be true?\"Both quoted in Heylin (2003), p. 303."]}, {"page": "One of These Nights", "response": ["\"Journey of the Sorcerer\" was used as the theme music for Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series produced by the BBC in 1978 and 1979. Adams said he had wanted something that sounded \"sci-fi\" while at the same time suggestive of a traveller, so this banjo-based instrumental struck him as ideal. \"Journey of the Sorcerer\" was used subsequently for the television series in 1981 (albeit re-recorded), the sequel radio series produced by Above the Title Productions for the BBC in 2003 and 2004, and (re-recorded once again) for the film produced by Disney/Touchstone in 2005. The original version from One of These Nights was used for all original transmissions of all five radio series, and a further version was used for the sixth.  The TV adaptation of the series, and also an additional version released on LP record, used an arrangement by Tim Souster. The CD releases of radio series transmitted in 2004 and 2005 used another version arranged by Philip Pope, and recorded by a tribute band The Illegal Eagles, and the 2005 film used a version by Joby Talbot."]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Tim Souster (King's)"]}, {"page": "Third (Soft Machine album)", "response": ["We was invited by Tim Souster, who had an evening using the hall to do what he liked with.  I believe he'd heard our second LP, asked us on the strength of that.  He discovered us on the way to discovering Motown.  Via the Who, I think.  Anyway it was brave of him to invite us despite the withering contempt of the posh music establishment.  Before our bit, I went out the back for a quick fag and then the doorman didn't want to let me back in.  \"I've got to play in there\", I said.  \"You must be kidding, son\", he said, \"they only have proper music in there\".

The Heart of Gold and B Ark models were built by Perry Brahan. The small, furry creature from Alpha Centauri in episode three was a puppet designed and controlled by Jim Francis, who also built the Magrathean bubble car (also seen in episode three), and was the stunt double for Richard Vernon in the scene in which the bubble car was seen to fly. Matte paintings throughout the series were created by Jean Peyre. Music and sound effects were by Paddy Kingsland, with the exception of the theme music; the familiar Journey of the Sorcerer theme by Bernie Leadon was used again, in the arrangement by Tim Souster that had previously been used for the Hitchhiker's LP. Video effects using the Quantel system were done by Dave Jervis. Other puppets, including insects seen in episode five, were designed by Susan Moore. Some of the actual puppeteering was done by Stuart Murdoch, including operating parts of the Dish of the Day animal.", "Episode three was originally scripted to have a \"pre-credits sequence\" where Trillian announces their arrival at \"the most improbable planet that ever existed\", Magrathea, to Zaphod. This was never filmed. The arrangement of Journey of the Sorcerer by Tim Souster, used in the titles, was released as a single in the UK in January 1981.
