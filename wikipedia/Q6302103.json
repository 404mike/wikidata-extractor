His education began at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, and continued at Scotch College, Melbourne. He then returned to Adelaide, where he was employed at the warehouse of Donaldson, Andrews and Sharland, and subsequently to the Solomon Cousins \"Nimble Ninepence\" shop in Kapunda, where he developed his talent for amateur theatricals. The name comes from the proverb \"Better a nimble ninepence than a lazy shilling\", analogous to \"Small Profits and Quick Returns\" He returned to Adelaide, where he worked at the Stock Exchange. Vaiben wished to marry Mary Ann Wigzell ( \u2013 7 January 1885), a Gentile, but his father forbade the marriage, going so far as to publish a notice to that effect. Interesting that Vaiben was able to publish a riposte in the same column  In 1873 Solomon left for (perhaps sent by his father) the Northern Territory, where he became editor of the Northern Territory Times as well as holding successful mining and mercantile holdings. He helped run his brother Moss'sMoss Judah Solomon (1843\u20131933) Darwin store, then left to open his own, \"Solomon's Emporium\", which flourished while his brother's languished. He became an auctioneer in 1877, and had a business partnership with Frederick Percy Stevens and Herbert Henry Adcock in 1878. On 6 December 1880, three months after his father's death, Solomon married Wigzell, who was by then Mary Ann Bridgland, a widow with a young son; she died a little over four years later, having in the meantime had a daughter by Vaiben. Her two children were taken to Adelaide to be cared for by relatives.  He became a prominent figure in the Northern Territory, where he gained the nickname \"Black Solomon\" from the time when, on a dare, he painted himself black and walked naked (streaked?) through the streets of Palmerston (now known as Darwin). He had helped found Palmerston's first municipal council in 1874 and was later served as Chairman. He founded a building company and became quite prosperous, building for himself a residence on The Esplanade that was perhaps the grandest in the town."]}, {"page": "Adelaide Central Market", "response": ["The Market began in Grote Street in 1869 and was known as the City Markets, with its official opening by Mayor Judah Solomon on 23 January 1870.
