An overview can be found in the introduction to Doan & Prosser, Palatable Poison, which also reprints the full text of several contemporary reviews and reactions, including the Sunday Express editorial and Chief Magistrate Sir Chartres Biron's legal judgement. In the United States the book survived legal challenges in New York state and in Customs Court.A detailed discussion of the US trials can be found in Taylor, \"I Made Up My Mind\".", "thumb|right|James Douglas's editorial in the Sunday Express, 19 August 1928", "James Douglas illustrated his denunciation of The Well with a photograph of Radclyffe Hall in a silk smoking jacket and bow tie, holding a cigarette and monocle. She was also wearing a straight knee-length skirt, but later Sunday Express articles cropped the photo so tightly that it became difficult to tell she was not wearing trousers.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 185\u2013191. Hall's style of dress was not scandalous in the 1920s; short hairstyles were common, and the combination of tailored jackets and short skirts was a recognised fashion, discussed in magazines as the \"severely masculine\" look.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 114\u2013117 and passim. Some lesbians, like Hall, adopted variations of the style as a way of signalling their sexuality, but it was a code that only a few knew how to read.Langer, 45 and Elliott, 74. With the controversy over The Well of Loneliness, Hall became the public face of sexual inversion, and all women who favoured masculine fashions came under new scrutiny.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 27, 193. Lesbian journalist Evelyn Irons\u00a0\u2013 who considered Hall's style of dress \"rather effeminate\" compared to her own\u00a0\u2013 said that after the publication of The Well, truck drivers would call out on the street to any woman who wore a collar and tie: \"Oh, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall\".Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 113, 123. Some welcomed their newfound visibility: when Hall spoke at a luncheon in 1932, the audience was full of women who had imitated her look.Doan, Fashioning Sapphism, 124\u2013125. But in a study of lesbian women in Salt Lake City in the 1920s and '30s, nearly all regretted the publication of The Well because it had drawn unwanted attention to them.Bullough, 897.", "James Douglas, editor of the Sunday Express, did not agree. Douglas was a dedicated moralist, an exponent of muscular Christianity, which sought to reinvigorate the Church of England by promoting physical health and manliness. His colourfully worded editorials on subjects such as \"the flapper vote\" (that is, the extension of suffrage to women under 30) and \"modern sex novelists\" helped the Express family of papers prosper in the cutthroat circulation wars of the late 1920s. These leader articles shared the pages of the Sunday Express with gossip, murderers' confessions, and features about the love affairs of great men and women of the past.Doan & Prosser, 10\u201311; Doan, 15."]}, {"page": "1928 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 9\u201316 November \u2013 Radclyffe Hall's novel The Well of Loneliness (published on 27 July by Jonathan Cape in London) is tried and convicted on the grounds of obscenity due to its theme of lesbian love, following a campaign by James Douglas in the Sunday Express newspaper."]}, {"page": "Beverley Baxter", "response": ["In 1922 Baxter was appointed the managing editor of the Sunday Express, launched in 1918 by Beaverbrook after he had failed to acquire the Sunday Times, and loss-making for a decade; the editor there was James Douglas.
