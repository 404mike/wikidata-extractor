Despite facing not only a strong Canadian team but a capacity partisan crowd at BC Place in Vancouver, England progressed to the semifinals of the Women's World Cup for the first time in their history with another 2\u20131 win, which also marked the first semifinal appearance by any England senior team since the men reached the last four of the 1990 World Cup in Italy.

Japan then conceded a penalty as Yuki Ogimi clipped Steph Houghton and Fara Williams slotted it past Ayumi Kaihori to level the game. However, in the last minute of the game, Laura Bassett scored an own goal to send Japan through to the final. England eventually finished in third place by beating Germany 1\u20130 after extra time after a Williams penalty, their first time beating their archrivals in the women's game.
