He has spent much of his career at the University of Sussex, but also contributed to the work of international institutions, such as the World Bank's 2000/2001 World Development Report on poverty. He was reader, then professorial fellow, at the university's Institute of Development Studies 1967\u201394, and since 1994 he has been research professor at the University of Sussex's Poverty Research Unit, which he founded.Lipton was elected to the British Academy in 2006 and shared the 2012 Leontief Prize.

The inability of countries to provide adequate housing for these rural migrants is related to overurbanization, a phenomenon in which the rate of urbanization grows more rapidly than the rate of economic development, leading to high unemployment and high demand for resources. In the 1980s, this was attempted to be tackled with the urban bias theory which was promoted by Michael Lipton."]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| Windows || United Artists / Mike Lobell Productions || Gordon Willis (director); Barry Siegel (screenplay); Talia Shire, Joseph Cortese, Elizabeth Ashley, Kay Medford, Michael Lipton, Ron Ryan, Michael Gorrin, Russell Horton, Rick Petrucelli, Tony DiBenedetto, Marty Greene, Gerry Vichi || Thriller || Live action"]}, {"page": "Land reform", "response": ["* Michael Lipton, Land Reform in Developing Countries: Property rights and property wrongs, Routledge, 2009"]}, {"page": "Windows (film)", "response": ["* Michael Lipton as Dr. Marin"]}, {"page": "Urban bias", "response": ["Among the leading scholars to claim urban bias are Michael Lipton and Robert H.

Gugler suggested channeling more resources to rural areas and fighting the tendency to neglect rural areas with what economist Michael Lipton deemed \"urban bias,\" the tendency to allocate funds and public works to cities, where the elite and middle classes reside. For example, monetary policies that create artificially low prices for agricultural products harm farmers while creating a surplus for the government. Thus a reallocation of resources to agricultural workers would help shift this system that favors urban elites over the rural poor.Bradshaw, York W. \u201cOverurbanization and Underdevelopment in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Cross-National Study.\u201d Studies In Comparative International Development 20, no. 3 (September 1, 1985): 74\u2013101. Sociologists York Bradshaw and Mark Schafer studied the relationship between INGOs and overurbanization and found that state expenditures towards development were less effective than the role of INGOs. While INGOs were shown statistically to decrease overurbanization, the presence of INGOS did not decrease the effects of foreign capital investment, which is considered one of the root causes of overurbanization by dependency theorists. They and Shandra agree that INGOs can play an important role in decreasing overurbanization by supporting rural communities by promoting both economic and infrastructural development as well as the role of civic society."]}, {"page": "List of LGBT-related films of 1980", "response": ["|Windows ||  || United States || Drama, thriller|| Talia Shire, Joseph Cortese, Elizabeth Ashley, Kay Medford, Michael Gorrin, Russell Horton, Michael Lipton, Rick Petrucelli, Ron Ryan, Linda Gillen, Tony DiBenedetto, Bryce Bond, Ken Chapin, Marty Greene, Bill Handy, Robert Hodge, Kyle Scott Jackson, Pat McNamara and Gerry Vichi ||"]}, {"page": "Land Reform in Developing Countries", "response": ["Land Reform in Developing Countries: Property Rights and Property Wrongs is a 2009 book by the Leontief Prize\u2013winning economist Michael Lipton.
