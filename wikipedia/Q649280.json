Hill has been considered to be among the most distinguished poets of his generation and was called the \"greatest living poet in the English language.\" \nFrom 2010 to 2015 he held the position of Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford. Following his receiving the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in 2009 for his Collected Critical Writings, and the publication of Broken Hierarchies (Poems 1952\u20132012), Hill is recognised as one of the principal contributors to poetry and criticism in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Geoffrey Hill (1932\u20132016, E/US)"]}, {"page": "June 18", "response": ["*  1932   \u2013 Geoffrey Hill, English poet and academic (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Meades", "response": ["Preferring to be thought of as a performer rather than as a presenter, Meades has described his style as \"heavy entertainment\"; \"staged essays\" which seek to combine \"lecture hall\" and \"music hall\", Geoffrey Hill and Benny Hill."]}, {"page": "Sonnet", "response": ["Half-rhymed, unrhymed, and even unmetrical sonnets have been very popular since 1950; perhaps the best works in the genre are Seamus Heaney's Glanmore Sonnets and Clearances, both of which use half rhymes, and Geoffrey Hill's mid-period sequence \"An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture in England\".

The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up there is no way of examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem \u2013 frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons.
