He was a left-sided midfielder famous for his long attacking runs from deep positions, and powerful shot.\nBorn in Cowdenbeath, he signed for Celtic from Dunfermline on 22 November 1968 for a reported \u00a335,000. Although he scored on his debut the following day in a 4\u20130 win over Partick Thistle at Firhill, he took a long time to settle at Celtic Park and was never really accepted by the supporters. After making more than 250 appearances for Celtic, Callaghan moved on to Clydebank on 4 November 1976. He scored for his new club on his debut three days later. He left Clydebank in 1978 to become player-manager of Galway Rovers in Ireland.\nCallaghan represented the Scottish League twice and gained his first Scottish Cup winner's medal while with Dunfermline in 1968, his final season with the Fife club.\nHis brother Willie played for Dunfermline and Scotland, and his father William, maternal uncles Patrick Flannigan and David Flannigan, son Tommy Callaghan Jr nephew Willie Callaghan Jr, and grand-nephew Liam Callaghan all played football to some extent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lochore Welfare F.C.", "response": ["Other Lochore players who have stepped up include Tommy Callaghan with Celtic; Cammy Fraser, Willie Gibson, Arthur Mann, Peter Oliver and Willie Benvie at Hearts; Alec Edwards with Dunfermline and Hibernian; Ian Campbell with Cowdenbeath, Dunfermline and Brechin; Jimmy Logie with Arsenal; Chris Anderson at Blackburn Rovers; Garry Patterson with Dundee."]}, {"page": "San Antonio Thunder", "response": ["*  Tommy Callaghan (1976)"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 European Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Tommy Callaghan"]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|MF |||| Tommy Callaghan "]}, {"page": "1971\u201372 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|MF |||| Tommy Callaghan "]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|MF |||| Tommy Callaghan", "|MF |||| Tommy Callaghan"]}, {"page": "1964\u201365 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|LH |||| Tommy Callaghan"]}, {"page": "Tommy callaghan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Callaghan "]}, {"page": "1975 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||10||Tommy Callaghan"]}, {"page": "1973 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|FW ||10||Tommy Callaghan"]}, {"page": "1972 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||?||Tommy Callaghan || "]}, {"page": "1971 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||10||Tommy Callaghan"]}, {"page": "1969 Scottish League Cup Final (October)", "response": ["|RW ||||Tommy Callaghan"]}, {"page": "Willie Callaghan", "response": ["William Thomas Callaghan (born 12 February 1943 in Cowdenbeath) is a Scottish former professional footballer, who played for Dunfermline Athletic, Berwick Rangers, Cowdenbeath and Scotland.
