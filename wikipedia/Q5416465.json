The first Test of the five-match series ended in a tie, the first in the history of Test cricket.  Don Bradman remarked to Australia captain Richie Benaud, \"That is the greatest thing that's ever happened to the game\". Evelyn Wellings described the Test as \"the Greatest Test Match, the Greatest Cricket Match and surely the Greatest Game ever played with a ball\".  Despite that setback, with Benaud claiming the Australians had \"thrown away a match\", they went on to win the series 2\u20131 with one drawn Test.  Former cricketer and journalist Johnny Moyes declared the series to be \"the most wonderful cricket tour Australia has known\".   The West Indies team received acclaim for their performances, the whole series was played in a convivial manner, and the Australians, suitably impressed by Worrell, named the trophy after him."]}, {"page": "Leslie Todd", "response": ["Todd was regarded by many as being \"a nightmare to handle\", with his teammates often regarding him with \"a mixture of affection and exasperation\".Carlaw, p. 52.

They played several games on the tour against minor teams and schools, including a Christmas Eve charity match against Bill Ponford's XI which presented \u00a31,000 to a nursing charity and games against schoolboy teams in Perth, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. The radio commentators included the Australian captain Vic Richardson and Arthur Gilligan the popular England captain of the 1924\u201325 Ashes series. Gilligan's \"What do you think, Vic?\" was inevitably followed by Richardson's \"I dunno, what do you think, Arthur?\", which became an Australian catchphrase.pp97-98, Fingletonpp75-80, Kayp103, O'Reillyp81, Swanton"]}, {"page": "Richard Brooke (cricketer)", "response": ["He was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford, where he played for the school cricket team. Brooke had made his debut for Buckinghamshire in the Minor Counties Championship in 1929 against the Surrey Second XI. He later undertook studies at Oxford University. It was for Gloucestershire that he made his first-class debut for, incidentally against Oxford University Cricket Club. He batted once in this match, scoring 37 runs before being dismissed by Tuppy Owen-Smith. Immediately following this match, he made his only first-class appearance for the Free Foresters against Oxford University. Once more he batted just once in the match, scoring 27 runs before having his innings ended by Evelyn Wellings. He also took his maiden first-class wicket in this match, that of future South African Test cricketer Alan Melville. Having played against the university in 1931, he proceeded to make 2 appearances for the university in that same season, against the Army and Surrey. He played 11 further first-class matches for the university, all in 1932, with the last of them coming in the University Match against Cambridge University. A prolific batsman for the university, he scored 810 runs at an average of 45.00, with a highest score of 140. This score, one of four centuries he made, came against the Marylebone Cricket Club. With the ball, he took 9 wickets at a bowling average of 25.11, with best figures of 3/7."]}, {"page": "Wellings", "response": ["*Evelyn Wellings (1909\u20131992), English cricketer and journalist"]}, {"page": "E.
