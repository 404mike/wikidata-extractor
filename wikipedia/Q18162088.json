The five segments aired from 1:00\u00a0pm until 6:00\u00a0pm; the segmentation was later dispensed in December 2004, although the presenters still wore their respective colours for several months afterwards. They also cropped up in props used in links, such as coloured plates.", "A new strand entitled the Carrot Club was introduced in 2003, which had a female voiceover presenting where we are shown to toddlers running around and playing with toys. A new strand entitled Pic and Play was shown for the first time in June 2004, in which viewers contacted CBeebies via the website and other means to suggest programmes they would like to see. Also, in September 2005, a new strand called Bear and Butterfly launched, showing on weekend mornings. Presented by a cartoon bear (voiced by Chris Jarvis) and butterfly (voiced by Sue Monroe), and with an occasional appearance from a caterpillar, the characters interacted in an animated environment.
