Argyle faced Championship club Bristol City at Home Park on 15 July. Included in the team were three more trialists; former Millwall player Kiernan Hughes-Mason, Rochdale forward Anthony Elding and Blackburn Rovers striker Tom Hitchcock. The visitors won 3\u20132, with Hughes-Mason and Hitchcock scoring for Argyle. A team made up solely of the club's youth system played Western League side Barnstaple Town the next day. A brace from Matt Lecointe and further goals from Tyler Harvey and Ben Clarvis earned a 4\u20134 draw for the away side. Northern Irish forward Rory Patterson left the club later in the day to join Linfield on loan until the end of the season. Four new trialists joined the squad on 18 July; Argentine winger Andr\u00e9s Gurrieri, former Everton and Birmingham City youngsters Gerard Kinsella and Shane Williams, and former Preston North End player Simon Whaley, while Hughes-Mason was allowed to leave. St\u00e9phane Zubar returned to the club on 19 July after accepting the offer of a new contract.", "October began with a 2\u20130 defeat at Crawley Town. Striker Matt Tubbs scored both goals for the home side. Jamie Griffiths' loan from Ipswich Town was extended for a further month. The team threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2\u20132 with ten-man Accrington Stanley on 8 October. Simon Walton and Ladjie Soukouna scored before half-time after Sean Hessey was sent-off. Despite that, Accrington came back to earn a point thanks to goals from Kevin Long and P\u00e1draig Amond. Argyle claimed their first away win of the season a week later at Dagenham & Redbridge. Matt Lecointe and Conor Hourihane gave the club a two-goal lead before Scott Doe and Jon Nurse scored for Dagenham. Simon Walton converted a stoppage time penalty to give Argyle a 3\u20132 victory. A late goal from Raffaele De Vita gave Swindon Town a 1\u20130 win at Home Park on 22 October. A 5\u20131 defeat at Oxford United three days later was their eleventh of the season. Robert Hall and James Constable both scored twice, with Peter Leven scoring Oxford's third. Argyle were briefly level in the second half after Simon Walton converted a penalty. Jamie Griffiths was sent off as Argyle lost 2\u20131 at Cheltenham Town on 29 October. An effort on goal by Jared Sims was turned in by Cheltenham defender Steve Elliott and Argyle retained the lead for an hour before Darryl Duffy scored from the penalty spot. Griffiths was sent off two minutes later and then Duffy scored the winner in stoppage time.", "On the 2nd, Argyle hosted local Devon rivals Torquay United in front of 12,836 at Home Park, which at the time was the highest League Two attendance of the season. The Gulls scored two second half goals through Billy Bodin and Lee Mansell, meaning that Luke Young's first Argyle goal was nothing but a consolation in a 2\u20131 defeat. With the January transfer window now open, Argyle confirmed the permanent signings of Nick Chadwick and Darren Purse, who had previously only been on loan from Stockport County and Millwall respectively, as well as signing former youth goalkeeper Ollie Chenoweth from Bideford. Crewe Alexandra won all three points when Argyle travelled to Gresty Road, a brace from Luke Murphy and a penalty scored by Ashley Westwood meant that Simon Walton's penalty and Matt Lecointe's second goal of the season were once again, nothing but consolations. Conor Hourihane was sent off late on in the game for two bookable offences, which was Argyle's tenth and final red card of the season, whilst first team coach Kevin Nancekivell was sent to the stands.", "|align=\"left\"|Matt Lecointe"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["| 21|| || ST|| Matt Lecointe|| 0|| 0|| 0|| 0|| 0"]}, {"page": "Danny Sullivan (footballer)", "response": ["Sullivan attended Ivybridge Community College and played in the same Plymouth Schools side as future Plymouth Argyle professionals Tyler Harvey and Matt Lecointe in 2009.Plymouth Rout West Cornwall in Schools Cup This is Cornwall. 13 October 2009.
