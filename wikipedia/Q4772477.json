Some scholars contend that the arguments in favour of a 'general crisis' in the 17th century do not stand up under scrutiny. For example, Dutch historian Niels Steensgaard (1978) pointed out that the Dutch Republic was enjoying an economic expansion \u2013 known as the Dutch Golden Age \u2013 at the time of the alleged crisis.Steensgaard , Niels. \"The Seventeenth-Century Crisis\". In: Parker, Geoffrey; Smith, Lesley. The General Crisis of the Seventeeth Century. London: Routledge, 1978. Anthony F. Upton argued in 2001 that violent popular protests were endemic in European societies, and such violent unrest was 'generally directed at specific local problems, and did not challenge the legitimacy of the established order'. Although protests in the 1630s and 1640s 'rose to unusual levels' in some regions, Upton wrote: 'Historians have attempted to see in the wave of unrest a 'general crisis', and the debate on this continues. The main factors arguing against linkage are the reality that the disorders remained specific to local circumstances, even where they coincided in time: they did not coalesce into broader movements. Above all, the demands of the rebels did not challenge the legitimacy of the rulers, but sought restoration of customary norms (...).' Upton claimed that very few actually challenged monarchy as an institution, although many nobles preferred a different dynasty with themselves in power (for example, the Portuguese Restoration War (1640\u20131668) simply sought to replace the House of Habsburg with the House of Braganza). Almost all of the French princes leading The Fronde (1648\u20131653) were horrified by the execution of Charles I in 1649, which they regarded as regicide; unlike the majority of English rebels, they never became republicans.

Schisms between the partners began to intensify in the mid-1920s. The problematic relations between communists in Finland and those who had emigrated to Soviet Union was the main question. The socialists outside SKP criticized the Soviet-residing leadership and Comintern for excessive intervention in activities inside Finland. A pamphlet called Away with the emigrants () was published in April 1925. Conflicts escalated when the SKP adopted the uncompromising third period program of Comintern in 1928. Critical attitude to other leftist parties was now emphasized.Anthony F.
