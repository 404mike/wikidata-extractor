Standing on the northern part of the East Lawn runs a line of cedars, already in 1780 said to be of notable size. Five years after Charles William Packe (1792 \u2013 1867) inherited Prestwold in 1837, the house was largely remodelled by the defining Scottish architect William Burn. One of his earliest English commissions, it is one of the finest examples of a William Burn house in the neoclassical style. The interior of the house is noted for its exceptional marbled plaster work in the Italian style, remarkable for both the scale and the quality of the work. Within the house, there is a notable collection of twentieth century portraiture and of eighteenth century English and European furniture. Prestwold Hall passed to the Drury-Lowe family in 1936 when Penelope Mary, the daughter of Sir Edward Hussey Packe, married John Drury Boteler Drury-Lowe (1905-1960). Drury-Lowe adopted the additional surname of Packe \u2013 his son, Simon Jasper Packe-Drury-Lowe (1938-2015) inherited the house and estate either at the death of his father in 1960, or at the death of his mother in 1981."]}, {"page": "Thomas Paget (MP for South Leicestershire)", "response": ["Paget was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Southern Division of Leicestershire at a by-election in November 1867, filling the vacancy caused by the death of the Conservative Party MP Charles William Packe.
