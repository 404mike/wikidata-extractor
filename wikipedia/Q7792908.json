He was born in Richmond Terrace, Liverpool on 23 April 1864, and was the son of a naturalised Dane. He was a master printer and the senior partner in the stationery company of Jacobsen, Welch and Company, whose paper mills were at Hyde, Cheshire.In March 1916, Francis Neilson, MP for Hyde, resigned his seat. Jacobsen was chosen as Liberal candidate, and was endorsed by the Asquith led Coalition Government. He was elected at the ensuing by-election. He held the seat until the 1918 general election, when the constituency was abolished. In 1917 he was appointed as private secretary to Leo Chiozza Money, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Shipping.\nIn 1918 he contested the new seat of Stalybridge & Hyde and was defeated.\nJacobsen was a resident of Brixton in South London, and in 1919 he was elected as a member of the London County Council for Lambeth North. He was part of the Liberal-supported Progressive grouping on the council. In 1921 the MP for Southwark South East resigned, and Jacobsen was chosen by the local Liberal Progressive and Radical Association to fight the by-election. He was not opposed by the Conservative Party, but refused to describe himself as a Coalition Liberal, but as a \"Liberal supporting the Coalition Government\". The contest took place on 14 December 1921, and Jacobsen was heavily defeated by Thomas Naylor, leader of the London Labour Party.Jacobsen retired from the London County Council in 1922, and stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals at Lambeth Kennington at the 1923 general election.
