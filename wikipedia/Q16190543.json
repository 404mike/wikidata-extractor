UKIP, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all won nine seats. Of the three second-placed parties who won nine seats, UKIP gained the largest share of the county-wide vote, more than 10% ahead of the Labour party.[3] The Liberal Democrats remained as the official Opposition, despite winning fewer votes.[3] The Green Party gained two seats on the Council, despite its overall share of the vote falling. The Independent Loughton Residents Association and the Canvey Island Independent Party both returned one member and an Independent candidate representing a residents' association, was also elected. In the 2017 election, 56 Conservatives were elected, 7 Liberal Democrats, 6 Labour, 2 Canvey Island Independent party, 1 Loughton Residents Association, 1 Green and 2 independents. The independents and minor parties have since 2006 generally formed themselves into a political group, known as the Non-aligned group, and duly did so again on 9 May 2017 and 12 May 2021. The Group Leaders are Mike Mackrory (LD), Ivan Henderson (Lab) and Chris Pond (NAG). All 75 members of the Council were thus members of a political group. However, one Conservative was suspended by the national party and thus from the Annual Council Meeting of 2018 sat as an independent. In 2019, another conservative resigned and sat as an independent; she later joined the NAG."]}, {"page": "2013 Essex County Council election", "response": ["In mid 2016 deputy Labour leader Ivan Henderson (Harwich) replaced Young as leader, and Nigel Le Gresley replaced Huntman as UKIP leader group."]}, {"page": "2017 Essex County Council election", "response": ["David Finch (Hedingham) was re elected leader of the Conservative Group, Michael Mackrory (Springfield) was re elected leader of the Liberal Democratic Group, and Ivan Henderson (Harwich) was re elected leader of the Labour Group."]}, {"page": "List of MPs who lost their seat in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ivan Henderson"]}]}}
