He ruled the Blayney estate at Castleblayney, County Monaghan for fifty years from 1784 to 1834, and was one of the most illustrious soldiers ever to come from County Monaghan.\nAs commanding officer of the 89th Regiment of Foot, 'Blayney's Bloodhounds' as they were called, he fought with distinction in the Napoleonic Wars.  He was taken prisoner at the Battle of Fuengirola, when making a raid from Gibraltar into Spain against a small group of Polish soldiers a tenth his number, and was kept prisoner for four years by the French government.  His sabre is currently on exhibition in the Czartoryski Museum, in Krak\u00f3w.\nHe wrote a two-volume account of his experiences in the Napoleonic Wars - Narrative of a Forced Journey through Spain and France as a Prisoner of War in the Years 1810 to 1814, by Major-General Lord Blayney (London, 1814). He was captured by one of the O'Callaghans of Cullaville, a colonel in the French army and a prominent United Irishman who escaped after 1798. It is said he insisted on Blayney being held to ransom for some of the United Irishmen who were in British prisons.\nDuring Blayney's long incarceration, the 2nd Earl of Caledon looked after his financial, domestic, and political affairs, and on his return, Blayney was given a seat in parliament for Caledon's infamous \"rotten borough\" of Old Sarum, Wiltshire.\nLord Blayney died on 8 April 1834 and was succeeded by his son Cadwallader, the 12th and last lord.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Castleblayney", "response": ["thumb|upright|Andrew Blayney, 11th Baron Blayney", "The modern planned town \u2013 reminiscent of Plantation towns with its characteristic wide main street and with long, narrow individual gardens to the rear and out of sight \u2013 dates from c. 1830. The modern town was largely laid out under the direction of Andrew Blayney, 11th Baron Blayney (1770\u20131834), who inherited the family peerage and the large Blayney Estate as an adolescent in 1784. By about 1800 the then young Lord Blayney had ordered and implemented major reforms in Castleblayney, greatly improving the prosperity and appearance of the town. Educated in France and Germany, the 11th Lord Blayney is famous for his distinguished military career, eventually rising to the rank of Lieutenant-General, having served in the West Indies, South America, southern Africa and the Napoleonic Wars as commander of the 89th Foot, popularly known as 'Blayney's Bloodhounds'. As a peer, he was very active in the suppression of the revolt of the United Irishmen in 1798."]}, {"page": "Lt.-Gen.
