Terry (11 February 1924 \u2013 25 August 2014) was an English racing car designer and engineer, known for his work with Lotus, BRM and Eagle. He also designed chassis for many other teams, including ERA and Aston Martin and produced his own car in which he competed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Racing Motors", "response": ["The H16 was replaced by a V12 (2.9375 x 2.25 in, 74.61 x 57.15\u00a0mm) designed by Geoff Johnson. It had been intended for sports car use, but was first used in F1 by the McLaren M5A. Back at the works, the early V12 years were lean ones. In  the two-valve layout gave about  at 9,000 rpm. In 1968 this had increased to  at 9,750 rpm. Geoff Johnson updated the design by adding a four-valve head, based on the H16 485\u00a0bhp 4-valve layout; this improved the V12's power output to  at 10,500 rpm and eventually to a claimed  during 1969. In 1973, Louis Stanley claimed  at 11,750 rpm. The design and building of the first V-12 chassis, the P126 was contracted to former Lotus and Eagle designer Len Terry's Transatlantic Automotive Consultants. The cars first appeared during the 1968 Tasman Championship, powered by 2.5 litre versions of the engine, temporary team driver Bruce McLaren winning the fourth round of the series at Teretonga but being generally unimpressed with the car. BRM themselves built further examples of the Terry design, which were designated P133 and 1968 team drivers Mike Spence and Pedro Rodr\u00edguez appeared competitive in early season non championship races at Brands Hatch and Silverstone, but then Spence was killed driving the Lotus 56 turbine during qualifying at Indianapolis. Spence's replacement, Richard Attwood, finished a good second to Graham Hill's Lotus at Monaco, but after this results went downhill and the season petered out ignominiously. For 1969 the four valve per cylinder engine was developed and a new slimline car, the P139 was built. John Surtees joined as the team's lead driver backed up by Jack Oliver. Rodr\u00edguez was shunted into the semi-works Parnell team. Surtees' time at BRM was not a happy one and, despite the fact that a ground effect \"wing car\" was designed, this was never constructed and the team's performances were lacklustre.  Surtees left after a single season (1969), along with Tony Rudd who went to Lotus (initially on the road-car side), and Geoff Johnson who departed for Austin Morris."]}, {"page": "Chapman strut", "response": ["Chapman did use MacPherson struts for the front suspension of the Lotus 17. These were unsuccessful, owing to the stiction problems that Chapman had worked to avoid with the sliding drive shaft joint. A wishbone conversion kit was later developed by ex-Lotus engineer Len Terry."]}, {"page": "Graham McRae", "response": ["In 1972 McRae, Malcolm Bridgland of Malaya Garage, and car designer Len Terry built a new F5000. The car was initially designated the Leda LT27 following Terry's designs. In mid-1972 McRae and London insurance broker John Heynes bought out Bridgland and set up a United Kingdom company McRae Cars Ltd at Poole, Dorset. As from 1 July 1972 the Leda LT27 was renamed the McRae GM1. Fourteen of these cars were built between 1972 and 1973. It achieved considerable success in the British Hill Climb Championship, driven by Roy Lane."]}, {"page": "All American Racers", "response": ["The first Eagles were created after AAR entered a Goodyear-backed Lotus 38 in the 1965 Indianapolis 500 and Gurney hired former Lotus designer Len Terry to develop their own car for 1966.  The resulting Ford-powered Eagle T2G was codeveloped with the Eagle T1G for Formula 1.  After exiting Formula One in 1968 and concentrating on Champ Car, Eagle turned to sports car racing in the 1980s, partnering with Toyota to develop the Celica and later sports prototypes for the IMSA GT Championship."]}, {"page": "Lotus 30", "response": ["Notable for its curvaceous fibreglass body work and \"pickle fork\" backbone chassis first seen in the front engine Lotus Elan, On the 30 the layout was reversed and placed the engine behind the driver.  Lotus engineer Len Terry was asked by Chapman to comment on the draft concept and considered it to be so flawed he refused to have anything to do with it.  The Lotus 30 was powered by a 4.7 litre (289 c.i.) Ford V8 engine, the same type as used in the Ford GT40, mated to a 5 speed ZF syncromesh 5DS20 transaxle which was far more reliable than Colotti transaxle in 19B handling the V8 torque.  It used 13 inch wheels and solid disc brakes on each wheel.  The Lotus 30 was regarded as unsuccessful and / or dangerous but when everything was working and nothing broke, the car was incredibly fast."]}, {"page": "Lotus 17", "response": ["The Lotus 17 was a sports car racing model built by Lotus Cars in 1959. Designed by Len Terry,Setright, L.J.K., \"Lotus: The Golden Mean\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 11, p. 1227. it was built in response to the Lola Mk1 which was dominant against the previous Lotus model, the Eleven. It was replaced in 1960 by the Lotus 19.", "It was designed by Len Terry based on Chapman's ideas and it incorporated a number of new features, although in fact was the last front-engined sports racing car Lotus made.  Its rear suspension was the Chapman strut, first used on the single seat Lotus Twelve, the Elite Coupe and the Lotus 15. Its front suspension was novel for a sport-racing car as it used the Chapman-modified MacPherson strut suspension first seen on the Ford Consul in 1952, and was very light. It was Lotus's first glass fibre-bodied sports racing car (although the Works Elevens had fibreglass bodies in 1958), had a very low frontal area and the lightest weight of any multi-seat production Lotus ever made. The declared (albeit dry) weight was 340\u00a0kg (750lb). (17s nowadays struggle to get below a wet 400\u00a0kg (880lb)). It should have been a very effective weapon."]}, {"page": "Lotus 33", "response": ["The Lotus 33 was a Formula One car designed by Colin Chapman and Len Terry and built by Team Lotus.  A development of the successful Lotus 25, in the hands of Jim Clark it won 5 World Championship Grands Prix in 1965, assisting Clark to his second World Championship."]}]}}
