She completed 12 different record-breaking journeys. The records included Land's End to John o' Groats; Land's End to London; Holyhead to London; London to York, London to Edinburgh; and London to Great Yarmouth. On 12 July 1953 she covered 422 miles (679 km) in 24 hours, breaking the London to York; 12-hour, and London to Edinburgh records along the way. Two weeks later she also broke Land's End to John o' Groats. She died aged 79 when she was hit by a car while pushing her bicycle across a pedestrian road crossing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of cycling records", "response": ["* Edith Atkins set the women's road record at  on 12 July 1953."]}, {"page": "Eileen Sheridan (cyclist)", "response": ["In June 1954, Sheridan reduced Marguerite Wilson's record for Land's End to John o' Groats, from the southwestern tip of England to John o 'Groats (the northernmost part of mainland Scotland actually being Dunnet Head), to 2 days, 11 hours and 7 minutes. She rode the first 470 miles to Carlisle without a break, stopping to attach lights and change into wet weather clothing when it started to rain. The rain and high winds slowed her progress through the Scottish Borders. Despite this, her time was over 11 hours faster than Wilson's professional record, and just under seven hours quicker than the amateur record set by fellow Coventry native Edith Atkins the previous year. After reaching John O'Groats, Sheridan had a break for less than two hours, and then continued riding, as Hercules wanted her to set a new 1,000 mile record as well. After another two breaks and a meal of fried eggs and bacon, she completed the 1,000 miles in three days and one hour, smashing the women's record and finishing two hours and twenty minutes down on the record men's time."]}, {"page": "Golden Book of Cycling", "response": ["to celebrate \"the Sport and Pastime of Cycling by recording the outstanding rides, deeds and accomplishments of cyclists, officials and administrators.\" There exists only a single copy of this compendium of illuminated manuscripts.Edith Atkins page from The Golden Book", "* Edith Atkins \u2014 signed the book on 12 August 1953 "]}]}}
