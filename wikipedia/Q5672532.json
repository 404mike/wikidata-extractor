He picked up two wickets, dismissing the New Zealand captain Tom Lowry in each innings, but proved expensive: his ten overs cost him 68 runs. With the bat, Spencer made 26 and 2.\nIt was nearly three years before Spencer played first-class cricket again, and when it happened it was for Warwickshire. He played three matches for the county, but only managed one wicket in total, when he bowled his former teammate and Worcestershire opener Leslie Wright in the first innings of his first match for Warwickshire. In two subsequent games for the county, he bowled 31 overs without taking a wicket, although he was generally tidy: in his short Warwickshire career he conceded only 146 runs from 66 overs.\nIn 1954 Spencer was struck by a bus while crossing Oxford Street, London. As a result of this he died in Hammersmith at the age of 52.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Spencer", "response": ["Harry Spencer may refer to:", "*Harry Spencer (cricketer, born 1868) (1868\u20131937), English cricketer for Derbyshire", "*Harry Spencer (cricketer, born 1901) (1901\u20131954), English cricketer for Worcestershire and for Warwickshire", "*Harry Spencer (footballer) (1897-1942), New Zealand international football (soccer) player", "*Harry Spencer (rugby union) (born 1988), rugby union player"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Spencer", "response": ["* Harry Spencer (disambiguation), multiple people, including:", "**Harry Spencer (cricketer, born 1868) (1868\u20131937), cricketer for Derbyshire", "**Harry Spencer (cricketer, born 1901) (1901\u20131954), cricketer for Worcestershire and Warwickshire", "**Harry Spencer (footballer), New Zealand footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Harry Spencer (1930) : H.
