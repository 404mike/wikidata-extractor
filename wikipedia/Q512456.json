When Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) travel the desert in search of the lost R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Obi-Wan rescues them from a band of Tusken Raiders. At Obi-Wan's home, the now-found R2-D2 plays a recording of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) saying that R2-D2 contains the plans for the Galactic Empire's superweapon, the Death Star. Leia asks him to deliver R2-D2 and the plans safely to her home planet of Alderaan in order to help the Rebel Alliance. Obi-Wan reveals to Luke his secret identity and explains that he is a Jedi, a member of an ancient group of Force-sensitive warriors. He explains that the Jedi were hunted down and exterminated by the Empire with help from his former apprentice, Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), the apparent killer of Luke's father. He gives Luke his father's lightsaber and asks him to accompany him to Alderaan and take up Jedi training. Luke, at first, declines; but after finding that his aunt Beru (Shelagh Fraser) and uncle Owen (Phil Brown) have been killed by Imperial stormtroopers, he decides to go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan and train as a Jedi."]}, {"page": "R2-D2", "response": ["R2-D2 and C-3PO are then abducted by Jawas and bought by Owen (Phil Brown) and Beru Lars (Shelagh Fraser), uncle and aunt of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). While Luke cleans the sand out of R2-D2's gears, he discovers a fragment of Leia's message, and removes the droid's restraining bolt to see more; once free of the bolt, R2 claims to have no knowledge of the message. That night, R2-D2 leaves the farm to seek out Obi-Wan. When Owen and Beru are killed by Imperial stormtroopers, Luke is forced to leave Tatooine with Obi-Wan, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) on board the Millennium Falcon to deliver R2-D2 to the Rebel Alliance. On their arrival at Alderaan's co-ordinates, they are pulled in by the Death Star's tractor beam and are forced to land, but eventually rescue Princess Leia. After Vader kills Obi-Wan, the rest of the group escapes and delivers the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. R2 later serves as Luke's droid during the attack on the station. R2-D2 is severely damaged during the battle, but is repaired before the ceremony at the end of the film."]}, {"page": "Purley, London", "response": ["*Shelagh Fraser, actress, was born in Purley "]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| Star Wars (Special Edition) || 20th Century Fox / Lucasfilm || George Lucas (director/screenplay); Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Peter Cushing, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, Phil Brown, Shelagh Fraser, Jack Purvis, Alex McCrindle, Eddie Byrne, Drewe Henley, Denis Lawson, Garrick Hagon, Jack Klaff, William Hootkins, Angus MacInnes, Jeremy Sinden, Graham Ashley, Don Henderson, Richard Le Parmentier, Leslie Schofield, David Ankrum, Mark Anthony Austin, Scott Beach, Jon Berg, Doug Beswick, Paul Blake, Alfie Curtis, Peter Diamond, Steve Gawley, Joe Johnston, Rick McCallum, Grant McCune, Lorne Peterson, Shane Rimmer, Peter Sumner, Malcolm Tierney, Phil Tippett, Larry Ward, Steve 'Spaz' Williams || Sci-Fi, Fantasy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1979 in film", "response": ["| Star Wars (re-release) || 20th Century Fox / Lucasfilm || George Lucas (director/screenplay); Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Phil Brown, Shelagh Fraser, Jack Purvis, Eddie Byrne, Denis Lawson, Garrick Hagon, Don Henderson, Leslie Schofield, Richard LeParmentier, Alex McCrindle, Alfie Curtis, Peter Geddis, Michael Leader, Robert Clarke || Action, Adventure, Fantasy || Live Action "]}, {"page": "1977 in film", "response": ["| Star Wars || 20th Century Fox / Lucasfilm || George Lucas (director/screenplay); Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, James Earl Jones, David Prowse, Phil Brown, Shelagh Fraser, Jack Purvis, Eddie Byrne, Denis Lawson, Garrick Hagon, Don Henderson, Leslie Schofield, Richard LeParmentier, Alex McCrindle, Alfie Curtis, Peter Geddis, Michael Leader, Robert Clarke || Action, Adventure, Fantasy || Live Action "]}, {"page": "1920 in film", "response": ["**Shelagh Fraser, English actress (died 2000)"]}, {"page": "Skywalker family", "response": ["| Shelagh Fraser (A New Hope), Bonnie Piesse (Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith)"]}, {"page": "List of Star Wars characters", "response": ["| Shelagh Fraser (A New Hope), Bonnie Piesse (Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith and Obi-Wan Kenobi)"]}, {"page": "Doomwatch", "response": ["Cast: John Paul as Dr Spencer Quist, Simon Oates as Dr John Ridge, Joby Blanshard as Colin Bradley, David Buck as Isaac, George A.
