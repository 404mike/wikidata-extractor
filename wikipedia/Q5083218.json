Withers describes the difference as resulting from a focus on \"elements of language, and only then with their geographical or social variation, as opposed to investigation of the processes making for change in the extent of language areas.\" Peter Trudgill says, \"linguistic geography has been geographical only in the sense that it has been concerned with the spatial distribution of linguistic phenomena.\" Greater emphasis has been laid upon explanation rather than mere description of the patterns of linguistic change. That move has paralleled similar concerns in geography and language studies.Withers, C.W.J. (1984). Gaelic in Scotland 1698\u20131981: the geographical history of a language.
