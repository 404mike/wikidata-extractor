He is best remembered for scoring for Bournemouth in their 2\u20130 giantkilling win over Manchester United in the FA Cup in January 1984.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chester City F.C.", "response": ["Thanks to the signing of players including Milton Graham, John Kelly and Stuart Rimmer, and astute management of Harry McNally, Chester returned to the Third Division in 1986. Three years later they narrowly missed out on a play-off spot as McNally worked miracles on a limited budget, but further bad times lay ahead. In 1990, Chester were moved out of their Sealand Road home and temporarily shared Macclesfield's Moss Rose ground. Despite regularly attracting tiny crowds, Chester defied the odds to avoid relegation from Division Three in both 1990\u201391 and 1991\u201392. They returned to the city, the new brand new Deva Stadium in 1992 in the renamed Division Two after a Football League restructure. The first competitive match at the Deva Stadium took place on 25 August 1992 against Stockport County, with the visitors running out 2\u20131 victors. The following Saturday saw the first League game at the new home of Chester City, which saw the Blues overcome Burnley 3\u20130. The Deva Stadium is notable for being right on the England\u2013Wales border: the pitch is in Wales, but the entrance and part of the club offices are in England."]}, {"page": "Harry McNally", "response": ["When he became Chester City manager in July 1985, McNally inherited a side that had finished bottom of the Football League a year before and had needed an excellent run under Mick Speight to avoid a similar fate in 1984\u201385. Despite's Speight's success, McNally was appointed in his place amid protests from supporters. He was to soon silence his doubters, as with the help of successful new signings of David Glenn, Milton Graham and John Kelly, the Blues finished runners\u2013up in Division Four for only their second promotion since joining the Football League in 1931. Although he had to contend with the loss of key players Andy Holden and the prolific Stuart Rimmer through injury, Chester sealed promotion with three games still to play."]}, {"page": "John Kelly (footballer, born 1960)", "response": ["The son of former Tranmere Rovers manager Noel Kelly, John established himself as a stylish midfielder in the lower divisions after joining Tranmere from neighbours Cammell Laird in September 1979. In 1985\u201386 he struck up a successful partnership with fellow new signing Milton Graham at Chester City, with Kelly scoring eight times as Chester were promoted from Division Four. A year later he moved up to the second tier with Swindon Town for \u00a320,000, although he struggled to establish himself with the Wiltshire club and soon moved on to Oldham Athletic."]}, {"page": "David Glenn", "response": ["After failing to establish himself as a regular in the Blackburn side, Glenn rejected the offer of a new contract in the summer of 1985 and joined Fourth Division side Chester City. He played his first game for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with Halifax Town on 17 August 1985, alongside fellow debutants Wakeley Gage, Milton Graham and Lee Harley, in Harry McNally's first game as Chester manager. Glenn helped Chester win promotion in his first season at the club, scoring his only goal in a 3\u20132 win at Colchester United late in the season."]}, {"page": "Moturoa AFC", "response": ["AFC Bournemouth toured New Zealand and in early June played a Taranaki Invitation XI at Pukekura Park in front of 750 spectators in blustery weather and slippery conditions. At the time of the tour AFC Bournemouth had just won promotion to Football League Third Division. The AFC Bournemouth team included; Ian Leigh, John Impey, Brian Mundee, Chris Sulley, Milton Graham, Nigel Spackman, Keith Williams, Howard Goddard and Derek Dawkins. Injuries would see Bournemouth's coach Harry Redknapp and manager David Webb take the field for the English side playing its seventh game in fifteen days around the North Island. AFC Bournemouth, who scored 27 goals on the tour, had conceded only two before the match in New Plymouth, one against the Franklin County XI from Frank Verheyen and the other against Napier City Rovers scored by Graeme Hill. On Bournemouth's team list were also Brian O'Donnell, Andy Crawford, Richard Donovan, Tommy Heffernan, Phil Brignull and keeper Kenny Allen. Taranaki, playing in a gold coloured strip, won the match 2\u20131. It would be the only loss the Cherries would experience on their eight match national tour. Coached by Don Harris and assistant Chris MacIntosh, the Taranaki XI included captain Barry Cooper, Dan Hook and Wayne Gould from Moturoa-Spotswood AFC, keeper Hugh Davidson and Peter Burmester from Old Boys, Hawera's Peter Bodnar, City's Peter Dolan, Taranaki United's John Russell, Steve Lazarus, Schane Manley, Mick Mayhew and reserve keeper Wayne Martin with two guest players from Manurewa AFC, Kevin Birch and Mark Donaghue."]}, {"page": "1984 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["| || 9 || Milton Graham"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Milton Graham"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Milton Graham"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Milton Graham"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Milton Graham"]}]}}
