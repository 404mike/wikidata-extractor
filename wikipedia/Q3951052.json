In 2003, the BBC showed a documentary reconstruction of Campbell's fateful water-speed record attempt in an episode of Days That Shook the World. It featured a mixture of modern reconstruction and original film footage. All of the original colour clips were taken from a film capturing the event, Campbell at Coniston by John Lomax, a local amateur filmmaker from Wallasey, England.

The continued survival of the show depended on audiences accepting another actor in the role, despite the bold decision that the replacement would not be a Hartnell lookalike or soundalike. Lloyd later stated that Hartnell had approved of the choice, saying, \"There's only one man in England who can take over, and that's Patrick Troughton\".Howe, Stammers and Walker, p. 68 Lloyd chose Troughton because of his extensive and versatile experience as a character actor. After he was cast, Troughton considered various ways to approach the role, to differentiate his portrayal from Hartnell's amiable-yet-tetchy patriarch. Troughton's early thoughts about how he might play the Doctor included a \"tough sea captain\", and a piratical figure in blackface and turban. Doctor Who creator Sydney Newman suggested that the Doctor could be a \"cosmic hobo\" in the mould of Charlie Chaplin, and this was the interpretation eventually chosen.Howe, Stammers and Walker, pp. 68\u201369 Troughton was the first Doctor to have his face appear in the opening titles of the show.

For a time, the production team considered cancelling the story altogether and replacing it with Ian Stuart Black's The Savages, which would end up following Cotton's adventure into production. The production team's fears about the quality of The Gunfighters appeared to be borne out when the final three episodes equalled or exceeded the series' lowest Audience Appreciation scores to date. Indeed, The O.K. Corral episode, rating only 30%, would prove to be the all-time low-water mark for Doctor Who. These disastrous figures helped strengthen Lloyd's conviction that historical serials should be eliminated from Doctor Who altogether. This was not the only controversy surrounding The O.K.
