While his younger brother Tyler initially chose to become an ice hockey goaltender (though he later changed to being a soccer midfielder himself, playing for UC Irvine), Nick was interested in soccer and began playing for the youth indoor soccer club, the Cleveland Crunch. In 1991, his coach at the club, former English striker Ron Wigg, advised then PSV Eindhoven head of youth development Huub Stevens to have a look at Theslof, during a match for which PSV's reserve team had come to Cleveland. Stevens, impressed with Theslof's potential, offered him a youth contract at PSV, which Theslof accepted and moved from his home in Columbus to Eindhoven, the Netherlands. He subsequently played for PSV for the next two years, before his career abruptly ended due to an Achilles injury. He later moved back to the United States and attended UCLA, where he later played for their soccer team, where his performances were lauded.
