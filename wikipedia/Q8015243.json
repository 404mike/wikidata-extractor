Dispatches for The Times from the Crimean War, by William Howard Russell, were read in public in Hanley by Samuel Taylor, a manual worker who was a Mechanics' Institute secretary and later involved in the Staffordshire Sentinel newspaper. From the market square, Taylor moved to the town hall, and in 1856 to a fuller programme of patriotic readings, with music and the national anthem; from free admittance to a penny charge to cut down great demand. The Times made much of the events, which were widely copied in the Potteries and Staffordshire by 1857\u20138. At the Birmingham and Midland Institute, William Mattieu Williams started to give \"penny lectures\" in 1856, and C. J. Woodward later claimed that these led to \"penny classes\" and penny readings, in the cause of popular education.s:Williams, William Mattieu (DNB00)"]}]}}
