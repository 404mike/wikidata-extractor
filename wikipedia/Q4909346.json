He also won the Southern League title with Brighton & Hove Albion in the 1909\u201310 season and with Watford in 1914\u201315. His main playing position was at outside left.\nHastings was born in West Hartlepool, County Durham, and played for Spennymoor United and West Hartlepool before moving south to join Brighton & Hove Albion in the summer of 1909. He missed only one game as the club won the Southern League title and the Southern Charity Cup in his first season, and set up Charlie Webb's goal as Albion beat reigning Football League champions Aston Villa in the 1910 FA Charity Shield. He moved to Second Division club Birmingham in February 1912 for a \u00a3100 fee. He never established himself as a first-choice player, and moved back to the Southern League with Watford in 1914, with whom he again won that league's championship in the last season before the First World War. After serving in the Royal Flying Corps, Hastings returned home to play a few games for North Eastern League club Hartlepools United. He later became a referee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hastings (name)", "response": ["* Bill Hastings (censor) (born c. 1960), Chief Censor of New Zealand from 1999 to 2010", "* Bill Hastings (footballer) (born 1888), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "William Hastings", "response": ["William or Bill Hastings may refer to:", "*Bill Hastings (footballer) (1888\u2013?), English football player", "*Bill Hastings (judge) (born 1957), Canadian-born jurist who served as New Zealand's chief censor (1999\u20132010), then District Court Judge, Court Martial Judge, and Chief Justice of Kiribati."]}, {"page": "1910 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|OL ||11|| Bill Hastings"]}, {"page": "William Hastings (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Hastings (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Charlie Webb", "response": ["At the end of the 1909\u201310 season, the Times reported that \"Brighton and Hove Albion have not had much difficulty in finishing at the head of the Southern League\". Webb played in every game as Albion won their first and, as of 2018, only major title. This achievement earned them a place in the FA Charity Shield in which they faced reigning Football League champions Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge in London. The only goal of the game was scored in the second half, following a corner kick taken by Albion's Bert Longstaff. Aston Villa's goalkeeper parried the ball into a knot of players, from where Bill Hastings touched it to Webb, \"who cleverly evaded a couple of Villa defenders and found the net with a rising cross-shot.\" Crowds packed the area around Brighton railway station to welcome the victors home at 11:30\u00a0pm, and the Sussex Daily News suggested that the team could \"now be dubbed as Champions of England\".Sussex Daily News match report, 6 September 1910, cited in Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p.\u00a055.
