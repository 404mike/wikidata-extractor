Both players played in every game in the FA Cup, League Cup, and Associate Members' Cup, but each missed four Third Division matches.  Four other players made more than 40 appearances.  Four players, all members of the club's youth team, played only one game each.  Of these, Ian Docker, Ivan Haines and Lee Palmer would all go on to become regulars in the first team, but Neil Luff's single appearance as a substitute would prove to be the only game of his professional career."]}]}}
