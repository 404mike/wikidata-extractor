He then made his name playing for Mansfield Town over a six-year period from 1985 to 1991. He then transferred to Port Vale, where he finished his career following a five-year spell. Over a thirteen-year professional career he played 454 games, scoring 57 goals (claiming 45 goals in 379 appearances in the Football League). He won the Football League Trophy both with Mansfield (1987) and Port Vale (1993), and helped the \"Stags\" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division (1985\u201386) and the \"Valiants\" to win promotion out of the Second Division (1993\u201394).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gary Ford", "response": ["After making a \u00a325,000 transfer to Leicester City, he scored twice in sixteen Second Division appearances for the \"Foxes\" in 1987\u201388, before losing his place when Bryan Hamilton was replaced as manager by David Pleat. He was bought by Port Vale in December 1987 for a \u00a335,000 fee, dropping down into the Third Division to join John Rudge's \"Valiants\". He scored three goals in 28 games in 1987\u201388. However, he tore an achilles tendon in November 1988 and struggled to make the first team until he underwent an operation to correct it in September 1989. He hit eight goals in 28 games in 1988\u201389, but his injury ruled him out of the play-off Final victory over Bristol Rovers. He recovered by March 1990 and went out to Walsall on loan, making 13 appearances for John Barnwell's \"Saddlers\" as they battled unsuccessfully to avoid finishing last in the Third Division. During the 1990\u201391 season he was in action fairly frequently, scoring twice in 35 appearances, but was transferred to George Foster's Mansfield Town in March 1991, along with \u00a380,000, in exchange for Kevin Kent. After moving on to Telford United later that year he moved to Norway and plied his trade for Troms\u00f8 IL and Harstad IL. Troms\u00f8 finished sixth in the Tippeligaen in 1993 under the stewardship of Harald Aabrekk. Harstad finished fifth in the Norwegian Second Division in 1994, before winning promotion as Group 6 champions in 1995. He then returned to England and the Football League in 1995, making three appearances for Hartlepool United. He went on to work as a youth coach at York City and at York University."]}, {"page": "1993 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["|LB ||3||Kevin Kent || || "]}, {"page": "1993 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["They then needed to get past Exeter City over two legs to reach the tournament final, a team they had drawn 2\u20132 with back in September at Burslem.

Opposition manager Alan Ball said that: \"Port Vale played all the football so I am absolutely delighted that we go into the next game only one down\".
