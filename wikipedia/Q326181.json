A month later he joined Chelsea for a fee of \u00a31.5 million. He was loaned out to Milton Keynes Dons, Derby County, and Middlesbrough, winning the Championship Player of the Year for the 2014\u201315 season. Bamford then had further loans at Premier League clubs Crystal Palace, Norwich City and Burnley, but saw limited playing time.\nAfter five years at the club without making a first-team appearance, Bamford left Chelsea and returned to Middlesbrough for a fee in the region of \u00a35.5 million in January 2017. He subsequently joined Leeds United in July 2018 for a fee possibly rising to \u00a310 million, and helped the club win the Championship title during the 2019\u201320 season and gain promotion to the Premier League.\nBamford was capped by the Republic of Ireland at under-18 level before changing allegiances to England. He has represented England from under-18 to senior level, making his senior debut in September 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Patrick Bamford (born 1993), footballer"]}, {"page": "Grantham", "response": ["*Patrick Bamford (born 1993), professional footballer with Leeds United and the England national football team .

In the 72nd minute of a tight game between two teams who were essentially jostling for position in the playoffs, albeit Leeds 'mathematically' still able to gain automatic promotion, when Villa's Jonathan Kodjia was injured and remained on the ground, Tyler Roberts passed the ball up the line to Mateusz Klich who took it up the left wing and put the ball into the far corner past Jed Steer. The goal \u2013 the first of the game \u2013 sparked pandemonium, with Villa's Conor Hourihane, Ahmed Elmohamady, Neil Taylor and Leeds' Patrick Bamford caught up in a fracas with Klich at its centre, which involved several additional players from both sides and was eventually broken up by referee Stuart Attwell, Elland Road stewards and other players. In the immediate aftermath, Attwell sent off the peripherally involved Anwar El Ghazi with a straight red card (subsequently rescinded by The FA) and Bielsa's response to his players was, in the interests of fairness and after consulting with Villa boss Dean Smith, that his team should allow an unchallenged equaliser to be scored (the manager can be seen shouting \"Give the goal! Give the goal!\" from the touchline). From the restart, Albert Adomah essentially walked the ball into net unchallenged by 10 Leeds players, with only a frustrated and disbelieving Pontus Jansson giving chase and nearly dispossessing the forward. The game remained 1\u20131 and put the second automatic promotion spot mathematically out of reach for Leeds and see them enter the play-offs. Bielsa and the team were subsequently awarded the 2019 FIFA Fair Play Award on 23 September 2019, for their actions during this game, with the FIFA citation noting that \"The game finished 1\u20131, ultimately allowing their promotion rivals Sheffield United to guarantee their automatic spot in the Premier League, at Leeds\u2019 expense.
