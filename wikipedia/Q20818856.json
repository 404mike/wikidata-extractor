He scored 25 goals from 224 appearances in the Football League playing for Woolwich Arsenal and Fulham before the First World War and for Darlington and Crewe Alexandra after it.\nWinship began his football career with junior clubs in the area local to his native Newcastle upon Tyne. He played in the North-Eastern League for Wallsend Park Villa before joining Football League First Division club Woolwich Arsenal in late 1910. He made nearly 30 first-team appearances in a little over two years, then spent the last few weeks of the 1912\u201313 season with Fulham before returning to Arsenal, by then a Second Division team. In the two seasons before the Football League was suspended for the duration of the First World War, he took his appearance total to 56 matches, and then returned to the north-east where he worked in shipbuilding before serving in the Royal Engineers.\nAfter the war, he played for Hartlepools United in the Northern Victory League, then helped Darlington reach runners-up spot in the 1919\u201320 North-Eastern League and win the title the following year. Darlington were elected to the newly formed Northern Section of the Third Division in 1921, and Winship contributed to their second-place finish in their first season and their Northern Section title in 1924\u201325. Before Winship could represent Darlington in Second Division football, they had to pay \u00a3100 to Arsenal to transfer his registration, which that club had retained. He was not a regular at the higher level, but still took his total of league appearances for Darlington to nearly 150 over five seasons. He then spent one last season in the Football League with Third Division Crewe Alexandra before returning to his native north-east of England where he played at non-League level for a further three years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bill Hooper (English footballer)", "response": ["Hooper played for Cockfield and for Darlington club Rise Carr before the First World War interrupted his progress. After the war, he played five times for First Division club Oldham Athletic, where his older brother Danny was also on the books. He then returned home and signed for Darlington. He and Tommy Winship were instrumental in Darlington finishing as runners-up in the North Eastern League, which led to their inclusion in the newly formed Football League Third Division North."]}, {"page": "Hughie Dickson", "response": ["Dickson was born in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, in 1895. He played for Gainsborough Trinity and for Worksop Town before joining Darlington when the club re-formed after the First World War. By January 1920, Dickson was part of a Darlington half-back line\u00a0\u2013 the others being George Malcolm and Percy Sutcliffe\u00a0\u2013 who, according to the Daily Express ahead of their FA Cup tie with Second Division Birmingham, had acquired \"a reputation for upsetting opponents' designs\". In the event, they could not upset Birmingham's designs: Tommy Winship missed a penalty, and Darlington lost 4\u20130. Dickson and right-back Arthur Golightly were their most \"conspicuous\" players, though both \"perceptibly tired under pressure\" towards the end of the game. In February, he was one of two Darlington players selected for the North Eastern League representative team to face the Central League. He helped Darlington win the North Eastern League title in 1920\u201321, after which the club was elected to the Football League's newly formed Third Division Northern Section."]}, {"page": "List of Darlington F.C. players", "response": ["Other players took part in significant matches in the history of the club. On the opening day of the 1921\u201322 season, Tommy Winship crossed for Bill Hooper to score Darlington's first Football League goal, against Halifax Town; the goal came so quickly that the Northern Echo reported how Hooper could \"in all probability, lay claim to the honour of being the first player to score a goal in the Northern Section of the Third Division\". Hughie Dickson scored the second with a penalty kick to make the score 2\u20130, and George Malcolm, the club's first Football League captain, and Tommy Greaves also played in the match. Dan Cassidy scored the last-seconds winner to defeat Stockport County in the inaugural Northern Section Cup final in 1934. Dave Carr and Keith Morton scored two of the goals that earned Darlington a draw with Chelsea, League champions only three seasons earlier, in the fourth round of the 1958\u201359 FA Cup, and Carr scored again as Darlington won the replay 4\u20131 to progress to the last 16 of the competition for only the second time in their history. Ray Yeoman captained the team to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1965\u201366, and Ian Miller was captain and Paul Arnison, Liam Hatch and Sam Russell also played as Darlington won the 2011 FA Trophy Final."]}, {"page": "Wee Winship", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Winship"]}, {"page": "Tom Winship", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Winship"]}, {"page": "Bill Laverick", "response": ["Laverick was born in Pelton Fell, County Durham, and played football for his village club before the First World War.

He crossed for Dick Healey's opening goal in a 2\u20132 draw, but Tommy Winship returned to the team for the replay. He continued his tour of the North-Eastern League with two seasons at Chester-le-Street Town, for whom he scored regularly and attracted interest from a variety of clubs from the Football League.
