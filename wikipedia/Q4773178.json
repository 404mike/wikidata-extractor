He is known for his collaborative way of writing and workshopping his plays. Much of his work is characterised by the exploration of sex and violence. \nNeilson has been cited as a key figure of In-yer-face theatre, a term used to characterise new plays with a confrontational style and sensibility that emerged in British theatre during the 1990s. He has been credited with coining the phrase \"in-your-face theatre\" but has rejected the label and instead describes his work as \u201c'experiential' theatre\u201d.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Tell-Tale Heart", "response": ["* In December 2018, Anthony Neilson's stage adaptation was presented at London's National Theatre."]}, {"page": "Sarah Kane", "response": ["Kane's agent, Mel Kenyon, stated that \"I don't think she was depressed, It was deeper than that.

Neilson suggested that Kane's depression was the result of \"crazy and irregular tides of chemicals that crash through the brain\" and that \"Far from enhancing talent these neurological storms waste time, narrow vision and frequently lead, as here, to that most tragic, most selfish actions\"."]}, {"page": "Peter K\u00fcrten", "response": ["* The 2009 film Normal is based on the crimes of Peter K\u00fcrten.

Brown described himself as \"a risk-taker; I had a taste for doing plays that are a bit between-the-eyes: most London theatres didn't dare put on Brad Fraser['s plays] because of the explicit sex\". Fraser has been hailed by director Dominic Dromgoole as \"the early prophet, the John the Baptist of the brutalist school that flourished in the mid-nineties. A lot of tricks that tired by the end of the Nineties, the rimming, the sadism, the antibodies, the sexual frankness, the cool irony in the face of outrage, began with Fraser\". Brown also developed \"Scottish work with Scottish actors\" such as the \"provocative\" 1992 play The Life of Stuff written by \"local actor\" Simon Donald. Sierz has said that Brown unknowingly was \"opening the long road that led to Anthony Neilson, to Mark Ravenhill (who was influenced by the work of Canadian Brad Fraser) and to that 1990s youth anthem, Trainspotting\".

Of Dohan's work in the Neilson play, The New York Times wrote \"With an actress as extremely gorgeous as Meital Dohan and a script that requires her to thrash around in ways most often seen in straight-to-video steamers, you would think that Stitching would be heating up the Wild Project theater to the boiling point.\" They found that it did not, blaming the Neilson script for working \"so hard at being gimmicky that it doesn't give Ms. Dohan and her co-star, Gian Murray Gianino, a chance to find real chemistry.
