Bruce was primarily a railway engineer who worked for many railway companies in Britain, Europe, Asia and South America.  He was closely involved with the Institution of Civil Engineers, serving at various times as a member, council member, vice-president and president.  He received a knighthood from the British Government and was made an officer of the Legion of Honour by the French in recognition of his services to construction.  Bruce was a Presbyterian and committed himself to spreading the church in England and to improve public education, to which end he gave his time and money generously.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Highgate Cemetery", "response": ["* George Barclay Bruce, world renown railway engineer and president of the Institution of Civil Engineers"]}, {"page": "Royal Border Bridge", "response": ["On 15 May 1847, the foundation stone for what would become the Royal Border Bridge, which was then simply referred to as the Tweed Viaduct, was laid. The Cumberland-based construction firm McKay & Blackstock were appointed to built the structure, while the civil engineer George Barclay Bruce, a former apprentice of Stephenson's, was selected to serve as the resident engineer, being responsible overseeing the day-to-day work at the site. Reportedly, the construction of the Royal Border Bridge consumed 8 million cubic feet (227,000 cubic metres) of stone; the inner part of the arches alone required 2.5 million bricks. Many of the same techniques that had been employed in the construction of Newcastle's High Level Bridge were shared with this structure as well. At the height of construction activity, the workforce is believed to have involved upwards of 2,700 men."]}, {"page": "Alston line", "response": ["The line ran from a bay platform at Haltwhistle, where it met with the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway. From Haltwhistle, the line diverged south towards the Alston Arches Viaduct over the River South Tyne.

It is a particularly elegant example of Victorian engineering: the river is crossed by nine  wide arches which support a deck at least  above the river but, as it carried a single rail track, only  wide. The piers to the arches are built of massive rough-faced stones each weighing up to , with similar-sized stones in ashlar to the main arch voussoirs. The spandrels and piers to the  wide approach arches are built of coursed rubble masonry."]}, {"page": "Alston Arches Viaduct", "response": ["The bridge, which has four stone arches, was designed by Sir George Barclay Bruce as a railway bridge."]}, {"page": "Rio Tinto Pier (Huelva, Spain)", "response": ["The pier was designed by the engineers, Sir George Barclay Bruce and Thomas Gibson and was constructed between 1874 and 1876. Both had already had considerable experience of railway and dock construction, including in Madras in India.  It had two platforms. Ore-bearing trains ran on the upper platform and general goods trains to import supplies for the mine ran on the lower platform. There are many structural elements, some of which were added at a later stage to repair and reinforce sections of the dock. A characteristic that distinguishes this pier from the others of its time is that its foundation is on wooden platforms at the bottom of the estuary."]}]}}
