Royal Marine Colonel Hugh Montgomery of the Department of Naval Intelligence, was also seconded to Romer's intelligence staff at this time.  British Army after-action reports and contemporary accounts indicate that M04(x)/DDSB was considered a highly amateurish outfit.  Serious cover constraints, coupled with alcohol abuse and social fraternisation with local prostitutes would prove to be the downfall of several of these amateur sleuths.  Despite these failings, it was not MI5, but one of Basil Thomson's agents, John Charles Byrnes, a double agent within the IRA, who identified Michael Collins, and came close to arranging his capture.  Byrnes was discovered as a British spy and executed by the IRA in March 1920."]}, {"page": "Bloody Sunday (1920)", "response": ["Early on the morning of 21 November, the IRA teams mounted the operation. Most of the assassinations occurred within a small middle-class area of south inner-city Dublin, with the exception of two shootings at the Gresham Hotel on Sackville Street (now O'Connell Street). At 28 Upper Pembroke Street, six British Army officers were shot. Two Intelligence officers were killed outright, a fourth (Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Montgomery) died of his wounds on 10 December, while the rest survived. Another successful attack took place at 38 Upper Mount Street, where another two Intelligence officers were killed. A British Army dispatch rider stumbled upon the operation on Upper Mount Street and was held at gunpoint by the IRA. As they left the scene they exchanged fire with a British major who had spotted them from a nearby house.", "*Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Montgomery (British Army Staff Officer) \u2013 Pembroke Street (died on 10 December)"]}, {"page": "Brompton Cemetery", "response": ["* Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Montgomery \u2013 Royal Marines and intelligence officer, one of the IRA-assassinated Cairo Gang"]}, {"page": "Cairo Gang", "response": ["Three more members of the Gang were shot in the same house: Captain Brian Christopher Headlam Keenlyside, Colonel Wilfrid Woodcock, and Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Montgomery. Woodcock was not connected with intelligence and had walked into a confrontation on the first floor of the Pembroke Street house as he was preparing to leave to command a regimental parade at army headquarters. He was in his military uniform and, when he shouted to warn the other five British officers living in the house, he was shot in the shoulder and back, but survived. As Keenlyside was about to be shot, a struggle ensued between his wife and Mick O'Hanlon. The leader of the unit, Mick Flanagan, arrived, pushed Mrs Keenlyside out of the way and shot her husband.", "A listing in The Times of killed and wounded notes that, in addition to Caldow, Captain Brian Keenlyside, Colonel Hugh Montgomery, Major (Wilfrid) Woodcock, and Lieutenant Randolph Murray were wounded, but not killed.
