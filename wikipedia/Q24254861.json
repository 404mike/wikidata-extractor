Byron later described her as \"that dangerous thing, a female wit\", and remarked that she had \"a great disregard of received notion in her conversation as well as conduct\". From Athens, Stanhope's party travelled on to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), capital of the Ottoman Empire.

Byron by this time was in Italy, but the overlap with Byron's friends was considerable: both Hobhouse and Kinnaird also belonged, and the three campaigned for Burdett in 1819, at personal cost.
