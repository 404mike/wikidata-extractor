Historians have rejected Menzies' theories and assertions and have categorised his work as pseudohistory.He was best known for his controversial book 1421: The Year China Discovered the World, in which he asserts that the fleets of Chinese Admiral Zheng He visited the Americas prior to European explorer Christopher Columbus in 1492, and that the same fleet circumnavigated the globe a century before the expedition of Ferdinand Magellan. Menzies' second book, 1434: The Year a Magnificent Chinese Fleet Sailed to Italy and Ignited the Renaissance, extended his discovery hypothesis to the European continent. In his third book, The Lost Empire of Atlantis, Menzies claims that Atlantis did exist, in the form of the Minoan civilization, and that it maintained a global seaborne empire extending to the shores of America and India, millennia before actual contact in the Age of Discovery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Out-of-place artifact", "response": ["* Piri Reis map: Several authors, and others such as Gavin Menzies and Charles Hapgood, have suggested that this map, compiled by the Turkish admiral Piri Reis, shows Antarctica long before it was discovered (cf.

On the Piri Reis map, the latter is shown bending off sharply to the east starting around present-day Rio de Janeiro. Another interpretation of this territory has been to identify this section with the Queen Maud Land coast of Antarctica. This claim is generally traced to Arlington H. Mallery, a civil engineer and amateur archaeologist who was a supporter of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact hypotheses. Though his assertions were not well received by scholars, they were revived in Charles Hapgood's 1966 book Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings. This book proposed a theory of global exploration by a pre-classical undiscovered civilisation based on his analysis of this and other ancient and late-medieval maps. More notoriously, these claims were repeated in Erich von D\u00e4niken's Chariots of the Gods? (which attributed the knowledge of the coast to extraterrestrials) and Gavin Menzies's 1421: The Year China Discovered the World (which attributed it to supposed Chinese voyages), both of which were roundly denounced by mainstream scholars."]}, {"page": "1421: the Year China Discovered the New World", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gavin Menzies"]}, {"page": "Mahogany Ship", "response": ["In 2002 English writer Gavin Menzies speculated that the ship was a modified Chinese junk.

(Bill) Richardson was former reader in Portuguese and Spanish at Flinders University, South Australia. Since 1983 Richardson has written more than 20 articles on the \"Jave La Grande\" question for academic journals. Richardson has also criticized Gavin Menzies assertion the Dieppe maps provide clues as to a possible Chinese discovery of Australia. In 2007 he also criticized Trickett's book. In 2006 his book Was Australia charted before 1606? The Jave La Grande inscriptions  was published. Richardson devotes much of this book to considering the \"Jave La Grande\" connection to Australia and in particular the information that toponymy (the study of placenames) can provide in identification. His conclusion is that \"Jave La Grande\" is unmistakably connected to the coast of south-west Java and  the southern coast of Vietnam.Richardson, W.A.R.(2006) p.93 A difficulty with the explanation put forward by Richardson is that, as he acknowledges, there is no surviving Portuguese chart that bears \"an immediately obvious resemblance\" to either the west coast of Jave la Grande south of R: Grande or to its east coast. He therefore suggests that the Portuguese charts that he says were the source for the Dieppe mapmakers \"could well have been captured at sea\" by French pirates or privateers, or possibly taken by \"one of the renegade Portuguese who went to work abroad\" to France, where they came into the hands of the Dieppe cartographers.Richardson, W.A.R.(2006) pp. 91\u201392.
