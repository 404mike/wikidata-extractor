He was selected to play for England as Graham Gooch's opening partner on tours of Australia and the West Indies. Although a talented player, Larkins is considered as something of an underachiever at the top level. County bowlers such as Jonathan Agnew spoke of being \"Nedded\" when he performed well against them. The cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, opined, \"Larkins was usually ignored when he should have been selected and selected when he should have been ignored in a career of unfulfilled potential. A destructive opening bat who could demolish any attack if he got going, 'Ned' tired of waiting for England and joined the 1982 rebel tour to South Africa\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Botham", "response": ["Botham retired from cricket midway through the 1993 season, his last match being for Durham against the visiting Australians at The Racecourse 17\u201319 July 1993.

In reply, Australia could only make 221, thanks to Simon Brown who took seven for 70 (Botham none for 21). Being 164 behind, Australia had to follow on and a victory for Durham was possible but centuries by Matthew Hayden and David Boon saved Australia and the match was drawn. Botham's final bowling return was none for 45 from eleven overs. In the final over of the game, Botham also kept wicket, without wearing gloves or pads."]}, {"page": "November 22", "response": ["*1953 \u2013 Wayne Larkins, English cricketer and footballer"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left\" | Wayne Larkins"]}, {"page": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Wayne Larkins || 20,317", "Subsequently, the club has seen mixed fortunes.

The squad was weakened by the absence of a number of players from the previous Ashes series who had become ineligible for selection; Graham Gooch, Geoff Boycott, John Emburey, Mike Hendrick, Alan Knott, Wayne Larkins, Chris Old, Peter Willey and Bob Woolmer were serving three-year bans from international cricket due to their participation in the rebel tour to South Africa. Somewhat more controversial was the omission of available players like Mike Gatting, Trevor Jesty, Graham Dilley and Phil Edmonds; Gatting and Edmonds had played pivotal roles in Middlesex' county championship success, Gatting scoring over 1600 runs at an average of nearly 59, as well as contributing 21 wickets, and Edmonds taking 80 wickets.
