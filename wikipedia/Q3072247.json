Born Simon Parry in Anglesey, Wales, he moved to London in the late 1990s. Parry had grown interested in antifolk after hearing Beck's Stereopathic Soulmanure album (1994). However, it was only after a trip to New York's Sidewalk Cafe (where Beck had first come to prominence) in 2001 that he thought a similar movement should be created in London.\nSimilar to Lach, the New York-based musician/promoter who first started booking 'antifolk' shows at various venues in New York City after finding himself unwelcome at more traditional venues, Parry founded a similar movement in London in 2002, taking the stagename Filthy Pedro. He created the antifolk.co.uk website and soon after started a seasonal gig in London -- 'The Antifolk UK Fest' -- where unusual and like-minded songwriters could perform outside of the generic indie/rock scene. The 'antifolk movement' and its unorthodox practices (often booking people on its shows with a low level of musical competence), started to attract some press attention in 2006, with Filthy Pedro a key interviewee.\nThe movement has been championed by Nude Magazine, Time Out London and Everett True of Plan B Magazine and The Village Voice. Filthy Pedro has appeared on Channel 4's Transmission programme (which borrowed the idea from his song 'Rock N Roll Points' as an interview technique), was recommended by Lauren Laverne in the NME and in 2007 performed live on Marc Riley's BBC6 radio show following the launch of his first single.\nFilthy Pedro often performs with a band, The Carthaginians, which is composed of Thee Intolerable Kidd (Nathaniel Kidd), Claudius T. Skull (Tim Tomlinson), Cigarface (Jack Medley), Penny O, Krakatoa Kate, and Disco Stu (Stuart Saunderson of David Cronenberg's Wife). Many songs humorously combine themes of (usually ancient) history with more modern examples of heavy drinking, drugs and sex: \"Man, I'm Old\", \"History Lover\" and \"Talking About Caesar\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anti-folk", "response": ["In the 2000s, the term was adopted in Britain, particularly in the London underground scene, with acts including David Cronenberg's Wife and The Bobby McGee's. The UK anti-folk scene, largely centred in London and Brighton, has established its own identity, which has been written about in a six-page feature in the September 2007 issue of Plan B magazine. In 2004, the lo-fi musician Filthy Pedro started seasonal anti-folk festivals, which he promoted with Tom Mayne of the band David Cronenberg's Wife."]}, {"page": "Lach", "response": ["September 18, 2001 saw the domestic release of Kids Fly Free, again produced by Richard Barone with a 16-page lyric booklet illustrated by Daniel Johnston. Tours of the UK by Lach and other NYC anti-folkers such as The Moldy Peaches, Hamell On Trial and Jeffrey Lewis sparked the beginnings of the UK scene, inspiring such British artists as Milk Kan, Filthy Pedro, David Cronberg's Wife, Sgt. Joe Buzzfuzz and Laura Marling. The 12 Bar Club began hosting monthly anti-folk nights called Blang!"]}, {"page": "12 Bar Club", "response": ["The venue was known for supporting independent promoters and less mainstream styles of music, notably hardcore punk and antifolk - the seasonal antifolk (UK) fest was held at the 12 Bar and many 'antifolk' style performers from both New York and England have played there, including Langhorne Slim, Jeffrey Lewis, Major Matt Mason, Curtis Eller, Thomas Truax, and Filthy Pedro, either at the fests themselves or like-minded nights such as Joe 'Sgt Buzfuz' Murphy's monthly 'Blang' night. Also, early in their career, The Libertines played at the venue."]}, {"page": "New York Antifolk Festival", "response": ["The anti-folk movement and the New York Antifolk Festival have spawned a number of other festivals around the world.  Filthy Pedro started the Antifolk UK Fest after a visit to the SideWalk Cafe.  Other festivals include the Anti-anti-folk festival in Brixton, and the Kentucky Anti-folk festival, as well as several festivals in Berlin such as the Down by the River Festival."]}, {"page": "Sergeant Buzfuz", "response": ["In 2002, Murphy began promoting a monthly night named Blang at London's 12 Bar Club where he regularly put on acts from the New York anti-folk scene. Blang became the hub for British anti-folk music. Murphy continued to promote his Blang nights at the 12 Bar Club until 2012, ending on the ten year anniversary. The early Sergeant Buzfuz records were released on his own Audio Gland label. In 2005 he launched a new Blang label with the Fruit Machine compilation of acts who had played at the live nights. Subsequent Sergeant Buzfuz records have all been released on Blang, which he co-runs with Jules Dakin (AKA JJ Crash of the band Lucy's Diary). The label has released records by many acts including David Cronenberg's Wife, Filthy Pedro, Milk Kan, Thomas Truax,  Sheepy, Lucy's Diary and Thee Cee Cees, whose singer Chris T-T originally advised Joe Murphy on how to set up a record label and recorded parts of Obsessive Compulsion Pour Homme in his bedroom back in 1999."]}]}}
