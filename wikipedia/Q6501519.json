He made more than 300 appearances in the Football League, playing either at centre half or in the forward line for Darlington, Northampton Town, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Norwich City and Bradford Park Avenue. He was an England amateur international and captained Great Britain at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

He was sacked in a blaze of publicity in July 1977, and was replaced at Old Trafford by Dave Sexton, the same man who had replaced him at Chelsea. The affair also resulted in the end of his marriage to Agnes, who had been his wife since December 1949. In 1988 Docherty married Mary, and the couple remained together until his death in 2020. After his sacking, Docherty had a frosty relationship with the club."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C.

When Docherty refused to resign, the board dismissed him. While Docherty's affair had been disruptive to the club, it was not a legally valid reason to dismiss someone, and so the board stated that he had been dismissed for abusing his position in order to obtain tickets for the two cup finals, and selling them for a profit. Despite this, it was well known why Docherty had been sacked, and there were suggestions he would sue the club for wrongful dismissal. However, Docherty never did so."]}, {"page": "North London derby", "response": ["Due to the rivalry between the clubs, relatively few players have played for both Arsenal and Tottenham since 1913. The first player to have played for both clubs, however, predated the start of the rivalry; Bill Julian joined Royal Arsenal in 1889 and Tottenham in 1894. Many other players played for both clubs before the start of the rivalry, including Charles Ambler, Arthur Elliott, Thomas Fitchie, Tom Pratt, Peter Kyle, and George Payne. A number of players had joined both clubs in the 20th century, but it was only in the 1960s that Laurie Brown became the first player to have played in the North London Derby for both clubs. The players who have played for both since 1919 when the rivalry escalated are listed below.", "|align=left|Laurie Brown||DF", "|align=left|Laurie Brown"]}, {"page": "Laurie Brown", "response": ["Laurie Brown may refer to:", "* Laurie Brown (bishop) (1907\u20131993), British Anglican bishop; Bishop of Warrington and of Birmingham", "* Laurie Brown (physicist) (born 1923), American theoretical physicist", "* Laurie Brown (footballer) (1937\u20131998), British footballer and manager", "* Laurie Brown (broadcaster) (born 1957), Canadian television host", "* Laurie Brown (photographer), (born 1978), American photographer"]}, {"page": "Laurie Brown (UK football)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Laurie Brown (footballer)"]}]}}
