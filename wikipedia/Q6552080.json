She is best known for her work on religious change since the 1980s, and for initiating public debates about faith. She has been described by Matthew Taylor, head of the Royal Society of Arts, as \"one of the world's leading experts on religion\".Since 2022, Woodhead has been the FD Maurice Professor and Head of the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at King's College London. Prior to this, she was Professor of Sociology of Religion in the Department of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University from 2006 to 2021. Furthermore, from 2007 to 2012, she was director of the AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Programme.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Age", "response": ["The scholar of religion Wouter Hanegraaff adopted a different approach by asserting that \"New Age\" was \"a label attached indiscriminately to whatever seems to fit it\" and that as a result it \"means very different things to different people\". He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered \"a unified ideology or Weltanschauung\", although he believed that it could be considered a \"more or less unified 'movement'.\" Other scholars have suggested that the New Age is too diverse to be a singular movement. The scholar of religion George D. Chryssides called it \"a counter-cultural Zeitgeist\", while the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was a milieu; Heelas and scholar of religion Linda Woodhead called it the \"holistic milieu\"."]}, {"page": "Peter L.

When theologians of this medieval period circumscribed the seven sacraments, they changed the vocabulary and gave the sacraments exclusively to male priests. In the nineteenth century, rights for women brought a wide variety of responses from Christian ethics with the Bible featuring prominently on both sides ranging from traditional to feminist.

The following New Testament passages and more recent theological beliefs have contributed to the interpretation of roles of women in Christianity through the centuries:", "Christian leaders throughout history have been patriarchal, taking names that underscore male leadership in the church. These include \"father\", \"'abbot' (abba = father)\", and \"'pope' (papa = father)\". Linda Woodhead notes that \"Such language ... excludes women from the exercise of such roles\". She also notes a sentiment in 1 Corinthians which \"exemplif[ies] a pattern of Christianity of all varieties\", where Paul \"explains that women should be veiled in the church to signal their subordination to men because \u2018the head of every man is Christ and the head of a woman is her husband\u2019, and that \u2018women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak but should be subordinate, as even the law says.'\u201d", "Linda Woodhead states that, \"Of the many threats that Christianity has to face in modern times, gender equality is one of the most serious\". Some 19th-century Christian authorsFor example, Katharine Bushnell, L.A. Starr, Charles H. Pridgeon, Phoebe Palmer, A. J. Gordon, Frances Willard, and many others began codifying challenges to traditional views toward women both in the church and in society. Only since the 1970s have more diverse views become formalized.  In addition to non-Christian perspectives, four of the primary views inside Christianity on the role of women are Christian feminism, Christian egalitarianism, complementarianism, and Biblical patriarchy.", "Linda Woodhead claims that the modern \"egalitarian emphasis is contradicted by a symbolic framework that elevates the male over the female, and by organizational arrangements that make masculine domination a reality in church life. Theological statements on the position of women from down the centuries testify not only to the assumption that it is men who have the authority to define women, but to the precautions that have been taken to ensure that women do not claim too much real equality with men \u2013 in this life at least\"."]}, {"page": "Alan Billings", "response": ["Billings married Veronica Hardstaff in 2007, a former Labour councillor on Sheffield City Council and Member of the European Parliament for Lincolnshire and Humberside South (1994\u201399).

In 2003 a Sunday People article reported that Miln was running a rent boy S&M club in the flat he had shared with Pattinson. The investigation revealed that Miln had rent boys on his books charging \u00a3200 each. Miln told the undercover reporter that senior church figures, Westminster MP's, civil servants, and members of the royal household were amongst the clientele for his services and the monthly orgies he held. According to the People, Miln tried to recruit the reporter as a rent boy and gave him an ecstasy tablet to help him relax. Laboratory tests later confirmed it was the drug. Miln also reportedly offered the journalist unprotected sex, telling him: \"There is nothing better than dangerous sex. I could have HIV but at my age I don't care. If I then give it to someone it will be because of their stupidity.\" The Sunday People commented that it was a strange attitude from Archbishop Robert Runcie's former special adviser on AIDS.
