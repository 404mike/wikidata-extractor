He trained in the offices of Robert Rowand Anderson, and was responsible for the design and reconstruction of several churches. From 1912 to 1932 he was involved in the total rebuilding of Eilean Donan Castle on the west coast of Scotland, for John Macrae-Gilstrap.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eilean Donan", "response": ["The present castle buildings are entirely the result of 20th-century reconstruction by Gilstrap-Macrae, who commissioned Edinburgh architect George Mackie Watson to draw up the plans. Although the rebuilding followed the extant ground plan, the details of the present castle differ from its original appearance. The survey drawings by Lewis Petit were not rediscovered until the restoration was almost complete, and the restorers therefore were forced to rely on less accurate interpretations such as the work of MacGibbon and Ross, who attempted a plan of the remains in the late 19th century.  The clerk of works, Farquhar Macrae, is said to have based the reconstruction on a dream in which he saw the restored Eilean Donan. Rather than a genuinely medieval castle, Eilean Donan is described as \"a romantic reincarnation in the tradition of early 20th-century castle revivals.\" John Gifford, analysing the building against the Petit survey, notes a \"fussy elaboration of what was probably plain originally, and an omission of decoration where it once existed\", and describes the interior as \"a rubbly Edwardian stage-set for life in the Middle Ages\"."]}, {"page": "St Magnus Cathedral", "response": ["Major work was undertaken on the cathedral in 1908 by the architect George Mackie Watson: this included replacing the dumpy slated pyramid atop the tower with a taller spire clothed in copper sheeting. As a result, today's cathedral looks much more as it did until its original spire was struck by lightning in the late 17th century. Restoration and renovation work on the building continues, with increased urgency since it was discovered in the 1970s that the west end of the cathedral was in danger of collapsing away from the remainder of the structure. Other work has progressed further, and to celebrate its 850th anniversary in 1987 Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a magnificent new west window.  St. Magnus is the only wholly mediaeval Scottish cathedral, and one of the best-preserved buildings of the era in Britain."]}, {"page": "The Grange, Edinburgh", "response": ["* George Mackie Watson (1860\u20131948) architect"]}, {"page": "George Watson", "response": ["* George Mackie Watson (1860\u20131948), Scottish architect"]}, {"page": "McEwan Hall", "response": ["The design was begun in 1876 and was largely undertaken by George Mackie Watson whilst working in the offices of Robert Rowand Anderson (with the masterplan being by Rowand Anderson himself).

Initially MacRae-Gilstrap intended to preserve the ruins as they were and employed a local stonemason, Farquhar MacRae, to clear the site. He was engaged during the First World War, but returning to Kintail in 1919 he found Farquhar MacRae making preparations for a full restoration of the castle. Farquhar \"claimed to have had a dream in which he saw, in the most vivid detail, exactly the way the castle originally looked\".Marigold MacRae, quoted in  MacRae-Gilstrap agreed to go ahead with the reconstruction, and commissioned architect George Mackie Watson to prepare plans. The castle was fully rebuilt between the years 1920 and 1932. In the latter year the bridge to the mainland was completed, and a formal opening ceremony was held on 22 July 1932. The total cost of the restoration was around \u00a3250,000, largely funded by the Gilstrap inheritance."]}, {"page": "Ballochmyle House", "response": ["Ballochmyle House was designed by Robert Adam and completed in 1760 before being substantially rebuilt to a design by Hew Montgomerie Wardrop with assistance from George Mackie Watson in 1887.
