Stand-in captain Tim Munton took an early wicket but Nottinghamshire dominated the first day with Paul Pollard scoring a century in 295 minutes. He shared hundred partnerships with both Graeme Archer (41) and Paul Johnson (63) as the visitors closed a curtailed opening day on 268/4. Chris Lewis dominated the scoring on day two, taking his overnight score of 20 to 220 not out by the time of the declaration. He scored 21 fours and 6 sixes in his innings, and added 157 in 27 overs with Kevin Evans. Warwickshire lost three wickets in the remaining 20 over session. Warwickshire were made to follow on despite lower order resistance from Graeme Welch. He scored a career best 84 not out sharing in an eighth wicket stand of 68 with Neil Smith and added 86 with tail-enders Gladstone Small and Munton. Following on, Brian Lara was dismissed for a duck which brought his season average below 100 for the first time. The hosts closed day three on 134/3 with Roger Twose unbeaten on 74. Twose and overnight partner, Trevor Penney, were both dismissed inside the first 10 overs of the final day to reduce hopes of drawing the match. Three other wickets fell before lunch and Nottinghamshire's victory was achieved 45 minutes after the interval when Munton fell to Lewis, his sixth of the match."]}, {"page": "Kevin Evans", "response": ["Kevin Evans may refer to:", "* Kevin Evans (cricketer) (born 1963), former English cricketer", "* Kevin Evans (ice hockey) (born 1965), Canadian ice hockey player", "* Kevin Evans (cyclist)", "* Kevin Evans (archer)"]}, {"page": "List of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Kevin Evans (1984\u20131999) : K.
