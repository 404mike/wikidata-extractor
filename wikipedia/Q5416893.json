The original sandstone plaque is badly weathered and largely illegible and a more modern replacement has been fixed beneath it, at the instigation of Gerard de Lisle (another descendant), to perpetuate the inscription. It records that he \"performed valiantly at the Storming of the Water Bastion\" in Delhi during the Indian Mutiny, 14 September 1857, and where he was killed three days later, being awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously.", "Also in Cademan Wood - about a quarter of a mile away from site of the Temple - there is a mound, upon which are still to be seen the foundations of another wayside structure commissioned by De Lisle, built between 1863\u201364. This had been a tower, eighty feet in height, built as a memorial to De Lisle's son, Everard Aloysius Lisle Phillipps VC, and which became known locally as \"The Monument\". The surrounding woodland became known as \"Monument Wood\". The tower was designed by Edward Welby Pugin and was medieval in appearance, redolent of the Water Bastion in Delhi, where March Phillips had been killed during the Indian Mutiny of 1857. The tower was since demolished."]}, {"page": "E. W.
