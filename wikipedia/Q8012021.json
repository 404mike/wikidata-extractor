Compositions by Thomas Tallis, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell were included alongside works by contemporary composers such as Arthur Sullivan, Charles Villiers Stanford and John Stainer. Hubert Parry's I was glad was written as the entrance anthem for the 1902 coronation, replacing an 1831 setting by Thomas Attwood; it contains a bridge section partway through so that the scholars of Westminster School can exercise their right to be the first commoners to acclaim the sovereign, shouting their traditional \"vivats\" as he or she enters the coronation theatre. This anthem and Charles Villiers Stanford's Gloria in excelsis (1911) have also been used regularly in recent coronations, as has the national anthem, God Save the Queen (or King). Other composers whose music featured in Elizabeth\u00a0II's coronation include Sir\u00a0George Dyson, Gordon Jacob, Sir\u00a0William Henry Harris, Herbert Howells, Sir\u00a0William Walton, Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Ralph Vaughan Williams and the Canadian-resident but English-born Healey Willan. Ralph Vaughan Williams suggested that a congregational hymn be included. This was approved by the Queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury, so Vaughan Williams recast his 1928 arrangement of Old 100th, the English metrical version of Psalm 100, the Jubilate Deo (\"All people that on earth do dwell\") for congregation, organ and orchestra: the setting has become ubiquitous at festal occasions in the Anglophone world."]}, {"page": "Petersfield", "response": ["Actors Buki Akib, Jamie Campbell Bower, Arthur Brough, Tamsin Egerton, Ellis Jones, and Miranda Hart were all born or live in Petersfield, as are  the BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers actors Charles Collingwood (Brian Aldridge) and Edward Kelsey (Joe Grundy).
