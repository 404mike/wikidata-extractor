On the next day (Friday) the government tabled a reworded motion to its predecessor, seeking the confidence of the House in their policy on the Social Chapter instead of merely \"taking note\" thereof. As a result, the Government easily won the substantive question by 339\u2013299.

He was elected on the same day as fellow Labour member Bill Michie who like Blunkett would go on to serve as a Sheffield MP. Blunkett served on Sheffield City Council from 1970 to 1988, and was Leader from 1980 to 1987. He also served on South Yorkshire County Council from 1973 to 1977. This was a time of decline for Sheffield's steel industry. Blunkett and Michie were among  what political journalist Julia Langdon has described as  \"an energetic group of young Labour activists who emerged in Sheffield in the 1970s, a number of whom moved on to Westminster\". The Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam, Irvine Patnick, coined the phrase \"Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire\" to describe the left-wing politics of its local government.  Although bestowed as a criticism of the radical policies being pursued by  Labour councillors in the area, Langdon notes that it \"was in fact happily embraced by those it was intended to denigrate\". Sheffield City Council supported the National Union of Mineworkers in their 1984\u201385 strike, designated Sheffield a \"nuclear-free zone\", and set up an Anti-Apartheid Working Party.\"The rise and fall of socialism in one city\" , Nick Howard, International Socialism Journal, Winter 1995. Blunkett became known as the leader of one of Labour's left-wing councils, sometimes described pejoratively as \"loony left\".\"What is Labour for?\" , John Lanchester, London Review of Books, 31 March 2005. Blunkett was one of the faces of the protest over rate-capping in 1985 which saw several Labour councils refuse to set a budget in a protest against Government powers to restrain their spending. He built up support within the Labour Party during his time as the council's leader during the 1980s, and was elected to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee."]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish politicians", "response": ["*Irvine Patnick (1987\u20131997), Conservative MP"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Irvine Patnick; MP for Sheffield Hallam (1987\u20131997)"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Treasury", "response": ["**Irvine Patnick", "**Irvine Patnick", "**Irvine Patnick", "**Irvine Patnick", "**Irvine Patnick"]}, {"page": "Third Thatcher ministry", "response": ["|Irvine Patnick||25 July 1990 \u2013 November 1990||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "The Sun (United Kingdom)", "response": ["Three days after the accident, editor Kelvin MacKenzie published an editorial which accused people of \"scapegoating\" the police, saying that the disaster occurred \"because thousands of fans, many without tickets tried to get into the ground just before kick-off \u2013 either by forcing their way in or by blackmailing the police into opening the gates\".
