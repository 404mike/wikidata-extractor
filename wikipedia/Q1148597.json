Ledyard Stebbins", "response": ["Variation and Evolution in Plants was the first book to provide a wide-ranging explanation of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations as the result of the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variation\u2014that is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of C. D. Darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection."]}, {"page": "Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky", "response": ["Once at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f\u00fcr Hirnforschung (KWIH Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research ), Vogt and Timofeev-Resovskij began implementing the other half of the scientific agreement with Russia. In 1929 Timofeev-Resovskij became director of the Abteilung f\u00fcr Experimentelle Genetik (Department of Experimental Genetics). In 1930, the KWIH moved to its new facility in Berlin-Buch, which was partly financed by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The KWIH, with its departments of Neuroanatomy (Oskar and C\u00e9cile Vogt), neurohistology (Alois Kronm\u00fcller), Neurochemistry (Marthe Vogt),For these times in the history of German culture, the KWIH had a considerable number of women scientists on its staff including C\u00e9cile Vogt (wife of Oskar Vogt), Marthe Vogt (daughter of Oskar and C\u00e9cile Vogt), Elena Aleksandrovana Timofeeva-Resovskaja (wife of Nikolaj Timofeev-Resovskij), Natasha (Natalie) Kromm, Imgard L\u00fcx, Stella Rose, Rosa Schragenheim, Gertrud S\u00f6ken, and Estera Tanenbaum.

The research conducted in the genetics department, along with the permanent seminar on genetics organized by Timofeev-Resovskij, drew many young postdoctoral researchers who would ultimately become prominent scientists and the department gained the status of an institute; while Timofeev-Resovskij remained a citizen of the Soviet Union for his entire stay in Germany, his status and that of his department were recognized by the fact that he was appointed, in 1938, to the position of scientific member of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft. Timofeev-Resovskij's colleagues in his department included his wife Elena Aleksandrovana Timofeeva-Resovskaja, his Russian colleague Sergei Tsarapkin, the physician and radiation biologist Alexander Catsch (Katsch), the radiochemist Hans-Joachim Born, and the physicist and radiation biologist Karl Zimmer; a technical assistant, Natasha (Natalie) Kromm, was from Russia. Timofeev-Resovskij also collaborated with other eminent scientists including the nuclear chemist Nikolaus Riehl, who was the scientific director of the industrial corporation Auergesellschaft and the biophysicist Max Delbr\u00fcck, who had studied physics under Niels Bohr and Max Born.  Others drawn to Timofeev-Resovskij's department who would go on to become prominent scientists included Hans Bauer and Andriano Buzzati-Traverso. Through 20 years of collaboration with these and many others, Timofeev-Resovskij authored or coauthored over 100 papers written in German, English, Russian, and French.

He served as Dean of Wadham College for many years. Some of the social aspects of Mabberley's period as Dean of Wadham are dramatized in Stephen Henighan's novel The World of After.  Mabberley was senior proctor at Oxford 1988\u20131989, later becoming Curator of the Oxford University Herbaria.
