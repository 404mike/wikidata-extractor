Having the distinction of being one of the first players to represent the Reds, he made his debut in a Lancashire League match against Hyde Park United, which Liverpool won 8\u20130, he went on to help the Anfield club gain promotion to the Football League Division Two at the first attempt.\nHe was also chosen to play in Liverpool's first ever League match, a 2\u20130 away  victory this time over Middlesbrough Ironopolis. The wing man missed just one game as Liverpool went the whole season (28 games) unbeaten, they then went on to beat Newton Heath (later to become Manchester United) in the promotion 'test match'. Liverpool's stay in the top flight was brief, being relegated straight back down to the second tier by the end of their first season in Division One.McQueen moved to Derby County in July 1895 and played for them in the 1898 FA Cup Final during a six-year spell. He also represented Queens Park Rangers, Gainsborough Trinity, Fulham, Norwich City, Hibernian and Kilmarnock during the later part of his career.", "link_mentions": {}}}
