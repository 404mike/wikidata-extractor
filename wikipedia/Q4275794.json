Having the distinction of being one of the first players to represent the Reds, he made his debut in a Lancashire League match against Hyde Park United, which Liverpool won 8\u20130, he went on to help the Anfield club gain promotion to the Football League Division Two at the first attempt.\nHe was also chosen to play in Liverpool's first ever League match, a 2\u20130 away  victory this time over Middlesbrough Ironopolis. The wing man missed just one game as Liverpool went the whole season (28 games) unbeaten, they then went on to beat Newton Heath (later to become Manchester United) in the promotion 'test match'. Liverpool's stay in the top flight was brief, being relegated straight back down to the second tier by the end of their first season in Division One.McQueen moved to Derby County in July 1895 and played for them in the 1898 FA Cup Final during a six-year spell. He also represented Queens Park Rangers, Gainsborough Trinity, Fulham, Norwich City, Hibernian and Kilmarnock during the later part of his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Bloomer", "response": ["Derby County formed a baseball team in 1900 which Steve Bloomer played for in that season.

In fact Liverpool's first season in the Football League was an eventful one for McQueen as he found himself playing in numerous positions including five games in the Reds goal, a position he became familiar with playing a total of 37 times in Liverpool's first three seasons in the league. This made McQueen a unique record holder; he is the only man in English football history (probably the world) to have won championship winner's medals, albeit second division, as both an outfield player and a goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "1898 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|LW || Hugh McQueen"]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["| Hugh McQueen", "|MF|| Hugh McQueen|| Leith Athletic||Unknown||23-10-1892"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football families", "response": ["* Matt McQueen, Hugh McQueen (brother)"]}]}}
