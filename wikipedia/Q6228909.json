The 1693 financial endowment of Sir Thomas Cookes, 2nd Baronet (1648-1701) of Norgrove Court in Worcestershire, produced the first buildings on the present site and the historic link with Worcester College, Oxford, which he founded. The arms of Cookes (Argent, two chevronels between six martlets 3, 2 and 1 gules) were adopted by both Worcester College and Bromsgrove School. John Day Collis became head-master in December 1842. The tercentenary of the grammar school was celebrated on 31 March 1853. In 1856 Collis had the chapel and new school rooms built, and existing buildings enlarged and improved. In 1869 Bromsgrove was one of the fourteen founding schools of the Headmasters' Conference."]}, {"page": "Edward William Grinfield", "response": ["*1863\u20131865 John Day Collis"]}, {"page": "Collis (surname)", "response": ["*John Day Collis (1816\u20131879), British headmaster and educational writer"]}]}}
