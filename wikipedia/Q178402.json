It was derived from 'Allvega' and 'Allvegan' which had been used and suggested beforehand by original members and future officers of the society George A. Henderson and his wife Fay,\"Before the appearance of the first issue, Mr and Mrs G. A. Henderson suggested the name Allvega, with Allvegan as the magazine title. It was from this that the word Vegan was taken, and recently Mr and Mrs Henderson have written stating that they prefer the shorter version.\" Vegan News, February 1945 edition, Donald Watson the latter of whom wrote the first vegan recipe book. At first, they used it to mean \"non-dairy vegetarian\", however, by May 1945, vegans explicitly abstained from \"eggs, honey; and animals' milk, butter and cheese\". From 1951, the Society defined it as \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals\".Leslie Cross, \"Veganism Defined\", The Vegetarian World Forum, 5(1), Spring 1951. Interest in veganism increased significantly in the 2010s, especially in the later half, with more vegan stores opening and more vegan options becoming increasingly available in supermarkets and restaurants worldwide.", "In August 1944, several members of the Vegetarian Society asked that a section of its newsletter be devoted to non-dairy vegetarianism. When the request was turned down, Donald Watson, secretary of the Leicester branch, set up a new quarterly newsletter in November 1944, priced tuppence. He called it The Vegan News. The word vegan was invented by Watson and Dorothy Morgan, a schoolteacher he would later marry. The word is based on \"the first three and last two letters of 'vegetarian because it marked, in Mr Watson's words, \"the beginning and end of vegetarian\". The Vegan News asked its readers if they could think of anything better than vegan to stand for \"non-dairy vegetarian\". They suggested allvega, neo-vegetarian, dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivores, and beaumangeur.Donald Watson, Vegan News, February 1945, 2\u20133.", "The first edition attracted more than 100 letters, including from George Bernard Shaw, who resolved to give up eggs and dairy.Donald Watson, \"The Early History of the Vegan Movement\", The Vegan, Autumn 1965, 5\u20137; Donald Watson, Vegan News, first issue, November 1944.

World Vegan Day is held every 1 November to mark the founding of the Society and the month of November is considered by the Society to be World Vegan Month.  ", "Donald Watson, co-founder of The Vegan Society, stated in response to a question on why he was an ethical vegan, \"If an open-minded, honest person pursues a course long enough, and listens to all the criticisms, and in one's own mind can satisfactorily meet all the criticisms against that idea, sooner or later one's resistance against what one sees as evil tradition has to be discarded.\" On bloodsports, he has said that \"to kill creatures for fun must be the very dregs,\" and that vivisection and animal experimentation \"is probably the cruelest of all Man's attack on the rest of Creation.\" He has also stated that \"vegetarianism, whilst being a necessary stepping-stone, between meat eating and veganism, is only a stepping stone.\"", "Direct action is a common practice among veganarchists (and anarchists generally) with groups like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), the Animal Rights Militia (ARM), the Justice Department (JD) and Revolutionary Cells \u2013 Animal Liberation Brigade (RCALB) often engaging in such activities, sometimes criminally, to further their goals. Steven Best, animal rights activist and professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso, is an advocate of this approach, and has been critical of vegan activists like Francione for supporting animal liberation, but not total liberation, which would include not only opposition to \"the property status of animals\", but also \"a serious critique of capitalism, the state, property relations, and commodification dynamics in general.\" In particular, he criticizes the focus on the simplistic and apolitical \"Go Vegan\" message directed mainly at wealthy Western audiences, while ignoring people of color, the working class and the poor, especially in the developing world, noting that \"for every person who becomes vegan, a thousand flesh eaters arise in China, India and Indonesia.\" The \"faith in the singular efficacy of conjectural education and moral persuasion,\" Best writes, is no substitute for \"direct action, mass confrontation, civil disobedience, alliance politics, and struggle for radical change.\" Donald Watson has stated that he \"respects the people enormously who do it, believing that it's the most direct and quick way to achieve their ends.\" Sociologist David Nibert of Wittenberg University posits that any movement towards global justice would necessitate not only the abolition of animal exploitaton, particularly as a food source for humans, but also transitioning towards a socioeconomic alternative to the capitalist system, both of which dovetail into what he refers to as the animal\u2013industrial complex.", "The Vegan Society has written, \"by extension, [veganism] promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans.\" Many ethical vegans and vegan organizations cite the poor working conditions of slaughterhouse workers as a reason to reject animal products. The first vegan activist, Donald Watson, has stated, \"If these butchers and vivisectors weren't there, could we perform the acts that they are doing? And, if we couldn't, we have no right to expect them to do it on our behalf. Full stop! That simply compounds the issue. It means that we're not just exploiting animals; we're exploiting human beings.\"", "Donald Watson argued, \"If Jesus were alive today, he'd be an itinerant vegan propagandist instead of an itinerant preacher of those days, spreading the message of compassion, which, as I see it, is the only useful part of what religion has to offer and, sad as it seems, I doubt if we have to enroll our priest as a member of the Vegan Society.\""]}, {"page": "Animal testing", "response": ["Still, a wide range of viewpoints exist. The view that animals have moral rights (animal rights) is a philosophical position proposed by Tom Regan, among others, who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires, and as such are the \"subjects of a life\" with moral value and therefore moral rights.Singer, Peter (ed.). \"A Companion to Ethics\". Blackwell Companions to Philosophy, 1991. Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a \"moral dilemma\" view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research.Chapter 14, Discussion of ethical issues, p . 244  in: The ethics of research involving animals  at the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Published 25 May 2005 In contrast, an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal. Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Donald Watson has stated that vivisection and animal experimentation \"is probably the cruelest of all Man's attack on the rest of Creation.\" Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations.Rollin, Bernard E. (1998) \"The moral status of animals and their use as experimental subjects,\" in Kuhse, Helga and Singer, Peter (eds.). \"A Companion to Bioethics\". Blackwell Publishing, . Malcolm Macleod and collaborators argue that most controlled animal studies do not employ randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding outcome assessment, and that failure to employ these features exaggerates the apparent benefit of drugs tested in animals, leading to a failure to translate much animal research for human benefit."]}, {"page": "Keswick, Cumbria", "response": ["Later residents of the area have included the classical scholar, essayist, poet and founder of the Society for Psychical Research, Frederic Myers, who was born in Keswick,Gauld, Alan, \"Myers, Frederic William Henry (1843\u20131901)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2008, retrieved 28 August 2014  and the campaigner for animal welfare Donald Watson, founder of the Vegan Society, who lived in Keswick after retiring from teaching.Elliot, Rose. \"Obituary: Donald Watson\" , The Guardian, 14 January 2006 The pioneer mountaineers and photographers George and Ashley Abraham lived and worked in Keswick.McConnell, Anita. \"Abraham, George Dixon (1871\u20131965)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, retrieved 28 August 2014  Their photographic shop in Lake Road, built in 1887, was later taken over by the local mountaineer and outfitter George Fisher; the shop still contains memorabilia, including photographs, from the Abrahams' era.\"About us\" , George Fisher, retrieved 28 August 2014"]}, {"page": "Donald", "response": ["* Donald Watson (1910\u20132005), English animal rights advocate and founder of the Vegan Society"]}, {"page": "Barbara Wright (translator)", "response": ["*Simone Benmussa: Three Plays.
