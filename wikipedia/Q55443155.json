In June 2016, two months after the death of its inventor, Bryan Kibble, metrologists of the Consultative Committee for Units of the International Committee for Weights and Measures agreed to rename the device in his honor.Consultative Committee for Units (CCU),", "The principle that is used in the Kibble balance was proposed by Bryan Kibble of the UK National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in 1975 for measurement of the gyromagnetic ratio."]}, {"page": "Ampere balance", "response": ["A more complicated version of an Ampere balance, called the Kibble balance, that removes this source of inaccuracy by a calibration step, was invented by Bryan Kibble in 1975.  This experimental device was developed at government metrology laboratories worldwide with the goal of providing a more accurate definition of the kilogram, the world's standard of mass.  In this application, the Kibble balance functions in the reverse sense to the Ampere balance: it is used to weigh the International Prototype of the Kilogram, defining the kilogram in terms of an electric current and a voltage.  Since voltage and current themselves are already defined in terms of fundamental physical constants like Planck's constant and the speed of light, this has created a new definition of the kilogram in terms of these fundamental constants.  This is a more stable definition than the previous one, which was based on the physical prototype kilogram which is vulnerable to damage and deterioration over the years."]}, {"page": "Kibble", "response": ["* Bryan Kibble (1938\u20132016), British physicist and metrologist who invented the Kibble balance for measuring mass"]}, {"page": "List of Old Abingdonians", "response": ["* Bryan Kibble (1938\u20132016), British physicist, inventor of the Kibble balance"]}, {"page": "Bryan Peter Kibble", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bryan Kibble "]}]}}
