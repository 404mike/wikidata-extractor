He was educated at Eton and joined the British Army in 1853.\n\nWhen the Crimean War broke out in 1854, Tredegar, aged 22, held the rank of captain in the 17th Lancers and accompanied his famous regiment to the scene of the great struggle. He was in action at the Battle of Alma and later on 25 October 1854 was in command of a section of the Light Brigade that rode into the 'Valley of Death' at the Battle of Balaclava, which he survived. Godfrey's  horse, 'Sir Briggs', also survived, and lived at Tredegar's home, Tredegar House, Newport, Wales, until his death at the age of 28. He was buried in the Cedar Garden at Tredegar House (though not with full military honours as is frequently believed). The monument still stands there today.\nIn later years, as other members of the Morgan family had been in the past, he became a benefactor to the people of Newport. Large tracts of land were donated to the Newport Corporation for the benefit of the public, including Belle Vue Park, the Royal Gwent Hospital and Newport Athletics Grounds.  This earned him the nickname of \"Godfrey the Good\" among local people. He served as High Sheriff of Monmouthshire for 1858. Tredegar succeeded his father as 2nd Baron Tredegar in 1875.\n\nIn May 1902 he bought the lordships of the manor of Newport and Caerleon from the Duke of Beaufort, including the right to appoint a member of the Newport Harbour Commission.He was created Viscount Tredegar, of Tredegar in the County of Monmouth on 28 December 1905, and became the first Freeman of Newport in 1909.\nHe was awarded the Freedom of the City of Cardiff on 25 October 1909.Tredegar died on 11 March 1913 aged 81 and is buried at Bassaleg Parish Church. He never married and on his death the viscountcy became extinct and  his barony and baronetcy and the Tredegar estate passed to his nephew Courtenay Morgan, who spent little time in Wales.\n\nA statue of The Viscount Tredegar was unveiled in 1909 in Gorsedd Gardens, Cathays Park, Cardiff. The sculptor was Sir William Goscombe John.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar (1831\u20131913), Member of Parliament, land-owner and benefactor"]}, {"page": "Newport, Wales", "response": ["*1880\u20131900: Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar donates land for the benefit of the public, including Belle Vue Park, the Royal Gwent Hospital and Newport Athletics Grounds."]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire", "response": ["*Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar 23 June 1899 \u2013 11 March 1913"]}, {"page": "Tredegar House", "response": ["* Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar"]}, {"page": "Belle Vue Park", "response": ["The land on which the park stands was a gift to Newport from Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar in 1891 to provide a public park for its citizens."]}, {"page": "Rodney Parade", "response": ["In 1875, the Newport Athletic Club was created, and two years later they secured the use of land at Rodney Parade from Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar, for their cricket, tennis, rugby and athletics teams.
