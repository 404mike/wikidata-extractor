While he was serving as club secretary of Blackheath, the leading clubs in Scotland wrote a letter to the club issuing a challenge for a match between Scotland and England. Burns replied, agreeing to the contest. He was initially not meant to be among the 20-man England side, but the withdrawal of Francis Isherwood (who played in the second match) saw Burns take his place in the team. England lost the game, which was the first international rugby match, by one goal to nil on 27 March 1871. ESPNscrum lists him as playing as a forward in the match, but his obituary in The Evening Post suggests that he was a half-back. When he worked in India, Burns appeared for the Calcutta Football Club."]}, {"page": "Francis d'Aguilar", "response": ["D'Aguilar played rugby for the Royal Engineers within the army and made his international debut on 5 February 1872 in front of 4,000 spectators at The Oval in the England vs Scotland match. This was the second time the teams had met and in fact the second international match, as well as being the first time England had hosted an international rugby match. England won the match, a reversal of the previous year's result in Scotland. In this 1872 meeting Scotland opened the scoring with a drop goal from Cathcart. England responded through Hamersley touching down for a try. In itself, the try was not worth any points, but afforded England a \"try at goal\" and this was converted by Francis Isherwood. England then scored a dropgoal from the boot of Freeman in the second half. England continued to dominate and Francis d'Aguilar himself scored a try but Isherwood failed to convert d'Aguilar's try, thus no points were scored. Finney's try for England was also not converted. However, England prevailed by two goals to one, with two extra tries.Francis Marshall, Football, the Rugby Union game, p144-146, (Cassell:London), 1892 Shortly after his international appearance he was posted to India and spent much of his life there. He did return to England in the early part of the 1880s and on his return played for Bath as well as Somerset.County statistics for Gloucestershire His participation for Bath made him the earliest international to play for Bath, though he had already been capped when he joined them. Thus, Herbert Fuller who represented England in 1882 remains Bath's first international whilst playing for the club."]}, {"page": "List of Oxford University Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Francis Isherwood (1872) : F.
