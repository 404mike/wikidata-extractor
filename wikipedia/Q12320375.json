Soon enough, we get another call \u2013 they're shooting a video for the song\".

As 'Fireworks' closes the album, Franceschi moans about a girl who blew her chance; you can\u2019t help but think You Me At Six, in such a privileged position, have done the same\". Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic was more favorable. Despite criticizing an \"Americanised\" sound, the review offered praise to the band's progression; \"Josh Franceschi\u2019s vocals have clearly improved from the occasionally whiny attributes of his past, while the music on show has a much fuller sound. Thankfully, the better songs still have a multitude of hooks to keep you singing along and there is nothing downright awful included. It is just hoped that next time around, these strengths can be coupled with greater imagination and ambition\". Arwa Haider of Metro stated that while the band have \"stuck to a formula\", she praised the \"assured performances\".
