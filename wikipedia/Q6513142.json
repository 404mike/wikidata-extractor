Stephen Hughes scored a last minute equaliser at Filbert Street on 12 September 1998 to deny Leicester City a win. After the match, Wenger admitted the club were looking for a new striker to replace Ian Wright, being impressed with Leicester City's goalscorer Emile Heskey: \"We will still be buying a striker but unfortunately Leicester do not want to sell Heskey so we will have to go somewhere else \u2026 I'm impressed by Heskey. Today he did very well offensively and tried like crazy; too much for me.\" In Arsenal's next match, at home to Manchester United, goals from Tony Adams, Anelka and Freddie Ljungberg helped the champions inflict a 3\u20130 defeat; the result was Wenger's third consecutive win over rival manager Alex Ferguson. However, in the following match, Arsenal lost for the first time in the season, against Sheffield Wednesday.
