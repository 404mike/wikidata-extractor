The committee appointed the demographer and sociologist, David Glass, to coordinate research and he suggested that Douglas would be a suitable person to conduct the survey. Dr Frank Yates, a statistical advisor to Zuckerman and Dr Richard Schilling, chairman of the Industrial Health Research Board, also supported Douglas's appointment. Douglas like most people at the time, was particularly concerned with inequality, health in society and at home, and family circumstances. So when the job offer presented itself to study Obstetrics in relation to the falling birth rate, Douglas jumped at the opportunity; it would later define his whole life's work. Douglas was appointed to the position of Executive Director of the Maternity Survey of the Joint Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Population Investigation Committee under the aegis of the Royal Commission on Population. Notable members of the committee included vice-chairman,  Sir Alan Moncrieff, with Dermod MacCarthy also on the committee.
