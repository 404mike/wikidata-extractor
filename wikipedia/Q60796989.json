In March 1928, she married Edward Quayle, a statistician and amateur playwright, and became inspired to submit her own writing for publication. Ward published a few short stories, and in 1937 she received a job as a book reviewer for the Evanston News-Index. That same year, E. P. Dutton published Ward's novel The Tree Has Roots. A second novel, The Wax Apple, was published in 1938. Both books received decent reviews but did not achieve much popularity.Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Mugar Library, Boston University; Mary Jane Ward biography.", "*Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center: Mary Jane Ward collection", "*Moment of Indiana History: Mary Jane Ward", "*Goodreads.com: books by Mary Jane Ward"]}]}}
