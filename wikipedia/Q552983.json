He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. \nEllis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896.

This is because the latter was historically used to diagnose psychiatric disorders (e.g. transvestic fetishism), but the former was coined by the transgender community. The Oxford English Dictionary gives 1911 as the earliest citation of the term \"cross-dressing\", by Edward Carpenter: \"Cross-dressing must be taken as a general indication of, and a cognate phenomenon to, homosexuality\".

Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men, women, or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations.

In 1900, Elisar von Kupffer published an anthology of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time, Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur. His aim was to broaden the public perspective of homosexuality beyond its being viewed simply as a medical or biological issue, but also as an ethical and cultural one. Sigmund Freud, among others, argued that neither predominantly different- nor same-sex sexuality were the norm, instead that what is called \"bisexuality\" is the normal human condition thwarted by society."]}, {"page": "Coitus reservatus", "response": ["English novelist Aldous Huxley, in his last novel Island wrote that Maithuna, the Yoga of Love is \"the same as what Roman Catholicism means by coitus reservatus.\"Huxley, Aldous Island, Harper & Row, 1962 Getting to the point by discussing coitus reservatus, Alan W. Watts in Nature, Man and Woman notes: \"...I would like to see someone make a case for the idea that the Apostles really did hand down an inner tradition to the Church, and that through all these centuries the Church has managed to guard it from the public eye. If so, it has remained far more secret and \"esoteric\" than in any of the other great spiritual traditions of the world, so much so that its existence is highly doubtful...\"\"Watts, Alan W. Nature, Man and Woman, Ch 7, Pantheon Books Inc. 1958 The Welsh writer Norman Lewis, in his celebrated account of life in Naples in 1944, claimed that San Rocco was the patron saint of coitus reservatus:  \"I recommended him to drink -- as the locals did -- marsala with the yolk of eggs stirred into it, and to wear a medal of San Rocco, patron of coitus reservatus, which could be had in any religious-supplies shop\". The psychologist Havelock Ellis writes: \"Coitus Reservatus, \u2013 in which intercourse is maintained even for very long periods, during which a woman may orgasm several times while the penetrative partner succeeds in holding back orgasm \u2013 so far from being injurious to a woman, is probably the form of coitus which gives her the maximum gratification and relief\"."]}, {"page": "Hubert Bland", "response": ["Nevertheless, \"he sometimes disagreed with others in the group, and over the years he had been repeatedly outmanoeuvred and overruled by Shaw, Sidney Webb, and their supporters.

Many of the ideas that fueled this change in sexual thought were already floating around New York intellectual circles prior to World War I, with the writings of Sigmund Freud, Havelock Ellis and Ellen Key. There, thinkers claimed that sex was not only central to the human experience, but also that women were sexual beings with human impulses and desires, and restraining these impulses was self-destructive. By the 1920s, these ideas had permeated the mainstream.Woloch, Women and the American Experience: A Concise History p. 274."]}, {"page": "Edward Carpenter", "response": ["Carpenter included among his friends the scholar, author, naturalist, and founder of the Humanitarian League, Henry S.

The widened scope of the original legislation led to the subsequent notorious targeting of now acknowledged classics of world literature by such authors as Zola, James Joyce and D.H.
