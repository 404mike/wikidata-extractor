Born in Rochdale, part of Greater Manchester, he studied at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and had a role as Abanazer in a 1963 performance of Aladdin in the Royal Tunbridge Wells Opera House, which led to a 15-year-long legal battle with presiding agent, Alan Gale, over commission and the displacement of a large quantity of nose putty.\nLater, he played small parts in several TV shows, including a role as a postboy in the soap opera Compact and, after a dry spell, a non-speaking role as a Dalek operator. Seeing this as a particularly low point in his career, Summerton joined Hazel Malone's talent agency, where he met David Bowie, who was similarly attempting an acting career, and apparently expressed cynicism in Bowie's musical abilities.\nIn 1970 Summerton started his own talent agency, recruiting in its heyday Noele Gordon, the dance groups Love Machine and Hot Gossip, Lesley Joseph, Sinitta, Bonnie Langford and the Beverly Sisters. He later managed several dancers and choreographers, including Debbie Astell, Les Child, Thomas Michael Voss, Arlene Phillips and Bruno Tonioli.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Daleks", "response": ["Actor Alan Wheatley was chosen to portray Temmosus, the leader of the Thals, having worked with Hartnell in an episode of The Flying Doctor in 1959; David Markham was originally considered for the role. Virginia Wetherell was cast as the female Thal named Dyoni, having previously worked with Martin. Dinsdale Landen was chosen to play Ganatus, but production date changes forced him to drop out of the serial; he was replaced by Philip Bond, with whom Barry had worked on No Cloak \u2014 No Dagger. The names of the Thals were revised in the final script: Temmosus was originally Stohl, Alydon was Vahn, Ganatus was Kurt, Kristas was Jahl, Antodus was Ven, Dyoni was Daren, and Elyon was Zhor. Four actors were chosen as Dalek operators, due to their small stature and muscular ability: Robert Jewell, Kevin Manser, Michael Summerton, and Gerald Taylor; Barry knew Manser as a sensitive actor who reacted well to voices, while Martin knew Taylor through repertory theatre. Due to the Daleks' electronic voices, it was considered impractical for the actors inside the machines to also deliver the dialogue. As a result, the Dalek voices were performed off-set by Peter Hawkins and David Graham. Barry contacted the Post Office's Joint Speech Research Unit for information on electronic voices. Two samples were provided: one using a vocoder with low and medium monotone pitch; and one using written computer characters, generating a sound which was less human but more time-consuming. While Barry enjoyed these methods, the BBC opted to develop its own method to achieve a similar effect, as some of the Dalek speech was required in studio during production. Martin worked with Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to find suitable tones; ultimately, the actors spoke through a lip-ribbon microphone, which was later given an electronic quality after passing through a ring modulator."]}, {"page": "Summerton, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Summerton"]}, {"page": "Hazel Malone Management", "response": ["* Michael Summerton"]}]}}
