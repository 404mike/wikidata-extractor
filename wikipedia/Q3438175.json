But he got on with it and earned the players' respect by his craft, wide tactical knowledge, unfettered enthusiasm and far-sightedness. Scotland gained a new respect under his guidance. In fact, his tactical astuteness helped engineer one of the most successful periods in Scottish rugby history, 1971\u201377... Bill was a genuine hard man who certainly put fire into Scottish bellies. He created one of the most formidable Scottish packs of all time comprising Ian McLauchlan, Quintin Dunlop or Bobby Clark, Sandy Carmichael, Alastair McHarg, Gordon Brown, Nairn McEwan, Peter Brown and Rodger Arneil. He was a scrummaging expert who brought a new meaning to that phase of play and influenced the thinking in other countries.\""]}, {"page": "Mike Hipwell", "response": ["Hipwell played club rugby for Terenure College RFC and provincial rugby for Leinster Rugby. He made his full debut for the Ireland national rugby union team in 1962 playing against the England national rugby union team at Twickenham Stadium. He played for Ireland for ten years with his final international cap coming against the France national rugby union team at Lansdowne Road. He was used as the first official replacement used by Ireland in international rugby in 1969 after substitutions were permitted by the International Rugby Football Board. Hipwell was also selected to play for the British Lions on their 1971 tour to New Zealand. However Hipwell injured his knee in the tour as well as received facial damage in a match against the Canterbury Rugby Football Union and was replaced on the Lions tour by Rodger Arneil. It was suspected that the action to injure was predetermined by the Canterbury coaches so to damage the British Lions before they played the All Blacks as two Lions props were also injured in the match."]}, {"page": "1968 British Lions tour to South Africa", "response": ["*Rodger Arneil (Edinburgh Academicals and Scotland)"]}]}}
