He worked for several teams in Formula One before being appointed chief mechanic at Ferrari. He became a central figure in the 2007 Formula One espionage controversy. Stepney was latterly team manager for Sumo Power.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jean Alesi", "response": ["At the start of the 1997 season, Alesi was given an ultimatum from Flavio Briatore, warning him that 1997 would be his last chance to get good results. The car produced good results in pre-season testing, but Ross Brawn, Nigel Stepney and Rory Byrne joined Schumacher at Ferrari, and the Benetton's form during the season was erratic. His cause was not helped by an embarrassing retirement in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in  when he ignored several radio messages from the pit mechanics to come in for his pit stop, and continued for five laps until running out of fuel and was criticised by Briatore, who felt he had wasted a chance of a podium finish. He only scored three points in the following four races, but then had a strong run with some podiums, moving up into third place in the drivers' championship. However, there were further embarrassing incidents, such as at the French Grand Prix when he needlessly pushed David Coulthard off the track, and the Austrian Grand Prix, where his attempt to outbrake Eddie Irvine from nearly eight lengths behind caused a collision that saw Alesi placed under investigation for dangerous driving after the race. He took pole position at the Italian Grand Prix which sent the fans into raptures despite the fact that he no longer drove for Ferrari and led early in the race but lost out to David Coulthard's McLaren due to a slow pit stop. He finished fourth in the championship with 36 points, thanks to the disqualification of Michael Schumacher at the end of the season. Alesi's reputation was damaged during his spell at Benetton, having failed to win a Grand Prix despite having had a competitive car, and suffered by comparison with Schumacher at Ferrari. Alesi's contract with Benetton was not renewed at the end of the season and he signed a two-year contract with Sauber."]}, {"page": "List of people who died in traffic collisions", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Nigel Stepney"]}, {"page": "List of sporting scandals", "response": ["* 2007 Formula One espionage controversy, commonly known as Spygate \u2013 an incident in which Scuderia Ferrari mechanic Nigel Stepney passed on a secret document to Mike Coughlan of McLaren."]}, {"page": "2000 Spanish Grand Prix", "response": ["Michael Schumacher began to pull away from H\u00e4kkinen. de la Rosa ran into the rear of Alesi at Wurth corner on lap two causing Alesi to retire, with de la Rosa sustaining a broken front wing and retired after going off at Campsa corner. Further back, Irvine passed Verstappen for twelfth position. The positions at the front were the same for the next sixteen laps with the gap between Michael Schumacher and H\u00e4kkinen fluctuated from 1.6 seconds to 3.4 seconds while Coulthard and Barrichello battled Ralf Schumacher for third position. Button became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 18 and rejoined in front of Mazzacane. Villeneuve made his pit stop on the 21st lap, which promoted Frentzen into the points-scoring positions. After rejoining the circuit, his car caught fire and he pulled off to the side of the track at the exit of Seat corner. Trulli's pit stop, which dropped him to 17th, proved problematic: he stalled his engine which required his mechanics to restart it. Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop one lap later and re-emerged in fifth. On lap 24, Michael Schumacher made his pit stop. As he accelerated from his pit box, his rear wheel hit the Ferrari refuller Nigel Stepney who was dragged before being knocked over. Stepney was taken to the circuit's medical center for observation and he was replaced by reserve refuller Andrea Vacari. Coulthard made a pit stop on the same lap and experienced problems with leaving his pit box because he selected second gear and re-emerged behind Ralf Schumacher."]}]}}
