Anna Maria was one of the first European women to publish an eyewitness account of her experiences in West Africa with her husband, a previous surgeon on a slave ship who later became an abolitionist. Anna Maria\u2019s writing of the two voyages were used in the campaign to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. Ironically, she defended the slave trade in her own narrative called the Two Voyages to the River Sierra Leone during the Years 1791\u20131792\u20131793. Specifically relating to the type of slave auction called the scramble, Christopher Fyfe, a Scottish historian who specializes in West African history, gives a description of it from Anna Maria Falconbridge\u2019s perspective.Christopher Fyfe, \"Sale of the Slaves\" in Anna Maria Falconbridge (2017), 216. The scrambles witnessed were in Jamaica, one in Kingston, and the other in Port Maria. For the scramble in Kingston, the slaves were all collected upon the main and quarter deck of the ship where it was darkened (in order to prevent potential buyers from clearly seeing the slaves). Once the signal was given for the scramble to commence, the buyers rushed in. Slaves were so terrified that almost thirty of them jumped ship. The scramble in Port Maria was conducted similarly to the one in Kingston. Only this time, the situation of the slaves was more described. Fyfe describes the women as being terrified, clinging to one another in protection, and in great agony. The buyers are described as savages because of the brutal way they rushed on the slaves to grab and eventually purchase them."]}, {"page": "Paul Edwards (literary scholar)", "response": ["Edwards joined the staff of Edinburgh University in 1963.University of Edinburgh Journal, Vol. 35 (1992), p.262 Encouraged by Chinua Achebe, and helped by the historian of Sierra Leone Christopher Fyfe, in 1967 Edwards published an abridged edition of Equiano's autobiographical Narrative in Heinemann's African Writers Series, under the title Equiano's Travels.

Porter's analysis of the stratification of Creole society is considered the most authoritative work on the development of Creole society, and most scholars reference his book when researching the Creole people. The work he accomplished during his tenure at Fourah Bay College has made many look upon Porter as one in the mould of historian Christopher Fyfe, Professor Eldred D. Jones, Professor Akintola J. G. Wyse, and linguist Leo Spitzer."]}, {"page": "Circular Road Cemetery", "response": ["The cemetery has a long history of neglect. Writing in 1958, Christopher Fyfe complained that the cemetery was little cared for, mentioning that John Bowen, the bishop of Sierra Leone in the late 1850s had described the place as  \u201ca wild, neglected cemetery\u201d. Lee Karen Stow made similar complaints after visiting the cemetery in 2015. Freetown City Council is responsible for the cemetery's upkeep. However the Ministry of Lands, Country Planning and the Environment has been issuing documents which legitimise otherwise illegal occupation of parts of the cemetery. In this way the building of first temporary structures and then more permanent buildings has been encroaching on the land. The lack of any fencing has not helped the authorities to discourage this, or the dumping of waste there which is also prevalent. In October 2016 there were accounts of graves being opened and body parts removed. Although some fences had been erected, they were not sufficient to deter trespassing during the night after cemetery staff had gone home. Three people were arrested for this, two of whom were released for lack of evidence."]}, {"page": "Fyfe, Christopher", "response": ["#redirectChristopher Fyfe"]}]}}
