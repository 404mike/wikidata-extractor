His own more distinctive style, however, emerged and consolidated rapidly between 1950 and 1955, and probably owes as much to the period of study with Petrassi in Italy and familiarity with the work of a wide range of 20th-century European composers. He maintained a lifelong passion for the music of Bach (cf. his award-winning Fantasia Contrappuntistica Op.24, 1956).Subtitled 'Homage to Bach', also a reference to Busoni, this won the Busoni prize for composition at the competition in Bolzano in 1956, where it was premiered by a very young Maurizio Pollini.  A few pieces reflect experimentation or flirtation with serialism, although Leighton's works are more generally typified by a strong sense of lyricism, diatonicism, contrapuntal mastery, chromaticism and rhythmic invention."]}, {"page": "Armand D'Angour", "response": ["D'Angour was born in London Retrieved on 21 August 2012. and educated at Sussex House School and as a King's Scholar at Eton College.
