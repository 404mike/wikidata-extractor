In that year, Smith made As Seen Through a Telescope, in which the main shot shows a street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene. Even more remarkable is James Williamson's 1900 film, Attack on a China Mission. The film, which film historian John Barnes later described as having \"the most fully developed narrative of any film made in England up to that time\",  opens as the first shot shows Chinese Boxer rebels at the gate; it then cuts to the missionary family in the garden, where a fight ensues. The wife signals to British sailors from the balcony, who come and rescue them. The film also used the first \"reverse angle\" cut in film history."]}, {"page": "John Barnes (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Barnes (born 1963) is a Jamaican-born English international former professional footballer and manager.", "John Barnes may also refer to:", "* John Barnes (film producer) (1920\u20132000), American producer, director, and writer", "* John Barnes (film historian) (1920\u20132008), British historian", "* John Barnes (musician) (born 1932), English jazz saxophonist and clarinettist", "* John Barnes (author) (born 1957), American science fiction author", "* John Barnes (judge) (1859\u20131919), Wisconsin Supreme Court judge", "* John Barnes (British Army officer) (1746\u20131810), army officer and politician", "* John Barnes (mayor) (1817\u20131889), mayor of Dunedin, New Zealand", "* John Barnes (New South Wales politician) (1838\u20131915)", "* John Barnes (Australian politician) (1868\u20131938), union official and federal politician", "* John Barnes Jr. (born 1931), member of the New Hampshire Senate", "* John Barnes (manager) (1855\u20131929), Irish minor league baseball manager", "* John Barnes (Australian cricketer) (1916-2011), Australian cricketer", "* John Barnes (English cricketer) (1897\u20131945), English cricketer", "* John Barnes (Irish cricketer) (1916\u20131943), Irish cricketer", "* John Barnes (athlete) (1929\u20132004), American  middle-distance runner", "* John Barnes (Scottish broadcaster) (born c. 1960), Scottish sports commentator", "* John Barnes (Australian footballer) (born 1969), Australian rules footballer", "* John Barnes (outfielder) (born 1976), American baseball outfielder", "* John Barnes (catcher) (1903\u20131972), American baseball catcher in the Negro leagues", "* John Barnes (monk) (died 1661), Benedictine monk", "* John Barnes (computer scientist) (fl. 1970s\u20132010s), programming language designer", "* John Barnes, 5th Baron Gorell (born 1959), British chartered surveyor", "* John Barnes (department store), a department store in London"]}, {"page": "The Haunted Castle (1897 British film)", "response": ["However, the film historian John Barnes, in his book-length study of the year 1897 in British film, concluded that the title referred to a M\u00e9li\u00e8s film that had been referenced in England since May of that year.
