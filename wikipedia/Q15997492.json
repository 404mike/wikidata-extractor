The routes became more stylised but the arrangement remained, largely, geographic in nature. The 1932 edition was the last geographic map to be published before Beck's diagrammatic map was introduced.", "One of the major changes to be made to the revision of the Tube map put out in September 2009 was the removal of the River Thames. Although historically, the river was not present on several official maps (for example, according to David Leboff and Tim Demuth's book; in 1907, 1908 and 1919) and from 1921 it was absent for several years on pocket maps designed by MacDonald Gill. The Thames-free 2009 version was the first time that the river did not appear on the Tube map since the Stringemore pocket map of 1926. The latest removal resulted in widespread international media attention, and general disapproval from most Londoners as well as from the then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. Based on the reaction, the following edition of the diagram in December 2009 reinstated both the river and fare zones."]}, {"page": "Hayes, Hillingdon", "response": ["St Anselm's Church was completed in 1929 to the design of architect Hubert Christian Corlette.

Pick deliberately decided to commission a map which gave the company, as the BBC put it, a \"stronger brand\" as part of a simultaneous exercise in improving hygiene, punctuality, and image (if only, it has been suggested, by distracting the commuters from their travelling conditions).
