He is best known for his Universal adaptive strategy theory, for the unimodal relationship between species richness and site productivity (the \"humped-back model\"), for the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, for the DST classification (dominants, subordinates and transients) and, with Simon Pierce (University of Milan, Italy), universal adaptive strategy theory (UAST) and the twin filter model of community assembly and eco-evolutionary dynamics.Grime's 1979 book Plant Strategies and Vegetation Processes has been cited more than 1,200 times. Together with many influential scientific papers, it has made him a highly cited scientist. In an interview Grime has stated that \"Ecology lacks a Periodic Table\", quoting Richard Southwood.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christen C.

He is mainly remembered for his scheme of plant strategies to survive an unfavourable season (\"life forms\") and his demonstration that the relative abundance of strategies in floras largely corresponded to the Earth's climatic zones. This scheme, the Raunki\u00e6r system, is still widely used today and may be seen as a precursor of modern plant strategy schemes, e.g. J. Philip Grime's CSR system."]}, {"page": "List of ecologists", "response": ["* J. Philip Grime (UK)"]}, {"page": "Marsh Ecology Award", "response": ["*1997 J.
