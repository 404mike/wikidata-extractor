Findings have been made regarding human social behaviour related to infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, and parental investment.  The theories and findings of evolutionary psychology have applications in many fields, including economics, environment, health, law, management, psychiatry, politics, and literature.The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M.

Indirect reciprocity is a social interaction in which one actor helps another and is then benefited by a third party. Gossip has also been identified by Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary biologist, as aiding social bonding in large groups.", "From Robin Dunbar's evolutionary theories, gossip originated to help bond the groups that were constantly growing in size. To survive, individuals need alliances; but as these alliances grew larger, it was difficult if not impossible to physically connect with everyone. Conversation and language were able to bridge this gap. Gossip became a social interaction that helped the group gain information about other individuals without personally speaking to them. \u00a0", "*Robin Dunbar, Coevolution of neocortical size, group size and language in humans (pre-publication version) \"Analysis of a sample of human conversations shows that about 60% of time is spent gossiping about relationships and personal experiences.\""]}, {"page": "Homo habilis", "response": ["The behaviour of early Homo, including H. habilis, is sometimes modelled on that of savanna chimps and baboons. These communities consist of several males (as opposed to a harem society) in order to defend the group on the dangerous and exposed habitat, sometimes engaging in a group display of throwing sticks and stones against enemies and predators. The left foot OH 8 seems to have been bitten off by a crocodile, possibly Crocodylus anthropophagus, and the leg OH 35, which either belongs to P. boisei or H. habilis, shows evidence of leopard predation. H. habilis and contemporary hominins were likely predated upon by other large carnivores of the time, such as (in Olduvai Gorge) the hunting hyena Chasmaporthetes nitidula, and the saber-toothed cats Dinofelis and Megantereon. In 1993, American palaeoanthropologist Leslie C. Aiello and British evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar estimated that H. habilis group size ranged from 70\u201385 members\u2014on the upper end of chimp and baboon group size\u2014based on trends seen in neocortex size and group size in modern non-human primates."]}, {"page": "Mind", "response": ["* Robin Dunbar's social brain hypothesis"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Robin Dunbar (born 1947), British anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist, a specialist in primate behaviour."]}, {"page": "Keble College, Oxford", "response": ["Each year the Advanced Studies Centre invites distinguished speakers for their Creativity Lecture Series.

In primates, grooming is a social activity that strengthens relationships. The amount of grooming taking place between members of a troop is a strong indicator of alliance formation or troop solidarity. Robin Dunbar suggests a link between primate grooming and the development of human language.
