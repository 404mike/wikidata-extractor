Anjelica Huston also had issues with Gallo, and Gallo claimed Huston caused the film to be turned down by the Cannes Film Festival. After Gallo fired original cinematographer Dick Pope, director St\u00e9phane Sednaoui suggested Lance Acord, though Gallo has claimed credit for designing most of the film's cinematography, citing Acord as a \"button pusher\" who had \"never shot a feature film in his life\". Gallo also publicly disparaged Acord, saying \"This guy had no ideas, no conceptual ideas, no aesthetic point of view.\" Kevin Corrigan chose to opt out of the credits because he did not want to be associated with the film at the time."]}, {"page": "Mike Leigh", "response": ["Leigh released his twelfth feature film, the biographical period film Mr. Turner (2014) based on the life and artworks of J. M. W. Turner portrayed by Timothy Spall.

Spall received the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor Award and the film won the Vulcan Award for its cinematography by Dick Pope. Observer critic Mark Kermode described the film as a \"portrait of a man wrestling light with his hands as if it were a physical element: tangible, malleable, corporeal\". That year, Leigh joined The Hollywood Reporter for an hourlong roundtable discussion with other directors who had made films that year Richard Linklater (Boyhood),  Bennett Miller (Foxcatcher), Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game), Angelina Jolie (Unbroken), and Christopher Nolan (Interstellar).

Leigh's marvelous achievement is not only in capturing emotional clarity on film, but also in illustrating the ways in which families start to heal and find a certain bravery in their efforts\". Similarly, Kenneth Turan from the Los Angeles Times ranked the film among the best of the 14 features Leigh had written and directed by then. He found that Secrets & Lies was \"a piercingly honest, completely accessible piece of work that will go directly to the hearts of audiences who have never heard of him. If film means anything to you, if emotional truth is a quality you care about, this is an event that ought not be missed [...] Unforced, confident and completely involving, with exceptional acting aided by Dick Pope's unobtrusive camera work and John Gregory's telling editing, Secrets & Lies is filmmaking to savor\"."]}, {"page": "Topsy-Turvy", "response": ["Richard Schickel called the film \"one of the year's more beguiling surprises\" and a \"somewhat comic, somewhat desperate, very carefully detailed\" story given \"heartfelt heft\" in the way it depicts how rehearsing and putting on a comic opera \"takes over everyone's life\".
