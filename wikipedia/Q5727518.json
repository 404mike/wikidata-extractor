He was a keen breeder of Newfoundland dogs and had a pack of one hundred and twenty five.  He imported them through the port of Poole, Dorset and had a Crufts winner.He was elected at the 1885 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for West Dorset, and held the seat until his death. In 1891, an unnamed West of England M.P., now believed to have been Henry Richard Farquharson, was mentioned in a newspaper article as claiming that Jack the Ripper, the infamous murderer in the impoverished Whitechapel District in the East End of London, was the son of a surgeon and that he committed suicide after he had committed murder of Mary Jane Kelly on the night of 9 November 1888.  It is believed that the reference was to Montague John Druitt, a fellow West County man, who committed suicide at the end of November 1888 and whose body was retrieved from the Thames at Chiswick a month later. Druitt was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England, the second son of prominent local surgeon William Druitt, and his wife Ann (n\u00e9e Harvey).In the 1892 election, Farquharson libelled his opponent C. T. Gatty, and was forced to pay \u00a35000 damages a year later.He died on 19 April 1895, in the Red Sea, on a voyage home from Colombo, Ceylon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Henry Richard Farquharson"]}, {"page": "Montague Druitt", "response": ["Shortly after Kelly's murder, stories that the Ripper had drowned in the Thames began to circulate. In February 1891, the MP for West Dorset, Henry Richard Farquharson, announced that Jack the Ripper was \"the son of a surgeon\" who had committed suicide on the night of the last murder. Although Farquharson did not name his suspect, the description resembles Druitt. Farquharson lived  from the Druitt family and was part of the same social class.Spallek, Andrew (February 2008) \"The 'West of England MP' Identified\", Ripperologist 88: 31\u201334 The Victorian journalist George R. Sims noted in his memoirs, The Mysteries of Modern London (1906): \"[the Ripper's] body was found in the Thames after it had been in the river for about a month\".Cullen, p. 220 Similar comments were made by Sir John Moylan, Assistant Under-Secretary of the Home Office: \"[the Ripper] escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of 1888\" and Sir Basil Thomson, made Assistant Commissioner of the CID in 1913: \"[the Ripper was] an insane Russian doctor [who] escaped arrest by committing suicide in the Thames at the end of 1888\".Quoted in Cullen, p. 215 and Knight, p. 122 Neither Moylan nor Thomson was involved in the Ripper investigation.Cullen, p. 215"]}, {"page": "Melville Macnaghten", "response": ["In February 1891 a Conservative MP, Henry Richard Farquharson, the member for West Dorset, was telling people in London that he knew the murderer to have been a surgeon's son who had committed suicide. This story leaked to the press, though it never became a sensation. Like Macnaghten, Farquharson was a member of the upper classes who had attended Eton College and owned estates in the Far East. Macnaghten also had a potentially personal conduit of accurate information about Druitt \u2013 a close friend at the Home Office, Colonel Vivian Majendie (knighted in 1895). Colonel Majendie was also from a very distinguished family, was Chief Inspector of Munitions (1871\u20131898) and was justly acclaimed for his persistent bravery as a bomb disposal expert. Majendie was also related by the marriage of his first cousin's daughter, Isabel Majendie Hill, to the alleged Ripper (in 1888 Isabel had married Reverend Charles Druitt, the first cousin of Montague). According to Macnaghten, Druitt's own family \"believed\" he was Jack the Ripper. Due to speculation in the press about another madman, Macnaghten wrote a confidential report dated 23 February 1894 naming Druitt as a Ripper suspect and placed it on file. This document, in its entirety, was not publicly available until 1975 (the section mentioning only the suspects had been published in 1966). The alternate version of this same document, believed by many to be a draft, has never been sighted by a researcher and is thought to be lost. Instead a copy of this second version was made by Macnaghten's daughter Christabel, Lady Aberconway, who allowed some of its contents to be publicly broadcast by television presenter Daniel Farson in 1959. The name of the chief suspect was not revealed until 1965, by the American journalist and author Tom Cullen. Why Macnaghten composed two versions remains the subject of controversy, speculation and historical debate among writers on the Ripper mystery (some have argued that the so-called Aberconway version is a rewrite of the 1894 original). This report proved influential for Jack the Ripper research, for it popularised the idea that the Ripper only had five true victims and also named three possible suspects."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Henry Richard Farquharson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Henry Richard Farquharson"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|Henry Richard Farquharson"]}, {"page": "Farquharson", "response": ["*Henry Richard Farquharson (1857-1895) English politician"]}, {"page": "1895 West Dorset by-election", "response": ["The 1895 West Dorset by-election was held on 14 May 1895 after the death of the incumbent Conservative MP Henry Richard Farquharson.

In March that year his opponent Henry Richard Farquharson began a 'drirty tricks' campaign and told St John Brodrick in the House of Commons that Gatty had been expelled from Charterhouse aged 13. Brodderick repeated this to Conservative politician George Wyndham, a close friend of Gatty's, who immediately informed him. Gatty sued Farquarson for libel and slander.  During the course of the trial it emerged that Gatty had been the victim of bullying and abuse at the hands of older boys that \"went on \" at public schools. His father the Rev. Gatty called the slander \"an infamous lie\" and confirmed he had removed his son from the school and \" sent him to a private tutor\". The Lord Chief Justice said Gatty had been \"dragged to the stake\" for something that had happened \"30 years ago\".
