Ellis was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium.  He was born at Rolleston, Nottinghamshire.\nEllis made two first-class appearances for Nottinghamshire in the 1948 County Championship, against Leicestershire and Worcestershire, with both matches played at Trent Bridge.  Against Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 176/6 declared, with Ellis not required to bat.  Leicestershire responded in their first-innings by making 169/6, at which point the match, heavily impacted by adverse weather, was declared a draw.  In his second match, Worcestershire won the toss and elected to bat, making 200 all out.  In response, Nottinghamshire made 334 all out in their first-innings, with Ellis being dismissed for 29 by Peter Jackson.
