Wilkie spent the majority of his career in Dundee, playing for both Dundee and Dundee United. Wilkie started his career with Dundee, making over 100 appearances in the Scottish Premier League. He won 11 Scotland international caps between 2002 and 2003, during the tenure of Berti Vogts. Soon after this he suffered from a series of knee injuries, which led to Wilkie being released by Dundee in August 2006. Wilkie then signed for Dundee United and he again played regularly for a while, but ongoing knee problems forced his retirement from professional football in April 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dundee F.C.", "response": ["* Lee Wilkie (2002)", "*Lee Wilkie (2002\u201303)"]}, {"page": "Dundee United F.C.", "response": ["*  Lee Wilkie"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Lee Wilkie"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Kenny Miller, Lee Wilkie"]}, {"page": "Wilkie (surname)", "response": ["*Lee Wilkie (born 1980), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Daniel Cousin", "response": ["On 1 May 2008, Cousin was sent off during extra time of the Fiorentina v Rangers UEFA Cup semi-final second leg match for a headbutt.

A matter of days later, he did the same to Dundee United defender Lee Wilkie, in a 3\u20131 win mired in refereeing controversy. Although he was not sent off, Cousin was widely criticised for his stupidity. On 31 August, Cousin scored the opening goal in the first Old Firm match of the season. Rangers went on to win the match 4\u20132 and he was later sent off for two bookable offences. This was the player's final game for Rangers, but Rangers' then-assistant manager Ally McCoist said: \"That was as good a centre-forward performance in an Old Firm game as I've ever seen from anybody.

After the game McManus was photographed lying on the pitch in floods of tears.
