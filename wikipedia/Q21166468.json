The failures resulting from this form of corrosion can be catastrophic. With general corrosion it is easier to predict the amount of material that will be lost over time and this can be designed into the engineered structure. Pitting, like crevice corrosion can cause a catastrophic failure with very little loss of material. Pitting corrosion happens for passive materials. The classic reaction mechanism has been ascribed to Ulick Richardson Evans."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| Ulick Richardson Evans||17/03/1949||31 March 1889 \u2013 3 April 1980"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1949", "response": ["#Ulick Richardson Evans"]}, {"page": "1973 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Ulick Richardson Evans, FRS.
