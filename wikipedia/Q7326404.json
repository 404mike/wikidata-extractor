He lived in Brighton throughout his life. Nibbs initially trained as a musician and became a professional cellist with the Theatre Royal orchestra. However, a lifelong love of art combined with a natural talent for detailed observation led him to become a self-taught painter - in both oils and watercolour - particularly of marine subjects. In 1840 a substantial inheritance allowed him to devote himself full-time to art.\nHis marine art depicts scenes mainly off the coast of his native Sussex, France and Holland - though he also drew buildings and landscapes. He exhibited at the Royal Academy and other institutions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Apuldram", "response": ["At that time there were no warehouses at Dell Quay and no inn.  The citizens of Chichester gave this as a reason for asking permission to dig a canal from the quay to the town.  Permission was granted but with a condition that the canal must not cut through lands belonging to 'the Baron' (Howard of Effingham), and this made the scheme impractical.  Instead, the picturesque Crown & Anchor Inn was built at the end of the 16th century and seems to have been called initially  'Dell Key House' (not to be confused with the present Dell Quay House, which incorporates William Tipper's post mill built in the eighteenth century, the subject of paintings by Richard NibbsRichard Henry Nibbs (1816\u20131893) biography  and George Lambert)."]}, {"page": "Puckaster", "response": ["Puckaster has inspired several renowned paintings and drawings.

Its rector between 1719 and 1759, Charles Covert, did work on the chancel during his incumbency.  The antiquarian Sir William Burrell, 2nd Baronet, who visited most of Sussex's parish churches during the 18th century, recorded St Leodegar's Church as having a chancel and a nave with a south aisle.  It was pictured and described again 16 years later in The Gentleman's Magazine: there was a flat-arched entrance in the west wall and an older (apparently 12th-century) south door with Norman-style chevron moulding, a continuous roof over the nave and south aisle, a three-bay pointed-arched round-columned arcade separating the aisle and nave, and lancet windows throughout.  The church was said to be \"in so decayed a state that its utter ruin seems unavoidable before long\". Similar features were depicted in sketches by other artists in the 19th century, including one dated  1851 by Richard Henry Nibbs in which the nave and chancel were clearly in ruinous condition. His accompanying notes bore this out. A survey of Sussex churches by John Mason Neale and Benjamin Webb in 1841 noted that there were wall murals inside in the form of painted Biblical verses."]}]}}
