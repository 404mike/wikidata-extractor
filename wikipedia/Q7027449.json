One of a handful of non-Japanese carvers of netsuke, Lamb has built a reputation since the 1980s as one of the best living practitioners of this art. He is known for meticulous, graceful carvings, typically of animals. His preferred medium for carving is boxwood.  Lamb was born in 1948 in Cambridge, England, and educated at Berkshire College, Maidenhead, Berkshire, England. He originally trained as a graphic designer, and was introduced to netsuke by someone who had seen a miniature carving he had done as a pastime. He began to carve full-time in 1988 and moved to the United States in 1995 to be closer to fellow carvers and netsuke collectors.", "thumb|Nick Lamb, \"Pygmy Owl\"", "thumb|Nick Lamb, \"Winter Wren\"", "Miller, Dale S., \u201cNetsuke Carver:  Nick Lamb,\u201d Daruma 19 (1998), p.\u00a018.", "Miller, Dale S., \u201cNick Lamb,\u201d Netsuke Kenkyukai Journal (1998), 18: 1, pp.\u00a045\u201348.", "Kinsey, Robert O. and Miriam, \u201cNick Lamb\u2019s Zodiac Animals 2000,\u201d Netsuke Kenkyukai Journal, 19: 4 (1999), pp.\u00a030\u201332.", "Marsh, Elizabeth, \u201cEarly Carvings from Nick Lamb,\u201d Euronetsuke (1999), no. 12, pp.\u00a017\u201319."]}, {"page": "Nick Lamb", "response": ["Nick Lamb may refer to:", "* Nick Lamb (sculptor)", "* Nick Lamb (cricketer)"]}]}}
