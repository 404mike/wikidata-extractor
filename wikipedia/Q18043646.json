The series provided musicians with a space in which to present their talent, while giving the public a chance to listen to classical music. Following the opening of Kumho Art Hall in December 2000, the gallery concert was reborn as the 'Friday Special Concert Series', which saw performances every Friday at its new abode. When this series celebrated its 10th anniversary in June 2007, it was renamed the 'Beautiful Thursday Series'. Established Korean artists, including Dong-Suk Kang, Daejin Kim, Kyung-wha Chung, Myung-wha Chung, and international musicians of note such as J\u00f6rg Demus, Heinz Holliger, Igor Ozim, Miriam Fried, and Matthew Barley, have performed there."]}, {"page": "Barley, Matthew", "response": ["#redirectMatthew Barley"]}]}}
