Haslett's batting style is unknown.  Though unknown when and where he was born, it is known he was christened at Petworth, Sussex on 12 August 1817.\nHaslett made his first-class debut for Sussex against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1837.  He made four further first-class appearances that season, that last of which came against Nottinghamshire.  He scored 23 runs in his five matches that season, which came at an average of 2.87, with a high score of 16.  He later made a single first-class appearance for Sussex County Cricket Club in 1841 at Lord's against the Marylebone Cricket Club.  He batted at number ten in Sussex's first-innings of 48 all out, scoring 3 runs before he was dismissed by John Bayley.  Kent were dismissed for 44 in their reply, with Sussex going on to make 93 in their second-innings, in which Haslett was promoted to open the batting, from which he was dismissed for a duck by James Cobbett.  The Marylebone Cricket Club made 98/7 in their second-innings to win the match by 3 wickets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Frederick Haslett"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Frederick Haslett"]}]}}
