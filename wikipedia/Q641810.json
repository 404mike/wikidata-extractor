Two years later at London he won a gold medal as a member of British 4\u00d7200 metre freestyle relay team and was second in his heat of 100 metre freestyle and did not advance. Four years later at Stockholm he was third in his heat of 100 metre freestyle and did not advance. The International Olympic Committee credits him with a gold medal in water polo at the 1900 Summer Olympics, but this is incorrect as sources contemporary to the Games indicate that he was in England too soon after the tournament to have been in Paris. The Daily Telegraph, dated Saturday, August 11, 1900 reported that Derbyshire did not make the trip and was replaced by Thomas Coe, who like Derbyshire, was a member of the Osborne Swimming Club. <The Daily Telegraph, Saturday, August 1, 1900. />\nIn 1921 Derbyshire was a founding member of the Penguin Swimming Club, later to become the Hammersmith Penguin Swimming Club through their merger with the Hammersmith Ladies Swimming Club (itself founded by his wife Alice in 1916) in 1976, which was renamed the West London Penguin Swimming and Water Polo Club in 2006.
