The history of casting a single actor as multiple characters in a play is perhaps as old as acting itself. Excepting Old Comedy, there is a well-known but little discussed rule in the drama of ancient Greece that only three actors played all the speaking characters in a tragedy. Over two thousand years later, even Shakespeare had a limited number of actors to cast in his plays (scholars\u2019 estimates vary from eleven to sixteen), a theatrical exigency that occasioned much doubling and tripling of roles. This theatrical troupe mentality of having various actors playing various characters may also be located in the movies, such as those featuring the comedy group Monty Python, like Life of Brian in 1979. Regardless, the casting of an actor in multiple roles in the movies has been primarily conceptual, and not due to a lack of other performers."]}, {"page": "Lights of London (1914 film)", "response": ["* Rolf Leslie"]}, {"page": "Victory and Peace", "response": ["* Rolf Leslie as Abraham Lincoln"]}, {"page": "The Beetle (film)", "response": ["* Rolf Leslie as Holt"]}, {"page": "The Man Who Bought London", "response": ["* Rolf Leslie as Horace Baggins"]}, {"page": "Sixty Years a Queen", "response": ["* Rolf Leslie as 27 Different Roles "]}, {"page": "The Ticket-of-Leave Man (1918 film)", "response": ["* Rolf Leslie as Melter Moss "]}, {"page": "Dollars in Surrey", "response": ["* Rolf Leslie "]}, {"page": "The Faith of a Child", "response": ["The Faith of a Child is a 1915 British silent drama film directed by Floyd Martin Thornton and starring  Evelyn Boucher, Rolf Leslie and Bert Grahame.Rajadhyaksha & Willemen p.169", "* Rolf Leslie as Landlord  "]}]}}
