Corinthian countered, resulting in shots from both Claude and Gilbert Ashton within 15 seconds of each other. Another Cardiff attack resulted in Ferguson missing the goal from a few feet out once again. After four minutes in the second half, Corinthians attacked once more. Fred Ewer played it down the left wing to Kenneth Hegan, who passed it into the centre towards Gilbert Ashton, who fired it past Farquharson. Shortly after the restart, Billy Thirlaway appeared to be about to score a certain goal for Cardiff, but was charged down by Russell. Further chances came in rapid succession; for Cardiff, Ferguson struck the crossbar with one shot; then for Corinthian, Claude Ashton passed forward to Jenkins, who struck it wide of an open goal mouth. Hegan sent the ball over the bar, and then a further shot by Claude Ashton was charged down.", "|MF || Fred Ewer"]}, {"page": "Ewer (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Fred Ewer (1898\u20131971), English footballer "]}, {"page": "Frederick Ewer", "response": ["#REDIRECTFred Ewer"]}, {"page": "1923 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| ||6 || Fred Ewer, Casuals"]}, {"page": "1924 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| ||6 || Fred Ewer, Casuals"]}]}}
