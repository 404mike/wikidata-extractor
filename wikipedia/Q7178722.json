Prior to the 1950s, the courts were willing to approve \"compromise\" agreements as to what terms meant, not only when they were disputed but also for the benefit of certain parties, such as minors. In 1954, the House of Lords decided in Chapman v Chapman that this would no longer be permitted, creating a gap between the rights of trusts under the Settled Land Act 1925 (which could be altered if there was a flaw) and those trusts that were not (which were affected by the Chapman decision). As a result, following a report by the Law Reform Committee, Petre Crowder introduced the Variation of Trusts Bill to Parliament, where it was given the Royal Assent on 23 July 1958, and came into force as the Variation of Trusts Act 1958.", "Prior to the 1950s, the courts commonly accepted that they could approve a \"compromise\" agreement where there was a dispute over the precise meaning of words in a trust document. In some cases, the courts used this to rearrange trusts for the benefit of certain parties (such as minors) where there was no real dispute.Edwards (2007) p.165 In 1954 however, the House of Lords decided in Chapman v Chapman [1954] AC 429 that this power was reserved for a genuine dispute.Edwards (2007) p.166 This decision caused frustration: where previously all trusts could be varied, either through the court's ability to create a \"compromise\" agreement or the rights granted to trusts which came under the Settled Land Act 1925, Chapman limited this right to those created under the 1925 Act.Edwards (2007) p.171 In January 1957 the Lord Chancellor asked the Law Reform Committee \"to consider whether any alteration is desirable in the powers of the court to sanction a variation in the trusts of a settlement in the interests of beneficiaries under disability and unborn persons, with particular reference to the decision in Chapman v. Chapman\", and a report was presented to Parliament in November of that year.Price (1959) p.56 A draft bill was drawn up and introduced by Petre Crowder, the Member of Parliament for Ruislip-Northwood; it received its second reading in the House of Lords on 12 June 1958, and was given the Royal Assent on 23 July 1958."]}, {"page": "Crowder (surname)", "response": ["*Petre Crowder, British politician"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Petre Crowder"]}]}}
