The family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (now demolished) where Andrews's maternal grandmother had served as a maid.  Andrews's stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the independent arts educational school Cone-Ripman School (ArtsEd) in London, and thereafter with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame Lilian Stiles-Allen. Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, \"She had an enormous influence on me,\" adding, \"She was my third mother\u00a0\u2013 I've got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world.\" In her memoir Julie Andrews \u2013 My Star Pupil, Stiles-Allen records, \"The range, accuracy and tone of Julie's voice amazed me\u00a0... she had possessed the rare gift of absolute pitch\", though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography Home.Windeler (1970), pp. 22\u201323 According to Andrews, \"Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was\". Of her own voice, she says, \"I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range \u2013 dogs would come from miles around.\" After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.", "Termed \"Britain's youngest prima donna\", Andrews's classically trained soprano voice, lauded for its \"pure and clear\" sound, has been described as light, bright and operatic in tone. When a young Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by a throat specialist, the doctor concluded that she had \"an almost adult larynx.\" Despite the continual encouragement to pursue opera by her voice teacher, English soprano Lilian Stiles-Allen, Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and \"too big a stretch\". At the time, Andrews described her own voice as \"extremely high and thin\", feeling that it lacked \"the necessary guts and weight for opera\", preferring musical theatre instead. As she aged, so did her voice, which began to naturally deepen. Losing her vast upper register, her \"top notes\" became increasingly difficult to sing while \"her middle register matured into the warm golden tone\" for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong of The Daily Telegraph."]}, {"page": "Serenade to Music", "response": ["|Isobel Baillie, Lilian Stiles-Allen, Elsie Suddaby, Eva Turner", "|Lilian Stiles-Allen", "|Lilian Stiles-Allen"]}, {"page": "Stiles", "response": ["* Lilian Stiles-Allen (1896\u20131982), British soprano of the mid 20th century"]}, {"page": "Muriel Brunskill", "response": ["In December 1928 Brunskill was in Beecham's Queen's Hall RPS presentation of Handel's Hercules with Dora Labbette, Lilian Stiles-Allen, Tudor Davies and Horace Stevens.Elkin, pp. 158 and 164.
