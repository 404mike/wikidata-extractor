She was introduced as a playable character in an April 2016 update for the crossover multiplayer online battle arena game Heroes of the Storm, nearly a month prior to the release of Overwatch.\nThe character, who is of British origin, has been noted by video game outlets to be peppy and energetic. In the game, Tracer has low health, but is highly mobile with her skills including a teleportation-like ability and time-travel. Those abilities were caused by an accident that left her unable to maintain a physical form in the present until Winston invented the chronal accelerator, a device that allows her to control her own time frame.\nTracer is one of the most recognizable Overwatch characters. She is prominently featured in the game's official media, including promotional works and the game's cover art and appears in fan art. Tracer has attracted media coverage related to online controversies surrounding one of her in-game victory poses, as well as her prominence in fan-produced pornography, which Blizzard has tried to remove. The character has appeared in Overwatch animated media and a digital comic series based on the game.

Shepard, who is openly gay, said the promotion of Soldier: 76's past in the game's lore \"feels more like a trap than an honest invitation\", and criticized Blizzard for not being \"brave enough to let the character be who he is in the game itself\", and that they have passively enabled the conditions of a toxic environment that makes certain players like him feel threatened and harassed.
