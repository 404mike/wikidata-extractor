His work is commonly associated with the study of subcultures, and its resistance against the mainstream of society. His current research interests include media topographies, desert studies, and performative criticism.\nHebdige has written extensively on contemporary art, design, media and cultural studies, on mod style, reggae, postmodernism and style, surrealism, improvisation, and Takashi Murakami. He has published three books: Subculture: The Meaning of Style (1979), Cut\u2019n\u2019mix: Culture, Identity and Caribbean Music (1987), and Hiding in the Light: On images and Things (1988). From 1974 to 2016, he published over 57 essays and articles.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Postmodernism", "response": ["In part in reference to post-modernism, conservative English philosopher Roger Scruton wrote, \"A writer who says that there are no truths, or that all truth is 'merely relative,' is asking you not to believe him.

He wrote that subcultures can be perceived as negative due to their nature of criticism to the dominant societal standard. Hebdige argued that subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.", "In the work of John Clarke, Stuart Hall, Tony Jefferson and Brian Roberts of the Birmingham CCCS (Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies), subcultures are interpreted as forms of resistance. Society is seen as being divided into two fundamental classes, the working class and the middle class, each with its own class culture, and middle-class culture being dominant. Particularly in the working class, subcultures grow out of the presence of specific interests and affiliations around which cultural models spring up, in conflict with both their parent culture and mainstream culture. Facing a weakening of class identity, subcultures are then new forms of collective identification expressing what Cohen called symbolic resistance against the mainstream culture and developing imaginary solutions for structural problems. As Paul Willis and Dick Hebdige underline, identity and resistance are expressed through the development of a distinctive style which, by a re-signification and \u2018bricolage\u2019 operation, use cultural industry goods to communicate and express one's own conflict. Yet the cultural industry is often capable of re-absorbing the components of such a style and once again transforming them into goods. At the same time the mass media, while they participate in building subcultures by broadcasting their images, also weaken them by depriving them of their subversive content or by spreading a stigmatized image of them.", "The study of subcultures often consists of the study of symbolism attached to clothing, music and other visible affectations by members of subcultures, and also of the ways in which these same symbols are interpreted by members of the dominant culture. Dick Hebdige writes that members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms and argot.Hebdige 1981", "Music-based subcultures are particularly vulnerable to this process; what may be considered subcultures at one stage in their historiessuch as jazz, goth, punk, hip hop and rave culturesmay represent mainstream taste within a short period.Blair, M. Elizabeth, \"Commercialization of Rap Music Youth Subculture.\" Journal of Popular Culture 27.3 (1993): 21-33. Print.

Objects borrowed from the most sordid of contexts found a place in punks' ensembles; lavatory chains were draped in graceful arcs across chests in plastic bin liners. Safety pins were taken out of their domestic 'utility' context and worn as gruesome ornaments through the cheek, ear or lip ... fragments of school uniform (white bri-nylon shirts, school ties) were symbolically defiled (the shirts covered in graffiti, or fake blood; the ties left undone) and juxtaposed against leather drains or shocking pink mohair tops.Dick Hebdige p.106-12"]}, {"page": "Polysemy", "response": ["For Dick Hebdige,Hebdige, D.

Early mods watched French and Italian art films and read Italian magazines to look for style ideas. They usually held semi-skilled manual jobs or low grade white-collar positions such as a clerk, messenger or office boy. According to Dick Hebdige, mods created a parody of the consumer society that they lived in.", "According to Hebdige, by around 1963, the mod subculture had gradually accumulated the identifying symbols that later came to be associated with the scene, such as scooters, amphetamine pills and R&B music. While clothes were still important at that time, they could be ready-made. Dick Hebdige wrote the term mod covered a number of styles including the emergence of Swinging London, though to him it defined Melly's working class clothes-conscious teenagers living in London and south England in the early to mid-1960s.", "Dick Hebdige argued that the subculture lost its vitality when it became commercialised and stylised to the point that mod clothing styles were being created \"from above\" by clothing companies and by TV shows like Ready Steady Go!, rather than being developed by young people customising their clothes and combining different fashions.Hebdige, Dick. \"The Meaning of Mod\".

Routledge, 1993) p. 168 Terry Rawlings argued that the mod scene developed when British teenagers began to reject the \"dull, timid, old-fashioned, and uninspired\" British culture around them, with its repressed and class-obsessed mentality and its \"naffness\". Mods rejected the \"faulty pap\" of 1950s pop music and sappy love songs. They aimed at being \"cool, neat, sharp, hip, and smart\" by embracing \"all things sexy and streamlined\", especially when they were new, exciting, controversial or modern. Hebdige claimed that the mod subculture came about as part of the participants' desire to understand the \"mysterious complexity of the metropolis\" and to get close to black culture of the Jamaican rude boy, because mods felt that black culture \"ruled the night hours\" and that it had more streetwise \"savoir faire\". Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss argued that at the \"core of the British Mod rebellion was a blatant fetishising of the American consumer culture\" that had \"eroded the moral fiber of England.\"Benstock, Shari and Suzanne Ferriss, On Fashion (Rutgers University Press, 1994) ,  In doing so, the mods \"mocked the class system that had gotten their fathers nowhere\" and created a \"rebellion based on consuming pleasures\".", "Wilson argued that the significance of amphetamines to the mod culture was similar to that of LSD and cannabis within the subsequent hippie counterculture. Dick Hebdige argued that mods used amphetamines to extend their leisure time into the early hours of the morning and as a way of bridging the gap between their hostile and daunting everyday work lives and the \"inner world\" of dancing and dressing up in their off-hours.Hebdige, Dick, \"The Meaning of Mod,\" in Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson, eds., Resistance Through Rituals: Youth Subcultures in Post-War Britain (London: Routledge, 1993) p. 171", "In early-1960s Britain, the two main youth subcultures were mods and rockers. Mods were described in 2012 as \"effeminate, stuck-up, emulating the middle classes, aspiring to a competitive sophistication, snobbish, [and] phony\", and rockers as \"hopelessly naive, loutish, [and] scruffy\", emulating the motorcycle gang members in the film The Wild One, by wearing leather jackets and riding motorcycles.

Distinctive Black British slang did not become widely visible until the 1970s (prior to this, influences from African-American slang were slipping into the British lexicon, but they were not home-grown). The popularity of Jamaican music in the UK, such as reggae and ska, led to the emergence of slang rooted in Jamaican patois being used in the UK, setting the foundation for what would later become known as MLE. Research conducted in the early 1980s concluded that adolescents of Afro-Caribbean descent were 'bidialectal', switching between Jamaican creole and London English; while white working class adolescents would sometimes use creole words, they largely spoke cockney at home. In 1985, Smiley Culture, a British musician of Jamaican and Guyanese heritage, released \"Cockney Translator\", one of the first examples of British 'white slang' and British 'Black slang' appearing side-by-side on a record (however, still distinct from each other). While Smiley Culture was commenting on how the two forms of slang were very distinct from each other and lived side-by-side, more natural fusions would become common in later years. Some hip-hop artists from the late 80s and early 90s, such as London Posse, regularly infused both cockney and patois influenced slang in their music, showcasing how elements of both were becoming very much entwined and influencing each other, reflecting how younger, working-class Londoners were speaking. Such influences were not restricted to persons of a specific racial background.

In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender. Cultural studies is concerned with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends to \"fit in\" certainly qualifies since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice."]}, {"page": "Angela McRobbie", "response": ["In 1980, McRobbie published the article \"Settling Accounts with Subculture.
