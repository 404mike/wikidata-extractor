He was educated at King's Collegiate School, Windsor, Nova Scotia and Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia where he was awarded a BSc in 1934 and an MSc in 1936. He then proceeded to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received his first PhD in 1938 on the anomalous thermal behaviour of the ferro-electric Rochelle salt.Awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1937, he left MIT for St John's College, Cambridge and the Cavendish Laboratory in 1938. There he made accurate measurements of the thermal expansion of aluminium and lead and gained a second PhD in 1942, acquiring a lifelong interest in X-ray crystallography in the process. His interest was particularly stimulated by a research paper he was asked to review on deriving absolute from relative intensities of X-ray diffraction data which made him aware of the analytic power of crystallographic statistics. His book X-ray Optics, first published in 1949, is still a definitive work on the subject.\nHe left Cambridge in 1945 to be a lecturer in the Department of Physics at University College, Cardiff becoming in 1954 Professor of Physics and Director of the Viriamu Jones Laboratory, a post he held until 1965. There he founded a school of organic crystal chemistry which achieved world-wide recognition for its work on alkaloids and other organic substances. In the late 1940s he demonstrated that the symmetry elements of a crystal structure can be deduced from observed diffraction data.\nThe introduction of commercial X-ray powder diffractometers about 1950 led to his further contributions to X-ray diffraction being published in 1963 in the Mathematical Theory of X-ray Powder Diffraction. Together with H.S. Peiser and H.P. Rooksby, he was editor of X-ray Diffraction by Polycrystalline Materials, first published in 1955. He also co-authored X-ray Diffraction in 1974. He was also active in the editorial field, as Editor of Acta Crystallographica from 1960 to 1977 and Associate Editor of the Proceedings of the Royal Society from 1978 to 1983.\nIn 1965 he was appointed Professor of Crystallography in the Department of Physics at Birmingham University, where he continued to pursue his research interests and editorial activities. Shortly before his retirement in 1982, he was involved in the formation of the British Crystallographic Association. After retirement he returned to Cambridge to chair the International Union of Crystallography's Commission on International (Crystallographic) Tables, which were in need of updating.\nIn 1963 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.He had married Harriett Friedeberg in 1946; they had two sons and a daughter. He died in Cambridge on 1 July 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Chilton Phillips", "response": ["He was born in Ellesmere, Shropshire which gave rise to his title Baron Phillips of Ellesmere.  He was educated at Oswestry High School for Boys and then at the University College of South Wales and Monmouth where he studied physics, electrical engineering, and mathematics.  His degree was interrupted between 1944 and 1947 for service in the Royal Navy as a radar officer on HMS Illustrious.  He returned to Cardiff to complete his degree (BSc in 1948) and then undertook postgraduate studies with Arthur Wilson (crystallographer).  He gained his doctorate (PhD) in 1951. After a postdoctoral period at the National Research Council in Ottawa (1951\u201355) he joined the Royal Institution.  In 1966 he became the Professor of Molecular Biophysics in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford where he remained until his retirement in 1990.  During that time he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and then its Biological Secretary from 1976 to 1983."]}, {"page": "Arthur Wilson", "response": ["*Arthur Wilson (rugby union) (1886\u20131917), British rugby union player and Olympic medalist", "*Arthur Wilson (gynaecologist) (1888\u20131947), Australian gynaecologist, obstetrician and Australian rules footballer ", "*Arthur Wilson (English footballer) (1908\u20132000), Southampton, West Ham United and Chester footballer", "*Arthur Wilson (administrator) (born 1944), Australian administrator and historian associated with the Fitzroy Football Club", "*Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer) (1842\u20131921), English Admiral and First Sea Lord", "*Sergeant Arthur Wilson, character from the British television sitcom Dad's Army", "*Arthur Wilson (writer) (1595\u20131652), English writer", "*Arthur Wilson (shipping magnate) (1836\u20131909), English ship-owner from Hull", "*Arthur Wilson (judge) (1837\u20131915), English judge", "*Arthur Wilson (Western Australian politician) (1869\u20131948), former Western Australian politician", "*Arthur Wilson (crystallographer) (1914\u20131995), Canadian crystallographer (Cambridge and Birmingham)", "* Arthur Wilson 1, mountaineer on the 1969 British Kilimanjaro Expedition", "* Arthur Wilson 2, mountaineer on the 1969 British Kilimanjaro Expedition"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["***Arthur Wilson (writer) (1595\u20131652), English writer", "***Arthur Wilson (shipping magnate) (1836\u20131909), English ship-owner from Hull", "***Arthur Wilson (judge) (1837\u20131915), English judge", "***Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer) (1842\u20131921), English Admiral and First Sea Lord", "***Arthur Wilson (Western Australian politician) (1869\u20131948), former Western Australian politician", "***Arthur Wilson (rugby union) (1886\u20131917), British rugby union player and Olympic medalist", "***Arthur Wilson (Australian rules footballer) (1888\u20131947), Australian Rules footballer", "***Arthur Wilson (cricketer) (1894\u20131977), English cricketer", "***Arthur Wilson (English footballer) (1908\u20132000), Southampton, West Ham United and Chester footballer", "***Arthur Wilson (crystallographer) (1914\u20131995), Canadian crystallographer (Cambridge and Birmingham)", "*Dooley Wilson (Arthur Wilson, 1886\u20131953), American actor and singer", "*Sergeant Arthur Wilson in television comedy Dad's Army"]}, {"page": "Mary Fulbrook", "response": ["Fulbrook was born Mary Jean Alexandra Wilson on 28 November 1951 to Arthur Wilson and Harriett C.
