Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (\u00a315,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free transfer from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (\u00a335,000 from Doncaster Rovers, having also signed him whilst at Doncaster). Aiming for a promotion push in the 1986\u201387 campaign, Leeds were stuck in mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for \u00a3840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for \u00a3110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for \u00a372,000 and \u00a3200,000 respectively. A 2\u20131 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs by the end of the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3\u20132 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1\u20130 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew's.

Three executive boxes were also purchased from Newcastle United, whilst facilities were opened to the local community. Manager John Rudge made a \u00a340,000 offer for Bristol City's left-sided midfielder Alan Walsh, which was rejected. He also made inquiries for Nigel Gleghorn and Marc North. Ray Walker put in a transfer request, which was rejected. Rudge's first purchase of the season was Sunderland's left-sided midfielder Paul Atkinson, with a tribunal setting the fee at \u00a320,000; Rudge stated that he \"has the ability to produce the sort of crosses that win games\". His next target was a striker, though he had a \u00a370,000 bid for Hull City's Andy Saville rejected. Attempts to capture Imre Varadi, Wayne Biggins, Keith Bertschin, Andy Jones, and John Pearson all failed. Ian Moores began training with the club, but was not offered a contract. Despite interest from at least three other clubs (particularly Mansfield Town), Rudge signed Ron Futcher, Bradford City's top-scorer, for a \u00a335,000 fee. The veteran striker said \"I could have done better for myself elsewhere, but Vale have a lot more potential.\" Another new arrival was young Brighton & Hove Albion goalkeeper Trevor Wood on a free transfer. The Vale were unbeaten in their seven pre-season friendlies, beating second tier rivals Stoke City 1\u20130 in the process. They also recorded wins over Newcastle Town (6\u20131), Brandon (2\u20131), Spennymoor (3\u20130), and Kidderminster Harriers (4\u20130), and drew 2\u20132 with Walsall and 1\u20131 with Crewe Alexandra.
