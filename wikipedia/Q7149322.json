However, his time at Charlton was short-lived as Clarke initially struggled; having made only one start. In March 2012, he was loaned out to Crawley Town until the end of the season.

He was named in the initial 35-man squad for the Four Nations Tournament in May 2006, but did not make the final 18-man squad. Donaldson finally made the cut when being named in the final 16-man squad for the team to play the Netherlands in November 2006. He made his debut in this match, coming on as a substitute in the last 15 minutes, in which he set up Craig Mackail-Smith for the final goal of a 4\u20131 victory. This result meant England won the inaugural European Challenge Trophy, topping the table with maximum points. Donaldson was included in the squad to play Northern Ireland in February 2007, although York manager McEwan contemplated withdrawing Donaldson from the squad, after his comeback for York against Altrincham in February 2007. Donaldson eventually started against Northern Ireland, but was substituted after 50 minutes for Paul Benson, who scored England's only goal two minutes after coming on in a 3\u20131 defeat.

He took charge of the final two matches of 2003\u201304 as Dagenham finished in 13th position. With less money at his disposal than his predecessor Garry Hill, Still began overhauling the squad, signing players from further down the league pyramid such as Craig Mackail-Smith, Shane Blackett, Scott Griffiths and Glen Southam, while allowing 15 players to leave. The club finished in 11th place in 2004\u201305. Still continued building his squad, signing Carshalton Athletic winger Sam Saunders and White Ensign striker Paul Benson, who was playing in the Essex Olympian League \u2013 the eleventh tier of English football. In October 2005, Still was offered the manager's job at Bristol Rovers, but rejected it stating that he was \"very settled\" at Dagenham. The club struggled for consistency through 2005\u201306, finishing the season in tenth, albeit with fewer points than in 2004\u201305. The Dagenham board, who had faith in Still's long-term plans for the club, offered him a new two-year contract, which he signed in July 2006.", "In 2009\u201310, Still was named League Two Manager of the Month for August 2009, in which Dagenham won four of their opening five matches and took an early lead at the top of the League Two table. Still led the club to their then-highest ever finish in their history \u2013 seventh in League Two \u2013 which allowed them to qualify for the play-offs. His team beat Morecambe 7\u20132 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final, which included a 6\u20130 win in the first leg. He led the team out on 30 May 2010 at Wembley Stadium to face Rotherham United for a place in League One. The Daggers won 3\u20132, with goals from Paul Benson, Danny Green and Jon Nurse, and were promoted to the third tier of English football for the first time. Still won the BBC London Sports Personality of the Year award for this achievement, beating Premier League winning manager Carlo Ancelotti and European Athletics Championship goal medallist Mo Farah, amongst others. Still underwent an operation during the middle of the season to cure an ongoing problem with kidney stones and gallstones; this kept him from attending a number of matches, leaving assistant manager Terry Harris in charge.", "He has won praise for his man-management and talent spotting skills, especially his ability to discover young players in non-League football at the sixth tier and below, develop them and then sell them \u2013 often for a significant profit. Players that Still has developed that have gone on to play at a higher level include Marlon King, Craig Mackail-Smith, Paul Benson, Sam Saunders, Danny Green, and Dwight Gayle. Dagenham & Redbridge managing director Steve Thompson has stated that Still's ability to do this kept the club consistently able to compete while operating on a far smaller budget than its rivals. Still's reputation for nurturing talent, combined with his vast array of contacts within the game gained through decades of coaching, have also led to highly rated young players from Premier League academies joining his teams on loan. Examples include Marlon Pack and Matt Ritchie at Dagenham, and Cameron McGeehan, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu and Elliot Lee at Luton."]}, {"page": "List of Swindon Town F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Alan Connell (12) Paul Benson (12)"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Football Conference", "response": ["| 1||align=left| Paul Benson ||align=left| Dagenham & Redbridge ||28||0||0||2||30"]}, {"page": "Josh McQuoid", "response": ["On 29 June 2015, McQuoid signed for League Two club Luton Town on a three-year contract.
