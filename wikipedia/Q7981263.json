In the 13th century, a legend arose that Joseph of Arimathea was the founder of Glastonbury Abbey. Early accounts of Joseph at Glastonbury focus on his role as the evangelist of Britain rather than as the custodian of the Holy Grail, but from the 15th century, the Grail became a more prominent part of the legends surrounding Glastonbury.Wood 2012, p. 53\u201355. Interest in Glastonbury resurged in the late 19th century, inspired by renewed interest in the Arthurian legend and contemporary spiritual movements centered on ancient sacred sites.Wood 2012, p. 55\u201360. In the late 19th century, John Goodchild hid a glass bowl near Glastonbury; a group of his friends, including Wellesley Tudor Pole, retrieved the cup in 1906 and promoted it as the original Holy Grail.Wood 2012, p. 57\u201358.

It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the Great Seal of the United States, designed in 1782, proclaims a \"new order of ages\", while in the 1980s the Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev proclaimed that \"all mankind is entering a new age\". The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward.  In 1864 the American Swedenborgian Warren Felt Evans published The New Age and its Message, while in 1907 Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson began editing a weekly journal of Christian liberalism and socialism titled The New Age. The concept of a coming \"new age\" that would be inaugurated by the return to Earth of Jesus Christ was a theme in the poetry of Wellesley Tudor Pole (1884-1968) and of Johanna Brandt (1876-1964), and then also appeared in the work of the British-born American Theosophist Alice Bailey (1880-1949), featuring prominently in such titles as Discipleship in the New Age (1944) and Education in the New Age (1954).

Wellesley Tudor Pole had been pursuing investigations in the Middle East and visited Constantinople where he heard of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in 1908 and soon became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed. The woman known as Isabella Grinevskaya moved from Odessa Ukraine after gaining some notability as a playwright to Constantinople and after meeting \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 on a trip to Egypt became a member of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.  In 1913, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's son and successor, commented that the religion was spreading into the interior of Turkey. S\u00fcleyman Nazif is a prominent poet and thinker from Turkey at the turn of the 20th century who was challenged to learn more of the religion while in Paris, by the poet Catulle Mend\u00e8s. Investigating the religion, including meeting with \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 a number of times and becoming an admirer of Tahirih, Nazif wrote about various facets of these encounters and history in several books - though they contain errors they can be considered an important alternative source on early views of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed history. Martha Root, a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teacher, visited Turkey in 1927, 1929, and 1932. Following the rise of Secularism in Turkey, the Turkish government, around 1928, decided to order the police in the town of Smyrna to conduct a close investigation into the purpose, the character and the effects of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed activity in that town. Mentioned in the morning papers the next day, the chairman of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Local Spiritual Assembly of Constantinople travelled to offer the necessary explanations to the authorities concerned but he and the rest of the assembly were all arrested, and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature in their homes was seized.

This was the initial event of a series of journeys he took. Sometime from late September to mid-August 1910 until the winter of 1913, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 would travel from Egypt to various countries and back in two successive trips \u2013 first to Europe, second to America (United States and Canada) and back to Europe on the return trip. Before, between, and on return he would stop in Egypt. See \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's journeys to the West. Wellesley Tudor Pole became a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed after traveling to Egypt to interview him in November 1910. In the same year, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 referred to an early Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Local Spiritual Assembly of Cairo.

Louis Gregory visited \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 at Ramleh in 1911. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was about to make long travels to the West. Just before \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's first trip, a message from Lady Blomfield extended an invitation for \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 when he was in London. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 then set sail 11 August 1911, reached as far as London, and returned in early December to rest for the winter. His next trip was more extensive and reached to California. He left 25 March 1912 and returned 17 June 1913 and on return stayed in Egypt almost six months before returning to Haifa/Akka. Upon his return he gave a number of talks. These were eventually published as \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in Egypt. After \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 returned to Haifa, Martha Root stayed there for six months in 1915. One of the earliest Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of the west and a Disciple of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, Lua Getsinger, died in 1916 and she was buried in Egypt.

During World War I Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Port Said were pillaged twice. Meanwhile, Tudor Pole was stationed in Egypt and was directly involved in addressing the concerns raised by Ottoman threats against \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. As the battle lines advanced from Egypt through Palestine, the Ottomans had threatened that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 would be killed if the Ottomans had been forced to leave the region. This threat was taken seriously by the British Military who then sought to make his protection part of the plans for the Palestine theatre.
