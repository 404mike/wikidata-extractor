He was educated at Harrow, Charterhouse School, Bartlett School of Architecture London University, and Regent Street Polytechnic School of Architecture. \nScott was the designer of three churches which have been given the status of Grade II listed buildings: St Mark's Church, Biggin Hill, the Our Lady Help of Christians Church, Tile Cross, Birmingham and the Church of St Thomas More, Sheldon, also in Birmingham.\nScott worked for the family firm, retiring in 1999. Amongst other works he was responsible for the West Wing of the Guildhall, London (1974) and the Guildhall Art Gallery 1999. Both buildings contrast with the Gothic architecture of the Guildhall (which his father was in charge of restoring after World War II), the West Wing being in a modernist tradition, and the Art Gallery being in the post-modern tradition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Biggin Hill", "response": ["The most architecturally noteworthy building within Biggin Hill is St Mark's Church, Church Road \u2013 'the moving church' - designed by Richard Gilbert Scott.
