The reports made clear that the films had been viewed in the family home at a time when Smith was not present, and that she had given her husband, Richard Timney, a \"real ear-bashing\" over the incident. This and other cases prompted calls for reform of the additional costs allowance and a new system of payments to be introduced.  Gordon Brown supported her and said she had done nothing wrong. However, Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, was critical of her actions, stating that naming her sister's spare bedroom as her main home was \"near fraudulent\".

Cox registered the payments late, variously between two and seven months after the deadline; he said that he had omitted to prioritise the rule in the midst of an intense political and professional schedule. When first registering the payments, in September 2015, Cox drew attention to and apologised to the Registrar for his omission, referring himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner, and stepped down from the committee. The Commissioner and the Committee accepted that the payments had not in fact given rise to any conflicts of interest and that the failure to register the payments within 28 days had thus had no practical effect. Alistair Graham, the former Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, criticised the lack of punishment and called for a complete reform, while Martin Bell said the Committee on Standards had a long history of inflicting light punishment, which showed that the House was incapable of regulating itself."]}, {"page": "Maria Miller", "response": ["Alistair Graham, who chaired the Committee on Standards in Public Life during 2003\u201307, said Miller's position as Culture Secretary would be \"untenable\" if Hudson found her guilty, recalling the \"very similar\" 2009 case of Tony McNulty, who resigned his ministerial positions.
