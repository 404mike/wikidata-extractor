This left City at the top of the Third Division table and Brian Clark had scored 11 goals in 7 matches while Atyeo had scored two hat-tricks in only five games in a 5\u20131 win v Walsall on 29 August 1964 and a 4\u20130 win v Southend United on 8 September. After this Bristol City remained near the top but never again reached the top two promotion positions until the final two games of the season. The final run in of 12 wins in the last 15 matches clinching promotion on goal average on the final day with a 2\u20130 win v Oldham Athletic in front of a crowd of 28,248 on 24 April 1965. Atyeo scored six goals in the final three games including 4 goals in a 5\u20131 win at Shrewsbury Town on 19 April 1965. Brian Clark ended the season as ever present and top scorer with 24 goals. Atyeo scored 23 goals but made fewer appearances playing in only 38 matches. Atyeo began the season at centre forward flanked by inside forwards Clark and \"Shadow\" Williams. Williams was replaced for a spell in mid season by young Gerry Sharpe and then Williams was sold for \u00a311,000 to Rotherham United. This led to a switch with Atyeo reverting to inside right, Clark moving to inside left and utility player Terry Bush stepping up from half back to centre forward to good effect scoring eight times in the run in to promotion. Atyeo was captain of this promotion winning team."]}, {"page": "Severnside derby", "response": ["| Gerry Sharpe ", "|Gerry Sharpe"]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Football League", "response": ["|35||align=left|  Gerry Sharpe ||align=left| Bristol City ||10||0||1||\u2014||11"]}]}}
