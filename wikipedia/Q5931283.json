The right-hand battalion of the 164th Brigade was held up by uncut wire at the south-western edge of Guillemont, where the infantry tried to dig in beyond grenade range, before retiring to their jumping-off trenches. The left-hand battalion broke through on either side of the quarry at the west side of Guillemont and entered the village; reinforcements sent to hold the captured front line behind them were bombed out by a German counter-attack from the south.

Beginning on 3 January 1916, the division's former units assembled near Hallencourt. This included the arrival of the North Lancashire Brigade, which had been renumbered as the 164th Brigade in 1915. The Liverpool and South Lancashire Brigades were reformed, but numbered as the 165th and the 166th Brigades respectively. On 27 January 1916, the reformation was completed, and Major-General Hugh Jeudwine was assigned as commander. These experienced troops were no longer completely made up of the men who had left in 1915, due to casualties and new drafts. By the end of March, the division was still 3,000 men under establishment. The division comprised three brigades: the 164th Brigade, consisting of the 1/4th Battalion, King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) (1/4KORL), the 1/4th Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment (1/4LR), the 2/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (2/5LF) and the 1/8th (Irish) Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (Liverpool Irish); the 165th Brigade consisted of the 1/5th Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (1/5KR), the 1/6KR, the 1/7KR, and the 1/9KR; and the 166th Brigade consisted of the 1/10th (Scottish) Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (Liverpool Scottish), the 1/5th Battalion, the South Lancashire Regiment (1/5SL), the 1/5th Battalion, King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) (1/5KORL) and the 1/5th Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment (1/5LR). During 1916, Jeudwine adopted the Red Rose of Lancaster as the divisional emblem, to foster county pride in the division.

Two days later there was an increase in German artillery fire and it was obvious that an attack was imminent. The divisional commander, Major-General Hugh Jeudwine, visited the battalion at midnight on 29 November and urged the men to 'Stand or fall at your posts'. When the attack came through the morning fog, with a bombardment of extreme intensity followed by ground attacks by the Richthofen 'Circus', the battalion was overwhelmed. While massed German infantry attacked its position, a 'box barrage' isolated the battalion and its headquarters, which were then surrounded and all survivors were captured. Its strength that morning had been 21 officers and 540 other ranks, and all that remained were a handful of officers and men left behind at the transport lines.
