In an introductory voiceover, Cook explains his thoughts and alludes towards a murder he may have committed; it is implied but not outright stated that he is avoiding capture after killing John Foster a few years back. He is now a drug dealer and has a semi-serious relationship with a woman named Emma (Esther Smith), but becomes mesmerised by Charlie (Hannah Britland), the girlfriend of local drug lord Louis (Liam Boyle) after he is asked to watch over her for a few days. After Louis brutally kills a man named Jason (Lucien Laviscount) for having an affair with Charlie, Cook flees Manchester, taking Emma with him. En route, Charlie calls Cook and begs him to take her with them. The three end up at Emma's family's old country home, in a remote part of the country. Not long after though, Louis arrives, explaining that he tracked their car. After Charlie refuses to go with him, the three leave the house and find Emma's parents' car abandoned, indicating they have been killed. The trio are stranded in the woods, where Louis catches up with and murders Emma. Seeing this, Cook decides he is done running, confronting Louis and beating him to a pulp. He declares, \"I'm Cook. You thought you could kill me? I'm fucking Cook.\" He helps Charlie escape and alerts the police to Louis. In a final voiceover, he ponders the significance of life and death and how it gets \u2018under your skin\u2019. His fate, like at the end of season 4, remains ambiguous."]}, {"page": "List of Skins characters", "response": ["| Esther Smith"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Short Film", "response": ["| Elephant || Nick Helm, Esther Smith "]}, {"page": "List of television programs in which one character was played by multiple actors", "response": ["* Cuckoo.
