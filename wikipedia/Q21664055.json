Billinghurst's first stint in Holloway Prison was for smashing a window on Henrietta Street during this campaign, for which she was sentenced to one month's hard labour. The prison authorities were confused regarding her sentence to one month's hard labour and gave her no extra work. She was befriended by the many other prisoners, including Dr. Alice Stewart Ker, who, when Billinghurst was released, had her smuggle a letter out to Ker's daughter.

She went to London, together with Annie Kenney, whom she had inspired with her \"sledgehammer of logic and cold reason\" as a speaker, to work on increasing support for the movement. In 1905, Keir Hardie asked to her become the second full-time organiser for the WSPU's activities with the Labour Party. Billington organised publicity and demonstrations, including on 25 April 1906, unveiling a 'Votes for Women' banner from the Ladies Gallery during the debate in the House of Commons to jeers and shouts. In June 1906, Billington was arrested in a fracas outside of the Chancellor of the Exchequer H. H. Asquith's home and accused of striking and kicking a police officer who arrested her. Billington claimed that the police officer had grabbed her aggressively, causing her bruises, and an inflammation to her throat. She refused to recognise the authority of the magistrates' court as women had played no part in defining the laws that it operated by. She was sentenced to a fine of \u00a310 or two months in prison, and refused to pay the fine or have it paid for her. She became the first suffragette to be incarcerated in Holloway Prison. However, against her wishes, she was released within days after her fine was paid anonymously. Later that month, she travelled to organise the WSPU in Scotland, when her oratory impressed and influenced Janie Allan. She met Frederick Lewis Greig (1875/76\u20131961) in Scotland, and married him on 8 February 1907, in Glasgow. They agreed to adopt a common surname of Billington-Greig and to be equals in the marriage.  Before that she had helped WSPU canvassing against the Liberal Party candidate in the 1906 Huddersfield by-election with Emmeline Pankhurst and Annie Kenney, impressing local activist Hannah Mitchell. However, she became unhappy that her suggestions for the direction of the organisation were being dismissed, and disputes with the Pankhursts preceded her parting ways with the WSPU. Billington-Greig's surviving notes writings from 1906 to 1907 demonstrate her views being refined, with her theory coming to encompass a demand for full equality between the sexes, and a rejection of poor tactics to achieve positive outcomes."]}, {"page": "Ethel Moorhead", "response": ["She had become known as the first Scottish suffragette to be forcibly fed, while imprisoned in Calton Jail Edinburgh under the care of Dr Hugh Ferguson Watson. Having been force fed more than 25 times, over a week or so, Moorhead become seriously ill with double pneumonia, and had even been given absolution by the prison chaplain. Her solicitor intervened and she was released into the care of Dr Grace Cadell, a fellow activist in the suffrage movement. Arriving at Cadell's home, 145 Leith Walk, 150 police had been awaiting a demonstration, but none arose, although a call had gone out earlier in the Dundee Courier letters page from Emily Pankhurst and Lila Clunas and in The Scotsman an advert inviting 'thousands' to march from Charlotte Square to Calton Prison, along Princes Street in protest at Moorhead's treatment (but she had already been released by the set time). Despite the many well wishers, she was so weak that she only allowed visits from Dr Mabel Jones or her Broughty Ferry friend, Enid Rennie, who had written to Dr. Devon who had been the lead prison doctor who latterly conducted the force feeding, that it was  'a permanent blot on the record of so many fights for liberty in which Scotland has hitherto born a noble part'. Elizabeth Gauld, Janie Allan and others wrote to object and his responses showed he would prefer to consider her 'mad'.  The arson at Whitekirk Church was said by Allan to be a revenge for Moorhead's treatment. Her prison force feeding experiences - duly related to the presscaused much protest at the cruelty involved. Her treatment and resultant activism was raised in Parliament, the Secretary of State asked on two occasions about the treatment and 'her life being endangered'.
