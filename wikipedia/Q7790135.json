He is best remembered for his work at Oxford, including the Oxford Military College at Cowley, the university's Examination Schools, most of Hertford College (including the Bridge of Sighs over New College Lane), much of Brasenose College, ranges at Trinity College and Somerville College, the City of Oxford High School for Boys, and the Acland Nursing Home.\nMuch of his career was devoted to the architecture of education, and he worked extensively for various schools, notably Giggleswick and his own alma mater Brighton College. Jackson designed the former town hall in Tipperary Town, Ireland. He also worked on many parish churches and the college chapel at the University of Wales, Lampeter. He is also famous for designing the chapel (amongst other things) at Radley College.\nHe was educated at Brighton College and then Wadham College, Oxford, of which he wrote a history, before being articled as a pupil to Sir George Gilbert Scott.\nJackson was a prolific author of carefully researched works in architectural history, often illustrated with sketches made during his extensive travels. Jackson's travels in Dalmatia, in which he was accompanied by his intrepid wife, would result in Dalmatia, the Quarnero and Istria with Cettigne in Montenegro and the island of Grado (3 volumes), published by the Clarendon Press, Oxford, in 1887. It remains today a fundamental source of knowledge of the geography, art, architecture and social life of Dalmatia in those years.\nHe and Norman Shaw edited \"Architecture, A Profession or an Art\" published in 1892, to which William H. White replied by publishing \"The Architect and his artists, an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art\".\nThis had been part of the course of events which resulted in the passing of the Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938 which established the statutory Register of Architects and monopolistic restrictions on the use of the vernacular word \"architect\", imposed with threat of penalty on prosecution for infringement.\nIn 1889, Jackson was elected as a member of the Art Workers' Guild, and went to be elected Master of the Guild in 1896. In 1892, he was elected as an associate member of the Royal Academy before becoming an elected full member of the Academy in 1896, and holding roles of senior Royal Academician  and treasurer.In 1919, Jackson wrote a collection of supernatural stories, Six Ghost Stories. These stories were written under the influence of M. R. James, and Jackson expressed admiration for James' work in the book's introduction.A stone memorial tablet to Sir Thomas was erected in the chapel of Brighton College, part of which he had built as a First World War memorial in 1922\u201323. For that school's chapel he had also designed many memorials during the 1880s and 1890s. The other concentrated group of mural tablets by Jackson is to be found in the antechapel of Wadham College in Oxford.\nJackson's pupils and assistants included Evelyn Hellicar.\nJackson was created a Baronet, of Eagle House in Wimbledon in the County of Surrey, on 10 February 1913.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerville College, Oxford", "response": ["The original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called House) was built in 1826 and purchased from St John's College in 1880 amid fears that the men's colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes. The house could only accommodate seven of the twelve students who came up to Oxford in the first year. In 1881, Sir Thomas Graham Jackson was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, Walter Cave added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the Eleanor Smith Cottages were added, adjoining Walton House."]}, {"page": "Bath Abbey", "response": ["Major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed. Scott's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front. Gilbert-Scott also designed the finely-carved pews in the nave, and are among the finest examples of Church seating from the period, and have been described as \"one of the most magnificent and extensive suites of Victorian church seating in the country\".", "In the 1920s Thomas Graham Jackson redesigned the Norman Chapel into a War Memorial Chapel, now Gethsemane Chapel, and added a cloister.

His energy, good connections and longevity created the modern college as it is today. Boyd's name appears carved on the landmark Bridge of Sighs, and he is commemorated by a memorial in the Chapel (to the left of the chancel) and a portrait in the Hall (at the west end of High Table). Boyd's partnership with the architect Thomas Graham Jackson brought about the expansion of the college and its endowment with its iconic 'Anglo-Jackson' buildings. In 1887, Jackson began work on the Gatehouse, the Hall and its spiral staircase, and the north range of the Old Quad. In 1901, Jackson started building the college's site on the northern side of New College Lane. By 1908, he had completed a new Chapel, which he declared to be his favourite work. Eventually, after much opposition, he built the Bridge of Sighs, linking the Old and New Quads across New College Lane, in 1913.", "The Old Quadrangle (known as Old Quad or OB Quad, for Old Buildings) is, as the name suggests, the oldest and the original quadrangle.

Most of the New Buildings are early 20th-century designs by Jackson, except the slightly later frontage onto Holywell Street, on the northern side of the quad.

They attracted the attention of travel writers like 17th-century Jacob Spon and Sir George Wheler, and 18th-century writers Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who labeled their poems as \"Morlackisch\". In 1793, at the carnival in Venice, a play about Morlachs, Gli Antichi Slavi (\"antique Slavs\"), was performed, and in 1802 it was reconceived as a ballet Le Nozze dei Morlacchi. At the beginning of the 20th century, still seen as relics from the primitive past and a byword for barbarous people, they may have inspired science fiction novelist H. G. Wells in his depiction of the fictional Morlocks. Thomas Graham Jackson described Morlach women as half-savages wearing \"embroidered leggings thet give them the appearance of Indian squaws\". In the 20th century, Alice Moque, as did many other women travelers, in her 1914 travelogue Delightful Dalmatia emphasized the \"barbaric gorgeousness\" of the sight of Morlach women and men in their folk costumes, which \"made Zara's Piazza look like a stage setting\", and regretted the coming of new civilization."]}, {"page": "Thomas G.

Many, including Morris wanted the guild to be a more active force and put forward a Councillor to the London County Council to advise on the protection of historical buildings and advocate craftsmanship. However Graham Jackson was against politics and declared the guild should not be:  Graham Jackson decided training the next generation of artists was more important and created the Art Student Guild, which would go onto become the Junior Guild.
