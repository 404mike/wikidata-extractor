Byrne and Ford had previously starred in Force 10 from Navarone (1978), in which they also respectively played a German and an American. Kevork Malikyan portrays Kazim, the leader of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, an organization that protects the Holy Grail. Malikyan had impressed Spielberg with his performance in Midnight Express (1978) and would have auditioned for the role of Sallah in Raiders of the Lost Ark had a traffic jam not delayed his meeting with the director. Robert Eddison appears as the Grail Knight, the guardian of the Grail who drank from the cup of Christ during the Crusades and is immortal as long as he stays within the temple. Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing in a few films since the 1930s (including a supporting role in Peter Ustinov's 1948 comedy Vice Versa). Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his return to film, often asking if he had performed correctly. Laurence Olivier was originally considered to play the Grail Knight, but he was too ill and died the same year in which the film was released."]}, {"page": "Midnight Express (film)", "response": ["* Kevork Malikyan as The Prosecutor"]}, {"page": "1989 in film", "response": ["| Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade || Paramount Pictures / Lucasfilm || Steven Spielberg (director); Jeffrey Boam (screenplay); Harrison Ford, Sean Connery, Denholm Elliott, Alison Doody, John Rhys-Davies, Julian Glover, River Phoenix, Michael Byrne, Kevork Malikyan, Robert Eddison, Richard Young, Alexei Sayle, Alex Hyde-White, Paul Maxwell, Isla Blair, Vernon Dobtcheff, Bradley Gregg, Frederick Jaeger, Eugene Lipinski || Action, Adventure || Live action"]}, {"page": "1983 in film", "response": ["| Trenchcoat || Buena Vista Distribution || Michael Tuchner (director); Jeffrey Price, Peter S.
