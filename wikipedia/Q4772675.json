[Terriford] presupposes that he knows who is bad and who is good in this complicated world... The presupposition is social: the one took your mother out to dances [in the play, the Prime Minister and Terriford's mother had dated], the other was educated half in Buda and half in Pest. To whom would you give the secret of the burning glass, chum?... all the characters except [the enemy agent] Hardlip devote themselves to proclaiming the unspoken assumptions of the English upper classes.... What purports to be a play of ideas conveys a country-house ethic of the necessity for having the right chaps in the right places... This solution solves nothing, excites no question, stimulates no reaction. It is not even dramatic. This is not what the theatre is for.\""]}, {"page": "Hartley, Anthony", "response": ["#redirectAnthony Hartley"]}]}}
