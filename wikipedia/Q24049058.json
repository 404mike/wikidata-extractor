He was brought up in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire and educated at the University of Oxford.\nHis first solo show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was French Exchange which was nominated by The Times as one of the \"Top five of the Free Fringe 2014\". It retold the story of a GCSE French exchange trip in a comedy storytelling style.  \nThat year, he also appeared as an aspiring detective called Ridley in a 2014 episode of Jonathan Creek, entitled \"The Letters of Septimus Noone\".\nIn 2015, his show Lance, a similarly biographical storytelling piece about his childhood hero, Lance Armstrong, was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award. He received the nomination again in 2016 for his show Maestro, which used his interest in classical music and attempt to write a symphony as a metaphor for his life. In 2018, Hodgson launched a new show, 75, at the Fringe. It used the 1975 referendum on Europe as a means of exploring the contemporary Brexit debate, with Hodgson impersonating many famous UK politicians from the 1970s. He was nominated for the Comedy Award for a third time, before taking the show on the road from January 2019. This formed the basis for his Channel 4 comedy documentary How Europe Stole My Mum.\nHe appeared as Ian Lavender in the one-off BBC Two drama We're Doomed! The Dad's Army Story. Hodgson also starred in The Lentil Sorters on BBC Radio 4, presented Kieran Hodgson's Earworms for Radio 4 in August 2017 and made appearances in Siblings on BBC Three, Count Arthur Strong on BBC Two and the film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa.In 2017  Hodgson first appeared as Gordon, the new boyfriend of Ian, in the BBC Scotland television comedy series Two Doors Down, a role that he reprised in the 2019 series.Outside of his comedy career Hodgson is a keen musician. He is a fan of romantic music, in particular the music of Gustav Mahler, and this was the topic of his stand-up show Maestro. Hodgson learned both the violin and piano as a child, and continues to play the violin now. He played in the North London Sinfonia for eight years, from 2012-2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jonathan Creek", "response": ["Many well-known actors have appeared in the series, including Bob Monkhouse, Rik Mayall (who had been considered to play Jonathan) and Jack Dee who are better known for their comedy roles.

Having become King at such a young age, Maxi constantly flouts his title and power for trivial reasons which his pilot, Captain Martin Crieff, says would not make him popular in the long-term (based on his own experiences).
