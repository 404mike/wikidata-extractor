She was the first person to swim the Straits of Gibraltar and the first British woman to swim the English channel. The name of Mercedes Gleitze was used to market Rolex's new waterproof case, the \"Oyster\".  She established endurance records for swimming including a record of 46 hours in 1932.

In 1927, British swimmer Mercedes Gleitze swam across the English Channel with an Oyster on her necklace, becoming the first Rolex ambassador.

However, as John E. Brozek (author of The Rolex Report: An Unauthorized Reference Book for the Rolex Enthusiast) points out in his article \"The Vindication Swim, Mercedes Gleitze and Rolex take the plunge\", some doubts were cast on her achievement when a hoaxer claimed to have made a faster swim only four days later. Hence Gleitze attempted a repeat swim with extensive publicity on 21 October, dubbed the \"Vindication Swim\". For promotional purposes, Hans Wilsdorf offered her one of the earliest Rolex Oysters if she would wear it during the attempt. After more than 10 hours, in water that was much colder than during her first swim, she was pulled from the sea semi-conscious seven miles short of her goal. Although she did not complete the second crossing, a journalist for The Times wrote \"Having regard to the general conditions, the endurance of Miss Gleitze surprised the doctors, journalists and experts who were present, for it seemed unlikely that she would be able to withstand the cold for so long. It was a good performance\". As she sat in the boat, the same journalist made a discovery and reported it as follows: \"Hanging round her neck by a ribbon on this swim, Miss Gleitze carried a small gold watch, which was found this evening to have kept good time throughout\". When examined closely, the watch was found to be dry inside and in perfect condition. One month later, on 24 November 1927, Wilsdorf launched the Rolex Oyster watch in the United Kingdom with a full front page Rolex advert in the Daily Mail. The Vienna Herald described the 1969 Apollo moon landing as: 'an event almost as significant as the time a woman swam most of the English Channel with a waterproof watch on.'"]}, {"page": "List of sports films", "response": ["|Biopic of Mercedes Gleitze who in 1927 became the first British woman to swim the English Channel."]}, {"page": "Heacham", "response": ["On 29 July 1929, Mercedes Gleitze became the first woman to swim The Wash, completing the crossing on a third attempt.
