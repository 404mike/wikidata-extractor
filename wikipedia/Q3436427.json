During his lengthy service for both the East India Company and the British government, Farquhar gained a reputation as an efficient and ambitious administrator and he notably served as Lieutenant-Governor of Prince of Wales Island (Penang Island) from January 1804 to 1805 and as governor of \u00cele de Bourbon, now known as R\u00e9union from 1810 to 1811.\nHe was the 1st Governor of Mauritius from 4 December 1810 to 20 May 1823. During his tenure on Mauritius, Farquhar became well known for his operations against French slave traders, having previously investigated the possibility of replacing slaves with paid Chinese labourers. After returning to Britain Farquhar, who was made a baronet in 1821, sat in Parliament for Newton and later for Hythe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Mauritius", "response": ["The British administration, which began with Robert Townsend Farquhar as governor, was followed by rapid social and economic changes.

This was followed by a commercial treaty. On 23 October 1817, Radama signed a treaty negotiated by former military general James Hastie that granted Radama a formal alliance with the British crown and its recognition of Radama as \"King of Madagascar\" in exchange for horses, uniforms and a pledge to abandon the export of slaves. The British were invited to establish a diplomatic mission on the island, and in 1820 Hastie was appointed to the role of British resident. The import of slaves from the African mainland continued, however, and remained Madagascar's primary import throughout Radama's reign and into the 1850s."]}, {"page": "Thomas Hamilton (writer)", "response": ["Some time after his return, Hamilton visited America, bringing back materials for a book on the Americans.

In 1881 the authorities in Seychelles suggested Farquhar, along with several other outer islands, be administered from Victoria in Seychelles rather than from Mauritius.

He was born at Thame in Oxfordshire on 12 December 1813.  He initially began to collect plants in his native United Kingdom and also in France. In 1856 Ayres was appointed by Queen Victoria to superintendency of quarantine on Flat Island, Mauritius under governor Robert Townsend Farquhar. Ayres is particularly well known for his extensive plant collections made while in this position. He is also credited for finding the first sub fossil remains of the dodo in 1860. From 1856 to 1863 he traveled through Madagascar, the Seychelles, and the Mascarenes to develop this rich collection of Indian Ocean plant specimens. These specimens are now in the herbaria collections of the Natural History Museum, London, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris.  In addition to collecting, Ayres catalogued and sketched the plants in the wild, as was common among nineteenth century naturalists.  He also planned to write a book about the flora of Mauritius, but he died from relapsing fever in his home in Port Louis on 30 April 1863 before the flora could be accomplished.
