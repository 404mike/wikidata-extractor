She was born in Carloway, Lewis, but she currently lives on the Isle of Skye.In interviews Primrose has stated that she has been singing since she was a small child, which is very typical in her family.  She won a gold medal in sean-n\u00f3s at the Royal National M\u00f2d in 1974 and an award at the 1978 Pan Celtic Festival, and, as was not common at the time, she took a degree in traditional Gaelic music, and she has been performing all around the world, especially in North America, Australia, New Zealand and in Europe.  For example, she was at the Smithsonian Folklife Music Festival in Washington, D.C. with Alison Kinnaird. Besides this, she was a member of Mac-Talla, and she has presented television and radio programmes. According to Cencrastus magazine, her first album \u00c0ite Mo Ghaoil became \"a classic for its generation\". It was re-released on CD in 1993. At the time, Temple had reportedly been told that \"no one was interested in that [Gaelic music]\".Besides her performance work, Primrose has been working at Sabhal M\u00f2r Ostaig since 1982, the year that the school began to offer full-time courses. At first she was a secretary, and since 1993 she has taught in the course Gaelic and Traditional Music (BA) and in short courses. She has complained that \"bias... resulted in some of Scotland's finest musicians being treated as little more than 'noble savages'\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Music of Scotland", "response": ["A more recent trend has been to fuse traditional Celtic with world music, rock and jazz (see Celtic fusion). This has been championed by musicians such as Shooglenifty, innovators of the house fusion acid croft, Peatbog Faeries, The Easy Club, jazz fusion bands, puirt \u00e0 beul mouth musicians Talitha MacKenzie and Martin Swan, pioneering singers Savourna Stevenson and Christine Primrose.

The Irish / Scottish album would highlight and explore the cultural cross-fertilisation of the vibrant musical traditions of Scotland & Ireland and the group would collaborate with many other leading traditional musicians and scholars. Mick Moloney (USA/Ireland), Nuala Kennedy (Ireland), Aaron Jones (Ireland), Christine Primrose (Scotland), Alison Kinnaird (Scotland) & Barry Gray (Australia) were due to be all on board, with more to follow. The band has been awarded Creative Scotland assistance for this project.
