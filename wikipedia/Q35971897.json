He performed in the United Kingdom and internationally (including in Israel, Singapore, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and other countries). He was a pioneer of one-to-one performance, in which an artist repeats and adapts a score for a performance for a single audience member, or audience-participant, and repeats the action serially across a run of several days. The process and outcomes in Howells' signature works were frequently modelled on activities associated with the service industries or the tertiary sector of the economy, such as washing the audience-participant's hair or clothes, or giving an audience-member a bath, replicating in some ways the labour of a hairdresser, laundry worker, or caregiver; or he appropriated and adapted intimate interpersonal experiences in carefully mediated situations, like talking around a script or score in a setting such as a Japanese rock garden in The Garden of Adrian (2009), or holding hands, listening to music, and spooning in silence in Held (2008).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bretton Hall College of Education", "response": ["*Adrian Howells"]}, {"page": "Borden Grammar School", "response": ["* Adrian Howells, performance artist"]}, {"page": "Theatre and Performance Research Association", "response": ["The TaPRA Prize for Editing was won in 2018 by Dee Heddon and Dominic Johnson for It\u2019s all Allowed: the Performances of Adrian Howells (Live Art Development Agency and Intellect, 2016), and, in 2019, by Richard Gough for the 100th issue of Performance Research journal."]}, {"page": "Adrian Howells (performance artist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Adrian Howells"]}]}}
