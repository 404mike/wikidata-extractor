Not allowed to make friends with other boys of his own age, he never learned to play games, and lived a solitary life, concentrating his mind on purely intellectual subjects. He matriculated in 1869 at the University of Edinburgh, where he made a special study of classics under Professors William Young Sellar and J. S. Blackie, while he began to study philosophy under Professor Campbell Fraser, in whose class and in that of Professor Henry Calderwood (on moral philosophy) he gained the highest prizes. After graduating M.A. at Edinburgh in 1875 with first-class honours in classics, Ritchie gained a classical exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, and won a first-class both in classical moderations (Michaelmas, 1875) and in the final classical school (Trinity term, 1878). In 1878 he became a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford and in 1881 a tutor. From 1882 to 1886 he was also a tutor at Balliol College. At Oxford Ritchie came under the influence of Thomas Hill Green and Arnold Toynbee, and it was there that the foundations were laid both for his interest in idealistic philosophy associated with the name of G. W. F. Hegel (see British idealism), and also of his strong bent toward practical politics; his political philosophy was dominated by the belief that practical action must be derived from principles."]}, {"page": "Sutherland", "response": ["* William Young Sellar (1825\u20131890), classical scholar"]}, {"page": "W.
