David was born in Aberystwyth, Wales.  His directorial credits include Compact, Z-Cars, The Pallisers and Doctor Who, for which he directed two stories in the Patrick Troughton era. While still an actor in the early 1960s, he had actually been suggested for the leading role in Doctor Who by his friend, the producer Rex Tucker, but this was vetoed by incoming series producer Verity Lambert who considered the actor too young for the role. David later stated that as he had recently starred in the Granada Television series Knight Errant and disliked the high public profile it brought him, he would not have been keen to take on another leading role anyway.  He died in London, leaving his widow actress Wendy Williams."]}, {"page": "North and South (Gaskell novel)", "response": ["In the first television adaptation (in 1966), Richard Leech played Mr. Thornton and Wendy Williams played Margaret Hale."]}, {"page": "Wendy Williams (disambiguation)", "response": ["Wendy Williams (born 1964) is an American radio and television personality.", "Wendy Williams may also refer to:", "*Wendy Williams (British actress) (1934\u20132019)", "*Wendy Williams (cricketer) (1942\u20132012), Welsh cricketer", "*Wendy Williams (diver) (born 1967), American Olympic diver", "* Wendy Williams: The Movie, a 2021 U.S. made-for-TV biopic", "* The Wendy Williams Show, a U.S. talk show", "* Wendy Williams (Home and Away), a character from the Australian soap opera Home and Away", "* The Wendy Williams Experience, a 2006 U.S. reality TV show"]}, {"page": "The Pallisers", "response": ["*Wendy Williams: Jane"]}, {"page": "Beau Geste (TV series)", "response": ["* Wendy Williams: Lady Brandon"]}, {"page": "Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)", "response": ["* Wendy Williams as Mrs Barnett"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1959", "response": ["|Crash Drive||Max Varnel||Dermot Walsh, Wendy Williams||Drama||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1960", "response": ["|Feet of Clay||Frank Marshall||Vincent Ball, Wendy Williams||Crime||"]}, {"page": "The Regiment (TV series)", "response": ["|Wendy Williams"]}, {"page": "Feet of Clay (1960 film)", "response": ["Feet of Clay is a 1960 British crime film directed by Frank Marshall, written by Mark Grantham, and starring Vincent Ball, Wendy Williams and Hilda Fenemore.BFI.org", "* Wendy Williams ...
