Unlike the original film, the American version received negative reviews and failed to find an audience. Donald Clarke of Irish Times concluded that a \"sound job\" by the cast \"can't quite shake the whiff of compromise that hangs around the project\". In 2016, Roberts reunited with Garry Marshall and reportedly received a $3 million fee for a four-day shoot, playing an accomplished author who gave her child for adoption, in the romantic comedy Mother's Day, which had a lackluster critical and commercial response. Her next film release was Jodie Foster's thriller Money Monster, in which she  starred as a television director,  alongside George Clooney and Jack O'Connell. Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald stated: \"It may be Hollywood melodrama but it's top of the range, giving Clooney and Roberts every opportunity to demonstrate the value of star power.\" The film made a respectable $93.3 million worldwide."]}, {"page": "1990", "response": ["** Jack O'Connell, English actor"]}, {"page": "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof", "response": ["The Young Vic's 2018 production, directed by Benedict Andrews, and starring Sienna Miller as Maggie, Jack O'Connell as Brick, Colm Meaney as Big Daddy, Lisa Palfrey as Big Mama, Hayley Squires as Mae, Brian Gleeson as Gooper, Richard Hansell as Doctor, and Michael J.
