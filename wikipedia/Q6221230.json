In reference to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when it was alleged that English women and girls were raped by Indian sepoys, many Britons living in India expressed great concern over the humiliation that British females would have to face appearing before Indian judges in the case of rape trials. The British press in India spread wild rumours about how Indian judges would abuse their power to establish harems which they would then fill with British females. The allegations that Indian judges could not be trusted in dealing with cases involving British females helped raise considerable support against the bill.

It has two major components. Part of it is a satirical comment on the educated class of Orissa of that time who used to imitate the lifestyle of the British. The significant part, however, is the author's tribute to eminent people of Orissa of that time such as Madhusudan Das, one of the foremost builders of modern Orissa, poet Madhusudan Rao, poet Nanda Kishore Bal and the British civil servants who did considerable work for development of Orissa and survival of Oriya language such as Thomas Edward Ravenshaw and John Beames.
