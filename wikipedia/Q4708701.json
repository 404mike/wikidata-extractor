He appears on the Rezillos' second single for Sire Records, featuring the songs \"(My Baby Does) Good Sculptures\" and \"Flying Saucer Attack\" and also on their first studio album Can't Stand The Rezillos. He took over the bass slot in the Rezillos whilst working as their saxophonist. He left The Rezillos after a British tour supporting The Ramones, although he did make a guest appearance at the Rezillos' final gig at the Glasgow Apollo, where he returned to his original role of saxophone player alongside his replacement on bass guitar, Simon Templar (born Simon Broomfield). This performance was captured on The Rezillos' live album, Mission Accomplished (But The Beat Goes On). He also appeared on the B-side of the single version of \"Top of The Pops\", playing saxophone on the instrumental track, \"20,000 Rezillos under the Sea\". This track itself was a re-imagining of the \"William Tell Overture\" by the classical composer Rossini.\nAfter leaving the Rezillos, he released one single in 1982 as William Mysterious with Alastair Donaldson on the independent Mezzanine label, \"Security of Noise\" b/w \"Alright\". After The Rezillos split up for the first time in 1978, former members became The Revillos, and Donaldson rejoined them in 1979 for the Rev Up LP where he once again played bass.After this final outing with The Rezillos he retired from recording and touring, but was still semi active in live work in his native Edinburgh up until his death on 18 June 2013. He is survived by a daughter, Ailsa, and a son, John, as well as his wife Ksenija Horvat.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 18", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Alastair Donaldson, Scottish bass player (b. 1955)"]}, {"page": "Donaldson", "response": ["*Alastair Donaldson (1955\u20132013), Scottish musician"]}, {"page": "The Rezillos", "response": ["The band started life at Edinburgh College of Art, where most of the Rezillos' original line-up were studying. During 1975 art students Jo Callis and Alan Forbes had been in a college group named The Knutsford Dominators, a party band playing 1950s and 60s rock and roll cover versions: Forbes was originally one of the group's two drummers. The Knutsford Dominators were short-lived, but Callis and Forbes wanted to carry on making music in a similar vein. The pair recruited local bass player Dave Smythe and fellow student Mark Sinclair Harris, who was studying architecture at the college, on second guitar, and formed their new band the Rezillos in March 1976. The band name was adapted from the name of a club called \"Revilos\" that appeared in the first issue of the DC Comics publication The Shadow in November 1973. At the start, Callis, Forbes and Harris shared vocal duties, but as all of them found it difficult to play an instrument and sing at the same time, Forbes switched to vocals full-time and was replaced on drums by Alasdair Paterson, another Edinburgh College of Art architecture student. By August 1976 the band had recruited saxophonist Alastair Donaldson, a good friend of Paterson who was an architecture student from neighbouring Heriot-Watt University taking some of his classes at the college, and who had previously played with Edinburgh folk rock band Silly Wizard. Forbes had also introduced two fashion design students named Sheilagh Hynd and Gail Jamieson (aka Gayle Warning) to the group as backing singers.David Smythe's personal website", "*Alastair Donaldson (William Mysterious) played bass on the Revillos' third single before returning to complete his architecture studies at University of Hull. While in Hull he released a solitary single titled \"Security of Noise\" on his own Mezzanine label in 1982, under the name William Mysterious & Alastair Donaldson. The single features Fay Fife and the Revettes on backing vocals. After finishing his degree he returned to work as an architect in Edinburgh, as well as playing occasional low-key solo gigs in the city.
