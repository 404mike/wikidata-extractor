Already an above average boy cricketer, he developed into one of the best young all-rounders under the coaching of Lionel Blaxland and Garnet Lee.

Gradually, they assembled a strong team and, by 1927, they had a decent side which finished fifth and commanded respect. Harry Elliott, Jim Hutchinson and Harry Storer junior all made their debuts in 1920 and, over the next five years, the team welcomed Leslie Townsend, Stan Worthington and Garnet Lee. Denis Smith, who has one of the longest first-class careers on record, first appeared in 1927. Albert Alderman began in 1928 and then the team really took shape as Derbyshire discovered Tommy Mitchell, Alf Pope, Bill Copson, Charlie Elliott and George Pope. From 1928 to 1933, the team was always in mid-table."]}]}}
