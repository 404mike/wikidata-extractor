Ciderman also appeared in Francis' own zine Funny Ha-Ha, and a one-off drawn by Se\u00e1n Doran. He also contributed to the local anthology Blast, which he edited an issue of.IPC head Bob Paynter gave him some pages to draw in Monster Fun, which led to work for Oink! (1986\u201388) for which he drew \"Cowpat County\" and \"Greedy Gorb\". Other titles he drew for included adult humour comics UT, Brain Damage, Electric Soup and Gas, Ray Zone's The 3-D Zone, and feminist magazine Spare Rib.
