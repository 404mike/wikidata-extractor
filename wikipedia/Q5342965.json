They were attacked and whilst Inspector Clarke received a fractured skull from which he eventually recovered, Wright was so badly hurt that he died shortly afterwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of cricket in the West Indies to 1918", "response": ["* September 1882 \u2013 British Guiana defeated Trinidad by an innings and 6 runs.
