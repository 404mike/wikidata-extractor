The corrugated iron building was originally used for an infant school. After the First World War, the building began to house the village Sunday School and weekly Evensong service. The church lacked an altar and organ; musical accompaniment was played on a harmonium. The church was expanded in the 1920s by the rector of Minchinhampton, who oversaw the installation of a piano and provided the use of a portable altar, and the building itself was extended in the 1930s. By the outbreak of the Second World War, the village had begun to fundraise to build a permanent church. The foundation stone was laid by Bishop of Gloucester Clifford Woodward in 1951, and the building completed the following October. The church was consecrated by Woodward's successor, Wilfred Askwith. The church is dedicated to St Barnabas, and now offers a Eucharist service on Sundays and Holy Communion on Wednesdays."]}]}}
