Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960. He suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle.

At Bart's suggestion, he next signed Reg Patterson (n\u00e9 Smith), whom he re-christened Marty Wilde, and who also rose to pop stardom in the UK.  Parnes developed a network of contacts within the British recording industry and entertainment business, with leading British songwriters providing songs for his growing stable of talent, and many of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s achieving success in the UK Singles Chart.  A flamboyant gay man, Parnes' approach was to select, and then groom, handsome young men who would be attractive to a teenage audience. He also gave them new stage names, which were rumoured to reflect what he considered to be their sexual characteristics.  Among those he managed with at least some degree of success were Billy Fury (originally Ron Wycherley), Vince Eager (Roy Taylor), Dickie Pride (Richard Knellar), Lance Fortune (Chris Morris), Duffy Power (Ray Howard), Johnny Gentle (John Askew), Terry Dene (Terence Williams), Nelson Keene (Malcolm Holland), and Georgie Fame (Clive Powell).  He also managed Tommy Bruce, as well as Joe Brown, who he unsuccessfully tried to persuade to change his name to Elmer Twitch.", "Parnes also promoted concerts, including the 1960 tour by Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran during which Cochran was killed in a road crash. Later the same year he hired the Silver Beetles, an early incarnation of the then-unknown Beatles, to back one of his singers, Johnny Gentle, on a short tour of Scotland. Although Gentle tried to persuade him to manage the group, Parnes decided not to do so. Parnes developed the idea of the package tour, for which his stars toured the country together in a bus, playing one-night stands around the country.

In April, a national concert tour started with The Temperance Seven, Chas McDevitt and Shirley Douglas and Bert Weedon, and this led to a concert tour starting on 29 April with Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, The Viscounts, Vince Eager, Mark Eden, Danny Storm, Buddy Britten and Dave Reid. Before the final show at the Tower Ballroom, New Brighton, Laurie Jay announced his departure. A drummer was needed that night, and they recruited Ringo Starr, who had just returned from Hamburg after playing for Rory Storm and The Hurricanes. Jay went into management, later becoming the manager for Billy Ocean and Shirley Bassey. On returning to London, Tommy Frost became The Echoes' new drummer. After this tour Hines also left for Hamburg again, and was replaced by Ray Murray on keyboards. By May 1962, the Echoes line up became Dave Burns (guitar), Tommy Frost (drums), Ray Murray (keyboards), and Douggie Reece (bass). The Echoes performed a summer season in Douglas, Isle of Man in the \"Star Parade of 1962\", a rock and roll concert at The Crescent Pavilion. During the day they were required to play at The Palace Ballroom, playing relief for Ronnie Aldrich and The Squadronaires during the band's breaks. With the completion of the summer season, the Echoes returned to London and a meeting had been arranged with Mike Collier, who had just returned to England, after several years working in the music industry in America. He wanted to put together a team for his company, Micol Productions, and wanted the Echoes to be the rhythm section for his productions. Together with the arranger, Al Saxon, they began their association with Micol Productions. This led to the release on their first of four singles \"Sounds Like Winter\" in November 1961 on the Fontana. Other records for Micol Productions were released on Decca, Columbia and Fontana. The Echoes had already played at The Cavern Club in Liverpool, but on 3 September, they performed on the same bill as The Beatles. The year ended with a tour this time with B.

During the tour, he was injured and lost his front teeth when the band's van, driven by Gentle, had a minor accident. However, Lennon and the Scottish organiser of the tour took him out of hospital and insisted that he perform with the rest of the group. After they returned to Liverpool, Moore had already decided that he had 'had enough of Lennon'; when he did not appear for a gig one night, the rest of the band went round to his flat, and were told by his wife, Veronica (Vera) Hughes that he had gone back to his steady job at the bottle works.

Conversely, the Bootle Times reported that the group were \"sensational\".  After the performances, a fight broke out backstage after bassist Stuart Sutcliffe was told to \"cut [his] hair\" as he looked like a girl. Despite this and their group's performance, Kelly booked the group for the following weekend's dance, promoting them as \"Silver Beetles\" in the headline slot.
