He was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire.\nOn his debut against Surrey, he was unfortunate to come up against an irresistible first-innings spell of bowling from Alf Gover, who finished with 8-34 (his career best) as Worcestershire were skittled for 73. Thorp made 11 of those, being one of four Worcestershire batsman to reach double figures (no-one reached 20). In the second innings he scored only 8 (again being dismissed by Gover). He played one more match, against Lancashire, but made a pair.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thorp (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Philip Thorp (1911\u20132006), English cricketer"]}]}}
