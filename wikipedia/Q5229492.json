The duo were joined by guitarist Graeme Taylor and drummer Dave Oberl\u00e9 shortly after, thus becoming the first line-up of Gryphon. They soon signed a recording deal with the folk label Transatlantic Records and secured Nick Wright as their manager. The band's first live gig took place at the Stone Parish Church in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, promoted by the town's Friars venue. Their publicist Martin Lewis described their sound: \"Imagine Henry VIII in a rock'n'roll band \u2013 think Gryphon.\"", "In September 2007, Gryphon announced on their website that they had finally decided to produce a new album after a silence of thirty-one years.
