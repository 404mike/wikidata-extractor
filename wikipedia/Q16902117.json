He was a senior partner, later Chairman, and following retirement, President, of the architectural practice Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall (RMJM) and Partners, under the original named-partner architects.  He was knighted in 1986. Derbyshire had taken degrees at Queens' College, University of Cambridge, and at the Architectural Association, London, before realising, as principal architect with RMJM, the master-planning and designing of the University of York campus in Heslington (from 1962), said to be his chef d'oeuvre.Other works included the Castle Market in Sheffield. His Hillingdon Civic Centre in a neo-vernacular style made extensive use of brick and tile, to pay homage to traditional homely brick architecture of nearby buildings and suburban developments that were \"indigenous to the borough\".National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/77) with Andrew Derbyshire in 2003 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of York", "response": ["In 1964, work began on the campus facilities in the grounds of Heslington Hall. The marshy land was drained, the winding lake which dominates the campus was built, and the area was landscaped. The original buildings were designed by architects Sir Andrew Derbyshire and Sir Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, with input also from the Vice-Chancellor Lord James, Professor Patrick Nuttgens and the Registrar John West-Taylor. The new structures were assembled using the CLASP system of prefabricated construction, hence York's inclusion among the so-called plate glass universities. The buildings are connected by numerous covered walkways and bridges. Most of the university's arts departments occupy premises in the college buildings, while many of the science departments have their own buildings.", "The campus lake is the largest plastic-bottomed lake in Europe. The decision by Sir Andrew Derbyshire and Stirrat Johnson-Marshall to give the university a lake had two motivations: one, to give the university a distinct image and identity while also creating areas to foster community; and two, more practically to create a drainage basin for the relatively flat agricultural site as it was feared the construction of the new buildings would increase the risk of flooding. The lake has attracted a large population of wild and semi-wild waterfowl, including greylag, Canada, barnacle and snow geese, coots, moorhens and large numbers of ducks, including mallards, tufted duck, and common pochards. There is also a growing population of black swans and a few great crested grebe. Herons have also been sighted on the lake. The southern end of the lake has been established as a bird sanctuary. Fishing is permitted in season, on purchase of a licence."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2016", "response": ["*Sir Andrew Derbyshire, 92, British architect.Andrew Derbyshire (1923\u20132016)"]}]}}
