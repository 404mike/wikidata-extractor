The following game against Hyde F.C. was postponed due to bad weather. They then hosted Melbourne City, where, despite scoring an early goal through Conor Wilkinson, they lost 5\u20131, with Kisnorbo, Williams, Brown, Dugandzic and Aaron Mooy, formerly of Wanderers, all scoring for the visitors. They then went to Chorley where Wilkinson again scored the opening goal, but Chorley won the game with goals from Harry Winter and Tom Smyth. Danny Lloyd scored the only goal of Bolton XI's penultimate game of pre-season, as Bolton lost 1\u20130 to AFC Fylde, but in their final pre-season game, Bolton XI got their first win of pre-season as they beat Wrexham 1\u20130 courtesy of Chris Lester's first half goal. During pre-season ex-Bristol City defender Liam Fontaine was on trial for the club, playing in matches against AFC Fylde and Wrexham. On 6 August it was revealed that Fontaine had discontinued training with the club at the start of that week, after plans for a behind-closed-doors friendly against Udinese were shelved."]}]}}
