In his heyday he made a fortune on both sides of the Atlantic and was known as \"Britain\u2019s Painter Laureate\". His art was steadfastly conservative and he was a vitriolic critic of Modern Art \u2013 particularly of his contemporaries Picasso, Chagall and Mondrian. His father, Henry Salisbury, described himself as a \"plumber, decorator and ironmonger\" (his mother was Susan Hawes), yet his son Frank would become one of the greatest society artists of his generation.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
