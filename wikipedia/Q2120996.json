He was born in Cambuslang, Scotland.\nMcIntyre began playing soccer in Scotland with Renfrew Juniors.  In 1923, he moved to the United States, settling in Boston.  When he arrived, he joined the amateur Lusitania Recreation club.  In 1930, he signed with the professional Pawtucket Rangers of the American Soccer League.  He had an immediate impact, scoring twenty-three goals in thirty-one games in the fall 1930 season.  That was good enough to take second in the league scoring table.  In the spring of 1931, he played only eighteen games, but again scored twenty-three goals, taking the league scoring title.  That fall, he added another fifteen goals in sixteen games.In 1939, a Bob McIntyre is listed as playing in the second American Soccer League, but this may be a different McIntyre as there were three Bob McIntyre's playing during the last few seasons on the first ASL.", "link_mentions": {}}}
