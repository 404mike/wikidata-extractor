He was born and died at Coventry.\nGordon was a right-handed middle-order batsman who made a lot of runs for Warwickshire's second eleven in both the Minor Counties and the Second Eleven Championship but was never able to establish himself in the first team which, in the later part of his career, was dominated by Test players and overseas stars. He played in a few first-class matches each season from 1966 to 1971 but only in 1970 did he meet with any success, and his 65 against Surrey that season was the top score of the first innings in a match that ended with the scores level and the top score of his career. His club cricket was for Coventry and North Warwickshire Cricket Club and after leaving Warwickshire in 1971 he ran a pub at Exhall for 20 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Gordon", "response": ["Alan Gordon may refer to:", "*Alan Gordon (actor), British actor", "*Alan Gordon (author) (born 1959), mystery writer whose works are based on Shakespearean characters", "*Alan Gordon (Brookside), fictional character from the defunct soap opera Brookside", "*Alan Gordon (historian) (born 1968), Scottish-born Canadian historian", "*Alan Gordon (Scottish footballer) (1944\u20132010), Scottish footballer", "*Alan Gordon (soccer) (born 1981), American soccer player", "*Alan Gordon (songwriter) (1944\u20132008), American songwriter", "*Alan Gordon (cricketer) (1944\u20132007), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Alan Gordon (1966\u20131971) : A.
