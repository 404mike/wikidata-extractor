Jerdon and Robert Christopher Tytler. His vast collection of bird specimens is at the British Museum and during his career in India, he corresponded actively with other ornithologists in the region, notably Allan Octavian Hume. He also corresponded with ornithologists in Britain, including Henry Eeles Dresser, and sent many specimens to Dresser to distribute and trade with other ornithologists on his behalf. Brooks had always hoped that one of his children would take to natural history. His third son Allan Brooks, named after Hume, and sent to study in England and during his study in Northumberland, also trained under John Hancock, the taxidermist who was a friend of William. Allan became an ornithologist and artist of repute in Canada. In 1887, Brooks moved his family from Milton, Ontario, to a new farm at Chilliwack, British Columbia.
