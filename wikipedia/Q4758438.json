He has authored and edited numerous books, and written for The New York Times, The Guardian, The Nation, Newsweek, and Al Jazeera. Much of his writing focuses on labor, the urban environment, and the organisation of work, from the Western world of business and high-technology to conditions of offshore labour in the Global South. Making use of social theory as well as ethnography, his writing questions the human and environmental cost of economic growth. Outside his field, Ross is known as a recipient of the 1996 Ig Nobel Prize for literature for his part in the Sokal hoax.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Age", "response": ["Toward the end of the 20th century, some social and political analysts and activists were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society.Gerzon, Mark (1996).

In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic journal of postmodern cultural studies. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor, specifically to investigate whether \"a leading North American journal of cultural studies\u2014whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross\u2014[would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions.\"", "In their defense, Social Text's editors said they believed that Sokal's essay \"was the earnest attempt of a professional scientist to seek some kind of affirmation from postmodern philosophy for developments in his field\" and that \"its status as parody does not alter, substantially, our interest in the piece, itself, as a symptomatic document.\"Andrew Ross, \"A discussion of Jacques Derrida and Deconstruction\", May 24, 1996 Besides criticizing his writing style, Social Text's editors accused Sokal of behaving unethically in deceiving them."]}, {"page": "Camp (style)", "response": ["According to sociologist Andrew Ross, camp combines outmoded and contemporary forms of style, fashion, and technology. Often characterized by the reappropriation of a \"throwaway Pop aesthetic\", camp works to intermingle the categories of \"high\" and \"low\" culture. Objects may become camp objects because of their historical association with a power now in decline. As opposed to kitsch, camp reappropriates culture in an ironic fashion, whereas kitsch is indelibly sincere. Additionally, kitsch may be seen as a quality of an object, while camp, \"tends to refer to a subjective process\". Those who identify objects as \"camp\" commemorate the distance mirrored in the process through which, \"unexpected value can be located in some obscure or exorbitant object.\" The effect of camp's irony is problematic, insofar as the agents of cultural redefinition are often of upper- or middle-class standing who could, \"afford, literally, to redefine the life of consumerism and material affluence as a life of spiritual poverty\"."]}, {"page": "Higher Superstition", "response": ["Topics discussed include: cultural constructivism or social constructivism, the strong programme, the science criticism of Stanley Aronowitz and Bruno Latour, post-modernism and deconstructionism and their influence on American academia, the science criticism of Andrew Ross, feminist science criticism, environmentalist science criticism and \"apocalyptic naturism\", Jeremy Rifkin's influential \"pseudoscientific alarmism\", attacks on medical research connected with AIDS activism and animal rights advocacy, and Afrocentrism. The book also questions human activity's relationship with climate change. The authors find it unfortunate that social scientists and literary critics often consider themselves qualified to criticize the natural sciences without learning much about them in detail, and worry about what would replace Enlightenment ideals of universalism and rationalism, and objective truths about the natural world as ascertained by a scientific methodology of repeatable experiments, if these were to be discredited, as many science critics in the humanities wish to do."]}, {"page": "Mark Satin", "response": ["As the 1970s began, the New Left faded away,Todd Gitlin, The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage, Bantam Books, 1987, Chap.\u00a018.  . and many movements arose in its wake\u00a0\u2013 among them the feminist, men's liberation, spiritual, human potential, ecology, appropriate technology, intentional community, and holistic health movements.Marilyn Ferguson, The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s, Jeremy P.
