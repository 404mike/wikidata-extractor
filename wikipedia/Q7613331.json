Mickey Bell signed from Northampton Town for \u00a345,000, Gary Patterson joined from Shrewsbury Town for \u00a370,000, Terry Howard joined on a free from Leyton Orient, Miquel Desouza cost \u00a380,000 from Birmingham City and a then club record fee of \u00a3140,000 was paid for Steve McGavin, also from Birmingham. Desouza made an immediate impact, scoring twice on his debut in a 2\u20130 win at Chester City and scoring six goals in his first six appearances. Unfortunately disaster struck as he suffered an injury in training and he only returned on the last day of the season. The goals dried up and a run of eight games without a win saw the side slip out of the play-off chase. A late recovery raised hopes but a 2\u20131 defeat at home to relegation-bound Plymouth Argyle condemned the side to a sixth-place finish. That would normally have been sufficient for a play-off berth but reorganisation of the league meant there was only one automatic promotion spot and the Blues missed out by just three points.", "The summer of 1996 was one of change. Out went the likes of Simon Garner, Steve Thompson, Simon Stapleton, Tony Hemmings and Terry Howard. In came two goalkeepers, Brian Parkin and John Cheesewright and centre-back Paul McCarthy, a \u00a3100,000 capture from Brighton & Hove Albion. The season started in bizarre fashion, in more than one sense. The club had to play its opening game of the season away at Shrewsbury Town on a Sunday due to the town's flower show and the team wore a new pin-striped change shirt, which was christened with a stunning equaliser from Steve Brown to earn a 1\u20131 draw. Alan Smith always had a tough act to follow in O'Neill and after falling-out with popular players, playing a role in the changing of the quartered kit to stripes and disappointing performances he had to get results. But he didn't, and after a start of eight league games without a win, the ninth game, a 6\u20133 defeat by Peterborough United was the final straw and he was sacked. Caretaker boss Neil Smillie helped guide the team to two important wins, over Rotherham United and Notts County but a series of defeats followed which left the side languishing at the bottom of the table. It was something of a surprise when John Gregory, a coach at Aston Villa, was appointed the new boss. He slowly started to turn things around, and the team started winning regularly at home. A first round FA Cup tie with rivals Colchester United at Layer Road added some excitement and goals from Miquel Desouza and one from a suspiciously offside looking John Williams gave the Wanderers a very sweet 2\u20131 victory. Gregory realised the need to strengthen the squad and brought in midfielder Michael Simpson from Notts County for \u00a350,000, Michael Forsyth and Jason Kavanagh from Derby County, for \u00a325,000 each, striker Mark Stallard from Bradford City for \u00a3100,000 and striker Paul Read from Arsenal, also for \u00a3100,000. A first away win of the season was gained with an exciting 4\u20133 victory at Bristol Rovers just before Christmas. The team won eight of its last ten home games, remaining unbeaten at Adams Park. However, away wins proved elusive and the battle to avoid relegation went right to the wire. A pivotal result was secured at home to relegation rivals Shrewsbury Town, and it featured two loanees, goalkeeper Martin Taylor from Derby County and returning striker Keith Scott from Norwich City, making his second debut for the club. Taylor made a number of crucial saves and Scott gave the Wanderers the lead and went to win 3\u20130. A second away win came at Notts County, A long-range opportunist strike from Steve Brown was cancelled out, but a winner from Steve McGavin gave the Blues a 2\u20131 win and condemned County to the drop. It was a great escape and Wycombe had won its first battle against relegation in the Football League.", "Terry Evans took caretaker charge for almost a month until Lawrie Sanchez was appointed in February 1999. His first game in charge was a creditable 1\u20131 draw at home to Kevin Keegan's high flying Fulham Steve McGavin left the club for personal reasons before Sanchez was appointed and the new boss was told he had to make \u00a3200,000 from transfers before the end of the season. His first signing was Canadian defender Mark Rogers, who paid his own air fare to England to pursue his dream of playing professional football. By March Jason Kavanagh and Nicky Mohan had departed for Stoke City whilst Notts County paid \u00a320,000 for Mark Stallard. Striker Sean Devine was brought in on loan from Barnet but there was stunning news to follow when Keith Scott signed for local rivals Reading for \u00a3250,000. Scott departed on the same evening that Wanderers travelled to Bristol Rovers, five points adrift at the bottom of the table and eight points from safety. A brave header from Jason Cousins gave the visitors the lead, one which saw Cousins miss the rest of the season and a Sean Devine shot from the edge of the area in the second half brought an unlikely victory. It proved to be a catalyst as the side lost just 2 of its last 11 league games. The highlight was a 2\u20131 win away at Manchester City, where first half goals from Baird and Devine sealed a magnificent double against the fallen giants. Devine was signed permanently for a club record \u00a3200,000. The penultimate game of the season was at home to promotion chasing Wigan Athletic, who went a goal up in the first half but soon pegged back by some sharper shooting from Devine. Early in the second half Paul Emblen deflected in the winning goal to set up a tense final day away at Lincoln City. The club paid for 30-odd supporters coaches and 2,643 Wanderers made the journey to Sincil Bank. A tense game saw Baird miss a golden early chance and when Michael Forsyth hit the post it looked like it really was mission impossible. However, with just seven minutes of the season remaining Devine crossed for Emblen a header over Vaughan and into the top corner of the net. It was an incredible finale to amazing escape from a relegation that seemed a certainty for much of the season. It brought the new manager much praise, but he was to go on to even greater things."]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Steve McGavin "]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Steve McGavin"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| \u2013 || ST || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Steve McGavin", "| 1 October 1999 || CF ||  || Steve McGavin || Colchester United || Free ||"]}, {"page": "McGavin, Steve", "response": ["#redirectSteve McGavin"]}, {"page": "1992 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["The attendance for the match was 32,254 at Wembley, with an estimated 23,000 Colchester United fans in attendance.
