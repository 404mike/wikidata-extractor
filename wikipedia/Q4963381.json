With the switch to 1330\u00a0AM, KWKW expanded its focus on regional Mexican music (including mariachi and banda), calling itself \"La Mexicana\". It also brought with it its sports coverage, which included Spanish-language broadcasts of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Raiders. Dodgers broadcasts were headed up by play-by-play announcer Jaime Jarr\u00edn, a position he has held continuously since the 1959 season; Jarr\u00edn began working at KWKW in 1955 as a news reporter. The station was further recognized by the National Association of Broadcasters as 1992's Spanish-language station of the year during their annual Marconi Radio Awards. That same year, Jim Kalmenson of Lotus attributed the success of KWKW to an audience that preferred tradition over change and needed a source of community information."]}]}}
