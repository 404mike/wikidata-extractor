He was the brother of the architects Charles Underwood (circa 1791\u20131883) and George Allen Underwood (dates unknown).Underwood trained in London as a pupil of Henry Hake Seward and then joined the office of Sir Robert Smirke. In 1830 he moved to Oxford where much of his work involved designing churches or schools. He built Saint Paul's parish church, Walton Street, and the library of the Oxford Botanic Garden in the Greek Revival style but is best known for his Gothic Revival architecture. His church at Littlemore for Newman became a model for other churches.Underwood designed an extension to Oxford Prison. In 1852 he committed suicide at the White Hart Hotel, Bath, Somerset so J. C. Buckler completed the extension in his stead.", "link_mentions": {}}}
