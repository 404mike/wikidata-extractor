He also played semi-professional football for Accrington Stanley. He is known through the cricketing world as \"Bumble\" because of the ostensible similarity between his facial profile and those of the Bumblies, characters from Michael Bentine's children's television programmes.A left-handed batsman and left-arm spin bowler, he played nine Tests, with a highest score of 214 not out, and eight One Day International matches. In first-class cricket he was a successful all-rounder, scoring a career aggregate of more than 19,000 runs and taking 237 wickets. He captained his county from 1973 to 1977. Following his retirement as a player, he became a first-class umpire, and subsequently Lancashire and England cricket coach, resigning the latter post following the 1999 Cricket World Cup. He then became a renowned cricket commentator for Test Match Special, and later Sky Sports. He is also an author, journalist and columnist. In December 2021, Lloyd announced his retirement from commentating.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Accrington", "response": ["*David Lloyd, cricketer, now a pundit for Sky Sports"]}, {"page": "March 18", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 David Lloyd, English cricketer, journalist, and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "David Gower", "response": ["Gower made his debut for Leicestershire on 30 July 1975, during that season's County Championship, against Lancashire at Stanley Park, Blackpool.

Gower, batting at number seven, scored 32 before he was dismissed by Ken Shuttleworth, Leicestershire making 321 and taking a first-innings lead.
