Because of his multiple, simultaneous roles, which carried judicial, political, cultural and commercial power and influence, Sholl is regarded as a significant figure in the history of North-West Australia, at an early stage of its settlement by Europeans.\nBetween 1865 and 1881, Sholl was the most senior government official and only judicial officer in North West Australia between the Murchison River and Timor Sea \u2013 a jurisdiction known at the time as the North District. His headquarters at Roebourne was extremely isolated \u2013 messages took weeks to travel between Sholl and his immediate superior, Frederick Barlee, Colonial Secretary of Western Australia. Consequently,  Sholl wielded considerable, de facto executive power; an obituary in The West Australian described him as having been \"virtually a Lieutenant Governor\" of the North District.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Port Hedland, Western Australia", "response": ["In 1866, the Government Resident at Roebourne, Robert John Sholl, directed Charles Wedge to re-examine Port Hedland as an alternative port, because the distance from Tien Tsin Harbour (later known as Cossack) was discouraging settlement in areas such as the De Grey River.

He eventually decided to locate the town at his camp, and on 17 August 1866, after surveyor Charles Wedge drew a draft plan consisting of 106 lots, Roebourne became the first gazetted town in the North West. It became the region's administrative centre and various government buildings, shops, services and hotels set up business. Sholl himself served as Justice of the Peace, district registrar and magistrate, and he was concerned with the plight of the local indigenous people and made submissions to the Government to ensure they had basic rights.Wendy Birman, 'Sholl, Robert John (1819-1886)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6, Melbourne University Press, 1976, pp 121-122."]}, {"page": "Licensed lay minister", "response": ["* Robert John Sholl, settler of Western Australia"]}, {"page": "Charles Wedge", "response": ["Following the failure of the Denison Plains scheme, Wedge was employed at Roebourne as a Western Australian government surveyor.

The natural harbour of Port Hedland itself was already considered unsuitable, due to the thick mangroves. Following heavy, unseasonal rain and swollen tidal creeks, Wedge was unable to reach the harbour itself or find another site. Wedge reported: \"Independently of the Port being difficult of access from the land sides, the want of a natural supply of water must always be a serious impediment to its being made available as a shipping port.\" He also felt that the deep sand and lack of wood for building made the area unsuitable."]}, {"page": "North West Australia", "response": ["thumb|left|150px|A map showing the location of the Murchison River.
