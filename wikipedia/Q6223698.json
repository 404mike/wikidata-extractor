As the owner of a major metalworking concern known as the Duffryn Steel and Tinplate Works, he had the resources to fund a number of philanthropic and charitable endeavours for which he was recognised in the 1921 Birthday Honours by being created, at the unusually young age of 32, a Baronet of Treforis in the County of Glamorgan.Edwards married Kathleen Ermyntrude Corfield, daughter of John Corfield, managing director of Dillwyn & Co, on 18 January 1911. They had a son and a daughter. In the years following his death, Hendrefoilan House became part of the campus of Swansea University and was the site, until 2006, of the South Wales Miners' Library.", "link_mentions": {}}}
