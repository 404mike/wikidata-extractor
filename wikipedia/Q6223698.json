As the owner of a major metalworking concern known as the Duffryn Steel and Tinplate Works, he had the resources to fund a number of philanthropic and charitable endeavours for which he was recognised in the 1921 Birthday Honours by being created, at the unusually young age of 32, a Baronet of Treforis in the County of Glamorgan.Edwards married Kathleen Ermyntrude Corfield, daughter of John Corfield, managing director of Dillwyn & Co, on 18 January 1911. They had a son and a daughter. In the years following his death, Hendrefoilan House became part of the campus of Swansea University and was the site, until 2006, of the South Wales Miners' Library.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Edwards (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John Bryn Edwards (1889\u20131922), Welsh ironmaster and philanthropist"]}, {"page": "1922 in Wales", "response": ["*22 August \u2013 John Bryn Edwards, ironmaster, 33"]}, {"page": "1889 in Wales", "response": ["*12 January \u2013 John Bryn Edwards, ironmaster and philanthropist (died 1922)"]}, {"page": "Sir John Bryn Edwards, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#Redirect John Bryn Edwards"]}, {"page": "1921 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*John Bryn Edwards, for social and philanthropic work in East Glamorgan"]}]}}
