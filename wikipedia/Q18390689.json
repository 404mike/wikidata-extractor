Their parents have split up, so the two sisters are constantly swapping living with 'Mum' Sharon, (Hannah Jane Fox) and 'Dad' Tony (James Bachman). Millie loves the upsides of her new family set-up; two Christmas celebrations, two birthdays, and two bedrooms. However, the downsides are more tricky to come to terms with, as her parents start new relationships. The parents' new partners have children, too - and they all want to move in. Sharon has a new partner called Mike (Jeremy Edwards), who has a son called Craig (Theo Stevenson), who is a nightmare. Tony meets a new partner called Amber (Jaye Jacobs), who has 2 children called Fran (Mya-Lecia Naylor) and Jake (Marley Lockhart).", "| Millie Innes"]}, {"page": "British Academy Children's Awards 2017", "response": ["| Millie Innes || Millie McDonald || Millie Inbetween || rowspan=\"2\"|CBBC"]}]}}
