In his 26 years at the county Sandham formed a formidable opening partnership with Jack Hobbs, and the two put on a hundred for the first wicket on 66 occasions, the highest of these the 428 they accumulated against Oxford University in 1926. He passed 2,000 runs in eight seasons, and during the middle part of his career between 1924 and 1931 averaged above 50 in all but two years. He scored an unbeaten 292 against Northants, being denied his triple century only by Percy Fender's declaration, and still holds three record Surrey partnerships, including the 173 he put on with Andy Ducat for the 10th wicket at Leyton after suffering a bout of food poisoning."]}, {"page": "Andrew Ducat", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andy Ducat"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Andy Ducat \u00b7"]}]}}
