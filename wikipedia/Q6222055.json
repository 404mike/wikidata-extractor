May 1802), was an English-born ship's officer who had many adventures in his short career. His best remembered adventure concerned the mutiny on Lady Shore in August 1797, a ship that had been sailing with a cargo of soldiers and female convicts to Sydney, Australia. In 1798 his father, the Reverend John Black (1753\u20131813), a prolific writer of prose and poetry, published his son's letters which gave an account of the mutiny on board the ship, when his son had been put into a small boat and left to find his way to safety with several other members of the crew. The book was dedicated as a \"small testimony of gratitude to the Portuguese nation\" for the \"unequalled hospitality\" extended to his son and his fellows in the Portuguese colonies that are now part of Brazil.\nJohn Black was also privateer (state-sanctioned pirate) for part of his naval career. He was engaged twice on privateers, once as the ship\u2019s captain. That is, during the time of the English-Spanish war of 1795\u20131801, he was twice engaged on private warships authorized by the English government to attack and rob the enemy\u2019s shipping. During both engagements he was involved in the successful capture of a Spanish vessel.\nIn 1798 the 19-year-old sailed into Sydney Harbour, where, after meeting the convict girl Mary Hyde (1779\u20131864), he made Sydney his base of operations. In between his whaling operations, voyages of exploration, and capturing Spanish vessels, he and Mary had two children. In 1802, in what became his final voyage, the then 23-year-old ship's captain sailed from Sydney to India: to Mumbai (then Bombay) and then onto Kolkata (then Calcutta) before being lost at sea as he sailed for home.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1778", "response": ["** John Black, Australian sailor (d. 1802)"]}, {"page": "History of Victoria", "response": ["In 1801 Harbinger, under John Black, was the second vessel to sail through Bass Strait en route to Port Jackson.

The boundary between Victoria and Tasmania was later set along the latitude of 39\u00b012\u2032 S, which was then thought to be completely south of Boundary Islet and not to traverse any land in Bass Strait. This would have made the islet completely within the jurisdiction of Victoria. However, when Boundary Islet's correct latitude was later determined it was found to straddle the border. It is for this reason that what was once known as North East Islet (being situated in the north-east of the Hogan Group) came to be known as Boundary Islet."]}, {"page": "John Black", "response": ["John Black may refer to:", "*John Black (baseball) (1890\u20131962), Major League Baseball first baseman", "*John Black (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131993), Scottish footballer", "*John Black (footballer, born 1914), Scottish footballer", "*John Black (footballer, born 1957), Scottish footballer", "*John Black (rugby union) (born 1951), New Zealand rugby union player", "*John Black (sport shooter) (1882\u20131924), Canadian Olympic sport shooter", "*John Black (golfer) (1879\u20131963), Scottish golfer", "*John Black (U.S. senator) (died 1854), Mississippi judge and politician", "*John Black (Lower Canada politician) (c. 1764\u2013after 1819), shipbuilder and politician in Lower Canada", "*John Black (New Brunswick politician) (1856\u20131936), lawyer and politician in New Brunswick, Canada", "*John Black (merchant) (c. 1765\u20131823), merchant and politician in New Brunswick", "*John Black (Georgia politician) (1933\u20132017), member of the Georgia State Senate", "*John Black (Wisconsin politician) (1830\u20131899), Milwaukee mayor, 1878\u20131880", "*John Black (Australian politician) (born 1952), Australian Senator", "*John Black (Days of Our Lives), a fictional character on the NBC soap opera Days of our Lives", "*John Black, character of Age of Empires III Act II", "*John Black, character in Babes in Arms", "*John Black (martyr) Scottish Roman Catholic martyred on the same night David Rizzio was murdered.", "*John Black (privateer) (1778\u20131802), captain, privateer and survivor of the mutiny on the Lady Shore", "*John Black (journalist) (1783\u20131855), editor of the Morning Chronicle, 1817\u20131843", "*John Black (Canadian judge) (1817\u20131879), Scottish-born, judge in Canada and politician in Australia", "*Sir John Black (businessman) (1895\u20131965), British motor industry executive", "*John Black (cryptographer), computer science professor", "*John Black (director) (born 1940), retired British TV director", "*John Black (clergyman) (1818\u20131882), Presbyterian clergyman who emigrated from Scotland to the Red River Colony", "*John Black (composer) (c. 1520\u20131587), Scottish singer and composer", "*John Black (music manager) (born 1967), British music manager", "*The Soul of John Black, an American soul group"]}, {"page": "1801 in Australia", "response": ["* January \u2013 Brig Harbinger, under John Black, is the second vessel to sail through Bass Strait en route to Port Jackson."]}, {"page": "Norfolk (1801 brig)", "response": ["In 1801 Harbinger, under the command of Captain John Black, was the second vessel to sail through Bass Strait en route to Port Jackson, Australia.
