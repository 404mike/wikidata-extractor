Warner was able to recover to appear in all five FA Cup matches, when Villa reached the final where they again met local rivals West Bromwich Albion. In the final, played at Kennington Oval on 19 March 1892, Warner and his colleagues in the Villa defence were no match for Billy Bassett and the Albion forwards who won the match comfortably 3\u20130, with goals from Jasper Geddes, Sammy Nicholls and Jack Reynolds."]}]}}
