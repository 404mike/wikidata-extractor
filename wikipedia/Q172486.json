In the former, he drove a private Cooper-Climax and retired just before half-distance, while in the latter he was entered in a private BRM but was forced to give his car to American Bob Bondurant before the race. He also participated in some non-Championship Formula One races.\nAfter racing, Wilson worked as a motor dealer before dying in a motor accident at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1966 Belgian Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Vic Wilson", "|  Vic Wilson"]}, {"page": "Vic Wilson", "response": ["Vic Wilson may refer to:", "* Vic Wilson (cricketer) (1921\u20132008), English cricketer", "* Vic Wilson (racing driver) (1931\u20132001), British racing driver"]}, {"page": "BRM P261", "response": ["Back in Europe, only Brabham, Ferrari and Cooper had managed to secure a true 3-litre motor for their Formula One vehicles.

BRM did have the ambitious H16 engine in development, but for the first few races the team were forced to use the, by now two-year-old, P261. Despite this hindrance Jackie Stewart took first place at the season opening Monaco Grand Prix. However, when Jack Brabham's Brabham BT19 was on song, Hill and Stewart's P261s were outclassed, and were replaced by the H16-engined P83 for the season's final three races. Team Chamaco Collect entered American Bob Bondurant in five races, and British-born South African Vic Wilson in one.  Wilson was the cousin of team boss Bernard White, who subsequently renamed his team to the less-exotic Bernard White Racing and entered a privateer P261 for Innes Ireland in the final two races of 1966, but he failed to finish on either occasion.", "| Vic Wilson", "| Vic Wilson"]}, {"page": "Vic Wilson (auto racing)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Wilson (racing driver)"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["*Vic Wilson (cricketer) (1921\u20132008), English cricketer", "*Vic Wilson (racing driver) (1931\u20132001), British racing driver"]}, {"page": "1977 Australian Touring Car Championship", "response": ["| Vic Wilson", "| Vic Wilson"]}, {"page": "Bernard White Racing", "response": ["In 1965 Bernard White entered his ex Maranello Concessionaires Ferrari 250LM (5907) at Mallory Park and Angola (Vic Wilson) and in 1966 at the Daytone Continental driven by Vic Wilson and Denny Hulme and at Brands Hatch and Zeltweg (David Hobbs) and then at Kyalami driven by Mike Hailwood and Bob Anderson.", "|align=left|  Vic Wilson", "|align=left|  Vic Wilson"]}, {"page": "Vic Wilson (motor racing driver)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Wilson (racing driver)"]}, {"page": "1965 RAC Tourist Trophy", "response": ["|  Vic Wilson", "| Vic Wilson"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2001", "response": ["*Vic Wilson, 69, British racing driver."]}]}}
