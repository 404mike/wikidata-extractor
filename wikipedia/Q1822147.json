He found first-team opportunities limited in the 2009\u201310 campaign due to injury and the form of other players. The following season he re-established himself in the starting eleven, finishing as the club's top scorer with a total of 13 goals in 45 appearances.

Days after the game Derby manager Paul Jewell said that a member of the Football Association had contacted him and told him that the second goal should have stood. The Attwell controversy overshadowed Derby's run of only one defeat in 11 and their retention of the Brian Clough Trophy. It also stretched Derby's unbeaten streak against Forest to five, having lost just once to their rivals in the last 11 meetings. Following the Forest game however, Derby's form began to stutter \u2013 despite two wins over League One clubs Brighton & Hove Albion (4\u20131) and Leeds United (2\u20131) in the League Cup, taking Derby to their first quarter-final in the competition since 1989, Derby won just one of their next four league games, a 3\u20130 win over Sheffield Wednesday that gave them their biggest league win since a 5\u20131 win over Colchester United in May 2007.

The match proved to be controversial, with Emanuel Villa scoring at both ends to make the score 1\u20131. Lewis McGugan was given a straight red card, then a 93rd-minute penalty for Derby was saved by former Ram Lee Camp, with manager Colin Calderwood commenting after that the save would go down in the folklore. Veteran striker Andrew Cole then had his contract cancelled by \"mutual consent\" after the ex-Manchester United forward had fallen out with the club, as he was often being left on the bench. Forest followed up the Derby draw with another 1\u20131 draw at home to promotion-chasing Birmingham City and then a 2\u20132 draw away to Bristol City; the latter match saw Camp save another injury-time penalty and a point, seeing Forest into a four-game unbeaten run. However, they then lost 2\u20131 at home to Norwich City to return to the bottom of the table. A further 0\u20130 away draw at relegation rivals Doncaster Rovers saw mass tabloid speculation that manager Colin Calderwood was set to be replaced by Billy Davies. In the next game, at home to Barnsley, Forest won by a 36th-minute header from Joe Garner, moving off the foot of the table to 23rd. Forest drew 2\u20132 at Coventry City, twice coming from behind to claim a point, but their poor home form continued with a 1\u20130 home loss to Sheffield United and a 0\u20130 draw against relegation rivals Blackpool. Forest then recorded an important victory away at Southampton, with defender Wes Morgan scoring his first goal of the season and Joe Garner chipping the goalkeeper from 35 yards. This took Forest to just one point off safety, with their next game at home to bottom-of-the-table Doncaster Rovers, but Forest were 4\u20130 down within an hour and down to ten men for much of the second half after Julian Bennett came off injured after Forest had used all their substitutions, with a cruciate-ligament injury ruling the left-back out for the rest of the season. Forest replied with two late goals, but immediately after the game the Forest board terminated manager Colin Calderwood's contract after two and a half years in charge of the club; assistant manager David Kerslake was also dismissed. Reserve-team manager John Pemberton took caretaker charge at Norwich City, which Forest won 3\u20132 to rise out of the relegation zone for the first time in three months; this game saw the end of Lee Camp's loan spell. On 1 January, Nottingham Forest appointed Billy Davies as their new manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal with David Kelly named as his assistant manager. Davies watched the next match, against nouveau-riche Premier League side Manchester City in the FA Cup third round, which saw Forest won 3\u20130 with goals from strikers Nathan Tyson, Robert Earnshaw and Joe Garner. Davies' first game in charge saw Forest go to bottom of the table Charlton Athletic and beat the strugglers 2\u20130, with Tyson and Earnshaw netting for the Reds. Their third victory in a row pushed Forest up to 21st and moved them closer to teams directly above them. A 2\u20130 home win Plymouth Argyle moved them into 20th before a big rival match in the FA Cup against Derby County at Pride Park, which ended 1\u20131. There will be a replay on 4 February at the City Ground. This was followed up by a 2\u20131 home win against Sheffield Wednesday, in which Forest came from behind to win. The result put them 17th, four points clear of the relegation zone. February saw just one win for Forest at the end of the month against promotion chasing Reading. Forest lost their opening game of February to local rivals Derby in the FA Cup. Forest then drew 1\u20131 with QPR before going on a three-game losing streak to Birmingham City, Ipswich Town and Derby this time in the league. After the bitter disappointment of picking up just one victory in February, Forest were looking to get off to the best possible start, and they did against Preston in a 2\u20131 victory with a brace from Rob Earnshaw sending Forest three places up the table into 18th and looking a lot less likely to face the drop after another good result this time a 1\u20131 draw to Swansea City. However another three game losing streak to Watford, a 5\u20130 loss to Burnley and then a 1\u20130 defeat to Wolves thanks to a Michael Kightly goal saw Forest take another dramatic downturn and they slipped in the league table to the regulation place of 22nd. Forest knew that with just six games left to stay in the Championship they needed something special. After a 1\u20131 draw against Barnsley following a desperate equaliser from Rob Earnshaw, Forest still sat in the drop zone. Up next were Bristol City, when city went ahead through Ivan Sproule things looked bleak again at the City Ground. Rob Earnshaw again showed his fantastic ability to score vital goals after grabbing an equaliser but with twelve minutes to go Forest went 2\u20131 down thanks to Dele Adebola. Forest turned things round in a fantastic comeback, Joe Garner making it 2\u20132 and then in stoppage time on loan Dexter Blackstock grabbed the late winner to give Forest a vital three points and climb themselves out of the drop zone. A midweek match against Sheffield United followed the fantastic win against City but it was a dull affair. After Kelvin Wilson was sent off early on, Forest's best chance fell to Joe Garner who fired over the crossbar and the Red's had to settle for a 0\u20130 draw that put them back into the drop zone on goal difference with Barnsley. Coventry City was the next opponents Forest had to face. Forest seemed more likely too pick up a result as the match was at the City Ground following the hysterics last week against Bristol City. And the only goal from James Perch after 46 minutes gave Forest a well-deserved win sending them up to 20th and out the drop zone, however they could not be complacent yet as both Norwich City and Barnsley, the two teams behind them had games in hand. Following the draw at Coventry, Forest saw that both Barnsley and Norwich failed to pick up a result that threatened Forest's safety. The early kick off saw on 25 April saw Forest hold Blackpool to a 1\u20131 draw at Bloomfield Road. Barnsley played Wolves and looked to have won what was a vital game however a late equaliser for Wolves saw Forest with a chance to stay up if Norwich were to lose to Reading. And they did, two goals from Shane Long meant Forest had escaped the drop.

However, their first home league game of the season ended in a 1\u20130 defeat to West Bromwich Albion, due to an own goal by Wes Morgan and Robert Earnshaw missed a penalty for Forest. Forest then suffered their second home defeat of the week, a 4\u20132 loss against Watford. The following Saturday saw Forest pick up a point in a 1\u20131 draw away to Q.P.R, with a goal from David McGoldrick in the second half. The next fixture was a midweek League Cup tie against Middlesbrough at the City Ground.

However Derby were not done yet when a Wes Morgan own goal and Jake Livermore goal had Derby back into the game. Forest held onto the win but it was after the game that made the headlines with Nathan Tyson celebrating the win by parading a corner flag, emblazoned with the Forest emblem, across the away fans. Tyson, and Forest as a whole, argued that the gesture was celebratory and the move across the away fans was so Tyson could salute the home fans above and at the other end of the away end. The Derby contingent disagreed, believing that the gesture was inflammatory. Derby players and staff clashed with Forest players and staff. The FA charged Forest and Derby with \"failing to control their players\", while Tyson was charged with improper conduct. Tyson pleaded guilty to his charge, as did Derby. Forest pleaded not guilty. The FA fined Forest \u00a325,000 and Derby \u00a320,000, with \u00a310,000 suspended for both.

However Forest were then up against high-flying Blackpool and suffered a 1\u20130 defeat before going out of the League Cup by the same scoreline to Blackburn Rovers. But a 1\u20130 win over struggling Plymouth Argyle gave Forest a new lease of life and they made it consecutive wins after a 2\u20130 win over Scunthorpe United. In October, Forest moved up to 10th place, their highest position in the Football League since the 2003/04 season, after a 2\u20131 victory over Darren Ferguson's, Peterborough United. Forest then defeated Newcastle United, who were then in second place in the table, at home to gain their fourth consecutive win and consign the Toon to only their second defeat of the season. An injury-time winner from Guy Moussi saw Forest to their fifth-consecutive win, against Barnsley at home. However, after this Moussi was sent off for a second bookable offence, for celebrating with the Forest fans in the Trent End. Forest ended the month with a 1\u20131 draw away at Crystal Palace after coming from behind. November started where October left off with two 1\u20131 draws against Cardiff City and Bristol City. Lewis McGugan rescued a point with an injury-time equaliser against Cardiff, with Wes Morgan scoring a late goal against Bristol City, who pulled level later in the game. The next match saw Forest play Middlesbrough away. An early goal from the home team saw Forest on the back foot but a free kick in second half from Robert Earnshaw saw Forest to their fourth-successive 1\u20131 draw. The week after Forest introduced a 'mixed area' of fans, where fans of both Forest and Doncaster could sit together. After selling out this allocation, they went on to record their biggest win of the season, at that stage, with a 4\u20131 victory. This also saw Nicky Shorey make his debut for the Reds. Forest kick started December with an impressive 5\u20131 victory over East Midlands neighbours Leicester City, including a Robert Earnshaw hat-trick. Forest then claimed a draw at Sheffield United before going to win at Swansea City and beat Preston at home, Billy Davies' and Paul McKenna's former club who scored the first goal. The Christmas period saw Forest get a draw away at Watford and a win at home against Coventry City. January began with a very important win over promotion rivals West Bromwich Albion. Blackstock, Majewski and Cohen all got on the scoresheet as the Reds won 3\u20131 to help them leap frog West Brom into second place. The month continued to be good as Forest beat Reading 2\u20131 and thumped QPR 5\u20130 at home to help them stay in second place.  However the month ended in disaster as Forest lost away for the first time in the season to local rivals Derby County 1\u20130. This saw their 19-game unbeaten run come to an end. This, coupled with the FA Cup exit, saw mixed emotions through the month. Forest bounced back in February with a win at home to Sheffield Wednesday, thanks to a Dexter Blackstock brace, which saw Forest's impressive home record continue. However, the defeat to Derby away had had its effects. Two away defeats on the bounce to Coventry City and Doncaster Rovers saw the Reds slip down to third, despite being unbeaten away for the earlier parts of the season. Home wins against Sheffield United and Middlesbrough saw Forest back up to 3rd but their away form took another blow as they lost to Leicester City 3\u20130 away.  March began with an injury time winner from Luke Chambers against Swansea City at home saw Forest mount a push to keep the pressure on second placed WBA but away defeats against Preston North End and Barnsley dented these hopes. A 4th consecutive 1\u20130 win at home, against Peterborough United, and a 2\u20130 win against Crystal Palace saw Forest equal Brian Clough's record of twelve consecutive home wins but it was not enough though as West Bromwich Albion got further away in the promotion push. A 7th consecutive away defeat, against table topping Newcastle United, saw most fans condemn themselves to the playoffs and West Brom pulled away even further. April saw Forest gained their first away point in three months against Bristol City thanks to a finish from outside the box from Guy Moussi to draw 1\u20131. Forest's draw at home to Cardiff 2 days later meant Newcastle were confirmed of promotion. Forest then got an impressive win against Ipswich at home which saw them qualify for the playoffs, but also meant West Brom gained the final automatic promotion place. The following week Forest played Blackpool away, the last team to beat them at home back in September. With Forest already qualified for the playoffs, the starting 11 saw many fringe players in, which saw Forest go on to lose 3\u20131 with Joe Garner getting the consolation, his first of the season. Forest's last home game of the season was against already relegated Plymouth Argyle, where Forest won 3\u20130.
