He with other British officers inspired the poorly equipped Turkish soldiers to repel Russian attacks by General Murav\u2019ev on the besieged town for three months causing 6,000 Russian casualties. They were forced to surrender due to starvation, disease and shortage of ammunition. However, they surrendered on their own terms, with the officers being allowed to retain their swords. Williams was imprisoned at Ryazan but he was treated very well and released at the end of the Crimean War in 1856. Before returning home he was introduced to Tsar Alexander II.\nMany other honours were bestowed upon Williams, and in 1865\u20137, he was appointed the first Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, where was born.", "link_mentions": {}}}
