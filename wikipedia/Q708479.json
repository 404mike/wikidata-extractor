Askey's humour owed much to the playfulness of the characters he portrayed, his improvisation, and his use of catchphrases, which included \"Hello playmates!\", \"I thank you\" (pronounced \"Ay-Thang-Yaw\"), and \"Before your very eyes\". He was short (5' 2\", 1.58 m), with a breezy, smiling personality, and wore distinctive horn-rimmed glasses.", "link_mentions": {}}}
