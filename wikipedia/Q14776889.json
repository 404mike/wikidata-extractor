He first came to prominence during the 1940s and 1950s in several operas by composer Benjamin Britten, often performing at Covent Garden and the Aldeburgh and Glyndebourne festivals. He later began a television acting career during the 1970s appearing mostly in small roles in TV dramas. He branched out into films during the 1980s, notably appearing in Clint Eastwood's 1990 film White Hunter, Black Heart. He is particularly remembered for his portrayal of J. R.

Four performances featuring the same principals as the premiere were given, on 14 and 15 November 1958, with Britten conducting the first. All four performances sold out on the first day of booking, even, as Britten told a friend, \"before any advertisement & with 2000 circulars yet to be sent!!\" On 24 and 25 April 1959 the  Finchley Children's Music Group, which was formed in 1958 specially to perform Noye's Fludde, gave what was billed as \"the  first amateur London performance\" of the work,  at All Saint's Church, Finchley; the cast included the operatic bass Norman Lumsden as Noah.
