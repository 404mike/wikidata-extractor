Heraud took Emerson to be a disciple of Carlyle, and was contradicted in The Present. A few years later he was explaining that Swedenborg was to be taken only as an example and inspiration, since the transcendentalist approach was at odds with an established church. It was through the pages of the Monthly Magazine that two notable Swedenborgians, James John Garth Wilkinson and Henry James Sr., came to know each other."]}, {"page": "Daniel Dunglas Home", "response": ["Some early guests at Home's sittings included the scientist Sir David Brewster (who remained unconvinced), the novelists Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton and Thomas Adolphus Trollope, and the Swedenborgian James John Garth Wilkinson.Doyle \"The History of Spiritualism\" volume 1, 1926 pp193-195 As well as Brewster, fellow scientists Michael Faraday and Thomas Huxley were prominent contemporary critics of Home's claims. It was the poet Robert Browning however, who proved to be one of Home's most adamant critics. After attending a s\u00e9ance of Home's, Browning wrote in a letter to The Times that: 'the whole display of hands, spirit utterances etc., was a cheat and imposture'. Browning gave his unflattering impression of Home in the poem, \"Sludge the Medium\" (1864). His wife, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, was convinced that the phenomena she witnessed were genuine and their discussions about Home were a constant source of disagreement.Lamont 2005 p50 Frank Podmore writes of a Mr Merrifield's first-hand account of experiencing Home's fraudulence during a s\u00e9ance."]}, {"page": "Wilkinson (surname)", "response": ["* James John Garth Wilkinson, English Swedenborgian writer"]}, {"page": "J.J.
