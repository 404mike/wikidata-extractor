From the time of his birth, he was second in the line of succession to the British throne, but did not become king as he died before his father and grandmother.\nAlbert Victor was known to his family, and many later biographers, as \"Eddy\". When young, he travelled the world extensively as a naval cadet, and as an adult he joined the British Army, but did not undertake any active military duties. After two unsuccessful courtships, he became engaged to be married to Princess Victoria Mary of Teck in late 1891. A few weeks later, he died during an influenza pandemic. Mary later married his younger brother, who became King George V in 1910.\nAlbert Victor's intellect, sexuality, and mental health have been the subject of speculation. Rumours in his time linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel; however, there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there, or was indeed homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporaneous documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 8", "response": ["*1864 \u2013 Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (d. 1892)"]}, {"page": "January 14", "response": ["*1892 \u2013 Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (b. 1864; influenza)Official statement of Sir Dighton Probyn released to the press and quoted in many newspapers, e.g. \"The Death of the Duke of Clarence: Description of His Last Hours\".

However, Victoria still persisted and tried to convince Alix of the benefits of the match. Victoria wrote to Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, Alix's older sister, that Alix \"should be made to reflect seriously on the folly of throwing away the chance of a very good husband, kind, affectionate and steady, and of entering a united happy family and a very good position which is second to none in the world!\"RA VIC/ADDU/173/150, QV to V of Battenberg, 31 March 1889 Alix's older sister Ella opposed the match because \"he [Eddy] does not look over strong and is too stupid.\"M.
