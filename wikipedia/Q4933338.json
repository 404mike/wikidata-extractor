Queens finished a creditable third, but their biggest achievement that season was in the Scottish Qualifying Cup. Then considerably more prestigious than now, Queens brought the cup to the South West for the first time in its 25-year history. In the final replay, a surging run through the opposition half and shot from McDermid opened the scoring. Next McDermid's 'dummy' let Bert Lister in to hit the second. McDermid's left foot finish sealed the 3-0 win and Queens were crowned cup winners. The train bringing the players and the trophy back to Dumfries were met by crowds of jubilant well wishers on the platforms and surrounding streets and approaches.
