The picturesque is subordinated in his paintings of Eyam so as to interpret his subject as a living community within a worked landscape. His \"Road above Eyam\" (1936), now in the Laing Art Gallery, is travelled by people going about their daily business, for example, and his \"Burning Limestone\" in Newport Museum and Art Gallery acknowledges the two centuries and more of industrialisation by which the local inhabitants earned their living among harsh conditions."]}, {"page": "Millbrook, Southampton", "response": ["On 16 May 1925, Lucy Hodder and the English artist Harry Epworth Allen were married at Holy Trinity Church.Batsford, J.

John Luke's painting technique was painstakingly slow, his manner precise.  'I'm afraid I'm very much a one job man,' he once wrote to John Hewitt, continuing: 'my strength lies in making the most of one job at a time, in sustained thought and effort, to bring it to the highest level of organisation and completeness I desire: the other way I lead to disintegrate in looseness and frustration with its inevitable weakness.'  The precision characteristic of his work was manifested, too, in his appearance and personal manner.  Dark haired, in stature he was erect and spare of build.  Always tidy, his clothes brushed, his hair short, he was, in Hewitt's words, 'not at all close to the romantic stereotype of the artist'."]}, {"page": "HE Allen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Epworth Allen"]}]}}
