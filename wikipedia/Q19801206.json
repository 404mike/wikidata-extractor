At the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells theatres, he danced major roles in productions of both classical and contemporary ballets, including the Bluebird in The Sleeping Beauty, Franz in Copp\u00e9lia, Albrecht in Giselle, and Harlequin in Le Carnaval as well as in new works by Frederick Ashton and Ninette de Valois. Of the numerous roles he created during his five years with this company, the two most memorable are the Red Knight in Checkmate by de Valois and the Blue Boy in Les Patineurs (The Skaters) by Ashton. Both were created in 1937; both are principal male roles. The Red Knight is engaged in a dramatic, grim struggle of love and death with the Black Queen; the Blue Boy is a perky, lighthearted show-off performing dazzling tricks on a frozen pond. Turner excelled in each role. \"It is arguable that he has never been surpassed, possibly never even equaled, in either of these very different creations. Certainly, at the time, no one else in the company could have tackled either one of them, and it was years before he was replaced in either role.\"Simpson, \"Legend: Harold Turner\" (2000).", "Turner was married twice: first to Mary Honer (1914-1965), a virtuoso dancer with the Vic-Wells Ballet who had originated the  role of one of the Blue Girls in Les Patineurs, then to Gerd Larsen (1921-2001), a dancer, ballet mistress, and principal mime with the Royal Ballet. Turner and Larsen were married from 1944 until his death in 1962.
