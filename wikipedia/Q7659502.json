An early dramatic role, in 1898, was Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream and later as Rosalind in As You Like It.  She appeared with the Birmingham Repertory Company, where she performed in Ibsen\u2019s The Pillars of Society and The Wild Duck.  She also appeared in pantomime and musicals, including Dick Whittington and His Cat, The Toreador, Venus by George Grossmith, My Lady Molly and The Cingalee.  During World War I, she appeared in Fred Karno's 1915 revue 'All Women,' a show cast entirely of women, a novelty for the day. She also began to appear in films around this time.  Later stage roles included a role in First-Class Passengers Only (1927). She made a few television appearances, the last in an episode of the 1956 British series The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Cingalee", "response": ["*Nanoya (A Cingalese Girl) \u2013 Sybil Arundale"]}, {"page": "The Toreador", "response": ["*Isabella \u2013 Sybil Arundale"]}, {"page": "My Lady Molly", "response": ["The piece opened at the Theatre Royal in Brighton, England, on 11 August 1902 and then at Terry's Theatre in London on 14 March 1903, under the management of Frederick Mouillot, running for 342 performances.
