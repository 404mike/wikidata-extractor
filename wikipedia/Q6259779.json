Visitors noted a marked difference between the two sections of GQG with Gamelin's staff described as unfriendly and cold and Georges as more welcoming and cheerful.  A climate of mutual distrust existed between the two sections.  This has been compared to a cold war between Gamelin and Georges.  Georges said of Gamelin's reforms that \"he takes the GQG and leaves me with [the responsibility]\".
