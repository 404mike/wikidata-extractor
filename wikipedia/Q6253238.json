This voice type was called haute-contre, and the majority of heroic and amatory parts were written for it in grand opera and in op\u00e9ra-comique. This type reached its apex in the age of Rameau. It was, in fact, a type of tenor voice extremely light and widely ranged, but nearly systematically uttered in falsettone in the high pitch, so as to somehow re-echo the castrato \"contraltista\" of the Italian stamp.Caruselli, Grande, vol 4, p 1197, article: \"tenore\". This thesis, evidently borrowed from Rodolfo Celletti\u2019s positions, does not seem to have been fully shared explicitly, in Potter's recent work about the tenor voice.John Potter, Tenor, History of a voice, 2009, Yale University Press, New Haven and London. According to him, the main difference between the 18th century Italian tenor (no longer so deep a baritenor, or \"tenor-bass\",Potter, p. 18. as the seventeenth century one) and the French haute-contre, was that the former would use falsetto (and not falsettone, which Potter never explicitly mentions) above G4, whereas the latter would go up to B flat in full voice or, to be more exact, in a \"mixed head and chest voice, and not [in] the full chest voice that Italian tenors would develop later\" which is consistent with Celletti and the editor of Grande Enciclopedia\u2019s terminology, in falsettone.Potter, p. 23.", "* John Potter, Tenor, History of a voice, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2009, "]}, {"page": "Hilliard Ensemble", "response": ["The group was founded by  Paul Hillier, Errol Girdlestone, Paul Elliott, and David James, although the membership was flexible until Hillier left in 1990.

According to Celletti, the tenor voices used for leading roles in early baroque operas such as Jacopo Peri's Euridice (1600) and Claudio Monteverdi's Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) were essentially \"baritenor\" ones with a range common to both the baritone and tenor voices of today.Celletti (1989) p. 19 and Celletti (1996) p. 32 Much the same position was also adopted in 2000 by Fabrizio Dorsi in his history of Italian opera.Dorsi and Rausa, pp. 137\u2014138. In his 2009 book, Tenor: History of a voice, John Potter refers to this type of voice as \"tenor-bass\" and notes that several virtuoso singers of the 17th century who were described as \"tenors\" by their contemporaries could also sing in the bass register: Giulio Caccini, Giuseppino Cenci, Giovanni Domenico Puliaschi and Francesco Rasi.Potter (2009) pp. 17-18 Rasi created the title role in Monteverdi's first opera, L'Orfeo (1607),Whenham (1986) p. 5 which in modern times has been sung by tenors such as Anthony Rolfe JohnsonWhenham (1986) p. 113 as well as by lyric baritones, such as Simon Keenlyside.Holland (12 June 1999) Based on their descriptions in Vincenzo Giustiniani's Discorso sopra la musica (1628), Potter has suggested that singers such as Caccini, Cenci, Puliaschi, and Rasi, employed an \"open speech-like sound\" which facilitated the agility and clarity of expression for which their voices were renowned.Potter (2009) p. 17.

According to John Potter, it was mainly after coming to Italy in 1812 and meeting \u201cthe highly respected tenor and teacher Giovanni Ansani that he acquired the skills that would enable him to cope with Rossini. Ansani taught him how to project, and perhaps how to achieve the heavier sound that Mozart had recognized in all Italian singers as long ago as 1770, and presumably gave him the pedagogical rigour that would enable him to teach so authoritatively\u201d.Potter, p. 45 In fact, his \"voice was, according to F\u00e9tis, a deep tenor\":Radomski, Grove, p. 347. According to Radomski, \"it is possible that [Garc\u00eda\u2019s voice] was a baritone with a highly developed falsetto\"; which seems however rather inconsistent with Caruselli and Celletti\u2019s stating that Rossini's vocal writing for Garc\u00eda is usually higher-pitched than for other baritenors (cf. below) indeed, his singing had baritonal characteristics and has been presently referred to as baritenore, mainly in Italy.Caruselli, p. 506; Celletti, pp. 165\u2013166 Garc\u00eda possessed, however, an unusual vocal compass: although he was also able to cope with real baritone roles, the parts written for him by Rossini generally tend to be higher than those written for other baritonal tenors like Andrea Nozzari or Domenico Donzelli, and, according to Paolo Scudo's testimony,Paolo Scudo was a major critic of the Revue des Deux Mondes  \u2013 cf.
