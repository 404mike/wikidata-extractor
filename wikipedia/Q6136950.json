He also appeared in first-class cricket matches for the Wales team.\nJones was a left-handed lower- or middle-order batsman and a wicketkeeper. He appeared for Somerset in a single match in the 1922 season, and then became a regular player as a professional for the first two-thirds of the 1923 season, though he kept wicket only when amateur players, in particular Dar Lyon were not available. In addition to occasionally keeping wicket, Jones often made useful runs. In the match against Gloucestershire at Taunton he batted at No 7 and top-scored in the first innings with 70, which was his highest score for Somerset. He batted at No 3 in other matches and from there he made 50 in the match against Worcestershire at Kidderminster.Jones moved to Wales and played cricket for Gowerton Cricket Club while qualifying for Glamorgan. He played as a middle-order batsman and wicketkeeper in eight matches in 1928 and 1929, and against Essex at Leyton in 1928, scored 57 and 75, the second innings being the highest of his first-class career. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in its review of Glamorgan's 1928 season expressed the view that \"Jones may become the regular stumper\". But early in the 1929 season Jones lost his place in the side to Trevor Every and he never regained it. He played two first-class matches for the Wales side in 1929, but then  played local cricket in South Wales before becoming coach at Denstone College and later a publican in Staffordshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Jones", "response": ["James Jones may refer to:", "*James Jones (basketball coach) (born 1964), Yale University men's basketball head coach", "*James Jones (basketball, born 1980), American NBA basketball player and executive", "*James Jones (footballer, born 1873) (1873\u20131955), British Olympic footballer ", "*James Jones (footballer, born 1996), Scottish footballer for Wrexham ", "*James Jones (footballer, born 1997), Welsh footballer for Barrow", "*James Jones (defensive lineman) (born 1969), defensive lineman for Cleveland Browns, Denver Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, Detroit Lions", "*James Jones (running back, born 1958), running back for the Dallas Cowboys", "*James Jones (running back, born 1961), running back for Detroit Lions and Seattle Seahawks", "*James Jones (wide receiver) (born 1984)", "*James Jones (cricketer, born 1885) (1885\u20131953), cricketer for Somerset and Glamorgan in the 1920s", "*James Jones (cricketer, born 1870) (1870\u20131960), English cricketer", "*James Jones (baseball) (born 1988), professional baseball player", "*James Jones (sport shooter) (1871\u20131955), Canadian Olympic shooter", "*James Jones (rugby league) (fl. 1930), New Zealand rugby league player", "*James Jones (Georgia politician) (died 1801), Congressman, namesake of Jones County, Georgia", "*James Jones (South Dakota politician) (1927\u20132014), South Dakota politician", "*James Jones (Virginia politician) (1772\u20131848), U.S. Representative from Virginia", "*James Jones (bishop) (born 1948), former Anglican Bishop of Liverpool", "*James Jones (priest) (1881\u20131980), Church of England priest", "*James Jones (Archdeacon of Hereford) (1730\u20131823)", "*James Jones (author) (1921\u20131977), American novelist", "*James Jones (documentary maker) (born 1982), British documentary film-maker", "*Middle Walter (1935\u20131986), American blues harmonica player, born James Jones", "*Jimmy Jones (singer) (1937\u20132012), American singer, born James Jones", "*T.
