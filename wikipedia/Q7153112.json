West Bromwich Albion were starting to apply pressure early in the second half and Kevin Donovan came close to opening the scoring with a bicycle kick. Port Vale also had a 53rd-minute cross-cum-shot by Ian Taylor tipped over the bar by Tony Lange. Paul Musselwhite denied Donovan and Paul Raven after Bob Taylor exploited Port Vale defender Peter Swan's lack of pace. Swan fouled Taylor on 60 minutes and his subsequent dismissal proved to be the turning point in the match; it also meant that he became the third Englishman to be sent off at Wembley, after Kevin Keegan and Lee Dixon. Andy Hunt scored the game's opening goal on 66 minutes, and would make his loan spell from Newcastle United into a permanent transfer for a fee of \u00a3100,000 later in the week. Hunt had capitalised with a header from a goalmouth scramble when Gary Strodder's header was blocked by a combination of Musselwhite and the crossbar, and Taylor's cross was knocked on to Hunt by Nicky Reid. Reid scored his first goal for West Bromwich Albion with an  strike on 82 minutes after being assisted by Donovan, who countered a Port Vale attack by running past the halfway line. Reid repaid Donovan by setting him up for West Bromwich Albion's final goal from  on 90 minutes, with the game ending 3\u20130 to West Bromwich Albion.", "|CB ||5 ||Paul Raven"]}, {"page": "2003 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|DF ||4 ||Paul Raven"]}, {"page": "Paul Raven", "response": ["Paul Raven may refer to:", "* Paul Raven (musician) (1961\u20132007), British bassist mostly known for his work with the punk/rock band Killing Joke", "* Paul Raven, pseudonym of English musician Paul Gadd, better known as Gary Glitter", "* Paul Raven (footballer) (born 1970), English football player"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Football League Trophy", "response": ["|DF ||4 ||Paul Raven"]}, {"page": "Brian Makepeace", "response": ["His son-in-law is former West Bromwich Albion and Doncaster defender Paul Raven."]}, {"page": "Doncaster Rovers F.C.
