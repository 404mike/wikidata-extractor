His first bass was an Aria Pro, which he bought to rehearse with Draper \u2013 the pair would play along to drum loops in their bedrooms. Having not picked up an instrument prior to the formation of Mansun, King went on to become a solid bass player, with Bassist Magazine commenting in 1997 that despite being a relative newcomer to the instrument and being self-deprecating in interviews, \"Stove and Mansun drummer Andie Rathbone have formed a pretty solid bond in the rhythm department\".King also became a pivotal member of Mansun in terms of promoting the band. At one point, he operated an answerphone (nicknamed the Mansaphone \u2013 the phone number to which was printed on all the band's releases) installed in his house to update fans on news and also receive messages from them.\nKing left the band in late 2002 after several recording sessions for the album that was eventually released as Kleptomania, leading to the band's split.\nIt is claimed that the nickname Stove comes from a typo on his birth certificate, which read \"Stove\" instead of \"Steve\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ellesmere Port", "response": ["* Stove King (born 1974 in Ellesmere Port) an English musician, formerly the bassist for the rock band Mansun"]}, {"page": "Mansun", "response": ["Mansun were an English alternative rock band, formed in Chester in 1995. The band comprised vocalist/rhythm guitarist Paul Draper, bassist Stove King, lead guitarist/backing vocalist Dominic Chad, and drummer Andie Rathbone.", "Paul Draper and Stove King met in the early 1990s, whilst working in the printing industry as photo retouchers for rival companies situated opposite each other on the same industrial park in Little Stanney on the outskirts of Chester. Through their shared love of David Bowie and 1980s new wave bands including Duran Duran and ABC they started socialising together at weekends, going to gigs in Liverpool and playing along to drum loops together in their bedrooms with the desire of forming a band together.Reid, Pat, Burning Ambition - Mansun's Stove, web.archive.org. Retrieved August 2011 Whilst King was a relative newcomer to playing bass, Draper had previously formed and fronted the electronic duo Grind whilst studying at Thames Polytechnic (now University of Greenwich), with programmer-keyboard player Steve Heaton, and were often accompanied live by school friend Carlton Hibbert on drums. Grind released one 12\" single in 1991 on the small \"Whats in It For Me Records\" label and gigged around London at venues such as The Rock Garden and The Brain and also supported Beverley Craven at the Mean Fiddler. Following the split of Grind, Draper, funded by a grant from The Prince's Trust, set up a music company called \"Ambiance Productions\" producing relaxation tapes to be sold in \"hippie shops\" across the north west of England. In early 1995 Draper and King enlisted Maidstone expat Dominic Chad, who was the bar manager at the Fat Cat pub on Watergate Street in Chester opposite the office where Draper would go and see former Grind member Steve Heaton. Chad had previously played with \"Floating Bear\" formed whilst at Bangor University in 1990, where he had been studying French and Russian but was kicked off the course due to lack of effort. Chad would later admit that his routine during university was \"get up at three, go down to the union bar at four and stay there until it shut\". With the aid of a drum machine, the trio began rehearsing at Crash Rehearsal Studios in Liverpool, where the band were quickly discovered by passing A&R scouts Mark Lewis and Alan Wills (who later went on to form Deltasonic Records) who were there to see Cast and overheard the band through their rehearsal room door. The band were offered a publishing contract with Polygram Music Publishing four days after reluctantly handing over a demo tape of 4 songs that cost \u00a3150 to record featuring \"Take It Easy Chicken\", \"Skin Up Pin Up\", \"Moronica\" and \"She Makes My Nose Bleed\".", "*Stove King \u2013 bass (1995\u20132002)"]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Stove King (Mansun)"]}, {"page": "Little Kix", "response": ["* Stove King \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Six (Mansun album)", "response": ["*Stove King \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Kleptomania (album)", "response": ["Despite previewing several tracks from Kleptomania live on what was Mansun's final tour of 2002, Stove King's playing did not feature on any of the tracks which were included.
