A defender, he began his career at Chelsea, turning professional in May 1990 and then making his debut in the Football League in April 1991. He played on loan at West Bromwich Albion from December 1991 and March 1992. He established himself in the first-team back at Chelsea during the 1992\u201393 Premier League campaign and went on to be named as the club's Player of the Year for 1993. He played on the losing side in the 1994 FA Cup final, before picking up a winners medal after Chelsea beat Middlesbrough 2\u20130 in the 1997 final. Chelsea also won the League Cup by beating Middlesbrough 2\u20130 in the final the following year, and Sinclair scored the opening goal in extra-time. Chelsea also won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1998, though Sinclair was ruled out of the final due to injury.\nHe was sold on to Leicester City in August 1998 for a fee of \u00a32 million. He won his second League Cup final in 2000, as Leicester defeated Tranmere Rovers 2\u20131. He spent a total of six seasons at Leicester, five of which were spent in the Premier League, the exception being the 2002\u201303 First Division promotion campaign. He joined Championship club Burnley on a free transfer in June 2004 and served as club captain from January 2005 to summer 2006. He joined League One side Huddersfield Town on an emergency loan in February 2007, which became a permanent transfer in the summer. He dropped into League Two to join Lincoln City in July 2008, who loaned him out to Wycombe Wanderers in March 2009; he helped Wycombe to win promotion out of League Two at the end of the 2008\u201309 season. He then spent the next two seasons in the Conference with Wrexham, before playing for Hendon in November 2011 and Colwyn Bay in January 2012.\nBorn in England, he was called up to represent Jamaica at the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and played five games as the team finished in fourth-place after losing to Brazil in the third-place play-off match. He also played all three of his country's games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He went on to feature twice in the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup and ended his international career in October 2003 after a total of 28 caps.\nSinclair was appointed as player-manager at Colwyn Bay in February 2013 and was named as Conference North Manager of the Month in April and December 2013. He went on to serve Brackley Town as caretaker-manager in October 2015 and served as Hednesford Town manager from December 2015 to April 2016. He later spent time as a coach at Stoke City, Radcliffe, Port Vale and Doncaster Rovers.

Despite a good start to their campaign, the club fell into the relegation zone in the new year. Adams was clearly resentful of lucrative long-term contracts dealt out to his less talented players by previous managers, which restricted his ability to bring in fresh faces to boost their campaign. Leicester slipped back down again in 2003\u201304 to 18th place, bracketed together with the two other relegated sides \u2014 Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers \u2014 whose goal difference was inferior to Leicester's. The \"Foxes\" were becoming a \"yo-yo club\" and Adams blamed this on a lack of investment. During March 2004 nine Leicester players were arrested for various offences related to a drunken outing that ended with an alleged sexual assault on three German tourists, with three players being charged: Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie. The three faced up to fourteen years in prison if found guilty of rape, and the trio's bail totalled \u00a3196,500. The club had already been rocked by various incidents on overseas tours over years, with Stan Collymore arrested for setting off a fire extinguisher in 2000, and Dennis Wise breaking Callum Davidson's jaw in a row over a card game in 2002. Adams had previously initiated a crackdown in club discipline, going so far as to enforce random breathalyser tests. Adams said that \"in a lot of people's eyes, the players are guilty before they have had a fair trial \u2013 which is not the case\". The incident also cast doubt over Adams' future at the club, as reports surfaced that he planned to quit the club. He did in fact offer his resignation, which was rejected by the club. However, he kept faith in his players' innocence, and claimed \"if they are guilty of anything it is of being unprofessional \u2013 of being drunk to excess\". His faith was later vindicated when it transpired that all allegations against the players were false."]}, {"page": "Richmond Park (football ground)", "response": ["|Frank Sinclair"]}, {"page": "Jody Morris", "response": ["In September 2001, Morris, Chelsea teammates John Terry, Frank Lampard and Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen, and Leicester City's Frank Sinclair, were drunk and unruly in a Heathrow Airport hotel containing many Americans left stranded by the September 11 attacks.
