Smith travelled extensively across Great Britain working as a mineral surveyor allowing him to meet prominent people such as Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, and the Duke of Bedford. In 1815 he published this geological map, based on a John Cary map. It covered the whole of England and Wales, and parts of Scotland.

Conventional symbols were used to mark canals, tunnels, tramways and roads, collieries, lead, copper and tin mines, together with salt and alum works. The various geological types were indicated by different colours, applied by hand. Nevertheless, the map is remarkably similar to modern geological maps of England. It also included a 'Sketch of the succession of STRATA and their relative Altitudes'. This geological cross-section was not a new technique in itself, but its appearance on a map, with the clear intention of illustrating the relationship between relief and rocks and their structure, was novel. He published his Delineation of the Strata of England in the same year. In another of his books Strata Identified by Organized Fossils (London 1816\u20131819) he recognised that strata contained distinct fossil assemblages which could be used to match rocks across regions (Smith's laws). In 1817 he drew a remarkable geological section from Snowdon to London, a development of the \u2018sketch\u2019 on his map, illustrating the three-dimensional relationship between geology and landscape via a perspective sketch of the landscape showing the topography.
