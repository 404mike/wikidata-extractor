In 1900 he became manager of Gungunyana Farm close to the Chirinda Forest in the Chipinga District - this farm was also bought by Guy Marshall in 1902. Despite his lack of formal scientific education he began a career which would end with serious international recognition as an entomologist.Clement Gillman, 1882-1946: Biographical Notes on a Pioneer East African Geographer. East African Geographical Review. Makerere:Makerere University. Hoyle, Brian S. pp.116. . . . . For the following 19 years Swynnerton used the farm as a base and worked on comprehensive collections of plants, birds and insects, the plants being written up later in 1911 in J. Linn. Soc. (Bot.) 40:1-245 as Flora of Gazaland. The British Museum was a regular recipient of his plant and insect specimens which were lauded for displaying \"a precision in localisation and notes on economic uses which made this collection a model one\". He was elected a Fellow of the Linnaean Society in 1907. From the farm he made a number of collecting trips to the nearby Chimanimani Mountains. During this period Guy Marshall became chief editor of the Bulletin of Entomological Research and remained a close friend and mentor to Swynnerton.Flora of Zimbabwe"]}, {"page": "G. A. K.
