Following army service in India as a surgeon with the rank of lieutenant colonel, Fraser devoted himself entirely to dragonflies, mostly in the British Museum (Natural History), where his collection is maintained. Fraser's correspondence with A. Eric Gardner is in the library of the Natural History Museum, London. Fraser's correspondence with the Irish odonatologist Niall McNeill is in the Oxford University Museum. He was a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benty Grange helmet", "response": ["Work at the British Museum was overseen by keeper of the research laboratory Harold Plenderleith, who in some cases, particularly with the boar, did the work himself; additional input was provided by Bruce-Mitford, the technical attach\u00e9 and authority on ancient metalwork Herbert Maryon, and the archaeologist and art historian Fran\u00e7oise Henry. In the hundred years following its exposure to the air the helmet had continued to corrode, and certain parts had become indiscernible. The boar was unrecognizable, and the silver rivets and cross were almost completely obscured. A strong needle was used to pick off the encrustation, revealing the underlying features. During this process, the boar, hitherto thought solid, snapped in two. Bruce-Mitford termed this occurrence \"fortunate\", for it revealed the boar's inner structure. Frederic Charles Fraser examined the remnants of horn at the Natural History Museum, and conducted experiments softening and shaping modern horn."]}, {"page": "Aethiothemis basilewskyi", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Chlorocypha", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Coenagriocnemis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Indolestes", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Lokia coryndoni", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Malgassophlebia bispina", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Malgassophlebia", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Mortonagrion", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Platycypha", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Sinhalestes", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Tetrathemis denticauda", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Zygonoides", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser"]}, {"page": "Niall McNeill", "response": ["MacNeill is best known for his studies of larval Odonata on which he worked with A.
