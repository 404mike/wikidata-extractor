He is the eight time World Memory Champion and works as a trainer for Peak Performance Training.\nHe began developing his mnemonic techniques in 1987 when he saw Creighton Carvello memorise a pack of 52 playing cards in less than three minutes on the BBC television programme Record Breakers. To memorise numbers, O'Brien developed the mnemonic Dominic system, which is similar to the Major System. He has written books about memorisation techniques such as How to Develop a Perfect Memory, Quantum Memory Power, Learn to Remember, How to Pass Exams, The Winning Hand, and The Amazing Memory Box.\nHe gives lectures, and has been seen on television programmes such as The Human Body.Dominic O'Brien had an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for his 1 May 2002 feat of committing to memory a random sequence of 2808 playing cards (54 packs) after looking at each card only once. He was able to correctly recite their order, making only eight errors, four of which he immediately corrected when told he was wrong.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dominic system", "response": ["The Dominic system is a mnemonic system used to remember sequences of digits similar to the mnemonic major system.  It was invented and used in competition by eight-time World Memory Champion Dominic O'Brien.", "Using the Dominic system every pair of digits is first associated with Dominic O'Brien. He feels that stories and images created using people are easier to remember, this encoding is carried out ahead of time and the people are reused, since it can take quite some time."]}]}}
