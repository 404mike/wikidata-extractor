According to his biographer, Chisholm \"was the first composer to absorb Celtic idioms into his music in form as well as content, his achievement paralleling that of Bart\u00f3k in its depth of understanding and its daring\", which led some to give him the nickname \"MacBart\u00f3k\". As composer, performer and impresario, he played an important role in the musical life of Glasgow between the two World Wars and was a founder of the Celtic Ballet and, together with Margaret Morris, created the first full-length Scottish ballet, The Forsaken Mermaid. After World War II he was Professor and Head of the South African College of Music at the University of Cape Town for 19 years until his death. Chisholm founded the South African College of Music opera company in Cape Town and was a vital force in bringing new operas to Scotland, England and South Africa.
