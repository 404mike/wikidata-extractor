At the time it was seen as a continuing success story, but with hindsight it is considered that during Sir Richard Greenbury's tenure as head of the company, profit margins were pushed to untenable levels, and the loyalty of its customers was seriously eroded. The rising cost of using British suppliers was also a burden, as rival retailers increasingly imported their goods from low-cost countries, but M&S's belated switch to overseas suppliers undermined a core part of its appeal to the public. Another factor was the company's refusal (until 2001) to accept any credit cards except its own chargecard.", "* 1991\u20131999: Sir Richard Greenbury"]}, {"page": "Sir Richard Greenbury", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Greenbury."]}, {"page": "West London College", "response": ["* Sir Richard Greenbury, Chief Executive from 1988-99 of Marks & Spencer"]}, {"page": "Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies", "response": ["*Sir Richard Greenbury"]}, {"page": "Greenbury", "response": ["* Richard Greenbury (1936\u20132017), British businessman"]}, {"page": "1992 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Richard Greenbury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marks and Spencer plc."]}, {"page": "Roger Whiteside", "response": ["He joined Marks & Spencer in 1979, and worked with Sir Richard Greenbury, and helped to set up the Simply Food division.
