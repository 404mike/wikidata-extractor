Virgin Records was the most likely choice but Epic Records made a last minute offer and secured the Stranglers' services. The Stranglers once again had complete artistic freedom and in 1983 released their first album for Epic, Feline, which included the UK No.\u00a09 hit \"European Female\". The album was another change in musical direction, this time influenced by European music. It was the first Stranglers album to feature acoustic guitars, and it was on this album that Jet Black began to use electronic drum kits. Hugh Cornwell stated, \"On La Folie there were three tracks \u2013 'Golden Brown' ... 'La Folie' and 'How to Find True Love and Happiness in the Present Day' \u2013 that sort of pointed us away from what we had been doing. It was strange doing those tracks, because we'd never really attempted that quite minimalistic recording technique. And when we started writing for Feline, things were coming out the same way.\" The album gained much critical success but fell well short of La Folie in terms of sales and failed to produce another hit after \"European Female\". Nonetheless Feline broke the Stranglers in Europe and reached No.4 in the UK chart in January 1983.", "In 2014, the band celebrated their fortieth birthday with a Ruby Tour, throughout the UK and Europe. In 2015, the March On tour had 18 dates around the United Kingdom. Where stage space allowed, a second drum kit was set up and Jet Black appeared for a set of four songs.
