Born in South Wales, he studied at King's College, London, and then earned his Doctor of Philosophy at Worcester College, Oxford. He was employed at a number of institutions, eventually settling at the University of York where he became Dean of the History Faculty and director of the Centre for Medieval Studies. He researched and published widely, including nine books and over 80 book chapters. Ormrod retired in 2017 and died of cancer in 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward III of England", "response": ["This view is challenged in a 1960 article titled \"EdwardIII and the Historians\", in which May McKisack points out the teleological nature of Stubbs' judgement. A medieval king could not be expected to work towards some future ideal of a parliamentary monarchy as if it were good in itself; rather, his role was a pragmatic one \u2013 to maintain order and solve problems as they arose. At this, Edward excelled.McKisack (1960), pp. 4\u20135. Edward had also been accused of endowing his younger sons too liberally and thereby promoting dynastic strife culminating in the Wars of the Roses. This claim was rejected by K.B. McFarlane, who argued that this was not only the common policy of the age, but also the best. Later biographers of the king such as Mark Ormrod and Ian Mortimer have followed this historiographical trend. The older negative view has not completely disappeared; as recently as 2001, Norman Cantor described Edward as an \"avaricious and sadistic thug\" and a \"destructive and merciless force\"."]}, {"page": "John Hastings, 2nd Earl of Pembroke", "response": ["Pembroke soon returned to France and the war. It is possible that the King personally requested him to lead the campaign. The Gascons of south-west Francefirm allies of the Englishheld a favourable opinion of his previous efforts. The government viewed Pembroke as a commander in the style of those who had swept the French before them in the earlier years of the war. On 5 March 1372 he indentured with the King to serve in Aquitaine and was appointed lieutenant of Aquitaine on 20 April. Mark Ormrod has described the campaign as a minor one, as Pembroke was accompanied only by his personal retinue of 160 men. As well as them, the fleet carried \u00a312,000 in silver coin, to enable Pembroke to raise more men in France. Pembroke was instructed to recruit 500 knights, 1,500 esquires, and 1,000 archers. ", "Contemporary rumour put his defeat at La Rochelle down to his being\u2014as Cokayne put it\u2014\"a man of evil life, who had committed adultery, or to his having resolved to annul the liberties of the church\". Another contemporary chronicler described him as a \"homme de graunt renoune\". Modern historiography has been rather more nuanced. Pembroke's recent biographer has noted a certain immaturity of character\u2014particularly in his relationship with John Chandos\u2014whilst also noting that the biggest defeat of his career does not necessarily indicate lack of leadership or judgement on his part. The truth, R. I. Jack says, is that \"Pembroke was luckless and arrogant, but not necessarily incompetent\". Jonathan Sumption is more forgiving in his judgement, and describes Pembroke as an able man with, by the end of his life at least, \"political stature\". Sumption also sees Pembroke as \"intelligent, self-confident and ambitious\", if also \"hot-headed\", while Michael Prestwich notes that Pembroke \"lacked the outstanding ability\" that Edward III's captains had possessed in the 1340s and 1350s. Mark Ormrod describes him as a \"bellicose\" character"]}, {"page": "Issue of Edward III of England", "response": ["William of Hatfield (13361337), second son, was born at Hatfield near Doncaster in the West Riding of Yorkshire late in 1336, where Edward III kept Christmas with Queen Philippa.

Attempts to free him led to his transfer to the more secure Berkeley Castle in early April 1327. Plotting continued, and he was frequently moved to other places. Eventually being returned to Berkeley for good, Edward died there on the night of 21 September. Mark Ormrod described this as \"suspiciously timely\", for Mortimer, as Edward's almost-certain murder permanently removed a rival and a target for restoration."]}, {"page": "Coterel gang", "response": ["The kidnap of Richard Willoughby has been described by historians Anthony Musson and Mark Ormrod as a \"daring and very high-profile event\". He was captured in Melton Mowbray on 14 January 1332 and spirited away while on a judicial commission in the East Midlands. The Coterels, accompanied by members of the Folville gang, numbered between 20 and 30 men. In exchange for Willougby's life, they demanded 1,300 marks for his release. Willoughby was a wealthy man, and raised the necessary amount by the following day. Clearly, says Hanawalt, the risks associated with attacking such a prominent individual were deemed to be acceptable in expectation of such large amounts. The Folvilles received 300 marks of the ransom. It is likely that the Coterels and their associates were motivated at least in part by the fact that many of them would have come up against Willoughby on previous occasions in his capacity as a puisne judge who was regularly active on commissions of oyer and terminer in the region. It is known that in June 1329 he investigated the pillaging of the Earl of Lancaster's lands by the Coterels, and in 1331 he heard the complaint of the vicar of Bakewell over his eviction by the gang. Willoughby was notoriously corrupt\u2014the royal yearbooks would later report Willoughby as selling the laws of the land \"as if they were cattle or oxen\"\u2014and according to the near-contemporary Knighton's Chronicon, the Coterel associates had much to feel aggrieved about: Willoughby had been the judge in several cases against members of the group. He was, says Bellamy, \"thus a fit subject for humiliation\". His kidnap was almost certainly the chance for revenge \"for some wrong or imagined wrong once suffered\" as much as, if not more than, financial gain."]}, {"page": "John FitzWalter, 2nd Baron FitzWalter", "response": ["Thus outlawed, FitzWalter was judged guilty of multiple serious crimes, such as extortion and refusal to pay taxes. His fundamental offence, says Ward, was \"encroaching on the royal power\". FitzWalter's indictment roll, notes Margaret Hastings, listed so many offences that it \"read like an index to the record of indictment for a whole county\". On 31 January 1351, the King summoned FitzWalter by a writ of capias and he appeared before the King's Bench at Westminster Palace. Found guilty, he was cast into Marshalsea Prison and his estates confiscated. In November, FitzWalter was transferred to the Tower of London, where he was allocated ten shillings a day from his estates for his subsistence. FitzWalter, says the historian Mark Ormrod, had been \"publicly discredited\". The King not only wanted Essex to return to a state of peace, he also intended to make an example of FitzWalter to the nobility generally. The King, he argues, \"expected his beneficiaries to observe standards of behaviour more acceptable to him and to the political community\". Likewise, argues the medievalist Richard Partington, \"Edward's anger was especially terrifying in cases where he believed nobles were abusing their position to oppress others\". The King also did not, it seems, take FitzWalter's earlier loyal service in France into account when weighing up FitzWalter's punishment."]}, {"page": "2020 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Mark Ormrod, 62, historian, bowel cancer."]}, {"page": "2020 in Wales", "response": ["*2 August \u2013 Mark Ormrod, historian, 62 (bowel cancer)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2020", "response": ["*Mark Ormrod, 62, English historian, bowel cancer.Professor W.
