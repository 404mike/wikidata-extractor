A renowned knight who fought on the French side during the early years of the Hundred Years\u2019 War, Charny wrote a semi-autobiographical poem The Book of Geoffroi de Charny and a set of questions on chivalric matters for the short-lived Company of the Star, France\u2019s counterpart to England\u2019s Order of the Garter.  Although a prose treatise called the Book of Chivalry has also long been accredited to himRichard W. Kaeuper & Elspeth Kennedy, The Book of Chivalry of Geoffroi de Charny: Text, Context, and Translation. Middle Ages Series. (Philadelphia: Pennsylvania U.P, 1996). recent findings indicate this to have been more likely by his son of the same name, Geoffroi II de Charny, who died in 1398.Ian Wilson, The Book of Geoffroi de Charny, with the Livre Charny edited and translated by Nigel Bryant, (Woodbridge, The Boydell Press, 2021). Charny is also widely associated with the first known showings of the Shroud of Turin, though there are now doubts that he was responsible for these.   He took part in a successful crusading expedition to Smyrna in 1344 and shortly after his return from this King Philip VI appointed him a royal councillor and bearer of the Oriflamme, the sacred battle-standard of France.  This r\u00f4le, one in which he continued under King Jean II, made its holder an automatic target for enemy forces on a battlefield, and it was thus that he met his heroic end during the closing moments of the battle of Poitiers on September 19, 1356. Geoffroi de Charny was one of Europe's most admired knights during his lifetime, with a widespread reputation for his skill at arms and his honour. The Tournai-based abbot-chronicler Gilles le Muisit wrote of him: \u2018a vigorous soldier, expert in weaponry and much renowned both overseas and here. He has taken part in many wars and in many mortal conflicts, in all of them conducting himself with probity and with nobility\u2019.Gilles le Muisit Chronique et annales de Gilles le Muisit, abb\u00e9 de Saint-Martin de Tournai (1272-1352), ed. Henri Lemaitre (Paris 1906), p.295.", "In 1342 Charny led a cavalry charge at the battle of Morlaix in Brittany which foundered due to a cleverly-disguised trap laid by the English. Taken captive, Charny was transported to Goodrich Castle in England as the prisoner of Richard Talbot, 2nd Baron Talbot, who according to an English letters patent of October 1343 allowed  him to return to France to \u201cto find the money for his ransom\".Calendar of Patent Rolls 1343\u201345: 130. Having earlier performed some valuable services for Dauphin Humbert II de Viennois, for which he had been promised revenues from the Dauphin\u00e9 town of Saint-Marcellin, Charny urgently sought full payment of these, only to be baulked at every turn because of Humbert\u2019s chronic bankruptcy.Ian Wilson, 2021, op.cit., p.134. During the summer of 1344 he rode far to the south of France to confront Humbert face-to-face, but Humbert merely issued further irredeemable money orders, following which, instead of returning home, Charny seems to have boarded a sailing ship bound for the east, a voyage that he very graphically describes in his \u2018Book of Geoffroi de Charny\u2019 poem.Ibid., pp.116-118", "In the event, due to the French commanders\u2019 over-confidence of victory, Charny\u2019s advice was ignored, and King Jean successively launched all three divisions of his army against Edward the Black Prince\u2019s well-placed English forces in what became known as the battle of Poitiers.  The result was an overwhelming defeat for the French. Charny was killed gallantly upholding the Oriflamme to his last breath, and King Jean was obliged to surrender almost immediately after. Following the battle Charny\u2019s body was given a makeshift burial at a nearby Franciscan convent, however in 1370 his remains were exhumed, transported to Paris, and solemnly reburied in the city\u2019s prestigious church of the Celestines.Ian Wilson, 2021, op.cit., p.29.  There his hero\u2019s tomb was one of the many casualties of the French Revolution.", "Three literary works: (1) a Livre Charny poem known as the \u2018Book of Geoffroi de Charny\u2019; (2) a set of questions on jousting, tourneys and war; and (3) a lengthy prose Livre de Chevalerie or \u2018Book of Chivalry\u2019 are preserved in a handsomely bound manuscript in the Royal Library in Brussels long regarded as the prime authority for Charny\u2019s writings.Royal Library of Brussels, MS. 11124-26.   Although handwriting specialists having dated this manuscript to at least a generation after Charny\u2019s lifetime, leading scholars have understandably assumed Charny to have been the \u2018Book of Chivalry\u2019s author. Recently, however, this assumption has become seriously challenged by the discovery of two other Charny manuscripts, one in Oxford,Bodleian Library, Oxford, Holkham Misc.43.  the other in Madrid,Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a, Madrid MS. 9270, online http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?lang=en&id=0000139688&page=1 both self-evidently prepared for practical use by the Company of the Star, the French counterpart to England\u2019s Order of the Garter.  Due to King Jean II peremptorily shutting it down, the Company existed for only a single year, 1352, and a similarly abrupt abandonment evident in the Oxford and Madrid manuscripts enables these too to be dated to the same year,Ian Wilson, 2011 op.cit, chapter 2. thereby within Charny\u2019s lifetime.  Whilst both the manuscripts contain the \u2018Book of Geoffroi de Charny\u2019 and his set of questions (the latter notably with blank spaces left for the Company\u2019s answers), neither of them has the \u2018Book of Chivalry\u2019, an omission now readily explicable thanks to a fine recent translation of the \u2018Book of Geoffroi de Charny\u2019 by medieval specialist Nigel Bryant.Ibid., pp.109-128.   This never-before-translated poem reveals such subtle yet telling personality and style differences between its author and whoever wrote the \u2018Book of Chivalry\u2019 that it now seems highly unlikely that the latter was composed by Charny.  More logically, it was the work of his son of the same name, who though a tiny infant at the time of his father\u2019s death, undoubtedly tried to emulate his military and political career, including going on crusade.  Via the Brussels manuscript Geoffroi II de Charny arguably sought to honour and preserve his father\u2019s abandoned chivalric works by including them along with his own brand-new \u2018Book of Chivalry\u2019.", "There has long seemed to be no explanation for this dichotomy, until 2009 when metal detectorists exploring a field in Machy, the next-door village to Lirey, turned up a casting mold for a Shroud pilgrim badge which although partly damaged is clearly of a type similar to that found in Paris, yet with certain very significant differences.Ian Wilson \u2018The Earliest Pilgrim Badges Produced for the So-Called \u2018Shroud of Turin\u2019, Peregrinations: Journal of Medieval Art and Architecture (Gambier, Ohio, Spring 2021), pp.174-211.  Although the Shroud is again depicted accompanied by the Charny and Vergy coats of arms, the shields\u2019 positioning is reversed, that of Jeanne de Vergy\u2019 now being in the dexter, or \u2018in charge\u2019 position, with Charny\u2019s subordinate to this.  And whereas a banner-like label that was once on the Paris badge has long been almost completely lost due to the damage, on the Machy badge its straight-line inscription is intact, reading \u2019SVAIRE IhV\u2019, \u2018Shroud of Jesus\u2019. Clear from this is that it was created for the authenticity-claiming showings that had so enraged Bishop Henri de Poitiers, and it was Charny\u2019s very young wife Jeanne de Vergy who had been in overall charge of these.  Whatever the circumstances that had prompted the showings, they had evidently been held shortly after Charny\u2019s 1356 death rather than before it.  As for the pilgrim badge found in Paris, in the light of certain styling characteristics, notably its banner-type inscription (which probably read simply \u2018SVAIRE\u2019, as appears on some later pilgrim badges featuring banner-borne inscriptions), this was most likely commissioned by Charny\u2019s son Geoffroi II de Charny for showings that he is known to have held in 1389, apparently incorporating his mother Jeanne de Vergy as his co-sponsor.", "* Ian Wilson, The Book of Geoffroi de Charny, with the Livre Charny edited and translated by Nigel Bryant, (Woodbridge, The Boydell Press, 2021).", "* Ian Wilson, The Earliest Pilgrim Badges Produced for the So-Called \u2018Shroud of Turin\u2019, Peregrinations: Journal of Medieval Art and Architecture (Gambier, Ohio, Spring 2021), pp.174-211.
