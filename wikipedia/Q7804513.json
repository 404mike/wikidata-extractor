When Wonnacott ceased presenting, the format changed to a rota of hosts from a \"team of experts\" fronting the series.", "In the early David Dickinson-era episodes, teams were given \u00a3200 each, and could buy as many or as few items as they liked within the hour given to wander around a trade fair. The item rule was later changed so that teams have to buy three items. After Tim Wonnacott became host, the money was increased to \u00a3300, and a new feature called the \"swap item\" was introduced. Each expert chose an item of their own, and the team could replace one of their own choices with the \"swap item\" if they wished to. The host, when offering the option to a team, would often ask, \"Swap or No Swap?\" Originally, the experts were given an unspecified amount of money to buy the extra item; the rule was later changed so that the experts could only use whatever money was left of the team's \u00a3300 budget (the remaining money was referred to by Wonnacott as the \"leftover lolly\"). Under the revised rule, if a team used its entire budget, the expert could not choose a \"swap item\".", "A separate celebrity version of the show premiered on 1 December 2008 on BBC Two featuring team pairs made up of one well-known personality accompanied by a friend or family member. The show is presented by Tim Wonnacott and the format is the same as the main show but Wonnacott's visit to see an antiques collection or stately home is replaced by a feature where each celebrity contestant discusses antiques with him. Wonnacott might show them a borrowed collection of antiques brought along for the show that he believes would interest the celebrity (this may be related to the occupation of the celebrity), and in turn the celebrity shows Wonnacott an antique or collectable belonging to themselves. There is no suggestion of what to do with any profit if the teams make any, but most decide to give it to charity.
