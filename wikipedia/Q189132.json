Julia and Grant go to the wedding planner named Jell-O (Valery Ortiz), who has massive buttocks. Julia stresses that she wants a traditional wedding, but Jell-O suggests that they go to a restaurant called Taco Butt, which they decline. However, she gets upset and tells them that's the best she can do on short notice. Grant tries to ease the awkward situation by saying he has a best man they will meet up with later, which relaxes Jell-O as she shows them what she has booked for the entertainment. Jell-O uses her butt to knock over her desk, then aggressively rips off her clothes to reveal a gold spandex bra and tights, shocking the couple and revealing that she is the wedding entertainment. She shows off her dance moves until she backs up to them as they scream in fear, while she joyfully crushes & smothers them with her butt, getting even on declining her earlier offer.
