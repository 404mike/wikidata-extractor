The party was led for much of its existence by Colonel Edward James Saunderson and later by William St John Brodrick, Earl of Midleton. In total, eighty-six members of the House of Lords affiliated themselves with the Irish Unionist Alliance, although its broader membership was relatively small.", "The Irish Unionist Alliance was founded in 1891 by the members of the Irish Loyal and Patriotic Union (ILPU), which it replaced.Alvin Jackson, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Irish History (Oxford University Press, 19 March 2014), 52. The ILPU had been established to prevent electoral competition between Liberals and Conservatives in the three southern provinces on a common platform of maintenance of the union.Graham Walker, A History of the Ulster Unionist Party: Protest, Pragmastism and Pessimism (Manchester University Press, 4 September 2004) The IUA united this movement with unionists in the northern province of Ulster, where unionist sentiment and support was strongest.Grenfell Morton, Home Rule and the Irish Question (Routledge, 15 July 2014), 32. As such, the new party sought to represent unionism on an all-Ireland basis. The party's founders hoped that this would coordinate the electoral and lobbying activities of unionist across Ireland. Prior to 1891, unionists had seen considerable electoral losses across southern Ireland at the hands of the pro-Home Rule Irish Parliamentary Party, founded a decade earlier.Travis L. Crosby, Joseph Chamberlain: A Most Radical Imperialist (I.B.Tauris, 30 March 2011), 102. It was deemed necessary for southern and northern supporters of the Union to more formally unite their efforts. At this stage, the majority of unionists in all parts of Ireland were opposed to the Irish Home Rule movement, especially following the collapse of the Irish wing of the Liberal Party. The IUA's first leader was the Orangeman and former Conservative MP, Edward James Saunderson.", "The Irish Unionist Alliance had no formal method of electing and deposing of its leadership, and leaders of the IUA were more informally 'acknowledged' by other prominent figures. The party's first leader was Edward James Saunderson, a former Conservative Member of Parliament, who was most active in attempting to create an all-Ireland unionist movement. Towards the end of the party's existence, leadership became fractured between the northern and southern unionist movements within the alliance.", "| Edward James Saunderson || 1891\u20131906"]}, {"page": "Saunderson", "response": ["* Edward James Saunderson (1837\u20131906), Anglo-Irish politician and landowner, Alexander's son."]}, {"page": "Cavan (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Edward James Saunderson"]}, {"page": "North Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Rt Hon.
