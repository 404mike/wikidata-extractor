He then received a phone call from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, but Southall's hostile phone manner put Ferguson off the idea of signing him, and Ferguson instead bought Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. Howard Kendall returned as Everton manager in November, with Colin Harvey being demoted to his assistant, and led the club out of relegation trouble to secure a ninth-place finish.

Everton reached the 1968 FA Cup Final, but lost to West Bromwich Albion and were knocked out by Manchester City in the semi-finals the following year.

At the time Everton boasted more recent success than Manchester United, having won two league titles, an FA Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. Manager Colin Harvey was planning to boost the \"Toffees\" chances of more silverware, and also in 1989 signed Mike Newell, Martin Keown, Stefan Rehn and Raymond Atteveld. Whiteside became Everton's playmaker in 1989\u201390, and formed an effective partnership with Stuart McCall in midfield to score 13 goals in his 35 appearances.

Everton's form improved under Kendall and they finished ninth, also reaching the FA Cup quarter-finals and ousting Liverpool in the fifth round after two replays; Cottee was Everton's saviour in the first replay on 21 February as he scored a late equaliser which forced a 4\u20134 draw in Liverpool's last game before the resignation of manager Kenny Dalglish the following day.

With Everton, Kendall won the First Division title, the Charity Shield, and was again an FA Cup runner-up. He became Everton captain for three years before being sold to Birmingham City in 1974.

This was despite the fact he had built a strong Manchester City side that was near the top of the First Division table, and had only just held their cross-city rivals Manchester United to a thrilling 3\u20133 draw at Maine Road. He famously justified the move by saying that Manchester City was just an affair, but Everton was his marriage. By this stage Everton were battling against relegation to the Second Division, but he turned their season around and they managed to finish ninth and also reach the FA Cup quarter-finals, defeating Liverpool in the fifth round."]}, {"page": "Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School", "response": ["* Colin Harvey (footballer 1960s & 70s for England, Everton F.C. and Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)"]}]}}
