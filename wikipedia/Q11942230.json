Whether those people had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known.

Excavation by the Oxford Archaeological Unit in the late 1990s revealed the existence of a Neolithic longhouse close to the White Horse Stone. It was stylistically very similar to longhouses belonging to the linearbandkeramic (LBK) and post-LBK cultures of central and north-western Europe, which are dated to the 5th and 6th millennia BCE. Three of the building's post holes contained sherds of Early Neolithic ceramic Plain Bowls, which were radiocarbon dated to 4110\u20133530 cal BCE. In the vicinity, sherds of Clacton-style Grooved Ware and Mortlake-style Peterborough ware ceramics were also found, dating from the Mid-to-Late Neolithic, suggesting that activity continued at the site over a long period of time (c.3750\u20132250 BCE). It is not known what the purpose of the longhouse was, or whether it was primarily domestic or ritualistic in function, although excavators expressed their opinion that it was probably domestic and communal in use. Conversely, the archaeologist Paul Ashbee thought it likely that it was a \"cult-house\" on the basis of its isolated nature. Evidence of a smaller, circular building was found to the south-east of the longhouse, although this might have been later in date. Ashbee highlighted that the stone long barrows stylistically emulated the wooden long houses, and that this was probably an act of conscious imitation.", "Chestnuts Long Barrow is located around 100 metres north-west of Addington long barrow. The mound itself no longer exists, although the eastern end of the barrow is still marked out by sarsens, some of which have been re-erected to their original positions. Although the earthen mound no longer exists in any form, it has been estimated that it would have been 20 metres long and around 15 metres wide. The chamber would have been 12\u00a0ft long, 7\u00a0ft wide, and 9\u00a0ft high, thus being described by Paul Ashbee as being of \"huge and unusual proportions\".

The best known of these are the Medway Megaliths, all of which are found in the vicinity of the River Medway and each of which contains a stone burial chamber. This use of stone as a building material sets these Medway Megaliths apart from Julliberrie's Grave and the Stour long barrows. The decision by the builders of the Stour long barrows to not use stone was likely deliberate, for sarsens are naturally present in the local area and could have been obtained had they wanted them. Archaeologists recognise the Stour long barrows as a distinct regional grouping of this form of monument. The archaeologist Paul Ashbee thought that there was a typological link between Julliberrie's Grave and the long barrows on the chalk downlands of Sussex, despite the fact that they are over fifty miles apart from each other. The three tumuli are located within eight kilometres of each other, high up on the North Downs between Canterbury and Ashford. As of 1998, Julliberrie's Grave is the only one of the trio to have been archaeologically excavated.", "Romano-British finds are commonly located in and around Early Neolithic monuments, and at Julliberries' Grave there is evidence for what the archaeologist Paul Ashbee called \"more than [a] casual Romano-British interest\". Archaeologists found several Romano-British burials\u2014both inhumations and cremations\u2014just to the south of the long barrow. \"Roman Burial I\" was an inhumation of a child aged between 5 and 7, lain on its back with its feet to the northeast. It had been buried with a bronze brooch used to pin a shroud, as well as a bronze bracelet on its right arm and both a pottery dish and a cup by its head, all artefacts dated to the middle of the first century CE. \"Roman Burial II\" contained a female skeleton aged around 17 at the time of death. She was positioned on her back with her feet facing westward. Interred with the grave were a dish and a cup, both also dated to the middle of the first century CE. Between Burial I and II was an area of \"greasy yellow chalk\", which the excavators believed represented evidence for the burial of an infant. \"Roman Burial III\" contained six pottery vessels: a flagon, a butt-shaped beaker, two small cups, a dish, and a wide-mouthed bowl containing the cremated remains of a human cranium, as well as parts of the thorax and the long bones of a young adult. The bowl was placed atop six contiguous cervical vertebrae and a severed hand.

The original excavation records of the mound were destroyed during World War II, and only pictures of the rivets in the sand remain as evidence.
