Jodie is introduced as the new owner of Diggory Compton's old bakery, along with her father Jerry (Michael Starke). Jodie and her grandfather, Wilf, arrive on Coronation Street, in January 2007, to ask Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward) why the re-fit on the bakery is taking so long. She later finds out Charlie has been murdered, and asks his colleague Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) to continue with the re-fit. She also calls Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) \"cheesey\" when he attempts to flirt with her. Jodie enjoys arguing with rival chip shop worker, Cilla Battersby-Brown (Wendi Peters). Cilla states that Jodie has the body of her father, Jerry Morton, and the face of 'Jabba The Hut'. Cilla also calls an exterminator and lies that the kebab shop, which they had now named \"Jerry's Kebabs\", is infested with rats. Jodie then retaliates by calling Cilla a liar. As part of the ongoing feud, Jodie takes Cilla's son Chesney's (Sam Aston) dog Schmeichel and keeps him in the family's garden shed later letting him go. Jodie has a brief romance with Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles). On 14 July 2007 it was announced that Seager was leaving Coronation Street. Jodie leaves Weatherfield on 11 November 2007, after feeling that Jerry had taken her for granted too many times and goes to live with a friend in London.", "Wilfred \"Wilf\" Morton is the father of Jerry Morton (Michael Starke). Wilf arrived on the street with his granddaughter, Jodie (Samantha Seager). He called Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) \"chief\", which Dev took to be a racist comment. However, Jodie explained that Wilf was not good with names and that this was simply his method of addressing people informally. Wilf was an ex-convict with an extensive criminal record, mostly as a result of his tendency to take part in scams, a trait that many members of his family had inherited. On discovering his granddaughter Mel's (Emma Edmondson) ambition to join the police, Wilf claimed he felt it was like \"being stabbed\". However, despite his former misdemeanours, Wilf was loyal to his family and after realising that his past record may have affected Mel and her application to join the Police, Wilf faked his death on Father's Day 2007, by submitting a false obituary to the Weatherfield Gazette. This action lead to Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) and Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) believing he was dead - with the former arranging her own wake, despite still being alive, as a result. Wilf's intentions towards Blanche were never fully established; while the two often bickered, Blanche was genuinely shocked when she believed Wilf was dead, and Wilf made several flirtatious comments towards her. Although he appeared to live with his son and grandchildren, Wilf's appearances suddenly ceased and he was not referred to when his family left the Street in September 2008.

In June 2008, Teresa briefly cons Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) into thinking Finlay is his son so that she can get money out of him.
