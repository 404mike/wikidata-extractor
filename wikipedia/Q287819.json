In Gaul, Spain, and Britain, moreover, Christians already had far more than Galerius was offering to Eastern Christians. Other late 20th-century historians, like Graeme Clark and David S.

In Egypt, Peter of Alexandria fled his namesake city early on in the persecution, leaving the Church leaderless. Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis (Asyut), took up the job in his place. Meletius performed ordinations without Peter's permission, which caused some bishops to complain to Peter. Meletius soon refused to treat Peter as any kind of authority, and expanded his operations into Alexandria. According to Epiphanius of Salamis, the Church split into two sections: the \"Catholic Church\", under Peter, and, after Peter's execution, Alexander; and the \"Church of the Martyrs\" under Meletius.Leadbetter, 259. When the two groups found themselves imprisoned together in Alexandria during the persecution, Peter of Alexandria drew up a curtain in the middle of their cell. He then said: \"There are some who are of my view, let them come over on my side, and those of Melitius's view, stay with Melitius.\" Thus divided, the two sects went on with their affairs, purposely ignoring each other's existence.Epiphanius, Panarion 68.3.3, qtd. and tr. in MacMullen, 92\u201393. The schism continued to grow throughout the persecution, even with its leaders in jail,MacMullen, 160 n.17. and would persist long after the deaths of both Peter and Meletius.

Ammianus reports on further miscarriages: \"Meanwhile Constantius' sister Helena, wife of Julian Caesar, had been brought to Rome under pretence of affection, but the reigning queen, Eusebia, was plotting against her; she herself had been childless all her life, and by her wiles she coaxed Helena to drink a rare potion, so that as often as she was with child she should have a miscarriage. For once before, in Gaul, when she had borne a baby boy, she lost it through machination: a midwife had been bribed with a sum of money, and as soon as the child was born cut the umbilical cord more than was right, and so killed it; such great pains and so much thought were taken that this most valiant man might have no heir.\"The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 1, Book 16, chapter 10. 1935 translation In the historical study \"Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality\" (1998) by Timothy Barnes, the birth of this stillborn son is estimated to 356. The miscarriage in Rome to 357. Barnes considers the story of the potion-induced miscarriages to be an allegation without further reference.Timothy Barnes, \"Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality\" (1998), page 123 Gibbon had not completely dismissed the report: \"even the fruits of his [Julian's] marriage-bed were blasted by the jealous artifices of Eusebia  herself, who, on this occasion alone, seems to have been unmindful of the tenderness of her sex, and the generosity of her character\" ... \"For my own part I am inclined to hope that the public malignity imputed the effects of accident as the guilt of Eusebia.\" He left the question of the existence of such a poison open and to be determined by physicians rather than historians. \"A History of Medicine\" (1995) by Plinio Prioreschi dismisses the account as an example of a very common error in accounts of ancient medicine, \"the attribution to drugs of properties that they could not have\". In this case, a potion which is consumed just once and keeps having effect for years. Prioreschi regards it as \"an obvious impossibility in the light of modern pharmacology\".Plinio Prioreschi, \"A History of Medicine\" (1995), page 658", "Helena is next mentioned by Ammianus as already deceased for some time: Julian \"being now an Augustus, he celebrated quinquennial games; and he wore a magnificent diadem, set with gleaming gems, whereas at the beginning of his principate he had assumed and worn a cheap crown, like that of the director of a gymnasium attired in purple. While these games were going on, he had sent to Rome the remains of his deceased wife Helena, to be laid to rest in his villa near the city on the Via Nomentana, where also her sister Constantina, formerly the wife of Gallus, was buried.\"The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 2, Book 21, chapter 1. 1940 translation In his assessment of Julian, Ammianus claims Julian practiced chastity and avoided sexual intercourse for the rest of his life. \"He was so conspicuous for inviolate chastity that after the loss of his wife it is well known that he never gave a thought to love: bearing in mind what we read in Plato, that Sophocles, the tragic poet, when he was asked, at a great age, whether he still had congress with women, said no, adding that he was glad that he had escaped from this passion as from some mad and cruel aster. Also, to give greater strength to this principle, Julianus often repeated the saying of the lyric poet Bacchylides, whom he delighted to read, who declares that as a skilful painter gives a face beauty, just so chastity gives charm to a life of high aims. This blemish in the mature strength of manhood he avoided with such care, that even his most confidential attendants never (as often happens) accused him even of a suspicion of any lustfulness.\"The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus, vol. 2, Book 25, chapter 4. 1940 translation Barnes notes that Ammianus offers much praise of both Julian and Eusebia. In contrast, there is no such praise for Helena, nor an actual assessment of her.Timothy Barnes, \"Ammianus Marcellinus and the Representation of Historical Reality\" (1998), pages 122-123"]}, {"page": "Timothy D Barnes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Timothy Barnes (classicist)"]}, {"page": "Timothy D.
