Born in Liverpool, McLaughlin was the son of an Irish republican and socialist, who was a veteran of the International Brigades.According to his blog, his father was a good friend of Irish playwright Se\u00e1n O'Casey, and shared battle experiences with war correspondent and international author, Ernest Hemingway. His mother corresponded with Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri (La Pasionaria) during the Spanish Civil War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neo-Nazism", "response": ["During the late 1970s, a British subculture came to be associated with neo-Nazism; the skinheads. Portraying an ultra-masculine, crude and aggressive image, with working-class references, some of the skinheads joined the British Movement under Michael McLaughlin (successor of Colin Jordan), while others became associated with the National Front's Rock Against Communism project which was meant to counter the SWP's Rock Against Racism. The most significant music group involved in this project was Skrewdriver, led by Ian Stuart Donaldson. Together with ex-BM member Nicky Crane, Donaldson founded the international Blood & Honour network in 1987. By 1992 this network, with input from Harold Covington, had developed a paramilitary wing; Combat 18, which intersected with football hooligan firms such as the Chelsea Headhunters. The neo-Nazi skinhead movement spread to the United States, with groups such as the Hammerskins. It was popularised from 1986 onwards by Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance. Since then it has spread across the world. Films such as Romper Stomper (1992) and American History X (1998) would fix a public perception that neo-Nazism and skinheads were synonymous."]}, {"page": "British Movement", "response": ["After Jordan stood down as leader of the BM Michael McLaughlin, a former milkman from Liverpool, became the leader.R. Hill & A. Bell, The Other Face of Terror, p. 124 McLaughlin, who was seen as a talented organiser but weak leader, was largely believed to have been chosen as little more than a \"front\" leader who could be controlled by Jordan from behind the scenes.R. Hill & A. Bell, The Other Face of Terror, p. 120 McLaughlin quickly rejected this notion and made it clear that Jordan's time was over, resulting in the former leader retiring to Yorkshire from where he still published his own journal Gothic Ripples from time to time, the pages of which were regularly filled with criticism of McLaughlin."]}]}}
