He appeared in the Orange mobile phone cinema adverts in the UK (with Brennan Brown), playing the role of Eliot, a spoof studio executive, and has appeared regularly in the BBC comedy television programme Little Britain as well as cabaret character Lenny Beige.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kenneth Horne", "response": ["The seventh series of Beyond Our Ken finished in February 1964, with an average audience of ten million listeners per programme. In September that year Horne returned from holiday and was scheduled to appear in a number of programmes; Eric Merriman objected to Horne's activities, saying that Horne had been made into a star by the writer, and that \"no other comedy series should be allowed to use him\". When the BBC refused to withdraw Horne from the second programme, Down with Women, Merriman resigned from writing Beyond Our Ken and the show came to an end. After some pressure from Horne to keep the remainder of the team together, the BBC commissioned a replacement series, Round the Horne, on similar lines. They turned to one of the original writers of Beyond Our Ken, Barry Took and his new writing partner, Marty Feldman. Horne remained the genial and unflappable focal figure, and the writers invented several new and eccentric characters to revolve round him. They included J. Peasemold Gruntfuttock, the walking slum; the No\u00ebl Coward parodies Charles and Fiona; the incompetent villain Dr. Chou En Ginsberg; the folk singer Rambling Syd Rumpo and the \"outrageously camp\" Julian and Sandy. The resulting programme was described by radio historians Andy Foster and Steve Furst as \"one of the seminal comedies to come out of the BBC\", while The Spectator described it as \"one of the great radio successes\". The first series of Round the Horne, consisting of 16 episodes, ran from March to June 1965. Horne's role was to provide \"the perfect foil to the inspired lunacy happening all around him\":"]}, {"page": "Round the Horne", "response": ["As in Beyond Our Ken, there was a cast of recurring characters. Took and Feldman developed new characters for Williams, Paddick, Marsden and Pertwee, whose ability to change between personas produced a programme described by the radio historians Andy Foster and Steve Furst as \"a cast of thousands played by the same four accomplished actors\". Horne's role was described in The Daily Telegraph as providing \"the perfect foil to the inspired lunacy happening all around him\". The media analysts Frank Krutnik and Steve Neale consider that as such, Horne's role was similar to that of Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Tommy Handley, \"as a 'stooge' rather than a joke-wielder, frequently switching roles between announcer and in-sketch performer\"."]}, {"page": "It's That Man Again", "response": ["The comedian Tommy Handley started as a music hall comedian before becoming a regular feature on BBC radio from 1924. By the end of the 1920s he was, according to the writers Andy Foster and Steve Furst, a household name in Britain; his popularity continued into the 1930s. The scriptwriter Ted Kavanagh was a fan of Handley and wrote a script for a comedy sketch for him in 1926.
