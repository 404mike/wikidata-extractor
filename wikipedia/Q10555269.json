However it would be 20-year old centre-back Nathan Smith who would prove to be the club's best player; Riberio handed him his debut on the opening day of the season, and Smith would retain his first-team place long after Riberio's departure. He appointed Jak Alnwick, Ben Purkiss and Anthony Grant as joint-captains, and got off to a good start by winning his first six home games at Vale Park. He was named as the Football League Paper's League One Manager of the Day after Vale defeated Scunthorpe United 3\u20131 on 27 August. However they entered Christmas in 17th-place, leaving chairman Norman Smurthwaite to declare that 'Plan B' had been triggered, meaning the signing of \"seasoned, higher grade\" players, whilst he admitted he felt \"a little bit hoodwinked\" as Ribeiro's friends in the game (Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Aitor Karanka, and Carlos Carvalhal) had provided him with glowing references but had thus far failed to lend any of their players to the Vale. Ribeiro resigned as manager of Port Vale on 26 December, hours after witnessing his side lose 1\u20130 at home to Walsall.

He started just two of the opening ten games of the 2016\u201317 season and found himself competing with Martin Paterson behind Anton Forrester in the first team pecking order; Cicilia said that additional conditioning work helped him to adjust to the physicality of the English game. He scored his first goal for the club on 22 October, and then won a penalty, as the \"Valiants\" came from behind to draw 2\u20132 with Oxford United at Vale Park. His size and unconventional playing style quickly made him a 'cult hero' for Vale fans, who nicknamed him 'Reggie'. However Bruno Ribeiro rarely played Cicilia form the start of matches, believing him to be more of an impact substitute. He was sidelined with a calf strain injury in February. He returned to action after a four-week absence, but failed to add to his goal tally, and was sent off for two bookable offence on the final home game of the season \u2013 a 2\u20130 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on 22 April; caretaker-manager Michael Brown said that the sending off was harsh.

A pair of English players then joined the club, former Premier League veteran winger Jerome Thomas and 22-year old former Blackburn Rovers forward Anton Forrester. Bookmakers made Vale second favourites for relegation, though Smurthwaite intimated that he expected the club to reach the play-offs. Andy Smith was confirmed as the club's new first team coach whilst the club decided to not hire Peter Farrell after all; Farrell only found out the news on his future after he heard it reported on the radio, and said \"It would have been more respectful if someone had the decency to ring me up rather than leave it for 10 days\". The club's Player of the Year, Anthony Grant, then submitted a transfer request. The playing squad however continued to grow, with a 12th signing, Monaco reserve team captain S\u00e9bastien Amoros, signing a 12-month contract. The signing of 20-year old midfielder Nathan Ferguson then took the club to 13 new players, and Ribeiro said he wanted to further expand the squad by securing the services of veteran trialist Nathan Tyson. However he lost a player, as right-back Adam Yates was ruled out of action for seven months with an ankle cruciate ligament injury.

He remained eligible to play in non-first team fixtures for Birmingham City during the loan spell. He made his Football League debut at Vale Park on 16 August, as an 84th-minute substitute for Anton Forrester in a 1\u20130 win over Rochdale; he won a penalty within two minutes of coming onto the field, though JJ Hooper missed the ensuing penalty, and Jones also had a shot blocked by the last defender after running past goalkeeper Josh Lillis deep into stoppage time. On 27 August, he scored twice to help the \"Valiants\" record a 3\u20131 victory over Scunthorpe United despite being played at wide right of the front three. Manager Bruno Ribeiro praised him after the match, saying that \"he was fantastic. He scored two goals and worked hard.\u00a0... He is one more option for a winger\". His performance won him a place on the Football League Paper's League One Team of the Day. Jones said that he enjoyed playing out of position at right-wing for Port Vale as Ribeiro allowed him a free creative role with few defensive duties, and he also admitted he hoped to extend the loan as he did not suit the style of play at his parent club. He was nominated for the League One Player of the Month award for August and September after scoring six goals in eight games. By the end of his loan spell, Jones had scored ten goals from 21 matches. Port Vale had hoped to convert the loan to a permanent deal, and according to club chairman Norman Smurthwaite, had agreed a fee with Birmingham but were unable to agree terms with the player's agent."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Brown played eight d\u00e9butantes at Crawley Town on 5 August, and it was two of these, Kay and Tonge, who scored the opening goals of a 3\u20131 victory, finished off with a first league goal for Dan Turner.

Adebayo Akinfenwa put Wycombe Wanderers ahead within two minutes of the opening home game of the season at Vale Park on 12 August, and by the 25-minute mark he had scored the opposition's final goal of a 3\u20132 defeat for the \"Valiants\". In the week following the defeat to Wycombe, both Anton Forrester and Danny Pugh were ruled out of action for three to four months, and Brown signed 20-year old Sheffield Wednesday winger Jack Stobbs on a season-long loan. The match at Chesterfield was declared \"Ernie Moss Day\" in tribute to the legend of both clubs, but another poor performance saw Vale slip to a 2\u20130 defeat to a side that had previously failed to pick up a point. Fans booed the team and turned on the manager, chanting 'You don't know what you're doing'. In the week building up to the local derby with Crewe Alexandra, Brown signed highly rated midfielder David Worrall. Worrall made his debut against Crewe, but it was midfield partner Michael Tonge who made the headlines for the wrong reasons, as he was sent off four minutes after Crewe's Chris Dagnall scored the only goal of the game on the half-hour mark; Brown said that Tonge was unlucky to be sent off and he was proud of his team's performance. On the final day before the summer transfer window closed, Brown signed Burnley centre-back Tom Anderson on a season-long loan and Doncaster Rovers central midfielder Harry Middleton on a free transfer.", "Going into November, Aspin signed 20-year box-to-box midfielder Chris Regis, who had previously entered non-league football after spending time on the books at Arsenal, Southampton and Colchester United. Vale then travelled to Newport County, and returned home with a point after coming back from 1\u20130 down, Anton Forrester scoring with his first league appearance of the campaign. Fellow relegation battlers Barnet arrived in Burslem on 18 November, and Vale claimed a hard-fought victory after Pope converted a late penalty won by Gibbons. This was Port Vale's first penalty since 20 January. However three days later the Vale fell to a 4\u20130 defeat at home to Mansfield Town, though Aspin said his team worked hard and the scoreline was not a fair reflection on the game. They then suffered a 3\u20131 defeat away to Lincoln City, having looked second best to the National League champions for most of the match; Aspin said the performance was not good enough. Also in November, long-serving full-back Adam Yates returned from a loan spell at Macclesfield Town only to suffer extensive facial injuries in a collision with Hornby in a reserve team match; despite his injury and in light of his service to the club, Yates was given a contract extension to keep him on until the end of the season.
