When this proved unsuccessful, he bought the Advertiser and made himself editor of the now-merged papers. Using the paper as a platform, he was elected for West Geelong in 1869. In 1877, he switched to Geelong, which he represented until 1886, and served as Victorian Premier in 1875, 1877\u20131880, and 1880\u20131881.

Due to a number of voters being disenfranchised by a shortage of voting papers, he used his maiden speech to announce his resignation; he lost the subsequent by-election by 15 votes, narrowly lost the seat in the February 1880 general election, but won it in yet another early general election in July 1880. The radical Premier, Graham Berry, offered him the position of Attorney-General in August, but Deakin turned him down."]}, {"page": "The Age", "response": ["Under Syme's control The Age exercised enormous political power in Victoria. It supported liberal politicians such as Graham Berry, George Higinbotham and George Turner, and other leading liberals such as Alfred Deakin and Charles Pearson furthered their careers as The Age journalists. Syme was originally a free trader, but converted to protectionism through his belief that Victoria needed to develop its manufacturing industries behind tariff barriers. During the 1890s The Age was a leading supporter of Australian federation and of the White Australia policy."]}, {"page": "George Bowen", "response": ["In January 1878, backed by advice from the Colonial Office, Bowen consented to premier Graham Berry's plan to break the deadlock by the wholesale dismissal of public servants on so-called \"Black Wednesday\". In May that year, Bowen said that \"my reluctant consent, purely on constitutional grounds, to these dismissals ... has damaged my further reputation and my career to a degree that I shall never recover. It will never be forgotten either in England or in the Colony\". However several others, including Hugh Childers and William Ewart Gladstone, approved of Bowen's actions, and he was appointed to subsequent vice-regal posts."]}, {"page": "Kensington High Street", "response": ["* Sir Graham Berry, Premier of Victoria, Australia"]}, {"page": "David Gaunson", "response": ["After fighting two unsuccessful contests in 1871, and in 1872 unsuccessfully opposing the Hon. J. G. Francis, the then premier, at Richmond, Gaunson was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1875 for Ararat, which constituency he continued to represent until July 1881. Gaunson was a prominent member of the \"Stonewall\" party led by Graham Berry, which, after unparalleled agitation in Parliament and in the country, ultimately annihilated the followers of Sir James McCulloch at the general election in 1877. Subsequently, however, Gaunson acted in opposition to Berry, and also opposed the Service Government formed in 1880."]}, {"page": "South Yarra, Victoria", "response": ["* Graham Berry - Colonial politician, and 11th Premier of Victoria; general storekeeper in South Yarra in the 1850s."]}, {"page": "Prahran, Victoria", "response": ["* Graham Berry \u2013 (1822\u20131904) Colonial politician, and 11th Premier of Victoria, was a grocer in Prahran in the 1850s.Making their mark \u2013 Susan Priestley"]}, {"page": "Charles Gavan Duffy", "response": ["An Irish Catholic Premier was very unpopular with the Protestant majority in the colony, and Duffy was accused of favouring Catholics in government appointments, an example being the appointment of John Cashel Hoey, who had been his successor as editor of The Nation, to a position in London. In June 1872 his government was defeated in the Assembly on a confidence motion allegedly motivated by sectarianism.

He was afraid that his health would not stand the strain but accepted nomination for the difficult seat of Boroondara and was narrowly defeated. In May 1877, the Graham Berry government commissioned him to inquire into the state of education in the colony and the means of improving it. The report for which he received a fee of \u00a31000 was completed in 1878. It was a valuable document, especially as he was the first to advocate the establishing of high schools to make a ladder for able children from the primary schools to university. This found little favour at the time, and more than 30 years passed before that part of his scheme was fully developed. Another valuable part of the report dealt with technical education and foreshadowed the many technical schools since established in the state of Victoria."]}, {"page": "William Wardell", "response": ["In 1877 Sir Graham Berry became the premier of Victoria. His mission, considered radically left wing at the time, was to redistribute the grazing land of Victoria, and to introduce a bill providing for the payment of members of the Legislative Assembly, which would enable working-class candidates to be elected. When his aims were rejected by the Legislative Council, he embarked on a public campaign of \"coercion\". \"We coerce madmen,\" he said, \"we put them into lunatic asylums, and never was anything more the act of madmen than the rejection of the Appropriation Bill.\" On 8 January 1878, known afterwards as \"Black Wednesday\", his \"coercing\" began. Using the reasoning that without his bill civil servants could not be paid, Berry began to dismiss public servants, starting with police and judges. Wardell's was one of the many heads which fell - dismissed from office, he left Melbourne to seek employment in Sydney."]}, {"page": "Ned Kelly (2003 film)", "response": ["* Charles Tingwell as Premier Graham Berry"]}, {"page": "John Quick (politician)", "response": ["In 1880 Quick was elected the Member for Sandhurst (Bendigo) in the Victorian Legislative Assembly.
