Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952,McCartney, p. 12. but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953,McCartney, p. 25. but others contend that it took place a year earlier. Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach Bert Whalley, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract.McCartney, p. 13. Wolves manager Stan Cullis was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he had always wanted to play for the Lancashire team.Meek, p. 100. To guard against the possibility that he might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a carpenter.McCartney, p. 16."]}, {"page": "Bill Foulkes", "response": ["Duncan Edwards died 15 days later as a result of his injuries.
