He is best known for the detailed surrealistic cover art he created for a number of British bands.Wilkinson's breakthrough came through his association with the neo-progressive rock band Marillion in the 1980s. He went on to design art for the subsequent solo career of their lead singer, Fish, as well as bands such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Though versed in a number of techniques, he is considered to be a master of the airbrush.\nIn 2012, his sleeve for the 1984 Marillion album Fugazi was chosen by Gigwise as the 29th greatest album artwork of all time. In 2015, Wilkinson designed the artwork for the Tya Brewery in \u00d8vre \u00c5rdal, Norway.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marillion", "response": ["Much of the band's enduring and unfashionable reputation stems from their emergence in the early 1980s as the most commercially successful band of the neo-progressive rock movement, an unexpected revival of the progressive rock musical style that had fallen out of critical favour in the mid-1970s. Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of Peter Gabriel-era Genesis due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and Mellotron-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by Mark Wilkinson used for the sleeves of their albums and singles.  Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint."]}, {"page": "Iron Maiden", "response": ["The touring setting was (once again) one of the best in the career of the six-person line-up to date. Referring to the title and the leading topic of the album, the stage set reflected the architectural solutions characteristic of the ancient Maya religious buildings. The group's mascot, Eddie the Head, appeared in a movable version, as the Mayan shaman, during the concert presentation of the title track from the album and as its big version during the presentation of \"Iron Maiden\" composition. This one was presenting by a huge (ten meters), inflatable and exploding bust known from the album's cover painted by Mark Wilkinson. The band used an extensive pyrotechnics, lasers, movable lighting rig based on a dozen of pillars. The construction was built on a pyramid plan, with a circular, movable target placed in the central point, around which multicolored LED floodlights were mounted, giving the effect of light reflecting on the audience."]}, {"page": "Judge Anderson", "response": ["** \u201cVoyage of the Seeker\", written by Alan Grant, art by Mark Wilkinson, on back of poster, free gift with Judge Dredd Megazine (vol. 2) #37 (1993)", "** \"Voyage of the Seeker\", written by Alan Grant, art by Mark Wilkinson, on back of poster, free gift with Judge Dredd Megazine 2.37 (1993)"]}, {"page": "Fugazi (album)", "response": ["In 2012, Gigwise chose the sleeve design by Mark Wilkinson as 29th in its countdown of the \"Greatest Album Artwork of All Time\".

At the same time, the cover contained some references to the past: It used the band's original logo, which had been replaced with a \"modernised\" version on the previous album Clutching at Straws and related releases as well as on B'Sides Themselves (although the 1988 live retrospective The Thieving Magpie also used it).

By the time this compilation was released, both line-ups had recorded four studio albums each. The second best-of since the 14-track one-disc compilation A Singles Collection (known as Six of One, Half a Dozen of the Other in the US) from 1992, this one additionally contains material from Brave (1994) and Afraid of Sunlight (1996). Two different covers were created for the compilation, one by Mark Wilkinson, who had worked for the band during the Fish years, and one by Bill Smith Studio, who took over after Fish's and Wilkinson's departure. The booklet was printed so that either of the covers could be displayed in the jewel case according to personal preference. The track list, comprising 29 songs, was put together by Lucy Jordache, then the manager responsible for the band in EMI, in close collaboration with the band's fans' mailing list, \"Freaks\" (named after the eponymous song). Jordache also motivated singers Fish and Hogarth to contribute liner notes\u2014at a time when both camps were not yet on friendly terms again\u2014by telling each of them the other had already agreed to do so.Big George Webley, \"Marillion: Doing Business With Their Fans\", Sound on Sound, September 2003, retrieved 8 August 2013."]}, {"page": "Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors", "response": ["The cover art was by Mark Wilkinson, who had illustrated all Marillion albums and singles while Fish was their singer and went on to design almost all Fish solo covers.
