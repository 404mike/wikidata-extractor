At St Andrews church, Holborn, London on 20 March 1788 he married Mary Maberly (1768\u20131822), daughter of prosperous manufacturer Stephen Maberly and sister of John Maberly. They had 15 children, of which Apsley Pellatt was the eldest son. Pellatt lived at The Friars, Lewes, and ran his business at St Paul's Churchyard, London.Sometime around 1790 he bought the Falcon Glass House in Blackfriars, London which had been making glass since 1693. In 1807  he took out a patent for the manufacture of lights (round lens-shaped windows like portholes) to allow natural light to illuminate the interiors of dark rooms, especially the holds of ships.\nHis eldest son Apsley joined the business in 1811 and took it over completely on Apsley Snr's death in 1826, renaming it Apsley Pellatt & Co. A younger son, Frederic, also joined the company in due course. Apsley Snr was buried with his wife in the Cribbe family vault in Bunhill Fields, London.\nPellatt's third son, Mill Pellatt (1795\u20131863), was grandfather of the Canadian financier Sir Henry Pellatt.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Smithson", "response": ["His first paper was presented at the Royal Society on 7 July 1791, \"An Account of Some Chemical Experiments on Tabasheer\". Tabasheer is a substance used in traditional Indian medicine and derived from material collected inside bamboo culms. The samples that Macie analysed had been sent by Patrick Russell, physician-naturalist in India. In 1802 he read his second paper, \"A Chemical Analysis of Some Calamines,\" at the Royal Society. It was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London and was the documented instance of his new name, James Smithson. In the paper, Smithson challenges the idea that the mineral calamine is an oxide of zinc. His discoveries made calamine a \"true mineral\". He explored and examined Kirkdale Cave; his findings, published in 1824, successfully challenged previous beliefs that the fossils within the formations at the cave were from the Great Flood. Smithson is credited with first using the word \"silicates\". Smithson's bank records at C. Hoare & Co show extensive and regular income derived from Apsley Pellatt, which suggests that Smithson had a strong financial or scientific relationship with the Blackfriars glass maker."]}, {"page": "Thomas Love Peacock", "response": ["Peacock was born in Weymouth, Dorset, the son of Samuel Peacock and his wife Sarah Love, daughter of Thomas Love, a retired master of a man-of-war in the Royal Navy.
