Her debut album, Janet Jackson, was released in 1982. It was produced by Angela Winbush, Ren\u00e9 Moore, Bobby Watson of Rufus and Leon Sylvers III, and overseen by her father Joseph. It peaked at No. 63 on the Billboard 200, and No. 6 on the publication's R&B albums chart, receiving little promotion. The album appeared on the Billboard Top Black Albums of 1983, while Jackson herself was the highest-ranking female vocalist on the Billboard Year-End Black Album Artists.", "===1989\u20131992: Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814===", "She also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of her impact on the recording industry and philanthropic endeavors. The massive success experienced by Jackson placed her in league with her brother Michael, Madonna, and Tina Turner for her achievements and influence. Ebony magazine remarked: \"No individual or group has impacted the world of entertainment as have Michael and Janet Jackson,\" arguing that despite many imitators, few could surpass Jackson's \"stunning style and dexterity\".", "The album experimented with a diverse number of genres, including contemporary R&B, deep house, swing jazz, hip hop, rock, and pop, with Billboard describing each as being \"delivered with consummate skill and passion\". Jackson took a larger role in songwriting and production than she did on her previous albums, explaining she found it necessary \"to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies\" while also speaking candidly about incorporating her sexuality into the album's content. Rolling Stone wrote \"[a]s princess of America's black royal family, everything Janet Jackson does is important. Whether proclaiming herself in charge of her life, as she did on Control (1986), or commander in chief of a rhythm army dancing to fight society's problems (Rhythm Nation 1814, from 1989), she's influential. And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, Janet., it's a cultural moment.\"", "Jackson's influence in pop music continued to garner acclaim, as The Boston Globe remarked \"If you're talking about the female power elite in pop, you can't get much higher than Janet Jackson, Bonnie Raitt, Madonna and Yoko Ono. Their collective influence\u00a0... is beyond measure. And who could dispute that Janet Jackson now has more credibility than brother Michael?\"", "In July 2000, Jackson appeared in her second film, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, as the role of Professor Denise Gaines, opposite Eddie Murphy. Director Peter Segal stated \"Janet Jackson was a natural fit, and an obvious choice.\" The film became her second to open at number one, grossing an estimated $170 million worldwide. Jackson's single \"Doesn't Really Matter\", used for the film's soundtrack, became her ninth number-one single on the Hot 100.", "To promote the album, Jackson appeared in various magazines, and performed on the Today Show and Billboard Awards. Jackson's Us Weekly cover, revealing her slim figure after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine's best-selling issue in history.The best-selling issue in Us Weekly history was the Janet Jackson mag, which sold a record 1.4 million the week of May 26.  20 Y.O. was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the Billboard\u00a0200. The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri. Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying \"If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison.\"", "Later that month, Jackson chaired the inaugural benefit of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, held in Milan in conjunction with fashion week. The foundation's CEO stated \"We are profoundly grateful to Janet Jackson for joining amfAR as a chair of its first event in Milan... She brings incomparable grace and a history of dedication to the fight against AIDS.\" The event raised $1.1 million for the nonprofit organization.", "In April 2010, Jackson reprised her role in the sequel to Why Did I Get Married? titled Why Did I Get Married Too?. The film opened at number two, grossing sixty million. Jackson's performance was hailed as \"invigorating and oddly funny\", and praised for her \"willingness to be seen at her most disheveled\".

She partnered with the label to release a fifteen-piece collection of luxury products.", "BET presented Jackson with their inaugural Ultimate Icon: Music Dance Visual award at the BET Awards 2015, which also featured a dance tribute to her performed by Ciara, Jason Derulo and Tinashe. It was announced she would launch a luxury jewelry line called the \"Janet Jackson Unbreakable Diamonds collection,\" a joint venture between herself and Paul Raps New York. On August 20, she released a preview of a new song \"The Great Forever,\" while also confirming the title of her eleventh studio album as Unbreakable.", "On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Janet Jackson among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire.", "Several critics also consider her voice to often be enveloped within her music's production. Wendy Robinson of PopMatters said \"the power of Janet Jackson's voice does not lie in her pipes. She doesn't blow, she whispers\u00a0... Jackson's confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms, so she's never unpleasant to listen to.\"", "On Control, Richard J. Ripani documented that she, Jam and Lewis had \"crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.\" Author Rickey Vincent stated that she has often been credited for redefining the standard of popular music with the industrial-strength beats of the album. She is considered a trendsetter in pop balladry, with Richard Rischar stating \"the black pop ballad of the mid-1980s had been dominated by the vocal and production style that was smooth and polished, led by singers Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and James Ingram.\"", "Jackson has changed her lyrical focus over the years, becoming the subject of analysis in musicology, African American studies, and gender studies. David Ritz compared Jackson's musical style to Marvin Gaye's, stating, \"like Marvin, autobiography seemed the sole source of her music. Her art, also like Marvin's, floated over a reservoir of secret pain.\" Much of her success has been attributed to \"a series of powerful, metallic grooves; her chirpy, multi-tracked vocals; and a lyrical philosophy built on pride and self-knowledge.\" Ritz also stated, \"The mystery is the low flame that burns around the perimeters of Janet Jackson's soul. The flame feeds off the most highly combustible elements: survival and ambition, caution and creativity, supreme confidence and dark fear.\"", "Jackson drew inspiration for her music videos and performances from musicals she watched in her youth, and was heavily influenced by the choreography of Fred Astaire and Michael Kidd, among others. Throughout her career, she has worked with and brought numerous professional choreographers to prominence, such as Tina Landon, Paula Abdul, and Michael Kidd. Veronica Chambers declared, \"Her impact on pop music is undeniable and far-reaching,\" adding, \"A quick glance at the Billboard chart reveals any number of artists cast in the Janet Jackson mold.\" Chambers observed numerous videos which \"features not only Ms. Jackson's dancers, but choreography and sets remarkably like those she has used.\"", "Her \"Number Ones: Up Close and Personal\" tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \"In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production\u00a0... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a passion that wasn't always evident in stadiums\u00a0... the best Janet Jackson performance I've covered in 20-plus years.\"", "Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News reported Jackson often lip syncs in concert; he wrote: \"Janet Jackson\u2014one of pop's most notorious onstage lip-syncers\u2014conceded\u00a0... she uses 'some' taped vocals to augment her live vocals. But she refused to say what percentage of her concert 'voice' is taped and how much is live.\" Michael MacCambridge of the Austin American-Statesman, who reviewed Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour, described lip-syncing as a \"moot point\", stating \"Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles.\" MacCambridge also observed \"it seemed unlikely that anyone\u2014even a prized member of the First Family of Soul Music\u2014could dance like she did for 90 minutes and still provide the sort of powerful vocals that the '90s super concerts are expected to achieve.\"", "The youngest sister of the \"precious Jackson clan\", Janet Jackson has striven to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael and the rest of the Jackson family. Steve Dollar of Newsday wrote that \"[s]he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys.\" Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. Joshua Klein wrote, \"[f]or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'.\"", "Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a \"superstar\" in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while \"successfully [shifting] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult\". By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the \"Queen of Pop\".She confirmed her status as today's Queen of Pop when, not long ago, she signed a $35\u2013$40 million recording contract with Virgin Records. Janet Jackson is a big deal these days, the Queen of Pop, though we can still call her by her first name. So little is she trading off the fame of her brother, so completely has she become her own thing, she has all but abandoned the family name. Tour posters, tickets and recent album\u00a0\u2014 all say, quite simply \"Janet\", and leave it at that.  Klein argued that \"stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet\u2014Miss Jackson, if you're nasty\u2014would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.\".", "Jackson has also been recognized for playing a pivotal role in crossing racial boundaries in the recording industry, where black artists were once considered to be substandard.Over the next few years, a significant proportion of music industry revenues were generated by a handful of superstar artists; in addition to her brother Michael, there were Lionel Richie, Madonna, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Wham!, Phil Collins, Steve Winwood, Huey Lewis and the News, the Pointer Sisters, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker, and a handful of others. A surprising number of the new superstars were black. This was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music.  Author Maureen Mahon states: \"In the 1980s, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Prince were among the African American artists who crossed over\u00a0... When black artists cross over into pop success they cease to be black in the industry sense of the word. They get promoted from racialized black music to universal pop music in an economically driven process of racial transcendence.\" The Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge documented that Jackson, along with other prominent African-American women, had achieved financial breakthroughs in mainstream popular music, receiving \"superstar status\" in the process.", "Musicologist Richard J. Ripani identified Jackson as a leader in the development of contemporary R&B, as her music created a unique blend of genre and sound effects which ushered in the use of rap vocals into mainstream R&B. He also argues her signature song \"Nasty\" influenced the new jack swing genre developed by Teddy Riley. Leon McDermott of the Sunday Herald wrote: \"Her million-selling albums in the 1980s helped invent contemporary R&B through Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's muscular, lean production; the sinuous grooves threaded through 1986's Control and 1989's Rhythm Nation 1814 are the foundation upon which today's hotshot producers and singers rely.\" On March 24, 2021, the Library of Congress announced that Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 had been added to the National Recording Registry's class of 2020, stating that the album still \"resonates today\".", "In March 2008, Business Wire reported \"Janet Jackson is one of the top ten selling artists in the history of contemporary music; ranked by Billboard magazine as the ninth most successful act in rock and roll history, and the second most successful female artist in pop music history.\" She is the only artist in the history of the Hot 100 to have 18 consecutive top ten hit singles, from \"Miss You Much\" (1989) to \"I Get Lonely\" (1998). The magazine ranked her at number seven on their Hot 100 50th Anniversary \"All-Time Top Artists\", making her the third most successful female artist in the history of the chart, following Madonna and Mariah Carey.", "Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote: \"Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by\u2014and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped\u2014the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style.\" Adrienne Trier-Bieniek stated, \"scholars trace the origins of pleasure as a Black feminist commitment within popular culture to Janet Jackson\" who inspired the feminist perspective found in many pop stars' careers. Those who are considered to have followed in her footsteps have been referred to as \"Janet-come-lately's\".While her vocal skills are at least as decent as Britney Spears and the other Janet-come-latelys, it's Jackson's skills as an entertainer\u2014and commanding stage presence\u2014that makes her so deserving of the spotlight. Most disappointing was crunk princess Ciara. The Janet-come-lately and her octet of dance-floor acrobats moved with ferocious elegance to tracks like 'Goodies,' but the singer had glaring microphone problems when she spoke\u2014tediously, about the 'importance' of her upcoming sophomore album. ", "At age 18, Janet Jackson eloped with singer James DeBarge in September 1984. The marriage was annulled in November 1985. On March 31, 1991, Jackson married dancer/songwriter/director Ren\u00e9 Elizondo Jr. The marriage was kept a secret until the split was announced. In January 1999, the couple separated and were divorced in 2000. Elizondo filed a lawsuit against her, estimated to have been between $10\u201325\u00a0million, which did not reach a settlement for three years.", "* Janet Jackson (1982)", "* Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989)", "* Janet Jackson: A Special 30th Anniversary Celebration of Rhythm Nation (2019)", "* Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis (2019)"]}, {"page": "The Womens Amateur Championship", "response": ["|1921 || Turnberry ||  Cecil Leitch ||align=\"center\"|4 & 3 ||  Joyce Wethered ||  Janet Jackson,  Lena Scroggie || ", "|1920 || Royal County Down ||  Cecil Leitch ||align=\"center\"|7 & 6 ||  Molly Griffiths ||  Doris Fraser,  Janet Jackson || ", "|1913 || Lytham & St Annes ||  Muriel Dodd ||align=\"center\"|8 & 6 ||  Evelyn Chubb ||  Janet Jackson,  Violet Pooley || "]}, {"page": "May Hezlet", "response": ["In 1899, at the golf course in Newcastle, County Down, May Hezlet defeated Rhona Adair to win the first of her five Irish Ladies' Close Championships, three of which came in succession from 1904 to 1906.
