Lonely, unloved by a stuck-up and pretentious father and older sister, little considered by a family circle incapable of recognising her value, she leads a dull life of an almost-old maid. And yet here it is that, 7/8 years after the naval war with France ended, in September 1814, the young man whom she has never forgotten returns to England, having earned epaulettes, prestige and fortune in the navy. The first contacts are painful. He has retained an image of her as a person too easily influenced and she sees clearly that he is still angry with her. But at age 26/27, she has matured and gained enough independence from her family and social circle to choose her friends and her future.\nThe posthumous novel by Jane Austen presents the portrait of an independent spirit, a young, intelligent and melancholic woman, sensitive and attentive to others, who regains her self-confidence when she is given a second chance to find happiness, a very different happiness from other Austenian heroines, since she marries neither a land owner nor a clergyman, but a ship's captain. She would be \"proud of being the wife of a sailor\" but she would also know its anxieties and its sorrows. She is considered the most lucid and responsible Austenian heroine and the reader is privy in a special way to her thoughts, which are of an exactitude and a perceptiveness unparalleled in the heroines of previous novels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Persuasion (novel)", "response": ["The story concerns Anne Elliot, a young Englishwoman of twenty-seven years, whose family moves to lower their expenses and reduce their debt by renting their home to an Admiral and his wife. The wife's brother, Navy Captain Frederick Wentworth, was engaged to Anne in 1806, but the engagement was broken when Anne was \"persuaded\" by her friends and family to end their relationship. Anne and Captain Wentworth, both single and unattached, meet again after a seven-year separation, setting the scene for many humorous encounters as well as a second, well-considered chance at love and marriage for Anne in her second \"bloom\".", "The novel was well-received in the early 19th century, but its greater fame came later in the century and continued into the 20th and 21st centuries. Much scholarly debate on Austen's work has since been published. Anne Elliot is noteworthy among Austen's heroines for her relative maturity. As Persuasion was Austen's last completed work, it is accepted as her most maturely written novel, showing a refinement of literary conception indicative of a woman approaching forty years of age. Her use of free indirect discourse in narrative was in full evidence by 1816.", "The story begins seven years after the broken engagement of Anne Elliot to Frederick Wentworth: Having just turned nineteen years old, Anne fell in love and had accepted a proposal of marriage from Wentworth, then a young and undistinguished naval officer. Wentworth was considered clever, confident and ambitious, but his low social status made Anne's friends and family view him as an unsuitable partner. Anne's father, Sir Walter Elliot, and her older sister, Elizabeth, maintained that Wentworth was no match for a woman of Kellynch Hall, the family estate. Furthermore, Lady Russell, a distant relative whom Anne considers to be a second mother to her after her own died, also saw the relationship as imprudent for one so young and persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Lady Russell are the only family members who knew about the short engagement, as Anne's younger sister Mary was away at school.", "Anne Elliot \u2013 The second daughter of Sir Walter. Anne is intelligent, accomplished and attractive, and she is unmarried at 27, having broken off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth, then a naval commander, seven years earlier. Anne fell in love with Wentworth but was persuaded by her mentor, Lady Russell, to reject his proposal because of his poverty, uncertain future, and Anne's youth. Anne rejects Charles Musgrove's proposal a few years later, knowing she still loves Wentworth, but it is only when Wentworth returns from fighting abroad that she finally confronts her unfulfilled feelings for him.", "Mrs Smith \u2013 A friend of Anne Elliot who lives in Bath. Mrs Smith is a widow who suffers ill health and financial difficulties. She keeps abreast of the doings of Bath society through news she gets from her nurse, Rooke, who tends the wife of a friend of William Elliot's. Her financial problems could have been straightened out with assistance from William Elliot, her husband's friend and executor of his will, but Elliot's greed led him to hide most of her remaining fortune with the expectation that he would eventually be able to take it for himself. Wentworth eventually acts on her behalf when William departs Bath, allowing Mrs Smith to claim her money.", "In his essay titled \"Persuasion: forms of estrangement,\" A Walton Litz gives a concise summary of the various issues critics have raised with Persuasion as a novel.Persuasion has received highly intelligent criticism in recent years, after a long period of comparative neglect, and the lines of investigation have followed Virginia Woolf's suggestive comments. Critics have been concerned with the \"personal\" quality of the novel and the problems it poses for biographical interpretation; with the obvious unevenness in narrative structure; with the \"poetic\" use of landscape, and the hovering influence of Romantic poetry; with the pervasive presence of Anne Elliot's consciousness; with new effects in style and syntax; with the \"modernity\" of Anne Elliot, an isolated personality in a rapidly changing society.Susan Morgan  in her 1980 book on Austen, challenges Litz on naming Persuasion as a novel showing Austen's assimilation of the new romantic poetry as this raises difficulties. Morgan notes Litz's comment on \"the deeply physical impact of Persuasion\"; he remarks that \"Mansfield Park is about the loss and return of principles, Emma about the loss and return of reason, Persuasion about the loss and return of 'bloom'.\" Litz acknowledges the crudeness of these formulations and we recognize that he is attempting to discuss a quality of the novel which is hard to describe. But such summaries, even tentatively offered, only distort. The few brief nature scenes in Persuasion (and they are brief out of all proportion to the commentary on them), the walk to Winthrop and the environs of Pinny and Lyme, are certainly described with sensibility and appreciation. And in Anne's mind they are just as certainly bound up with 'the sweets of poetical despondence'.\"", "The literary scholar Stuart Tave, in his essay concerning Persuasion's main character Anne Elliot, notes the melancholy qualities of Anne's reality in her world after she turns away the original proposal of marriage from Captain Wentworth. For Tave, Austen portrays Anne as a character with many admirable traits, usually exceeding the quality of these traits as they are found in the other characters which surround her. Tave singles out Austen's portrayal of Anne at the end of the novel in her conversation with Captain Harville where the two of them discuss the relative virtues of gender and their advantages compared to one another; Tave sees Anne as depicting a remarkable intelligence. Tave quotes from Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own where Woolf states, \"It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until Jane Austen's day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex.\" Tave applies Woolf's insight to Persuasion when he continues: \"All histories are against you, Captain Harville says to Anne in their disagreement about man's nature and woman's nature, 'all stories, prose and verse.' He could bring fifty quotations in a moment to his side of the argument, from books, songs, proverbs. But they were all written by men. 'Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story,' as Anne says. Persuasion is the story told by a woman.\"", "The coolness to the reader (conveyed by Austen's narrative) contrasts with an intensity of feeling for the characters in the story, particularly for the heroine. The reason for this contradiction is that Anne Elliot is the central intelligence of the novel. Sir Walter is seen as Anne sees him, with resigned contempt. For the first time Jane Austen gives over the narrator's authority to a character almost completely, In Emma, many events and situations are seen from Emma's point of view, but the central intelligence lies somewhere between the narrator and the reader, who together see that Emma sees wrongly. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot's feelings and evaluations correspond to those of the narrator in almost every situation, although there are several significant lapses...It seems that this transfer of authority placed a strain on Jane Austen's accustomed narrative tendencies and that she could not maintain it completely.", "*2019: Rational Creatures, a modernization of Persuasion, with Kristina Pupo as Ana El\u00edas (Anne Elliot) and Peter Giessl as Fred Wentworth (Captain Wentworth)."]}, {"page": "Amanda Root", "response": ["In 1995, she starred as Anne Elliot in Persuasion, co-starring Ciar\u00e1n Hinds and John Woodvine.

According to Root, \"every actress in England\" read for the part. Having worked with the director previously on the 1993 TV serial The Buddha of Suburbia, Root won the role by writing him a letter to gain an audition. The character was described to Root as \"haggard\", which attracted the actress. \"I relish a job like this, starting off downtrodden and gradually blossoming\", she said. WGBH Boston, the American company co-producing the film, had wanted a better-known actress for the part but agreed to Root's casting after seeing Root's screen test.", "Michell attempted to be as faithful to the novel as possible, in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th century. The director explained, \"I was desperately trying to make it feel like it could be happening in the next room. I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet\". Consequently, because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic, Michell chose to depict the actors without make-up and stopped them looking too hygienic. Root commented about the film's natural look in an interview, \"I basically didn't wear any makeup [in the film], and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh, as well. None of us looked good\". She said in a separate interview, \"I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow, and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time\". Root believed the film's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal.", "In a contribution for The Washington Post, Desson Howe said \"there's a wonderful, unhurried delicacy about Persuasion...as if everyone concerned with the production knows that, if given time and patience, Austen's genius will emerge. Thanks to assured performances, exacting direction and, of course, inspired writing, it does, in subtle, glorious ways\". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker graded the film with an \"A\u2013\", saying it \"should enthrall even those who haven't read\" the novel. Tucker concluded that the film was \"the sort of passionate yet precise comedy that reminds me why Austen remains such a vital writer\". Susan Ostrov Weisser, a professor of nineteenth-century literature, called the film a \"faithful parade of Austen's world\", and praised Root as the film's \"crown jewel\" for playing a \"fiercely intelligent, regretful, and frustrated Anne Elliot with subtlety and nuance\".

You have to find ways to show the feelings straining beneath the surface.\" The actor added that he enjoyed playing Wentworth \"because, beyond his social grace and charm, there's a bitterness and sadness because the love of his life, Anne Elliot, rejected him.\" Five days later, it was announced that Julia Davis and Anthony Head would be appearing as Elizabeth Elliot and Sir Walter Elliot respectively.", "The costume designer for Persuasion was Andrea Galer. Galer made Anne's outfits simple and basic because she does not join in Bath society. The designer explained \"I wanted her to look in tune with nature. Because we were shooting in winter, I could go for faded autumnal colours for her. She gets Wentworth back just by her stillness and I wanted to reflect that in her wardrobe.\" Galer designed a jacket for Hawkins to wear as Anne using a 19th-century shawl, which she mounted and patched together with a cross stitch. She used hand loom fabric from India and the Sri Lanakan crafted Beeralu lace to decorate some of the garments. In 2008, costumes from Persuasion went on display at the Jane Austen Centre in Bath. The exhibition included creations worn by Anne, Lady Russell and the Musgrove sisters. Four years later, many of the costumes from Persuasion and Miss Austen Regrets were sold in an online auction organised by the Jane Austen Centre. Galer admitted that while it was difficult to part with them, it was time to move on and she hoped they had been bought because of their association with the Austen films.

A recurring image in Austen films is that of women gazing through a window to the outside world, or walking in the countryside.Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 page 150 The critic Julianne Pidduck in her essay \"Of Windows and Country Walks\" argues the former image symbolizes repression and a woman's lot in Regency England, being trapped in a patriarchal society, while the latter image symbolises freedom.Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 page 150. The critic Mary Favret, in her 2000 essay \"Being True to Jane Austen,\" argued that because film is literally just moving pictures, it resists the tendency of photography to have a fixed image, suggesting a world where change is always possible. Because of this, Favret praised the 1995 version of Persuasion as the film used a wandering camera to capture in a kaleidoscopic way Anne Elliot's unexpressed romantic-sexual feelings even when Anne (Amanda Root) remained still and silent. Irvine noted that film adaptations of Austen's work often used the physicality of the actors to show the sexual desires of the characters that Austen herself only hinted at, with Irving calling a \"particularly notorious\" example of this being the scene from the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice, where Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) dives into a pond and emerges with wet clothes clinging to his body before a clearly interested Miss Bennet (Jennifer Ehle).", "!Anne Elliot"]}, {"page": "Persuasion (1971 TV series)", "response": ["Persuasion is a 1971 British television serial adaptation of the 1817 Jane Austen novel of the same name.

Margaret Kirkham has argued that Austen is part of this tradition because, for one, her \"heroines do not adore or worship their husbands, though they respect and love them. They are not, especially in the later novels, allowed to get married at all until the heroes have provided convincing evidence of appreciating their qualities of mind, and of accepting their power of rational judgement, as well as their good hearts.\"Kirkham, 31; see also Johnson, 153. Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is an example of such a protagonist.Johnson, 146. Kirkham argues that Austen knew and admired the works of Mary Wollstonecraft, particularly A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).Kirkham, 34. Moreover, she and others argue that Austen's novels followed in the tradition of the radical Jacobin novels of the 1790s, which often dealt with feminist issues.See, for example, Johnson, chapter 1.", "Despite arguing that Austen's novels have feminist elements, scholars have still noted that women are frequently represented as confined in Austen's novels and that there are few depictions of female authority figures.

Gilbert and Gubar argue that women \"must acquiesce in their own confinement, no matter how stifling\" because \"they are too vulnerable in the world at large\".Gilbert and Gubar, 108. For example, in Persuasion Anne Elliot describes the differences between men and women: \"We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\"Johnson, 160. Butler points out that Austen's novels lack depictions of female mentors or authority figures. In the novels, Butler argues, women do not progress from ignorance to knowledge, for example, and many of them are \"oddly and even unnaturally ineffective\". Instead, they marry authority figures.Butler, xl\u2013xli.
