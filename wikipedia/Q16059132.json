From Bromborough Pool, Cheshire, Williams began with the Bromborough Pool Cricket Club, and later played two seasons in the Liverpool and District league, taking \"nearly 200 wickets\". He went on to play for Cheshire in the Minor Counties Championship, debuting during the 1909 season. He began as a top-order batsman, but later often played as an opening or first-change bowler.Beginning with the 1912 season, Williams, working as a groundsman at Lord's, also turned out for the MCC in several non-first-class matches. His only match at first-class level came in May 1914, against Kent. In the match, he scored 11 not out in the MCC's first innings, which included a partnership of 39 runs for the ninth wicket with former Test player Jack Hearne. While bowling, he conceded 26 runs from his three overs, and the MCC lost by an innings and 19 runs. In the First World War, Williams served as a private in the 10th Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment. He was killed in Thiepval, France, in July 1916, as part of the ongoing Battle of the Somme. His name is inscribed on the Thiepval Memorial.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Williams", "response": ["Joseph Williams may refer to:", "* Joseph Williams (composer) (1800\u20131834), English composer", "* Joseph Williams (music publisher), London music publisher", "* Joseph Williams (musician) (born 1960), rock singer with band Toto", "* Joseph Williams (athlete) (1897\u2013?), British Olympic athlete", "* Joseph Williams (Connecticut politician) (1779\u20131865)", "* Joseph Williams (Nevisian cricketer) (born 1989)", "* Joseph Williams (English cricketer) (1892\u20131916)", "* Joseph Williams (Barbadian cricketer) (born 1974)", "* Joseph Williams (footballer) (1857\u2013?), Welsh international footballer", "* Joseph Williams (justice) (1801\u20131870), Chief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court", "* Joseph Williams (bishop) (1857\u20131934), Bishop of St John's, South Africa", "* Joseph Williams (actor), English stage actor"]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Joseph Williams"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1895\u20131914)", "response": ["* Joseph Williams (1914) : J.
