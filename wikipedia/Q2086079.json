He was born at Thame in Oxfordshire on 12 December 1813.  He initially began to collect plants in his native United Kingdom and also in France. In 1856 Ayres was appointed by Queen Victoria to superintendency of quarantine on Flat Island, Mauritius under governor Robert Townsend Farquhar. Ayres is particularly well known for his extensive plant collections made while in this position. He is also credited for finding the first sub fossil remains of the dodo in 1860. From 1856 to 1863 he traveled through Madagascar, the Seychelles, and the Mascarenes to develop this rich collection of Indian Ocean plant specimens. These specimens are now in the herbaria collections of the Natural History Museum, London, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris.  In addition to collecting, Ayres catalogued and sketched the plants in the wild, as was common among nineteenth century naturalists.  He also planned to write a book about the flora of Mauritius, but he died from relapsing fever in his home in Port Louis on 30 April 1863 before the flora could be accomplished. Ayres' wife Harriet collected his written records and bequeathed them to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.\nHis eldest son Philip Burnard Chenery Ayres (1840\u20131899) became a well-known surgeon in Hong Kong.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dodo", "response": ["Until 1860, the only known dodo remains were the four incomplete 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word that he should be informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mah\u00e9bourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. Harry Pasley Higginson, a railway engineer from Yorkshire, reports discovering the Mare aux Songes bones at the same time as Clark and there is some dispute over who found them first. Higginson sent boxes of these bones to Liverpool, Leeds and York museums. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration."]}, {"page": "Trochetia parviflora", "response": ["In the past Trochetia parviflora was known from the forest at Montagne-Ory. After botanist Philip Burnard Ayres collected the last known specimens in 1863 it was long regarded as lost until 76 individuals were rediscovered in April 2001 by the Mauritian botanists  Vincent Florens and Jean-Claude Sevathian, from the Mauritius Herbarium, on a rocky slope of the Corps de Garde six kilometres apart from the type locality. It was assumed that this species has reduced its original range due to competition with invasive alien plants and seed predation by invasive monkeys and rats. Today the biggest threats are wildfire and landslides."]}, {"page": "Philip B.
