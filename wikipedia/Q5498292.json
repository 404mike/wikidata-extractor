He was a simple, clear and easy writer; he successfully avoided the least appearance of that effort which is fatal to this kind of verse.

He wrote predominantly light verse, considered a subgenre of traditional poetry. Light verse is traditionally intended to be humorous, although humor is often a way to approach serious subjects. The use of wordplay, puns, and alliteration are common conventions, and light poetry is typically considered structured form poetry with rhyme schemes. It has been said that writing light verse successfully is the most difficult of all intellectual accomplishments in order for the poet to be taken seriously. Taylor\u2019s wit was not a savage but it often had a bite, and he possessed a keen sense of language and technical skill using rhythmical structures to frame his thought. His verse was often compared to that of Charles Stuart Calverley and William S. Gilbert. In her eulogy at Taylor\u2019s memorial service, Harriet Monroe, founder of Poetry, considered Taylor to be in the same league as British poets Frederick Locker-Lampson and Austin Dobson, and American poets Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. and Thomas Bailey Aldrich. Taylor was well read and knew the classics intimately. Horace was a major influence, and Taylor was adept in capturing the essence of his work. Taylor\u2019s love of poetry extended beyond humorous verse, however, as he also enjoyed the work of the more \u201cserious\u201d contemporary poets. In particular, he was fond of Yeats and attended his readings whenever he was in Chicago. In his book of poetry, A Penny Whistle,Bert Leston Taylor (1921) A Penny Whistle: Together with the Babette Ballads, A.A. Knopff, New York   Taylor dedicates several poems to Yeats. Taylor's poetry influenced on all levels of society.

Knopf (1927) \u2013 Originally published in 1913 by Laurentian Publishers, a group that wanted to publish books by distinctive Chicago authors. Their first title was The Beginning of Grand Opera in Chicago, by music critic Karleton Hackett. The bulk of the verses in this collection first appeared in the Line. Foreword by Ring Lardner, the American sports columnist and short-story writer. Described as a book of light verse commenting upon human follies, frailties, and foibles, but with an unfailing sympathy and greathearted tolerance \u2013 it ranges from nonsense verse of Edward Lear to the elegance of Frederick Locker-Lampson and the Fragonard-like magic of Austin Dobson. Taylor\u2019s light verse covers a multitude of whimsies, parodies, satires, and lampoons. Some of the poems are topical and satirical, but there are also a few nature poems about the woods and waters that appealed to Taylor."]}, {"page": "Age disparity in sexual relationships", "response": ["In earlier sources, the rule sometimes had a different interpretation than in contemporary times.
