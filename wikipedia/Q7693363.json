He initially studied medicine in Edinburgh before pursuing a career as a writer. He is best remembered as the writer of It's That Man Again (ITMA), a radio comedy series which ran for a decade from 1939 and was immensely successful. ITMA was devised by Kavanagh, producer Francis Worsley and the Liverpudian comedian Tommy Handley as Handley's specific vehicle; Kavanagh had been writing for him since 1924, and co-wrote two feature films for Handley, It's That Man Again (1943) and science fiction/ comedy Time Flies (1944).\nKavanagh's biography of Handley was published in 1949, the year of the comedian's death and the end of their radio show. A prolific writer, ITMA and his work for Handley constituted only a small proportion of his total oeuvre.\nIn 1948, Kavanagh set up an agency for writers, Ted Kavanagh Associated (Entertainments) Ltd. The company was dissolved in 1963.He is credited as bringing solo comedy writers Frank Muir and Denis Norden together, resulting in a successful 30-year partnership that produced Take It From Here and other series. Both writers worked for his agency.Kavanagh was invited to appear as a guest on Desert Island Discs in 1951, where he selected discs from Tommy Handley, Florence Foster Jenkins and Tod Slaughter.Ted Kavanagh married Agnes O'Keefe  at St Alphonsus' Chapel, Glasgow on the 31 March 1919. He died in London on the 17 September 1958 at the age of 66. His son was the poet P. J.

The shows featured Tommy Handley in the central role, a fast-talking figure, around whom all the other characters orbited. The programmes were written by Ted Kavanagh and produced by Francis Worsley. Handley died during the twelfth series, the remaining programmes of which were immediately cancelled: ITMA could not work without him, and no further series were commissioned.", "The comedian Tommy Handley started as a music hall comedian before becoming a regular feature on BBC radio from 1924. By the end of the 1920s he was, according to writers Andy Foster and Steve Furst, a household name in Britain; his popularity continued in to the 1930s. The writer Ted Kavanagh was a fan of Handley and wrote a script for a comedy sketch for him in 1926. Handley liked the work and bought it; it was the start of a professional relationship that lasted until Handley's death in 1949."]}, {"page": "Hattie Jacques", "response": ["In August 1947 Ted Kavanagh, the scriptwriter of the BBC Home Service show It's That Man Again (ITMA), visited the Players' and invited Jacques to audition for the series, which she did on 18 September, for a fee of five guineas.

Jacques joined the cast of ITMA as the greedy schoolgirl Sophie Tuckshop, where she \"would regale listeners with terrifying accounts of epic binges\", before finishing her stories with the catchphrase \"But I'm all right now\".
