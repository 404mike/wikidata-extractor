He was also in the team that won the FA Cup in 1906\u201307 and was once selected to play in a Football League XI. He made his final appearance for the club early in the 1909\u201310 season and later left to join Whitwell St Lawrence.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Knighton", "response": ["Knighton grew up in Derbyshire and was a footballer in his youth. His great-grandfather, Willie Layton, was part of Sheffield Wednesday's 1903 and 1904 league championship-winning teams, and also the FA Cup-winning team of 1907. As a teenager, Knighton spent a year as an apprentice at Coventry City. However, his football career was cut short due to a thigh injury. He studied at Durham University's Bede College, where he gained a degree in physical education, before returning to St Cuthbert's College, Durham, to study philosophy, politics, and Mandarin Chinese. He became a teacher in physical education and geography, and took a position at St. David's School (now Huddersfield Grammar School) in 1976. He was appointed headmaster in 1980, and bought the school in 1983. He stopped teaching in 1984 to focus on property interests."]}]}}
