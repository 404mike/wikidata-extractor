Wales captain Sam Warburton was sent off in the semi-final against France because he did not safely return a player to the floor after a tackle.  The decision was controversial with several commentators believing that it should only be a yellow card because Warburton did not drive the player into the ground.  Austin Healey was one of several current and former players who criticised the dismissal on Twitter, calling it a \"most ridiculous decision\".  However, the red card was upheld after the match and Warburton was given a three-week ban.  Warburton became only the second player to be dismissed in a semi-final, the latest stage towards the final that any player has received a red card.Standley, James.
