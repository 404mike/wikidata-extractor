Interspersed among importation of opium from the Middle and Far East countries, Britain itself produced a meager amount of opium and utilized it, at least initially, as medicine and also as an ingredient in patent medicines to treat a variety of ailments and diseases.  Given the euphoric and psychologically reinforcing properties of opium, users eventually began consuming it for recreation instead of therapeutic purposes. Its hypothesized effects on visions have been discussed in many theories, one of which was M. H. Abrams', who claims that opium opened up a creative channel, while another was Elisabeth Schneider's argument stating that opium did not inspire visions, but only a daydream-like trance, and Alethea Hayter's position that opium's influences were a combination of the previous two claims.Milligan, 4", "A recent argument put forward by Alethea Hayter suggests that opium opens up the individual's mind toward recollecting the raw materials found within one's own life and the dreams, reveries, or hypnagogic visions, and the results are then translated into art.  In essence, she states, \"the action of opium may reveal some of the semi-conscious processes by which literature begins to be written\"Hayter, 334\u2014i.e., the act of dreaming (stimulated by opium) crystallizes the past into patterns reflecting truths, and these truths are what inspire the Romantic poetry created by opium users.  Everyone is exposed to these everyday images, but opium adds a further dimension to those images.  Hayter specifies that while opium may enhance these images into a creative piece of text, ironically it also robs the individual of the power to make use of them, because the images are not easily recalled and recorded when sober. The necessary tools to create work like that of the opium-fuelled Romantic poets therefore must include not only the ability to daydream under the influence of the drug, but also the necessity of being able to communicate those visions on paper later.Hayter, 19-341 Hayter's view falls between the two previous literary critiques of opium use during the Romantic era.Hayter, 14"]}, {"page": "Alethea", "response": ["*Alethea Hayter OBE (1911\u20132006), English author and British Council Representative"]}, {"page": "Heinemann Award", "response": ["*1963 Mrs. Browning: A Poet's Work and Its Setting by Alethea Hayter"]}, {"page": "Hayter (surname)", "response": ["*Alethea Hayter (1911\u20132006), English writer"]}, {"page": "Penguin English Library", "response": ["| Thomas De Quincey || Alethea Hayter || Confessions of an English Opium Eater || 61 ||", "| Charles Maturin || Alethea Hayter || Melmoth the Wanderer || 110 || "]}, {"page": "List of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford people", "response": ["* Alethea Hayter, author"]}]}}
