Despite Len Townsend coming into form and going on to become the Bees' top scorer for the season, the goalscoring problem was compounded by the transfer request and subsequent sale of George Wilkins in February. Bill Naylor and Dickie Girling were signed in February to bolster the forward line, but scored just three goals between them before the end of the season. On 24 May, defeat to Sunderland and a draw for 20th-place Charlton Athletic away to Everton consigned the Bees to relegation to the Second Division. By the time of the final day of the season on 14 June, Brentford had lost 14 of the final 19 matches.", "|Bill Naylor", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Bill Naylor", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Bill Naylor", "| Bill Naylor"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["| Bill Naylor"]}]}}
