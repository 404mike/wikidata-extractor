Although its origin has been credited to a Swiss Jungian analyst, Dora Kalff it was in fact, her mentor and trainer, Dr. Margaret Lowenfeld, a British paediatrician, who had developed the Lowenfeld World Technique inspired by the writer H. G. Wells in her work with children,H. G. Wells' Floor Games has been regarded as a precursor not only of learning through play but also of nonverbal child psychotherapy. See Barbara A.

Kalff saw in it potential as a further application of analytical psychology. Encouraged by Jung, Kalff developed the new application over a number of years and called it Sandplay.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  From 1962 she began to train Jungian Analysts in the method including in the United States, Europe and Japan. Both Kalff and Jung believed an image can offer greater therapeutic engagement and insight than words alone. Through the sensory experience of working with sand and objects, and their symbolic resonance new areas of awareness can be brought into consciousness, as in dreams, which through their frames and storyline can bring material into consciousness as part of an integrating and healing process.

It is guided by the notion that if given the chance to speak and play freely in appropriate therapeutic conditions, troubled children and young people will be helped towards resolving their difficulties. Non-directive play therapy is generally regarded as mainly non-intrusive. The hallmark of non-directive play therapy is that it has minimal constraints apart from the frame and thus can be used at any age. These approaches to therapy may originate from Margaret Lowenfeld, Anna Freud, Donald Winnicott, Michael Fordham, Dora Kalff, all of them child specialists or even from the adult therapist, Carl Rogers' non-directive psychotherapy and in his characterisation of \"the optimal therapeutic conditions\". Virginia Axline adapted Carl Rogers's theories to child therapy in 1946 and is widely considered the founder of this therapy.Kendrick, P., Wilson, K., & Ryan, V. (1992) Play Therapy: A Nondirective Approach for Children and Adolescents. North Yorkshire, UK: Elsevier Science Limited. Different techniques have since been established that fall under the realm of non-directive play therapy, including traditional sandplay therapy, play therapy using provided toys and Winnicott's Squiggle and Spatula games.  Each of these forms is covered briefly below.", "Play therapy using a tray of sand and miniature figures is attributed to Dr. Margaret Lowenfeld, a paediatrician interested in child psychology who pioneered her \"World Technique\" in 1929, drawn from the writer H. G. Wells and his Floor Games published in 1911.Sandplay Influences \u2013 Lowenfeld World Technique  Retrieved, 24 June 2009 Dora Kalff, who studied with her, combined Lowenfeld's World Technique with Carl Jung's idea of the collective unconscious and received Lowenfeld's permission to name her version of the work \"sandplay\". As in traditional non-directive play therapy, research has shown that allowing an individual to freely play with the sand and accompanying objects in the contained space of the sandtray (22.5\" x 28.5\") can facilitate a healing process as the unconscious expresses itself in the sand and influences the sand player. When a client creates \"scenes\" in the sandtray, little instruction is provided and the therapist offers little or no talk during the process. This protocol emphasises the importance of holding what Kalff referred to as the \"free and protected space\" to allow the unconscious to express itself in symbolic, non-verbal play. Upon completion of a tray, the client may or may not choose to talk about his or her creation, and the therapist, without the use of directives and without touching the sandtray, may offer supportive response that does not include interpretation. The rationale is that the therapist trusts and respects the process by allowing the images in the tray to exert their influence without interference."]}, {"page": "Cheltenham Ladies' College", "response": ["*Margaret Lowenfeld, paediatrician and child psychotherapist"]}, {"page": "London School of Medicine for Women", "response": ["* Margaret Lowenfeld, child psychologist, psychotherapist and paediatrician, graduated 1918"]}, {"page": "Rhoda M\u00e9traux", "response": ["Rhoda Bubendy M\u00e9traux (18 October 1914, New York City \u2013 26 November 2003, Barton, Vermont) was a prominent anthropologist in the area of cross-cultural studies.
