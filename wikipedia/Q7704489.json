He was author of almost 200 books, mostly pulp novels in the western and crime genres. He wrote under an array of pseudonyms, including George G. Gilman, Joseph Hedges, William M. James, Charles R. Pike, Thomas H. Stone,  Frank Chandler, Jane Harman, Alex Peters, William Pine, William Terry,  James Russell and David Ford. On at least one occasion he wrote as a ghostwriter for Peter Haining (for novel The Hero). Some bibliographies, e.g. Fantastic Fiction, list Adam Hardy as one of Harknett's pseudonyms, in fact a nom de plume of Kenneth Bulmer. This is an error  resulting from incorrect copyright information printed in one of the Edge westerns.\nHarknett wrote a number of fiction series including:\n\nSteve Wayne (9 books under his own name published between 1962 and 1971 by Robert Hale and Hammond)\nCrown (3 books under his own name)\nEdge (61 books as George G. Gilman)\nAdam Steele (49 books as George G. Gilman)\nEdge Meets Adam Steele (3 books as George G. Gilman)\nThe Undertaker (6 books as George G. Gilman)\nThe Revenger (12 books as Joseph Hedges)\nApache (27 books as William M. James)\nJubal Cade (3 books as Charles R. Pike)\n Chester Fortune (5 books as Thomas H. Stone)Harknett's authorship of Edge, Steele, Jubal Cade and Apache series, as well as his fictionalisation of the film A Fistful of Dollars (as by 'Frank Chandler', Tandem Books [1972]) earned him the description of 'One of the authors of \"Blood and Soil\" Western fiction'.Harknett's westerns have been identified as an influence by authors including Robert J. Randisi and Peter Brandvold.George G. Gilman is one pseudonym, or pen name, of Terry Harknett.  Under that name Harknett wrote three series of Western books:  Edge, which his US publisher would brand, \"The Most Violent Westerns In Print\"; Adam Steele (this character and Edge appeared together in three books); and The Undertaker.  The Gilman books were known for their sardonic and sarcastic humor and for their very violent content.\nIn 2015 Amazon Studios aired a TV pilot titled Edge based on the book series of the same name, adapted by Shane Black and Fred Dekker and directed by Shane Black.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Angus Wells", "response": ["Angus Wells (26 March 1943 \u2013 11 April 2006) was a British writer of genre fiction, including fantasy and westerns.
