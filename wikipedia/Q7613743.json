He, along with his assistant Paul Olsson, resigned from the post on 7 October 1999 following the fall out from Trinity's FA Cup Third Qualifying Round Replay 2\u20131 defeat at home to Droylsden two days previously which saw Trinity players Mick Norbury and Neil Lacey sent-off: Lacey for a late tackle which caused the Droyslden bench to invade the pitch and Norbury after the final whistle.\nIn October 2000 he was appointed manager at Frickley Athletic with the club struggling at the foot of the Northern Premier League Premier Division with just six points from 14 league games. He subsequently guided the club to the First Round proper of the FA Cup as well as ensuring the club avoided relegation with a last day victory at Lancaster City giving the club 45 points from 44 matches.\nIn September 2001, following a run of eight games without a win, he resigned his post at Frickley Athletic, but wasted no time in finding a new club as he succeeded Peter Daniel as manager of Goole.In October 2003 he was appointed manager at Ossett Town with the club rock bottom of the Northern Premier League Division One with just three points from 13 games but Richards managed to steer them to fourteenth place by the end of the season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gainsborough Trinity F.C.", "response": ["|1998\u20131999||align=left| Steve Richards||||22 August 1998||15 October 1999||52||23||10||19"]}, {"page": "Stephen Richards", "response": ["* Steve Richards (born 1960), British television and radio presenter and newspaper political columnist", "* Steve Richards (footballer) (born 1961), Scottish former footballer"]}, {"page": "Ernie Moss", "response": ["In June 1998 he took charge at Conference outfit Leek Town, though was dismissed the following year after Leek were relegated, finishing nine points below the safety of Welling United. He was back in charge at Gainsborough by November 1999, replacing Steve Richards. He led the club to another tenth-place finish in 1999\u20132000. In 2000, he was appointed assistant manager of Kettering Town under Peter Morris, though the pair were sacked in February 2001, with the club bottom of the Conference."]}, {"page": "Steve Cherry", "response": ["Cherry featured eight times at the start of the 1997\u201398 season before being dropped by manager Brian Talbot. Talbot released him from his contract at Nene Park in September 1997 and set him up for a part-time arrangement at Rothwell Corinthians in the United Counties League Division One. He swiftly joined Northern Premier League Premier Division side Gainsborough Trinity on wages of \u00a3165-a-week, with the promise of a \u00a3500 signing-on fee from manager Steve Richards. He returned to the Conference with Stalybridge Celtic in January 1998, making ten appearances in a brief stay at Bower Fold. He played the opening game of the Third Division 1998\u201399 season for Mansfield Town on 9 August 1998, a 3\u20130 defeat at Brentford, as regular custodian Ian Bowling was unavailable and Steve Parkin needed a goalkeeper for the one match. He later provided cover for Oldham Athletic, with Oldham manager Andy Ritchie providing a \u00a3200 fee to be in the match-day squad against Wycombe Wanderers."]}, {"page": "Paul Evans (football manager)", "response": ["In 1986, Neil Warnock went to Scarborough as Manager and he took Evans, his former goalkeeper at Burton Albion, with him as his Assistant Manager. Warnock and Evans arrived at Scarborough and quickly signed Cec Podd, Barry Gallagher and Paul Kendell from Halifax Town, Mike Brolly and Tommy Graham from Scunthorpe United, David Kaye from Chester City and Andy Harrison and Steve Richards from Kettering Town. Warnock also added Stuart Mell who was with Warnock and Evans at Burton Albion. The season started pretty average so Warnock signed Ian Bennyworth and Mitch Cook. With the season still going pretty average; Warnock signed Kevin Blackwell on a months loan from Barnet in November 1986 and this started an upturn in fortunes. After the months loan ended Warnock paid Barry Fry's Barnet \u00a32,000 for Blackwell's services. On 13 December Scarborough went top of the league following Barnet's loss to Maidstone United. However, a week after this the club was knocked sideways as the chairman; Barry Adamson died of a heart attack at an FA Trophy game against Morecambe. At one point in April, Scarborough were seven points clear at the top of the GM Vauxhall Conference, and due to Barnet losing at Stafford Rangers Scarborough won the title and were subsequently promoted to the Fourth Division. Basically, Warnock and Evans had brought instant success with Scarborough winning the Football Conference in 1987. Warnock and Evans remained at Scarborough until they moved on to Notts County in 1989 after Warnock had fallen out with chairman Geoffrey Richmond."]}, {"page": "Ian Bennyworth", "response": ["Playing alongside Steve Richards and Paul Kendall, Bennyworth was a regular in Scarborough's defence as they won the division, six points clear of favourites Barnet, to become the first team to benefit from the introduction of direct promotion and relegation between Conference and League in place of the longstanding re-election system. His second appearance in the Football League was Scarborough's first: a 2\u20132 draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers marred by \u00a320,000-worth of damage to the ground, fighting on the terraces, 54 arrests, and a visiting supporter falling through the roof of a stand. The Guardian correspondent thought him \"outstanding\" as Scarborough won at Scunthorpe United in November."]}]}}
