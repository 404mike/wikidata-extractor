The film was cut to one of the first recordings of  \"Interstellar Overdrive\" performed by Pink Floyd, whose lead guitarist Syd Barrett was a friend of Stern's. It won awards for cinematography at the Oberhausen, Melbourne and Sydney Film Festivals.\nLater he began developing a non linear film concept with Syd Barrett called \"Wheel\", an impressionistic piece, which was designed to be seen many times, with each viewing the audience making new discoveries.\nOn 14 April 1969, Stern went to the Royal Festival Hall to film Pink Floyd as they rehearsed for their 'Man/Journey' show, billed as 'The Massed Gadgets of Auximenes' \u2013 More Furious Madness from Pink Floyd. The filming was interrupted by a RFH official who demanded he stop as no permission to film had been granted by RFH officials.\nStern also made the experimental films 'Serendipity' and 'Ain't Misbehavin'\", pioneering the use of 16 mm single frame cinematography in the late 1960s.\nPursuing his fascination with colour and materials through which light passes, Stern completed an MA at the Royal College of Art in Glass and is a glass maker. His work is included in the collections of Queen Elizabeth II, Sir Elton John, the Saudi Royal Family (Red Sea Palace), the Victoria & Albert Museum, Barclays Bank, Morgan Stanley, the Nomura Group, Sir Derek Jacobi, and the Broadfield House Glass Museum, to name but a few. Anthony's work as a glass artist has also been the subject of the film 'Lit From Within: The Art of Anthony Stern'.\nIn 2004, Anthony completed work on his film 'The Noon Gun', based on material filmed in 1971, when Stern travelled to Afghanistan with his 16 mm camera. The footage, rediscovered in 2003, forms the basis of this film-poem, which features a soundtrack by the world fusion musicians Equa.\nProduced and edited by the multi-media artist and director Sadia Sadia, working with the composer and sound designer Stephen W Tayler, the film had its world premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival. Since then it has been shown in the UK at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, as well as featuring in the 2005 'Films From The South' Festival in Oslo, Norway. Stern attended the Festival as a guest speaker, supported by the British Council. Subsequently, then the film has been broadcast on Tolo TV, the most popular liberal TV station in Kabul, Afghanistan, as well as on the Bhutan Broadcasting Service (the only service to broadcast within the Bhutanese border).\nIn 2016, Lost and Found: The Memory Marbles of Anthony Stern, a compilation of films and photos by  Stern were featured on BBC4 as part of a series of programmes curated by Keith Richards and Julien Temple, known collectively as Keith Richards' Lost Weekend.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Music video", "response": ["Besides the Beatles, many other UK artists made \"filmed inserts\" so they could be screened on TV when the bands were not available to appear live. The Who featured in several promotional clips, beginning with their 1965 clip for \"I Can't Explain\". Their plot clip for \"Happy Jack\" (1966) shows the band acting like a gang of thieves. The promo film to \"Call Me Lightning\" (1968) tells a story of how drummer Keith Moon came to join the group: The other three band members are having tea inside what looks like an abandoned hangar when suddenly a \"bleeding box\" arrives, out of which jumps a fast-running, time lapse, Moon that the other members subsequently try to get a hold of in a sped-up slapstick chasing sequence to wind him down. Pink Floyd produced promotional films for their songs, including \"San Francisco: Film\", directed by Anthony Stern, \"Scarecrow\", \"Arnold Layne\" and \"Interstellar Overdrive\", the latter directed by Peter Whitehead, who also made several pioneering clips for The Rolling Stones between 1966 and 1968. The Kinks made one of the first \"plot\" promotional clips for a song. For their single \"Dead End Street\" (1966) a miniature comic movie was made. The BBC reportedly refused to air the clip because it was considered to be in \"poor taste\"."]}, {"page": "Quantum Jump", "response": ["Quantum Jump were formed in 1973 at Farmyard rehearsal studios by Trevor Morais and Jeffrey Levinson. The idea for the name came from a conversation Rupert Hine had with Anthony Stern, an ex-Cambridge University friend and filmmaker. \"He had told me about the relatively recent discovery at Cambridge of the manner in which an electron's energy increases and decreases, not linearly as had been long assumed, but in a discrete step, known as a \"quantum\". The term \"quantum jump\" (later to be commonly referred to as \"quantum leap\") was coined by the Cambridge team. I preferred \"jump\", as it had more of a \"soul / funk\" music connotation\"."]}, {"page": "Interstellar Overdrive", "response": ["The studio recording on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the one that most listeners are familiar with, yet several other versions survive from both the recording studio and the stage.
