Tie Me Down! (1990) by Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var. She did casting calls for an agent but was rejected multiple times because the agent felt that she was too young. Cruz commented on the experience, \"I was very extroverted as a kid.... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years.\" In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls. In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, \"She was absolutely magic [at the audition]. It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid.... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within.\""]}, {"page": "Katrina (given name)", "response": ["* Katrina Bayonas (born 1941), English theatrical agent, producer and manager"]}]}}
