Capable of playing in any outfield position, Cook spent the majority of his career as a centre forward. He was best known for his spells at Football League clubs Watford and Fulham. He also played for Berkhamsted Town and Reading, and finished his playing career with a season as player-coach of Banbury United, in the Southern League. In 1960, Cook scored the first ever goal in the Football League Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Berkhamsted Town F.C.", "response": ["* Maurice Cook"]}, {"page": "Len Goulden", "response": ["He remained at Chelsea until 1952, before moving to Hertfordshire in November 1952 for a management opportunity at Watford. His first match in charge was a 1\u20131 draw at home to Coventry, and by the end of 1952\u201353 Goulden had guided his team to a top-10 finish in the Third Division South. That summer he signed Dave Bewley, Roy Brown and Maurice Cook, all of whom went on to play key roles during his reign. After guiding Watford to 4th and 7th in the next two campaigns, Goulden stepped down to become a coach midway through the 1955\u201356 season. However, his successor and former player Johnny Paton's spell yielded just 2 wins from 15 games, including defeat at the hands of non-league clubs Aldershot and Bedford Town. Goulden took over for the remainder of the season, but was only able to salvage a 21st-placed finish.", "After three years coaching overseas, Goulden returned to Watford in 1959, as part of new manager Ron Burgess's coaching staff. Burgess and Goulden's impact was immediate; Watford won promotion from the Fourth Division in 1960, and very nearly a second consecutive promotion in 1961. Goulden departed the following season, again coaching overseas, before returning to management in England with Banbury United in 1965. Goulden, assisted by his former player Maurice Cook, helped Banbury reach the Southern League for the first time in their history. After leaving in 1967, Goulden's final role in football came at Oxford United, where he managed the reserve team from 1969."]}, {"page": "Harold Jarman", "response": ["Jarman earned himself a place in the Pirates history books in just his second season with the club, on 26 September 1960, when he scored Bristol Rovers' first ever goal in the  Football League Cup. Rovers had the honour of participating in the first game ever played in the competition when they faced First Division side Fulham in the opening round of the 1960\u201361 tournament. Maurice Cook had given Fulham the lead in the 9th minute, scoring the first ever goal in the competition, but Jarman equalised seventeen minutes later to seal his place in Rovers folklore. Geoff Bradford added a second goal for Rovers later on, giving them a shock victory over their top-flight opponents."]}, {"page": "List of Fulham F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Maurice CookGraham Leggat", "|Maurice Cook"]}, {"page": "Football League Third Division North versus South representative matches", "response": ["| Maurice Cook", "| Maurice Cook"]}]}}
