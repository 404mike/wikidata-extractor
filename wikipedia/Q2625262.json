As pointed out by his biographer and friend John Forster, these episodes are essentially factual: the description of forced labor to which David is subjected at Murdstone and Grinby reproduces verbatim the autobiographical fragments entrusted to his friend; David's fascination with Dora Spenlow is similar to that inspired by the capricious Maria; the major stages of his career, from his apprenticeship at Doctors' Commons to writing his first novel, via the shorthand reporting of parliamentary procedures, also follow those of its creator."]}, {"page": "Highgate Cemetery", "response": ["* Catherine Dickens, wife of Charles Dickens"]}, {"page": "Great Expectations", "response": ["As Dickens began writing Great Expectations, he undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours. His domestic life had, however, disintegrated in the late 1850s and he had separated from his wife, Catherine Dickens, and was having a secret affair with the much younger Ellen Ternan. It has been suggested that the icy teasing of the character Estella is based on Ellen Ternan's reluctance to become Dickens's mistress.", "The theme of homecoming reflects events in Dickens's life, several years prior to the publication of Great Expectations. In 1856, he bought Gad's Hill Place in Higham, Kent, which he had dreamed of living in as a child, and moved there from faraway London two years later. In 1858, in a painful marriage breakdown, he separated from Catherine Dickens, his wife of twenty-three years. The separation alienated him from some of his closest friends, such as Mark Lemon. He quarrelled with Bradbury and Evans, who had published his novels for fifteen years. In early September 1860, in a field behind Gad's Hill, Dickens burned almost all of his correspondence, sparing only letters on business matters.Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to Wills, 4 September 1860Gladys Storey, Dickens and Daughter, London, Frederick Muller Ltd, 1939, pp.106\u2013107 He stopped publishing the weekly Household Words at the summit of its popularity and replaced it with All the Year Round."]}, {"page": "1851 in literature", "response": ["*Catherine Dickens (as Lady Maria Clutterbuck) \u2013 What Shall We Have for Dinner?"]}, {"page": "Charles Dickens Museum", "response": ["Charles Dickens and his wife Catherine Dickens (n\u00e9e Hogarth) lived here with the eldest three of their ten children, with the older two of Dickens's daughters, Mary Dickens and Kate Macready Dickens being born in the house.Lucinda Hawksley website"]}, {"page": "Niamh Cusack", "response": ["Cusack starred opposite Sean Bean in the 1986 RSC production of Romeo and Juliet.

It is believed that Dickens began an affair with Ternan; however, the true nature of their relationship was kept secret from the general public.  Ternan was clever, charming, a force of character, and interested in literature and the theatre. Dickens referred to Ternan as his \"magic circle of one.\"  According to what is known, matters came to a head in 1858 when Catherine Dickens opened a packet delivered by a London jeweller which contained a gold bracelet meant for Ternan, with a note written by her husband.
