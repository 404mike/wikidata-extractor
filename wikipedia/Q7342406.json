He was a close friend of George Rennie of Phantassie.\nWhile Rennie applied himself to the practice of agriculture, Brown wrote on the science. He published with Rennie and John Shirreff a View of the Agriculture of the West Riding of Yorkshire,, 1799, and a Treatise on Rural Affairs, 2 vols. 1811, and wrote many articles in the Edinburgh Farmer's Magazine, of which he was editor for fifteen years. Some of these articles have been translated into French and German. He died at Drylaw, a steading close to East Linton, on 14 February 1831, in his seventy-fourth year.\nA pseudonymous edition of a work relating to Scottish emigration to Canada, Remarks on the Earl of Selkirk's Observations on the Present State of the Highlands of Scotland \u2026, is attributed to  Brown.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Brown", "response": ["Robert Brown may refer to:", "* Washboard Sam or Robert Brown (1910\u20131966), American musician and singer", "* Robert Brown (British actor) (1921\u20132003), British actor, played M in four James Bond films", "* Robert Brown (American actor) (born 1926), American actor, played Jason Bolt in Here Come the Brides", "* Robert Brown (cartoonist) (1936\u20132007), American painter and cartoonist", "* Robert Brown (musician) (born 1970), lead singer of steampunk band Abney Park", "* Robert Brown (North Carolina musician) (born 1983), multi-instrumentalist of his solo project Epignosis", "* Robert Brown (sailor) (fl. 1830\u20131864), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "* Robert Brown (MP for Gloucester), Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester in 1353 and 1358", "* Sir Robert Brown, 1st Baronet, of Westminster (died 1760), British Member of Parliament", "* Robert Brown (Pennsylvania politician) (1744\u20131823), U.S. congressman from Pennsylvania", "* Robert Brown (English politician) (1921\u20131996)", "* Robert Brown (Ohio politician) (1928\u20131985), member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1979 to 1985", "* Robert Brown (Minnesota politician) (1935\u20132020), member of the Minnesota State Senate", "* Robert Brown (Scottish politician) (born 1947)", "* Robert Brown (Georgia politician) (1950\u20132011), Democratic member of the Georgia State Senate", "* Robert Brown (South Carolina politician) (born 1950), member of the South Carolina House of Representatives", "* Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773) (1773\u20131858), Scottish (Montrose) scientist, explorer, author, botanist: R.Br., after whom Brownian motion is named", "* Robert Brown (New Zealand botanist) (c. 1824\u20131906), New Zealand bootmaker and botanist: R.Br.bis", "* Robert Brown (botanist, born 1842) (1842\u20131895), Scottish (Caithness) explorer, scientist, author, botanist: R.Br.ter", "* Robert Brown (plant physiologist) (1908\u20131999), British scientist, Fellow of the Royal Society", "* J.
