In October 1905 he was appointed as an assistant at the British Museum, where he at first worked on the mammal collection and shortly after was put in charge of the Arachnida and Myriapoda collections, succeeding Reginald Innes Pocock. With the abundant material he had at his disposal, he initially described new spiders, harvestmen, scorpions and millipedes, but soon worked mainly on mites and ticks. He also did some work on the spiders of Australia, the islands of the Indian Ocean, India and Africa. In 1927 ill health forced him to leave the museum and go to Australia and a drier climate, where he continued his Acari studies at the University of Adelaide. In April 1930, taking advantage of an improvement in his health, he set off to return to England, but died at sea before arriving in Colombo.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Hirst \u2013 Arthur Stanley Hirst (1883\u20131930) arachnology, British"]}, {"page": "Annandaliella travancorica", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Arthur Stanley Hirst"]}, {"page": "Hirst (surname)", "response": ["* Arthur Stanley Hirst (1883\u20131930), British entomologist"]}, {"page": "Ornithonyssus bacoti", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Arthur Stanley Hirst"]}, {"page": "William Frederick Purcell", "response": ["He was the first South African zoologist to start a systematic study of spiders, devising keys and providing full descriptions of species.

Lychas, a primarily Asian genus, was largely regarded as polyphyletic and it was long suspected that this scorpion may belong to a different genus. In 2019 it was split into the new genus Afrolychas along with Afrolychas burdoi, a mainland African species believed to be its closest relative, by Franti\u0161ek Kova\u0159\u00edk. The genus name Afrolychas is a reference to the African range of its species and to the fact that the two species used to be members of the genus Lychas. The specific name braueri is in honor of August Brauer, a German zoologist who conducted scientific surveys in the Seychelles and who collected the initial specimens. "]}]}}
