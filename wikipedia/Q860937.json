In 1985, he signed with Sheffield Wednesday, before he moved on to Portsmouth three years later. He remained with \"Pompey\" until 1994, at which point he transferred to Brighton & Hove Albion.

In his autobiography he admitted that he was not keen on joining Portsmouth, but stated that he decided to take a much more professional approach to his career in terms of training and eating healthier food so as to start the 1992\u201393 pre-season in good physical condition; he credited his new approach to the birth of his first child. Ironically though a virus picked up on a family holiday to Saint Lucia caused him to miss a month early in the season and drained him of fitness. He recovered to build a strike partnership with Guy Whittingham, whilst midfielders Alan McLoughlin and Mark Chamberlain made an effective four-pronged attack, and with two games to go Portsmouth were top of the table and needed only to beat relegation threatened Sunderland to secure an automatic promotion place.
