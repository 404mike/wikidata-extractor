Born in Harlesden, Middlesex, he was educated at Winchester College and the University of London.\nA member of the Labour Party from 1918, he was a defender of the Soviet Union. In 1932, as part of G. D. H. Cole's New Fabian Research Bureau's expert commission of enquiry, he visited the Soviet Union, and, according to Margaret Cole, \"the eminent KC swallowed it all\". Pritt was expelled from the Labour Party in March 1940 following his support of the Soviet invasion of Finland.Pritt was characterised by George Orwell as \"perhaps the most effective pro-Soviet publicist in this country\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lee Kuan Yew", "response": ["In May 1954, the left-wing University Socialist Club published an article 'Aggression in Asia' in the club's magazine The Fajar, and the student editors were charged with sedition. Lee was honorary legal advisor of the Club. Two Queens Counsel, Denis Pritt and Dingle Foot offered to defend the editors. Defendant Poh Soo Kai chose Pritt, with Lee became junior counsel to Pritt. When Poh and Lee met Pritt at the Adelphi Hotel, Pritt dismissed Lee and discussed the case privately with Poh. The court squashed the charges and the two counsel gained a reputation through the trial, with Lee thereafter becoming a \"major leader\" of the movement against British rule. During the same year, Lee also appealed on behalf of the students arrested during the 13 May incident. The colonial government upheld the sentences, though the case enhanced Lee's reputation as a \"left-wing lawyer\" and marked his first involvement with the Chinese intelligentsia."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Denis Pritt"]}, {"page": "The Great Terror (book)", "response": ["In the book, Conquest disputed the assertion made by Nikita Khrushchev and supported by many Western leftists, namely that Stalin and his purges were an aberration from the ideals of the October Revolution, and were contrary to the principles of Leninism. Conquest posited that Stalinism was a natural consequence of the system established by Vladimir Lenin, although he conceded that the personal character traits of Stalin had brought about the particular horrors of the late 1930s. Neal Ascherson wrote: \"Everyone by then could agree that Stalin was a very wicked man and a very evil one, but we still wanted to believe in Lenin; and Conquest said that Lenin was just as bad and that Stalin was simply carrying out Lenin's programme.\" Conquest sharply criticized Western intellectuals for what he described as their blindness towards the realities of the Soviet Union, both in the 1930s and in some cases even in the 1960s. He described figures, such as Beatrice Webb and Sidney Webb, George Bernard Shaw, Jean-Paul Sartre, Walter Duranty, Bernard Pares, Harold Laski, Denis Pritt, Theodore Dreiser, and Romain Rolland, as dupes of Stalin and apologists for his regime for denying, excusing, or justifying various aspects of the purges. A widespread story recounts that when he was asked to provide a new title for an anniversary edition, after his initial findings were verified by the opened Soviet archives, Conquest replied: \"How about I Told You So, You Fucking Fools?\" According to Conquest, this never happened and was a joking invention of writer Kingsley Amis."]}, {"page": "Lenin Peace Prize", "response": ["|Denis Pritt(1887\u20131972)"]}, {"page": "List of Parliamentary constituencies in London", "response": ["OTH - 1945 -  (1) Communist Party; (2) Independent Labour (Denis Pritt); 2005 - Respect (George Galloway)"]}, {"page": "Star of People's Friendship", "response": ["| Denis Pritt "]}, {"page": "List of UK minor party and independent MPs elected", "response": ["| Denis Pritt"]}, {"page": "Labour Independent Group", "response": ["All these MPs were known for their communist sympathies, and the four joined with another independent MP, Denis Pritt, who had been expelled from the Labour Party in 1940 for supporting the Soviet Union in the Winter War, to form the Labour Independent Group.

Political activity (unless in support of the Nazi party) became illegal.  Both her Jewishness and her increasingly immoderate politics made Hilde Kirchheimer vulnerable to the methods of the post-democratic German state, and as the arrests started she lost her permit to work in her profession and emigrated, in April 1933, to Paris.  The French capital was rapidly becoming the de facto headquarters of the German Communist Party in exile.   Her younger brother Fredi, still in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, committed suicide early in February 1934.  One of Hilde Kirchheimer's projects in Paris was her participation in producing the so-called Brown Book which, in its 1933 version, set out to chronicle the events surrounding the Reichstag Fire and the ensuing Nazi Terror which the fire was used to justify.   At this time she met Denis Pritt, head of the \"International Commission of Enquiry for Enlightenment about the Reichstag Fire\", which was a London-based \"alternative enquiry\" set up as a response to the official \"Reichstag Fire Trial\" conducted in Leipzig by the government.   During 1935/36, at the invitation of the Workers International Relief organisation, Hilde Kirchheimer made a study of the Soviet justice system, and in 1936 she belatedly became a member of the German Communist Party.   Her husband, from whom she had already been separated for several years, emigrated to the United States in November 1937, probably with their daughter, Hanna: Hilde remained in Paris, working for International Red Aid till 1939.", "In 1950 she was appointed Berlin's \"Director for Justice\", a position she held during the critical years till 1953, and one which enabled her to play a central role in the prosecution of Nazis.   In 1953 she was appointed Party secretary of the \"International Committee of Democratic Jurists\", an organisation on which she worked with the Pro-Soviet London lawyer Denis Pritt.    She was for many years the secretary to the \"German League of Democratic Jurists\" (\"Vereinigung Demokratischer Juristen Deutschlands\"), founded in 1949.   In addition, between November 1953 and July 1959 she was editor in chief of the professional journal, \"Neue Justiz\"."]}, {"page": "Pritt (surname)", "response": ["*Denis Pritt (1877\u20131972), British politician"]}, {"page": "Percy Glading", "response": ["Glading's Old Bailey trial took place only two months after his arrest; this, says Robinson, is testament to how \"clear-cut\" the case against him was. The evidence presented included \"a mass of incriminating documents and photographic material\". Glading pled guilty. His solicitors, instructed by the CPGB, were Denis Pritt, leading, and assisted by Dudley Collard. They\u2014at the CPGB's request\u2014advised him to change his plea to Not Guilty; this Glading did. But they presented little evidence in his favour and carried out only minimal cross-examination, and the defence was unable to question Gray's credibility due to her professional behaviour on the stand. The prosecution, on the other hand, consisted of some of the most well-known advocates of the day and was led by Donald Somervell. Pritt's defence of Whomack was more energetic, and he lambasted the Official Secrets Act for making it \"far too easy to be charged for misdemeanour merely by wandering too close to a dockyard\" or anywhere else such secret plans were kept.The trial judge, Sir Anthony Hawke, told the accused that Glading was \"endeavouring to do anything [he] could to help another country and injure this. This is [his] own country but I cannot quite believe that this had any effect on your mind\". The judge wondered whether, as perhaps evinced by Glading's prosperous existence, he might have profited financially from his work with Moscow and that he was motivated by money rather than ideology. Whatever his motive, the outcome was never in doubt. On 14 March 1938, Glading received a sentence of six years' imprisonment (hard labour). Williams was sentenced to four years, Whomack to three. Munday's charges were withdrawn by the prosecution. Duff argues it is possible that this was the result of his making a deal with MI5 to turn king's evidence and reveal the tradecraft of Glading's operation at the Royal Arsenal. Even the others, comments MI5's official historian, received \"light sentences by the later standards of espionage trials\". This may well have been quid pro quo for pleading guilty and avoiding the need for a full prosecution."]}, {"page": "Pritt, Denis Nowell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Denis Pritt"]}, {"page": "League for Democracy in Greece", "response": ["The League was founded in October 1945 in a public meeting held in Garrick Theatre, London, to commemorate Greece's entering the Second World War against the axis powers.
