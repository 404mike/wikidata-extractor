Ironically Eustace was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who managed to keep Wednesday three points above the relegation zone at the end of the 1988\u201389 season. Turner played 23 of the club's 38 league games in the 1989\u201390 season, as Wednesday dropped out of the top-flight on goal difference. He also spent a two-game spell on loan at Howard Wilkinson's Second Division Leeds United, providing cover for the injured Mervyn Day. Wednesday made an immediate return to the First Division after securing the third automatic promotion place at the end of the 1990\u201391 season. Turner also kept goal in the 1991 League Cup Final, and kept a clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over former club Manchester United."]}, {"page": "Trevor Brooking", "response": ["In June 1967, Brooking made his senior debut in a friendly for West Ham against Grasshopper Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland. His league debut came in place of wide-right Brian Dear on 29 August 1967 in a 3\u20133 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor. His first goal came on 26 December 1967 in a 4\u20132 away win at Leicester City. His first season saw him play 28 games, scoring nine goals. His second season saw 37 appearances and eight goals. His only hat-trick came on 6 April 1968 in a 5\u20130 home defeat of Newcastle. In December 1969, during his third season, Brooking chipped a bone in his ankle in a game against Nottingham Forest. The club signed Peter Eustace for \u00a390,000 to take his place; his recovery took longer than expected, and he considered giving up the game. However, he returned to playing and with the departure of Martin Peters to Tottenham in March 1970, Brooking became a regular in midfield. His place in the side came under threat in the 1971\u201372 season with the purchase of midfielder Tommy Taylor, and Brooking was transfer-listed at his own request. However, the failure of the defensive partnership between Bobby Moore and Alan Stephenson saw Stephenson dropped and Taylor being moved into defence; Brooking remained an ever-present for the rest of the season and was voted Hammer of the Year. During the 1972\u201373 season he came to the attention of Derby County manager Brian Clough, who offered West Ham \u00a3400,000 for Brooking and Moore, but Greenwood refused to let the pair leave. Again, in 1974 Tottenham manager Bill Nicholson offered \u00a3425,000 for the signature of Brooking. According to Brooking in his autobiography, this move was not pursued as he felt Nicholson, a manager he admired, was coming to the end of his Tottenham career and he was unsure of which manager would follow him."]}, {"page": "Eustace", "response": ["*Peter Eustace (born 1944), English football player"]}, {"page": "Frank Clark (footballer)", "response": ["After his playing career he was assistant manager of Sunderland from 1979 to 1982 and then became manager of Leyton Orient.
