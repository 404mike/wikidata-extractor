He became the first person in the United Kingdom to hold a pilots certificate for an airship when the Royal Aero Club awarded him Airship Pilots Certificate No. 1.\nWillows was born in Cardiff, Wales on 11 July 1886. He was educated at Clifton College in Bristol, entering the school in 1896 and leaving  in 1901 aged 15 to train as a dentist.\nHe built his first airship, the Willows No. 1, in 1905 when he was 19. It was first flown  from East Moors, Cardiff on 5 August 1905, the flight lasting 85 minutes. This was soon followed by an improved Willows No. 2, in which he landed outside Cardiff City Hall on 4 June 1910. No. 2 was re-built as No. 3 which he named the City of Cardiff before he flew it from London to Paris in 1910. This was the first airship crossing of the English Channel at night and the first from England to France. The journey was not without incident, including dropping the maps over the side during the night, and problems with the envelope caused the airship to land at Corbehem near Douai at two o'clock in the morning. With the help of the local French aviator Louis Breguet the airship was repaired and arrived at Paris on 28 December 1910. He celebrated New Year's Eve with a flight around the Eiffel Tower.\nWillows moved to Birmingham to build his next airship, the Willows No. 4. First flown in 1912, it was sold to the Admiralty for \u00a31,050 and it became His Majesty's Naval Airship No. 2.\nWith the money from the Navy Willows established a spherical gas balloon school at Welsh Harp, Hendon near London, although this did not stop him building Willows No. 5 in 1913, a four-seater airship designed to give joy rides over London.\nDuring the first world war Willows built kite or barrage balloons in  Cardiff. After the war he continued with ballooning but on 3 August 1926 he died in a balloon accident at Hoo Park, Kempston, Bedford instantly, together with a passenger. Three other passengers died later that day either in hospital or on their way to it making 5 deaths in all\nThere is a school named Willows High School built on his old airfield to remember him. There is also a pub called The Ernest Willows which is situated not far from the school.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Willows High School", "response": ["The school site is extensive and dates from the late 1960s, and was built on the site of the World War II airfield RAF Pengam Moors.

His third airship Willows No. 3 - City of Cardiff flew from Cardiff to London on 6 August 1910.

He immediately followed this with a flight from London to Paris establishing the first airship flight across the English Channel at night."]}, {"page": "Frank Goodden", "response": ["He left school aged 16 and worked in engineering for three years before joining the balloon manufacturing company C. G. Spencer and Sons in 1908. The following year he made his first balloon flight, before giving exhibition flights in towns across Britain. Goodden left Spencers in October 1910 to be the engineer for Ernest Willows in his Airship No. 3 \"City of Cardiff\" on a flight between London and Paris. The airship took off from Wormwood Scrubbs mid-afternoon on 4 November, taking three hours to reach the English coast and another two to cross the Channel. After night fell, cloud and fog meant they became lost over France, eventually setting down at Corbehem near Douai. Louis Breguet drove from his flying ground at La Brayelle nearby, to offer assistance in making repairs. Willows intended to continue the flight to the aerodrome at Issy in Paris the next day, but the weather deteriorated, and instead he packed up the airship and had it transported there by train. They stayed in Paris for several weeks, celebrating the New Year by making several circuits around the Eiffel Tower."]}, {"page": "Reginald Foster Dagnall", "response": ["Dagnall was born in Fulham, London in 1888 the son of Walter and Frances Dagnall, he was educated at Tiffin School, Kingston upon Thames.  Dagnall started his career in the drawing office of the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company. He then joined Ernest Willows in developing Willows airships and during the 1914-18 war he was first works manager and then general manager of Airships Limited., a firm which made kite balloons and blimps."]}, {"page": "List of British airships", "response": ["Airship development in the United Kingdom lagged behind that of Germany and France. The first British designed and built airship was constructed by Stanley Spencer, and on 22 September 1902 was flown  from Crystal Palace, London to Ruislip, carrying an advertisement for baby food. A series of more practical airships was constructed by Ernest Willows, the \"Willows Number 1\" making its first flight near Cardiff on 5 August 1905.   The Royal Navy realised that airships similar to Ferdinand von Zeppelin's designs could be of great use and in 1909 ordered construction of a rigid airship. This was completed in 1911 but was wrecked while leaving the hangar before it had flown. Meanwhile, the British Army's School of Ballooning, later the Air Battalion Royal Engineers, acquired a small fleet of semi-rigid and non-rigid airships for observation purposes; they were taken over by the Royal Navy on the creation of the Royal Naval Air Service in 1914. A large number of rigid and non-rigid airships were mainly used to counter the U-Boat campaign in World War I. Interest in military airships declined at the end of the war, but some success in the commercial field inspired the Imperial Airship Scheme; however, the disastrous crash of the R101 in 1930 ended serious government and commercial interest in airships. Since the 1970s, there have been persistent efforts to revive a British airship industry, using new designs, materials and technologies.", ":Willows Numbers 1 to 5 - constructed by Ernest Willows from 1905."]}, {"page": "List of English Channel crossings by air", "response": ["|Ernest Willows (UK)"]}]}}
