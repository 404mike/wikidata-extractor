After turning from the law to the stage, Fagan began an acting career, including four years from 1895 to 1899 with Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company at Her Majesty's Theatre.  He then began writing plays, returning eventually to acting during World War I.  In 1920 he took over London's Court Theatre as a Shakespearean playhouse and soon began to produce plays at other West End theatres.  His adaptation of Treasure Island in 1922 was a hit and became an annual Christmas event.\nHe was the first manager of the Oxford Playhouse for several years in the 1920s.  As a producer, he popularised Anton Chekhov and Se\u00e1n O'Casey in Britain.  In 1929, he was a director of the Festival Theatre, Cambridge.  Several of his plays were adapted for film, and he moved to Hollywood in his last years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Savoy Theatre", "response": ["In 1915 Richard D'Oyly Carte's son, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, took over management of the theatre.

This sketch was in the form of a court case in which Shakespeare sues Shaw following a lecture Shaw had given earlier in the year in which he had said that Shakespeare was a \"narrow minded middle class man\" with \"no religion, no politics, no great concerns\". Shaw often participated in these skits, by lending costumes, or even writing dialogue for one entitled His Wild Oat (1926). The ghosts of Shakespeare and Shaw also appear in Back to G.B.S.; or A Midsummer Nightmare (1932), a fantasia set in the year 2156, when the two playwrights have become confused with each other. Another, Bernard Shaw Arrives: A Fantasy in One Act was a parody of Don Juan in Hell in which Shaw, Shakespeare and Mephistopheles engage in a debate.Archibald Henderson, George Bernard Shaw: Man of the Century, Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York, 1956, p.720ff."]}, {"page": "Molly MacArthur", "response": ["Her first work for the theatre was seen at the Oxford Playhouse in 1923\u201324 for J.
