He represented Great Britain at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. He also represented Great Britain at two World Championships, and Scotland at two Commonwealth Games. His best time for the 3000m steeplechase of 8:12.58 on 3 August 1991 in Monaco, is the Scottish record (as of 2016) and ranks him third on the British all-time list behind Mark Rowland and Colin Reitz.\nHanlon was born in West Germany. His father was a royal signals warrant officer. He finished fourth in the 2000m steeplechase at both the 1985 European Junior Championships, and the 1986 World Junior Championships. After finishing a disappointing 12th at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in January, he went on to finish sixth at the 1990 European Championships in August. He ran 8:18.14 to finish sixth in the 3000m steeplechase final at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. He also reached the World Championship finals in 1991 and 1993.\nHanlon, who also worked in advertising and sports magazines in the 1980s, is a four-time Scottish champion at 1500m (1987\u201390). He also finished second at the AAA Championships in the 3000 m steeplechase (1990) and the 1500m (1992).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["| 6 || align=\"left\" | Tom Hanlon || align=\"left\" | "]}, {"page": "1991 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["Defending champion Francesco Panetta took the early lead, shadowed by Tom Hanlon.  The ever dangerous Kenyan team scattered toward the rear of the pack, but quickly moved forward as a group to join the train behind Hanlon.  The first action happened on the third lap when Hagen Melzer and Graeme Fell, found themselves lying on the track after Fell fell over a barrier.  Later in the lap, the Kenyans tired of training Hanlon and moved directly behind Panetta.  Finally, the fourth time over the water jump, the entire Kenyan team passed Panetta.  Over th next lap, Panetta began to fall back, leaving a 5-man break on the front, with Abdelaziz Sahere and Azzedine Brahmi tagging on behind the Kenyans.  Behind the group, Panetta, Brian Diemer and Angelo Carosi were chasing trying to bridge the gap.  Of the Kenyans, the order was consistently World 1500m Junior Champion Moses Kiptanui leading Patrick Sang, with Olympic champion Julius Kariuki.  On the penultimate lap, the Kenyans appeared to slow, enough for the breakaway group to catch the back temporarily, before the Kenyans again accelerated away.  During the acceleration, Kariuki upset the patter by moving up to Kiptanui's shoulder.  By the bell, only Brahmi was able to hold on to the back of Sang, the trailing Kenyan as Kariuki spent the next half lap challenging Kiptanui for the lead.  Down the backstretch, Brahmi passed Sang before the water jump, but after the water it was again the three Kenyans on the front.  As they hit the final straight, Kiptanui held a 2-metre lead over Sang, while Kariuki took the turn wide enough to allow Brahmi to fall in behind Sang, with Kariuki effectively conceding a Kenyan sweep and the bronze medal to him with 80 metres to go.  Down the stretch, Sang accelerated enough for Kiptanui to sense his presence, then Kiptanui sped up to take a decisive victory."]}, {"page": "1985 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Junior men's race", "response": ["|align=center|  47 || align=left | Tom Hanlon || align=left |  || 24:10", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Tom Hanlon || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 47"]}, {"page": "1986 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Junior men's race", "response": ["|align=center| 134 || align=left | Tom Hanlon || align=left |  || 25:57.4", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Tom Hanlon || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 134"]}, {"page": "1994 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["| 10 || align=left | Tom Hanlon || align=left |  || 8:36.06 || ", "| 5 || align=left | Tom Hanlon || align=left |  || 8:31.50 || q"]}, {"page": "1986 World Junior Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's 2000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["| 4 || align=left | Tom Hanlon || align=left |  || 5:32.84 || ", "| 2 || align=left | Tom Hanlon || align=left |  || 5:38.18 || Q"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1990 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["| 12 ||align=left| Tom Hanlon ||align=left|  || 8:45.76 ||"]}, {"page": "1989 IAAF World Cup \u2013 Results", "response": ["| 5 || align=\"left\" | Tom Hanlon || align=left| Great Britain || 8:28.34 || 5 ||"]}, {"page": "1988 European Athletics Indoor Championships \u2013 Men's 1500 metres", "response": ["| 9 || 1 || align=\"left\" | Tom Hanlon ||align=left|  || 3:43.75 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1986 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 1500 metres", "response": ["| 20 || 1 ||align=left| Tom Hanlon ||align=left|  || 3:50.57 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1986 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 3000 metres steeplechase", "response": ["| 10 ||align=left| Tom Hanlon ||align=left|  || 8:53.56 ||"]}, {"page": "Eddie Wedderburn", "response": ["Wedderburn achieved his lifetime best in the 3000m steeplechase on 5 July 1988 at the DN Galan in Stockholm, running 8:18.32.
