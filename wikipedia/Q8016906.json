He was the first to introduce the Clipper class of ship to the river Wear, Sunderland. A testament to his art can be seen today, the Composite Clipper ship City of Adelaide. The ship was classed as \"Experimental\" by Lloyd's of London in 1864; it would be a few years before Lloyds would formalise the rules for constructing composite ships, the rules for which were used for the design and construction of the composite Clipper ship Cutty Sark.\nHis bust, now on display in the Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens, was paid for by donations from his friends.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
