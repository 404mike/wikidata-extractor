Waterford had big derbies with Cork City in the 2000s when Waterford were in the Premier Division and then again when Cork City Foras entered the First Division in the early 2010s. The derby with Cork always being Munsters biggest clash died off when Cork City started challenging the top of the table in the Premier Division and Waterford plummeted to the bottom end of the First Division around 2014. When Waterford drew Cork in the cups the club would usually be easily beaten. When Waterford played Cork in Turners Cross in the EA Sports Cup in 2016 they were beaten 7\u20130. However the rivalry was somewhat rekindled in 2017 after Waterford were taken over by Lee Power, a heavy challenge by Patrick McClean on Corks Sean Maguire caused controversy, it led to a huge dispute on social media between Waterford and Cork players with Irish internationals James McClean and Shane Duffy also getting involved defending Patrick's tackle. And despite Waterford being in the First Division they manage to secure the signing of Waterford born Cork centre back Kenny Browne who was on the back of a great season where he starred for the rebels as they won the FAI Cup. The move caused huge controversy with Cork manager John Caulfield. Both clubs are now back in the top division for 2018 along with Limerick."]}, {"page": "Danny Graham (footballer)", "response": ["On 23 June 2016, Graham signed a two-year permanent deal with Blackburn reserving the option to extend for a third year.

In November, he scored a brace in a 3\u20132 victory over Brentford. He scored his first goal in the 15th minute which equalised Scott Hogan's first-minute goal.
