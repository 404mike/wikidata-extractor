He served in the Gambia, where he was Acting Administrator of the Gambia from 27 November 1887 to 6 June 1888. He was appointed as the first Administrator of the Seychelles in February 1889, and served until 1895. During his first six months, Griffith realised that religion was a key social factor for the 16,000 inhabitants of the island, especially in relation to education. His main concern was the creation of a non-denominational school, in which the language of instruction would be English. However, as Griffith was a Protestant, it was impossible to convince the Catholic church that he was not biased. In 1890, Griffith wrote to Sir Daniel Morris to suggest that an experienced botanist come to the Seychelles to run an experimental botanical garden, if finances allowed it."]}, {"page": "Henry Alfred Alford Nicholls", "response": ["In the early 1880s - during Hooker's last few years as Director of Kew - Nicholls was the Kew correspondent for Dominica. For that reason Nicholls dedicated his Text-Book on Tropical Agriculture to Sir Joseph. The demand for it was such that the book was reprinted seven times at intervals of about five years; it was also translated into several languages along with Swiss-Venezuelan geographer and botanist Henri Fran\u00e7ois Pittier. Nicholls wrote many letters to Hooker, Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, Daniel Morris and others at Kew. He also contributed plants and seeds to the collection there."]}]}}
