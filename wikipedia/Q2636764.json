The current line-up (since 2018) includes original guitarist Stuart \"Woody\" Wood, singer Ian Thomson, bassist Marcus Cordock, and drummer Jamie McGrory.", "In 1964, a trio called the Ambassadors was formed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by 16-year-old Alan Longmuir on acoustic guitar, his younger brother Derek Longmuir on drums, and their older cousin Neil Porteous on acoustic guitar. The group never performed publicly under this name, just a family wedding where they covered \"Wake Up Little Susie\". They changed their name to the Saxons, and Derek invited a friend from school, Gordon \"Nobby\" Clark, to be the lead singer. Porteous moved from acoustic to electric guitar, and Alan Longmuir followed suit by changing to electric bass.Coy, W. (2005), Bay City Babylon: The Unbelievable But True Story of the Bay City Rollers, pp 12\u201313. Hats Off Books,  The Saxons played occasional dance hall concerts while the band members completed their schooling or worked during the day (Alan apprenticed as a plumber). Porteous left the band in July 1965, with new guitarist Dave Pettigrew filling the spot after answering an advertisement placed by the band in an Edinburgh newspaper. Pettigrew was more advanced musically than the others, and pushed the band to improve. Their repertoire included American R&B/pop songs such as \"Please Mr. Postman\" and \"Heat Wave\". They played at least one gig at the Gonk Club as the Deadbeats, but they discovered a conflict: another band was playing locally as Rock Bottom and the Deadbeats.", "In late 1973, McKeown recorded lead vocals on \"Remember (Sha-La-La-La)\", and a lead-in to a series of UK chart hits. 16-year-old Stuart Wood completed the \"classic five\" line-up in February 1974, a week after the band had debuted the \"Remember\" single on Top of the Pops. (John Devine had mimed the piano part). By early 1975, the band was well on the way to achieving global success. The \"classic five\" line-up consisted of: Alan Longmuir, Derek Longmuir, Stuart \"Woody\" Wood, Eric Faulkner and Les McKeown.", "Alan Longmuir had left the group by early 1976, due to both the pressures of the band's success and feeling discomfort at being a member of a teen band whilst in his late twenties. He was replaced for seven months by 17-year-old Ian Mitchell from Northern Ireland; he was the first band member born outside Edinburgh. With Mitchell, the group released an album titled Dedication (1976), and hit the charts with a cover version of the Dusty Springfield song, \"I Only Want to Be with You. \" The song reached US No.\u00a012, as well as \"Yesterday's Hero\" (featuring live material from a 1976 personal appearance in Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square), and \"Dedication\".", "In 1990, Wood and Alan Longmuir joined with Faulkner to tour under the Bay City Rollers name, and issued several CDs of re-recordings of the old Roller tunes.", "On 22 September 2015, the Bay City Rollers, including McKeown, Wood, and Alan Longmuir, announced they were reforming and would play a show at the Glasgow Barrowlands on 20 December.  Eric Faulkner was unable to contribute because of health concerns, almost dying in February 2015 after contracting viral encephalitis. The band released one new single, \"Boomerang\", and discussed plans for a new album.  The reunion continued into 2016 before Wood ended the reunited line-up on 9 July 2016 because no shows were being booked for the so-called reunion. After the 2015 Christmas shows Les was booking shows only for himself and his band during 2016 (Except T In The Park) which caused the reunion to end.  Plans for a new album and various tours that were hoped to take place in 2017 never materialised. Prior to the reunion and after the end of the tour, McKeown continued to tour as \"Les McKeown's Bay City Rollers\".", "Bassist Alan Longmuir died on 2 July 2018 after falling ill while on holiday with his wife in Mexico.

In his book, Alan Longmuir mentioned his hope for McKeown and Wood to put aside their differences and reunite one more time.
