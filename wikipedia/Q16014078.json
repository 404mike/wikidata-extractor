He started to paint in 1936 and went to the Penzance School of Art in 1938. At the end of the war, he spent a short time in Greece at the Athens School of Art and then the Exeter College of Art 1946-1949 and then to the West of England College of Art, Bristol 1949-50. He was a member of the Newlyn Society of Artists and the Penwith Society of Arts, and exhibited regularly in St Ives (including at the Sail Loft Gallery), Newlyn, Plymouth and London. His artwork is in several public collections, details of which can be found on the Art UK website.His themes are mostly the fishing boats and harbours around Mounts Bay, painted energetically, in styles from the figurative, to the near abstraction of the 1960s. At Art School he was known as \"PZ 81\" given his compulsive rendering of his father's fishing boat \"the Lyonesse\".\nHe was remembered alongside artists Patrick Heron, Terry Frost and Tony O\u2019Malley in Margo Maeckelberghe's obituary.The Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol gave him one man shows in the 1960s and he showed extensively at the Orion Gallery, Penzance and the Newlyn Orion in the 1970s. Several BBC films were also made about him and his life in Mousehole. In 1985 a work was included in the landmark Tate Gallery exhibition St Ives 1939-64. After this he was taken up by the Belgrave Gallery, London, Leon Shuddaby Fine Art, Penzance, and the Rainy Day Gallery, Penzance. There was a major retrospective of his work in 2008 at the Penlee House Gallery and Museum, Penzance.He is survived by his daughter, the artist Tamsin Pender, and son Robin Pender.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mousehole", "response": ["Admiral of the fleet Sir Caspar John GCB (1903\u20131984) lived in Mousehole in retirement. The artist Jack Pender (1918\u20131998) was born in Mousehole and spent most of his career there. English writer and illustrator Michelle Cartlidge lives in Mousehole."]}, {"page": "Peter Liddle (artist)", "response": ["While still living in London Liddle began painting the Cornish coast, three paintings from this period were selected for the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1965. Later that year Peter and Patricia relocated to a studio in Cornwall where he began to experiment with acrylic paint, exhibiting regularly with both The Newlyn Society of Artists and the Penwith Society of Arts. Two of his closest peers while in Cornwall were the painters Margo Maeckelberghe and Jack Pender. During this five-year period Liddle's style changed completely. He credits the challenge of the incredible Portholland light in his transition from heavy, textured, oils to whiter, more transparent, acrylics."]}, {"page": "Albert Reuss", "response": ["Whilst Albert painted, Rosa managed the ARRA Gallery together with their friend, Jeanne Day, and in collaboration with the Arts Council of Great Britain, hosting local artists such as Mousehole-born Jack Pender (1918\u20131998) and Alexander Mackenzie (1923 -2002) of the St Ives School. The gallery eventually closed in 1956. Between 1945 and 1956, Rosa also organised numerous solo exhibitions of her husband's work in municipal galleries throughout England, particularly in the North, where many galleries still hold his works."]}]}}
