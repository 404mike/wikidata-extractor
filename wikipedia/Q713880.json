The mod scene in Los Angeles and Orange County was partly influenced by the 2 Tone ska revival in England, and was unique in its racial diversity, with black, white, Hispanic and Asian participants. The 1990s Britpop scene featured noticeable mod influences on bands such as Oasis, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene and The Bluetones.

Miniskirts became progressively shorter between the early and mid-1960s. As female mod fashion became more mainstream, slender models like Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy began to exemplify the mod look. Maverick fashion designers emerged, such as Mary Quant, who was known for her miniskirt designs, and John Stephen, who sold a line named \"His Clothes\" and whose clients included bands such as Small Faces. The television programme Ready Steady Go! helped spread awareness of mod fashions to a larger audience. Mod-culture continues to influence fashion, with the ongoing trend for mod-inspired styles such as 3-button suits, Chelsea boots and mini dresses. The Mod Revival of the 1980s and 1990s led to a new era of mod-inspired fashion, driven by bands such as Madness, The Specials and Oasis. The popularity of the This Is England film and TV series also kept mod fashion in the public eye. Today's mod icons include Miles Kane (frontman of the Last Shadow Puppets), cyclist Bradley Wiggins and Paul Weller, 'The ModFather'."]}, {"page": "Falls Festival", "response": ["*Miles Kane"]}, {"page": "Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim", "response": ["* Miles Kane"]}, {"page": "Dan the Automator", "response": ["* Miles Kane - Colour of the Trap (2011)"]}, {"page": "The Lightning Seeds", "response": ["In 2014, the songs and career of Ian Broudie were celebrated in a concert held at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, featuring the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic orchestra and performances by Ian McCulloch (Echo And The Bunnymen), Miles Kane (The Last Shadow Puppets), Terry Hall (The Specials), James Skelly (The Coral) and Broudie himself with a band featuring musicians Sean Payne (The Zutons), Bill Ryder Jones and Nick Power (The Coral) and Broudie's son, Riley.

It was produced in London by Mike Crossey and James Ford. As of 2020, Ford has produced every subsequent Turner project. Lyrically, the album touches on fame, love, and heartache. Turner and Bennett had ended their relationship in January; she was credited as a co-writer on \"Fluorescent Adolescent\". While uninterested in the songs concerning fame, Marc Hogan of Pitchfork said the album displayed Turner's \"usual gift for vivid imagery\" and explored \"new emotional depth\". Petridis of The Guardian noted that the band were \"pushing gently but confidently at the boundaries of their sound\", with hints of \"woozy psychedelia\" and \"piledriving metal\". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while Arctic Monkeys headlined Glastonbury Festival in the summer of 2007. Also that year, Turner began to collaborate with other artists. He worked with rapper Dizzee Rascal on the Arctic Monkeys B-side \"Temptation\", a version of which also featured on Rascal's album Maths and English. He co-wrote three songs on Reverend and The Makers' debut album The State Of Things, after briefly sharing a Sheffield flat with the frontman Jon McClure. Another Sheffield singer, Richard Hawley, featured on the Arctic Monkeys' B-side \"Bad Woman\" and performed with the band at the Manchester Apollo, as part of a concert film directed by Richard Ayoade. Turner also announced plans to form a side-project band, The Last Shadow Puppets, with Ford and Miles Kane, whom he had befriended during a tour in mid-2005.", "While living in Brooklyn, New York, where he moved with Chung in the spring of 2009, Turner wrote an acoustic soundtrack for the coming-of-age feature film Submarine (2010); it was released as an EP in March 2011. Director Richard Ayoade initially approached Turner to sing cover versions but, instead, he recorded six original songs in London, accompanied by James Ford and Bill Ryder-Jones. Two of the songs had already been written; Turner wrote the rest after watching dailies from the film set. The songs existed within the world of the film as a mixtape made by the main character's father. Paul Thompson of Pitchfork felt \"Turner's keen wit and eye for detail\" had created a \"tender portrayal\" of adolescent uncertainty.  Ben Walsh of The Independent said the \"exquisite\" soundtrack was \"reminiscent\" of Cat Stevens's work on Harold and Maude. In 2014, the Submarine soundtrack appeared on The Times's list of 100 Soundtracks to Love. Turner also co-wrote six songs for Miles Kane's debut solo album Colour of the Trap (2011) and co-wrote Kane's standalone single \"First of My Kind\" (2012).", "By 2012, Arctic Monkeys were based in Los Angeles, with Turner and Helders sharing a house.

They released \"R U Mine?\" as a standalone single in preparation for the tour, with Turner's new girlfriend, Arielle Vandenberg, appearing in the music video. Later that year, Arctic Monkeys performed \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" and a cover of \"Come Together\" by The Beatles at the 2012 London Summer Olympics opening ceremony.
