He became a check-weighman and secretary of the Bradford branch of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation. In 1894 he was elected to Manchester City Council as an Independent Labour Party councillor for the Bradford ward, an area previously represented by Conservatives.At the general election of January 1910 Sutton was elected as Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester East, the constituency that included the Bradford area. He held the seat until its abolition in 1918.\nAt the 1918 general election Sutton stood in the new seat of Manchester Clayton, losing to the Conservative, Edward Hopkinson. Hopkinson died in 1922, forcing a by-election, and Sutton was selected as Labour candidate. The Coalition Government was very unpopular due to high unemployment and severe cutbacks recommended by the Geddes Report, and Sutton easily won the seat. He lost the seat at the 1922 general election but regained it in 1923, and held it until 1931 when a large swing to the Conservatives was reflected in Clayton. William Flanagan, Sutton's opponent in the 1922 by-election took the seat. Sutton did not contest another parliamentary election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clayton, Manchester", "response": ["* John Edward Sutton"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|John Edward Sutton"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*John Edward Sutton, Manchester East, 1910\u201318; Manchester Clayton, 1922; 23\u201331"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Edward Sutton"]}, {"page": "Manchester East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Edward Sutton"]}, {"page": "List of close election results", "response": ["|Conservative Party candidate William Henry Flanagan defeated Labour Party candidate John Edward Sutton, 14,800\u201314,789.
