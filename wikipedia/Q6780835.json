As Mary Tiles writes:Mary Tiles (2004) The Philosophy of Set Theory, p. 99 [The] 'definition' of 'set' is less a definition than an attempt at explication of something which is being given the status of a primitive, undefined, term. As evidence, she quotes Felix Hausdorff: \"A set is formed by the grouping together of single objects into a whole. A set is a plurality thought of as a unit.\""]}, {"page": "Philosophy of mathematics", "response": ["Finitism is an extreme form of constructivism, according to which a mathematical object does not exist unless it can be constructed from natural numbers in a finite number of steps. In her book Philosophy of Set Theory, Mary Tiles characterized those who allow countably infinite objects as classical finitists, and those who deny even countably infinite objects as strict finitists."]}, {"page": "Finitism", "response": ["In her book The Philosophy of Set Theory, Mary Tiles characterized those who allow potentially infinite objects as classical finitists, and those who do not allow potentially infinite objects as strict finitists: for example, a classical finitist would allow statements such as \"every natural number has a successor\" and would accept the meaningfulness of infinite series in the sense of limits of finite partial sums, while a strict finitist would not. Historically, the written history of mathematics was thus classically finitist until Cantor created the hierarchy of transfinite cardinals at the end of the 19th century."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* Mary Tiles"]}, {"page": "List of women in mathematics", "response": ["* Mary Tiles (born 1946), writer on the philosophy and history of set theory"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy of science articles", "response": ["* Mary Tiles"]}, {"page": "The Man of Reason", "response": ["The Man of Reason received positive reviews from Naomi Scheman in The Women's Review of Books and K.
