In the early 660s, he expelled Ionan monks from the monastery of Ripon and gave it to Wilfrid, a Northumbrian churchman who had recently returned from Rome.  Alchfrith's position in the royal house, together with his promotion of Wilfrid (who would be the spokesperson for the Roman position at the synod), has contributed to the view that he was instrumental in arranging his father's convocation of the synod.Mayr-Harting, The Coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England, p. 108.", "In placing the synod in its proper historical context, Anglo-Saxon historians have also noted the position of the synod in the context of contemporary political tensions. Henry Mayr-Harting considered Alchfrith's interest in the convocation of the synod to be derived from his desire to see his father's position in Bernicia challenged and to see the replacement of Colm\u00e1n with another bishop who would be more aligned with himself."]}, {"page": "St Benet's Hall, Oxford", "response": ["*Henry Mayr-Harting; emeritus Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History, University of Oxford"]}, {"page": "Paulinus of York", "response": ["There is some difficulty with Bede's chronology on the date of \u00c6thelburh's marriage, as surviving papal letters to Edwin urging him to convert imply that Eadbald only recently had become a Christian, which conflicts with Bede's chronology.
