On the 20th of August 1887 it was the venue for one of the earliest cycle hill climbs, even though it was considered nearly impossible to complete due to the steep gradient of the then un-metalled road. Twenty-four competitors took part, using a variety of machines including penny-farthings, tricycles, and the new safety bicycles, all with solid tyres. Organised by the Catford Cycling Club, only half of the starters completed the climb. A rider of a penny-farthing came seventh. The winner was automobile pioneer Selwyn Francis Edge, using a safety bike, and celebrated deaf cyclist Arthur James Wilson finished 12th. Westerham was used for another sixteen of these hill climb events, as were a number of other Kent hills. The modern hill climb event is still run nearby at Yorks Hill."]}, {"page": "Road Records Association", "response": ["Arthur James Wilson, president of the North Road Cycling Club, convened a meeting in 1888 at which the Road Records Association was founded with the object of certifying the claims of male cyclists on the road, and setting standards for the timing and authentication of records.
