He was born at Taunton, Somerset and died at Yeovil, also in Somerset.\nSouthcombe was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. In his two first-class matches, he batted in the middle and lower order and he did not bowl. His highest score, and half of his aggregate for first-class runs, came in his very first innings, with a score of 10 in the match against Worcestershire at Yeovil in 1936.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Richard Southcombe (1936\u20131937) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "West Hendford Cricket Ground", "response": ["Somerset County Cricket Club played their first of five annual first-class matches on the ground in 1935. The match, against Surrey, was a significant event in the town, and a series of festivities were arranged to run alongside the three-day contest, including a dance and a smoking concert. Entry for the match, which took place from 17 to 19 August was one shilling, and attracted over 5,000 people, raising around \u00a3400. Surrey won the match by eight wickets. The takings from this match helped the Yeovil Cricket Club make further improvements to the ground, expanding it and adding further seating. The following year, Somerset played Worcestershire at the ground, in what the Western Gazette described as \"Yeovil Cricket Festival\". The captain of Yeovil Cricket Club, Richard Southcombe, was included in the Somerset team, which won the match by 170 runs. The takings were slightly lower than the previous year due to poor weather, but still described as \"gratifying\"."]}, {"page": "Southcombe, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Southcombe"]}, {"page": "Southcombe", "response": ["* Richard Southcombe (1909\u20131995), English cricketer for Somerset"]}]}}
