But Manager Kenny Jackett was determined to keep him at Millwall, which he did throughout the summer, and Trotter, himself, was keen to stay. At the start of the 2012\u201313 season, Trotter was given the captaincy in the absence of Danny Shittu and captained the side until November when Shittu returned from the sideline. He then scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20132 loss against Sheffield Wednesday on 25 August 2012, followed up by scoring against Middlesbrough, in a 3\u20131 win. Trotter then scored his third goal of the season, as well as, setting up one of the goal, in a 2\u20132 draw against Burnley on 29 September 2012. Three weeks later on 20 October 2012, he scored his fourth goal of the season against local rivals, Crystal Palace, in a 2\u20132 draw. Trotter then scored two goals in two matches once again this season between 27 October 2012 and 3 November 2012 against Huddersfield Town and Nottingham Forest. He continued to establish himself in the starting eleven for the side, playing in the midfield position and performed impressively since the start of the 2012\u201313 season. Trotter started in every match until he suffered an injury that saw him miss three matches in late\u2013November. It wasn't until on 8 December 2012 when Trotter returned from the starting line-up, in a 3\u20130 loss against Ipswich Town. In a follow\u2013up match against Leicester City, he set up a goal for Chris Taylor, to score the only goal in the game. However, in late\u2013February, he was dropped from the starting line-up for two matches by Manager Kenny Jackett, leading to speculation that the pair fallen out, which he dismissed the claim. Trotter returned to the first team, coming on as a substitute for Josh Wright in the 74th minute, in a 2\u20130 loss against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 5 March 2013. He then suffered a knee injury that kept him out for five matches at the beginning of April. It wasn't until on 30 April 2013 when he returned as a late substitute, in a 0\u20130 draw against local rivals, Crystal Palace.
