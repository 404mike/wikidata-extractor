A new Main Stand, to the south side of the ground, was opened on 1 January 1929. The Main Stand, which has the familiar Leitch style criss-cross balcony and a red-brick facade, seated 10,000 people and provided standing accommodation in an enclosure. Simon Inglis, a writer on football stadia, commented in 2005 that the Main Stand is Leitch's \"greatest work\" and is \"still resplendent today in its red brick glory under a modern mantle of glass and steel\". The architectural significance of the Main Stand was reflected when it became a Category B listed building in 1987. Original seats in the Main Stand were made of cast iron and oak. One was auctioned in 2011 for \u00a31,080.", "The Bill Struth Main Stand, formerly known as the Main Stand, faces onto Edmiston Drive (A8 road). The red-brick facade, designed by Archibald Leitch, is a Category B listed building. Simon Inglis, writing in 1996, described it as an \"imposing red-brick facade, with its mock neo-classical arched, square and pedimented windows, exudes prestige and power.\" On each end wall the club crest is depicted in a blue and gold mosaic. Stairtowers leading to the Club Deck (third tier) stand at each end of the Main Stand. These towers are also framed in red-brick, but deliberately contrast with the main body of the stand. The two stairtowers also support a  long and  truss, claimed to be the longest and heaviest clear span girder in the world."]}, {"page": "Villa Park", "response": ["As a result of inflation, 1919 quotes for the implementation of the pre-war construction plans came to \u00a366,000, compared to the 1914 quote of \u00a327,000. By March 1922 this price had reduced to \u00a341,775, and the directors pushed ahead with the plans for the new Trinity Road Stand.Inglis, Simon (1997) pp.112\u2013113 Construction began in April 1922 with the stand partially opened in August. Construction continued throughout the 1922\u20131923 season, with the stand officially opened on 26 January 1924 by the then Duke of York, later King George VI. He commented to Rinder that he had \"no idea that a ground so finely equipped in every way\u2014and devoted to football\u2014existed.\"Inglis, Simon (1997), p.118 On completion the Trinity Road Stand was considered one of the grandest in Britain, complete with stained glass windows, Italian mosaics, Dutch gables in the style of Aston Hall and a sweeping staircase. The Oak Room in the Trinity Road stand was the first restaurant at a British football ground. Several commentators including Simon Inglis consider it to be Leitch's masterpiece; a Sunday Times reporter described it in 1960 as the \"St Pancras of football.\" The final cost of the stand and associated 1922\u20131924 ground developments was calculated at \u00a389,000, a sum that enraged the club's directors who ordered an investigation into cost and in 1925 forced Rinder's resignation.Inglis, Simon (1997), pp.119\u2013122", "Villa Park remained in much the same state for another 30 years, with no major developments until the late 1950s. During the 1930s the earth and timber terraces with wooden crash barriers were completely replaced by concrete terracing and metal barriers, a process first begun by Rinder. In 1936 he was voted back onto the board at the age of 78 after the club were relegated to the Second Division. Nearly 25 years after he had created his 1914 masterplan, Rinder resurrected it and looked to carry out the third phase of his developments. He died in December 1938 (Leitch had died in April), leaving his construction business to his son, Archibald Junior. The complete redevelopment and extension of the Holte End began in early 1939, supervised by Archibald Junior. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, all construction across the country stopped. Unusually, given the austerity measures in place at the time, Villa acquired a special permit to continue construction of the Holte End; Simon Inglis notes \"How they achieved this is not recorded.\"Inglis, Simon (1997), pp.138\u2013139 Work on the ground was completed by April 1940, and the stand was immediately mothballed as Villa Park switched to its wartime role. The Trinity Road Stand became an air-raid shelter and ammunition store while the home dressing room became the temporary home of a rifle company from the 9th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment. German bombs caused \u00a320,000 worth of damage to the Witton Lane Stand, which was remedied by 1954.Inglis, Simon (1997), p.144", "The next development at Villa Park was the Trinity Road Stand in 2000. It had stood since 1922 and seen several renovations and additions. The demolition of the old stand began after the last game of the 1999\u20132000 season, an event met with an element of sadness from observers such as Simon Inglis who stated that \"the landscape of English football will never be the same.\" The new stand was larger than the old one, taking Villa's capacity from 39,399 to its present 42,785. It was officially opened in November 2001 by Prince Charles; his grandfather George VI had opened the old stand, 77 years earlier, when he was still the Duke of York."]}, {"page": "Valley Parade", "response": ["During the period from 1908 to 1985, the club carried out a number of other lesser work to the rest of the ground. It also included the introduction of floodlights in English football. Valley Parade's first floodlights cost \u00a33,000 and were lamps mounted on telegraph poles running along each side of the ground. They were originally used against Hull City on 20 December 1954. The floodlights were replaced in 1960 and again used for the first time against Hull City, but when one fell over in 1962, an FA Cup game with Gateshead had to go ahead with only three pylons, prompting an FA inquiry. In 1985, football ground writer Simon Inglis described the view from the main stand, which was still the same as when it was developed in 1908, as \"like watching football from the cockpit of a Sopwith Camel\" because of its antiquated supports and struts."]}, {"page": "Bradford City stadium fire", "response": ["Although there had been some changes to other parts of the ground, the main stand remained unaltered by 1985. Football ground writer Simon Inglis had described the view from the stand as \"like watching football from the cockpit of a Sopwith Camel\" because of its antiquated supports and struts. However, he also warned the club of a build-up of litter beneath the stand because of a gap between the seats. Some repair work was carried out, but in July 1984 the club was warned again, this time by a county council engineer, because of the club's plans to claim for ground improvements from the Football Trust. One letter from the council said the problems \"should be rectified as soon as possible\"; a second said: \"A carelessly discarded cigarette could give rise to a fire risk.\" In March 1985 the club's plans became more apparent when it took delivery of steel for a new roof."]}, {"page": "Sparkhill", "response": ["*Simon Inglis, Architectural historian, writer and broadcaster."]}, {"page": "Carrow Road", "response": ["The new stadium was described by club officials as \"the largest construction job in the city since the building of Norwich Castle\", \"miraculously built in just 82 days\" and \"the eighth wonder of the world\". An aerial photograph from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing, and a covered stand  with a Colman's Mustard advertisement painted on its roof, visible only from the air. The club's association with Colman's has continued into the modern era; in 1997 the club signed a shirt sponsorship deal with the company. The mustard manufacturer's original factory was located adjacent to the stadium in Carrow Road, and the ground was opened by Russell Colman, the President of the club. The author Simon Inglis describes the early Carrow Road as comprising \"a Main Stand, a covered end terrace and two large open banks\". The covered terrace was paid for by Captain Evelyn Barclay, the vice-president of Norwich City; it was constructed in time for the opening of the 1937\u201338 season, and while the original construction is long gone, the end retains the name of its benefactor."]}, {"page": "Bootham Crescent", "response": ["The ground is located just over a mile from York railway station, which is approximately a 20-minute walk. The station lies on the East Coast Main Line between London King's Cross railway station and Edinburgh Waverley railway station, and has direct services from Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and South West England. Many of the roads near the ground are for residential permit holders only, meaning car parking at the ground is notoriously difficult. The author Simon Inglis pointed out the irony of the club leaving Fulfordgate because of its location, when \"it is harder than ever for fans to drive in to Bootham Crescent\". Parking on matchdays at nearby York Hospital is available. A park and ride facility operates in the city, and a number of lines drop off within walking distance of the ground."]}, {"page": "The Oval (Belfast)", "response": ["The stadium's capacity is 26,556, but was estimated in 2010 by the Northern Ireland Assembly to have a safe capacity of 5,056 under safety legislation.Northern Ireland Assembly Answer to Written Question AQW1178/11 However, since 2011, the safe capacity permitted by Health and Safety authorities is 5,300; before 2010 the stadium could hold more than 8,000. Linfield's manager David Jeffrey criticised these restrictions and said that they were \"murdering local football.\" The main stand holds 2,720 and the Railway stand holds 2,070.

In 1992, 17-year-old apprentice footballer Ben Lee was killed when he fell through the roof of the ageing Longside terrace as he tried to retrieve a football during training.

He had visualised its eventual appearance from a number of sketches he had made and passed on to well-established architects of the day, E B Holmes and later Archibald Leitch. Detailed plans were drawn up in 1914 for the development of the ground to hold 120,000 people, but the World War One meant that the plan was only partly realised after the war, with the Trinity Road stand being opened to the public in 1923. The Oak Room in the Trinity Road stand was the first restaurant at a British football ground."]}]}}
