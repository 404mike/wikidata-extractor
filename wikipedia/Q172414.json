He was closely associated with the Cooper Car Company, and was instrumental in the early development of the company.\nWhen he and his boyhood friend John Cooper were released from military service after World War II they built two cars to the new National 500 cc (30.5 cu in) regulations. Brandon, whose family business was electrical goods, had access to BTH magnetos for the JAP engines, which Cooper's father Charlie then acquired. Brandon entered his Cooper in numerous hillclimbs and sprints and in 1947, at Gransden Lodge airfield, he won Britain's first-ever 500 cc circuit race. He also won the first Formula Three title, in 1951.Later in the 1950s Brandon entered five World Championship Grands Prix in larger, Formula Two Cooper-Bristols, but failed to score any Championship points. For much of his career Brandon raced for the Ecurie Richmond team, which he formed with Alan Brown. In 1955 he funded the construction of his own Halseylec sports car, named after his electrical supplies company. He continued to compete in cars until 1956, but had become increasingly involved in hydroplane racing and by 1957 had devoted himself entirely to this outlet for his competitive spirit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 8", "response": ["*1982 \u2013 Eric Brandon, English racing driver and businessman (b. 1920)"]}, {"page": "July 18", "response": ["*1920 \u2013 Eric Brandon, English race car driver and businessman (d. 1982)"]}, {"page": "Cooper Car Company", "response": ["The Cooper Car Company is a British car manufacturer founded in December 1947Wright, Terry; Power Without Glory: Racing the Big-twin Cooper, Loose Fillings Sydney 2015.

Together with John's boyhood friend, Eric Brandon, they began by building racing cars in Charles's small garage in Surbiton, Surrey, England, in 1946. Through the 1950s and early 1960s they reached motor racing's highest levels as their rear-engined, single-seat cars competed in both Formula One and the Indianapolis 500, and their Mini Cooper dominated rally racing.  The Cooper name lives on in the Cooper versions of the Mini production cars that are built in England, but is now owned and marketed by BMW.", "The first cars built by the Coopers were single-seat 500-cc Formula Three racing cars driven by John Cooper and Eric Brandon, and powered by a JAP motorcycle engine. Since materials were in short supply immediately after World War II, the prototypes were constructed by joining two old Fiat Topolino front-ends together. According to John Cooper, the stroke of genius that would make the Coopers an automotive legend\u2014the location of the engine behind the driver\u2014was merely a practical matter at the time. As the car was powered by a motorcycle engine, they believed it was more convenient to have the engine in the back, driving a chain. In fact there was nothing new about 'mid' engined racing cars but there is no doubt Coopers led the way in popularising what was to become the dominant arrangement for racing cars."]}, {"page": "Formula Three", "response": ["Formula Three (adopted by the FIA in 1950) evolved from postwar auto racing, with lightweight tube-frame chassis powered by 500 cc motorcycle engines (notably Nortons and JAP speedway). The 500 cc formula originally evolved in 1946 from low-cost \"special\" racing organised by enthusiasts in Bristol,  England, just before the Second World War; British motorsport after the war picked up slowly, partly due to petrol rationing which continued for a number of years and home-built 500 cc cars engines were intended to be accessible to the \"impecunious enthusiast\". The second post-war motor race in Britain was organised by the VSCC in July 1947 at RAF Gransden Lodge, 500cc cars being the only post-war class to run that day. Three of the seven entrants were non-starters, and, of the four runners, all but one retired on the first lap, leaving Eric Brandon in his Cooper Prototype (T2) trailing round to a virtual walk-over at an average speed of 55.79\u00a0mph, though his best lap (which was the fastest recorded for any 500) was 65.38\u00a0mph."]}, {"page": "1952 Swiss Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Eric Brandon", "|  Eric Brandon", "|  Eric Brandon"]}, {"page": "1952 Belgian Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Eric Brandon", "|  Eric Brandon", "|  Eric Brandon"]}, {"page": "1952 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Eric Brandon", "|  Eric Brandon", "|  Eric Brandon"]}, {"page": "1952 Italian Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Eric Brandon", "|  Eric Brandon", "|  Eric Brandon"]}, {"page": "1954 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Eric Brandon", ": \u2014 Rodney Nuckey, named substitute driver for Eric Brandon in the #30 Cooper-Bristol, was given a starting position despite not completing a single lap in qualifying or in the race.", "|  Eric Brandon"]}, {"page": "1954 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Eric Brandon", "|align=\"left\"|  Eric Brandon"]}, {"page": "1952 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Eric Brandon", "|align=\"left\"|  Eric Brandon"]}, {"page": "Alan Brown (racing driver)", "response": ["Alan Everest Brown (born in Malton, Yorkshire, 20 November 1919 \u2013 died in Guildford, Surrey, 20 January 2004) was a British racing driver from England.
