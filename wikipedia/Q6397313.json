Allardyce was eventually allowed to spend \u00a350,000 on striker Kevin Rapley, who helped the club to steer clear of relegation at the end of the 1998\u201399 campaign.

Heffernan won the \"Young Player of the Year\" in 2002\u201303 scoring 10 goals from 25 matches. Then, in the 2003\u201304 season, Heffernan scored two hat-tricks of his career: The first was in a game against Queens Park Rangers in a 3\u20133 draw on 26 December 2003 and the second was in a game against Stockport County, where he scored four times, in a 4\u20131 win on 21 February 2004. Shortly after this, Heffernan rejected a two-and-a-half-year deal on improved terms with the club, whose contract expires at the end of the 2003\u201304 season. His rejection of a new contract attracted interests from four clubs after confirming the previous day that he walking out the club following their relegation.
