They had six children including the pathologist , the doctor Arthur Gabriel Salaman, the engineer Raphael Salaman, the artist Ruth Collet and the singer . They settled in the country, in the village of Barley in Hertfordshire, where they lived with their six children (one of whom died in childhood). Nina Salaman continued to pursue her interest in medieval Hebrew poetry. Despite Barley's distance from London, she maintained a kosher home and Sabbath observance. For the festivals, the family traveled to London, where they stayed with one of Redcliffe's siblings and attended the New West End Synagogue. She took personal responsibility for the Hebrew education of her children until they left for boarding school."]}, {"page": "Salaman", "response": ["*Raphael Salaman, FSA (1906\u20131993), English engineer, collector of hand tools and writer"]}, {"page": "Raphael Arthur Salaman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Raphael Salaman"]}]}}
