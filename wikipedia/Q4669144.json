Educated at Archbishop Tenison's Library School, he was apprenticed to the engraver J. Hall from 1789 to 1796. For nine years, part of his working-time was devoted to the study of drawing in the Royal Academy and to carrying out occasional engravings for the booksellers, whilst his leisure hours were employed in painting portraits in miniature. Having formed an intimacy with Sir David Wilkie, Raimbach in 1812 began to engrave some of Wilkie's best pictures. At his death, he held a gold medal awarded for his Village Politicians at the Paris Exhibition of 1814. He was elected corresponding member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in 1835.He is buried in St Mary's Churchyard, Hendon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cecil Court", "response": ["*In 1776, Abraham Raimbach, the line engraver of \"Village Politicians\", \"Blind Man's Buff\", and others, after David Wilkie, was born in Cecil Court.

The painterly quality which distinguished the 18th-century mezzotints on copper was wanting in his later works, because the hardness of the steel on which they were engraved impaired freedom of execution and richness of tone, and so enhanced the labor of scraping that he accelerated the work by stipple, etching the details instead of scraping them out of the ground in the manner of his predecessors. To this mixed style, previously used by Richard Earlom on copper, Cousins added heavy roulette and rocking-tool textures, tending to fortify the darks, when he found that the burr even on steel failed to yield enough fine impressions to meet high demand. The effect of his prints in this method after Reynolds and Millais was mechanical and out of harmony with the picturesque technique of these painters, but the phenomenal popularity which Cousins gained for his works at least kept alive and in favor a form of mezzotint engraving during a critical phase of its history. Abraham Raimbach, the line engraver, dated the decline of his own art in England from the appearance in 1837 of Cousins's print (in the mixed style) after Landseer's Bolton Abbey. Such plates as Miss Peel, after Lawrence (published in 1833); A Midsummer Nights Dream, after Landseer (1857); The Order of Release and The First Minuet, after Millais (1856 and 1868); The Strawberry Girl and Lavinia, Countess Spencer, after Reynolds; and Miss Rich, after Hogarth (1873-1877), represent various stages of Cousins's mixed method. It reached its final development in the plates after Millais's Cherry Ripe and Pomona, published in 1881 and 1882, when the invention of facing copper-plates with a film of steel to make them yield larger editions led to the revival of pure mezzotint on copper, which rendered obsolete the steel plate and the mixed style which it fostered. The fine draughtsmanship of Cousins was as apparent in his prints as in his original lead-pencil portraits exhibited in London in 1882."]}, {"page": "1843 in art", "response": ["* January 17 \u2013 Abraham Raimbach, English engraver (born 1776)"]}, {"page": "1776 in art", "response": ["* February 16 \u2013 Abraham Raimbach, English engraver (died 1843)"]}, {"page": "1776", "response": ["* February 16 \u2013 Abraham Raimbach, British engraver (d. 1843)"]}, {"page": "1776 in Great Britain", "response": ["* 16 February \u2013 Abraham Raimbach, engraver (died 1843)"]}, {"page": "Raimbach", "response": ["#redirect Abraham Raimbach"]}, {"page": "Abraham f", "response": ["#REDIRECT Abraham Raimbach "]}, {"page": "Luke Clennell", "response": ["Clennell was born in Ulgham near Morpeth, Northumberland, the son of a farmer.

His first venture was an edition of Charles Jervas's translation of Don Quixote (1801). Having been successful in this, he published some lesser works of less importance, while he was preparing for the press a new translation, from the French of Antoine Galland, of the Arabian Nights (1802), with twenty-four engravings from pictures by Robert Smirke, R.A. During the same year he brought out an edition of Anacreon, for which William Bulmer furnished a Greek font; the title-plates and vignettes were by Lavinia Forster. Editions of dramatic authors followed, under the titles of British Drama, New British Theatre, and English Drama. An edition of Rasselas, with engravings by Abraham Raimbach from pictures painted by Smirke, was issued by Forster in 1805; it was followed in 1809 by a small privately printed volume of verse, entitled Occasional Amusements, which appeared without his name."]}, {"page": "St Mary's Churchyard, Hendon", "response": ["According to a history of Hendon published in 1890, the earliest surviving grave is that of Thomas Marsh dated 1624.

When the July Revolution began, he moved to London, continuing his studies with Abraham Raimbach and John Henry Robinson. In 1834, he settled in Rome where, at the urging of Karl Briullov, he produced a huge engraving of the \"Transfiguration\" by Raphael, which took him twelve (some sources say fifteen) years to complete. As a result of this work, he became an honorary member of the Academy of Arts, Berlin and the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence. He was named an Academician by the Imperial Academy in 1844 and was awarded the title of Professor in 1850, when he returned to Saint Petersburg."]}]}}
