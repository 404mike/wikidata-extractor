In his second season, Evans guided Blackpool to the Division Two championship (their only championship to date), finishing ahead of promotion rivals Chelsea and Oldham Athletic by three and four points respectively.  Hampson had bagged 45 of the club's 98 league goals.", "The club's relegation prompted the Blackpool board to install a recognised manager, and they opted for Sandy MacFarlane. MacFarlane occupied the Bloomfield Road hot seat for just two seasons, in which the club finished 11th and fourth.

On 10 April 1926 a record attendance of 14,143 at Seedhill, saw a 2\u20132 draw with Bradford Park Avenue. For a town with a population of under 40,000 the attendance were considered impressive. They reached the second round of the FA Cup in 1926\u201327, beating Stockport County at home 4\u20131 in the first round, before losing 2\u20131 away to Ashington in the second round. That season they finished 5th, however the club then started to struggle in the league and finished in last place in 1927\u201328, conceding 135 goals, and they were also struggling financially and found themselves \u00a36,500 in debt. They were though re-elected to the league. In 1930\u201331 they reached the second round of the FA Cup for a second time. In the first round they beat Workington 4\u20130 then lost 2\u20131 to York City in a replay after a 1\u20131 draw. However, they again struggled in the league, dropping to last place on Boxing Day 1930, where they stayed for the rest of the season. After finishing bottom of the league for a second time, they failed to win re-election and were voted out of the Football League after a second vote, following a tie. They were replaced by Chester City. The club's last game in the Football League was a 4\u20130 defeat to Hull City on 2 May 1931. The club then dropped back into the Lancashire Combination where on 7 August 1936 they folded again after incurring a big loss. Hastily reformed as Nelson Town, the \"new\" club entered the local Nelson & Colne League in time for the 1936\u20137 season and duly lost their first fixture at Seedhill against James Nelson SC 3\u20132. After completing two seasons in local football the club announced after their final game at Gargrave in 1939 that the following season would see them return to senior football in the West Lancashire League. Sadly only two games were played before events in Europe dictated a seven-year absence of League football in Nelson."]}]}}
