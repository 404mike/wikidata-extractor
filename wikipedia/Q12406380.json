On 2 May, the commander at RAF Habbaniya, Air Vice-Marshal Harry George Smart, responded to the Iraqi demands by launching a pre-emptive strike against the Iraqi forces overlooking the air base. This action initiated the Anglo-Iraqi War. Within a week, the Iraqis abandoned the escarpment. By mid-May, British forces consisting mainly of Assyrian levies from Habbaniya had moved on to Fallujah and, after overcoming Iraqi resistance there, moved on to Baghdad. On 29 May, as British troops were closing in on his position, Gaylani fled to Iran. Before he left Baghdad, Gaylani contacted Mulla Effendi and informed him that he had chosen his house as a safe haven for the royal family to stay until the conflict ended."]}, {"page": "Reggie", "response": ["* Nickname of Harry George Smart (1891-1963), British vice air marshal"]}, {"page": "Anglo-Iraqi War", "response": ["After 1937, no British troops were left in Iraq and the government had become solely responsible for internal security.Playfair 1956, p. 177.
