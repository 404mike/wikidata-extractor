He was born on 18 October 1903 and was the only child of A. McFarlane, OBE. His father was a civil servant in the Admiralty and the young McFarlane's childhood was an unhappy one. This may have led to the deep melancholy that seemed to pervade much of his adult life. His family sent him to public school at Dulwich College as a day-boy. McFarlane did not particularly like the atmosphere of the public school. In 1922 he earned a scholarship to read history at Exeter College, Oxford. His tutor during these years was C. T. Atkinson. Following the completion of his DPhil on the loans of Cardinal Beaufort to the English Crown (September 1927), McFarlane became a fellow of Magdalen College, where he remained for the rest of his life. Many of his colleagues and students found him difficult to approach, but to those who could break through the facade he became a great and true friend. McFarlane also found, through the help of his great friend Helena Wright and her family, a home and a family of sorts. In Wright's house he found that he could be himself and find refuge from the daily grind of the University and a place of joy. McFarlane never married.\nHis most important contribution to the field was his revision of the understanding of late medieval feudal relationships, known as \"bastard feudalism\". The old consensus, promoted primarily by Bishop Stubbs, was that payment for service in feudal relationships had promoted greed and civil strife. McFarlane, however, pointed out the adhesive effect of such a system, and other forms of patronage, as a field of common interest for the Crown and the landed aristocracy. According to Christine Carpenter in \"Wars of the Roses \u2013 Politics and the constitution in England c. 1473\u20131509\" (Cambridge University Press 1997): \"It is hard to exaggerate the impact of McFarlane's work, especially at Oxford where he taught. A whole generation of students there was inspired to work on what had been a very neglected century; nearly all the political historians of fourteenth and fifteenth century England today, including the present writer, are, academically speaking, the children or grandchildren, even great grandchildren, of McFarlane\". She also described him as being responsible for a \"paradigm shift\". In more recent debate, it has been pointed out that McFarlane created a \"paradoxical metaphor \u2013 the image of a polluted, dirty, as it were contaminated phenomenon \u2013 of the feudalism\" which led to follow-up terms as it was a late-medieval \"bastard urbanism\" (a term invented by 19th century historians to characterize feudalism as it took form in the Late Middle Ages, foremost in England).While house-hunting before retirement he was \"ambushed by a stroke which killed him instantly\".Although his scholarship and methods have had great influence on later historians, McFarlane did not publish widely in his own lifetime. The main sources for his scholarship are the book Lancastrian Kings and Lollard Knights, his Ford Lectures from 1953 published in 1980 as The Nobility of Later Medieval England, and the essays and shorter articles published by his student G. L. Harriss in 1981 under the title England in the Fifteenth Century. Much of his influence on historiography is the result of his DPhil students, who held posts in many British universities.Letters to Friends, 1940\u20131966, edited by G. L. Harriss, contains a selection from the large collection of correspondence deposited with Magdalen College and published privately through the college in 1997. The great bulk of McFarlane's correspondence remains unpublished.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*K. B. McFarlane (1903\u20131966), English medievalist"]}, {"page": "Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham", "response": ["Stafford's mother's death in 1438 transformed his fiscal position. He now received the remainder of his father's estates\u2014worth about \u00a31,500\u2014and his mother's half of the de Bohun inheritance, which was worth another \u00a31,200. The latter also included the earldom of Buckingham, worth \u00a31,000 on its own; Stafford had become one of the greatest landowners in England overnight. \"His landed resources matched his titles\", explained Albert Compton-Reves, scattered as they were throughout England, Wales and Ireland, with only the King and Richard, Duke of York wealthier. One assessment of his estates suggests that, by the late 1440s, his income was over \u00a35,000 per annum, and K. B. McFarlane estimated Stafford's total potential income from land to have been \u00a36,300 gross annually, at its peak between 1447 and 1448. On the other hand, the actual yield may have been lower; around \u00a33,700: rents, for example, were often difficult to collect. Even a lord of the status of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, owed Stafford over \u00a3100 in unpaid rent for the manor of Drayton Bassett in 1458. In the 1440s and 1450s, Stafford's Welsh estates were particularly notable for both their rent arrears and public disorder. Further\u2014and like most nobles of the period\u2014he substantially overspent, possibly, says Harriss, by as much as \u00a3300 a year. His treasurer, William Wistowe, when rendering his accounts for the years 1452\u20131453, noted that Stafford was owed \u00a3730 by his reckoning, some debts being 20 years old. Despite this, says Woolgar, \"there [is] no suggestion that [Stafford] found it difficult to obtain cash or goods\".", "The Yorkists realised what Buckingham\u2014\"prevaricating with courtesy\", says Armstrong\u2014was trying to do and battle commenced while negotiations were still taking place: Richard, Earl of Warwick, launched a surprise attack at around ten o'clock in the morning. Buckingham commanded the King's army of 2,500 men, although his coordination of the town's defence was problematic, giving the initiative to the Yorkists. Although the defences that Buckingham had organised successfully checked the Yorkists' initial advance, Warwick took his force through gardens and houses to attack the Lancastrians in the rear. The battle was soon over, and had lasted between half an hour and an hour with only about 50 casualties. They included senior Lancastrian captains: Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Clifford had all been killed. Buckingham himself was wounded three times in the face by arrows\u2014and sought sanctuary in the abbey. His son appears to have been badly wounded. A chronicler reported that some Yorkist soldiers, intent on looting, entered the abbey to kill Buckingham, but that the Duke was saved by York's personal intervention. In any case, says Harriss, Buckingham was probably captured with the King, although he was still able to reward ninety of his retainers from Kent, Sussex and Surrey. It is not known for certain whether these men had actually fought with him at St Albans; as K. B. McFarlane points out, many retinues did not arrive in time to fight."]}, {"page": "William Stubbs", "response": ["In the main Stubbs' ideas of a confrontational political framework have been superseded by K. B. McFarlane's \"community of interest\" theory; the idea that the amount of possible conflict between a king and his nobles was actually very small (case in point, Henry IV, 1399\u20131413).

B. McFarlane showed that Fastolf made large sums of money in France, which he managed to transfer back to England and invest in land and property. At the time, his reputation was mixed. One servant wrote of him: \"cruel and vengible he hath been ever, and for the most part without pity and mercy\" (Paston Letters, i. 389); and this remark has become famous because it was recorded in the letter. Besides his share in his wife's property he had large estates in Norfolk and Suffolk, a house at Southwark in London and where he also owned the Boar's Head Inn. The site of his house at Southwark, known as Fastolf Place or Palace, was excavated in the 1990s, but only a few pieces of revetment were found."]}, {"page": "Bastard feudalism", "response": ["In the 1940s K. B. McFarlane presented a strong challenge to the ideas of Stubbs.  McFarlane stripped the term \"bastard feudalism\" of any negative connotation.  To him, bastard feudalism centred not on the financial aspect (the sums involved were mostly negligible) but on the concept of service in exchange for good favour.  In a society governed on a personal basis, service to a lord was the best way to obtain favour in the form of offices, grants, etc.  Lords would retain administrators and lawyers, as well as recruiting local gentry into their affinities.  By offering money instead of land, lords could afford to retain more followers."]}, {"page": "KB. McFarlane", "response": ["#REDIRECT K. B.

More recently, the historian K. B. McFarlane has gone further, arguing that it was probably \"apocryphal\", and J. R. Lander calls it \"very dubious indeed\". James Ross has pointed out that Clifford was pardoned by EdwardIV in 1472 and could hardly have been in danger from the King thereafter. Further, he notes, as early as 1466 Clifford was named publicly as receiving a bequest of a sword and a silver bowl by Henry Harlington of Craven. This argues that the young lord could not have been difficult to find, comments Ross. He also, though, suggests that Clifford may well have kept a low profile after Towton, if only temporarily: \"it may not have been with a shepherd, but surely Clifford was in hiding in secret somewhere\". Malay also suggests that \"in all likelihood, he spent only a few years in rural retreat\" in Cumberland. Clifford's biographer Henry Summerson, writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, also refutes the theory, \"later stories to the contrary notwithstanding, that the seven-year-old Henry Clifford was ever pursued by vengeful Yorkists\". Summerson notes, for example, that Hall wrote that Clifford\u2014due to his upbringing by remote shepherds\u2014was illiterate. In reality, says Summerson, Clifford \"was later to be not just literate but even bookish, owning volumes on law and medicine\". Summerson agrees that \"it may be that the Clifford heir thought it prudent to keep a low profile\" in the early years of the new regime. While the medievalist Vivienne Rock subscribes to the theory that Clifford grew up ill-educated, she agrees that in later life \"he did become an able administrator for his substantial estates\"."]}, {"page": "Michael Hicks (historian)", "response": ["Hicks studied under Charles Ross while a final-year undergraduate student at the University of Bristol (1969\u201370),Hicks.

In late April 1469 a large body of dissidents gathered under the leadership of one Robin of Redesdale in Yorkshire; however, Warwick's brother, John Neville, appears to have dispersed them with little trouble. Almost immediately, however, there was another, separate but larger gathering in the East Riding of Yorkshire, this time led by one Robin of Holderness. This rebellion may have been in support of the Percy family's traditional claim to the earldom of Northumberland; this group, too, was scattered by John Neville, and its leader beheaded in York. In the meantime, the remnants of Robin of Redesdale's original force had regrouped and re-emerged in Lancashire; this rising, at least, is generally considered by historians to have almost certainly been a Warwick construct. In any case, it gathered a large army around it, and included many retainers and men otherwise connected to the Neville family in Yorkshire, including Sir John Conyers, the son of Lord FitzHugh, and the Nevilles' own cousin, Sir Henry Neville; indeed it contained three Neville brothers-in-law.Gillingham, J., The Wars of the Roses (London (repr.) 1980), 192."]}, {"page": "Wars of the Roses", "response": ["Some historians question the impact the wars had on the fabric of English society and culture; revisionists, such as the Oxford historian K. B. McFarlane, suggests that the effects of the conflict were greatly exaggerated. Many parts of England were largely unaffected by the wars, particularly East Anglia. In the densely populated regions of the country, both factions had far more to lose by the ruin of the country through protracted sieges and pillaging, and sought a quick resolution to the conflict through a pitched battle; sieges that did occur, such as at Harlech and Bamburgh were in comparatively remote and sparsely populated areas. Contemporaries such as Philippe de Commines observed in 1470 that England was a unique case compared to wars that befell the continent, in that the consequences of war were only visited upon soldiers and nobles, not citizens and private property.Wise & Embleton, p. 4 Many areas undertook little effort to improve their defences; city walls were either left in prior ruinous states or only partially rebuilt, as was the case in London, whereby the citizenry were able to avoid devastation by persuading the Yorkist and Lancastrian troops to stay out, after the inability to reconstruct adequate walls, thereby rendering the city indefensible. Few noble houses were extinguished entirely by the wars; between 1425\u20131449, prior to the outbreak of fighting, there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes (25), as occurred between 1450\u20131474 (24), during the heaviest period of combat.Terence Wise and G.A. Embleton, The Wars of the Roses, Osprey Men-at-Arms series, p. 4, from K.B. MacFarlane, The Nobility of Later Medieval England, Oxford University Press However, several preeminent noble families had their power crippled because of the fighting, such as the Neville family, while the direct male line of the Plantagenet dynasty was rendered extinct. Despite the relative paucity of violence undertaken against civilians, the wars claimed the lives of 105,000 people, approximately 5.5% of the population level in 1450, though by 1490 England had experienced a 12.6% increase in population levels compared to 1450, despite the wars.S.
