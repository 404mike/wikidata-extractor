Based in Bristol, he is a co-founder of the website irational.org, and was one of the early practitioners in the 1990s of Net.art. Bunting's work is based on creating open and democratic systems by modifying communications technologies and social systems. His work often explores the porosity of borders, both in physical space and online. In 1997, his online work Visitors Guide to London was included in the 10th documenta curated by Swiss curator Simon Lamuni\u00e8re.\nAn activist, he created a dummy site for the European Lab for Network Collision (CERN).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Net.art", "response": ["net.art refers to a group of artists who have worked in the medium of Internet art since 1994.

The aim of the action was to pay attention to spaces, which had been closed, fenced-off and privatised. The performances were realised by different artist, including: Folke K\u00f6bberling, Martin Kaltwasser in co-operation with Heath Bunting (they built and crossed the artificial walls). San Keller's \"Wolf\u2019s Choir\" received wide attention setting up a debate on gated communities and their influence on public space in Poland. The third edition, in 2009, presented artistic answers to the question of how to manage the financial crisis \u2013 \"Money for Nothing: Manifesto\" for a time of crisis. For example, Roland Schefferski in the name of a potlatch of ideas dropped tokens (which looked like coins) around the city, with the idea that people could collect and exchange them for ideas. For the fourth edition, in 2012, the foundation organised balcony-concerts with alternative music. Concerts took place on Mokotowska Street in a very special place in the city, also known as \u201cThe Warsaw Smile\u201d because its layout on a map looks like a smile. Accompanying the festival, there was extraordinary photography exhibitions of Warsaw before 1939 in shops and caf\u00e9 house windows.http://independent.pl/w/48282 9 January 2013"]}, {"page": "Ivan Pope", "response": ["Pope and internet artist Heath Bunting planned to open London's first cybercafe in 1994, although were beaten to it by Cyberia.
