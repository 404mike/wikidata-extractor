Two fractious FA Cup ties, including one in which Derby came from 2\u20130 down to win 3\u20132 and win at the City Ground for the first time since 1971, did not help matters and Robbie Savage's post-match scarf waving did not endear him to the Forest support.

Many of the departing players were high-wage earning flops from the Billy Davies/Paul Jewell-era, (such as Claude Davis, Roy Carroll and Martin Albrechtsen) many of whose contracts were cancelled by mutual consent as the club tried to reign in its spiraling wage bill.

Although the club never fell into the bottom three during the campaign (the lowest position was 20th) it spent just six fixtures in the top half of the table, only one of which was achieved after August. A lack of consistency was one reason; not only in results (the club never recording more than two consecutive victories) but also in the club's inability to field a consistent team selection. A club record 40 players represented the club, with only 6 players making 30 or more league starts. Injuries also played a significant role; one match, away to Ipswich Town in October, came at the height of the club's injury problems and saw them unable to even name a full complement of substitutes such was the lack of players available. A purple patch of form in February saw the club end local rivals Nottingham Forest's 19 match unbeaten run, inflict eventual-Champions Newcastle United's biggest defeat of the season (3\u20130) and hit five in a match for the first time in three years when they edged out Preston North End 5\u20133 at Pride Park, before a run of just three wins in twelve through the end of February until the end of April, ensured that safety was not achieved until the 44th fixture of the season after a 1\u20131 draw at home to relegation rivals Crystal Palace.

Dean Leacock, heavily criticised as \"offering nothing\" the previous game, was dropped to the bench, and Stephen Pearson, Conor Doyle and a returning Robbie Savage introduced into the midfield. Two enforced changes came with Gareth Roberts replacing the suspended Dean Moxey and Chris Porter making his first start of the league campaign as a replacement for Luke Moore, who returned to W.B.A. on the completion of his three-month loan. In the event, the changes earned Derby a first win in 6 as a Porter double sealed a 2\u20131 win at the division's bottom club.

The return of just seven points from the last nine fixtures was beginning to affect attendances, with just 24,239 attending the Millwall draw, the lowest attendance for a league match at Pride Park Stadium for almost four years, when just 23,122 attended an evening kick-off victory against Burnley on Tuesday 30 January. It was the third time in the 2010\u201311 campaign that attendances had dipped below 25,000 for a league fixture, something which had previously nor occurred since the said fixture against Burnley. The numbers, plus the nature of the support, led captain Robbie Savage to criticise the club's support, saying \"What you want them to do when we are not playing well is get behind us. It's as if they're waiting for a mistake to get on our backs.\" However, the club's slight revival was undermined by a giant killing at the hands of non-league Crawley in the FA Cup third round, described by reporters as one of the \"biggest FA Cup shocks of all time\" and others as the most \"humiliating result in Derby County's history\".

Clough stated the bid's acceptance was football, rather than financially related, explaining \"He (Moxey) has not really progressed this season as much as we hoped. We just thought it was a good offer. We have got another good left back in Gareth Roberts and we can always get cover in on loan if we need it.\" Other departures saw Medi Abalimba, whose contract at Derby was terminated but the club held onto his registration, join Oldham Athletic on a free and the young trio of Graham Kelly, Mitchell Hanson and Kallum Keane had their contracts canceled five months early by mutual consent.

There was also pressure on Clough, who was criticised by PFA Chief Gordon Taylor after comments he made about Tomasz Cwyka following a 1\u20131 draw at Portsmouth. Of Cywka, Clough said \"He's an extremely inexperienced and not very bright footballer\u00a0... he can go back to Wigan or wherever he came from \u2013 I'm not really bothered \u2013 until he learns the game.\" This led Taylor to state that \"It cannot be appropriate to criticise your team in such a way in public.
