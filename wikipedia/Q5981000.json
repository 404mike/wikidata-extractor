Kidderminster made him club captain, and of his first 30 games for the club they lost only one; at the end of the season the club were promoted to the Football League as Conference champions. They repaid the insurance payout that Clarkson had received on his retirement due to injury, so that he was able to play for them in the Football League. When Jan Molby resigned as manager of Kidderminster in March 2002, Clarkson acted as assistant to caretaker manager Ian Britton. The club released him at the end of that season for financial reasons. He joined Nuneaton Borough of the Conference, and was released in December again on financial grounds. He then registered for short periods with Stafford Rangers, Leamington and, from March 2003, Forest Green Rovers, finally retiring at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Ian Britton", "response": ["Ian Britton may refer to:", "*Ian Britton (English footballer) (born 1956),  English former football player and manager and current rugby union coach", "*Ian Britton (Scottish footballer) (1954\u20132016), Scottish footballer who played in midfield"]}, {"page": "Britton (surname)", "response": ["* Ian Britton (English footballer) (born 1956), English footballer", "* Ian Britton (Scottish footballer) (1954\u20132016), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Football League Third Division Manager of the Month", "response": ["| Ian Britton"]}]}}
