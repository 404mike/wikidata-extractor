He broke through to the first-team in April 2002 in a 2\u20130 Premiership defeat to Arsenal. After establishing himself as a regular during the 2002\u201303 season, Ambrose was sold to Newcastle United for \u00a31 million. He made over 50 appearances for Newcastle before joining Charlton Athletic in 2005 for \u00a31.5 million. A four-year stay at The Valley saw Ambrose make over 120 appearances, while he also spent time away on loan at his former club Ipswich in the latter stages of his spell with the Addicks. He joined Crystal Palace on a free transfer ahead of the 2009\u201310 season, making 110 league appearances in three seasons. He signed for Birmingham City for a \u00a3250,000 fee in 2012, spending two seasons with the Championship club, but failed to establish himself in the first-team. He was loaned to Greek Superleague side Apollon Smyrni in January 2014, where he scored six goals in eleven outings. Ambrose was released by Birmingham in the summer of 2014, before he rejoined Ipswich on a permanent basis following a trial. He made just eight appearances for his boyhood club before being released the following summer. Ambrose then signed a one-year contract with League One club Colchester United in August 2015.\nAmbrose has represented England at under-20 and under-21 level, scoring two goals in ten appearances between 2003 and 2006 for the under-21s, and scoring one goal in four games for the under-20s at the 2005 Toulon Tournament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marcus Bent", "response": ["Despite Bent scoring nine times in 22 league starts, the Blues were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2001\u201302 season. He stayed at Portman Road for the 2002\u201303 campaign, hitting 12 goals in 38 games, as the Tractor Boys missed out on the play-offs by one place and four points. However Ipswich entered administration, and were forced to sell talent such as Marcus Stewart, Titus Bramble, and Darren Ambrose; a relegation battle was only avoided after manager George Burley was replaced by Joe Royle. Ipswich then found another striking talent, Darren Bent (no relation), and Bent joined newly promoted Premier League side Leicester City on loan for the 2003\u201304 campaign, in a move that reunited him with manager Micky Adams. Bent scored ten goals in 35 games, though the First Division beckoned for the Foxes, as the Walkers Stadium outfit finished six points behind 17th place Everton."]}, {"page": "Lee Clark (footballer)", "response": ["On 26 June 2012, Clark was confirmed as manager of Birmingham City, with Terry McDermott as his Assistant Manager and Derek Fazackerley and Steve Watson as his First Team Coaches. John Vaughan was brought in as his Goalkeeping Coach and Malcolm Crosby was appointed Chief Scout. Clark signed Peter Lovenkrands, David Lucas, Hayden Mullins and Darren Ambrose in the summer of 2012, as well as Ravel Morrison, Ben Gordon, James Hurst, Leroy Lita, Paul Caddis, Paul Robinson, Rob Hall, Shane Ferguson and Wes Thomas later on throughout the 2012\u201313 season."]}, {"page": "Dougie Freedman", "response": ["He was ultimately successful in guiding Crystal Palace out of the relegation zone, with the club achieving safety with a game to spare.

At one point, he helped the under-17 team to the league title. Westlake then signed his professional forms with the club during the summer of 2002. Westlake reflected: \"I might never have played professional football had it not been for relegation. Administration meant the club were forced to sell players and that opened the door for people like myself, Darren Bent and Darren Ambrose. It gave us our chance and, as odd as it sounds, I personally feel I owe my career to relegation.\""]}, {"page": "1984 in association football", "response": ["** Darren Ambrose, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Apollon Smyrnis F.C.", "response": ["* Darren Ambrose"]}, {"page": "Kevin Keen", "response": ["Following a winless league run of 19 League One games stretching back to October 2015, Keen oversaw his first league victory for Colchester on 1 March 2016 as they defeated Bradford City 2\u20131 at Valley Parade courtesy of two Darren Ambrose goals.

The club's league form was poor, and 18 games into the campaign, Ipswich were bottom of the table with just one league victory. However, there was some relief in the UEFA Cup with a victory over Inter Milan 1\u20130 at home in the third round, despite which the tie was lost over two legs after a 4\u20131 defeat at the San Siro. From bottom of the table at Christmas, a run of seven wins from eight fixtures appeared to have secured the team's league status, but another decline set in and relegation was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 5\u20130 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield. The loss of income due to relegation to the Championship contributed to the club going into financial administration, resulting in the sale of a number of players including Jamie Clapham, Darren Ambrose, and club captain Matt Holland. Ipswich had the consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, through UEFA's Fair Play system, losing in the second round to Czech side Slovan Liberec. A poor start to the domestic season, leaving the club 19th in the table by mid-October, resulted in George Burley being sacked after nearly eight years as manager."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["| 8 July 2005 || Darren Ambrose|| Charlton Athletic||Undisclosed"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Charlton Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["* LM: #11,  Darren Ambrose, 33"]}, {"page": "List of foreign football players in Super League Greece", "response": ["*Darren Ambrose \u2013 Apollon Smyrni 2013\u20132014"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["Four days after the loss at Everton, Manchester United hosted Newcastle United.

The following season started well, with a League Cup run that saw Palace beat Crawley Town, Wigan Athletic and Middlesbrough, and by late October the club were sitting in third place in the league. A League Cup victory over Southampton set up a quarter final tie away at Manchester United.  However league form began to slip and Palace went on a run of five winless games without even scoring immediately prior to the match against United. Entering the tie as obvious underdogs, a 35-yard strike from Darren Ambrose and an extra-time header from Glenn Murray saw Palace win at Old Trafford for the first time in 22 years. The club then announced potential plans to update their image through a new badge. On the pitch, league form remained patchy, and the semi-final of the League Cup ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Cardiff City.

Cadogan then went on to start the first game of the season for Crystal Palace making his full debut under George Burley in the 3\u20132 win against Leicester City, assisting Darren Ambrose's goal. On 24 August 2010, in the second round of the League Cup game away to Portsmouth where Edgar Davids made his Crystal Palace debut, Cadogan came off the bench in the 68th minute. His cross forced Portsmouth's Ibrahima Sonko to score an own goal bringing the result to 1\u20131 forcing the game into extra time and then to penalties.
