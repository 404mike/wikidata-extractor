He served with his regiment in many stations throughout the Empire, inheriting his father's baronetcy in 1852, and held the rank of major in 1854 when the Crimean War broke out. Troubridge went out with his regiment and saw action in some of the early battles of the war, playing an important role in the Battle of Alma. He was involved in the heavy fighting surrounding the defence of British gun batteries during the Battle of Inkerman, and was badly wounded, losing his right leg and left foot. He refused to leave the battlefield until the attacks had been repulsed, and was commended for his gallantry by his commanding officer.\nHe returned to Britain and received a number of awards and promotions for his actions in the Crimea, but was unable to return to front-line service due to his injuries. He remained active in the army in superintending parts of the supply and logistics forces, which he carried out until his death in 1867.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["*Sir Thomas Troubridge, 3rd Baronet (1815\u20131867), British army officer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Troubridge (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Sir Thomas Troubridge, 3rd Baronet (1815\u20131867), British Army officer"]}]}}
