Hardcore DJs typically played their records at fast tempos, and breakbeat hardcore emphasised breakbeats over the 4-to-the-floor beat structure common to house music. Breakbeat hardcore records such as The Prodigy's \"Experience\" (1992) Top Buzz 'Jungle Techno!' (1991), A Guy Called Gerald's 'Anything' (1991), Shut Up and Dance's \"\u00a310 to get in\" / \"\u00a320 to get in\" (both 1989), the Ragga Twins' \"Spliffhead\" (1990) & '18\u00a0Inch Speaker' (1991), Rebel MC's 'Wickedest Sound' (1990), 'Coming On Strong' (1990), 'Tribal Bass' (1991) & 'African' (1991) Nightmares on Wax's 'Aftermath' & 'In Two Minds' (1990), Genaside II's \"Sirens of Acre Lane\" (1990), DJ Dextrous' \"Ruffneck Biznizz\" (1992), Noise Factory's 'Be Free' (1992), Demon Boyz 'Jungle Dett' (1992) and LTJ Bukem's \"Demon's Theme\" (1992) are generally credited as being among the first to have a recognizable drum and bass sound.", "\"A well edited Amen Break alongside an 808 sub kick and some simple atmospherics just sounded so amazing all on its own, thus the speech sample \"strictly drum and bass\". A whole new world of possibilities was opening up for the drum programming... It wasn't long before the amen break was being used by practically every producer within the scene, and as time progressed the Belgian style techno stabs and noises disappeared, and the edits and studio trickery got more and more complex. People were at last beginning to call the music Drum and Bass instead of hardcore. This Amen formula certainly helped cement the sound for many of the tracks I went on to produce for Gwange, Q-Project and Spinback on Legend Records. After a while, tracks using the Amen break virtually had a genre all of their own. Foul Play, Peshay, Bukem, DJ Dextrous, DJ Crystl and Source Direct among others were all solid amen addicts back then too.\"", "Towards late 1994 and especially in 1995 there was a definite distinction between the reggae and ragga sounding jungle and the tracks with heavily edited breaks, such as the artists Remarc, DJ Dextrous and The Dream Team on Suburban Base Records. Ironically, one compilation which brought the term to the wider awareness of those outside the scene, 'Drum & Bass Selection vol 1' (1994), featured a large number of ragga influenced tracks, and the first big track to use the term in its title (Remarc's 'Drum & Bass Wize', 1994) was also ragga-influenced."]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Hackney", "response": ["* DJ Dextrous, born Errol Francis, Ivor Novello Award- and BAFTA Award-winning producer and DJ known as Dextrous; born in Stoke Newington"]}, {"page": "King of the Jungle", "response": ["* King of the Jungle records, a record label run by DJ Dextrous and Rude Boy Keith"]}, {"page": "Errol Francis (DJ)", "response": ["#REDIRECT DJ Dextrous"]}, {"page": "Teebone", "response": ["In the 1990s, Teebone together with DJ Dextrous produced under a number of aliases including Fusion Forum and Regulators, releasing jungle and drum and bass records.
