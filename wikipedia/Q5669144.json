(2002) Goodbye to Beech? Farewell to Fagus? Quarterly Journal of Forestry 96 (2):97. The beech is classified as a native in the south of England and as a non-native in the north where it is often removed from 'native' woods.International foresters study Lake District's 'greener, friendlier forests' forestry.gov.uk Localised pollen records have been recorded in the North of England from the Iron Age by Sir Harry Godwin. Changing climatic conditions may put beech populations in southern England under increased stress and while it may not be possible to maintain the current levels of beech in some sites it is thought that conditions for beech in north-west England will remain favourable or even improve. It is often planted in Britain. Similarly, the nature of Norwegian beech populations is subject to debate. If native, they would represent the northern range of the species. However, molecular genetic analyses support the hypothesis that these populations represent intentional introduction from Denmark before and during the Viking Age. However, the beech in Vestfold and at Seim north of Bergen in Norway is now spreading naturally and regarded as native.B\u00f8k \u2013 en kulturvekst?

Silvester notes that Astbury (1958) and e.g. Seale (1975) Soil survey of Cambridgeshire preferred the term rodham. Roddam is used by Egar (1897) and also by Skertchly (1877); in Skertchly's case, as a local term \"used only in the Isle of Ely\". The Oxford English Dictionary quotes an even earlier written source of roddam as Wright (1857). Toponymist Richard Coates (2005) agrees that whilst roddon is now the normal geographical term, the older form, \u2013(h)am, rejected by Fowler, was in fact the correct local term, and writers who followed Fowler are wrong. Astbury goes further, quoting Clarke (1852) discussing \"veins of silt\" as silted-up creeks, which Astbury claims are rodhams, though Clarke does not use that term.", "The raised nature of the roddon is debated. The archaeologist Major Gordon Fowler explained these are due to the extensive drainage of the fens, and \"differential shrinkage\" of the silt bed and the surrounding peat. Harry Godwin noted that near the Holme Fen post the peat surface stood  above ordnance datum (OD) in 1848 with the clay of the fen floor about  below OD. In 1957 Godwin reported the peat surface at the same post  below OD \u2014 a shrinkage of  in 109 years. The peat is now  below OD in the area. The cause of the shrinking is due to a combination of drying out, trench cutting for peat-fuel, biological oxidation and surface burning associated with arable farming."]}, {"page": "Sir Harry Godwin", "response": ["#REDIRECTHarry Godwin"]}, {"page": "Harry Goodwin (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Harry Godwin (1901\u20131985), English botanist and ecologit"]}, {"page": "1970 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Professor Harry Godwin.
