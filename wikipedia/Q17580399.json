England was in Pool B alongside USA, Spain and Italy. On 10 August England played their first game of the tournament against Spain  and ran in ten tries, including a hat-trick to Kay Wilson, to record a 56\u20135 victory. New Zealand played Wales the same day and led 20\u20130 at half time before extending the final margin to 44\u201312, with Selica Winiata scoring a hat-trick of her own. New Zealand continued their dominance with a 121\u20130 thrashing of Hong Kong in their next game. They scored 19 tries in total, with eight of them coming from winger Portia Woodman. England's second match saw them score the same number of tries and points as their first one as they downed Italy 56\u201313. Despite the two victories, concerns were raised over their kicking as in both matches they only converted three of the ten tries. England's final pool game was against the USA and they played a dominant first half to lead 33\u20137, before the Americans fought back to a close the final score to 47\u201336. The result meant that both teams would advance to the Semi-Finals. New Zealand played Canada in their last pool game and with another hat-trick, this time from front rower Aldora Itunu,  New Zealand came away 48\u20135 victors."]}]}}
