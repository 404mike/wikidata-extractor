In his description, which he gave in an 1886 lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in London, he drew on reports by Adolph Kussmaul as well as describing the main ketones, acetoacetate and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, and their chemical determination. The condition remained almost universally fatal until the discovery of insulin in the 1920s; by the 1930s, mortality had fallen to 29 percent, and by the 1950s it had become less than 10 percent.

Manchester University Press; p. 179 Del\u00e9pine was appointed when Julius Dreschfeld moved from pathology to a chair in the principles and practice of medicine in 1891. His Swiss accent made understanding his lectures rather hard, but his reputation among the students was high. He organized the work of his department with great energy and then organized and opened a public health laboratory in 1891. This laboratory contributed much to the investigation of public health and problems of sanitation. Medical students were taught practical hygiene and bacteriology in the laboratory and could obtain a diploma in public health.Book of Manchester and Salford, pp. 60-61 Del\u00e9pine was from 1891 to 1910 professor of comparative pathology and bacteriology (he also taught pathology 1891-1904), then professor of public health and bacteriology from 1910 to 1921."]}, {"page": "Violet Dreschfeld", "response": ["Dreschfeld was born and grew up in the Chorlton suburb of Manchester, one of three children to Selina and Julius Dreschfeld, a German-born physician, who became a Professor of Pathology.
