Both matches were at Amblecote.\nHis highest score of 34 came against Lancashire in the second innings of his debut in August 1920. This constituted exactly half of Worcestershire's paltry total of 68; the county lost by an innings inside two days having been routed by a career-best 7/34 from James Tyldesley.\nClare's only other first-class outing was against Surrey in June 1925; he hit 25 in the second innings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Clare", "response": ["Thomas Clare may refer to:", "* Thomas Clare (cricketer) (1883\u20131940), English cricketer", "* Thomas Clare (monk), medieval English Benedictine monk and university chancellor"]}]}}
