To consolidate manpower and to increase the ratio of machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was reduced from twelve to nine; with each brigade being reduced from four to three battalions. This reduced the establishment of a division from 18,825 men to 16,035. For the 2nd\u00a0Division, this change took place in February when three battalions were disbanded. The troops from one were redistributed to other units within the division, while the others left. Major-General Cecil Pereira, the division's commander during this period, stated, \"The old soldiers who have survived many a fight are very hard hit by this.\" During the opening months of the year, the division again manned the frontline. Its last week in the line, which ended on 20\u00a0March, saw the division suffer 3,000 casualties from the German use of gas."]}, {"page": "Battle of Arras (1917)", "response": ["At 04:25 on 28 April, British and Canadian troops attacked on a front of about  north of Monchy-le-Preux.
