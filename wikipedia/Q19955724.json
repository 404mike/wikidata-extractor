(re-titled Those Were the Happy Times for its 1969 re-release) is a 1968 American biographical musical film directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews. The screenplay by William Fairchild is based on the life and career of British performer Gertrude Lawrence.", "Once Andrews was on board, Wise bought the rights to both Lawrence's 1945 autobiography A Star Danced and her widower's 1954 memoir Gertrude Lawrence as Mrs. A. Max Lamb did extensive research, including numerous interviews with people who actually had known Lawrence. Wise and Lamb believed the interviews provided a more accurate account than the material in the books, so the interviews became the basis of the screenplay. Wise felt it was important to hire a British screenwriter, and he decided on William Fairchild. The contrast between text in the books and the stories from the interviews found its way into the script, which initially had an animated Lawrence telling the story while the live version played out what (more or less) really happened. Eventually, Fairchild suggested Lawrence's story be told in (color) flashback while she watched a (black-and-white) documentary about her life, thus allowing the real Lawrence, who is seen on a set that is designed to be a screening room, to comment on the veracity of the fictionalized Lawrence in the film within the film.", "| William Fairchild"]}, {"page": "The Mackintosh Man", "response": ["William Fairchild was one of the uncredited writers on the script."]}, {"page": "Gianna Maria Canale", "response": ["|William Fairchild"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1955", "response": ["|John and Julie||William Fairchild||Sid James, Peter Sellers||Comedy||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1956", "response": ["|The Extra Day||William Fairchild||Richard Basehart, Simone Simon||Comedy/drama||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1958", "response": ["|The Silent Enemy||William Fairchild ||Laurence Harvey ||World War II ||"]}, {"page": "The Last Shot You Hear", "response": ["The film is based on William Fairchild's play The Sound of Murder which premiered in 1959 in a production starring Peter Cushing and Elizabeth Sellars.

His initial stage performances in 1966 - 1967 were with his local repertory theatre at Salisbury Playhouse. After leaving Salisbury, Protheroe settled with the New Theatre Royal Lincoln in 1968. There he met Martin Duncan, who became a musical collaborator. Stage roles such as in Bath Theatre Royal's 1970 production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, for which he was also the composer, followed, as well as television appearances in the historical drama Frontier and the anthology mystery series The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes. In 1973, Protheroe appeared in a production of William Fairchild's play Death on Demand in the role of a pop singer. For the play, he set a lyric written by Fairchild to music and, after it had been shopped around by Fairchild, this composition caught the attention of a Chrysalis Records rep. The label signed Protheroe as a solo artist.  Protheroe never released a recording of the song from Death on Demand, instead opting for \"Pinball\" as his debut single."]}, {"page": "Group 3 Films", "response": ["*John and Julie (1955) - directed by William Fairchild"]}]}}
