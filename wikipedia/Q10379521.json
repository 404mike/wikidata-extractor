Two months later he was released by Vale in the midst of a financial crisis and moved on to Doncaster Rovers in the Third Division. On 7 November 2002, he was on the move again, re-joining York on non-contract terms after training with the club. His fourth club in three months was Carlisle United, signing on a one-month contract on 29 November 2002. He remained at Brunton Park for the rest of 2002\u201303, playing in the 2003 Football League Trophy Final at the Millennium Stadium, which ended in a 2\u20130 defeat to Bristol City despite McCarthy linking up well with Stuart Green and almost providing an assist for Richie Foran. It was in this tournament that he scored his first goal for the club, in a 2\u20130 win over Wrexham. His only other goal for the club came in a 1\u20130 league win over Southend United.

(The original title had concluded in March 1993 with Roy Race having crashed his private helicopter; readers were left not knowing if he was alive or dead.) In September 1993, Roy awoke from a coma to find his famous left foot amputated after the crash. The new Roy was 'Delroy' of the Rovers, Paul \"Delroy\" Ntende, a ragamuffin who played for Nigeria. The new approach by Davis and editor Stuart Green was committed to the Kick Racism Out of Football Campaign. Davis also designed posters for the campaign featuring Delroy and Rocky. The strip itself dealt with issues of racism in the game, among other subjects. Green and Davis introduced many other innovations. Among these, he split the history of Roy Race into three generations of Race: grandfather, father, and son. In addition to the monthly stories in Roy of the Rovers, Davis drew another Roy strip in Shoot magazine as a two-page spread every week. Many of the changes made during Green and Davis' tenure on the strip were dropped in later revamps of the magazine.", "*  Roy of The Rovers Monthly  (art, script co-written with Stuart Green) (Fleetway Editions 19 issues, 1993\u201395)", "*  \"Roy of The Rovers\" (art only, scripts by Stuart Green) (Shoot Magazine weekly, IPC 1994\u201395) "]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|10||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Stuart Green"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|14||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Stuart Green"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|14||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Stuart Green"]}, {"page": "Edis Tatli", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Stuart Green"]}]}}
