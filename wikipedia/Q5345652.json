He holds a first degree in Business Administration (major in Finance) from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (1977), and an MSc and PhD in Computer Science from the University of Essex (1983 and 1987). Prior to his PhD studies, he served for five\nyears in various positions in the commercial sector in Hong Kong. \nEdward Tsang is the Director (and co-founder) of Centre for Computational Finance and Economic Agents (CCFEA) at University of Essex.\nCCFEA is an interdisciplinary\nresearch centre, which applies artificial intelligence methods to problems in finance and economics. \nEdward Tsang is the author of Foundations of Constraint Satisfaction, the first book to define the scope of the field. He is also the co-author of Vehicle Scheduling in Port Automation (with Hassan Rashidi) and Evolutionary Applications for Financial Prediction: Classification Methods to Gather Patterns Using Genetic Programming (with Alma Garcia Almanza).\nEdward Tsang founded the Computation Finance and Economics Technical Committee in IEEE\u2019s Computational Intelligence Society in 2004, and chaired it until the end of 2005. \nEdward Tsang specializes in business application of artificial intelligence. His research interests include artificial intelligence applications, computational finance, constraint satisfaction, evolutionary computation, and heuristic search.\nHe has given consultation to GEC Marconi, British Telecom, the Commonwealth Secretariat and other organizations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bounded rationality", "response": ["From a computational point of view, decision procedures can be encoded in algorithms and heuristics. Edward Tsang argues that the effective rationality of an agent is determined by its computational intelligence. Everything else being equal, an agent that has better algorithms and heuristics could make \"more rational\" (closer to optimal) decisions than one that has poorer heuristics and algorithms. Tshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their study on bounded rationality observed that advances in technology (e.g. computer processing power because of Moore's law, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics) expand the bounds that define the feasible rationality space. Because of this expansion of the bounds of rationality, machine automated decision making makes markets more efficient."]}, {"page": "Bargaining", "response": ["* On automated bargaining: Tim Gosling, Nanlin Jin & Edward Tsang, Games, supply chains and automatic strategy discovery using evolutionary computation, in J-P.
