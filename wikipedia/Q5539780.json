In a letter to a friend, Dickens said: \"I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature\", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that \"in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep\" on the Thames foreshore, and that \"the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter\". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged \u2014rising to  in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained on the banks of the river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event \"The Great Stink\"; the leading article in the City Press observed that \"Gentility of speech is at an end\u2014it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it\".
