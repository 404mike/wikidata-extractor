The savage, anonymous criticism this received (now known to be the work of Henry Peter Brougham) in the Edinburgh Review prompted his first major satire, English Bards and Scotch Reviewers (1809). It was put into the hands of his relation R. C. Dallas, requesting him to \"...get it published without his name.\" Alexander Dallas gave a large series of changes and alterations, as well as the reasoning for some of them. He also stated that Byron had originally intended to prefix an argument to this poem, and Dallas quoted it. Although the work was published anonymously, by April, R. C. Dallas wrote that \"you are already pretty generally known to be the author\". The work so upset some of his critics they challenged Byron to a duel; over time, in subsequent editions, it became a mark of prestige to be the target of Byron's pen."]}, {"page": "Alexander Dallas (Anglican priest)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Dallas (priest)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Dallas(Anglican Priest)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Dallas (priest)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Dallas (Anglican Priest)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Dallas (priest)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Robert Charles Dallas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Dallas (priest)"]}, {"page": "Robert Charles Dallas", "response": ["By the time of the Courier publication, Dallas had returned to France and died.

She challenged George Combe on his 1847 pamphlet Remarks on National Education. Another disagreement with her husband with a theological root was Elizabeth's support in the 1840s for Alexander Dallas, whose efforts with Irish Church Missions were dismissed by the archbishop. Elizabeth and her daughters supported the work of Ellen Smyly, an associate of Dallas, but without the backing of her husband. When Daniel Murray was succeeded by Paul Cullen as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, the family connection with Dallas caused Cullen to conclude that Richard Whately was concerned with proselytising.", "Elizabeth Whately died on 25 April 1860, in Hastings.
