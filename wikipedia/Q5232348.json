He played as a fly-half.\nHe had 14 caps for Scotland, from 1964 to 1968, scoring 1 try and 4 drop goals, 15 points on aggregate. He played in the Five Nations Championship, in 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968, playing in 11 games and scoring 2 drop goals, 6 points on aggregate. He also played for Melrose RFC.He was commonly linked with Alex Hastie, according to Allan Massie:\n\n\"They played together for Melrose for eleven seasons, in the course of which Chisholm scored more than a thousand points for the club... As a pair their understanding made them more than the sum of two individuals. Did Hastie ever lose Chisholm in any of the thirteen internationals they played together? It was their joint ability to tidy up bad ball and even turn it to advantage that made them the most secure of partnerships. Both tackled better than many wing forwards, and they would have revelled in the modern game... Their record of going ten internationals without defeat is unparalleled.\"His brother Robin Chisholm was also capped for Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Melrose RFC", "response": ["*  David Chisholm"]}, {"page": "Allan Massie", "response": ["* Jock Turner, David Chisholm, Alex Hastie, David Rollo, Norman Bruce, Iain Paxton"]}, {"page": "Frank Laidlaw", "response": ["He was capped thirty-two times for Scotland as a hooker between 1964 and 1971Griffiths, page 2:38-2:40 and captained his country twice.McLaren, p133 His 1966 game against Wales was what was known as \"the Melrose Game\" by Bill McLaren because his club, Melrose, had four players on the national side: the others being Alex Hastie, David Chisholm and Jim Telfer.
