Holyoake's definition of secularism differs from its usage by later writers. As the Humanist Heritage website notes, Holyoake provides a definition of secularism \"much akin to modern definitions of humanism... broader than just atheism.\" More modern definitions of seclarism are likely to pertain to separation of church and state rather than personal beliefs."]}, {"page": "Secular humanism", "response": ["thumb|upright|George Holyoake coined the term \"secularism\" and led the secular movement in Britain from the mid-19th century.", "In 1851 George Holyoake coined the term \"secularism\"Holyoake, G.

Years of consistent economic growth meant living standards generally increased, but Leicester was a stronghold of Radicalism. Thomas Cooper, the Chartist, kept a shop in Church Gate.

The Leicester Secular Society was founded in 1851 but secularist speakers such as George Holyoake were often denied the use of speaking halls. It was not until 1881 that Leicester Secular Hall was opened. The second half of the 19th century also witnessed the creation of many other institutions, including the town council, the Royal Infirmary, and the Leicester Constabulary. It also benefited from general acceptance (and the Public Health Acts ) that municipal organisations had a responsibility to provide for the town's water supply, drainage, and sanitation. In 1853, backed with a guarantee of dividends by the Corporation of Leicester the Leicester Waterworks Company built a reservoir at Thornton for the supply of water to the town . This guarantee was made possible by the Public Health Act 1847 and an amending local Act of Parliament of 1851. In 1866 another amending Act enabled the Corporation of Leicester to take shares in the company to enable another reservoir at Cropston, completed in 1870. The Corporation of Leicester was later able to buy the waterworks and build another reservoir at Swithland, completed in the 1890s.Elliott, Malcolm.op cit pages 62 -64 and 124\u2013135"]}, {"page": "Highgate Cemetery", "response": ["* Austin Holyoake, printer, publisher, freethinker and brother of the more widely known George Holyoake", "* George Holyoake, Birmingham-born social reformer and founder of the Cooperative Movement"]}, {"page": "Auguste Comte", "response": ["In later years, Comte developed the Religion of Humanity for positivist societies to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship.
