Nielsen's own piano technique, an echo of which is probably preserved in three wax cylinders marked \"Carl Nielsen\" at the State Archives in Aarhus, seems to have been mediocre. Reviewing the 1969 recording of works by the pianist John Ogdon, John Horton commented on the early pieces: \"Nielsen's technical resources hardly measure up to the grandeur of his designs\", whilst characterising the later pieces as \"major works which can stand comparison with his symphonic music\". The anti-romantic tone of the Symphonic Suite, Op. 8 (1894) was described by a later critic as \"nothing less than a clenched fist straight in the face of all established musical convention\".T\u00f8rsleff, Hans. Cited in . In Nielsen's words, the Chaconne, Op. 32 (1917) was \"a really big piece, and I think effective\". It is not only inspired by the work of Bach, especially the chaconne for solo violin, but also by the virtuoso piano arrangements of Bach's music by composers such as Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni. Also on a large scale, and from the same year, is the Theme and Variations, Op. 41, in which critics have discerned the influences of Brahms and also of Max Reger, of whom Nielsen had earlier written to a friend \"I think that the public will be utterly unable to grasp Reger's work and yet I am a lot more sympathetic towards his efforts than towards\u00a0...
