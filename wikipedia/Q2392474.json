In 1947 he was awarded a one-year postdoctoral fellowship to the John Innes Horticultural Institution in England with Kenneth Mather. While there he worked on the cytogenetics of Clarkia, and published on chromosomal counts in Clarkia in their Annual Report. It was not until 1951 that he published his next paper in Clarkia, which was concerned with the widespread occurrence of supernumerary chromosomes in Clarkia elegans, now known as Clarkia unguiculata. He further noted that members of this species were heterozygous for one or more reciprocal translocations, and that these abnormalities had no genetic effect. However, he hypothesized that the supernumeraries were produced as by-products of translocation heterozygotes, and that the mechanisms producing supernumerary chromosomes could account for the \"various chromosome numbers found in this genus.\""]}, {"page": "Houghton Poultry Research Station", "response": ["The site opened in 1948.
