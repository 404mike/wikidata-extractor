He won 16 caps for Wales.\nBoots was seen as a consistent player with a superb positional sense who would tackle hard and smother the loose ball; his passing skill was strong as was his catching and dribbling.  Boots was not a flair player but was a good 'spoiler' and could turn defence into attack, giving backs, such as Nicholls and Lloyd, a platform to run in tries. Boots had an exceptionally long rugby career, in spite of being on his death bed in 1908 with acute pleurisy.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1928 in Wales", "response": ["*29 December \u2013 George Boots, rugby player, 54Parry-Jones, David (1999).

After representing Wales for their fourth Triple Crown in 1905, Harding was chosen to face the Original All Blacks on the New Zealander's first tour of Britain.
