Dickens later used the prison as a setting in Little Dorrit. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age\". As he recalled to John Forster (from Life of Charles Dickens):", "On 2 April 1836, after a one-year engagement, and between episodes two and three of The Pickwick Papers, Dickens married Catherine Thomson Hogarth (1815\u20131879), the daughter of George Hogarth, editor of the Evening Chronicle. They were married in St Luke's Church, Chelsea, London. After a brief honeymoon in Chalk in Kent, the couple returned to lodgings at Furnival's Inn.. The first of their ten children, Charles, was born in January 1837 and a few months later the family set up home in Bloomsbury at 48 Doughty Street, London (on which Charles had a three-year lease at \u00a380 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839.. Dickens's younger brother Frederick and Catherine's 17-year-old sister Mary Hogarth moved in with them. Dickens became very attached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837. Unusually for Dickens, as a consequence of his shock, he stopped working, and he and Catherine stayed at a little farm on Hampstead Heath for a fortnight. Dickens idealised Mary; the character he fashioned after her, Rose Maylie, he found he could not now kill, as he had planned, in his fiction, and, according to Ackroyd, he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of Little Nell and Florence Dombey.. His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the June instalment of The Pickwick Papers and had to cancel the Oliver Twist instalment that month as well. The time in Hampstead was the occasion for a growing bond between Dickens and John Forster to develop; Forster soon became his unofficial business manager and the first to read his work.", "The Francophile Dickens often holidayed in France and, in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French, called the French \"the first people in the universe\".Soubigou, Gilles \"Dickens's Illustrations: France and other countries\" pp. 154\u2013167 from The Reception of Charles Dickens in Europe edited by Michael Hollington London: A&C Black 2013 p. 159.

In early 1849, Dickens started to write David Copperfield. It was published between 1849 and 1850. In Dickens's biography, Life of Charles Dickens (1872), John Forster wrote of David Copperfield, \"underneath the fiction lay something of the author's life\". It was Dickens's personal favourite among his own novels, as he wrote in the author's preface to the 1867 edition of the novel.", "In his will, drafted more than a year before his death, Dickens left the care of his \u00a380,000 estate (\u00a3 in ) to his long-time colleague John Forster and his \"best and truest friend\" Georgina Hogarth who, along with Dickens's two sons, also received a tax-free sum of \u00a38,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ). Although Dickens and his wife had been separated for several years at the time of his death, he provided her with an annual income of \u00a3600 (\u00a3 in ) and made her similar allowances in his will. He also bequeathed \u00a319 19s (\u00a3 in ) to each servant in his employment at the time of his death.", "Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody..", "Museums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote Oliver Twist, The Pickwick Papers and Nicholas Nickleby; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions, and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.. Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled Dickens and Little Nell, cast in 1891 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The 19th century saw the gradual reintroduction of Shakespeare's text to displace Tate's version. Like Garrick before him, John Philip Kemble had introduced more of Shakespeare's text, while still preserving the three main elements of Tate's version: the love story, the omission of the Fool, and the happy ending. Edmund Kean played King Lear with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. At last in 1838, William Macready at Covent Garden performed Shakespeare's version, freed from Tate's adaptions. The restored character of the Fool was played by an actress, Priscilla Horton, as, in the words of one spectator, \"a fragile, hectic, beautiful-faced, half-idiot-looking boy.\" And Helen Faucit's final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images. John Forster, writing in the Examiner on 14 February 1838, expressed the hope that \"Mr Macready's success has banished that disgrace [Tate's version] from the stage for ever.\" But even this version was not close to Shakespeare's: the 19th-century actor-managers heavily cut Shakespeare's scripts: ending scenes on big \"curtain effects\" and reducing or eliminating supporting roles to give greater prominence to the star. One of Macready's innovations\u2014the use of Stonehenge-like structures on stage to indicate an ancient setting\u2014proved enduring on stage into the 20th century, and can be seen in the 1983 television version starring Laurence Olivier."]}, {"page": "David Copperfield", "response": ["Between 1845 and 1848, Dickens wrote fragments of autobiography, excerpts of which he showed to his wife and John Forster. Then in 1855 he made an attempt at revising it. This was a failure because, as he tells his first love Maria Beadnell (now Mrs Winter), when he began dealing with his youthful love for her, \"I lost courage and burned the rest\".Charles Dickens, Letters, letter to Mrs Winter, 22 February 1855 Paul Schlicke points out that in fact not all the pages have gone through the flames and that, as Dickens began writing David Copperfield some pages were unearthed. Proof of this is found in the eleventh chapter of the novel: \"I begin Life on my own Account and don't like it\", where the story of Dickens's experience at the Warren Shoe Factory is told almost verbatim, with the only change, \"Mr Micawber\" instead of \"my father\". John Forster also published substantial extracts relating to this period in Dickens's biography, including a paragraph devoted to Wellington House College, which corresponds with the second stage of childhood recounted in the novel. Thus Dickens looks back on his painful past, already evoked by the martyrdom of Little Paul in Dombey and Son, though voiced by an omniscient narrator in that earlier novel. Until Forster published his biography of Dickens in 1872\u20131874, no one knew that Dickens had worked in a factory as a child, not even his wife, until Dickens wrote it down and gave the papers to Forster in 1847. The first generations of readers did not know this part of David Copperfield's story began like an incident in the author's life.", "The most important autobiographical material concerns the months that Dickens, still a child, spent at the Warren factory, his diligence with his first love, Maria Beadnell (see Catherine Dickens and Ellen Ternan), and finally his career as a journalist and writer. As pointed out by his biographer and friend John Forster, these episodes are essentially factual: the description of forced labor to which David is subjected at Murdstone and Grinby reproduces verbatim the autobiographical fragments entrusted to his friend; David's fascination with Dora Spenlow is similar to that inspired by the capricious Maria; the major stages of his career, from his apprenticeship at Doctors' Commons to writing his first novel, via the shorthand reporting of parliamentary procedures, also follow those of its creator.", "On 7 January 1849, Dickens visited Norwich and Yarmouth in Norfolk, with two close friends, John Leech (1817\u20131864) and Mark Lemon (1809\u20131870). Leech was an illustrator at Punch, a satirical magazine, and the first illustrator for A Christmas Carol by Dickens in 1843. Lemon was a founding editor of Punch, and soon a contributor to Household Words, the weekly magazine Dickens was starting up; he co-authored Mr Nightingale's Diary, a farce, with Dickens in 1851. The two towns, especially the second, became important in the novel, and Dickens informed Forster that Yarmouth seemed to him to be \"the strangest place in the world\" and that he would \"certainly try my hand at it\".Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 12 January 1849 During a walk in the vicinity of Yarmouth, Dickens noticed a sign indicating the small locality of Blunderston, which became in his novel the village of \"Blunderstone\" where David is born and spends his childhood.", "As always with Dickens, when a writing project began, he was agitated, melancholy, \"even deeper than the customary birth pangs of other novels\"; as always, he hesitated about the title, and his working notes contain seventeen variants, \"Charles Copperfield\" included. After several attempts, he stopped on \"The Copperfield Survey of the World as it Rolled\", a title that he retained until 19 April. When Forster pointed out that his hero, now called David, has his own initials transposed, Dickens was intrigued and declared that this was a manifestation of his fate. He was not yet sure of his pen: \"Though I know what I want to do, I am lumbering like a train wagon\",Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, April 19, 1849 he told Forster.", "Once launched, Dickens becomes \"quite confident\".Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 6 June 1849 The most difficult thing was to insert \"what I know so well\", his experience at the Warren factory; once the threads were woven, however, the truth mixed with fiction, he exulted and congratulated himself in a letter to Forster Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 10 July 1849 From now on, he wrote in this letter, the story \"bore him irresistibly along\". Never, it seems, was he in the grip of failures of inspiration, so \"ardent [is his] sympathy with the creatures of the fancy which always made real to him their sufferings or sorrows.\"", "Although plunged into the writing of his novel, Dickens set out to create a new journal, Household Words,Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 22 September 1849 the first issue of which appeared on 31 March 1850. This daunting task, however, did not seem to slow down the writing of David Copperfield: I am \"busy as a bee\", he writes happily to the actor William Macready.Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to William Macready, 11 June 1850", "Dickens marked the end of his manuscript on 21 October 1850 and felt both torn and happy like every time he finished a novel: \"Oh, my dear Forster, if I were to say half of what Copperfield makes me feel to-night, how strangely, even to you, I should be turned inside out! I seem to be sending some part of myself into the Shadowy World.\"Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 21 October 1850", "Dickens exploration of the subject of emigration in the novel has been criticised, initially by John Forster and later by G K Chesterton.", "John Forster, Dickens's early biographer, praises the bourgeois or middle-class values and ideology found in David Copperfield. Like him the Victorian reading public shared Copperfield's complacent views, expressed with the assurance of success that is his, at the end, as a recognized writer who is happy in marriage and safe from need.", "Many view this novel as Dickens's masterpiece, beginning with his friend and first biographer John Forster, who writes: \"Dickens never stood so high in reputation as at the completion of Copperfield\", and the author himself calls it \"his favourite child\".Conclusion of the preface of 1867: \"Like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.\" It is true, he says that \"underneath the fiction lay something of the author's life\", that is, an experience of self-writing. It is therefore not surprising that the book is often placed in the category of autobiographical works. From a strictly literary point of view, however, it goes beyond this framework in the richness of its themes and the originality of its writing.", "Dickens welcomed the publication of his work with intense emotion, and he continued to experience this until the end of his life. When he went through a period of personal difficulty and frustration in the 1850s, he returned to David Copperfield as to a dear friend who resembled him: \"Why,\" he wrote to Forster, \"Why is it, as with poor David, a sense comes always crashing on me now, when I fall into low spirits, as of one happiness I have missed in life, and one friend and companion I have never made?\u201dCharles Dickens, Letters, letter to John Forster, 3 and 4 (?) February 1855.It is likely here that Dickens refers to the failure of his marriage with his wife.

A month later, in a letter to John Forster, Dickens announced that he just had a new idea.Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, mid-September 1860 (?).", "As the idea and Dickens's ambition grew, he began writing. However, in September, the weekly All the Year Round saw its sales fall, and its flagship publication, A Day's Ride by Charles Lever, lost favour with the public. Dickens \"called a council of war\", and believed that to save the situation, \"the one thing to be done was for [him] to strike in.\"Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 4 October 1860. The \"very fine, new and grotesque idea\" became the magazine's new support: weeklies, five hundred pages, just over one year (1860\u20131861), thirty-six episodes, starting 1 December. The magazine continued to publish Lever's novel until its completion on 23 March 1861, but it became secondary to Great Expectations. Immediately, sales resumed, and critics responded positively, as exemplified by The Timess praise: \"Great Expectations is not, indeed, [Dickens's] best work, but it is to be ranked among his happiest.\"", "Dickens, whose health was not the best, felt \"The planning from week to week was unimaginably difficult\" but persevered. He thought he had found \"a good name\", decided to use the first person \"throughout\", and thought the beginning was \"excessively droll\": \"I have put a child and a good-natured foolish man, in relations that seem to me very funny.\"Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, beginning October 1860. Four weekly episodes were \"ground off the wheel\" in October 1860,Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to Wilkie Collins, 14 October 1860. and apart from one reference to the \"bondage\" of his heavy task,Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to Edmund Yates, 24 February 1861. the months passed without the anguished cries that usually accompanied the writing of his novels. He did not even use the Number Plans or Mems;Nineteen double sheets folded in half: on the left, names, incidents, and expressions; on the right, sections of the current chapter. he had only a few notes on the characters' ages, the tide ranges for chapter 54, and the draft of an ending. In late December, Dickens wrote to Mary Boyle that \"Great Expectations [is] a very great success and universally liked.\"Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to Mary Boyle, 28 December 1860.", "Following comments by Edward Bulwer-Lytton that the ending was too sad, Dickens rewrote it prior to publication. The ending set aside by Dickens has Pip, who is still single, briefly see Estella in London; after becoming Bentley Drummle's widow, she has remarried. It appealed to Dickens due to its originality: \"[the] winding up will be away from all such things as they conventionally go.\"Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, April 1861. Dickens revised the ending for publication so that Pip meets Estella in the ruins of Satis House, she is a widow and he is single. His changes at the conclusion of the novel did not quite end either with the final weekly part or the first bound edition, because Dickens further changed the last sentence in the amended 1868 version from \"I could see the shadow of no parting from her\" to \"I saw no shadow of another parting from her\". As Pip uses litotes, \"no shadow of another parting\", it is ambiguous whether Pip and Estella marry or Pip remains single. Angus Calder, writing for an edition in the Penguin English Library, believed the less definite phrasing of the amended 1868 version perhaps hinted at a buried meaning: '...at this happy moment, I did not see the shadow of our subsequent parting looming over us.'Great Expectations, Penguin, 1965, p. 496", "In a letter to Forster, Dickens explained his decision to alter the draft ending: \"You will be surprised to hear that I have changed the end of Great Expectations from and after Pip's return to Joe's\u00a0... Bulwer, who has been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken with the book, strongly urged it upon me, after reading the proofs, and supported his views with such good reasons that I have resolved to make the change. I have put in as pretty a little piece of writing as I could, and I have no doubt the story will be more acceptable through the alteration.\"Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 25 June 1861.", "This discussion between Dickens, Bulwer-Lytton and Forster has provided the basis for much discussion on Dickens's underlying views for this famous novel. Earle Davis, in his 1963 study of Dickens, wrote that \"it would be an inadequate moral point to deny Pip any reward after he had shown a growth of character,\" and that \"Eleven years might change Estella too.\"]. Retrieved 27 January 2013.--> John Forster felt that the original ending was \"more consistent\" and \"more natural\" but noted the new ending's popularity. George Gissing called that revision \"a strange thing, indeed, to befall Dickens\" and felt that Great Expectations would have been perfect had Dickens not altered the ending in deference to Bulwer-Lytton.George Gissing wrote: \"Great Expectations (1861) would be nearly perfect in its mechanism but for the unhappy deference to Lord Lytton's judgment, which caused the end to be altered. Dickens meant to have left Pip a lonely man, and of course rightly so; by the irony of fate he was induced to spoil his work through a brother novelist's desire for a happy ending, a strange thing, indeed, to befall Dickens.\", chapter III, The Story-Teller", "George Orwell wrote, \"Psychologically the latter part of Great Expectations is about the best thing Dickens ever did,\" but, like John Forster and several early 20th century writers, including George Bernard Shaw, felt that the original ending was more consistent with the draft, as well as the natural working out of the tale. Modern literary criticism is split over the matter.", "Robert L Patten estimates that All the Year Round sold 100,000 copies of Great Expectations each week, and Mudie, the largest circulating library, which purchased about 1,400 copies, stated that at least 30 people read each copy. Aside from the dramatic plot, the Dickensian humour also appealed to readers. Dickens wrote to Forster in October 1860 that \"You will not have to complain of the want of humour as in the Tale of Two Cities,\"Charles Dickens, Letters, Lettere to John Forster, beginning October 1860 an opinion Forster supports, finding that \"Dickens's humour, not less than his creative power, was at its best in this book.\" Moreover, according to Paul Schlicke, readers found the best of Dickens's older and newer writing styles."]}, {"page": "1846 in literature", "response": ["*January 21 \u2013 The Daily News, edited by Charles Dickens, first appears in London.

These plays are in the form of a trilogy in the first of which Fra Rupert contrives the death of Andrea, husband of Giovanna. Giovanna is suspected but acquitted in the second play. In the third play Fra Rupert is discovered. George Saintsbury described these as a historical novel thrown into conversational dramatic form. In 1839 Landor's attempts to publish the plays were caught up in a dispute between Bentley and Dickens and Forster which caused considerable delay. Again, although these plays, or \"conversations in verse\" did not succeed with the public, Landor gained warm admirers, many of whom were his personal friends. Southey's mind was giving way when he wrote a last letter to his friend in 1839, but he continued to mention Landor's name when generally incapable of mentioning anyone. Landor wandered around the country again, frequently visiting London, where he usually stayed with Lady Blessington, whom he had known at Florence. Mrs Paynter and her daughter Rose Paynter were at Bath, and Landor's letters and verses to Rose are among his best works. Rose later married Charles Graves-Sawle of Penrice in Cornwall. Landor met Charles Dickens and they enjoyed each other's company despite the age difference. Landor greatly admired Dickens's works, and was especially moved by the character of Nell Trent (from The Old Curiosity Shop). Landor was affectionately adapted by Dickens as Lawrence Boythorn in Bleak House. He was the godfather of Dickens's son Walter Landor Dickens.

Not a communicable idea (or the interest of the book would be gone), but a very strong one, though difficult to work.\" The story, I learnt immediately afterward, was to be that of the murder of a nephew by his uncle; the originality of which was to consist in the review of the murderer's career by himself at the close, when its temptations were to be dwelt upon as if, not he the culprit, but some other man, were the tempted. The last chapters were to be written in the condemned cell, to which his wickedness, all elaborately elicited from him as if told of another, had brought him. Discovery by the murderer of the utter needlessness of the murder for its object, was to follow hard upon commission of the deed; but all discovery of the murderer was to be baffled till towards the close, when, by means of a gold ring which had resisted the corrosive effects of the lime into which he had thrown the body, not only the person murdered was to be identified but the locality of the crime and the man who committed it. So much was told to me before any of the book was written; and it will be recollected that the ring, taken by Drood to be given to his betrothed only if their engagement went on, was brought away with him from their last interview. Rosa was to marry Tartar, and Crisparkle the sister of Landless, who was himself, I think, to have perished in assisting Tartar finally to unmask and seize the murderer.John Forster, The Life of Charles Dickens, 1876, vol. 1, pp. 451\u2013452", "# John Forster had the plot described to him by Dickens: \"The story ... was to be that of the murder of a nephew by his uncle.\"The Mystery of Edwin Drood, Chiltern Library edition, London, 1950; Introduction."]}, {"page": "Our Mutual Friend", "response": ["* Mr John Podsnap \u2013 a pompous man of the upper middle class, married to Mrs Podsnap and the father of Georgiana, who is smug and jingoistic.

However, Dickens insisted he only used some of Forster's mannerisms for this character, who was in no way to represent his closest friend. Forster, like Dickens, rose with difficulty from an impoverished middle-class background. The character of Podsnap was used to represent the views of \"Society\", as shown in his disapproval of Lizzie Hexam and Eugene Wrayburn's marriage.", "Inspiration for Our Mutual Friend, possibly came from Richard Henry Horne's essay \"Dust; or Ugliness Redeemed\", published in Household Words in 1850, which contains a number of situations and characters that are found in the novel. These include a dust heap, in which a legacy lies buried, a man with a wooden leg, who has an acute interest in the dust heap, Silas Wegg, and another character, Jenny Wren, with \"poor withered legs\".
