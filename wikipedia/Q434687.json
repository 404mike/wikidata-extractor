His childhood on a small Wiltshire farm had a great influence on him and provides the background to all his major works of fiction.\nJefferies's corpus of writings covers a range of genres and topics, including Bevis (1882), a classic children's book, and After London (1885), a work of science fiction. For much of his adult life he suffered from tuberculosis, and his struggles with the illness and with poverty also play a role in his writing. Jefferies valued and cultivated an intensity of feeling in his experience of the world around him, a cultivation that he describes in detail in The Story of My Heart (1883). This work, an introspective depiction of his thoughts and feelings about the world, gained him the reputation of a nature mystic at the time, but it is his success in conveying his awareness of nature and people within it, both in his fiction and in essay collections such as The Amateur Poacher (1879) and Round About a Great Estate (1880), that has drawn most admirers. Walter Besant wrote of his reaction on first reading Jefferies: \"Why, we must have been blind all our lives; here were the most wonderful things possible going on under our very noses, but we saw them not.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*Richard Jefferies (1848\u20131887) \u2013 Wood Magic, Bevis"]}, {"page": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction", "response": ["Richard Jefferies' novel After London (1885) can best be described as genuine post-apocalyptic fiction. After a sudden and unspecified catastrophe has depopulated England, the countryside reverts to nature and the few survivors return to a quasi-medieval way of life. The first chapters consist solely of a description of nature reclaiming England: fields becoming overrun by forest, domesticated animals running wild, roads and towns becoming overgrown, London reverting to lake and poisonous swampland. The rest of the story is a straightforward adventure/quest set many years later in the wild landscape and society, but the opening chapters set an example for many later science fiction stories."]}, {"page": "List of biographers", "response": ["*Henry Salt (En, 1851\u20131939) \u2013 Shelley, Richard Jefferies and Henry David Thoreau"]}, {"page": "Surbiton", "response": ["The Pre-Raphaelite painters John Everett Millais (1829\u20131896) and William Holman Hunt (1827\u20131910) came to Surbiton in 1851, 26 years before Richard Jefferies (1848\u20131887).
