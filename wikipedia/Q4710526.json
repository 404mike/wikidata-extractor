They became suspicious of the fate of Margaret Illingworth (n\u00e9e Wilberforce), Susan's aunt and the second wife of former cabinet minister Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth. Margaret was suffering from dementia and was invited to holiday in the de Stempel home in Docklow in February 1984. While there her fortune, much of it in the form of gold bars and valuable paintings, disappeared. At the same time her money and shares were sold using forged signatures and the contents of her London flat were emptied and sold at auction. It is estimated that Margaret was defrauded out of around \u00a31 million before being placed in the care of a nursing home in Hereford. She died in late 1986 and, as other members of the family were mostly unaware of her whereabouts, few attended her cremation. Margaret's will had been recently changed to remove her request to be buried in the Illingworth family tomb in Bradford. It also named Susan as the main recipient of most of her possessions."]}]}}
