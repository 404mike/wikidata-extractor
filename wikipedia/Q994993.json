During the 1930s, he worked as a screenwriter in the British film industry, mostly co-writing film scripts with other writers (approximately from 1930 to 1939). \nFrom 1961 through 1971, several of his works were made into films during the 1960s boom in German film adaptations of his father's novels. Sometimes Bryan's films are mistaken for Edgar Wallace adaptations, since they are so similar in plot and style.
