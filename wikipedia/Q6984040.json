A stalwart county player, he was a right-handed batsman and occasional right arm medium pace bowler.\nHe was born in Stechford, Birmingham and educated at Saltley Grammar School. He played for his native Warwickshire from 1964 to 1979.\nDespite a modest batting record (he averaged under 25 as a specialist batsman), he played over 250 times for the \"Bears\".  He made 3 first-class hundreds, with a best of 117 not out against Essex and scored his only one day hundred, 113 not out, against Hampshire.\nHe moved into coaching in 1980 after retiring from the game, initially as Warwickshire's Second XI coach and later with a 'roving brief' at all levels in the club.  He was particularly involved in the development of Ian Bell and the England team wore black arm bands in his honour during the Test against India at Edgbaston in the days following his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul West (footballer)", "response": ["West was a promising cricketer.
