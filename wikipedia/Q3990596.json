By 1800 it had about 300 employees in Staffordshire.  The Napoleonic Wars made exporting to Europe impossible for long periods, and left export markets in disarray.  Thomas Byerley, Josiah's nephew, became a partner and was mainly in charge for some years, as Josiah's sons John, known as Jack, and Josiah II (\"Joss\"), who joined the firm only on Josiah I's retirement, had developed other interests, in particular horticulture.  After Waterloo in 1815, there was a dramatic drop in the vital exports to America.  Byerley's death in 1810 forced the brothers to confront the reality of the financial situation, as they needed to buy out his widow.  Between the partners and other debtors, the firm was owed some \u00a367,000, a huge sum.  Joss bought Jack out, and continued as sole owner.Dolan, 385-389"]}, {"page": "Anthony Todd Thomson", "response": ["In 1820 he married Katherine Byerley, a prolific writer.

The Iron Rail Way, as it was originally known, opened in 1806. It was designed by John Hodgkinson using the same construction techniques as the Surrey Iron Railway. It was  gauge and 3.4 miles long. The rails were cast iron, L-shaped, 3\u00a0ft long and weighed 40\u00a0lb. The horse-drawn clay wagons had flangeless wheels, and the sleepers were simply stone blocks 60-70\u00a0lb each numbering well in excess of 10,000.
