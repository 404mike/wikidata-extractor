His first important contribution to the field was a 1977 book on Italian syntax.  He achieved international recognition in 1981 for his book Transformational Syntax, which sold over 30,000 copies and was the standard introduction to Chomsky's Government and Binding Theory for many years; and this was followed by an introduction to transformational grammar in 1988, which sold over 70,000. He has since published several books on syntax within the framework of generative grammar and the Minimalist Program of Noam Chomsky, a number of which have appeared in the series Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics.\nIn the 1990s, Radford was a pioneer of the maturation-based structure building model of child language, and the acquisition of functional categories in early child English within the Principles and Parameters framework, in which children are seen as gradually building up more and more complex structures, with lexical categories (like noun and verb) being acquired before functional-syntactic categories (like determiner and complementiser): this research resulted in the publication of a monograph on Syntactic Theory and the Acquisition of English Syntax in 1990, and numerous articles on the acquisition of syntax by monolingual, bilingual and language-disordered children.\nSince 2010, Radford has researched the syntax of colloquial English, using data recorded from unscripted radio and TV broadcasts. He produced a research monograph on this, and a number of articles, and is preparing a follow-up research monograph on the syntax of relative clauses in colloquial English.Since January 2014, Radford has been an Emeritus Professor of the Department of Language and Linguistics, University of Essex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Transformational syntax", "response": ["Many notable linguists have written on the topic, including Andrew Radford,Radford, Andrew (1982).
