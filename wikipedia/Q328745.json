He was the creator of the dark humour television series Monkey Dust, screened between 2003 and 2005.\nBorn in London, Thompson was educated at Highgate School and Brasenose College, Oxford, then joined the BBC as a trainee in 1981. He soon focused his attention on comedy, working as a researcher for Not the Nine O'Clock News and BBC Radio's The Mary Whitehouse Experience. Rising to the level of producer, he produced the BBC radio shows The News Quiz and Lenin of the Rovers. Hat Trick Productions subsequently employed Thompson to produce a television adaptation of The News Quiz, entitled Have I Got News For You, a critical and commercial success which Thompson produced for five years before moving onto other projects.\nA biographer and novelist, Thompson wrote six books: an investigation into the story of The Man in the Iron Mask; a biography of Herg\u00e9 with a commentary on his Adventures of Tintin series; biographies of Peter Cook and Richard Ingrams; a novel, This Thing of Darkness; and the semi-autobiographical Penguins Stopped Play.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herg\u00e9", "response": ["Now free from threat of prosecution, Herg\u00e9 continued to support his colleagues at Le Soir who were being charged as collaborators; six of them were sentenced to death, and others to lengthy prison sentences. Among those sentenced to death was Herg\u00e9's friend, Jamin, although his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In May 1946, Herg\u00e9 was issued a certificate of good citizenship, which became largely necessary to obtain employment in post-war Belgium. Celebrations were marred by his mother's death in April 1946; she was aged 60. Harry Thompson has described this post-war period as the \"greatest upheaval\" of Herg\u00e9's life. Herg\u00e9 later described it as \"an experience of absolute intolerance. It was horrible, horrible!\" He considered the post-war trials of alleged collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people, and never forgave Belgian society for the way that he had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona.", "Herg\u00e9 was a highly private person, being described by biographer Harry Thompson as \"reserved [and] unostentatious\". According to his biographer Pierre Sterckx, Herg\u00e9 appeared \"very conventional\" in public, but in reality was \"extremely erudite, with an insatiable curiosity, constantly on the watch\". He greatly enjoyed walking in the countryside, gardening, and art collecting, and he was a fan of jazz music. Although he disliked making public or press appearances, Herg\u00e9 insisted on personally responding to all fan mail received, which took up a considerable part of his time. He stated that \"not replying to children's letters would be to betray their dreams.\" Friends described him as a humorous man, known particularly for his self-deprecating jokes. Colleagues described Herg\u00e9 as egocentric, an assessment he agreed with. He was known to be authoritarian in dealing with his assistants and refused to share credit with them for their part in his work. Sterckx noted that \"on the one hand he could be distant, even frosty, but on the other he was affectionate\".", "Politically, Herg\u00e9 was a fervent royalist, and remained so throughout his life, also believing in the unity of Belgium. In his early life, Herg\u00e9 was \"close to the traditional right-wing\" of Belgian society, with Sterckx noting that through his work he was \"plunged into rightist, even extreme right-wing circles\". According to Harry Thompson, such political ideas were not unusual in middle-class circles in Belgium of the 1920s and early 1930s, where \"patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline and naivety were so inextricably bound together in everyone's lives that right-wing politics were an almost inevitable by-product. It was a world view shared by everyone, distinguished principally by its complete ignorance of the world.\" When Herg\u00e9 took responsibility for , he followed Wallez's instruction and allowed the newspaper to contain explicitly pro-fascist and anti-semitic sentiment. Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s noted that the character of Tintin was a personification of the \"New Youth\" concept which was promoted by the European far right. Under Wallez's guidance, the early Adventures of Tintin contained explicit political messages for its young readership. Tintin in the Land of the Soviets was a work of anti-socialist propaganda, while Tintin in the Congo was designed to encourage colonialist sentiment toward the Belgian Congo, and Tintin in America was designed as a work of anti-Americanism heavily critical of capitalism, commercialism, and industrialisation."]}, {"page": "November 7", "response": ["*2005 \u2013 Harry Thompson, English author, screenwriter, and producer (b. 1960)"]}, {"page": "Paul Whitehouse", "response": ["| 1995 || Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award || TV \u2013 Light EntertainmentShared with Harry Enfield, Simon Greenall, Ian Hislop, Geoffrey Perkins, Nick Newman, Harry Thompson & Kay Stonham || Harry Enfield & Chums || "]}, {"page": "The Adventures of Tintin", "response": ["In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II spread further across Europe.

For political reasons, the Nazi authorities closed down Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, leaving Herg\u00e9 unemployed. In search of employment, he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, Le Soir (The Evening), which was allowed to continue publication under German management. On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children's supplement, Le Soir Jeunesse, in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures. In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Herg\u00e9 could no longer politicize The Adventures of Tintin lest he be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer.", "As Harry Thompson observed, the idea was to turn the process of creating The Adventures of Tintin into a \"veritable production line, the artwork passing from person to person, everyone knowing their part, like an artistic orchestra with Herg\u00e9 conducting\".", "The study of Tintin, sometimes referred to as \"Tintinology\", has become the life work of some literary critics in Belgium, France and England.

Beno\u00eet Peeters exclaimed that with this scene, the reader can imagine Tintin's surprise at encountering an adventure he had not yet had and which included the characters of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus whom he had not yet met. Another anachronism in this version appears when Snowy refers to Marlinspike Hall, the ancestral home of Captain Haddock, from the much later volumes of the series. Harry Thompson opined that the most important changes to the book were artistic, for in the late 1950s Herg\u00e9 was at the peak of his artistic ability.", "Harry Thompson considered Cigars of the Pharaoh \"almost completely unrecognisable from its predecessors\", praising its \"inspired comic characters\" and \"observed character comedy\", which he thought escaped the sheer slapstick evident in the earlier Adventures. He also praised the elements of mystery and suspense that Herg\u00e9 introduced, opining that it created \"a genuine sense of fear without recourse to a deus ex machina\". More critically, he thought that the plot's \"glaring flaw\" was the immediate transposition of events from Egypt to India, also believing that the inclusion of British colonialists as the antagonists made \"partial amends\" for the colonialist attitude displayed by Tintin in Tintin in the Congo. Michael Farr thought that Tintin was \"a maturer hero\" in Cigars, being more of a detective than a reporter. He thought that the dream sequence was \"one of the most imaginative and disturbing scenes\" in the series, illustrating Herg\u00e9's \"growing virtuosity with the medium\". He also praised the scenes set in the Indian colonial bungalow, commenting that it was \"claustrophobic and sinisterly dramatic\" and worthy of the work of Agatha Christie, opining that the car chase provided \"a highly cinematic ending\".

Ultimately, he deemed it one of the best three Tintin adventures written before World War II, alongside The Blue Lotus and The Black Island. He also thought it noteworthy that in 1976, archaeologists discovered a sceptre belonging to a 13th-century King Ottokar in St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague. Herg\u00e9 biographer Pierre Assouline believed that the story had the atmosphere of Franz Leh\u00e1r's The Merry Widow, with \"added touches\" from the films of Erich von Stroheim and Ernst Lubitsch. Fellow biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters thought that it exhibited \"a political maturity\" and \"originality\".

The Akass character was also influenced by an article about the Indian guru Rajneesh which Herg\u00e9 had read in a December 1982 edition of the Paris Match. In Herg\u00e9's notes, he included the idea of revealing that Akass was Tintin's nemesis, Rastapopoulos, in disguise, with Farr believing that this plot twist would have been revealed had Herg\u00e9 completed the story. Conversely, Harry Thompson suggested that Herg\u00e9 had dropped Rastapopoulos from the story in 1980. Herg\u00e9's notes reveal that he considered various different names for the artist character, including Ramon Hasj and Ramo Nasj, before settling on Ramo Nash. Similarly, he had initially debated whether Nash should be a painter or a sculptor, before deciding on the latter.", "In a later publication, Peeters expressed a different view, stating that \"one cannot help but feel disappointed\" with Alph-Art. Similarly, Harry Thompson expressed the view that Herg\u00e9 would never have completed the story, and that while \"many critics like to think... Tintin and Alph-Art was set to be Herg\u00e9's last great masterpiece\", he disagreed, describing this as \"surely just wishful thinking\".

Believing the plot to be \"extremely simple\", he thought that Tintin's character was like a child manipulating a world populated by toy animals and lead figurines. Michael Farr felt that, unlike the previous Tintin adventure, some sense of a plot emerges at the end of the story with the introduction of the American diamond-smuggling racket. Philippe Goddin thought the work to be \"more exciting\" than Land of the Soviets and argued that Herg\u00e9's depiction of the native Congolese was not mocking but a parody of past European militaries. By contrast, Harry Thompson believed that \"Congo is almost a regression from Soviets\", in his opinion having no plot or characterisation; he described it as \"probably the most childish of all the Tintin books\". Simon Kuper of the Financial Times criticised both Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo as the \"worst\" of the Adventures, opining that they were \"poorly drawn\" and \"largely plot-free\".", "In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several campaigners and writers characterised Tintin in the Congo as racist due to its portrayal of the Congolese as infantile and stupid. According to Tom McCarthy, Herg\u00e9 depicted the Congolese as \"good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery\". There had been no such controversy when originally published, because it was only following the decolonization of Africa, which occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, that Western attitudes towards indigenous Africans shifted. Harry Thompson argued that one must view Tintin in the Congo in the context of European society in the 1930s and 1940s, and that Herg\u00e9 had not written the book to be \"deliberately racist\". He argued that it reflected the average Belgian view of Congolese people at the time, one that was more \"patronising\" than malevolent. Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s supported this idea, as did biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters, who asserted, \"Herg\u00e9 was no more racist than the next man\". After meeting Herg\u00e9 in the 1980s, Farr commented, \"You couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist.\""]}, {"page": "The Black Island", "response": ["Harry Thompson thought that The Black Island expressed a \"convenient, hitherto unsuspected regard for the British\" on Herg\u00e9's behalf, with Britain itself appearing as \"a little quaint\". He thought that it \"outstrips its predecessors\" both artistically and comedically, describing it as \"one of the most popular Tintin stories\". He felt that some of the logically implausible slapstick scenes illustrated \"the last flicker of 1920s Tintin\", but that the 1966 version was \"a fine piece of work and one of the most beautifully drawn Tintin books\". Michael Farr commented on the \"distinct quality and special popularity\" of The Black Island. He thought that the inclusion of many airplanes and a television in the first version was symptomatic of Herg\u00e9's interest in innovation and modernism. Commenting on the differences between the third version of the comic and the earlier two, he thought that the latter was \"strongly representative\" of the artistic talents of Studios Herg\u00e9 in the 1960s, but that it was nevertheless inferior, because it had replaced the \"spontaneity and poetry\" of the original with \"over-detailed and fussily accurate\" illustrations."]}, {"page": "The Secret of the Unicorn", "response": ["The Secret of the Unicorn was serialized amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II.
