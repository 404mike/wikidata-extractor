However, he scored three times including Walsall's third goal in the 93rd minute of a 3\u20131 win away to Shrewsbury Town, prior to a brace in a 2\u20130 win at home to Port Vale after being introduced as a 60th-minute substitute for Kieron Morris. His contributions helped Walsall to qualify for the play-offs after a third-place finish in League One. Cook played in both semi-final legs as a substitute, scoring a late consolation goal in the second leg as Walsall lost 3\u20131 to Barnsley and 6\u20131 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "Cross-border derby", "response": ["|Kieron Morris||2015|| Wrexham"]}, {"page": "2015 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|MF ||27|| Kieron Morris || || "]}]}}
