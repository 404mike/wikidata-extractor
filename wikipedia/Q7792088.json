Better that those who had been \"respectable\" as the armed \"property of the nation\" should retire than run the risks of an \"armed beggary\". (Writing a generation later, Thomas MacNevin proposed that Grattan's judgement marked \"the transition point\", when \"composed of a different class of men, and ruled by politicians with very different views\", the rump of the Volunteer movement entered upon \"a career which terminated only in the establishment of the United Irishmen\").
