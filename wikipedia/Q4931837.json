He scored the hosts' first goal. That was his only appearance in the 1896\u201397 campaign.\nBirket made fourteen league appearances the following season, 1897\u201398, scoring eight goals. In 1898\u201399, he was the club's top scorer with fifteen goals in his 24 appearances. His efforts were not enough to keep Blackpool in the Football League, however: they failed to be re-elected, along with Darwen.\nIn Blackpool's one season in League exile, 1899\u201390, Birket became the first Blackpool to score a hat-trick. It came against Darwen on 16 November 1899. He also scored five in a Boxing Day victory over Stockport County and four against Wigan Athletic on 17 March 1900.Birket continued his scoring ways for Blackpool's first season back in the Football League, with ten strikes, again finishing as the club's top scorer.\nFor the second half of the 1901\u201302 campaign, Birket was moved to the right-back position. As to be expected his goals dried up and he found the net only twice in his 26 appearances.\nHe continued in the right-back berth for the remainder of his career, with the majority of his infrequent goals coming from the penalty spot.\nBirket played his last game on 22 September 1906, just four games into Blackpool's 1906\u201307 campaign.", "link_mentions": {}}}
