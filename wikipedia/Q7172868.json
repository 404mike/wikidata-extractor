The Sunday Times has claimed that he had a 50% stake in the company while creating the first British police training programme for their use. Their license was revoked as a result of irregularities found during the investigation into the death of Raoul Moat.Boatman had previously been lampooned by comedian and activist Mark Thomas, who described how Pro-Tect had breached new UK controls on torture equipment and brokerage.He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the 1998 New Year Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2010 Northumbria Police manhunt", "response": ["In September 2010, it was found that Pro-Tect Systems, the company that had supplied the Tasers, had breached its licence by supplying the \"experimental\" weapons directly to the police. Home Secretary Theresa May subsequently revoked the firm's licence after confirming that the Tasers were never officially approved for use. On 1 October 2010, former policeman Peter Boatman, a director of Pro-Tect systems, was found dead at his home. The incident was treated by police as a presumed suicide; they referred the matter to the coroner.
