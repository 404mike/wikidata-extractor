He was 27 years old, and a lance corporal in the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment (Princess Charlotte of Wales's), British Army during the First World War when he performed the actions for which he was awarded the VC.\nOn 29 April 1917 near Oppy, France, Lance-Corporal Welch entered an enemy trench and killed one man after a severe hand-to-hand struggle. Then, armed only with an empty revolver, he chased four enemies across the open and captured them single-handedly. He handled his machine-gun with the utmost fearlessness, and more than once went into the open, exposed to heavy fire, to search for and collect ammunition and spare parts in order to keep his guns in action, which he succeeded in doing for over five hours, until wounded by a shell.He later achieved the rank of sergeant. He died on 28 June 1978 at Bournemouth and was cremated. His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment (Salisbury) Museum, Salisbury, Wiltshire, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Miles Dempsey", "response": ["Following attacks near Miraumont and then Oppy, during which Lance Corporal James Welch was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), the battalion, badly understrength, thereafter remained in a quiet sector of the front for most of the year, and was temporarily merged with the 23rd (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers. Dempsey was soon posted as a staff officer at II Corps headquarters (HQ), before returning to the 1st Royal Berkshires, this time in command of A Company. In late November the battalion attacked Bourlon Wood as part of the Battle of Cambrai."]}, {"page": "James Welch", "response": ["James Welch may refer to:", "* James Welch (VC) (1889\u20131978), English recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* James Welch (writer) (1940\u20132003), Native American author and poet"]}, {"page": "Royal Berkshire Regiment", "response": ["The 1st Battalion was a Regular Army unit and was serving with the 6th Brigade, part of the 2nd Division and served with the British Expeditionary Force when it was sent to Belgium in 1914.

In 1915 during the Battle of Loos, 2nd Lieutenant Alexander Buller Turner of the 3rd Battalion, attached to the 1st, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. In 1916 Lance corporal James Welch, also of the 1st Battalion, was awarded the Victoria Cross as well."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*James Welch, soldier, was born in Stratfield Saye"]}]}}
