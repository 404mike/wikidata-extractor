Blunstone was able to expand the squad slightly, with midfielders Brian Turner and Brian Tawse signing on a permanent basis and forward Alan Cocks coming in on loan to replace departed loanee Gerry Baker. Ever-present goalkeeper Chic Brodie had his best season so far at Griffin Park and kept 20 clean sheets. The Bees moved as high as 2nd position in late January and early February 1970 and manager Blunstone went for broke, finally signing a recognised centre forward (Roger Cross from West Ham United for \u00a310,000) and bringing winger John Docherty back for a third spell with the club. Three defeats in four matches in late March and early April effectively ended the promotion charge, with the three-point gap to 4th-place Port Vale proving to be insurmountable.", "|Alan Cocks", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Alan Cocks", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Alan Cocks", "| Alan Cocks"]}]}}
