While his demise led to an outburst of mass demonstrations abroad and quick creation of a martyr image internationally, the immediate reaction to his death in the Congo was not as uniform. Tetela, Songye, and Luba-Katanga peoples created folks songs of mourning for him, but these were groups which had been involved in political alliances with him and, at the time, Lumumba was unpopular in large segments of the Congolese populace, particularly in the capital, Bas-Congo, Katanga, and South Kasai. Some of his actions and the smearing of him as a communist had also generated disaffection in the army, civil service, labour unions, and the Catholic Church. Lumumba's reputation as a martyr in the collective memory of the Congolese was only cemented later, partly due to the initiatives of Mobutu. In Congolese collective memory, it is perceived that Lumumba was killed through Western machinations because he defended the Congo's self-determination. The killing is viewed in the context of the memory as a symbolic moment in which the Congo lost its dignity in the international realm and the ability to determine its future, which has since been controlled by the West. Lumumba's determination to pursue his goals is extrapolated upon the Congolese people as their own; securing the Congo's dignity and self-determination would thus ensure their \"redemption\" from victimisation by Western powers. Historian David Van Reybrouck wrote, \"In no time Lumumba became a martyr of decolonisation...He owed this status more to the horrible end of his life than to his political successes.\" Journalist Michela Wrong remarked that \"He really did become a hero after his death, in a way that one has to wonder if he would have been such a hero if he had remained and run the country and faced all the problems that running a country as big as Congo would have inevitably brought.\" Drama scholar Peit Defraeya wrote, \"Lumumba as a dead martyr has become a more compelling figure in liberationist discourse than the controversial live politician.\" Historian Pedro Monaville wrote that \"his globally iconic status was not commensurate with his more complex legacy in [the] Congo.\" Cooptation of Lumumba's legacy by Congolese presidents and state media has generated doubts in the Congolese public about his reputation."]}, {"page": "List of books banned by governments", "response": ["| Michela Wrong"]}, {"page": "James Cameron (journalist)", "response": ["* 2010.

Approximately two million Hutu lived as refugees in neighbouring countries until 1996, when Kagame forced them to return home. Many Hutu also supported the late 1990s cross-border insurgency against Kagame by defeated forces of the former regime. By 1999, the RPF had weakened the insurgents and Tutsi and Hutu began living together peacefully in the northwest. Kayumba Nyamwasa, at the time still part of the Rwandan army, said that \"the mood had changed\", attributing a shift in Hutu attitude to a shift in the \"balance of forces in the country\", with the genocidaires having \"no chance of returning to power\". As of 2021, with a lack of free speech in Rwanda, and elections which are generally regarded as lacking freedom and fairness, Kagame's popularity amongst the Rwandwan population is unknown. Journalists Jason Burke of The Guardian and Al Jazeera's Rashid Abdallah describe the president as \"authentically popular in Rwanda\" and as enjoying \"overwhelming public support\" respectively. British journalist and author Michela Wrong and Filip Reyntjens disagree, with Wrong saying that \"the level of invective Kagame dedicates to the Rwanda National Congress, the amount of energy he has expended trying to get Uganda and South Africa to expel or extradite or close down these players, suggests he sees them as a real threat\"."]}, {"page": "Kisangani", "response": ["* Michela Wrong:  In the Footsteps of Mr Kurtz,2002.
