McGrory was then replaced as manager by Frank Taylor. Oscroft hit ten goals in 39 games in 1952\u201353 to become the club's top scorer, as the \"Potters\" were relegated into the Second Division after finishing one point behind 20th place Manchester City.

Oscroft hit 18 goals in 43 games in 1955\u201356, becoming the club's joint-top-scorer, along with Frank Bowyer and Johnny King.

Soon after Oscroft's arrival, Stoke's defence started to leak goals and FA Cup finalists Arsenal put six past them at Highbury without a Stoke reply.
