In his playing days he was a forward, and he scored a total of 159 goals in 555 Football League games.\nHe started his career at Tranmere Rovers in 1965, and in six years at the club would make close to 200 appearances. From March 1972, he then spent three years with Brighton & Hove Albion, making around 100 appearances. In May 1974 he signed with Blackburn Rovers for \u00a325,000, and went on to play close to 100 games with the club in a two-year spell. Bought by Port Vale for \u00a312,000 in September 1976, he was voted the club's Player of the Year in 1977\u201378, and was the club's top scorer for two consecutive seasons. Sold to Bury for \u00a335,000 in September 1978, he played around 50 games, before he moved back to Tranmere Rovers in 1979. In 1981, he transferred to Swindon Town, before he announced his retirement the following year. He later served as Swindon's manager in the 1983\u201384 campaign.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swindon Town F.C.", "response": ["* Ken Beamish 1983\u20131984"]}, {"page": "John Trollope (footballer)", "response": ["Following his retirement from playing, Trollope replaced Bobby Smith as the club's manager early in the following season. His time as manager was far from successful - working on a shoestring budget, he led Swindon to their first ever relegation to Division Four. He made way for Ken Beamish near the end of the 1982\u201383 season."]}, {"page": "Roy Sproson", "response": ["For the 1976\u201377 season he was forced to sell Terry Lees to Sparta Rotterdam for \u00a325,000 (representing a \u00a322,000 profit in the space of twelve months). He added to his squad with youngsters Ian Osborne and Kevin Kennerley, and experienced midfielder Geoff Davies. After Cullerton suffered a cartilage injury he signed Ken Beamish for a \u00a312,000 fee from Blackburn Rovers, as well as former Wigan Athletic forward John Rogers for 'a small fee'. His team struggled with poor discipline \u2013 Rotherham manager Jimmy McGuigan claimed Vale were 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Midway through the season Sproson sold two more key players: striker Ray Williams went into non-league football for 'a small fee' and midfielder Colin Tartt joined Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. Sproson brought in Alan Lamb from Preston North End and Peter Sutcliffe from Stockport County for a combined outlay of \u00a38,000. Ultimately though, the loss of star midfielder Brian Horton to Brighton for \u00a330,000 in March 1976 was something Sproson proved unable to remedy. Nevertheless, relegation was narrowly avoided at the end of 1976\u201377, as his side finished nineteenth, three points above the drop."]}]}}
