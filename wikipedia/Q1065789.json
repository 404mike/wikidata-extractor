His findings were published in his Pyramidographia (1646)Reprinted in Miscellaneous works of Mr. John Greaves Vol. I (1737) and under his name in an anonymous tract.J. Greaves [probably not the real author], The origin and antiquity of our English weights and measures discover'd: by their near agreement with such standards that are now found in one of the Egyptian pyramids: together with the explanation of divers lines therein heretofore measured (London: Printed for G. Sawbridge, 1706: 2nd edition, 1745).  More than a century later, Greaves' measurements and additional measurements made by French engineers during Napoleon's expedition in Egypt, were studied by John Taylor (1781\u20131864). Taylor claimed that the measurements indicated that the ancients had used a unit of measure about 1/1000 greater than a modern British inch.John Taylor, The Great Pyramid, Why Was It Built? and Who Built It? (London, 1859). This was the origin of the \"pyramid inch\".  Taylor regarded the \"pyramid inch\" to be 1/25 of the \"sacred cubit\", ancient unit based on the forearm length from the tip of the middle finger to the bottom of the elbow,  whose existence had earlier been postulated by Isaac Newton.However Newton's value for this cubit was somewhat shorter; see Peter Tomkins, Secrets of the Great Pyramid (London: Allen Lane, 1971), p. 30\u201331.  The principal argument was that the total length of the four sides of the pyramid would be 36524 (100 times the number of days in a year) if measured in pyramid inches. Taylor and his followers, who included the Astronomer Royal of Scotland Charles Piazzi Smyth (1819\u20131900),C. Piazzi Smyth, Our inheritance in the Great Pyramid, with photograph, map, and plates (London, 1864). also found numerous apparent coincidences between the measurements of the pyramids and the geometry of the earth and the solar system.  They concluded that the British system of measures was derived from a far more ancient, if not divine, system.   During the 19th and early 20th centuries, this theory played a significant role in the debates over whether Britain and the United States should adopt the metric system.E. M.
