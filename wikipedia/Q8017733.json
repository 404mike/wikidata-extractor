He cuts off the ogre's hand with his sword and follows a trail of blood to a slab of marble that leads to a well. The youngest descends, finds three maidens in rooms. The third maiden, the most beautiful of the three, insists that her saviour goes before her, because she suspects a betrayal on the hero's brothers. The prince refuses, but she advises him to find a pair of sheep, one black and one white, and to jump onto the white one. Before she leaves the well, she gives him a nut with three dresses: one with the fields and their flowers, another with the sea and its fishes, and the third with the heaven and its stars. He is betrayed, jumps onto the black sheep and is taken deeper into the underworld to an old woman's house.

A cafezi advises him to pray to God and to cast his net in the sea. He marries his two elder daughters. When it is the youngest's turn, he catches a lobster in his net and gives it to his daughter as her husband. At first, the girl is sad, but the lobster reveals he is a prince and that the losbter is his ship (\"kanani\" in Modern Greek, similar to \"kananida\", a kind of lobster). He warns her  not to tell anything to her family. One day, she visits her family and watches over the lobster skin. Meanwhile, she sees outside a prince (her husband) appear three times, each on a more splendid horse and garments than the later. The third time, she tells the prince is her husband and he disappears. She then wears three leather dresses, three pairs of boots with rion soles, and goes on a quest for him. She meets three ogresses on the way, who help her and indicate the way to Melidoni. She meets a disguised Melidoni, who asks her for a kiss. She refuses and he turns her into a button, promising to take her to his mother. Once there, Melidoni changes her back and presents her to his mother. The ogress mother tells her to sweep and not sweep the floor of 40 rooms, to cook and not cook the meat for the ogress, and to fetch yeast from the house of the ogress's sister. She accomplishes it all with her husband's guidance.  Melidoni's mother betrothes him to another bride and tells the girl to fill many mattresses with feathers, to make a donkey dance, to feed the dog and to being back a loaf of bread untouched. Finally, on  the wedding day, the girl is forced to hold torches, bearing the pain of their burning, and - as her husband instructed the night before - throws them at the bride. They escape back to her father's house.Paton, W. R. \u201cFolktales from the \u00c6gean. [Continued].\u201d Folklore 12, no. 1 (1901): 84\u201393. http://www.jstor.org/stable/1252899."]}]}}
