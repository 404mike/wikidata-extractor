In 2008 Wadsworth's reporting triggered the resignation of Mayor of London Boris Johnson's spokesman.\nIn 2018 Wadsworth was expelled from the Labour Party for bringing the party into disrepute.

The article stated that Wadsworth was involved in a potentially criminal \"conspiracy to intimidate, threaten or harass Jewish activists into silence\" in an online meeting of the Labour in Exile Network. In reality Wadsworth had issued no such threats, had not attended the meeting and was not a member of the Labour in Exile Network. On 26 May 2021, the newspaper admitted the story was false in all respects, issued an apology, and agreed to pay damages. On 22 July 2021, the High Court of England and Wales found The Jewish Chronicle to be guilty of libelling Wadsworth in this matter. Following the libel verdict, Wadsworth said he was \"deeply distressed that The Jewish Chronicle did not check its facts or contact me before its article was written. Instead, it chose to publish serious and unfounded allegations, linking me with potential criminality, which go to the heart of my reputation as a journalist and long-standing campaigner against racism.\""]}, {"page": "Shapurji Saklatvala", "response": ["* Marc Wadsworth, Comrade Sak: Shapurji Saklatvala MP, A Political Biography,  Leeds, England: Peepal Tree Press, 1998.

Wadsworth proposed Cardinal Basil Hume's race advisor Leela Ramdeen as the other co-chair, to engage black faith groups. A number of Socialist Action members were put on the executive committee because of their campaigning abilities, including Redmond O'Neill and others later appointed advisers to Livingstone when he was Mayor of London.
