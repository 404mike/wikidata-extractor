He made his debut for the club on 18 August in a 1\u20130 defeat at Leyton Orient. He played in fifty games in 2007\u201308 before penning a new two-year deal in March. On 20 September 2008, he was sent off for the first time in his career. The match was a bad tempered affair at Brighton's Withdean Stadium, Weston was dismissed after 15 minutes and was followed by teammate Netan Sansara on 33 minutes, despite this a 44th minute Dwayne Mattis header earned the \"Saddlers\" a 1\u20130 win. Weston played 31 games that season and scored the third goal of his career on Boxing Day, a 64th-minute winner against Stockport County at the Bescot Stadium. He made thirty appearances in the 2009\u201310 season, before manager Chris Hutchings decided against offering him a fresh contract at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["Derby entered the September international break with just four points from their opening four games and with no wins in their last four games in all competitions. The club's owners faced recriminations from supporters over the sale of Rob Hulse (top scorer over the last two season) on transfer deadline day leaving no time to recruit an adequate replacement, leading Executive Chairman Tom Glick to defend the club's actions, stating \"We presented the offer to the manager and staff and they made the judgement from a footballing standpoint that this is an offer that was right to accept. Rob has been a great contributor and we acknowledge that when a player like Rob goes there will be disappointment. But ultimately I would have them [the fans] look at the squad Nigel has put together, take a look past the temporary injury situation and take a look at what we have in the squad and the style of football we are playing. And I would say have some faith that Nigel has done a very good job with recruitment and the results will be coming very soon. We firmly believe that.\" The squad was again suffering from injuries \u2013 Chris Porter (hip), Russell Anderson (groin), Stephen Pearson (knee) were all short term casualties, with Steve Davies (cruciate ligaments) and Miles Addison (foot) out for the season. In addition, Jake Buxton was fit enough only for the bench and Tomasz Cywka playing with a protective mask on after fracturing his cheekbone. Reigning Player of the Year Shaun Barker was also playing with a slight thigh strain. The club restated its intention to benefit from the loan system, saying \"There will be more and better players available on 7 September that were not available in the last window. That has to do Premier League's 25-man squad rule and Premier League sides holding on to guys just in case to make final decision\" The club revealed it had agreed a deal with West Bromwich Albion to sign Chris Wood on loan, but WBA's own injury problems forced them to pull the plug on any deal. Though Derby initially hoped to resurrect it at a later date, they instead bought in Swansea City's Shefki Kuqi on a three-month loan and Wood's West Brom teammate Luke Moore and Sunderland youngster Ryan Noble on 29-day deals. There was also interest in Leicester City's Matt Fryatt, Aston Villa's Shane Lowry and former England U18 defender Netan Sansara was taken on trial."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Dundee F.C. season", "response": ["|DF||||Netan Sansara"]}, {"page": "2017 FC Edmonton season", "response": ["| Netan Sansara", "| 27 ||  || DF || Netan Sansara                                       || 4 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 5 || 0"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Walsall F.C. season", "response": ["|Netan Sansara"]}]}}
