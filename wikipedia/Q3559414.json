He played as a loose forward, and was part of the Great Britain squad which won the 1960 World Cup. He forged a fearsome reputation as a strong runner of the ball and a devastating tackler. He was also highly regarded as a brilliant passer of the ball, often doing so with one of his large hands.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "England national rugby league team", "response": ["The following players played for England and are either British Rugby League Hall of Fame inductees, or are one of the top five caps, tries, goals, or points scorers for England.

Perhaps the golden era of the club came in the 1960s, as well as more lately in the Super League era. With a galaxy of stars including Tom van Vollenhoven, Alex Murphy, Dick Huddart, Cliff Watson, Ray French and Vince Karalius, the 1960s was a decade of great success for the Saints. In Prescott's first season as coach he lifted the Lancashire League in the 1959\u201360 season. During this decade, the recognisable 'red vee' strip first appeared in 1961 for the final against Wigan. St Helens won this epic 12\u20136, and the kit has since become synonymous with the club. Mick Sullivan joined Saints for \u00a311,000, then a record transfer fee. They won the Lancashire Cup in the 1961\u201362 season, with a 25\u20139 success over Swinton (at Central Park, Wigan) seeing yet more silverware come St Helens' way under the management of Prescott. After his departure in 1962, Stan McCormick led the club to retaining the Lancashire Cup in his first year, again beating Swinton; and St Helens made it a quadruplet of Lancashire Cup successes with wins against Leigh in 1964, and once more Swinton in 1965, the latter success under coach Joe Coan. St Helens won the Western Division Championship under McCormick's rule, beating Swinton 10\u20137. St Helens, under coach Joe Coan, lost the 1964\u201365 Championship final to Halifax at Station Road, Swinton. The 1965 New Zealand tourists appeared at Knowsley Road on Wednesday 15 September. Saints inflicted a 28\u20137 defeat on their visitors, their biggest loss of the tour. A League and Cup double was achieved under Coan in the 1965\u201366 season, whilst they lost the Floodlit Trophy final against Castleford. St Helens were beaten by Wakefield Trinity in the 1967 Rugby Football League Championship Final at Station Road, Swinton on 10 May 1967 by 20 points to 9 in a replay, after a 7\u20137 draw 4 days earlier.

In his first season, Widnes finished third in the Championship, which equalled the club's best league placing.
