The single, called \"Keep It Part Two (Inferiority Part One)\", was a failure, and five of the band members then quit, angered over continual personality problems with Rowland, as well as Rowland's policy of not speaking to the music press.  Archer and Paterson both remained with Rowland at first, but then Archer also decided to leave, which reduced Dexys to just Rowland and Paterson, whom Rowland referred to as \"the Celtic soul brothers\" (in reference to Paterson's Scottish background and Rowland's Irish background).\"Young Guns\" BBC interview, available at \"The Dexys Story\".", "While recording two new songs, \"Manhood\" and \"My Life in England\" (both credited to Rowland, Paterson, and David Ditchfield) for a forthcoming Dexys greatest hits album, Rowland recruited Welsh classical violist (and studio musician) Lucy J.

Following the sessions, Rowland offered Morgan a permanent place in the group, and she accepted.  With her addition, Rowland announced the reformation of Dexys in April 2003; he told Williams that his goal for the reformed band was to be true to the memory of Dexys but to \"take it somewhere else\".  The Dexys greatest hits album containing the new songs, Let's Make This Precious: The Best of Dexys Midnight Runners, was released on EMI in September 2003, followed by a successful tour 'to stop the burning' in October and November. The new songs on the album were touted as new singles, with Dexys even performing \"Manhood\" on Top of the Pops.  However, despite promotional single releases for each by EMI and airplay on national radio, neither was officially released as a commercial single. Instead, a live performance by this 2003 version of Dexys was released on DVD, entitled It Was Like This \u2013 Live (although some versions were packaged with a misleading picture of Rowland from the 1980s on the cover).
