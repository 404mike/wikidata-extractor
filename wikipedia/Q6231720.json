His musical and vocal education were furthered by the eminent harpsichordist George Malcolm, the then Director of Music. Under the name of John Hahessy ( his father was from Carrick-on-Suir, Co.Waterford, Ireland ) he had considerable success as a boy soprano - from BBC broadcasts and recordings with Decca to concerts with such conductors as Benjamin Britten. He made the 1st recording of Benjamin Britten's Canticle \"Abraham and Isaac\", singing the role of Isaac, accompanied by the composer. Britten later dedicated his \"Corpus Christi Carol\" to him. He went on to study at the Royal College of Music, and made his stage debut as a tenor in 1968 at The Proms.\nJohn Elwes is particularly well known for his sensitive and musical performances. His repertoire is extensive ranging from Monteverdi, Charpentier, Rameau, Bach and Handel to Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Mahler and Britten. He regularly performs with the leading conductors of baroque, classical and contemporary music. He has sung in over one hundred recordings, including Dowland's First Book of Ayres, Schubert's song cycles Die Sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin and Winterreise, Purcell's The Tempest, Bach's St Matthew Passion and Mass in B minor, Handel's Messiah and Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde, for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trevor Pinnock", "response": ["*Handel: Italian cantatas: Silete venti HWV 242; Cecilia, vogli un sguardo HWV 89 (Jennifer Smith, soprano; John Elwes, tenor) (1987)"]}, {"page": "Ren\u00e9 Jacobs", "response": ["*Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel: Tamerlano with John Elwes, Henri Ledroit, Mieke van der Sluis, Isabelle Poulenard, Gregory Reinhart, and La Grande Ecurie et La Chambre Du Roy conducted by Jean-Claude Malgoire \u2013 3 LP CBS Masterworks 1984"]}, {"page": "Das Lied von der Erde", "response": ["* Kenneth Slowik, with John Elwes, Russell Braun, Smithsonian Chamber Players & Santa Fe Pro Musica (Dorian Recordings)"]}, {"page": "Saul (Handel)", "response": ["||1997||Gregory Reinhart,Simone Kermes, Vasilijka Jezovsek,John Elwes,Matthias Koch,Michail Schelomjanskis,Johannes Kalpers||Peter Neumann, Collegium Cartusianum,K\u00f6lner Kammerchor||CD:MDG 332 0801-2"]}, {"page": "Les Indes galantes", "response": ["* 1974 \u2013 Gerda Hartman, Jennifer Smith (sopranos); Louis Devos, John Elwes (tenors); Philippe Huttenlocher (baritone).
