Feeling that Caroline does not want her there, Betty considers moving into a retirement home; however, she is convinced to stay in Weatherfield by her close friend Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire). Around the time of Betty's 40th anniversary at The Rovers Return, she is sacked by new manager Poppy Morales (Sophiya Haque) after clashing with her on several occasions. Landlord Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) eventually tires of Poppy's poor treatment of the staff and fires her. Betty is reinstated, and plays the fairy godmother in the 2009 Rovers Return Christmas pantomime performance of Cinderella. In early February 2010, Betty has a party in The Rovers Return celebrating both her 90th birthday and the fact that she is the oldest barmaid in Weatherfield; however, it backfires when 91-year-old Enid Crump (June Broughton) crashes the party and claims she is the oldest barmaid, not Betty. Later, Enid becomes sick after Steve serves her a three-month-old hotpot. Betty and Steve are left terrified when they realise that the hotpot could kill Enid, but she later recovers.
