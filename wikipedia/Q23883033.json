She studied for this at Newnham College under the supervision of G.L. Harriss, whose suggestion it had been, and it was awarded in March 1977. More recently, her interests have expanded into the relationship between local- and central government, the Black Death, medieval female authority, and queenship. As well as lecturing full-time at Cambridge, she also lectures privately and for high schools, and campaigned against the dissolution of the AS Level in 2013.During the 2012-15 controversy surrounding the burial place of the recently discovered bones of Richard III, she supported the claim of York to be the most fitting final resting place for the last Plantaganet king, saying that the dead king's \"self-identification with the North is reflected in his plans for a chantry of 100 priests in York Minster, where he surely hoped to be buried.\"She is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and General Editor of the Cambridgeshire Records Society. and is a general editor for The Parliament Rolls of Medieval England project, which transcribed, translated, and published digitally and in print, the Rolls of Parliament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Rosemary Horrox"]}, {"page": "William Stubbs", "response": ["In the main Stubbs' ideas of a confrontational political framework have been superseded by K.

Although a Yorkist victory, Sir James and his father, along with Warwick's brother John Neville were captured after the battle, at Acton Bridge, and sent to Chester Castle.

Edward duly did so, to Thomas, Lord Stanley in November 1461, but James and his brother Sir Robert, in attempt to keep the inheritance for the family, effectively disallowed the King's grant and imprisoned (or, kept in custody) the two girls, as Anthony Goodman noted, \"contrary to their will, in divers places.\" Along with the girls, Sir James also seized Hornby castle, Lonsdale, which was the chief residence contained in the inheritance,Ross, C., Edward IV, London 1975, p. 408 but which also included Brierley, and some manors originally granted him by his father's feoffees, including George Neville, in 1463.Goodman, A., The Wars of the Roses, New York 1981, p. 98 The dispute was more complicated than merely theft and kidnapping. Harrington claimed that, in law, his father's estates were held in tail male, in which case they could only be passed through the male line and the actions of Sir Thomas's feoffees would be illegal, and the inheritance remain with him; Stanley, however, claimed them to be held in fee simple, viz through the female line as well.Pollard, A.J., North Eastern England During the Wars of the Roses: : Lay Society, War, and Politics 1450\u20131500, Oxford 1990, p. 325 In October 1466, Stanley obtained a grant to sue in the King's Court, but the matter was not dealt with until 1468, when a commission found against HarringtonRosemary Horrox, 'Harrington family (per. c.1300\u20131512)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 28 October 2013 and he and his brother were committed- \"temporarily\", Ross noted- to the Fleet Prison.Ross, C., Edward IV, London 1975, p. 408", "His connection with Gloucester, who aided him in his feud with Stanley,Ross, C., Richard III, St. Ives (repr.) 1990, p. 51 in late 1469, when the duke of Gloucester, as he then was, was appointed forester of Amounderness, Blackburn, and Bowland, and Harrington was Steward of Amournderness hundred.

Certainly by 1446 he was deputy steward of Amounderness castle- the steward was York's ally, Richard, Earl of Salisbury, one of the greatest northern magnates of the time. Further, he stood with Salisbury's sons, Thomas and John Neville in their feud with sons of the earl of Northumberland in the Percy\u2013Neville feud, and in November 1455, he acted as a nominee for the appointment of one of Salisbury's men as Sheriff in Yorkshire.Griffiths, R.A., The Reign of Henry VI (Berkeley, 1981), p.770 n.211"]}, {"page": "Christopher Conyers (bailiff of Richmond)", "response": ["The son and heir of John Conyers of Hornby (d. c. 1412), he married Ellen, the daughter of Roleston in November 1415.

Between his two wives he produced twenty-five children, twelve being sons; 'unusually,' notes Rosemary Horrox, he was able to provide for many of his younger sons, rather than just the eldest, as was usual. Horrox puts this down to the fact that his heir had married the daughter and coheir of Philip, Lord Darcy, which provided Conyers with a source of income, as well as the fact that he arranged good marriages for many of them. His ability to do so, she continues, demonstrates his 'good standing' in the region.

Later that year his father and brother appointed Thomas their deputy on the West March, where they were joint Wardens. For this he received a salary of 500 marks \u2013 which, R.L. Storey points out, was \"less than a quarter of their official salary\". A few months later, he stood as surety for his uncle William, Lord Fauconberg's good behaviour (whom Michael Hicks speculates may have been involved in piracy at this time). By 1459 the domestic political situation had descended into outright civil war; when the earl of Salisbury marched south from his castle at Middleham in September to join up with the duke of York at Ludlow, Thomas marched with him in a 5,000-strong army. On 23 September 1459, they encountered a larger royal force at Blore Heath, which Salisbury defeated, killing its leader, James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley. Thomas and John, though, were somehow captured near Tarporley, Cheshire, the next day. Hicks has suggested that this was due to their being wounded in battle and sent home; Rosemary Horrox on the other hand posits that they ventured too far from the main army in pursuit of fleeing Lancastrians. Attainted in the Parliament of Devils the next month, they were imprisoned in Chester Castle and not released until their brother Warwick was victorious at the Battle of Northampton in June 1460.  Thomas Neville was appointed, jointly with his father, to Keeper of the Royal Mews as part of the Nevilles' policy of filling the positions of political importance with their own sympathisers.; Hicks has called it \"decidedly a Neville dominated regime\". He was immediately, on his release, appointed to commissions to arrest and imprison any who disturbed the peace, and received grants of Duchy of Lancaster estates at the same time.  When the duke of York joined them and claimed the throne in October 1460, the Nevilles were as set against his claim as every other member of the nobility present for the coming parliament. Thomas Neville appears to have been fundamental to Salisbury's resistance to York's claims: possibly with Warwick, it was certainly Thomas who met York at Westminster Palace (where he had evicted the King from his lodgings), and informed the duke that his position was untenable \"to both lords and people\"; According to P.A. Johnson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Bourchier refused to confront the duke of York, so on two occasions \"Thomas Neville was sent instead\". Two days later, on 13 October 1460, he again went to York: \"whatever was then said is unknown, but Neville's mandate must have been both blunt and bluntly delivered\". York acquiesced to a compromise."]}, {"page": "Horrox", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rosemary Horrox"]}, {"page": "John Minsterworth", "response": ["Landing at Calais, the army commenced a chevauch\u00e9e across northern and southwestern France to Bordeaux. This probably had the strategic intention of drawing the French away from Aquitaine where the Black Prince was about to begin another campaign with the Earl of Pembroke. By November 1370, Minsterworth had rebelled at Knolles's leadership and became the leader of the malcontents. Although at this time Knolles was a soldier of \"great fame\", says Rosemary Horrox, Minsterworth clearly did not appreciate or respect him or his abilities, and she describes the former's actions as clearly mutinous. Michael Prestwich has suggested that his eventual desertion from Knolles's army was encouraged by the fact that so much had already gone wrong for Knolles's attempted chevauch\u00e9e. It has also been suggested that Knolles irritated his fellow captains by keeping for himself a disproportionally large amount of the ransoms collected. The tactical and military failures of the campaign were deemed as being the result of Knolles's personal misjudgements and inexperience.
