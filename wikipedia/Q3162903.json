Just several weeks later manager Terry Bullivant was sacked and replaced by Tommy Burns who soon fell out with several players including Legg and Bowen. Burns ignored the group of players, who later became known as the \"gang of five\", and refused to let them be a part of the first team, resulting in them taking part in separate training sessions taken charge of by reserve team manager Alan Pardew, who took over from Burns following his dismissal. Pardew later commented that \"\"I wish they had stayed. Andy would certainly be in my team now and Jason showed he had a lot of talent.\""]}, {"page": "Matt Green (footballer)", "response": ["Several teams watched him while he played for Newport, including Bristol City, Reading, Stoke City and Swansea City, but instead Green joined Cardiff City in January 2007 for a fee of \u00a310,000 with possible add-ons depending on appearances.
