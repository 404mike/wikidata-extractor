According to manager Graham Turner, the player seemed reluctant initially to play in the fourth tier of English football but was won over by the club's ambition. Sadler made his Shrewsbury Town debut in the opening game of the season, in a 3 \u2013 1 win over Bradford City. In the next game, Sadler played a role for the club when he provided assist for Matt Harrold to score the only goal in the game in a 1\u20130 win over Macclesfield Town. Since then, Sadler made an impressive display at Shrewsbury Town, having established himself in the first team and expressed interests of extending his loan spell at the club for the remainder of the season. On 6 January 2011 saw Sadler's loan spell at Shrewsbury Town extended until the end of the season. During the match against Port Vale on 8 March 2011, Sadler controversially fouled Tom Pope in a penalty box, leading to a penalty kick converted successfully, which resulted a 2\u20132 draw. Despite this, Sadler went on to be an ever-present player in the League Two season to play every minute of every game for his club. Sadler played in two matches in the play\u2013offs against Torquay United, but lost 2\u20130 in the first leg and drew 0\u20130 in the second leg."]}, {"page": "Lewis Price", "response": ["He then started nearly every game ahead of first choice keeper Shane Supple. In the 2006\u201307 season, just a week after Petr \u010cech and Carlo Cudicini sustained horrific injuries which brought up an argument that goalkeepers need more protection, Price was injured in Ipswich's 3\u20131 victory over Southend United. Price had to be stretchered off after colliding with Matt Harrold."]}, {"page": "Michael Reddy", "response": ["In July 2004 Reddy signed for Grimsby Town as one of the first new signings under the newly installed manager Russell Slade. He was a huge signing for the cash strapped and relegation hit club, as well as the addition of winger Andy Parkinson who had joined the club a few days previously. Reddy's first season was somewhat disappointing as the player was still recovering from a medial ligament injury and struggled to regain full fitness. Despite this Reddy was utilised as Town's favoured striker, mainly playing alongside Martin Gritton, Matt Harrold or Colin Cramb throughout this season. Notably though he did finish the season on a high scoring a hat trick against already doomed Kidderminster Harriers. He managed 9 goals throughout the season which was seen as a slightly disappointing season for all at the club, having seen the club finish in a lowly 18th place."]}, {"page": "James Lawson (footballer)", "response": ["He was unable to establish himself in the first team at the beginning of the 2006\u201307 season and joined League Two side Grimsby Town in September 2006 on a one-month loan. He made only one appearance as a substitute and was recalled by Southend with manager Steve Tilson explaining, \"James was there for two matches and only played about 20 minutes We wanted him to get games and that wasn't happening, so he has come back to us now.\" Lawson was still unable to break into the first team, being behind Freddy Eastwood, Matt Harrold, Lee Bradbury and Gary Hooper for a place in the team, and joined AFC Bournemouth in January 2007 on a month's loan, where he started two games and came on as substitute in two games.

Forwards Matt Harrold, Charlie MacDonald, Gary Hooper and Richie Foran were transfer listed. Darryl Flahavan and Mark Gower both turned down new contracts to sign for Championship sides Crystal Palace and Swansea City respectively. Simon Francis, Peter Clarke and Nicky Bailey were also later placed on the transfer list after failing to agree new contracts at the club. Francis later agreed and signed a new two-year deal. Bailey was being chased by Championship side Charlton Athletic, Bailey put in a man of the match display on Southend's opening game of the season against Peterborough United which was being watched by the London club, the game proved to be Bailey's last for Southend and signed for Charlton 3 days later for \u00a3500,000 which could rise to \u00a3750,000.

The away side fielded a strong team, which included 10 players capped at international level. Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney were amongst the starting line up, along with Gabriel Heinze, Darren Fletcher, Wes Brown and Alan Smith. Southend had injuries to strikers Billy Paynter and Lee Bradbury while Matt Harrold was cup tied so boss Steve Tilson partnered Gary Hooper up front with Freddy Eastwood. After 25 minutes Jamal Campbell-Ryce was fouled by David Jones 30 yards from goal, Kevin Maher, Steven Hammell and Freddy Eastwood stood over the free kick, Eastwood curled \"a wonderful free-kick around the wall and into the top corner past Tomasz Kuszczak\" as the BBC reported. Southend held on for one of the most famous victories in the club's history. Since this was the only meeting between the two sides to date, Southend are one of the only sides to have a 100% record against the Red Devils (along with Zenit St Petersburg, Vasco de Gama and Bootle Reserves). The latter defeated Newton Heath, the original name of Manchester United, in the 1890/91 FA Cup 2nd qualifying round.", "After seeing off Barnsley in the FA Cup Southend were once again drawn away to Spurs on 27 January 2007. Robbie Keane gave the hosts the lead after 13 minutes which looked to be the start of a rout, Southend defended well and were able to see out the half still only the one goal down. Jermaine Jenas added a 2nd for Spurs shortly after the interval. Southend were given a life line and a route back into the game when a Matt Harrold shot was handled in the area by Hossam Ghaly, Freddy Eastwood stepped up to take the spot kick and confidently sent Radek Cerny the wrong way. Southend's hopes of an unlikely comeback were put to bed just 5 minutes later when Mido restored Spurs 2 goal advantage. Gary Hooper had a good chance to pull a goal back for Southend in injury time after lifting the ball over the goalkeeper but also over the crossbar."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Football League Two", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Matt Harrold"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": [" Stevenage stretched their unbeaten run to seven games after a 1\u20131 home draw with Shrewsbury Town.
