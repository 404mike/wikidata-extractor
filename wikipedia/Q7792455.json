The maze was replanted with yew trees as part of the 2005 regeneration project to the original plans laid by Wailes. Also renovated was Saltwell Dene, a picturesque wooded area with a stream, bridges, cascades and a lily pond which inspired local artist Thomas Miles Richardson to paint a watercolour of it in the 19th\u00a0century. Saltwell Dene was the final part of the 21st\u00a0century restoration project to be completed, reopening to the public in March 2005. At either end of the Broadwalk there are two wooden shelters whilst the centre of the Broadwalk is marked by the Almond Pavilion. The pavilion was opened in 1881 and was a refreshment pavilion for decades before it fell into disrepair; by the 1980s it was derelict and it was then completely destroyed by fire. It has been fully reconstructed, including a replica of the original clock tower, and is once more a refreshment kiosk with new toilet facilities. It offers panoramic views into the northern fields and across the boating lake. An oriental garden was opened in 2011 to mark the twenty-year anniversary of the twinning arrangement between Gateshead and Komatsu. This includes a gravel pond, waterfalls and stone lanterns. The park is also host to three well-used bowling greens, replete with their own pavilion (the Avenue Green Pavilion) and a rose garden."]}, {"page": "Sheriff Hill", "response": ["Sheriff Hill is  south of Gateshead town centreWhellan, 1855: 388 and  from London.

He contributed in all about five hundred drawings to the society's exhibitions, about half of which appeared during Copley Fielding's presidency (1831\u20131855). A dozen of these were painted in collaboration with the younger George Barret (d. 1842), and one, \u2018The Favourites,\u2019 with Thomas Miles Richardson On the death of Fielding in 1855 Tayler, as senior member of the committee of management, was vice-president for the year, and discharged the duties of president during the interregnum of eight months which, out of respect for Fielding's memory, was allowed to pass before the election of his successor. In his official capacity Tayler became a member of the fine arts committee for the Paris Exhibition of 1855, as well as one of the jury. On his arrival in Paris, however, the hanging of the pictures was practically completed. He was nevertheless fiercely attacked in connection with some alleged unfairness, notably as regards the works of John Frederick Lewis. His distress at this affair brought on a serious illness, from the effects of which he did not finally recover until peace was restored in the society by the election of Lewis as president."]}, {"page": "Henry Perlee Parker", "response": ["Newcastle had a reputation for the artistic merit of its book illustration and printing industries, and Parker became acquainted with two exponents: Thomas Bewick (1753\u20131828) and Thomas Miles Richardson(1784\u20131848). An engraving by G. Armstrong of Eccentric Characters of Newcastle 'became exceedingly popular'.Welford, Men of Mark. p. 250. When Brandling became MP for Northumberland, in 1820, he commission a portrait by Parker that was engraved.See here for the proof copy in the British Museum.

A Strange Business:  Making Art and Money in Nineteenth-Century Britain. London: Atlantic Books. p. 21. Brandling commissioned further work over the next few years, and most importantly the relationship gave Parker an entr\u00e9e into Tyneside society.", "Parker and Thomas Miles Richardson formed a close friendship, and in response to the absence of public exhibiting space in Newcastle they planned an annual art exhibition. Drawing from their experience of London exhibiting organisations, it was to be called the Northumberland Institution for the Promotion of the Fine Arts, and in September 1882 the first exhibition was held, in Richardson\u2019s modest studios at Brunswick Place.Hedley, Gill (early 1980s). \u2018Artists in Newcastle upon Tyne 1820\u20131900\u2019.

One of the \u2018connoisseurs\u2019 on the committee was the local naturalist Henry Hewitson, and he commissioned Parker to paint a picture of Hewitson's circle on an expedition, known as The Cullercoats Party.Also known as A Party Embarking For a Cruize from Cullercoats, this work has been dated as c.1818; however, the presence of Robert Bell (mayor of Newcastle in 1822) and that the earliest newspaper reviews date from 1823 make 1822 more likely. The attractive seaside setting and identifiable documentary details make the work characteristics of Parker's now mature style."]}, {"page": "Edward Goodall", "response": ["While landscape engraving was his speciality, he also executed figure subjects, some after the paintings of his son Frederick Goodall.

A notable example is Turner's watercolour The Old Mill, Ambleside (1798), which includes Stock Ghyll.
