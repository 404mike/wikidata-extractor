He was known for his safe handling, lightning reflexes and his graceful style, for which he was given the nickname \"The Cat\". He was one of several goalkeepers (Gordon West of Everton was another) who specialised in a one-armed throw which could achieve a similar distance to a drop kick.\nBonetti played seven times for England, but mainly served the team as a back-up to Gordon Banks; he was part of the winning England squad for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but did not play. He belatedly received a winners' medal in 2009, after the Football Association led a successful campaign for non-playing members of the squad to be recognised. After Banks fell ill before the 1970 FIFA World Cup quarter-final, Bonetti played as England lost 3\u20132 to West Germany.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chelsea F.C.", "response": ["Chelsea's highest appearance-maker is ex-captain Ron Harris, who played in 795 competitive games for the club between 1961 and 1980.For the appearance and goalscoring records of all Chelsea players, see  Four other players made more than 500 appearances for the club: Peter Bonetti (729; 1959\u201379), John Terry (717; 1998\u20132017), Frank Lampard (648; 2001\u20132014) and John Hollins (592; 1963\u20131975 and 1983\u20131984).

He found the heat and altitude at Guadalajara, Mexico difficult to cope with. The team's efforts at acclimatisation were not helped when Bobby Moore was falsely accused of stealing the infamous \"Bogot\u00e1 Bracelet\". Despite this, a Geoff Hurst goal was enough to beat their first opponents, Romania. A far tougher test awaited on 7 June, when England faced Brazil. The day before the match Banks was informed that he had been awarded an OBE.", "The day before the game England's hopes of making further inroads into the World Cup were dented when Banks started to complain of an upset stomach. He became affected by violent stomach cramps and aching limbs, and spent his time in the bathroom sweating, shivering and vomiting. He passed an extremely undemanding fitness test but suffered a relapse shortly before the game and Ramsey was forced to rest him and play Peter Bonetti in his place. Ramsey remarked that \"of all the players to lose, we had to lose him.\" Banks watched the game on television at the hotel as England lost a two-goal lead to be eliminated 3\u20132 after extra time; due to a time delay on the broadcast he switched the television off with England 2\u20130 in the lead as Bobby Moore returned to the hotel to break the news of the defeat. Conspiracies later surfaced that Banks had been poisoned to take him out of the game, but with no evidence to support them Banks never believed in these conspiracies."]}, {"page": "September 27", "response": ["*1941 \u2013 Peter Bonetti, English footballer and coach (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "Crewe Alexandra F.C.", "response": ["All-time records were set against First Division Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup fourth round in 1960.

At 2\u20131 Ramsey had substituted Bobby Charlton and Martin Peters, supposedly to rest them for the semi-final, in what was considered a tactical blunder. The blame for the defeat was partly placed on Ramsey's cautious tactics and substitutions in searing Mexican heat and partly on the stand-in goalkeeper, Chelsea's Peter Bonetti. At 2\u20130 up Bonetti, who was playing because regular keeper Gordon Banks had been taken ill, had let a seemingly innocuous shot by Franz Beckenbauer slip under his body and was then caught out of position by a looping header by Uwe Seeler.

His second England cap came in a goalless draw against Wales at Wembley; and his first competitive match for his country was his third appearance as England drew 1\u20131 with Switzerland in a qualifying game for the 1972 European Championships. At this stage, Banks was still England's first choice keeper, but the remaining brace of back-ups from the 1970 World Cup, Peter Bonetti and Alex Stepney, had been cast aside by Ramsey so Shilton could begin to regard himself as his country's number two goalkeeper at the age of 22. His fourth and fifth England caps came towards the end of 1972, before a tragic incident suddenly saw Shilton propelled into the limelight as England's number one keeper. In October 1972, Gordon Banks was involved in a car crash which resulted in the loss of the sight in one eye and thus ended his career. Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence was called up to make his debut a month later for England's opening qualifier for the 1974 World Cup, (a 1\u20130 win over Wales).

England had taken a 2\u20130 lead in the game through goals from Alan Mullery and Martin Peters. Franz Beckenbauer had pulled a goal back for West Germany before the substitution. Following the substitution of Charlton and another substitution (Peters was replaced by Norman Hunter), the Germans scored twice (Uwe Seeler and Gerd M\u00fcller were the scorers). Bell was involved in creating chances for England following his introduction. At one point in the game, Bell sent in a low cross to the near post, but Hurst headed the ball just wide of the far one. At another point in the game, Bell beat Beckenbauer in the German penalty area and was then knocked down by the German player, but England were not awarded a penalty.  The substitution was deemed by some to be the negative (for England) turning point of the game. However, West Germany scored their first goal before Charlton was substituted, and the fact that the German team at the time had a habit of coming back in games indicates that it was questionable to blame the substitutions for England's defeat. West Germany were subsequently defeated by Italy 4\u20133 in the semi final. Italy were eventually defeated 4\u20131 by Brazil in the final. Charlton asserted that the absence of Gordon Banks (he was replaced in goal by Peter Bonetti) through sickness was the most important factor in England's defeat to the West Germans.  Similarly, Glanville argued that \"had Banks played, England would surely have won\".  Geoff Hurst stated that \"to suggest that Colin Bell's inclusion weakened the team is patently unfair\".
