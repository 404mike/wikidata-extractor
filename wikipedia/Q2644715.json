He was admitted a solicitor in 1860, and moved to Liverpool, where he became partner in the law firm of Oliver Jones, Billson, and Company.  He became a J.P. for the city, and was active in local Liberal politics as secretary of South West Lancashire Liberal Association from 1866 to 1884, and of Liverpool's Liberal Association.Billson was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for three different constituencies: from 1892 to 1895 for Barnstaple in Devon, from a by-election in 1897 to the 1900 General Election for Halifax in West Yorkshire, and from the 'Liberal landslide' 1906 General Election, until his death in 1907, for North West Staffordshire, after defeating a Conservative Member. He had also unsuccessfully contested Conservative-held Bradford East in 1896, being defeated by the Honourable Ronald Greville.\nBillson married in 1862 Lilla, daughter of John Baines of Leicester, and had one son and three daughters.Later in his life he began to live in Shropshire at Rowton Castle as tenant of its then landlord, Baron Rowton, with whom he enjoyed friendship despite political differences, Rowton having been a close Conservative associate of Disraeli.  He was an active supporter of Liberal associations in the mainly Conservative-voting county, and served as member of the Atcham Rural District Council and Alberbury Parish Council.In June 1907 he was knighted in King Edward VII's Birthday Honours List although he did not live to receive the accolade.  He died suddenly, on 9 July 1907, in the House of Commons when he collapsed in the 'Aye' lobby to cast his vote on sugar duty legislation, aged 68.  After cremation at Golders Green Crematorium, his ashes were buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. A future Liberal MP, Congregationalist minister Silvester Horne, officiated.  A plaque was placed in his memory in St Michael's Parish Church, Alberbury, near his Rowton Castle home.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Golders Green Crematorium", "response": ["* Sir Alfred Billson (1839-1907), Liberal MP, ashes buried at Kensal Green Cemetery."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: B", "response": ["*Sir Alfred Billson (1892-1907)"]}, {"page": "Halifax (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Alfred Billson"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Alfred Billson, Liberal MP 1892\u201395, 1897\u20131900 & 1906\u201307."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["* 3 March: Halifax - Alfred Billson, Liberal, replacing William Rawson Shaw"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Alfred Billson"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|Alfred Billson"]}, {"page": "Barnstaple (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Alfred Billson"]}, {"page": "North West Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Alfred Billson", "thumb|120px|Alfred Billson"]}, {"page": "Sir James Heath, 1st Baronet", "response": ["He was Member of Parliament for North West Staffordshire from 1892 to the 1906 General Election when he lost in the Liberal landslide to Sir Alfred Billson.
