The Cass Sculpture Foundation wrote about Jones' work that \"on a flat canvas, painted forms appear sculptural and his three-dimensional works are painterly. He uses colour to describe form, at times with graphic precision, or conversely with an energy and freedom of gesture which is close to direct expression. Similar developments are evident in his printmaking.\" The Tate has described his output in lithography as \"prolific,\" writing that it \"proved an appropriate medium for his graphic flair.\" Artists and pop fashion designers such as Alexander McQueen, Issey Miyake and Richard Nicoll have cited Jones as an influence on their own styles."]}, {"page": "List of fashion designers", "response": ["* Richard Nicoll"]}, {"page": "Elle Style Awards", "response": ["*Young Designer of the Year: Richard Nicoll"]}, {"page": "Fall 2008 fashion weeks", "response": ["| Richard Nicoll || February 13 || ||"]}, {"page": "Jack Wills", "response": ["In February 2014, it was announced that fashion designer Richard Nicoll was to become the new creative director of Jack Wills, to come into effect Spring 2015.
