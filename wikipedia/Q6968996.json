First in was former Wales under-21 winger Nathan Craig.  Currently a free agent, Craig had impressed Ling while playing for the reserves and was offered what amounted to an extended trial until the end of the season. Another new face arrived in the shape of defender Angus MacDonald who was brought in on loan from Reading for the rest of the season. The new players had yet to make an appearance before Torquay's run of good form came to a shuddering halt with a surprise 2\u20131 defeat at Plainmoor to struggling Bradford City.  Fans may well have been wondering if they were feeling the delayed effects of the Manager of the Month 'curse' when the Gulls suffered a second successive loss away to Gillingham.  The 2\u20130 defeat at Priestfield ended in bizarre circumstances with the assistant referee flagging for a penalty when Brian Saah had seemingly brought down former Gulls-loanee Gavin Tomlin in the penalty box.  However, referee Jock Waugh (who had originally waved play-on) decided to send off Joe Oastler instead of Saah.  However, following an appeal, the FA rectified the error and the one-match ban was switched from Oastler to Saah.", "|Nathan Craig"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["|7 || MF ||  || 20 || Nathan Craig || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|20 ||  || MF || Nathan Craig || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["|Nathan Craig"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Welsh Premier League", "response": ["|  Nathan Craig", "| Nathan Craig"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Cymru Premier", "response": ["|  Nathan Craig"]}]}}
