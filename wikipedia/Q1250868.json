In her later career Jacques showed \"a comic talent of extraordinary versatility. In Sykes her performance had to be a foil for the main character; in the Carry Ons she blossomed\". As a singer she was also praised; Jonathan Cecil of The Spectator said that her \"bell-tone voice with its cut-crystal diction\u2014perfect for radio\u2014had an edge of pain which suggested a greater depth to her talents than she was generally allowed to express\".
