Beiser writes that while Strawson is the most notable commentator to have argued that the central arguments of Kant's Analytic can be separated from Kant's transcendental psychology and transcendental idealism, his interpretation of the Deduction leaves unresolved questions. He notes that Kant himself rejected a reading of the kind proposed by Strawson. Lowe writes that while The Bounds of Sense is widely admired, Strawson is \"seen by some as being unduly dismissive of Kant's doctrine of transcendental idealism\" and over-optimistic in his \"suggestion that many of the central arguments of Kant's critical philosophy can survive\" its repudiation. Baldwin writes that Strawson's critics have argued that Strawson's attempt to separate Kant's conclusions \"concerning the presuppositions of objective experience and judgment\" from his transcendental idealism leads to an unstable position. In their view, transcendental arguments \"can tell us only what we must suppose to be the case\", meaning that \"if Kant's idealism, which restricts such suppositions to things as they appear to us, is abandoned, we can draw conclusions concerning the way the world itself must be only if we add the verificationist thesis that ability to make sense of such suppositions requires ability to verify them.\""]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* E.
