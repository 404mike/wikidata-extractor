Then, Welsh physicist Granville Beynon became involved and by 1975, the agreement was signed, with the UK as a member. The proposal for UK membership had originally been turned down by the appropriate SRC committee. Beynon, however, persuaded the Board to reverse the decision of the committee and as a result of his efforts, hundreds of European scientists have had the opportunity to use the world's most advanced ionospheric radar."]}, {"page": "Dunvant", "response": ["*Sir Granville Beynon (1914-1996), physicist."]}, {"page": "List of people from Swansea", "response": ["*Sir Granville Beynon, FRS, physicist"]}, {"page": "1996 in Wales", "response": ["*11 March - Sir Granville Beynon, physicist, 81"]}, {"page": "1914 in Wales", "response": ["**Sir Granville Beynon, physicist, (d. 1996)"]}, {"page": "Tor Hagfors", "response": ["* 2002 EISCAT's Sir Granville Beynon medal"]}, {"page": "Beynon", "response": ["*Granville Beynon (1914-1996), Welsh physicist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| William John Granville Beynon||15/03/1973||24 May 1914 \u2013 11 March 1996"]}, {"page": "Deaths in 1996", "response": ["*Granville Beynon, Welsh physicist (b. 1914)"]}, {"page": "1976 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*William John Granville Beynon, C.B.E., F.R.S., Professor of Physics, University College of Wales."]}, {"page": "William John Granville Beynon", "response": ["#REDIRECTGranville Beynon"]}, {"page": "Cathryn Mitchell", "response": ["Mitchell studied physics at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.
