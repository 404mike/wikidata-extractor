He served as the inaugural President of the Australian Senate from 1901 to 1906.

In 1892, Richard Baker called him a \"coward, a bully and a disgrace to the legal profession\" in the Legislative Council and Kingston replied by calling Baker \"false as a friend, treacherous as a colleague, mendacious as a man, and utterly untrustworthy in every relationship of public life\".
