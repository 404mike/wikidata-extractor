D. Sheehan and his Irish Land and Labour Association, which became his new platform for renewed political activity. In addition O'Brien supported both the 1904 devolution scheme and the 1907 Irish Council Bill, a bill rejected by the UIL, as a step in the right direction, or \"Home Rule by instalments\". These involvements inflamed the Dillonite section of the IPP to the extent that they were determined to destroy both O'Brien and Sheehan \"before they poison the whole country\"O'Brien, Joseph V.: p.170 and published regular denunciations of their conciliatory policies in the IPP's Freeman's Journal. By 1907, there were seven MPs outside the parliamentary party. Proposals to reunite the party were made by Redmond and a meeting summoned for the Mansion House, Dublin, in April 1908.Sheehan, D.

This time he was hounded out by Devlin's Molly Maguire baton troops, a wing of the Hibernian Order, on the occasion of the rigged Dublin National Convention in February 1909, called the \"Baton Convention\", in a dispute over the financial arrangements for the next stage of the 1909 Land Purchase Act.O'Brien, Joseph V.: p.187 As a consequence, O'Brien next founded his new political movement, the All-for-Ireland League, which returned eight independent MPs in the December 1910 general elections."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|D.
