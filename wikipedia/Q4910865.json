He worked in politics and in law before becoming an organiser with the Australian Workers' Union (AWU) in 1994. He was elected State Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the AWU in 1998 before becoming AWU National Secretary in 2001. In this role, Shorten played a prominent role as a negotiator following the Beaconsfield Mine collapse in 2006, which first brought him to national prominence.\nShorten was elected to the House of Representatives in 2007 for the Division of Maribyrnong and was immediately appointed a Parliamentary Secretary. Following the 2010 election, he was promoted to the Cabinet, serving first as Assistant Treasurer, then as Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Workplace Relations in the Gillard Government. In 2013, he was briefly Minister for Education until the defeat of the Rudd Government that year.\nShorten stood in the subsequent leadership election against Anthony Albanese, the first such election that allowed a vote of party members as well as Members of Parliament, and was declared the winner on 13 October 2013. Shorten led Labor to gain 14 seats at the 2016 election, with the Coalition retaining its majority by just one seat.
