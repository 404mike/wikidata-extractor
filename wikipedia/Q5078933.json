He founded Boxfoldia in Birmingham in 1920, a company that was finally sold in 2003.In 1940, he put \u00a37,000 (equivalent to \u00a3385,000 in 2019) into a trust for general charitable objectives, including medical and educational facilities and housing for the working classes. Trustees were drawn from the City Council, the University of Birmingham and from the founder's family, and additional advisors were nominated from the company.  The trust had an annual income of \u00a35,500 by 1952 (equivalent to \u00a3159,400 in 2019). The C. H. Foyle Trust later adapted its memorandum to support educational, recreational and artistic activities of a charitable nature, with an emphasis on those from deprived areas in the West Midlands, with an income of \u00a3148,683 in 2008 (equivalent to \u00a3199,868 in 2019). Over its seventy years, the Trust supported many individuals and schools and hundreds of charitable organisations, in both educational and other fields, with grants ranging from a few tens to many thousands of pounds. Major beneficiaries have included the Midlands Arts Centre, the Bramall Music Building at the University of Birmingham, the Birmingham Museum and Arts Gallery for the Staffordshire Hoard, and Selly Oak Hospital for the Uli Nimptsch statue, Compassion.\nCharles Henry Foyle was born in Hoxton, London. His brothers William and Gilbert Foyle founded Foyles bookshop in London.

Although Charles Henry Foyle is described by some as the \"inventor\" of the paper carton, mass production of the cartons was invented, partly by accident, at the Robert Gair Company in Brooklyn, New York. Machinery at the end of the press had been set up carelessly by a pressman, and machinery cut through the material. This ruined the press but gave them an idea: printing and cutting could be done with one machine. Previously, cutting of printed cardboard had been done manually. From the mistake in 1879, Gair developed a process for mass production of boxes. In 1897, the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) became the first large company to adopt the new cartons, for Uneeda Biscuits. Other manufacturers soon followed. With inexpensive packaging now even common items could be placed in a showy carton and each carton became its own advertisement. The product was also protected, and the contents had a longer shelf life. This trend was to continue with force, through the 20th century. This could be seen as a contributing factor in the so-called 'throwaway' culture of America. The environmental impact of product packaging has gained attention from consumers and businesses alike, and this awareness has created a steady trend since the mid to late 1990s, on the part of manufacturers, to use recycled material and/or reduce overall materials usage."]}, {"page": "List of British innovations and discoveries", "response": ["*Folding carton \u2013 Charles Henry Foyle"]}, {"page": "Foyle (surname)", "response": ["* Charles Henry Foyle (died 1948), English businessperson; inventor of the folding carton"]}]}}
