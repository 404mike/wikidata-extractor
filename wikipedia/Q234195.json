They were Harry Hanson and his Court players, and Frank H. Fortescue's Famous Players, with Arthur Brough in Folkestone for the South. Their system was the toughest of all, for if you joined one of their companies, it could mean \"twice-nightly\" shows, and a new play to learn every week. Rosemary Harris has told of her 50 consecutive weeks of doing just that at Bedford rep. That cannot happen anymore, owing to the restrictions of British Equity, which came to mandate just eight shows a week, including perhaps two matin\u00e9es. Fortescue, who died in 1957, was known to be a strict and upright man. When Pygmalion was playing at one of his theatres, the sign \"FOR ADULTS ONLY!\" would be posted in the front of house, because of Eliza Doolittle's line \"Not bloody likely!\".", "Examples of performers who went on to universal recognition are Michael Caine, Michael Gambon, Laurence Olivier, Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Imelda Staunton, and Patrick Stewart. Along with Errol Flynn, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Jeremy Brett, Rosemary Harris, Peter O'Toole, Christopher Plummer, Harold Pinter, Lynn Redgrave, Arthur Lowe, Vanessa Redgrave, Geraldine McEwan and Ronnie Barker. Dirk Bogarde wrote about his start at tiny Amersham rep in 1939, and Michael Caine has recounted his time spent at Horsham rep in the early fifties."]}, {"page": "Wuthering Heights", "response": ["In 1958, an adaptation aired on CBS television as part of the series DuPont Show of the Month starring Rosemary Harris as Cathy and Richard Burton as Heathcliff.
