His field of expertise was modern European history, his most notable work being A History of the Great War, 1914\u201318. He is mainly remembered, however, for the vendetta pursued against him by the novelist Evelyn Waugh, in which Waugh showed his distaste for his former tutor by repeatedly using the name \"Cruttwell\" in his early novels and stories to depict a sequence of unsavoury or ridiculous characters. The prolonged minor humiliation thus inflicted may have contributed to Cruttwell's eventual mental breakdown.\nCruttwell gained first-class honours at The Queen's College, Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, in 1911, and he became a lecturer in history at Hertford College the following year. His academic career was interrupted by war service, during which he suffered severe wounds; he returned to Oxford in 1919 and became dean of Hertford, and then principal of the college in 1930. It was during his tenure as dean that the feud with Evelyn Waugh developed while Waugh was a history scholar at Hertford in 1922\u20131924. Waugh pursued this hostility until shortly before Cruttwell's death.\nCruttwell's term as Hertford's principal saw the production of his most important scholarly works, including his war history which earned him the degree of DLitt. Beyond his college and academic duties Cruttwell held various administrative offices within the university, and was a member of its Hebdomadal Council, or ruling body. In private life Cruttwell served as a Justice of the Peace in Hampshire, where he had a country home, and stood unsuccessfully for the university's parliamentary seat in the 1935 general election, representing the Conservative Party. Ill-health, aggravated by his war injuries, caused his retirement from the Hertford principalship in 1939. A mental collapse led to his committal to an institution, where he died two years later.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Passchendaele", "response": ["Various casualty figures have been published for the Third Battle of Ypres, sometimes with acrimony; the highest estimates for British and German casualties appear to be discredited but the British claim to have taken  has not been disputed.

Acton and Howard rapidly became the centre of an avant-garde circle known as the Hypocrites' Club (Waugh was the secretary of the club), whose artistic, social and homosexual values Waugh adopted enthusiastically;Stannard, Vol. I pp. 83\u201385 he later wrote: \"It was the stamping ground of half my Oxford life\".Waugh, A Little Learning, pp. 179\u201381 He began drinking heavily, and embarked on the first of several homosexual relationships, the most lasting of which were with Hugh Lygon (the inspiration for the future  Lord Sebastian Flyte), Richard Pares and Alastair Graham.Stannard, Vol. I p. 90 He continued to write reviews and short stories for the university journals, and developed a reputation as a talented graphic artist, but formal study largely ceased. This neglect led to a bitter feud between Waugh and his history tutor, C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, dean (and later principal) of Hertford College. When Cruttwell advised him to mend his ways, Waugh responded in a manner which, he admitted later, was \"fatuously haughty\";Waugh, \"A Little Learning\", p. 175 from then on, relations between the two descended into mutual hatred.Stannard, Vol. I pp. 76\u201377 Waugh continued the feud long after his Oxford days by using Cruttwell's name in his early novels for a succession of ludicrous, ignominious or odious minor characters.Sykes, p. 45"]}, {"page": "Hertford College, Oxford", "response": ["In 1922, the novelist Evelyn Waugh came up to Hertford, famously feuding with his history tutor C.

Prior and Wilson traced the narrative through the writing of B. H. Liddell Hart, J. E. Edmonds the official historian, C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, Martin Middlebrook, Correlli Barnett and Paul Kennedy. In 1970, Anthony Farrar-Hockley questioned the narrative but reverted to the orthodox view soon after. Prior and Wilson did not dispute the facts of  and  but wrote that the Tactical Notes issued by Rawlinson did not dictate the way that advances were to be made but were \"ambiguous\", referring to \"celerity of movement\", \"a steady pace\" and \"a rapid advance of some lightly-equipped men\" and did not prescribe a formation to be adopted for the advance."]}, {"page": "Hew Strachan", "response": ["Strachan's early research and published work focussed on the history of the British Army, and he was awarded the Templer Medal for From Waterloo to Balaclava and the Westminster Medal for The Politics of the British Army.
