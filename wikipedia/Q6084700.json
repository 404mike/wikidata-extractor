He first represented Northamptonshire in the Second XI Championship in 1994, and between 1997 and 1999 appeared extensively in the competition, in the interim playing irregularly in first-class cricket matches.\nWhile with Glamorgan, Dawood showed that he was also a useful lower-order batsman and, in 1999, he recorded a maiden first-class hundred by making 102 against Gloucestershire at Cardiff, after being promoted to open the batting after injuries to other players. Later in the season, he also created a new county record by not conceding a bye as Lancashire totalled 556 for 6 declared at Blackpool.\nIn 39 first-class matches, Dawood scored 1,122 runs at 22 with a best of 102. He took 94 catches with six stumpings. In 51 one day matches he scored 732 runs at 21.52 with a top score of 60, taking 44 catches and making 14 stumpings.

Tendulkar was the first Asian player to represent Yorkshire, but he was an overseas player. It was not until 2003 that Dewsbury's Ismail Dawood became the first British-born Asian to play for Yorkshire. He was followed by Ajmal Shahzad and Adil Rashid who have both represented England. In 2007, Azeem Rafiq as a member of Yorkshire's academy team became the first player of an Asian background to captain England at any level when he was appointed U15s captain. In the summer of 2012, Rafiq stepped in for the injured Andrew Gale to captain the team in 6 T20 matches, becoming the first player of Asia origin to lead the county, as well as the youngest captain in the club's history."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["In a high-scoring match at The County Ground, Taunton, Matthew Wood and Ian Blackwell both cracked centuries as Somerset Sabres made their way to 345 for 4.
