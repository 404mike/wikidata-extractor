He developed rapidly, making his club debut within two years and earning the first of an eventual 14 caps for the Scottish national side four years later.\nCeltic manager Jimmy McGrory's attempts to rejuvenate his side eventually resulted in MacKay's departure from Celtic Park after over 200 first team appearances, the fullback moving to south Glasgow side Third Lanark in November 1964. Thirds were relegated at the end of the 1964\u201365 season and MacKay was one of several players released.\nMacKay opted to move to Australia at this juncture, joining Melbourne Croatia of the Victorian State League.  He helped the side to the State title in 1968 and several Dockerty Cup triumphs but left when Croatia were suspended following crowd disturbances in 1972. He returned to Scotland and joined junior club St Anthony's as a player-coach for two years before deciding upon a second stint in Australia. After playing for Perth Azzurri between 1974 and 1977 he coached with South Melbourne and Croatia (now known as Essendon Lions), the latter as Captain-Coach.\nMacKay died on 23 December 2019, aged 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Celtic F.C.", "response": ["| Duncan MacKay || 1961\u20131963"]}, {"page": "South Melbourne FC", "response": ["*  Duncan MacKay (1979)"]}, {"page": "Melbourne Knights FC", "response": ["* Duncan MacKay", "*1965: Duncan MacKay", "* Duncan MacKay"]}, {"page": "1937 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 14 July \u2013 Duncan MacKay, Scottish footballer (died 2019)"]}, {"page": "1962\u201363 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|RB |||| Duncan MacKay ", "|RB |||| Duncan MacKay "]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|RB |||| Duncan MacKay ", "|RB |||| Duncan MacKay "]}, {"page": "List of Celtic F.C. international footballers", "response": ["*Duncan MacKay (14)"]}, {"page": "1962 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 8", "response": ["| DF ||align=\"left\"| Duncan MacKay || 14 July 1937 || 1 || 0 || 90 || 0 || 0 || - || - || - ||bgcolor=red| 90 || - ||align=\"left\"|  Celtic F.C."]}, {"page": "History of Melbourne Knights FC", "response": ["With SC Croatia's return to the State League in 1965 the club would cement itself as one of the states most powerful sides under the guidance, for the most part, of long-time coach Mijo Kis. Between 1965 and 1972, SC Croatia finished in the top 4 five times and won 9 titles. In its three previous seasons in the State League the club had struggled and the 1965 season looked like this would continue with SC Croatia losing 6 of its first 9 matches of the season as relegation was being faced once more. The club president at the time Enver Begovi\u0107 reacted by spending over 5000 pounds to bring in players such as Scottish international Duncan MacKay, Brian Adlam, Hammy McMeechan (who was bought for a then Victorian record transfer fee of 1200 pounds from Slavia), Bill McLyntyre, Joe Keenan, Bobby McLachlan and Ian Currie. The club went to great lengths to bring in these players, sending Frank Burin to Scotland to sign the majority of the newcomers. These incredible signings saw the club dubbed the 'Glamour Team' of the State League. In the final 13 matches of the season the club won 10 of the matches and had the best record, picking up the most points, of any team in the State League over that period. They even defeated the top 3 sides, South Melbourne SC, Sunshine George Cross and Brunswick Juventus. Despite all this the club finished 6th as the damage at the start of the season was too much to overcome. Croatia also made the final of the Dockerty Cup for the first time, losing 1\u20130 to Slavia. They defeated their arch rivals Footscray JUST 2\u20131 in the semi-final.", "1977 saw the creation of the National Soccer League, four sides from Victoria entered the NSL. This exodus from the State League allowed the return of Essendon Croatia to the top flight of Victorian football after a 4-year absence. 1977 saw the club's favourite son, Billy Vojtek, return to Essendon Croatia to help them get back to the top. The club's first season back was marked by mixed results. The club started the season as one of the favourites after having won the pre-season Ampol Cup, it was the first and only time that a newly promoted side had lifted the trophy. But early season player losses to NSL clubs, Ivan Grui\u010di\u0107 to Canberra City FC and John Gardiner to South Melbourne SC (for $13,000), saw the club have a sluggish start to the State League winning only 2 of its first 12 matches. Club legend Duncan MacKay was brought in as coach, he introduced a number of new players including New Zealand international Brian Davidson and Steve Kokoska from Sunshine City. MacKay's influence had a deep impact with the club having a great second half of the season as Essendon Croatia won 6 of its final 10 matches, to finish a respectable seventh. The club also went on to make the Final of the Dockerty Cup, losing to Brunswick Juventus."]}, {"page": "Duncan MacKay", "response": ["Duncan MacKay or McKay may refer to:", "*Duncan MacKay (footballer) (1937\u20132019), Scottish former footballer"]}, {"page": "Maryhill Harp F.C.", "response": ["Hibs/Harp was generally run on a low cost basis and supplied players for wealthier Junior clubs and Senior teams.
