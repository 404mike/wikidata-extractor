He turned professional in 1979 and played on the European Tour through most of the 1980s and 1990s. He finished in the top one hundred of the Order of Merit ten times, with a best of 33rd place in 1994, the year he won his only European Tour title, the Jersey European Airways Open.\nHaving lost his place on the European Tour, Curry moved to the United States and won a PGA Tour card at the 1999 qualifying school. During his rookie season in 2000, he made only seven cuts in twenty five outings to lose his playing status on the tour. He made several return trips to the qualifying tournament without success.\nCurry played several events on the second tier Nationwide Tour in 2001, and latterly has competed on the third tier NGA Hooters Tour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "East Bergholt", "response": ["*Paul Curry (born 1961), professional  golfer."]}, {"page": "Paul Curry", "response": ["Paul Curry (August 19, 1917\u2013February 19, 1986) was the vice-president of the Blue Cross Insurance Company of New York, and a famous amateur magician who became well known in the magic community for inventing highly-original card magic.Paul Curry Magicpedia", "On 12 March 1977, the Academy of Magical Arts at The Magic Castle awarded Paul Curry a \"Creative Fellowship\" award.", "*Paul Curry's Worlds Beyond (2002) "]}, {"page": "AGF Open", "response": ["| 1990 ||  Brett Ogle || align=center|278 || align=center|\u221210 || 3 strokes ||  Paul Curry Bill Longmuir || La Grande Motte || "]}, {"page": "Jersey Open", "response": ["| 1994 ||  Paul Curry || align=center|266 || align=center|\u221222 || 3 strokes ||  Mark James"]}, {"page": "Brett Ogle", "response": ["| Paul Curry,  Bill Longmuir"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Paul Curry||1961\u2013"]}, {"page": "1994 European Tour", "response": ["| Paul Curry (1)"]}, {"page": "1999 PGA Tour Qualifying School graduates", "response": ["| T30|| Paul Curry || 1 || 0 || 1 European Tour win", "|align=left| Paul Curry*|| 25 || 7 ||  || 183 || 128,701"]}, {"page": "Paul Currie", "response": ["* Paul Curry (1917\u20131986), businessman and amateur magician", "* Paul Curry (golfer) (born 1961), English golfer"]}, {"page": "1996 Volvo PGA Championship", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\" align=center|T2||Paul Curry||||rowspan=\"2\" align=center|68||rowspan=\"2\" align=center|\u22124", "|Paul Curry||||align=center|68-71=139", "|rowspan=\"3\" align=center|T4||Paul Curry||||align=center|68-71-69=208||rowspan=\"3\" align=center|\u22128"]}]}}
