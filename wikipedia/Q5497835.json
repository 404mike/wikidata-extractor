He first came to prominence when he defended Dr John Bodkin Adams in 1957 on a charge of the murder of Mrs  Edith Alice Morrell, the first murder case he handled. Prejudicial press coverage of the case prior to the trial suggested Adams was guilty and that the verdict would be a foregone conclusion, but Lawrence successfully secured an acquittal. Adams, if convicted, night have been hanged, had he also been found guilty on a second murder indictment that had been brought. Devlin at the time and later investigation suggested Adams was acquitted in part due to inadequate prosecution preparations and also due to the lack of strong and credible evidence.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoffrey Lawrence", "response": ["* Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence (1902\u20131967), British lawyer and jurist"]}, {"page": "John Bodkin Adams", "response": ["The leading Defence counsel Sir Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence, QC, had been briefed by the Medical Defence Union with the additional task of obtaining a ruling on whether medical treatments that might shorten the life of a terminally ill patient were legal.Furneaux, pp. 72\u20133. Lawrence, a \"specialist in real estate and divorce cases [and] a relative stranger in criminal court\", who was defending his first murder trial, convinced the jury that there was no evidence that a murder had been committed, much less that a murder had been committed by Adams. He emphasised that the indictment was based mainly on testimonies from the nurses who tended Mrs Morrell, and that there were discrepancies between the evidence given by different witnesses. Then, on the second day of the trial, he produced notebooks written by the nurses, detailing Adams' treatment of Morrell. The prosecution claimed not to have seen these notebooks: these differed from the nurses' recollection of events, and showed that smaller quantities of drugs were given to the patient than the prosecution had thought, based on Adams' prescriptions."]}, {"page": "Oxford Bach Choir", "response": ["*Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence QC \u2013 lawyer who successfully defended suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams in 1957."]}, {"page": "Death of Edith Alice Morrell", "response": ["The leading Defence counsel Sir Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence, QC asked for a list of all prescriptions for the whole period in which Adams had cared for Mrs Morrell, not just of the dangerous drugs for ten and a half months in 1950 presented by the prosecution. The earlier list showed Adams had prescribed a total of 1,629\u00bd\u00a0grains of barbiturates; 1,928\u00a0grains of Sedormid; 16411\u204412\u00a0grains of morphia and 139\u00bd\u00a0grains of heroin.Cullen, p. 285 Lawrence was able to use the complete list, together with the results of his cross examination of the nurses and the prosecution expert witnesses and examination-in-chief of the defence medical expert to describe the decline of an old lady during which Adams had made her comfortable to the best of his ability although using substantial (but not necessarily lethal) amounts of opiate drugs, until her decline accelerated towards a natural death from old age, possibly related to a second stroke.Devlin, pp. 81\u20133, 114\u20137, 137, 149.

He admitted later in that cross-examination that his evidence at the committal hearing was given without knowledge of Mrs Morrell's treatment in the first 18 months after her  stroke, only that in the last 10 months before her death, and was based the assumption, later shown to incorrect, that she had been in a coma for the last three or four days of her life.British Medical Journal, The. Trial Of Dr. J. Bodkin Adams: Expert Evidence., London, No 5012, 1957. Leading defence counsel, Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence also secured an admission from Dr Douthwaite that, in his examination-in-chief, his evidence on possible withdrawal symptoms was in response to instances selected by the Attorney-General that might not have been representative. When questioned as to whether this procedure was fair or not, Douthwaite argued that it was up to the defence to question him on that point and not his duty to comment on fairness. Douthwaite also accepted that it was be essential to his theory of an intentional killing that Adams knew that opiates would accumulate in the body of an elderly immobile patient.", "The historian Pamela Cullen defended Douthwaite, basing her defence on the hypothesis that Manningham-Buller had intentionally given up possession of vital evidence, the nurses' notebooks, which detailed Adams' treatment of the patient, adding that he actually gave them to the defence, which allowed defence counsel Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence QC to present them on the second day of the trial. Douthwaite, she claimed, was therefore not able to examine these notebooks to prepare his evidence. However, copies of the notebooks were provided to the prosecution on the second day of the trial, and Douthwaite did not start to give his evidence until the seventh day, with a weekend intervening before he finished his evidence on the tenth day. Devlin, on the contrary, criticised the police for overlooking the nurses' notebooks: there is apparently no record that the notebooks were seized by the police, and no evidence that Manningham-Buller ever had possession of them. In any event, Douthwaite's new hypothesis did not relate to the qualities of opiates administered, so much as moving the date on which he considered the planning and execution of the act of murder began, from 7 November 1950 back to 1 November 1950.
