Ashens heavily criticises its gameplay and graphics, expressing that the combat \"feels futile\" and stating that \"on starting the game, the first thing to hit you is how incredibly ugly the characters are ... Astoundingly, it plays even worse than it looks. None of the sword fighting moves seem to do much ... you can't really tell who is successfully hitting whom ...

Ashens calls Highlander's controls \"horribly unresponsive\" and moving the player character \"clumsy\", saying the single tactic to winning Highlander is to \"mash the fire button and hope\".
