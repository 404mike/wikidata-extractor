He had many friends among the piping community, men who admired his approach to \"their\" tunes. Of contemporary pipers he particularly admired G. S. McLennan, Angus Mackay and William Lawrie. Yet to him the strathspey was the soul of Scots fiddling. He never played for dancing, and his approach to these tunes, which was personal, led him to use whichever tempo he felt suited to a particular melody. A favourite strathspey was \"Craigellachie Bridge\" by William Marshall (1748\u20131833), and indeed he also liked Marshall's inventive reels and, perhaps, the technical challenge that some of Marshall's music offered \u2013 once, when asked why he wrote music that was so difficult to play, Marshall answered (uncompromisingly) that he \"did not write for bunglers\"; MacAndrew enjoyed and admired this challenging music, and of all fiddle composers, it was Marshall he regarded most highly (though he also had a soft spot for Peter Milne). MacAndrew was himself a considerable composer of fiddle tunes, and a book of his tunes, 97 of them, The MacAndrew Collection, was published in 2002. His air, \"Gight Castle\", is particularly haunting. He was, however, dismissive of his efforts in this field, too much so friends, colleagues and pupils believed, and his aim, he said, was never for publication; but there is no doubt that the eventual book added a valuable addition to the library available to Scots fiddlers."]}, {"page": "Willie Lawrie", "response": ["#redirect William Lawrie"]}, {"page": "Willie Laurie", "response": ["#redirect William Lawrie"]}, {"page": "William Laurie", "response": ["#redirect William Lawrie"]}, {"page": "Lawrie, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Lawrie"]}, {"page": "G.
