He made 78 league appearances over the next three years, scoring six goals, before moving to Northampton Town. After 88 league appearances in two years he wrote to Plymouth Argyle manager Johnny Hore to ask for a trial. He would spend the next ten years at Home Park, but he lost his place in the team after the arrival of Dave Smith as the club's manager. He spent time on loan with Southend United in 1987, making six appearances, but he turned down a permanent transfer because he was settled in Plymouth. He regained his place in the Argyle team and remained an important member of the squad for the next six years. His final appearance for the club came in May 1994 when the club took part in the Second Division play-offs. He was sent off in the second leg against Burnley and returned to the dressing room, where he broke down in tears. He finished his career in non-league football and became a driving instructor after retiring.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Saltash United F.C.", "response": ["* Adrian Burrows"]}, {"page": "Burrows (surname)", "response": ["* Adrian Burrows (b. 1959), former English footballer"]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Adrian Burrows"]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Adrian Burrows"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Adrian Burrows"]}]}}
