He and his wife Bridget had one son, Paul. He was elected as a Republican Labour Party member of the Senate of Northern Ireland in 1969. The following year, he became a founder member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and its first General Secretary. He was also a Belfast City Councillor.\nOn 26 June 1973, Wilson (aged 39) and his companion, Irene Andrews (aged 29), a Protestant, were found dead. They had been stabbed to death. Wilson's throat was cut. He was interred in Belfast's Milltown Cemetery. Loyalist John White was later convicted for his part in the murders.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ulster Defence Association", "response": ["The UDA/UFF were responsible for more than 400 deaths.

High-profile attacks carried out by the group include the Top of the Hill bar shooting, the Milltown massacre, the Sean Graham's and James Murray's bookmakers' shootings, the Castlerock killings, killings of Paddy Wilson and Irene Andrews and the Greysteel massacre. Most of its attacks were in Northern Ireland, but from 1972 onward it also carried out bombings in the Republic of Ireland. The UDA/UFF declared a ceasefire in 1994 and ended its campaign in 2007, but some of its members have continued to engage in violence. The other main Loyalist paramilitary group during the conflict was the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). All three groups are Proscribed Organisations in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000. They are designated as an international terrorist organisation in the United States.", "At its peak of strength it held around forty thousand members, mostly part-time. During this period of legality, the UDA committed a large number of attacks using the name Ulster Freedom Fighters, including the murder of Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) politician Paddy Wilson and his companion Irene Andrews in 1973. The UDA was involved in the successful Ulster Workers Council Strike in 1974, which brought down the Sunningdale Agreement: a power-sharing agreement for Northern Ireland, which some unionists thought conceded too much to nationalist demands. The UDA enforced this general strike through widespread intimidation across Northern Ireland. The strike was led by VUPP Assemblyman and UDA member, Glenn Barr."]}, {"page": "Patrick Wilson", "response": ["*Paddy Wilson (1933\u20131973), Northern Irish politician", "*Paddy Wilson (footballer) (born 1946), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Republican Labour Party", "response": ["In August 1970, Fitt founded the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and he and Senator Paddy Wilson were expelled from the RLP by a vote of 52 to 1.Michael A.
