The first Fashion release hit number 1 in the UK reggae charts in the summer of 1980 - Dee Sharp's \"Let's Dub It Up\". In the next few years many British reggae artists, and artists who were passing through from Jamaica, turned up on the label: Keith Douglas, Carlton Manning (of Carlton & His Shoes), Alton Ellis, Carlton Lewis and Johnnie Clarke amongst others."]}]}}
