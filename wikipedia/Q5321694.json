Stamp in 1930).Sanders, Norman (ed.). Othello (2003, rev. ed.), New Cambridge Shakespeare, p1. Based on its style, the play is usually dated 1603 or 1604, but arguments have been made for dates as early as 1601 or 1602.E. A. J. Honigmann (ed), Othello (1997), Arden Shakespeare, Appendix 1, pp. 344\u2013350.", "There is no consensus over Othello's ethnic origin. In Elizabethan discourse, the word \"black\" could suggest various concepts that extended beyond the physical colour of skin, including a wide range of negative connotations.Doris Adler, \"The Rhetoric of Black and White in Othello\" Shakespeare Quarterly, 25 (1974)Oxford English Dictionary, 'Black', 1c. E. A. J. Honigmann, the editor of an Arden Shakespeare edition, concluded that Othello's race is ambiguous. \"Renaissance representations of the Moor were vague, varied, inconsistent, and contradictory. As critics have established, the term 'Moor' referred to dark-skinned people in general, used interchangeably with terms such as 'African', 'Somali', 'Ethiopian', 'Negro', 'Arab', 'Berber', and even 'Indian' to designate a figure from Africa (or beyond).\"Making More of the Moor: Aaron, Othello, and Renaissance Refashionings of Race. Emily C. Bartels\"Moor, n2\", The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edtn. Various uses of the word black (for example, \"Haply for I am black\") are insufficient evidence for any accurate racial classification, Honigmann argues, since black could simply mean swarthy to Elizabethans.", "Othello is referred to as a \"Barbary horse\" (1.1.113) and a \"lascivious Moor\" (1.1.127). In 3.3 he denounces Desdemona's supposed sin as being \"black as mine own face\". Desdemona's physical whiteness is otherwise presented in opposition to Othello's dark skin: 5.2 \"that whiter skin of hers than snow\". Iago tells Brabantio that \"an old black ram / is tupping your white ewe\" (1.1.88). When Iago uses the word Barbary or Barbarian to refer to Othello, he seemingly refers to the Barbary coast inhabited by Berbers. Roderigo calls Othello \"the thicklips\", which seems to refer to Sub-Saharan African physiognomy, but Honigmann counters that, as these comments are all intended as insults by the characters, they need not be taken literally.E. A. J. Honigmann, ed. Othello. London: Thomas Nelson, 1997, p. 15."]}, {"page": "King John (play)", "response": ["King John is closely related to an anonymous history play, The Troublesome Reign of King John (c. 1589), the \"masterly construction\" the infelicitous expression of which led Peter Alexander to argue that Shakespeare's was the earlier play. E. A. J. Honigmann elaborated these arguments, both in his preface to the second Arden edition of King John, and in his 1982 monograph on Shakespeare's influence on his contemporaries. The majority view, however, first advanced in a rebuttal of Honigmann's views by Kenneth Muir, holds that the Troublesome Reign antedates King John by a period of several years; and that the skilful plotting of the Troublesome Reign is neither unparalleled in the period, nor proof of Shakespeare's involvement."]}, {"page": "Chronology of Shakespeare's plays", "response": ["In addition, some scholars dissent from the conventional dating system altogether. A notable scholar who does so is E. A. J. Honigmann, who has attempted to push back the beginning of Shakespeare's career by four or five years, to the mid-1580s, with his \"early start\" theory. Honigmann argues that Shakespeare began his career with Titus Andronicus in 1586, though the conventional dating is that Shakespeare began writing plays after arriving in London in about 1590. Most scholars, however, adhere to a more orthodox chronology, and some, such as Gary Taylor and Sidney Thomas, argue that the early start theory causes more problems than it solves.

He was 21 when he received the commission. The engraving is probably based on a pre-existing painting or drawing. Since Martin's uncle of the same name was an established painter, it was suggested by E. A. J. Honigmann that the elder Martin may have made the original image, which could explain why his young relation was given the commission for the engraving. Tarnya Cooper argues that the poor drawing and modelling of the doublet and collar suggests that Droeshout was copying a lost drawing or painting that only depicted Shakespeare's head and shoulders. The body was added by the engraver himself, as was common practice."]}, {"page": "Foul papers", "response": ["The term \"foul papers\" is given different definitions by various scholars.

His long and extremely obscure allegory about a phoenix and turtledove has led to several conflicting interpretations.

Chester's poem contains a series of \"Cantos\" at the end of the allegory.
