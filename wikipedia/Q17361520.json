He derived that reputation not from the writing of popular histories or media appearances but from his abilities as a linguist, economic historian, archival researcher, historical narrator and political scientist. He made an essential contribution to the understanding of modern European history and integration: the elements that went to shape contemporary Europe.Although he is usually seen as an economic historian, he worked in many other fields, including economic theory and policy, economic and political history, contemporary economic and political studies. He was a very rigorous modern political economist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Highgate Cemetery", "response": ["* Alan Milward, influential historian"]}, {"page": "Edward Luttwak", "response": ["The idea of a grand strategy in geopolitics and national security gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s. The 1969 book The Politics of Grand Strategy: Britain and France Prepare for War, 1904-1914 by the US historian Samuel R. Williamson Jr. first applied the grand strategy concept to Anglo-French war planning prior to World War I. In the 1973 book Grand Strategy; Principles and Practices John M Collins lectured the reader on how a military grand strategy is relevant to the US in the post-World War II era. In 1979 Luttwak followed with his book The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire from the First Century AD to the Third. The controversy that followed Luttwak's book increased the wider interest in grand strategy. The academics Barry Posen and Paul Kennedy subsequently interpreted grand strategy for the time after the lost Vietnam War. The economic historian Alan Milward started to detect a strategic synthesis that could explain all factors that needed to be taken into account, that being political, military, social and psychological."]}, {"page": "Ben Kerkvliet", "response": ["* \"Withdrawal and Resistance: the Political Significance of Food, Agriculture, and How People Lived During the Japanese Occupation in the Philippines,\" in Laurie Sears, ed., Autonomous Histories, Particular Truths: Essays in Honor of John Smail.
