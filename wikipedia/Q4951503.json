He was born at Frome, Somerset and died at Keyford, which is part of Frome.\nCase was a right-handed middle-order batsman whose batting technique, in one account, was \"limited and effective\". He also kept wicket very occasionally in the period at the end of the 1920s and into the 1930s when regular Somerset wicket-keeper Wally Luckes was ill. Although the Somerset side in Case's time often contained amateur players who appeared in relatively few matches, Case was virtually a regular, appearing in 255 matches for the county in 11 seasons, plus two for the Gentlemen in Gentlemen v Players games in 1931 and 1934.", "link_mentions": {}}}
