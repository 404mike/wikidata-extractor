When Jenyns decided not to leave his parish, he and Henslow thought of Darwin.

Though Jenyns nearly accepted and even packed his clothes, he had concerns about his obligations as vicar of Swaffham Bulbeck and about his health, therefore Jenyns declined the offer. Henslow briefly thought of going, but his wife \"looked so miserable\" that he quickly dropped the idea. Both recommended bringing the 22-year-old Charles Darwin, who was on a geology field trip with Adam Sedgwick. He had just completed the ordinary Bachelor of Arts degree which was a prerequisite for his intended career as a parson.", "The letter went first to George Peacock, who quickly forwarded it to Darwin with further details, confirming that the \"ship sails about the end of September\". Peacock had discussed the offer with Beaufort, \"he entirely approves of it & you may consider the situation as at your absolute disposal\". When Darwin returned home late on 29 August and opened the letters, his father objected strongly to the voyage so, the next day, he wrote declining the offer and left to go shooting at the estate of his uncle Josiah Wedgwood II. With Wedgwood's help, Darwin's father was persuaded to relent and fund his son's expedition, and on Thursday 1 September, Darwin wrote accepting Peacock's offer. That day, Beaufort wrote to tell FitzRoy that his friend Peacock had \"succeeded in getting a 'Savant' for you\u2014A Mr Darwin grandson of the well known philosopher and poet\u2014full of zeal and enterprize and having contemplated a voyage on his own account to S. America\".

At the outset, George Peacock had advised that \"The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish you with an official appointment & every : if a salary should be required however I am inclined to think that it would be granted\". Far from wanting this, Darwin's concern was to maintain control over his collection. He was even reluctant to be on the Admiralty's books for victuals until he got assurances from FitzRoy and Beaufort that this would not affect his rights to assign his specimens. Darwin did not want his collection to go to the British Museum as he had heard that specimens from the first Beagle voyage were still waiting to be described. Beaufort assured him that he \"should have no difficulty\" as long as he \"presented them to some public body\" such as the Zoological or Geological societies. Darwin himself thought his new finds should go to the \"largest & most central collection\", not the Cambridge Philosophical Society museum that Henslow was setting up at Cambridge. Contrarily, after getting Henslow's willing agreement to take delivery of the consignments of specimens, Darwin replied that he hoped to give some to the Cambridge museum."]}, {"page": "Rede Lecture", "response": ["*1819 George Peacock (Philosophy)"]}]}}
