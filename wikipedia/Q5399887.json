Born to a family with a long history of dealing in Persian Carpets dating nine generations back to 1766, he gained much of his knowledge from his father Benayahoo Sakhai. Essie is the founder of Essie Carpets, based in Mayfair London, and holds one of the world's most comprehensive and finest collections of Persian and Oriental carpets and rugs in private hands. Various pieces of Essie's collection have featured in numerous museums and exhibitions around the world; including the 'Fabric of Life' exhibition of the Sakhai Family Collection opened by HRH Prince Charles.\nCarrying on the family tradition started in 1766, he spends most of his time at his galleries situated in London's Mayfair overlooking St James' Palace and Buckingham Palace. In recent years, Essie Carpets has collaborated with renowned global brands including Disney, Gucci, Paul Smith and London and Paris Fashion Week.\nEssie is the author of three books in which he shares his extensive knowledge on the subject of Persian and Oriental carpets; The Story of Carpets (1991), Oriental Carpets: A Buyer's Guide (1995), and Persian Rugs and Carpets: The Fabric of Life (2007).Essie was an advisor for the first work of academic research on Persian rugs as an alternative investment, through the Faculty of Finance of Cass Business School of City, University of London. The study by Professor A. Clare examined price appreciation of the art form, compared to UK government bonds and UK equities (FTSE-100). Results from the construction of an index of Persian rug prices illustrated that an investment in a diversified holding of Persian rugs represents an attractive diversifying option, particularly for long-term institutional investors seeking non-financial assets (such as university endowments, insurance companies, pension funds or family offices). \u201cA carpet from Essie makes a room and gives soul to a house. It is not merely an object of great beauty but an investment that can give you enormous pleasure on a daily basis.\u201d The Financial Times\nEssie advises museums, royal families, institutions and private collectors on Persian carpets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Persian Jews", "response": ["* Essie Sakhai - art dealer, businessman "]}, {"page": "Essie", "response": ["* Essie Sakhai, Iranian-born British expert on Persian carpets and oriental rugs"]}]}}
