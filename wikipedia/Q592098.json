Despite a good start to their campaign, the club fell into the relegation zone in the new year. Adams was clearly resentful of lucrative long-term contracts dealt out to his less talented players by previous managers, which restricted his ability to bring in fresh faces to boost their campaign. Leicester slipped back down again in 2003\u201304 to 18th place, bracketed together with the two other relegated sides \u2014 Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers \u2014 whose goal difference was inferior to Leicester's. The \"Foxes\" were becoming a \"yo-yo club\" and Adams blamed this on a lack of investment. During March 2004 nine Leicester players were arrested for various offences related to a drunken outing that ended with an alleged sexual assault on three German tourists, with three players being charged: Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie. The three faced up to fourteen years in prison if found guilty of rape, and the trio's bail totalled \u00a3196,500. The club had already been rocked by various incidents on overseas tours over years, with Stan Collymore arrested for setting off a fire extinguisher in 2000, and Dennis Wise breaking Callum Davidson's jaw in a row over a card game in 2002. Adams had previously initiated a crackdown in club discipline, going so far as to enforce random breathalyser tests. Adams said that \"in a lot of people's eyes, the players are guilty before they have had a fair trial \u2013 which is not the case\". The incident also cast doubt over Adams' future at the club, as reports surfaced that he planned to quit the club. He did in fact offer his resignation, which was rejected by the club. However, he kept faith in his players' innocence, and claimed \"if they are guilty of anything it is of being unprofessional \u2013 of being drunk to excess\". His faith was later vindicated when it transpired that all allegations against the players were false."]}]}}
