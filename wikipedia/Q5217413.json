A category-C listed building, it is situated in the Highland council area, east of the village of Plockton on the south shore of Loch Carron. It was built in 1866 in the Scottish baronial style, to designs by Alexander Ross, for Scottish Member of Parliament and businessman Alexander Matheson. The castle remained in the Matheson family until the 1920s, when it was sold to Sir Daniel Hamilton and his wife Margaret, who owned the neighbouring estate. The Hamiltons intended to use the castle for educational purposes in the local community, but this never came to fruition and following the outbreak of World War II, the castle was used as a naval hospital. By the end of the war, Daniel Hamilton had died, and Margaret bequeathed the castle to the local council, which converted it for use as a home economics college for girls, operating in this capacity until its closure in 1989.", "By the 1920s the Matheson family were in financial difficulty and they sold the castle to Sir Daniel Hamilton and his wife Lady Margaret Hamilton, owners of the neighbouring Balmacara Estate. The Hamiltons, supporters of social reform, planned to use the castle as a community education centre for local people to receive training in activities such as weaving. In 1938 the local authority began discussions with the Hamiltons about using the castle for education purposes, but these did not come to fruition before the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Sir Daniel Hamilton died during the early stages of the war, and the castle was used during the hostilities by the government, as a naval hospital."]}, {"page": "Sundarbans settlements", "response": ["In December 1932, Rabindranath Tagore visited and stayed at Gosaba in the house of Sir Daniel Hamilton."]}]}}
