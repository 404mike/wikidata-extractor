He was mentally disabled and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived on the streets and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like excess whisky\u2014he preferred snuff\u2014he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. When the body was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection."]}, {"page": "Alanna", "response": ["* Alanna Knight (1923\u20132020), British writer"]}, {"page": "1923 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Alanna Knight, writer (died 2020)"]}, {"page": "Lin Anderson", "response": ["Lin is a member of the Femmes Fatales crime writing trio, together with Alanna Knight and Alex Gray."]}, {"page": "Knight (surname)", "response": ["* Alanna Knight (1923\u20132020), British writer"]}, {"page": "Alex Gray (author)", "response": ["Alex Gray (pen name: n\u00e9e Sandra Lang) was brought up in the Craigbank area of Glasgow and attended Hutchesons' Grammar School.
