In 1888 Griffiths was part of the Llanelli squad who faced the first touring Southern Hemisphere rugby team, the New Zealand Natives. Griffiths was constant in rushes against the Maoris,Billot (1972), pg 18. and the game was decided by a single long range dropped goal from Llanelli's Harry Bowen. Griffiths was later selected for the Welsh national team, partnered with Newport's Charlie Thomas, in a match against Ireland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. The Welsh team on that day included four Llanelli players, Griffith's team-mates being Tom Morgan, Dan Griffiths and Ned Roberts, all four playing their final international match. The game was played at St. Helen's and the Wales team was captained for the first time by rugby superstar Arthur 'Monkey' Gould. Wales lost the game by two tries to nil and in the next game Griffiths was replaced by William Stadden, and never represented his country again."]}, {"page": "Tom Morgan (rugby union)", "response": ["Morgan was one of a small group of players from Llanelli Rugby Club, who gained international caps in the late 1880s, but played little more than a handful of games. Morgan played just a single game for his country, a home match at St. Helen's in Swansea, against Ireland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Among the Welsh team on that day were four Llanelli players, though none had been selected for the opening game of the tournament against Scotland. Morgan's club team-mates for that match included Giotto Griffiths, Ned Roberts and Dan Griffiths. This would be the last international game for all four players. Ireland won the game by two tries to nil, both of the scores coming from Irish debuts. Morgan lost his place in the Welsh squad the next season to Penarth's Dickie Garrett, and didn't play for Wales again."]}, {"page": "Dan Griffiths (rugby union, born 1857)", "response": ["Griffiths lost his place for the next international, the opener of the 1889 Home Nations Championship to Scotland, but was back in the team for the second and final game of the tournament at home to Ireland. Four Llanelli players were brought into the team, Griffiths, Giotto Griffiths, Ned Roberts and Tom Morgan, which would later turn out to be all four's final international. Wales were led by Arthur Gould, who with nine caps was the most experienced player in both teams;Godwin (1984), pg 22. but could not find the play to beat a useful Irish team.Griffiths (1987), pg 4:4. The Irish won by two tries to nil and Griffiths ended his international career with a loss."]}, {"page": "Samuel Clark (rugby union)", "response": ["Although slighted at being replaced from his duties, Clark was soon on good terms with the WRU, and on 28 January 1882 he was chosen to represent Wales in their second international game. The game was played away from home at Lansdowne Road, and was the first ever meeting between the Welsh and Irish rugby teams. Clark was paired at full-back with Charles Lewis, and although an acrimonious match,Griffiths (1987), pg 4:3. Wales won by two goals to nil. Clark would need to wait over five years for his second and final international cap, again played against Ireland. The match was the final game of the 1887 Home Nations Championship, with Clark brought in to replace Cardiff's Hugh 'Sawdust' Hughes. The Welsh full-back position was in a phase of transition, and Clark was one of five different players would take up the role in the eight games leading up to Billy Bancroft taking the position long-term. Although Wales were victorious over Ireland, Clark was himself replaced for the next season by Ned Roberts."]}, {"page": "Hugh Hughes (rugby union)", "response": ["Hughes was reselected for Wales in the 1889 Championship, again for the away match to Scotland. Wales lost this game, but by a far smaller margin than the 1887 encounter. The next match of the tournament saw Hughes replaced by Ned Roberts."]}]}}
