He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series.\nBrown was credited with 89 wickets in his career (i.e., bowled only) with a best return of six in one innings.  He had a reputation for extreme pace and was widely known as \"Brown of Brighton\".  He is said, though the story may be apocryphal, to have once killed a dog when a ball he had bowled went past the stumps and through a coat held by the longstop, hitting the dog which was behind the coat.  Another of his longstops, a man called Dench, insisted on fielding with a sack of straw tied to his chest for protection. E H Budd played against both Brown and Walter Marcon, who had a similar reputation, and Budd said that \"Brown was not more terrific in his speed than Marcon\", an elaborate way of saying that they were both extremely fast. Brown was a useful batsman and made 1053 runs at 11.44 with a top score of 70 which he scored during the first of the three roundarm trial matches. He died in Winchester, Hampshire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
