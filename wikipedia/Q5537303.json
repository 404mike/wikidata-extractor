He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series.\nBrown was credited with 89 wickets in his career (i.e., bowled only) with a best return of six in one innings.  He had a reputation for extreme pace and was widely known as \"Brown of Brighton\".  He is said, though the story may be apocryphal, to have once killed a dog when a ball he had bowled went past the stumps and through a coat held by the longstop, hitting the dog which was behind the coat.  Another of his longstops, a man called Dench, insisted on fielding with a sack of straw tied to his chest for protection. E H Budd played against both Brown and Walter Marcon, who had a similar reputation, and Budd said that \"Brown was not more terrific in his speed than Marcon\", an elaborate way of saying that they were both extremely fast. Brown was a useful batsman and made 1053 runs at 11.44 with a top score of 70 which he scored during the first of the three roundarm trial matches. He died in Winchester, Hampshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Brown", "response": ["George Brown may refer to:", "* George Brown, Baron George-Brown (1914\u20131985), British politician, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "* George Brown Jr. (1920\u20131999), U.S. Representative from California, 1963\u20131971; 1973\u20131999", "* George Brown (Australian politician) (1929\u20132002), Australian politician and Lord Mayor from Darwin, Northern Territory", "* George Brown (Canadian politician) (1818\u20131880), Scottish-born Canadian journalist, politician", "* George Brown (lieutenant governor) (1746\u20131836), American lieutenant governor of Rhode Island", "* George Brown (South African politician) (1870\u20131932), Scottish-born South African trade unionist and politician", "* George Brown (Wisconsin politician) (1830\u20131909), English-born Wisconsin politician", "* George Brown (communist) (1906\u20131937), Irish born Manchester communist who was killed in the Spanish Civil War", "* George Brown (Ottawa politician) (born 1959), Canadian", "* George Brown (footballer, born 1880), English footballer, Stoke,\tNorwich City, Millwall, Sheffield United", "* George Brown (footballer, born 1883), English footballer, Southampton ", "* George Brown (footballer, born 1903) (\u201348), English footballer, Huddersfield, Aston Villa, Burnley, Leeds United", "* George Brown (footballer, born 1907) (\u201388), Scottish international footballer, Rangers\t", "* George Brown (footballer, born 1928) (\u20132011), Scottish footballer, Stenhousemuir, Hamilton Academical", "* George Brown (soccer, born 1935), American soccer player, New York Americans, Elizabeth Falcons", "* George Brown (Australian soccer), Australian international soccer player, Brisbane City, Pineapple Rovers", "* George Brown (athlete) (1931\u20132018), American long jumper", "* George Brown (1910s outfielder) (1885\u2013?), Negro leagues baseball outfielder", "* George Brown (basketball) (born 1935), American basketball player", "* George Brown (coach), American football coach", "* George Brown (cricketer, born 1783) (1783\u20131857), English professional cricketer", "* George Brown (cricketer, born 1821) (1821\u20131875), English cricketer", "* George Brown (cricketer, born 1887) (1887\u20131964), English cricketer", "* George Brown (American football) (1923\u20132008), American football player", "* George Brown (gridiron football) (1923\u20132013), American and Canadian football player", "* George Brown (Australian footballer) (born 1959), Australian rules footballer", "* George Brown (ice hockey) (1912\u20131972), Canadian ice hockey centre", "* George Brown (motorcyclist) (1912\u20131979)", "* George Brown (rower) (1839\u20131875), champion single scull", "* George Brown (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1940s, for England, and Batley", "* George Brown (rugby league, Castleford), rugby league footballer of the 1950s and 1960s, for Castleford", "* George Brown (sailor), British Olympic sailor", "* George Brown (1940s outfielder), Negro league baseball player", "* George Brown (pitcher), Negro league baseball player", "* George Brown (musician) (born 1949), drummer for Kool & the Gang", "* George Brown (scholar), scholar of Anglo-Saxon literature", "* George Brown (inventor) (1650\u20131730), Scottish inventor", "* George Brown (financier) (1787\u20131859), American banker and railroad founder", "* George Brown (bishop of Dunkeld) (c. 1438\u20131515), Scottish churchman", "* George Brown (Benedictine) (died 1628), English Benedictine", "* George Brown (bishop of Liverpool) (1784\u20131856), English Roman Catholic Bishop of Liverpool, 1850\u20131856", "* George Brown (missionary) (1835\u20131917), English missionary to Fiji, Samoa, and New Britain; and president-general of the Methodist Church of Australasia 1913\u20131916", "* George Brown (admiral) (1835\u20131913), American admiral", "* George Brown (British Army officer) (1790\u20131865), British soldier in the Peninsular War and the Crimean War", "* George Brown (executioner), English executioner, 1911\u20131919", "* George Brown (judge) (1942\u20132007), Chief Justice of Belize from 1990 to 1998", "* George Brown (union official), president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes c.1940", "* Igor Gouzenko (1919\u20131982), Soviet defector given the alias George Brown by the Government of Canada", "* George Brown (Governor of Bombay), British Governor of Bombay, 1811\u20131812", "* George Brown (sociologist) (born 1930), medical sociologist", "* George Brown College, applied arts and technology college in Toronto, Ontario, Canada", "* George Brown, Class Clown, a book series by author Nancy E.

The second match was a Gentlemen v Players match which was heavily interrupted by rain, meaning only 85 runs were scored on the opening day's play.  In 1846, a match took place between the Zingari Club and the officers of the 12th Lancers regiment, which included Thomas Box, John Wisden and James Hodson.
