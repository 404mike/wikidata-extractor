Although her birthdate is generally given as 1820, this may have been a useful fiction, as baptism records give the 1811 date.She was highly intelligent and received a good education. She could converse in French and Italian, as well as being well-versed in Latin; she played pianoforte and harp.  In 1836, at West Hackney (perhaps on York Road near modern Dalston?), she married Charles James Carleton, a medical student working at Guy's Hospital and who could claim a family connection with the Earls of Dorchester. Together with their two young children (James Poole Carleton born 23 April 1839 and one other) they left for Australia in 1839, on the Prince Regent. It was a rough passage and both children died and were buried at sea.

The second phase was a contest to compose the melody for the song, and lodge it with the judges within little more than a week. It was stipulated that entrants were not to identify themselves. Of the twenty-three entries, Herr Linger's tune (submitted under the pseudonym \"One of the Quantity\") was announced as the winner on 4 November 1859, the prize again being ten guineas (thousands of dollars in today's values). The song was used in South Australian schools and elsewhere, and a popular gramophone recording was made by Peter Dawson in 1933. Sir Bernard Heinze is reported as much preferring Linger's composition to \"Advance Australia Fair\", which has been criticised as derivative of the German folk song \"The Polish Inn\". In 1887 W. B. Chinner (son of one of the judges) wrote a choral arrangement of the Song with piano accompaniment, which became popular.
