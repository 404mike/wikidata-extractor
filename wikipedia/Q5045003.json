Although her birthdate is generally given as 1820, this may have been a useful fiction, as baptism records give the 1811 date.She was highly intelligent and received a good education. She could converse in French and Italian, as well as being well-versed in Latin; she played pianoforte and harp.  In 1836, at West Hackney (perhaps on York Road near modern Dalston?), she married Charles James Carleton, a medical student working at Guy's Hospital and who could claim a family connection with the Earls of Dorchester. Together with their two young children (James Poole Carleton born 23 April 1839 and one other) they left for Australia in 1839, on the Prince Regent. It was a rough passage and both children died and were buried at sea. The passengers disembarked at Glenelg on 26 September 1839.", "link_mentions": {}}}
