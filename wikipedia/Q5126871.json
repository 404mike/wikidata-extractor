He sat in the House of Commons from 1906 to 1910, but his most significant public service was his participation in numerous government committees.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wednesbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Clarendon Hyde", "At the 1906 general election, Green retired and in his place, the Conservatives nominated Alfred Bird, head of the manufacturers of Bird's Custard to defend the seat. The Liberals nominated Clarendon Hyde, a businessman, as their candidate. The Liberals polled well throughout the country, and they won a large majority in the House of Commons. Wednesbury was one of the seats the party gained from the Conservatives, and Hyde won a majority of 944 votes."]}, {"page": "Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart", "response": ["Lord Ninian's campaign for election was based on reform of the poor law and extending the age range of the old age pension. He also stated of his desire of preserving and strengthening the military forces of Britain. He lost the election to Liberal candidate David Alfred Thomas in January 1910 but did manage to reduce the majority by half from the previous election in 1906. Despite his defeat, his popularity among voters was increasing and at the end of the election campaign a crowd of thousands of people came to see Crichton-Stuart and his wife travel to the train station. The crowd gathered outside the Angel Hotel where the couple were staying and, when they left, their carriage was pulled by around 60 volunteers. The procession stopped briefly outside Cardiff Conservative Club where Crichton-Stuart shook hands with numerous people and gave a short speech before continuing to the station. The Evening Express remarked on the procession, stating \"never before has a parliamentary candidate, victorious or defeated, been so honoured by the people of Cardiff\". On the polling day, Lord Ninian's son caught a chill being driven around Cardiff and later died. He was buried near Falkland Palace in Fife. Crichton-Stuart and his family did not permanently reside in Cardiff until he and his wife moved there in April 1910, moving into Penylan Court which had previously been the residence of William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely. A second election was held in December 1910 following a hung parliament, in which Crichton-Stuart was successful, taking the seat from the Liberal candidate Clarendon Hyde, with a majority of 299 votes, a turnaround of 1,800 votes in the space of ten months. With a history in the military, the majority of the issues he raised before parliament concerned the armed forces, including the high costs officers were faced with during manoeuvres and a petition to improve the weaponry provided to the British cavalry units."]}, {"page": "Longworth", "response": ["Longworth's original manor house dates from the early 17th century, when it was built by a judge, Sir Henry Marten, about a mile south of the village on the edge of the Vale of White Horse. It was occupied later by his son, Henry Marten, the regicide and republican. In the 20th century, it was home to Sir Clarendon Hyde, a Liberal MP and businessman. Today's manor house, Longworth House, was originally known as Manor Farm. It stands just west of the parish church. It was built in the late 17th century and remodelled and extended in the early 20th century. It is a Grade II listed building. It was home to Colonel Granville Walton, a leading Scout."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Sir Clarendon Hyde \u2013 Liberal MP"]}, {"page": "Walford Davis Green", "response": ["He was elected at the 1895 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough Wednesbury in Staffordshire. He was re-elected in 1900, and held the seat until he stood down from Parliament at the 1906 general election. After he had announced his intention to retire on health grounds, the local Unionist Association selected as its candidate F. E. Muntz, who had contested Rugby in 1900. However, Muntz was himself forced to withdraw due to ill-health, and consideration was given to asking Green to stand again, since his health had improved. The Times reported that the Liberal Party candidate Clarendon Hyde had been nursing the constituency for some time, and that local unionists wanted Green to reconsider his retirement. However, Green did not stand again and the Unionist candidate Alfred Bird lost the seat to Clarendon Hyde."]}, {"page": "Clarendon Golding Hyde", "response": ["#REDIRECT Clarendon Hyde "]}, {"page": "Sir Clarendon Golding Hyde", "response": ["#REDIRECT Clarendon Hyde "]}, {"page": "Sir Clarendon Hyde", "response": ["#REDIRECT Clarendon Hyde "]}, {"page": "Sir C.
