Britain and France enlisted Israeli support for an alliance against Egypt. The parties agreed that Israel would invade the Sinai. Britain and France would then intervene, purportedly to separate the warring Israeli and Egyptian forces, instructing both to withdraw to a distance of 16 kilometres from either side of the canal.The Protocol of Sevres 1956 Anatomy of a War Plot. University of Oxford. Retrieved September 8, 2011. The British and French would then argue, according to the plan, that Egypt's control of such an important route was too tenuous, and that it needed be placed under Anglo-French management. The agreement at S\u00e8vres was initially described by British Prime Minister Anthony Eden as the \"highest form of statesmanship\". The three allies, especially Israel, were mainly successful in attaining their immediate military objectives. However, the extremely hostile reaction to the Suez Crisis from both the United States and the USSR forced them to withdraw, resulting in a failure of Britain and France's political and strategic aims of controlling the Suez Canal."]}, {"page": "Selwyn Lloyd", "response": ["Lloyd was in the House of Commons on 24 October, so was not present when the secret Protocol of Sevres was signed.

Later that morning Eden informed the Cabinet about the consultation with Pineau the previous evening.

Radford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was willing to help so long as the dormant American claim to the island was not prejudiced. The lease on the island facilities, including the airfield and the port, had been granted to SPAL with a clause in the contract that said it could be terminated if there was a military necessity to do so. The Americans proposed that the British tell SPAL that they were establishing an airbase on the island, and that the United States would support this so long as SPAL was paid fair compensation. An official letter was sent to the president of SPAL on 1 May 1956, withdrawing the permit to operate from Christmas Island, regretting any inconvenience, and offering to consider compensation."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to the United States", "response": ["*1965\u20131969: Sir Patrick Dean"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom\u2013United States relations", "response": ["After Kennedy's assassination President Lyndon B.
