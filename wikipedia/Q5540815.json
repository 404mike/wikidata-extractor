During the 1890\u201391 season his strong club play brought him to the attention of the English selectors, and he was brought into the annual North vs. South match.Griffiths (2000), pg 27. This in turn led to Marsh being selected for the 1892 Home Nations Championship in the game against Ireland, playing again at threequarters alongside Dicky Lockwood and George Hubbard. The English team was victorious, but Marsh was not selected for the team again. It is unknown if this was due to sanctions or actions taken by the rugby unions or if it was a selection choice."]}, {"page": "Hubbard, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Hubbard"]}]}}
