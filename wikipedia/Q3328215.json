He was boxing's inaugural and first Undisputed world Super-Middleweight champion, having won the inaugural IBF's version in 1984.\nMurray Sutherland turned professional in 1977 and in 1981 challenged WBC Light Heavyweight Title holder Matthew Saad Muhammad, but lost by KO in the 9th round. Matthew Saad Muhammad was later quoted as saying that Sutherland was the toughest fight of his career. The following year he took on WBA Light Heavyweight Title holder Michael Spinks but lost via TKO in the eighth round. In 1984 he captured the Vacant IBF Super Middleweight Title with a decision win over Ernie Singletary. His win was notable because he was the first IBF titleholder to actually win an IBF belt with victory from an actual fight. He lost the belt in his first defence to Chong-Pal Park. He retired in 1986 after being KO'd by Lindell Holmes.\nIn 1983, Murray Sutherland fought ten rounds with Thomas Hearns in a Middleweight fight, losing a unanimous decision.\nSutherland was also ranked 1st in the world in the Professional Karate Association before he started his boxing career.\nHe ran a successful gym in Bay City, Michigan for several years and currently lives in Midland, Michigan and works for a restoration firm with a good friend and teaches self-defense classes at local gyms.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bobby Czyz", "response": ["|align=left| Murray Sutherland"]}, {"page": "Thomas Hearns", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Murray Sutherland"]}, {"page": "Michael Spinks", "response": ["1979 saw Spinks get less than three minutes of boxing action inside a ring, with his only fight ending in a first round knockout of Marc Hans, but in 1980, Spinks took his ascent towards the top to another level, when he beat future IBF super-middleweight champion Murray Sutherland, David Conteh, and fringe contenders Ramon Ronquillo and Alvaro Yaqui Lopez (who challenged for a world title four times).
