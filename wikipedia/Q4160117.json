The last rulers of this dynasty both called themselves Sultan from 1394 to 1397: Nasir ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughlaq, the grandson of Firuz Shah Tughlaq who ruled from Delhi, and Nasir ud-Din Nusrat Shah Tughlaq, another relative of Firuz Shah Tughlaq who ruled from Firozabad, which was a few miles from Delhi.Vincent A Smith, , Chapter 2, pp 248-254, Oxford University Press The battle between the two relatives continued till Timur's invasion in 1398. Timur, also known as Tamerlane in Western scholarly literature, was the Turkicized Mongol ruler of the Timurid Empire. He became aware of the weakness and quarreling of the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate, so he marched with his army to Delhi, plundering and killing all the way.Peter Jackson (1999), The Delhi Sultanate: A Political and Military History, Cambridge University Press, pp 312\u2013317 Estimates for the massacre by Timur in Delhi range from 100,000 to 200,000 people.Lionel Trotter (1906), History of India: From the Earliest Times to the Present Day, Gorham Publishers London/New York, pp 74Annemarie Schimmel (1997), Islam in the Indian Subcontinent, Brill Academic, , pp 36-37; Also see: Elliot, Studies in Indian History, 2nd Edition, pp 98-101 Timur had no intention of staying in or ruling India. He looted the lands he crossed, then plundered and burnt Delhi. Over five days, Timur and his army raged a massacre. Then he collected wealth, captured women, and enslaved people (particularly skilled artisans), and returning with this loot to Samarkand. The people and lands within the Delhi Sultanate were left in a state of anarchy, chaos, and pestilence. Nasir ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughlaq, who had fled to Gujarat during Timur's invasion, returned and nominally ruled as the last ruler of Tughlaq dynasty, as a puppet of various factions at the court.Annemarie Schimmel, Islam in the Indian Subcontinent, , Brill Academic, Chapter 2", "The historian Peter Jackson explains in The New Cambridge History of Islam: \"The elite of the early Delhi sultanate comprised overwhelmingly first generation immigrants from Persia and Central Asia: Persians (\u2018T\u0101j\u012bks\u2019), Turks, Gh\u016br\u012bs and also Khalaj from the hot regions (garms\u012br) of modern Afghanistan."]}, {"page": "The Travels of Marco Polo", "response": ["Since Dominican fathers had among their missions that of evangelizing foreign peoples (cf. the role of Dominican missionaries in ChinaNatalis Alexandre, 1699, Apologia de'padri domenicani missionarii della China and in the Indies Giovanni Michele, 1696 Galleria de'Sommi Pontefici, patriarchi, arcivescovi, e vescovi dell'ordine de'Predicatori, vol.2, p. 5), it is reasonable to think that they considered Marco's book as a trustworthy piece of information for missions in the East.

He is said to have ordered the massacre of all the inhabitants of the Hindu city of Kanauj. He also decided to transfer his capital from Delhi to Devagiri, which are 600 miles apart, then ordered the people to move back to Delhi. Thousands of people including women and children died during the journey. However, Muhammad bin Tughluq was also known for his tolerance to other religions.  Several historians mention that the Sultan honoured the Jain monk Jinaprabha Suri during the year 1328. Peter Jackson mentions that Muhammad was the only Sultan who participated in Hindu festivities.", "There are conflicting views expressed by historians on his religious tolerance. While visitors Ibn Battuta, Nunez and Firistha mention that Muhammed Bin Tughlaq showed  intolerance to other religions, on the contrary, Peter Jackson mentions that Muhammed was the only Sultan who participated in Hindu festivities. Ibn Battuta mentions that the king of China (the Yuan Emperor) had sent an embassy to Muhammad for reconstruction of a sacked temple at Sambhal. The envoys were however denied with the statement that only those living in a Muslim territory who paid the jizya could be permitted to restore a temple. Firuz Shah Tughlaq had claimed that before his rule, idol-temples had been permitted to be rebuilt contrary to the Sharia."]}, {"page": "Tughlaq dynasty", "response": ["The ancestry of the dynasty is debated among modern historians because the earlier sources provide different information regarding it. Tughluq's court poet Badr-i Chach attempted to find a royal Sassanian genealogy for the dynasty from the line of Bahram Gur, which seems to be the official position of the genealogy of the Sultan, although this can be dismissed as flattery. The Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta states that Tughluq belonged to the \"Qarauna tribe of the Turks\", who lived in the hilly region between Turkestan and Sindh, based on the claim of a Sufi saint Rukn-e-Alam. However, this is not corroborated by other contemporary sources. Qara'unas were Mongols or associated with Mongol armies, whom Tughlaq despised, and it is unlikely that Tughlaq was a Qara'una. Another Tughluq's court poet Amir Khusrau in his Tughluq Nama makes no mention of Tughluq's arrival in India from a foreign land, which seems to imply he was born in India. His own court poet states that Tughluq described himself frankly as a man of no importance (\"awara mard\") in his early life and career. The historian Ferishta, based on inquiries at Lahore, wrote that the knowledgeable historians and the books of India had neglected to mention any clear statement on the origin of the dynasty, but wrote that there was a rural founding myth that Tughluq's father was a Turkic slave of Balban who made an alliance with a Jatt chieftain of Punjab, and that Tughluq's mother may have been a Jatt lady. However there is no contemporary sources corroborate this statement. The historian Fouzia Ahmed points out that as per Amir Khusrau's assertion, Tughluq was not a Balbanid slave because he was not part of the old Turkic nobility and his family only became emergent during Khalji rule. Instead, Tughluq expressed his loyalty to the ethnically heterogenous Khalji regime through which he first entered military service rather than to Balban because his father was never part of Balban's old Sultanate household. According to historian Peter Jackson, Tughlaq was of Mongol or Turko-Mongol stock."]}, {"page": "Persecution of Hindus", "response": ["Muslim texts of that period are replete with iconoclast rhetoric, descriptions of mass-slaughter of Hindus, and repeats ad nauseam about \"the army of Islam obtain[ing] abundant wealth and unlimited riches\" from the conquered sites. The Hindus are described in these Islamic texts as infidels, Hindustan as war zone (\"Dar-al-Harb\"), and attacks on pagan Hindus as a part of a holy war (jihad), states Peter Jackson. However, states Wink, this killing was not systematic and \"was normally confined to the fighting men\" though the wars and episodes of routine violence did precipitate a great famine with civilian casualties in tens of thousands. The pervasive and most striking feature of the Arabic literature on Sind and Hind of the 11th to 13th-century is its constant obsession with idol worship and polytheism in the Indian subcontinent.Yohanan Friedmann (1975), Medieval Muslim Views of Indian Religions, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Volume 95, Number 2, pp. 214-217,  There is piecemeal evidence of iconoclasm that began in Sind region, but the wholesale and more systematic onslaught against major Hindu religious monuments is evidenced in North India.", "The second half of the 13th-century witnessed raids on Hindu kingdoms by Muslim forces controlling the northwest and north India, states Peter Jackson. These did not lead to sustained persecution of the Hindus in the targeted kingdoms, because the Muslim armies merely looted the Hindus, took cattle and slaves, then left. The raids caused suffering, yet also rallied the Islamic faithfuls and weakened the infidel prince by weakening his standing among his Hindu subjects. These raids were into Rajput kingdoms, those in central India, Lakhnawti\u2013Awadh, and in eastern regions such as Bihar.", "The Delhi Sultanate started in the 13th-century and continued through the early 16th-century, when the Mughal conquest replaced it. The Delhi Sultans of this period saw themselves first and foremost as Islamic rulers, states Peter Jackson, for the \"people of Islam\". They were emphatically not \"sultan of the Hindus\". The Muslim texts of the Delhi Sultanate era treated Hindus with disdain, remarking \"Hindus are never interesting in themselves, but only as converts, as capitation tax payers, or as corpses\". These medieval Muslim rulers were \"protecting and advancing the Islamic faith\", with two Muslim texts of this period remarking that the Sultan had a duty \"eradicate infidelity and humiliate his Hindu subjects\"."]}, {"page": "Ghazan", "response": ["Ghazan was one of a long line of Mongol leaders who engaged in diplomatic communications with the Europeans and Crusaders in attempts to form a Franco-Mongol alliance against their common enemy, primarily the Egyptian Mamluks. He already had the use of forces from Christian vassal countries such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia. The plan was to coordinate actions between Ghazan's forces, the Christian military orders, and the aristocracy of Cyprus to defeat the Egyptians, after which Jerusalem would be returned to the Europeans.\"The Trial of the Templars\", Malcolm Barber, 2nd edition, page 22: \"The aim was to link up with Ghazan, the Mongol Il-Khan of Persia, who had invited the Cypriots to participate in joint operations against the Mamluks\". Many Europeans are known to have worked for Ghazan, such as Isol the Pisan or Buscarello de Ghizolfi, often in high positions. Hundreds of such Western adventurers entered into the service of Mongol rulers.Roux, p. 410. According to historian Peter Jackson, the 14th century saw such a vogue of Mongol things in the West that many new-born children in Italy were named after Mongol rulers, including Ghazan: names such as Can Grande (\"Great Khan\"), Alaone (Hulagu, Ghazan's great-grandfather), Argone (Arghun, Ghazan's father) or Cassano (Ghazan) were recorded with a high frequency.Peter Jackson, The Mongols and the West, p. 315."]}, {"page": "Firishta", "response": ["Contemporary scholars and historians variously write that the works of Firishta drew from Tabaqat-i-Akbari by Nizamud-din, Tarikh-i-Rashidi by Mirza Haider and Barani's Tarikh.
