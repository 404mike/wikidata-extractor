She and her husband, Tom, were at the centre of the 25 year long Burston School Strike. Their battle with authority is celebrated annually by a rally that attracts nationally known politicians and trade unionists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burston Strike School", "response": ["The Burston Strike School was founded as a consequence of a school strike and became the centre of the longest running strike in British history, that lasted from 1914 to 1939 in the village of Burston in Norfolk, England. Today, the building stands as a museum to the strike. Every year hundreds of people turn up for a rally to commemorate the 25-year strike over the jobs of Annie Higdon and her husband.", "The strike began when teachers at the village's Church of England school, Annie Higdon and her husband, Tom Higdon, were sacked after a dispute with the area's school management committee. The schoolchildren \u2013 led by Violet Potter \u2013 went on strike in their support. Encouraged by the community, the Higdons went on to set up an alternative school which was initially attended by 66 of their 72 former pupils. Beginning in a marquee on the village green, the school moved to a local carpenter's premises and later to a purpose-built school financed by donations from the labour movement. Burston Strike School carried on teaching local children until shortly after Tom's death in 1939."]}, {"page": "School strikes of 1911", "response": ["The Great Unrest period from 1911 to 1914 would see a number of other school strikes, most notably the Burston Strike School, where students striked in support of Annie Higdon, a teacher who had been fired for complaining about dire conditions in schools and who was a socialist who had spoken out in favour of local farm labourers.Pamela Horn, \"Higdon , Annie Catharine [Kitty] (1864\u20131946)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2008.
