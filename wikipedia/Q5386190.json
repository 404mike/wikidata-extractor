In October 1964, Higginson suffered the ignominy of being the first Brentford player to be sent off since the resumption of football after the Second World War, when he, along with opposition player Eric Brodie, was sent off during a league match versus Shrewsbury Town. The News of the World Football Annual stated that Higginson once passed back to his own goalkeeper from a corner kick. In 1967 and with Brentford in a dire financial situation and the subject of a takeover bid by rivals Queens Park Rangers, Higginson volunteered to take part in a Brentford to Brighton walk, to raise funds for the club. While many volunteers gave up, Higginson walked the whole way. Higginson remained with Brentford until the end of the 1969\u201370 season and was awarded a testimonial versus Queens Park Rangers in April 1969, earning \u00a31,853 from a 6,620 crowd. He made 433 appearances for the Bees and is fifth on the club's record appearances list. He was posthumously inducted into the Brentford Hall of Fame in December 2016."]}, {"page": "1968\u201369 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Eric Brodie"]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Eric Brodie"]}, {"page": "Brodie, Eric", "response": ["#redirectEric Brodie"]}]}}
