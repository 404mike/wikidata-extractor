He has exhibited internationally, including La Biennale de Montr\u00e9al in 2000 and International Biennial of Contemporary Art of Seville in 2005. In 2008, his video, SCLPTR (2005), was included in California Video at the Getty Center, curated by Glenn Phillips.Macdonald's videos, drawings and sculptures are informed by philosophical, musical, literary and popular references. They often depict everyday scenes while examining landscape, entropy, stillness, noise, and duration. In his essay Responsiveness Testing, Ralph Rugoff, director of the Hayward Gallery, London, writes: \"Macdonald quietly unsettles the viewers faith about what exactly is  - or is not - happening in the picture he or she is looking at. ... These pockets of uncertainty are enhanced by Macdonald\u2019s deliberately style-less or impersonal approach to making images.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April's Shower", "response": ["* Euan Macdonald as Fergus"]}, {"page": "List of LGBT-related films of 2003", "response": ["|April's Shower ||  || United States || Comedy || Trish Doolan, Maria Cina, Joe Tabbanella, Denise Miller, Zack Ward, Samantha Lemole, Molly Cheek, Victoria Reiniger, Euan Macdonald, Lara Harris, Delaina Mitchell, Jane Booke, Randall Batinkoffl, Frank Grillo, Honey Labrador, Arly Jover, Gizelle D'Cole, Pamela Salem, Precious Chong, Jeffrey Gorman, Raymond O'Connor, Steve Portigiani and John Hardison ||"]}, {"page": "Myfanwy Macleod", "response": ["Hammertown was a touring exhibition curated by Reid Shier and co-presented by the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh, Scotland (2002), Contemporary Art Gallery in Vancouver (2002), and the Winnipeg Art Gallery, Manitoba (2004).
