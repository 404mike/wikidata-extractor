In his early years, Fraser was curator of the Museum of the Zoological Society of London.Little is known about Fraser's early life. He was born in 1819 or 1820 and married Mary Ann Harrison on 17 February 1844. A son Oscar L. Fraser worked as an assistant in the Indian Museum at Calcutta around 1888. He worked for fourteen years at the museum of the Zoological Society of London. He worked with the anatomist Richard Owen on studies of the emu and rhea. He participated in the Niger expedition of 1841 as the African Civilization Society's scientist, with Allen and Thomson. He stayed on in Fernando Po and collected. Upon his return he became in charge of Lord Derby's collection at Knowsley Hall. In 1846 he was sent by Lord Derby to collect in north Africa. In 1848 he became conservator at Knowsley. He wrote Zoologica Typica, or figures of the new and rare animals and birds in the collection  of the Zoological Society of London, a lavishly illustrated large-sized book, published in 1849. In this book he described many new species of birds. In 1850, Fraser was appointed Consul of Quidah, Dahomey (now Benin), West Africa. Around 1857\u20131859, he collected birds and mammals in Ecuador for Philip Lutley Sclater of the Zoological Society of London, and the year after in California. Upon his return to London, he opened a shop in Regent Street, London, selling exotic birds. The last years of his life he spent in America.Fraser wrote a Catalogue of the Knowsley Collections (1850) and described several new species including the Derbyan parakeet Psittacula derbiana named after his employer. A number of species and subspecies have been named in his honour, including Fraser's anole (Anolis fraseri ), Fraser's ground snake (Liophis epinephelus fraseri ), a centipede snake (Tantilla fraseri ), Fraser's eagle-owl (Bubo poensis), Fraser's warbler (Myiothlypis fraseri ), and Fraser's musk shrew (Crocidura poensis).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of ornithologists", "response": ["*Louis Fraser \u2013 England"]}, {"page": "Bight of Biafra", "response": ["*May 1852\u20141853           Louis Fraser"]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Fraser \u2013 Louis Fraser (1810\u20131866)"]}, {"page": "Oriole finch", "response": ["The oriole finch was formally described in 1843 by the British zoologist Louis Fraser under the binomial name Coccothraustes olivaceus. The volume is dated 1842 on the title page but the article was published in 1843. It is now the only species placed in the genus Linurgus that was introduced by Ludwig Reichenbach in 1850. The exact relationship of this species to other finches is unclear. In their phylogenetic analysis published in 2012, Zuccon and colleagues found that the oriole finch was sister to the genus Serinus. This contrasts with an earlier 2009 analysis by Nguembock and colleagues which found that the oriole finch was sister to the genus Carduelis."]}, {"page": "Giant conebill", "response": ["The taxonomy is complicated. The giant conebill was formally described in 1860 by the English zoologist Philip Sclater from a specimen collected by Louis Fraser. Sclater coined the binomial name Oreomanes fraseri. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that the giant conebill was embedded in a clade containing members of the genus Conirostrum. As Conirostrum d\u2019Orbigny & Lafresnaye, 1838, was introduced before Oreomanes Sclater, 1860, Conirostrum has priority and Oreomanes was merged into Conirostrum. But as the cinereous conebill has a recognised subspecies, Conirostrum cinereum fraseri Sclater, 1859, the specific name of the giant conebill was changed to that of its junior synonym Oreomanes binghami. This had been introduced in 1919 by the American ornithologist Frank Chapman based on a specimen collected near Machu Picchu in Peru.  The specific epithet was chosen to honour Hiram Bingham. The giant conebill is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised."]}, {"page": "Spotted bolo mouse", "response": ["Necromys punctulatus is known from a single specimen in the Natural History Museum, London which was originally collected by the British zoologist Louis Fraser in Ecuador between 1857 and 1859. For a long time this was thought to be a subspecies of the short-tailed cane mouse (Zygodontomys brevicauda) but in 1991, the American zoologist Robert S. Voss examined the type specimen and came to the conclusion that it had many features in common with the hairy-tailed bolo mouse (Necromys lasiurus), then classified as Bolomys lasiurus, and placed it in the same genus, as Bolomys punctata. Both have since been transferred to the new genus Necromys."]}, {"page": "Fraser's eagle-owl", "response": ["Fraser's eagle-owl (Bubo poensis) is a species of African owl in the family Strigidae.
