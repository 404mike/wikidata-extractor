He played a total of 475 games in all competitions for his seven league clubs, scoring 153 goals in a career which lasted from 1970 until 1985. McCulloch was a centre forward in the \"target man\" mould, being 6 ft 2in (1.88 m) tall, he was good in the air, using his strong physique to hold off defenders and lay the ball off to teammates. He made one appearance for the Scotland national under 23 team.McCulloch was born in Northampton on 3 January 1950. He was the son of Adam McCulloch who played over 200 league games for Northampton Town, Shrewsbury Town and Aldershot. Andy was brought up in Hampshire, the family moving there when his father signed for Aldershot in 1953. On leaving school he attended university and obtained a Civil engineering degree before playing full-time football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["His priority in summer 1978 was to find a target man for Tommy Tynan to play alongside and he found it in  Andrew McCulloch, who arrived from Brentford for a \u00a370,000 fee. He signed Terry Curran as a winger but eventually moved him up front to play alongside McCulloch. He sold goalkeeper Chris Turner to Sunderland and replaced him with the bigger Bob Bolder. He further raised the average height of the team by signing uncompromising centre-half Mick Pickering from Southampton. The team failed to advance in the league, finishing the 1978\u201379 season again in 14th spot. They did make their mark on the FA Cup in the Third Round by taking eventual winners Arsenal to four replays before they eventually succumbed to a 2\u20130 defeat."]}, {"page": "McCulloch", "response": ["*Andrew McCulloch (footballer) (fl. 1970-1985), British soccer player", "*Andrew McCulloch (writer and actor) (born 1945), British television writer and actor", "*Andrew McCulloch (drummer) (born 1946), British drummer for King Crimson and others"]}, {"page": "Walton & Hersham F.C.", "response": ["*  Andrew McCulloch"]}, {"page": "West London derby", "response": ["* Andrew McCulloch \u2013 first for QPR, then Brentford."]}, {"page": "Andrew McCulloch", "response": ["Andrew McCulloch may refer to:", "*Andrew McCulloch (civil engineer) (1864\u20131945), Chief Engineer of the Kettle Valley Railway in Canada", "*Andrew McCulloch (British Army officer) (1876\u20131960), commander of 52nd Lowland Division from 1934\u20131935", "*Andrew McCulloch (politician) (died 1908), Australian politician", "*Andrew McCulloch (drummer) (born 1945), English drummer", "*Andrew McCulloch (writer) (born 1945), British television writer and actor", "*Andrew McCulloch (footballer) (born 1950), English/Scottish footballer between 1970 and 1985"]}, {"page": "Andy McCulloch (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew McCulloch (footballer)"]}]}}
