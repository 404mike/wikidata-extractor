His stay at the Old Showground was brief, as he moved on to Doncaster Rovers. \"Donny\" were relegated out of the Third Division in 1966\u201367, with Lindsey playing 18 matches at Belle Vue. He dropped into Southern League football with Bill Leivers's Cambridge United. His non-league stint at the Abbey Stadium was to last only the one season as in January 1969 he signed with Southend United, who paid Cambridge \u00a35,000 plus Mel Slack. The \"Shrimpers\" finished seventh in the Fourth Division in 1968\u201369, and then 17th in 1969\u201370 and then 18th in 1970\u201371 under Arthur Rowley's stewardship. Lindsey scored four goals in 91 league games in his three years at Roots Hall. In December 1971, Port Vale manager Gordon Lee paid a \"small fee\" to secure his services. After making his debut in a 3\u20131 defeat by Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park on 22 January, he enjoyed regular football until the end of the 1971\u201372 season with 16 Third Division appearances to his name. However, after nine appearances in the 1972\u201373 season, he lost his first team place at Vale Park in October. He was loaned to Andy Nelson's Gillingham in December 1972, and was signed permanently the following month for a \u00a3500 fee. He scored four goals in 39 appearances in the 1973\u201374 campaign as the \"Gills\" won promotion out of the Fourth Division in second place. New boss Len Ashurst then led the club to a tenth-place finish in the league above in 1974\u201375. He scored five goals in 73 league games during his time at Priestfield. He then moved back into the Southern League with Dartford."]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Cambridge United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Mel Slack"]}, {"page": "2016 in association football", "response": ["* 6 August: Mel Slack, English footballer (born 1944)"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Mel Slack, 72, footballer (Southend United, Cambridge United)."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 in English football", "response": ["* 6 August 2016: Mel Slack, 72, Sunderland, Southend United and Cambridge United midfielder.Tribute after ex-Cambridge United hard-tackling midfielder Mel Slack dies "]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2016", "response": ["*Mel Slack, 72, English footballer (Southend United, Cambridge United).Tribute after ex-Cambridge United hard-tackling midfielder Mel Slack dies"]}]}}
