No scenes take place in any of the personal areas, however; only public areas made it to the screen. While the digital paintings in Winston's home were created with  green screen technology, the concept was based on technology that was already available in the real world. The characters even refer to Bill Gates' house which, in real life, had such art. The paintings which appeared for Hoffman were of a cartoon character, \"Alien Kitty\", developed by Floyd Hughes specifically for the film.Howitt (commentary), 1:16:37"]}, {"page": "Revolver (comics)", "response": ["| Purple Days || 1\u20137 || 72 || Charles Shaar Murray || Floyd Hughes"]}, {"page": "Horatio Weisfeld", "response": ["In 1997 rap mogul Russell Simmons struck a deal to develop an \u201curban\u201d spin-off of Mad Magazine with Time/Warner Publishing.
