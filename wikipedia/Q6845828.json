C. Fields and Groucho Marx, always finding room at the end of the evening for some hot-club-style guitar instrumentals, often with the assistance of some unsuspecting second guitarist invited up from the audience. He was also employed by the BBC as compere for a number of shows, including introducing The Beatles on their first London concert. As arguably the \"folk world\"'s then most competent performer in the area of jazzy guitar accompaniment he collaborated with fiddle player Dave Swarbrick on several ragtime tunes the 1967 Dave Swarbrick album, Rags, Reels & Airs, along with singer-guitarist Martin Carthy on the more folk-based material. Disley also played guitar accompaniment to Mike Absalom on the latter's 1968 album, Save the Last Gherkin for Me. By the 1970s, he was one of the folk scene's busiest artists and a mainstay of folk festivals as musician and compere."]}, {"page": "Absalom (name)", "response": ["* Mike Absalom (born 1940), English folk singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "List of songs about Paris", "response": ["* \"Montmartre Cafe\" by Mike Absalom"]}, {"page": "Absalom, Mike", "response": ["#redirectMike Absalom"]}, {"page": "List of harpists", "response": ["* Mike Absalom"]}]}}
