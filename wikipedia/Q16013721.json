The gold coronet, with diamonds set in platinum, was made for and used by Prince Charles at his investiture as Prince of Wales in 1969. Designed by the artist Louis Osman, the coronet was a gift from the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to the Prince's mother, Queen Elizabeth II. It has been described as modern but its form is traditional. The coronet is on permanent display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.", "The coronet follows the form laid down by King Charles II in 1677 by having just one arch rather than the traditional two arches or four half-arches of British monarchs' crowns to show that the Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal princes and dukes. Though based on this traditional design, the coronet has a futurist look that was popular in the 1960s, and it was created by the eccentric designer Louis Osman.", "The frame was made by electroplating gold onto the inside of an epoxy resin cast. B.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. Electroplating Co., a precious-metal electroformers, was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to make a fibreglass-reinforced polyester mould of a wax model of the coronet that Louis Osman had made using a wooden template. From this mould a negative epoxy resin cast was produced. B.\u00a0J.\u00a0S. involved Engelhard Industries to assist in the electroforming of the cast. David Mason was Head of Research at Engelhard and was assigned the task of doing the electroforming at the company's headquarters in the Forest of Dean. Until then, electroforming an object of that size had never been attempted anywhere in the world, and it was the first crown to be made in this way."]}, {"page": "Shere", "response": ["The church of St James is in the Early English style, most being 12th, 13th and 14th century.

In reality these two members and others joined the expedition in the spring of 1937 when the team extended their efforts to excavating not just at Chagar Bazar but also Tell Brak.Morgan. (p. 213). The chronology then reverts to being correct when the Mallowans finish at these sites and move for a short period of time to the Balikh Valley in 1938. In 1939 the international situation was deemed to be too dangerous to continue and the Mallowans did not recommence their archaeological work until 1947 with another surveying expedition, this time returning to Iraq.Morgan.

He approached Jacob Epstein for a Virgin and Child that would \"levitate\" above the arch and specified that it should be cast in lead which was plentiful from the bombed roofs. However, Osman did not inform the mother superior that the sculptor was Jewish, which may have been an objection among some Catholics at the time. However, the Arts Council congratulated her on her \"innovative choice of artist\" and Epstein's work was unveiled in 1953.Ornamental Passions website, accessed 24 May 2013 This work is Grade II* listed (protected in the mid-rarity category)."]}, {"page": "Hele's School, Exeter", "response": ["* Louis Osman, architect, artist, goldsmith.
