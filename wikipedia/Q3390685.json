Frank Philip Bowden and David Tabor (1950) showed that, at a microscopic level, the actual area of contact between surfaces is a very small fraction of the apparent area.  This actual area of contact, caused by asperities increases with pressure. The development of the atomic force microscope (ca. 1986)  enabled scientists to study friction at the atomic scale, showing that, on that scale, dry friction is the product of the inter-surface shear stress and the contact area. These two discoveries explain Amonton's first law (below); the macroscopic proportionality between normal force and static frictional force between dry surfaces."]}, {"page": "Tribology", "response": ["Other pioneers of tribology research are Australian physicist Frank Philip Bowden and British physicist David Tabor, both of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. Together they wrote the seminal textbook The Friction and Lubrication of Solids (Part\u00a0I originally published in 1950 and Part II in 1964). Michael J. Neale was another leader in the field during the mid-to-late 1900s. He specialized in solving problems in machine design by applying his knowledge of tribology. Neale was respected as an educator with a gift for integrating theoretical work with his own practical experience to produce easy-to-understand design guides. The Tribology Handbook, which he first edited in 1973 and updated in 1995, is still used around the world and forms the basis of numerous training courses for engineering designers."]}, {"page": "Institution of Mechanical Engineers", "response": ["|David Tabor"]}, {"page": "Surface forces apparatus", "response": ["The Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) is a scientific instrument which measures the interaction force of two surfaces as they are brought together and retracted using multiple beam interferometry to monitor surface separation and directly measure contact area and observe any surface deformations occurring in the contact zone.  One surface is held by a cantilevered spring, and the deflection of the spring is used to calculate the force being exerted. The technique was pioneered by David Tabor and R.H.S. Winterton in the late 1960s at Cambridge University. By the mid-1970s, J.N. Israelachvili had adapted the original design to operate in liquids, notably aqueous solutions, while at the Australian National University, and further advanced the technique to support friction and electro-chemical surface studies while at the University of California Santa Barbara."]}, {"page": "2005 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 26 November \u2013 David Tabor, physicist (born 1913)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2005", "response": ["*David Tabor, 92, British physicist."]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* David Tabor"]}, {"page": "1913 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 23 October \u2013 David Tabor, physicist (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "Frank Philip Bowden", "response": ["In 1957, Bowden became Reader of Physics at Cambridge, and in 1966 became the Professor of Surface Physics.
