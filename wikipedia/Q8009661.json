Gardiner is known for his works in chamber music, symphony orchestra, and classical music ensembles in addition to his electronic compositions. His most notable works are Hebbian Theory, Prism (for string orchestra) and Hedgehog. ", "William Gardiner was born in Sydney into a family of early musical aficionados. He performed in classical music ensembles and also was a member of a rock band when he attended high school. William commonly played the violin and drums when he was younger, and later moved on to playing the guitar, piano (reworked piano) and composed electronic sound using technology. It was his involvement in music during high school that led him to compose his own music. He studied art and law at University of Sydney, and later left Australia to study at Yale University to earn his Doctorate degree in music- under the mentoring of David Lang. William was influenced by classical composers such as Bach, Astor Piazzolla, Latvian P\u0113teris Vasks, George Crumb and Alfred Schnittke; and was also inspired by the works of his fellow Australian composers Matthew Hindson, Paul Stanhope, Anne Boyd, Michael Smetanin and Damien Ricketson.", "In 2015, William Gardiner was awarded the '13 MM, '15 MMA of the National Composition Contest by American Composers Forum.", "William Gardiner was sponsored by the Ian Potter Cultural Trust to attempt to raise $7,000 to enter upon earning a Masters of Music in composition and work with David Lang for a year. The project dates ran from August 2011 to May 2012."]}, {"page": "William Bickerstaffe", "response": ["Bickerstaffe's was well known among his parishes as a charitable and humorous man. He supported Sunday schools in Leicester and Aylestone with his unpaid labour and charitable donations, even while he was \"a poor curate, unsupported by private property\", as he described himself at fifty-eight; Bickerstaffe survived, for most of his life, on his meager schoolmaster's salary of \u00a319 6s, supplemented with the wage of a curate. He used his (admittedly limited) medical knowledge to help the ill in his parishes, and donated the small surplus that came of his wages to local charitable causes. Both John Throsby and John Nichols reproduced satirical or humorous anecdotes of Bickstaffe's in their works. One such anecdote, recorded by Nichols, records an event where the clerk of a dissenting meeting house was tricked into lining out the popularBallad of Chevy Chase, rather than the intended hymn. The same tale was more colourfully, and independently, recorded by composer William Gardiner (1770-1853) in his memoir Music and Friends (1836)."]}]}}
