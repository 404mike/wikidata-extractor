Within the next 10 years, they twice won both the Provincial Towns\u00b7 Cup and the Junior Challenge Cup, and even competed, albeit with little success, in the Senior Challenge Cup. The Post War Era at the end of the Second World War, the Club reformed, and were now playing at the Showgrounds, using the changing facilities provided by Ballymena Academy, whose Headmaster, the late W.H. Mol, had taken over the position of Club President. Ballymena a Senior Club After a number of successful years, which produced successive Junior League Championship wins in 1950\u201351 and 1951\u201352, an application was made to the Ulster Branch for admission to the senior ranks, and so, in the 1952\u201353 season, Ballymena became a Senior Club. Two years later, they moved to their present home at Eaton Park, then a modest 9 acres, which they had acquired from the Mid-Antrim Sports Association, and where other sports like Cricket, Tennis, Men's Hockey and later Athletics, were being catered for. Only the first of these has survived, and continues to flourish as a very successful and thriving Section of the Club. The following couple of decades saw Eaton Park expand to 30-odd acres, and the erection of a pavilion, a function hall, training floodlights, a grandstand and a clubhouse with kitchen facilities. Success After acquiring senior status in 1952, Ballymena had to wait ten years for their next playing success, winning the Senior Cup in 1962\u201363, benefiting from the leadership and superb place-kicking of captain Jonathan Moffett. This was followed by a number of lean years, which, however, still produced Internationals like Syd Millar, a past-President of the I.R.F.U., and a past-Chairman of the International Rugby Board, Barton McCallan and the legendary W.J. McBride.", "* Syd Millar", "* Syd Millar: 1962, 1968"]}, {"page": "2003 Rugby World Cup Final", "response": ["England became the first nation from the Northern Hemisphere to win the Rugby World Cup, ending 16 years of Southern Hemisphere dominance in the competition. IRB chairman Syd Millar presented the runners-up medals to the losing Australian side. The victorious England team received their winning medals from John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, before Johnson held aloft the Webb Ellis Cup presented to him by Howard. Afterwards, the England team took a lap of honour around the stadium. Wilkinson was named man of the match, and was voted the first rugby recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, with Johnson placing second. Every member of England's playing and senior coaching staff were honoured within the Order of the British Empire in the 2004 New Year Honours. In May 2004, the England squad were named the winners of the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year for their triumph."]}]}}
