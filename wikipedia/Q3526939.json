He took five wickets in the match: 3\u201380 in the first innings and 2\u201356 in the second, including the key wicket of Gary Kirsten (for 130 and 60) in both innings. Nonetheless, England were soundly beaten and the selectors rang the changes, bringing in Steve Harmison and Ashley Giles for Kabir and James Kirtley. The Headingley match was Kabir's solitary Test appearance, although he made a number of further appearances at ODI level. His greatest success came against South Africa in 2004/05, when he took more wickets (13) than any other England bowler, and at Bloemfontein somehow conjured a tie from nowhere."]}, {"page": "Twenty20 in England in 2005", "response": ["Surrey Lions were consistently pegged back by the Sussex Sharks' bowling at The Oval, having been put in to bat by Sussex captain Chris Adams.

However, when Anderson was ruled out with a knee injury, Johnson cancelled his honeymoon and an injury to Steve Harmison in the first Test saw him selected for the second.  He responded by becoming the first English bowler since Nick Cook in 1983 to take five-wicket hauls in his first two Tests.  He finished with match figures of 9/93, and was once again rewarded by being named man of the match.  In the subsequent ODIs, Johnson claimed three wickets in the second match after remaining wicket-less in the first.  Johnson's third, and final, Test appearance came in the first Test against Sri Lanka in December 2003.  He claimed a solitary wicket, that of Kumar Sangakkara.
