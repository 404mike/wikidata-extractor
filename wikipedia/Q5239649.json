He also presented nature programmes on the BBC's Children's Hour under the name \"The Zoo Man\", and also \"Friends from the Zoo\" on BBC Television in the 1930s. He illustrated and photographed many animals and birds in captivity and is credited for taking the only known photographs of the now extinct pink-headed duck.By 1945, he was a Fellow of the Royal Zoological Society; Member of the British Ornithologists' Union; Hon. Fellow, New York Zoological Society; Corresponding Fellow, American Ornithologists' Union; and Corresponding Member, Societe National d'Acclimatation de France.His grandfather was Seth Smith (property developer), who built large proportions of Mayfair & Belgravia in the West End, and his half brother, William Howard Seth-Smith III was a noted architect.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Children's Hour", "response": ["In the United Kingdom, Children's Hour was broadcast from 5\u00a0pm to 6\u00a0pmStrictly speaking: 5\u00a0pm to 5.55. The last five minutes were assigned to the Weather Forecast  every day of the week, with the biggest listening figures being at weekends when parents joined in too. It was the time of day during the week when children could be expected to be home from school, and was aimed at an audience aged about 5 to 15 years.  Programming was imbued with Reithian virtues, and Children's Hour was often criticised, like \"Auntie\" BBC itself, for paternalism and middle-class values. It was nonetheless hugely popular, and its presenters were national figures, their voices instantly recognisable.  Derek McCulloch was closely involved with the programme from 1926, and ran the department from 1933 until 1950, when he had to resign for health reasons. From 1928 to 1960, Children's Hour in Scotland was organised and presented by Kathleen Garscadden, known as Auntie Kathleen, whose popularity brought crowds to the radio station in Glasgow.W. H. McDowell, \u2018Garscadden, Kathleen Mary Evelyn (1897\u20131991)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009  Popular nature study programmes on Children's Hour were presented by George Bramwell Evens ('Romany of the BBC'), Norman Ellison ('Nomad of the BBC') and David Seth-Smith (the 'Zoo Man of the BBC') in England and Wales during the 1930s, 40s and 50s.  On Scottish Children's Hour their equivalents were Gilbert Dempster Fisher (the 'Hut Man of the BBC'), James Douglas-Home (the 'Bird Man'), and Thomas Haining Gillespie (known later as the 'Zoo Man of the Scottish BBC').", "*David Seth-Smith, aka The Zoo Man"]}, {"page": "Pink-headed duck", "response": ["The reason for its disappearance was probably habitat destruction. It is not known why it was always considered rare, but the rarity is believed to be genuine (and not an artefact of insufficient fieldwork) as its erstwhile habitat was frequently scoured by hunters in Colonial times. The pink-headed duck was much sought after by hunters and later as an ornamental bird, mainly because of its unusual plumage. Like most diving ducks, it was not considered good eating, which should facilitate the survival of any remnant birds. The last specimen was obtained in 1935 in Darbhanga, Bihar, India by C. M. Inglis. Some birds were also kept in the aviaries of Jean Th\u00e9odore Delacour in Cl\u00e8res (France) and Alfred Ezra at Foxwarren Park (England) where the last known birds lived in captivity. The only known photographs of the species were taken here and include one of a pair taken around 1925 by David Seth-Smith."]}, {"page": "D.

His contributions to these Children's Hour programmes began in 1926 when they were broadcast by the Edinburgh and Glasgow stations of the BBC. He was, in those early years, probably not billed as 'the Zoo Man' of the BBC - that title, for English stations at least, was given to David Seth-Smith who broadcast on Children's Hour and published books as 'Zoo Man of the BBC' in the 1930s. Gillespie's early books did not include the Zoo man nickname. However Gillespie was, by the late 1950s, being described as the 'Zoo man of the Scottish BBC' and he published books under that name from 1960 onwards.As is evidenced by the issues of the Radio Times for the period. His early radio talks were published in a series of 'Zoo Tales' books which are listed below. He appears in a group photograph with Garscadden, the 'Bird Man of the BBC' (James Douglas-Home), and the 'Hut Man of the BBC' (Gilbert D. Fisher). He is referred to as 'Tom H. Gillespie' in reference to this group photograph."]}, {"page": "Silver Medal (Zoological Society of London)", "response": ["| 1908 || David Seth-Smith & William Ingram"]}, {"page": "Seth Smith (property developer)", "response": ["One of his grandsons was David Seth-Smith, who was a well known zoologist, and another, William Howard Seth-Smith III, who was a noted architect."]}, {"page": "Seth (surname)", "response": ["* David Seth-Smith (1875\u20131963), British zoologist, wildlife artist and broadcaster "]}, {"page": "Seth-Smith, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Seth-Smith"]}]}}
