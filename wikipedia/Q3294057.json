A freak injury to reserve goalkeeper Saul Deeney (who was ruled out for six weeks after twisting his ankle when slipping over in the rain after an unplanned fire drill at the hotel the team were staying at prior to the 1\u20130 defeat at Swansea) heightened the need for a goalkeeper, and Clough was again linked with a move for frequent target, Blackburn Rover's Frank Fielding, though the move was knocked back by Blackburn. Mark Dudley and Gary Mills were loaned out to Hinckley United and Solihull Moors respectively whilst both Jermaine Johnson and Henrik Ojamaa made one-month loan moves to Stafford Rangers. Young Serbian striker Aleksandar Prijovi\u0107 joined OB Odense on trial, where he impressed with a goal in a trial match. Of Prijovi\u0107, Derby boss Nigel Clough said \"They are very interested in taking him in January so we are just trying to get a deal done if they want to do one. If not, we will probably look to get him out on loan. If we can do it before the deadline, we will do. If not, in January.\" Fellow striker Luke Varney, away on loan at Sheffield Wednesday was also linked with a permanent move away, though Wednesday boss Brian Laws stated  \"We're in discussions with Derby, we spoke to them on Tuesday, we've still got to have discussions about what they want to do with the player, bearing in mind he's got two and a bit years left on his contract.

There was also a \u00a3200k move for Millwall's David Martin which collapsed at the last moment, though Nigel Clough intimated the move may be resurrected as a loan when the Emergency Loan window opened, and it was eventually completed with Martin joining on a season long loan on 9 February 2010.
