In 1872 he published a list of 800 Norfolk fungi in the Transactions of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists' Society and was elected an honorary member. Starting in 1873, Plowright published a series of fasciculi (pamphlets intended to be collected into a book) titled Sphaeriacei Britannici describing members of the fungal genus Sphaeria (species modernly placed in Pseudovalsa, Macrospora, Homostegia, and others). With his collaborator William Phillips, Plowright published a series of papers titled New and Rare British Fungi (1871\u20131884) which described almost 300 new species. Plowright contributed to The Gardeners' Chronicle for over thirty years, writing principally on fungal diseases of plants; he was an early advocate in England of the use of Bordeaux mixture. Early in his career he made a special collection of Pyrenomycetae (now Sordariomycetes) and published several papers on them; he later moved on to the Uredinaceae, in 1889 publishing A Monograph of the British Uredinaea and Ustilaginaea. He was one of the early organizers of the British Mycological Society and served as president in 1898\u20139."]}, {"page": "William Phillips (mycologist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Phillips (botanist)"]}, {"page": "W.Phillips", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Phillips (botanist)"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (W\u2013Z)", "response": ["* W.Phillips \u2013 William Phillips (botanist) (1822\u20131905)"]}]}}
