It took time for a distinctly New Zealand literature to develop. The first printing press arrived in New Zealand in 1834, and the first book printed was a M\u0101ori translation of a catechism in 1830 by William Yate, Ko Te Katikihama III. Early New Zealand books were generally narratives of visits and travel to New Zealand, such as A Narrative of a Nine Months' Residence in New Zealand in 1827 (1832) by Augustus Earle or Station Life in New Zealand (1870) by Mary Anne Barker, or scientific works such as The New Zealanders Illustrated, a rare book by natural history artist George French Angas (1847) and A History of the Birds of New Zealand (1872) by ornithologist Walter Buller. Early expressions of New Zealand identity in literature included, notably, Old New Zealand by \"a Pakeha Maori\" (Frederick Edward Maning) and Erewhon by Samuel Butler, which drew on the author's experiences of living in Canterbury for five years."]}, {"page": "Frederick Broome", "response": ["The eldest son of Rev.
