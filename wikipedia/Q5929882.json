The traditional story is that sheriff Melville had made himself very unpopular with the local lairds by too strict an adherence to his jurisdiction. The Duke of Albany at the time was also Regent of Scotland while James I of Scotland was in captivity in England. The Duke is alleged to have become tired of endless complaints about Melville and exclaimed \"sorrow gin that sheriff were sodden and supped in broo\", which was taken by the disgruntled lairds as a signal to kill the sheriff. The Lairds of Arbuthnott, Mathers, Pitarrow and Halkerton invited Melville to a hunting party in the Garvock Forest. However Melville was lured to a prearranged place where he was killed by being thrown into a cauldron of boiling water and each of the murderers took a spoonful of the murderous brew. The Laird of Arbuthnott was pardoned for his involvement in this affair and died peacefully in 1446."]}, {"page": "Kincardineshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\" | Sir Hugh Arbuthnot || Tory"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Kincardineshire||Hon.
