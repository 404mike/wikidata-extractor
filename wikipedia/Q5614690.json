Lawrence D'Orsay, Maxwell-Conover, and Evelyn Carter were among the actors in a show which was presented twice daily except for Sunday. The farce tells about a group of social climbers who try to persuade an English nobleman to assist them in their activities. In April 1915 Conover-Maxwell was in a production of The Natural Law by Charles Sumner at the Republic Theatre, at 209 West 42nd Street, in midtown Manhattan. The play changed venues in September 1915. It moved to the York Theatre at 116th Street near Lenox Avenue. John Cort had recently added the York to his chain of playhouses which offered Broadway attractions to audiences at \"popular\" prices. Conrad Nagel was in the cast when the play came to the Loew's Lexington Theatre, 571 Lexington Avenue in October."]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1915", "response": ["| The Earl of Pawtucket || Harry Myers || Lawrence D'Orsay, Rosemary Theby || Comedy || Universal"]}, {"page": "D'Orsay (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Lawrence D'Orsay (1853\u20131931), British film actor"]}, {"page": "His Children's Children", "response": ["*Lawrence D'Orsay as Mr. Pepperill"]}, {"page": "Miss Bluebeard", "response": ["*Lawrence D'Orsay as Colonel Harding"]}, {"page": "Ruggles of Red Gap (1918 film)", "response": ["*Lawrence D'Orsay as Honorable George Vane-Basingwell"]}, {"page": "D'Orsay, Lawrence", "response": ["#redirectLawrence D'Orsay"]}, {"page": "The Bond Boy", "response": ["*Lawrence D'Orsay as Colonel Price"]}, {"page": "Lawrance D'Orsay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lawrence D'Orsay "]}]}}
