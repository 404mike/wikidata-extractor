Twelve-year-old Emilie Fran\u00e7ois, appearing as Margaret Dashwood, was one of the last people cast in the production; she had no professional acting experience. Thompson praised the young actress in her production diaries, \"Emilie has a natural quick intelligence that informs every movement \u2013 she creates spontaneity in all of us just by being there.\" Other cast members included Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood, James Fleet as John Dashwood, Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, Imogen Stubbs as Lucy Steele, Richard Lumsden as Robert Ferrars, Tom Wilkinson as Mr. Dashwood, and Lone Vidahl as Miss Grey."]}, {"page": "Edith Wharton", "response": ["*The Buccaneers, a 1995 BBC mini-series, starring Carla Gugino and Greg Wise"]}, {"page": "Emma Thompson", "response": ["Thompson is married to actor Greg Wise, with whom she lives in London. They have one daughter and an adopted son. She is an activist in the areas of human rights and environmentalism. She has written two books adapted from The Tale of Peter Rabbit.", "The period drama Effie Gray, a project that she had been working on for many years, based on the true-life story of John Ruskin's disastrous marriage, was written by Thompson but became the subject of a copyright suit before being cleared for cinemas. The American playwright Gregory Murphy said that Thompson's screenplay was an infringement on his play and screenplay The Countess, which he claimed he had submitted to Thompson through a mutual friend in 2003 to consider the role of Elizabeth Eastlake in a proposed film of his play, and to Thompson's husband Greg Wise through a casting director to consider the role of John Ruskin in the play's 2005 West End production. In 2008, Thompson announced that she and Wise \"had written a script together about John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic, which we want to make into a film.\" After meeting with Thompson and her producers, Potboiler Productions, Murphy was offered a screenwriting fee and co-screenwriting credit with Thompson in settlement of his claim. This settlement offer was later abandoned by Thompson, Greg Wise and their partner Donald Rosenfeld, when their company Sovereign Films took over production of the film and instigated the suit, creating the independent entity Effie Film, LLC, spearheaded by Rosenfeld, to litigate it.  In March 2013, District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa, after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence from which Murphy claimed \"some of the most troubling material\" had been removed, ruled that while there were similarities, the screenplays were \"quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalising the same historical events\". In response to Murphy's attorney's concerns that the completed film Effie Gray would not adhere to Thompson's second revised screenplay, Judge Griesa concluded his ruling by saying that Thompson's film would not infringe Murphy's play or screenplay \"only to the extent that it does not substantially deviate from the November 29, 2011 screenplay,\" the date of Thompson's second revised screenplay. In May 2013, Effie Gray's Cannes Film Festival premiere was cancelled. In October 2013, the film was withdrawn from the Mill Valley Film Festival in California due to \"unforeseen circumstances\" according to producer Rosenfeld. In December 2013, Thompson said of the still unreleased Effie Gray that its \"time has probably passed,\" comparing it to another project of hers that \"didn't happen either\". Effie Gray was released in October 2014, to a modest reception. Thompson plays Elizabeth Eastlake and Greg Wise plays John Ruskin. They both declined to promote the film. Camilla Long, reviewing Effie Gray in The Sunday Times, wrote \"nothing fits together\" and \"no one seems to know why they made this film. Where is Thompson's passion and commitment, or any hint of what she intended to achieve.\" Manohla Dargis in her review in The New York Times called Effie Gray \"The cinematic equivalent of a Brazilian wax, the movie omits much of the story's most interesting material to create something that's been smoothly denatured.\"", "In 2019, Thompson starred in a leading role in Late Night, which was written by Mindy Kaling (who also co-starred in that film) and featured her as a popular television host who hires a new writer to keep the show from getting replaced. The film received positive reviews, with Thompson being singled out for praise, and Owen Gleiberman of Variety remarked that \"Thompson truly seems like a born talk-show host. Even when she's just riffing, she grounds Late Night in something real.\" For her performance, Thompson was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical (her third nomination in that category) at the 77th Golden Globe Awards. In the same year, she voiced as the Yeti Elder in the stop-motion animated film Missing Link, reprised her role as Agent O in a more substantial part in Men in Black: International, and co-produced and co-starred alongside Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding in the festive romantic comedy Last Christmas, which was based on the song of the same name by George Michael, and was written by Thompson, her husband Greg Wise, and Bryony Kimmings.", "Thompson was living alone as the relationship with Branagh deteriorated, and became depressed. While filming Sense and Sensibility in 1995, she began a relationship with her co-star Greg Wise. Commenting on how she was able to overcome her depression, she told BBC Radio 4, \"Work saved me and Greg saved me. He picked up the pieces and put them together again.\" The couple have a daughter, Gaia, a pregnancy achieved via in vitro fertilisation when Thompson was 39."]}, {"page": "2003 in film", "response": ["| Johnny English || Universal Pictures / StudioCanal / Working Title Films || Peter Howitt (director); Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, William Davies (screenplay); Rowan Atkinson, John Malkovich, Ben Miller, Natalie Imbruglia, Oliver Ford Davies, Tim Pigott-Smith, Kevin McNally, Douglas McFerran, Steve Nicolson, Greg Wise, Tim Berrington, Prunella Scales, Tasha de Vasconcelos, Nina Young, Sam Beazley, Jenny Galloway, Chris Tarrant, Trevor McDonald || Comedy || || Live Action"]}, {"page": "1995 in film", "response": ["| Sense and Sensibility || Columbia Pictures || Ang Lee (director); Emma Thompson (screenplay); Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Imogen Stubbs, Greg Wise, Gemma Jones, Harriet Walter, James Fleet, Hugh Laurie, Imelda Staunton, Robert Hardy, Elisabeth Spriggs, Tom Wilkinson || Period, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| House of Frankenstein || NBC / Studios USA Television / Universal Television Entertainment || Peter Werner (director); J.B.
