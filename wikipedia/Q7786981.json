Beck was a long-term resident of Hawkshead in  Lancashire, where his parents had lived at The Grove. He was to use a wheelchair for much of his life, being unable to walk due to a spinal complaint. At one time he had attended Hawkshead Grammar School and he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1814, but left without taking a degree. Around 1819 he commenced the building of his regency mansion, Esthwaite Lodge (subsequently a youth hostel), to the design of George Webster. The grounds were specially laid out with easy gradients for his invalid chair. Besides other antiquarian interests, he also edited Dr. William Close's unfinished work An Itinerary of Furness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Beck", "response": ["* Thomas Alcock Beck (1795\u20131846), English historian"]}, {"page": "Hawkshead Grammar School", "response": ["* Thomas Alcock Beck"]}, {"page": "Thomas Alcock", "response": ["*Thomas Alcock Beck (1795\u20131846), author"]}, {"page": "List of works by George Webster", "response": ["|Attributed to Francis and George Webster, with its Doric porch it is described as a \"Grecian doll's house\".
