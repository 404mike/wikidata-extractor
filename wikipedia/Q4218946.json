Cave was one of the most prolific contributors to pulp magazines of the 1920s and '30s, selling an estimated 800 stories not only in the aforementioned genres but also in western, fantasy, adventure, crime, romance and non-fiction. He used a variety of pen names, notably Justin Case under which name he created the antihero The Eel. A war correspondent during World War II, Cave afterwards settled in Jamaica where he owned and managed a coffee plantation and continued his writing career, now specializing in novels as well as fiction and non-fiction sales to mainstream magazines.\nStarting in the 1970s Cave enjoyed a resurgence in popularity when Karl Edward Wagner's Carcosa Press published Murgunstrumm and Others, the first hardcover collection of Cave's pulp stories. Cave relocated to Florida and regularly published original material until about the year 2000, and won a World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 1999.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pulp magazine", "response": ["The collapse of the pulp industry changed the landscape of publishing because pulps were the single largest sales outlet for short stories. Combined with the decrease in slick magazine fiction markets, writers attempting to support themselves by creating fiction switched to novels and book-length anthologies of shorter pieces. Some ex-pulp writers like Hugh B. Cave and Robert Leslie Bellem moved on to writing for television by the 1950s.", "In 1991, The Pulpster debuted at that year's Pulpcon, the annual pulp magazine convention that had begun in 1972. The magazine, devoted to the history and legacy of the pulp magazines, has published each year since. It now appears in connection with PulpFest, the summer pulp convention that grew out of and replaced Pulpcon. The Pulpster was originally edited by Tony Davis and is currently edited by William Lampkin, who also runs the website ThePulp.Net. Contributors have included Don Hutchison, Robert Sampson, Will Murray, Al Tonik, Nick Carr, Mike Resnick, Hugh B. Cave, Joseph Wrzos, Jessica Amanda Salmonson, Chet Williamson, and many others.

Cave, went on to greater commercial and critical success. Writer George Harmon Coxe created \"Casey, Crime Photographer\", for the magazine; the character became a media franchise, appearing in novels, films, radio and television programs, comic books, and theatrical productions."]}, {"page": "Weird Tales", "response": ["Quinn was Weird Tales' most prolific author, with a long-running sequence of stories about a detective, Jules de Grandin, who investigated supernatural events, and for a while he was the most popular writer in the magazine.  Other regular contributors included Paul Ernst, David H. Keller, Greye La Spina, Hugh B. Cave, and Frank Owen, who wrote fantasies set in an imaginary version of the Far East.  C.L. Moore's  story \"Shambleau\", her first sale, appeared in Weird Tales in November 1933; Price visited the Weird Tales offices shortly after Wright read the manuscript for it, and recalls that Wright was so enthusiastic about the story that he closed the office, declaring it \"C.L. Moore day\".Weinberg (1999b), p. 37.  The story was very well received by readers, and Moore's work, including her stories about Jirel of Joiry and Northwest Smith, appeared almost exclusively in Weird Tales over the next three years.Dziemianowicz (1997), p. 661.thumb|Illustration by Virgil Finlay for Tennyson's \"The Princess\", from the October 1938 issue|alt=Several naked elves cavort on a cliff topAs well as fiction, Wright printed a substantial amount of poetry, with at least one poem included in most issues.  Originally this often included reprints of poems such as Edgar Allan Poe's \"El Dorado\", but soon most of the poetry was original, with contributions coming from Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith, among many others.Weinberg (1983), p. 2451.  Lovecraft's contributions included ten of his \"Fungi from Yuggoth\" poems, a series of sonnets on weird themes that he wrote in 1930.de Camp (1975), p. 317.", "Weird Tales included a letters column, titled \"The Eyrie\", for most of its existence, and during Wright's time as editor it was usually filled with long and detailed letters.  When Brundage's nude covers appeared, a lengthy debate over whether they were suitable for the magazine was fought out in the Eyrie, with the two sides divided about equally.  For years it was the most discussed topic in the magazine's letter column.  Many of the authors Wright published wrote letters too, including Lovecraft, Howard, Kuttner, Bloch, Smith, Quinn,  Wellman, Price, and Wandrei. In most cases these letters praised the magazine, but occasionally a critical comment was raised, as when Bloch repeatedly expressed his dislike for Howard's stories of Conan the Barbarian, referring to him as \"Conan the Cimmerian Chipmunk\".Weinberg (1999e), pp. 122\u2013124.  Another debate that was aired in the letter column was the question of how much science fiction the magazine should include.  Until Amazing Stories was launched in April 1926, science fiction was popular with Weird Tales' readers, but after that point letters began to appear asking Wright to exclude science fiction, and only publish weird fantasy and horror.  The pro-science fiction readers were in the majority, and as Wright agreed with them, he continued to include science fiction in Weird Tales.Weinberg (1999e), p. 120.  Hugh B. Cave, who sold half-a-dozen stories to Wright in the early 1930s, commented on \"The Eyrie\" in a letter to a fellow writer: \"No other magazine makes such a point of discussing past stories, and letting the authors know how their stuff is received\".Letter, undated, but \"apparently early 1932\" according to Cave, quoted in Cave (1994), p. 14."]}]}}
