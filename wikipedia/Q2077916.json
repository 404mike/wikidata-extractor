Two occasions on which he officiated during key matches were the World Championship finals between Stephen Hendry and Mark Williams in 1999 and the match between Peter Ebdon and Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2005 (the so-called \"slow-play\" match).\nBrinded died after a short battle with cancer. In BBC2's coverage of the UK Championship on 9 December 2005, tributes came from fellow referee Eirian Williams; veteran commentator and journalist Clive Everton; and from players John Parrott, Stephen Hendry and then-reigning World Champion Shaun Murphy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in November 2005", "response": ["*Colin Brinded, 59, British snooker referee, cancer."]}, {"page": "1997 World Snooker Championship", "response": ["* Alan Chamberlain refereed his first and only World Championship final.

White won the first frame with a 54 break, but a fluke on a red ball in the second gave Hendry the impetus to win the next two frames with breaks of 97 and 75. White took the fourth frame to equalise the scoreline, until Hendry made his 632nd career century break (102) to win the fifth. White then made a clearance of 40, after Hendry missed a shot on the pink ball to a middle pocket in frame six, and White took the lead. A 36 clearance and a 51 break won him the match, his first against Hendry at the Wembley Conference Centre in seven attempts. After the match, White apologised to Hendry for the crowd's disrespectful behaviour; a female spectator had been ejected and escorted out of the arena by security after she ignored repeated warnings over disrupting the match. White also voiced a complaint about the playing conditions, and the WPBSA conducted a meticulous investigation of the table's mechanics on 4 February, to correct any imperfections prior to the start of the quarter-finals."]}, {"page": "List of snooker referees", "response": ["*  Colin Brinded"]}, {"page": "2005 Welsh Open (snooker)", "response": ["| colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffd700\" | Final: Best of 17 frames.
