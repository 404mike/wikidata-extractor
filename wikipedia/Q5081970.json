He based this analysis on over one hundred games at all levels, including games involving Liverpool and the Brazilian national team, as well as many England youth games. His ideals were developed from those previously developed by World War II Wing Commander Charles Reep. From his statistical analysis, Hughes emphasised the importance of particular areas of the field from where goals were most often scored. He called these areas the 'POMO' \u2013 Positions Of Maximum Opportunity \u2013 and asserted that players would score if the ball was played into the 'POMO' enough times. He stressed the importance of set plays and crosses into the penalty area."]}, {"page": "Jackie Gibbons", "response": ["Gibbons became manager of Second Division club Brentford in February 1949, taking over from Harry Curtis, the most successful manager in the club's history.
