A wine-tasting panel often featured along with items on flower-arranging, pets and gardening, the latter involving Titchmarsh answering viewer's horticultural questions assisted by studio guests. The show usually concluded with Titchmarsh interviewing a major celebrity or public figure and also contained regular musical items with live studio performances.
