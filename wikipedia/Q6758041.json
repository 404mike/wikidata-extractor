Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with \"flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes\".

The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in bronzed lattice. On the walls are a series lamp holders held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each bulb holder containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on \"cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels\".  The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, in contrast to the window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by \"clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding\", according to Binney."]}, {"page": "Piercefield House", "response": ["The estate was put up for sale in October 2005 with Jackson-Stops for an asking price of \u00a32 million.
