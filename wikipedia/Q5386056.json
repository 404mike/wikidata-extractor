Under Pick, Holden's attention to detail and idea of integrated design extended to all parts of London's transport network, from designing bus and tram shelters to a new type of six-wheeled omnibus. In the late 1930s, Holden designed replacement stations at Highgate, East Finchley and Finchley Central and new stations at Elstree South and Bushey Heath for the Northern line's Northern Heights plan. Holden's designs incorporated sculpture relevant to the local history of a number of stations: Dick Whittington for Highgate, a Roman centurion at Elstree South and an archer for East Finchley. Much of the project was postponed shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and was later cancelled. Only East Finchley station was completed in full with Highgate in part; the other plans were scrapped. East Finchley station is located on an embankment and the platforms are accessed from below. Making use of the station's air-rights, Holden provided staff office space spanning above the tracks accessed through semi-circular glazed stairways from the platforms. Eric Aumonier provided the statue The Archer, a prominent feature of the station."]}, {"page": "1940 in art", "response": ["* Eric Aumonier \u2013 The Archer (East Finchley tube station, London Passenger Transport Board)"]}, {"page": "East Finchley tube station", "response": ["A strong feature of the station is the semi-circular glazed stairways leading to the enclosed bridge over the tracks occupied by staff offices.

J. Mallinson DL on 12 May 1934. It was designed by Robert Atkinson in the Georgian style, built by Perry (Ealing) Ltd and was officially opened by the Member of Parliament for Mitcham, Sir Richard Meller, on 21 September 1934. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with eleven bays facing onto Woodcote Road; the central section of five bays featured a three-bay porch with fluted pilasters; there was a central window and balcony with wrought-iron railings on the first floor with the borough coat of arms carved by the sculptor, Eric Aumonier, above; there was a copper-clad clock tower with a weather vane at roof level. The clock was designed and manufactured by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon. The landscaping around the building incorporated a garden of remembrance and a flagpole, which was erected in a prominent position in front of the building. The principal room was a double-height council chamber; the interior made extensive use of walnut paneling and the double-flight staircase, which was made from black and white marble, was decorated in an art deco style. Pevsner noted that the \"romanticism of Sweden and Holland in the 1920s is represented, surprisingly prettily and pleasantly, by Wallington Town Hall\"."]}]}}
