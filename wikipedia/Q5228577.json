The Guardian recommended Ken alongside Ryu for beginners in Street Fighter IV with Ken being better at close-up fights as a result of his powerful uppercuts. In a humor article by GameSpy, the Super Street Fighter II Turbo version of Ken was mentioned to have become unbalanced to the point he was the strongest character from the cast. In Street Fighter III: Third Strike, Ken was also noted to be one of the three more powerful characters from the game alongside Chun-Li and Yun. Similarly, Dave Cook from Now Gamer called him and Tekkens Eddy Gordo one of the most hated characters from their franchises due to their overpowered moves. In another article, Cook listed a fight between Ken and Eddy Gordo as one of the fights he wished to see in Street Fighter X Tekken calling it the \"ultimate battle of super cheapness.\" UGO Networks placed Ken at #4 on their list of \"Top 50 Street Fighter Characters\", stating \"If you're a fan of dragon punches, you play Ken.\". Jeremy Parish of Polygon ranked 73 fighters from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate \"from garbage to glorious\", listing Ken as 62th."]}, {"page": "Sakura Kasugano", "response": ["However, the character has received some negative criticism in the West. By 2000, New Zealand Station noted how \"evolution of game babes can plough into dangerous new territory, such as Capcom's pivotal female icon changing from the wholesome and strong-willed Chun Li into the cute but undeniably underaged Sakura (though curiously, the Japanese age of consent is 13).\" GameDaily listed her under \"hot, but annoying\", questioning her about always following Ryu and wanting him to fight her as she is \"either an innocent fan or a psycho.\" In 2010, Play included Sakura's schoolgirl costume among the top inappropriate outfits due to her exposure in fights. That same year, Dave Cook from Now Gamer listed a fight between Sakura and Ling Xiaoyu as one of the fights he wished to see in Street Fighter X Tekken, opining that as while the two shared unsuitable outfits, the two are entertaining in terms of gameplay.

The Escapist described Juri as \"jarring\", praising Capcom for trying to take risks with the character design but at the same time questioning how well the character meshes with Street Fighter IVs main cast. In describing Juri, IGN editor Martin Robinson called her \"quite awesome\" and \"SSFIVs best. IGN editor Ryan Clements stated that he was most excited to try out Juri, attributing this to his \"recent fascination with K-pop.\" He called her an \"excellent addition to the roster\" after playing a few rounds with her. Street Fighter player Justin Wong described her as \"very unique\", comparing her to Fatal Fury character Kim Kaphwan. GameSpot editor Ricardo Torres similarly compared her to Kim Kaphwan, also comparing her to fellow Street Fighter characters Rose and M. Bison. He also described her as an \"amazingly flexible and sensibly dressed vixen.\" G4TV editor Matt Keil called her Taekwondo-inspired play style \"fascinating,\" calling it \"almost reminiscent of a King of Fighters character.\" Game Informer editor Dan Ryckert called Juri his \"personal favorite,\" citing her fighting style. GamesRadar Michael Grimm chose Alisa Bosconovitch from the Tekken series as an opponent he would like to see Juri battle, commenting that Juri may be at a disadvantage since Alisa is an android and Juri a human. On the other hand, Dave Cook from Now Gamer listed Hwoarang as the opponent he wanted Juri to face as both have similar traits such as being Tae Kwon Do kickboxers. GamePro editor Heidi Kemps commented that \"after spending time with her, I think I've found my new favorite Street Fighter IV character.\" GameDaily editor Chris Buffa described Juri as a \"wonderful addition.\" Similarly, GameZone editor Dakota Grabowski gave \"much love\" to the addition of Juri to the Street Fighter universe. Hardcore Gamer editor Nicholas J. Martin praised Juri for bringing a \"unique mix\" to the series. UGO Networks placed Juri at #13 on their list of Top 50 Street Fighter Characters\", stating \"Juri is a fast and agile cyberneticaly enhanced fighter and during the course of Super Street Fighter IV\". 1UP.com listed Juri as one of the characters they wanted to see in Street Fighter X Tekken, adding \"Juri is arguably one of Capcom's best fighting games character designs to date and I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to see her in more games\". Complex ranked Juri as the \"31st-most dominant fighting game character\", stating \"The Juri equation is simply Taekwondo + extra perverted creepiness + dat eye = Purple Swag Madness!\" WhatCulture ranked Juri as the \"10th-greatest female fighting game character of all time\", commenting, \"Arguably the greatest new addition to the Street Fighter family with the release of IV, Juri's leg-centric combat style fused with some handy psycho powers courtesy of M.

They described the song as \"an acid electro funk song\". It is written by Jun Gandi and composed by Hyuk Shin, Jordan Kyle, Ross Lara, Dave Cook, DK, and Anthony \"TC\" Crawford. The song has a fuller sound, featuring electric guitars among various other synths and the beat is very diverse and complex with a lot of tempo changes. The song is described as the most \"Shinee-like song\" in the album and tells about how the five boys meet their dream girl that only appears in their dreams, and disappears in reality. The accompanying music video was filmed in January 2013, with choreography by Tony Testa. The song peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart and number three on the Korea K-Pop Hot 100. The music video to the single was released on February 19, 2013 and features the members of the group doing unique tricks with mic stands that are noted to be the highlight of the dance routine. It's full of color and modern flair. The music video is the work of Digipedi, a South Korean video production company formed and led by the duo Seong Won-mo and Park Sang-woo."]}]}}
