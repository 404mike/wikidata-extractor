The following season Cardiff went one better finishing in second place, thus gaining promotion to the First Division. During Cardiff's promotion season Grant was top scorer with 26 goals, the first 19 of which were at home. Shortly after Cardiff secured their place in the top flight, Grant's superb form earned him a call up to the England 'B' team for a match against their French equivalents on 22 May 1952. Unfortunately for Grant the match ended in a resounding 7\u20131 victory for the French which brought his international career to an end."]}, {"page": "Brian Walsh (English footballer)", "response": ["Walsh began his career playing non-league football before joining Arsenal as an amateur in March 1949 before signing professional for the club five months later.

(1899\u20131962)", "response": ["Following the return of the Football League Cardiff chairman Sir Herbert Merrett established close links with Torquay United after being a regular visitor to a hotel owned by the Torquay chairman. The arrangement saw any players Cardiff thought not good enough would be offered to Torquay and Cardiff would get first refusal on any players who were thought good enough to make it in higher leagues. A number of players joined Cardiff from Torquay, the most successful being goalkeeper Phil Joslin, winger Mike Tiddy and forward Tommy Northcott. However the relationship became sour after Cardiff allowed Harry Parfitt to join the Devon based side in the understanding they could have him back when required. In 1954 Cardiff offered \u00a32500 to bring him back but Torquay demanded \u00a35000. Despite the Torquay chairman willing to let him return to Cardiff for \u00a32500 several members of the club's board decided to block the move until a higher price was agreed. Cardiff eventually paid the \u00a35000 asking price but subsequently broke off ties with Torquay."]}]}}
