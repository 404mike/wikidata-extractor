Edmonds described Rastafari as having \"a fairly cohesive worldview\"; however, the scholar Ernest Cashmore thought that its beliefs were \"fluid and open to interpretation\". Within the movement, attempts to summarise Rastafari belief have never been accorded the status of a catechism or creed. Rastas place great emphasis on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice. No Rasta, therefore, has the authority to declare which beliefs and practices are orthodox and which are heterodox. The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma \"is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma\", according to the sociologist of religion Peter B. Clarke."]}, {"page": "Rajneesh", "response": ["The British professor of religious studies Peter B. Clarke said that most participators felt they had made progress in self-actualisation as defined by American psychologist Abraham Maslow and the human potential movement. He stated that the style of therapy Rajneesh devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, had proved influential among other therapy practitioners and new age groups. Yet Clarke believes that the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was \"neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense\"."]}, {"page": "New religious movement", "response": ["* Arweck, Elisabeth and Peter B.
