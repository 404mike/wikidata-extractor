During his six years there he finished as the top scorer in three of the seasons and established himself as one of the club greats. He was selected to play for the Third Division North representative team in 1956/57. His form there persuaded fellow Welsh side Cardiff City to pay seven thousand pound for his services in 1957.

He had spells at Coventry City, Chester City and Hereford United before moving into non-league football.\nHe made his debut for Wales against Israel in 1958 and was part of the Wales squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden.\nHewitt died at the age of 73 in September 2001.Hewitt was an uncle of Everton coach Andy Holden, who also played for Chester and Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 23", "response": ["*2001 \u2013 Ron Hewitt, Welsh footballer (b. 1928)"]}, {"page": "Flint, Flintshire", "response": ["* Ron Hewitt \u2013 Starred in Wales's only FIFA World Cup finals appearance.", "* Andy Holden \u2013 Former footballer, and nephew of Ron Hewitt."]}, {"page": "Wrexham A.F.C.", "response": ["* Ron Hewitt"]}, {"page": "Hereford United F.C.", "response": ["*  Ron Hewitt"]}, {"page": "Severnside derby", "response": ["|Ron Hewitt(2)"]}, {"page": "Bill Myerscough", "response": ["In March 1962, Myerscough joined Chester, who were destined to finish bottom of the Fourth Division.
