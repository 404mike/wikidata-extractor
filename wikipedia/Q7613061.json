The album was recorded in January 2006 at Presshouse Studio, Colyton, Devon, and was produced by Simon Emmerson and Simon \u2018Mass\u2019 Massey from the Afro Celts, who helped to incorporate elements of traditional African, ambient and electronic dance music with the duo's characteristic folk style. It was the band's first album in twelve years to use a rhythm section.

The album features unofficial third member Miranda Sykes on ten of its twelve tracks.", "The album marks a departure for the band, featuring the usage of bass and percussion, the second time the band had experimented with them\u2013the first being Beat about the Bush (1994). The album incorporates elements of traditional African, ambient and electronic dance music with the duo's characteristic folk style. Steve Knightley noted \"every original song on the CD is a first person narrative or testimonial. Incidents and events are witnessed and recorded and every narrator is a different character. It's really a series of scenes from a cinematic style journey of the West Country.\"Witness liner notes The band's website refers to the album as \"the most innovative\" studio album the duo had recorded to date, noting the album is Show of Hands \"as you've never heard them before\".Witness | Show of Hands One commentary noted that the album \"exemplifies how the digital recording techniques contribute to hybrid musical styles\".http://www6.plymouth.ac.uk/files/extranet/docs/SCI/Yarwoodfolkmusic.pdf Phil Beer of the duo said \"It's cutting and pasting. You can take something from somewhere and put it anywhere else \u2026 so in a chorus of a song if a word sounds funny in one place but fine in another chorus, you cut and paste and see if they dovetail together\". [Emmerson] spent hours and hours and hours agonising over where to lay a bell beat: do we put it there or a nanosecond earlier? Because it matters, it actually matters where it falls\". The album features numerous guest musicians. Miranda Sykes appears on ten of the album's twelve compositions and features in the album photographs, whilst Massey appears on nine of the tracks, where he is mostly responsible for percussion and drum programming.Witness liner notes.", "The album was released on the band's own label Hands on Music on 15 May 2006. The CD version is packaged in a digipak. The duo released two double A-side singles from the album. \"Witness\" and \"If I Needed Someone\" were released together as the first single in 2006, and \"Roots\" was released in 2007 as a double A-side with \"Country Life\" from the band's previous album Country Life. A music video was filmed for \"Roots\" in 2006, showing the duo sing the song in several locations. The version of the song in the music video is slightly remixed. Parts of the music video were filmed at the 33rd Trowbridge Village Pump Festival in July 2006, where the duo played the song twice in a row as they did not have enough footage to use from the song's first performance. The music video also shows the band sing the song near the Eden Project in Cornwall. \"Roots\" became their best-selling single ever,Steve Knightley | Show of Hands and reached number 4 on the HMV Download Chart.

NetRhythms said the album is \"recognisably classic (and classy) Show Of Hands and at the same time something very fresh and boldly different\", noting the album \"proves a particularly impressive entry in the Show Of Hands canon\" and that the production \"sets its own standards and provides an inventive and creative new setting for the Show Of Hands experience we know and love.\"", "Iain Hazlewood of Spiral Earth said \"everything has come together perfectly on this recording,\" noting the production resulted in a \"confident enveloping sound\", that \"the alchemy between [the duo] is in their arrangements, lifting their music away from divides of genre\", and that the \"sense of place was as strong as ever\".
