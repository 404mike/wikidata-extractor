He won three England caps, scoring four goals. Carter won an FA Cup winner's medal with West Bromwich Albion in 1931, also helping the team win promotion to Division One in the same season. In September 1931 he became the first ever Albion player to be sent off at The Hawthorns. He played in the 1935 FA Cup Final when Albion finished as runners-up to Sheffield Wednesday.

The replay at The Valley also ended in a draw (1\u20131), and with extra time unable to separate the teams, a second replay was required at Villa Park, where goals from Joe Carter, Stan Wood and W. G. Richardson gave Albion a 3\u20131 victory. Wood also scored the only goal of the game in round four against Tottenham Hotspur to set up a fifth round tie with First Division Portsmouth, the only top division side that Albion faced en route to Wembley; W. G. Richardson's goal was enough to give Albion a 1\u20130 victory. The quarter-final stage saw Albion paired with local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, whom they had already beaten both home and away during the league season. After a 1\u20131 draw at The Hawthorns,  Albion won the replay at Molineux 2\u20131, thanks to goals from W. G. Richardson and Stan Wood.McOwan p. 228", "In the sixth minute, Bob Gregg headed Jimmy Cringan's free kick past the stranded West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, but the linesman flagged Gregg offside and the goal was disallowed; newspaper reports suggest the decision was incorrect.The Daily Mail match report, reproduced in Thraves, pp.\u00a024\u201325. Albion took the lead after 24 minutes when Joe Carter received the ball from Tommy Glidden and took it almost to the by-line before crossing it. As W. G. Richardson attempted a shot he fell, but Birmingham's Ned Barkas inadvertently touched the ball back to him and away from his goalkeeper, and Richardson was able to recover sufficiently to steer it home. Joe Bradford and Johnny Crosbie both missed good chances for Birmingham before half-time.Matthews (1995), p.\u00a019.", "|Forward ||Joe Carter"]}, {"page": "1935 FA Cup Final", "response": ["West Brom went into the match as favourites even though they were below Wednesday in the table, pundits believing that they had the better forward players with Wally Boyes, W.G. Richardson and Teddy Sandford all having notched over 20 League goals for the season. The two teams had actually met in a League game five days earlier on Easter Monday and drawn 1\u20131 at The Hawthorns. Wednesday went into the match with a full strength squad and fielded the same starting eleven that they had for every round except the third, Ellis Rimmer was their ace in the pack having scored in every round up to the final. West Brom brought back Joe Carter into the team having been absent with a knee injury since the semi-final. Harry Jones being the unlucky player to miss out. In hindsight the decision to play Carter was clearly a gamble and a mistake with no substitutes allowed. Carter was limping after only ten minutes of the match and missed two second half chances which he may have taken if he had been fully fit. Another controversial move by West Brom was the decision to leave out Arthur Gale who had played in all six FA Cup ties leading up to the final that season, scoring four goals from the right wing. Gale was replaced by Tommy Glidden who was effectively shackled by Wednesday's left back Ted Catlin.", "The early stages of the second half saw Ronnie Starling miss a chance and then have another effort cleared off the line. Not to be deterred Starling was prominent in Wednesday re-taking the lead on 70 minutes when his pass released Mark Hooper who beat two men before hitting a shot past Harold Pearson that went in off a post. Within five minutes West Brom were level as a Teddy Sandford shot was deflected into the net off Walt Millership. At this stage West Brom looked the likely winners with some of the Wednesday players arguing amongst themselves as they kicked off. It was during this stage of the game that the limping Joe Carter missed his two good chances, hitting the post with one of them. W. G. Richardson also missed a fine opportunity. With only five minutes remaining and extra time looking a distinct possibility Ellis Rimmer, who had had a quiet match up till that point made his mark on the match. He chased a long through ball from Wilf Sharp and the tall winger got his head to the ball just before West Brom keeper Pearson could reach it and guided it into the net. In the final minute Rimmer scored his second goal when Pearson could only parry a Mark Hooper shot and Rimmer knocked the ball home from close range. Wednesday had won the cup and Ellis Rimmer had scored in every round.\"Sheffield Football, A History\", Keith Farnsworth,  Page 200 (Gives details of match).\"Wednesday\", Keith Farnsworth, pages 132\u2013135 (Gives details of match and team selections).", "| ||8 || Joe Carter"]}, {"page": "List of West Bromwich Albion F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Joe CarterStan Davies"]}, {"page": "Joe Carter (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Carter (English footballer)"]}, {"page": "1929 Spain v England football match", "response": ["Despite being played in searing heat which favoured the hosts, England went 2\u20130 up inside the opening 20 minutes through goals by Joe Carter and Joe Bradford following mistakes by goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora, a mainstay for Spain since their first international in 1920, and who injured his sternum early on. Spain came back into the match and levelled the score, goals from Gaspar Rubio and Jaime Lazcano making it 2\u20132 shortly before the half-time interval. England retook the lead in the second half thanks to a Carter penalty kick, only for Spain to again draw level and then take the lead themselves; Rubio scored the equaliser with 10 minutes remaining, and then , an amateur footballer, scored the match winning goal. Both goals resulted in a pitch invasion from ecstatic Spanish fans which caused slight delays to the match, and no further goals ensured Spain had made history.", "England's starting lineup, selected by an FA committee, had an average age of 28.9 years, and consisted of goalkeeper Ted Hufton behind a defensive pairing of Blenkinsop and Cooper, with Joe Peacock and Fred Kean at wing-half either side of Jack Hill, who was captaining England for what would be the sixth and final time. In the English attack, Joe Carter and Edgar Kail were positioned behind an attacking trio of outside left Leonard Barry and outside right Hugh Adcock, either side of centre forward Joe Bradford. Bradford was a surprise selection to the Spanish, who were expecting Dean to come back into the team to replace the injured Camsell. Both teams used a 2\u20133\u20135 formation.", "|IF || || Joe Carter"]}]}}
