Designed by architects John Pawson and Claudio Silvestrin in 1991, the modernist villa is a vacation house for a German art dealer set in an almond grove. Ware wanted the cover to emphasise architecture; as she explained in an interview with The Fader the week before the image was shot, \u201cThis record is so personal and romantic, that I want a nostalgic image on the front [...] I really want architecture in the album cover. I want to graduate from being in the [photo] studio for artwork where it had to be all about my face. I want it to be a beautiful image that maybe I'm a small part of.\u201d As a result, the cover is not exclusively focused on Ware. According to Pitchfork, \"the eye is drawn as much to the soft, ruddy brown of the walls or the blue sky packed into a crisp rectangle above her\", while Ware's name and the word \"Glasshouse\" are stylised in an uppercase pale pink font and located in the center of the image.
