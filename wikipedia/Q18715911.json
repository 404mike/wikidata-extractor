Recent scholarship rejects such identification and links; a common function alternatively proposed for the figures is as dolls for young girls.  Scholars like David Kinsley and Lynn Foulston accept the figurine-identifications, but rejects that there is any conclusive evidence to link them with Shaktism.Foulston, p. 4.Kinsley(a), p. 217.
