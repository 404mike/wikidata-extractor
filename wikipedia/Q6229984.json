With no money available for transfers he was forced to turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place."]}, {"page": "John Dowie", "response": ["John Dowie may refer to:", "*John Dowie (artist) (1915\u20132008), Australian sculptor and painter", "*John Dowie (footballer) (1955\u20132016), Scottish footballer", "*John Dowie (humourist) (born 1950), English comedian, musician and writer ", "*John Dowie (d.1817) owner of the infamous John Dowie's Tavern in Edinburgh"]}, {"page": "1978 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||6||John Dowie"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 in Scottish football", "response": ["*January: John Dowie, 60, Celtic and Clyde defenderDeath of former Celt John Dowie."]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 in English football", "response": ["* 22 January 2016: John Dowie, 60, Fulham and Doncaster Rovers midfielder."]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**John Dowie, 60, footballer (Fulham, Celtic)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2016", "response": ["*John Dowie, 60, Scottish footballer (Fulham, Celtic).John Dowie: 1955\u20132016"]}]}}
