It was at its peak of popularity when the television show World of Sport was launched in the mid-1960s, making household names out of Adrian Street, Mick McManus, Count Bartelli, Giant Haystacks, Jackie Pallo, Big Daddy, Steve Veidor, Dynamite Kid, and Kendo Nagasaki. ", "Standing apart from all this was the rise of \"Americanised\" promotions in the UK. One extremely early attempt at this kind of promotion in the UK was a set of \"American\u2013style\"/entertainment-orientated TV tapings arranged by Jackie Pallo in 1990. In the early 1990s, WAW and Hammerlock, both run by veterans of the traditional British circuit, emerged producing shows more in line with the slick entertainment ethos of American wrestling. In the late 1990s, the success and popularity of the American Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion, which specifically emphasised its own small scale and \"underground\" nature, combined with the growth of internet discussion boards and tape trading, generated a new interest in British wrestling among local fans of the American wrestling scene. Many of the promotions which started during this time were directly influenced by the style of ECW and most were designed to appeal more to smart mark fans rather than the more mainstream audiences targeted by the classic British wrestling era. The most high-profile American-style promotion of this period was the Ultimate Wrestling Alliance (UWA) which aired a regular television show, Wrestling Rampage, on controversial cable channel L!VE TV for a period in the spring and summer of 1999."]}, {"page": "Independent circuit", "response": ["Welsh promoter Orig Williams also used the BWF name, promoting from the late 1960s up until the early 2000s and then sporadically until his death in 2009.

Brian Dixon, a referee for Williams, set up his own company Wrestling Enterprises of Birkenhead later renamed All Star Wrestling circa 1984.

Wrestling Enterprises also collaborated heavily with another independent promoter, former middleweight star Jackie Pallo.
