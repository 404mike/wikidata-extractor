This was followed by in 1998, Ishfaq Ahmad, as PAEC chairman, reached another contract with CERN.

Also in 1997, the European Particle Physics Outreach Group, led by Christopher Llewellyn Smith, FRS, and Director General of CERN, was formed to create a community of scientists, science educators, and communication specialists in science education and public outreach for particle physics.  This group became the International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG) in 2011 after the start up of the LHC.About IPPOG. (n.d.).
