In 2012, Unicorn Kid had created tropical rave, a faster form of the genre which would become known as tropical house. However, it was not until 2013 with Klangkarussell's \"Sun Don't Shine\" and the emergence of producers such as Kygo and Robin Schulz that tropical house became a dance music trend. During 2014 and 2015, producers such as Lost Frequencies, Felix Jaehn, Alex Adair, Sam Feldt, Bakermat, Klingande and Faul & Wad Ad would join them with big tropical house hits. During the mid 2010s, certain tropical house producers would team up with artists such as Justin Bieber and Little Mix. This helped the genre achieve massive commercial success and gave rise to the  playlist term of 'tropical pop'."]}, {"page": "Sabin (surname)", "response": ["* Oliver Sabin (born 1991), Scottish electronic music/chip music composer known as Unicorn Kid"]}]}}
