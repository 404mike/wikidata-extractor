A spectator was killed in the incident having been hit by the right rear of Paddon's car. Although Paddon's car was not severely damaged and could have continued, the Hyundai team withdrew Paddon from the rally as a mark of respect. Prior to round 6 in Portugal, Paddon's long-time co-driver John Kennard decided to retire through injury, and he was replaced by Briton Sebastian Marshall. Overall, Paddon endured a frustrating season, picking up just two podiums in Poland and Australia. He led round 7 in Italy, until retiring late on day 2 after hitting a bank and breaking his right rear suspension."]}, {"page": "2010 Rallye de France", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Sebastian Marshall"]}, {"page": "2010 Rally Catalunya", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Sebastian Marshall"]}, {"page": "Rally Estonia", "response": ["|  Hayden Paddon Sebastian Marshall"]}, {"page": "2011 Rally Finland", "response": ["|  Sebastian Marshall"]}, {"page": "2012 World Rally Championship", "response": ["|  Sebastian Marshall", "|align=left|  Sebastian Marshall"]}, {"page": "2012 Rally Finland", "response": ["|  Sebastian Marshall", "|align=\"left\"|  Sebastian Marshall"]}, {"page": "Hyundai i20 WRC", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Sebastian Marshall"]}, {"page": "2013 European Rally Championship", "response": ["|  Sebastian Marshall"]}, {"page": "Paul Nagle", "response": ["He has co-driven for Kris Meeke since 2009, but without a full-time WRC programme, Nagle kept up his WRC experience by partnering other drivers including Craig Breen in 2012 and Andreas Mikkelsen in 2013.
