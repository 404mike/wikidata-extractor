The problem he posed was how dolphins can swim and accelerate so fast when it seemed their muscles lacked the needed power. If this is a problem with dolphins it is an even greater problem with billfish such as swordfish, which swim and accelerate faster than dolphins. In 2009, Taiwanese researchers from the National Chung Hsing University introduced new concepts of \"kidnapped airfoils and circulating horsepower\" to explain the swimming capabilities of swordfish. The researchers claim this analysis also \"solves the perplexity of dolphin's Gray paradox\". They also assert that swordfish \"use sensitive rostrum/lateral-line sensors to detect upcoming/ambient water pressure and attain the best attack angle to capture the body lift power aided by the forward-biased dorsal fin to compensate for most of the water resistance power.\""]}, {"page": "Hans Lissmann", "response": ["At the end of the 1920s he moved on to study Biology at the University of Hamburg.
