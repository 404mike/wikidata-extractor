He studied to become a minister at the University of Birmingham but did not complete his course, instead moving to Western Australia in 1905. Jones worked as an auctioneer and insurance agent, and also became an organiser for the Labor Party, running John McDonald's campaign at the 1911 state election and Alick McCallum's campaign at the 1913 federal election. He enlisted in the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in August 1915, and served in New Guinea until being discharged due to ill health in May 1917.After leaving the military, Jones arrived back in Australia in time to contest the 1917 state election, where he defeated William Carpenter of the National Labor Party in Fremantle. In 1919, in the aftermath of the Fremantle wharf riot, he was twice fined for giving speeches on the Fremantle Esplanade without the permission of the Fremantle Municipal Council. His subsequent unsuccessful appeals prompted a debate about freedom of speech. At the 1921 state election, Jones was defeated by a Nationalist candidate, Frank Gibson. He was taken ill in the middle of 1923, and died in Fremantle in January 1924, aged 38. He had married Winifred Alwina Ninke in 1915, with whom he had one daughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Jones", "response": ["Walter Jones may refer to:", "* Walter Jones (Virginia politician) (1745\u20131815), American Representative from Virginia from 1797\u20131799, and 1803\u20131811", "* Walter Jones (Irish politician) (1754\u20131839), MP for Coleraine 1798\u20131800, 1801\u201306 and 1807\u201309", "* Walter Jones (Australian politician) (1885\u20131924), Australian politician", "* Walter Jones (polo) (1866\u20131932), British polo competitor at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "* Walter Jones (Northern Irish footballer) (born 1925), Northern Irish professional footballer", "* Walter Jones (sailor) (1926\u20132007), Bermudian sailor", "* Walter Jones (American football) (born 1974), American former football player", "* Sir Walter Jones, 2nd Baronet (1880\u20131967), British industrialist", "* Walter Jones (priest) (died 1577), Welsh Anglican priest", "* Walter Jones, a character in Reviving Ophelia"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Fremantle", "response": ["| Walter Jones"]}, {"page": "Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 1917\u20131921", "response": ["| Walter Jones || Labor || Fremantle || 1917\u20131921"]}, {"page": "Electoral results for the district of Fremantle", "response": ["| Walter Jones"]}]}}
