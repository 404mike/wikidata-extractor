He studied under a private tutor along with brothers and even in his early days, took an interest in botany. He later went to London University where he studied under Robert Brown and John Lindley. He was also influenced by his friend R.H. Solly. He studied briefly at Paris under Charles Mirbel and at the Chelsea Physic Garden.  He received the Linnaean Gold Medal of the Society of Apothecaries in 1830 (botanical class) and joined the East India Company as an assistant surgeon at Madras on 24 September 1832. In 1835 he was deputed to join Nathaniel Wallich and John McClelland on a mission to examine tea cultivation in northeastern India. The Commissioner in Assam, Jenkins, later deputed him to visit the Mishmi Hills and the Lohit valley. He served with Major Robert Boileau Pemberton's mission to Bhutan in 1837. In 1839 he visited the Indus region and studied the botany of Afghanistan, returning to 1841 and recuperating in Shimla before visiting his brother at Jabalpur. When Nathaniel Wallich visited South Africa, he was made in-charge of the Calcutta Botanical Garden and also acted as Professor of Botany at the Medical College from 1842 to 1844. On being relieved, he moved back to the Straits of Malacca, falling ill and dying of a liver disorder on 10 February 1845.

When Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle erected a new genus, Pelargonium, in William Aiton\u2019s book Hortus Kewensis, published in 1789, he reassigned the species and made the new combination P. peltatum. Later, in 1792, L'H\u00e9ritier also described a comparable form and named it Pelargonium lateripes. In 1796, the English botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury renamed P. lateripes to P. hederaefolium, which is therefore a superfluous name. Henry Cranke Andrews in the first volume of his monography of the genus Geranium, that was published in 1805, distinguished P. peltatum var. variegatum, as well as G. hederinum  var. flore albo and  var. variegatum. In volume 2 that came out in 1806, he added P. peltatum var. superbum and G. hederinum  var. zonales. In his study Geraniaceae, Robert Sweet, described two forms that he called P. scutellatum and P. pinquifolium, although he suggested the latter may have been a hybrid. In 1824, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in his magnum opus Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis described P. lateripes var. albomarginatum and var. walneri, as well as P. peltatum var. zonatum. In the same year, Johann Centurius Hoffmannsegg made a description of P. glabrum. Sweet described in 1826 three more forms in his Hortus Brittanicus, which he named P. lateripes var. roseus, var. viridifolium and var. zonation. In 1835, Christian Friedrich Ecklon and Karl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher created a new genus, Dibrachya, which they had based on the section that Sweet had erected earlier, and made the new combinations D. peltata, D. scutellata and D. clypeata. Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel moved the latter to Pelargonium creating P. clypeatum. William Henry Harvey in the 1860 Flora Capensis made the new combinations P. peltatum var. scutellatum, var. clypeatum and var. glabrum. Jean Baptiste Saint-Lager changed the name of P. lateripes to P. lateripedatum, a superfluous name in 1880. In 1890, Robert Brown (R.Br.ter) described P. saxifragoides. Otto Kuntze erected the genus Geraniospermum and made the new combination Geraniospermum peltatum in 1891. As part of his extensive 1912 treatment of several plant families, Reinhard Gustav Paul Knuth described a form from Pondoland as P. bachmannii.
