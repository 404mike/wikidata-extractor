Tyrrell propounded a moderate Whiggism which interpreted England's balanced and mixed constitution \"as the product of a contextualized social compact blending elements of custom, history, and prescription with inherent natural law obligations\".Ward, p. 14 However, Sidney emphasised the main themes of republicanism and based Whig ideology in the sovereignty of the people by proposing a constitutional reordering that would both elevate the authority of Parliament and democratise its forms. Sidney also emphasised classical republican notions of virtue.Ward, ch. 6 Ward says that Locke's liberal Whiggism rested on a radically individualist theory of natural rights and limited government.Ward, ch. 8\u20139 Tyrrell's moderate position came to dominate Whiggism and British constitutionalism as a whole from 1688 to the 1770s.Ward, ch. 11 The more radical ideas of Sidney and Locke, argues Ward, became marginalised in Britain, but emerged as a dominant strand in American republicanism. The issues raised by the Americans, starting with the Stamp Act crisis of 1765, ripped Whiggism apart in a battle of parliamentary sovereignty (Tyrrell) versus popular sovereignty (Sidney and Locke).Ward, pp. 327\u201350"]}, {"page": "Anthropodermic bibliopegy", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"1691\"|Bibliotheca politica (1691\u20131694) by James Tyrrell"]}, {"page": "Timothy Tyrrell", "response": ["Their first son was James Tyrrell and second son was John Tyrrell."]}, {"page": "James Tyrrell (Oakley)", "response": ["#REDIRECTJames Tyrrell (writer)"]}, {"page": "James Tyrrell(Oakley)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Tyrrell (writer)"]}, {"page": "James Tyrrell (disambiguation)", "response": ["James Tyrrell (c. 1450\u20131502) was the alleged murderer of the Princes in the Tower.", "James Tyrrell may also refer to:", "*James Tyrrell (writer) (1642\u20131718), English author and political philosopher", "*James Tyrrell (British Army officer) (c. 1674\u20131742), MP for Boroughbridge"]}, {"page": "Robert Brady (writer)", "response": ["In historical controversy, he was opposed to William Petyt and James Tyrrell, along what would become Tory versus Whig lines, then forming in the Exclusion crisis of the 1680s.

Historian and political theorist James Tyrrell, grandson of Sir Timothy the elder, grew up at Shotover before moving to Oakley in 1670 after his marriage. Tyrrell divided his time between Oakley and Shotover. Tyrrell was a close friend of John Locke, whom he met at Oxford in 1658. Locke was a frequent guest at Shotover in the late 1670s and early 1680s, and he stored papers and books there for safekeeping when he was forced to flee to Holland in 1683. Tyrrell eventually sold Oakley and moved back to Shotover after James II forced him out of local governance in Buckinghamshire for refusing to sign the Declaration of Indulgence in 1687.", "Sir Timothy the younger died in 1701. The construction of the current Shotover Park began circa 1714\u201315 under his son James, and was located approximately  east of the site of the house visited by Queen Elizabeth. In 1717\u201318, he built a Gothic temple at Shotover. The temple, with corner turrets, arcaded loggia, and battlemented gable, is possibly the first intimation of the Gothic Revival architecture in England. James died the following year and the construction of the building was continued under his son, Lieutenant-General James Tyrrell, an Army officer and MP.", "The architect of the new house commissioned by Sir Timothy is uncertain, but Shotover Park is believed to have been designed by William Townsend (or Townesend; 1676\u20131739), an Oxford architect and mason who worked on many buildings at Oxford University, and who was the son of Mayor of Oxford John Townesend. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner  wrote in the Oxfordshire edition of his Buildings of England series that Shotover Park has strong similarities with The Queen's College, Oxford, linking it to Townsend. Construction was likely completed by 1720; the date 1718 does appear on rainwater heads. The design of the elder James Tyrrell's Gothic temple has been attributed to Townsend or to James Gibbs.", "James Tyrrell died in 1742 and left the estate to the family of his friend, the Baron Augustus Sch\u00fctz, a Hanoverian favourite of King George I, who became Master of the Robes to King George II. It passed to his son, George Frederick Schutz, who was Groom of the Bedchamber to King George III, and in turn to his son, Thomas James Schutz."]}]}}
