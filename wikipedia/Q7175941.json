Worship continued in the church until the last service, which was held in February 1967. The building was acquired later that year by the Peter Moores Foundation. Work then began to convert it into the first community arts project in the United Kingdom, combining a contemporary arts centre with a community centre. In 1975 the interior was remodelled by Kingham Knight Associates, removing all the fittings, and dividing it into two floors.
