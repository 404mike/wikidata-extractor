Edward Thompson was born at Marlborough, Wiltshire on 25 June 1881. He was the son of an assistant master at Marlborough College. He was educated at Marlborough before taking the Mechanical Science Tripos at Pembroke College, Cambridge, earning a third class degree. Thompson's academic background contrasts with that of his predecessor Nigel Gresley, who had also attended Marlborough, but then gained practical experience as a pupil at Horwich Works.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nigel Gresley", "response": ["He was succeeded as the LNER CME by Edward Thompson."]}, {"page": "London and North Eastern Railway", "response": ["* Edward Thompson's short reign (1941\u20131946) was a controversial one. A reputed detractor of Gresley even before his elevation to the post of CME, there are those who interpret many of his actions as being motivated by dislike of his predecessor; this demonisation has been questioned by Simon A.C. Martin who argues that his actions were directed by the needs of WWII rather than dislike of Gresley or his practices. Thompson accepted that Gresley's designs had their flaws as well as their brilliance but still included them as part of his future locomotive stud. His record is best served by his solid and dependable freight and mixed-traffic locomotives built under and for wartime conditions.

Thompson intended to rebuild to this configuration all the Gresley A1s that had not been converted to A3 standard; in the meantime the remaining Gresley A1s were reclassified as A10s.  The rebuilding of these locomotives as A1/1 never happened.  Instead, the conversion to A3 standard continued.

David & Charles. Newton Abbot, 1986 This had the effect of causing the middle cylinder to operate at a longer cutoff than the outer cylinders, therefore producing a disproportionate share of the total power output, leading to increased wear of the middle big end. Sustained high speed running could sometimes cause the big end to wear rapidly enough that the increased travel afforded to the middle piston by the increased play in the bearing was enough to knock the ends off the middle cylinder.  This happened during the  run of \"Silver Fox\".Allen, CJ, \"Two Million Miles of Train Travel\",  Although the problem could be contained in a peacetime environment with regular maintenance and inspections, it proved to be poorly suited to the rigors of heavy running and low maintenance levels of World War II. This gave rise to big-end problems on the centre cylinder connecting rod on the famous A4 class of streamlined Pacifics and many of these locomotives were fitted with a reduced diameter piston and had the inside cylinder sleeved down as a temporary measure. LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard suffered centre cylinder big-end damage (indicated to the driver by the fracture of a \"stink bomb\" attached to the bearing, which fractures during overheating of the white metal) during its world record run and was forced to limp back to its depot for repairs afterwards.  Gresley's successor at the LNER, Edward Thompson, was critical of this particular valve gear.(LNER) Encyclopedia Edward Thompson page retrieved 1 October 2006 As well as introducing new two-cylinder designs, he set about rebuilding Gresley locomotives with separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear for each cylinder.(LNER) Encyclopedia A1/1 page retrieved 1 October 2006"]}, {"page": "LNER Peppercorn Class A2", "response": ["The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) Peppercorn Class A2 is a class of steam locomotive designed for express passenger work by Arthur Peppercorn, the chief designer of the LNER after Edward Thompson.

The design was to draw heavily on the A1/1 Pacific Great Northern which had been rebuilt during Thompson's time in office. This would have created a cross between the A2/3 Pacifics, and Great Northerns 6'8\" driving wheels. By the time Peppercorn was in office, reports of Great Northerns persistent frame problems, hot axleboxes and steam leaks were all filtering back into the design office. The belief was that the problems were caused by a lack of frame support at the front end, largely due to the cylinders not being aligned with each other (an aspect of divided drive combined with equal length connecting rods). Thompson's guidelines would have produced another locomotive with the cylinders apart, so Peppercorn decided against it, and brought the cylinders in line, and arranged the locomotive as something of a merging of both Gresley's A4 and Thompson's A2/1, creating first the A2 class, and then the A1."]}, {"page": "NER Class S3", "response": ["* B16/3 Introduced 1944, LNER rebuilds of B16/1 by Edward Thompson with three sets of Walschaerts valve gear and left-hand drive."]}]}}
