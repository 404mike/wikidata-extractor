He became Chairman of the Conservative Research Department, assisted by David Clarke and Michael Fraser. He was opposed to detailed policy-making, not least as he felt the party was not yet pointing in the ideological direction he wanted. In 1946, he became chairman of the Industrial Policy Committee. In 1947, the Industrial Charter was produced, advocating full employment and acceptance of the welfare state (Butler himself said that those who advocated \"creating pools of unemployment should be thrown into them and made to swim\"). In 1950, he welcomed the \"One Nation\" pamphlet produced by new MPs including Iain Macleod, Angus Maude, Edward Heath and Enoch Powell.", "Along with the 1944 Education Act and his reforms as Home Secretary, John Campbell sees Butler's greatest achievement as the \"redefine(ing of) the meaning of Conservatism\" in Opposition, encouraging the careers of talented younger men at the Research Department (Heath, Powell, Maudling, Macleod, Angus Maude, all of whom entered Parliament in 1950) ensuring Conservative acceptance of the welfare state and a commitment to keeping unemployment low. Macmillan acknowledged Butler's role in his memoirs, whilst stressing that these were the very policies he had promoted in vain in the 1930s.Campbell 2009, p. 255.
