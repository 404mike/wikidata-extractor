Despite inconsistent results, fans threw their support behind Lee after witnessing consistent improvements in the Vale's performances. He solved his goalkeeping problems by signing Keith Ball from Walsall for 'a small fee', and his side put together a five-game unbeaten run in November. He adopted a more 'hit and run' style in March, and his side ended the campaign in 13th place with 46 points from their 46 games, scoring 46 and conceding 46 goals."]}, {"page": "Hickson", "response": ["*Geoff Hickson (born 1939), English former football goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "Potteries derby", "response": ["| style=\"background:#fdf;\" | Geoff Hickson"]}, {"page": "George Geoffrey Hickson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoff Hickson"]}, {"page": "George Hickson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoff Hickson"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Hickson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoff Hickson"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Geoff Hickson"]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Geoff Hickson"]}, {"page": "1968\u201369 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with four Roy Chapman goals in four games, though only three points were won in the first six encounters.

Lee quickly earned the respect of the Vale fans despite his team lying bottom of the table in mid-September. A new club mascot was unveiled at this time \u2013 'Prince Val'. Some good home performances lifted the club off the bottom of the table, including a 4\u20131 thumping of Scunthorpe United and a stylish back-heeled goal from Roy Sproson in a 1\u20131 draw with Lincoln City. Chapman then developed sciatica and had to be rested until December. An excellent defence helped the club then to achieve a five-game unbeaten run in the league. In November, goalkeeper Keith Ball was signed from Walsall for 'a small fee' and Graham Newton joined on trial after leaving the Atlanta Chiefs. On Boxing day, Vale travelled to Sincil Bank, where they beat second-placed Lincoln 1\u20130 in front of 12,208 spectators.
