He unsuccessfully contested the Faversham constituency in 1931 and 1935, and was elected at the 1945 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham South. He held that seat until for ten years, until his defeat at the 1955 election by the Conservative Party candidate Denis Keegan.\nAn outspoken MP, he was known for not always following the Government brief:\n\"Mr. Smith has the engaging quality of hitting hard without making personal charges against the integrity and motives of those who think differently. He said many things that made the House gasp, and many that made it laugh...\"With Robert Boothby he was almost alone in condemnation of the Bretton Woods system. He also found Keynesian economics wanting. In his book Politics of Plenty (published 1944) he warned his readers of the dangers of Keynes:\n\"In due course the Keynes plan for an irresponsible world financial government came to maturity and, by hole and corner methods for which Britain's third Labour Government must share responsibility, was thrust on an unsuspecting world.\"\nHe complained that British politics regarded financial policy as being something over and above party strife; to accept the rules of orthodox financial practice as being conventions to which all political parties must defer.\nHe was a supporter of Social Credit \u2013 believing that it could solve the problems of modern banking, highlighted by the 1930s depression. He wrote many articles supporting Social Credit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Norman Smith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Norman Smith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Norman Smith"]}, {"page": "Nottingham South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Norman Smith"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Co-operative MPs", "response": ["* Norman Smith, Nottingham South, 1945\u20131955"]}, {"page": "Henry Norman Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Norman Smith (politician)"]}, {"page": "Norman Smith", "response": ["*Norman Smith (journalist) (born 1959), British BBC journalist", "*Norman Smith (record producer) (1923\u20132008), English musician, record producer and engineer", "*Norman Smith (politician) (1890\u20131962), British Labour Party politician", "*Norman Smith (footballer, born September 1897) (1897\u20131978), footballer for Charlton Athletic and Queens Park Rangers", "*Norman Smith (footballer, born December 1897) (1897\u20131978), footballer for Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Queens Park Rangers, and later manager of Newcastle United", "*Norman Smith (South African footballer) (born 1982), South African footballer for Jomo Cosmos"]}]}}
