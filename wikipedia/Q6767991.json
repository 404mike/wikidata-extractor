Mark formerly worked at Reaction Engines Limited, where he was a member of the board of directors as the Future Programmes Director.He has a BSc in Physics from Imperial College London and Masters in Astronomy and Astronautics from Hatfield Polytechnic, now the University of Hertfordshire. As a Business Development Manager he ran infrastructure studies on launch systems (BAe HOTOL, MacDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper), European space stations and the BAe Multirole Capsule.He was the president of the British Interplanetary Society from 1997 to 2000 and from 2015 to 2018, and was editor of the JBIS periodical from 2005-2009.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Skylon (spacecraft)", "response": ["* Mark Hempsell from REL on The Space Show talking about Skylon"]}, {"page": "Alan Bond (engineer)", "response": ["In a self-published bookBond, A. and M. Hempsell, 2008, A Sumerian Observation of the K\u00f6fels' Impact Event, WritersPrintshop, London, United Kingdom. 128 pp.  co-authored with Mark Hempsell, Bond claimed to have deciphered an Assyrian clay tablet dated to 700 BC that they argued might describe an asteroid strike causing a landslide at K\u00f6fels in Tyrol in 3123 BC. They relate this to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.Fleming, N., 2008, Clay tablet holds clue to asteroid mystery, Daily Telegraph The landslide is normally dated to about 9800 years ago, long before the tablet was recorded and over 4500 years before the Bristol researchers' date.Kubik, P.

The impact theory had already been proposed in 1936 by the Austrian scientist Franz Eduard Suess and later on by Alexander Tollmann, who hypothesized impacts in around 7640 BC and 3150 BC, respectively. The question of whether an impact caused the landslide has been researched by others and no evidence was found for an asteroid, meteorite or comet, and geologists consider it to have been caused by other factors such as 'deep creep'.Deutsch, A., C.

It is designed to be suitable for adoption as an industry standard. Development is currently being undertaken by Mark Hempsell at Hempsell Astronautics Ltd. The rationale for the creation of an industry standard for spacecraft interfaces is that the number of applications for space vehicles is likely to increase greatly in the future (space tourism being a recent example). If each craft is utilising a common interface many new applications become feasible. This is somewhat analogous to the benefits which have been gained by widespread adoption of the USB connector in computing or even the standardisation of AC power plugs and sockets across some parts of the world."]}, {"page": "Hempsell, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Hempsell"]}]}}
