She was a Fellow of New Hall, Cambridge (1965\u20131966) and then Somerville College, Oxford (1966\u20132001). She was also Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford from 1998 to 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hamlet", "response": ["The phrase \"little eyases\"Hamlet F1 2.2.337. in the First Folio (F1) may allude to the Children of the Chapel, whose popularity in London forced the Globe company into provincial touring. This became known as the War of the Theatres, and supports a 1601 dating. Katherine Duncan-Jones accepts a 1600\u201301 attribution for the date Hamlet was written, but notes that the Lord Chamberlain's Men, playing Hamlet in the 3000-capacity Globe, were unlikely to be put to any disadvantage by an audience of \"barely one hundred\" for the Children of the Chapel's equivalent play, Antonio's Revenge; she believes that Shakespeare, confident in the superiority of his own work, was making a playful and charitable allusion to his friend John Marston's very similar piece."]}, {"page": "Philip Sidney", "response": ["An early biography of Sidney was written by his friend and schoolfellow, Fulke Greville. While Sidney was traditionally depicted as a staunch and unwavering Protestant, recent biographers such as Katherine Duncan-Jones have suggested that his religious loyalties were more ambiguous. He was known to be friendly and sympathetic towards individual Catholics."]}, {"page": "John Stow", "response": ["Stow's widow commissioned a mural monument to him in St Andrew Undershaft, made of Derbyshire marble and alabaster. The work has been tentatively attributed to Nicholas Johnson.Taylor 1974.Katherine Duncan-Jones, \"Afterword: Stow's remains\", in Gadd and Gillespie 2004, pp. 157\u201363. It includes an effigy of Stow, which was originally coloured: he is represented seated at a desk, writing in a book (probably the revision of his Annales, which he continued to 26 March, ten days before his death), and flanked by other books. Above him is the motto, based on an epigram of Pliny the Younger, Aut scribenda agere, aut legenda scribere (\"[Blessed is he to whom it is given] either to do things that are worth writing about, or to write things that are worth reading about\"). The figure holds a real quill pen, in a manner similar to the effigy of William Shakespeare at Stratford-upon-Avon: the latter monument has been attributed, on equally tentative grounds, either to Nicholas Johnson's brother, Gerard, or more recently to Nicholas himself.The two monuments are compared in Duncan-Jones 2004."]}, {"page": "John Shakespeare", "response": ["The only record that survives of Shakespeare's personality is a note written by Thomas Plume fifty years after his death. Plume records a conversation with Sir John Mennes (1599\u20131671), who stated that he had once met him in his shop and described him as a \"merry cheeked old man\" who said of his son that \"Will was a good honest fellow, but he durst have cracked a jest with him at any time.\"Kate Pogue, Shakespeare's Family, Greenwood, 2008, p. 24. As Katherine Duncan-Jones points out, this is impossible, since Mennes was two years old when John Shakespeare died. She thinks Plume may have been recording an anecdote related by Mennes taken from his father.Katherine Duncan-Jones, Ungentle Shakespeare: Scenes from His Life, Cengage Learning EMEA, 2001, p. 8"]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Katherine Duncan-Jones"]}, {"page": "Chandos portrait", "response": ["The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 124, No. 948, March 1982, pp. 146-147+149.  but the first known reference to the painting is in a note written in 1719 by George Vertue, who states that it was painted by John Taylor, a respected member of the Painter-Stainers' company who may also have been the same John Taylor who acted with the Children of Paul's.Cooper et al., 54. Vertue refers to Taylor as an actor and painter and as Shakespeare's \"intimate friend\". Katherine Duncan-Jones argues that 'John Taylor' could have been a misreading of what had originally been \"Jo: Taylor\"; she suggests that this may refer to the actor Joseph Taylor, who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the older Shakespeare.Katherine Duncan-Jones, \"A precious memento: The Chandos Portrait and Shakespeare's 'intimate friend'\", Times Literary Supplement, April 25, 2014, pp.13\u201315. "]}, {"page": "The Phoenix and the Turtle", "response": ["Katherine Duncan-Jones and Henry Woudhuysen adopt a variation of the view that the poem refers to Salusbury and the queen, arguing that the \"session\" mentioned in the poem is the 1601 parliament, in which Elizabeth made a famous speech about the symbolic relationship between herself and her people, sometimes referred to as her Farewell Speech.Duncan-Jones and Woudhuyson, Shakespeare's Poems, Arden Shakespeare, Cengage Learning EMEA, 2007, p.421ff. They draw on the earlier work of Marie Axton, who argued that Elizabeth herself is both birds, in her monarchical and human aspects, but that the human aspect (the Turtle) also includes the body of the people as a whole. Duncan-Jones and Woudhuysen suggest that Salusbury represents the people."]}, {"page": "A. N. Wilson", "response": ["He married the Shakespearean scholar Katherine Duncan-Jones in 1971, prior to his graduation. They had two daughters, Emily Wilson (born 1971) and Beatrice \"Bee\" Wilson (born 1974), and divorced in 1990. He is now married to the art historian Ruth Guilding."]}, {"page": "The Herbal Bed", "response": ["In the play the principal witness Robert Whatcott does not appear in the court scene, but is named as the author of the letter to Hall outlining Lane's slanders. Lane was a member of a local gentry family, but was not studying medicine with Hall. The suggestion in the play that Shakespeare himself may be suffering from a venereal disease in his last years has been made by some biographers. Katherine Duncan-Jones argues that he suffered from syphilis.Katherine Duncan-Jones, Ungentle Shakespeare: Scenes from his Life, Arden Shakespeare, Cengage Learning, 2001, p266. However, there is no evidence that he was seriously ill in 1613. Indeed, in November 1614 Shakespeare was in London on business for several weeks with Hall.Honan, 387."]}, {"page": "Sonnet 11", "response": ["Sonnet 11 begins with calling out the Youth on his slow decline in beauty. To paraphrased the first two lines, \"As fast as you decline in beauty, so in your child you grow into that beauty which you yourself leave behind\". This is also the beginning of the speaker's push for the Youth to have a child within this particular sonnet. William Rolfe takes these same two lines and rolls out a thicker interpretation. He explains that having children explored how no matter how fast a person increases in age; the youth the young man has lost will be placed into his offspring. Rolfe ends his description by saying, \"As it were, growing afresh that which thou departest (to depart) from\". This verse truly sets the stage for what the speaker wishes to convey most to the fair youth. Katherine Duncan-Jones expands that by paraphrasing the speaker's meaning behind line 3, saying, \"You give your blood (semen) to a wife while you are young, and, perhaps, in a youthful manner\". The speaker has found every way to push at the idea of the Fair Youth marrying and having children."]}]}}
