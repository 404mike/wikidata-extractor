Work did begin on an untitled follow-up to Dos Dedos Mis Amigos, with the band entering the studio in 1996. Their sixth studio album, which had been intended for Stateside release via Nothing, would not see release before the band broke up, however. Member Graham Crabb quit the band to focus on his ambient  project Golden Claw Musics. Members Richard March and Robert \"Fuzz\" Townshend went on to form the big beat band Bentley Rhythm Ace.

Though initially associated with the C86 scene, their rougher, rockier sound led to them being championed by the music press as one of several grebo bands that were emerging from Midlands, with the word \"grebo\" itself having been revived by the band. Band member Graham Crabb said: \"We revived this '70s [slang] word for dork or nerd, and the press had to build this movement around it to describe everyone with long hair and a nasty guitar sound.\" The band thought their musical style was \"pretty much going down a cul de sac\" until they found numerous other \"more interesting\" influences. Crabb reflected: \"We just started listening to a lot of new stuff, stuff we hadn't heard before. We saw Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys come over and play, and they blew us away.\"", "This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This! features the band's unique \"mesh and mix\" of pop culture from the United States and particularly the United Kingdom, and combines metal guitar riffs, disco backing and conspicuous drum stomps. Throughout the album, there are what AllMusic's Ned Raggett described as \"intriguing surprises\", including multiple moody goth and post-punk elements. Influences of rap, heavy metal and the band's early influence of punk rock are spliced with numerous \"found\" auto artefacts \"collected from all over the junk-culture landscape\", including Motown snippets, advertising slogans and the \"play-by-play call of a John Elway touchdown pass. The music press found the band's sound hard to categorise. Band member Graham Crabb explained: \"Nobody's really come up with a description of what we do, and we're quite happy about that. It gives us absolute freedom.\"", "Trouser Press were very favourable to the album, calling it an \"aurally exciting sonic collage\" and concluding that, \"bright, vital and bitingly funny, this record teems with invention.\" Jason Ankeny of AllMusic called it the band's masterpiece. It was cited as the first of three consecutive groundbreaking albums by the band in The Rough Guide to Rock. On the BBC's \"Keeping It Peel\" feature, they described the album as the band's \"most effective outing\", while Jason Heller of The A.V. Club called the album an \"electronic, sample-heavy classic.\" At the end of 1989, NME ranked the album at number 22 in its list of the 50 best albums of the year.
