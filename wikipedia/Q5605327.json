Morley said in response that \"I have made a mistake, I apologise for that and I take full responsibility\". In November 2007, Morley \"flipped\" his designated second home from Scunthorpe to a London property he was renting out to another MP Ian Cawsey. For four months Morley claimed full mortgage interest on the London house and Cawsey, who had designated the house as his second home, continued to claim \u00a31,000 a month as rent paid to Morley. The fees office discovered that the two MPs were both claiming for the same property in March 2008 but the arrangements were not reported or independently investigated. In the hours following these allegations being made, it was announced that Morley had been suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party. The Telegraph also alleged that Morley rented out a London flat designated as his main residence to another Labour MP, Ian Cawsey, a close friend and former special adviser. Cawsey named the property as his second home, allowing him to also claim \u00a31,000 a month in expenses to cover the rent which he was charged by Morley.

Morley told BBC News that he had repaid the money two weeks prior to the Telegraph story breaking upon realising he had mistakenly continued claiming for his mortgage payments after the mortgage had been paid off in 2006. On 14 May 2009 he was suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party because of this scandal.
