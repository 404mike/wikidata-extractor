Santigold said: \"I keep a Rolodex of the women that vocally inspire me. There aren't that many, but she's definitely one of them. I remember one of the first times I heard \"Red Light\" it was at a party, and I remember going up to the DJ and being like, \"Who's this?\". It was that good. I kind of stopped and was like\u00a0... wow. There's not a tremendous amount of women who are bold and forward thinking as artists. I feel like her music, at the time especially, was pretty unique in the way that it sort of matched her style.

With the energy and music of the band, plus the light sequences that Adam helped Eli develop, there was no other show in LA quite like it. Little Red Radio played many packed out venues such as The Key Club, On The Rox, The Roxy, The Viper Room, House of Blues, Silverlake Lounge, The Satellite, The Echo, The Echoplex, Club Avalon, Steve Aoki's Dim Mak, countless warehouse parties and club nights.
