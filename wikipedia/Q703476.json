He is the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories, many of them winners of literary awards. Three of his novels have been filmed.\nSince he first came to prominence in the mid-1960s, critics have cited Campbell as one of the leading writers in his field: T. E. D. Klein has written that \"Campbell reigns supreme in the field today\", and Robert Hadji has described him as \"perhaps the finest living exponent of the British weird fiction tradition\", while S. T. Joshi stated, \"future generations will regard him as the leading horror writer of our generation, every bit the equal of Lovecraft or Blackwood.\" In a 2021 appreciation of his collected works, The Washington Post said, \"[t]aken together, they constitute one of the monumental accomplishments of modern popular fiction.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August Derleth", "response": ["Such debates aside, Derleth's founding of Arkham House and his successful effort to rescue Lovecraft from literary oblivion are widely acknowledged by practitioners in the horror field as seminal events in the field. For instance, Ramsey Campbell has acknowledged Derleth's encouragement and guidance during the early part of his own writing career,For example, in The Count of Thirty (Necronomicon Press 1993), p. 11. and Kirby McCauley has cited Derleth and Arkham House as an inspiration for his own anthology Dark Forces.Kirby McCauley, Introduction, Dark Forces (1980).  Arkham House and Derleth published Dark Carnival, the first book by Ray Bradbury, as well. Brian Lumley cites the importance of Derleth to his own Lovecraftian work, and contends in a 2009 introduction to Derleth's work that he was \"...one of the first, finest, and most discerning editors and publishers of macabre fiction.\"", "Important as was Derleth's work to rescue H.P. Lovecraft from literary obscurity at the time of Lovecraft's death, Derleth also built a body of horror and spectral fiction of his own; still frequently anthologized. The best of this work, recently reprinted in four volumes of short stories \u2013 most of which were originally published in Weird Tales, illustrates Derleth's original abilities in the genre. While Derleth considered his work in this genre less important than his most serious literary efforts, the compilers of these four anthologies, including Ramsey Campbell, note that the stories still resonate after more than 50 years."]}, {"page": "Fritz Leiber", "response": ["Many of Leiber's most acclaimed works are short stories, especially in the horror genre. Owing to such stories as \"The Smoke Ghost\", \"The Girl With the Hungry Eyes\", and \"You're All Alone\" (later expanded as The Sinful Ones), he is one of the forerunners of the modern urban horror story. Leiber also challenged the conventions of science fiction through reflexive narratives such as \"A Bad Day For Sales\" (first published in Galaxy Science Fiction, July 1953), in which the protagonist, Robie, \"America\u2019s only genuine mobile salesrobot\",Leiber, Fritz. \"A Bad Day For Sales\".
