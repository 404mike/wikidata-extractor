Kazuo Miyagawa, as Daiei Film's cameraman, invented bleach bypass for Ichikawa's film, inspired by the color rendition in the original release of Moby-Dick (1956), printed using dye-transfer Technicolor, and was achieved through the use of an additional black and white overlay. Actually, this is a throwback to pre-1944 Technicolor, which incorporated a silver-containing \"blank receiver\" with the silver image printed from the green separation negative, but at 50-percent density, upon which the color dyes were imprinted by utilizing \"imbibition\"; this concept may have been employed here, but at a different density. Despite this early foray into the technique, it remained overlooked for the most part until its use by Roger Deakins for the movie 1984. The effect has subsequently become a regular development tool in labwork, and has remained in widespread use. Practitioners include cinematographers Rodrigo Prieto, Remi Adefarasin, Darius Khondji, Dariusz Wolski, Walter Carvalho,  Oliver Stapleton, Newton Thomas Sigel, Park Gok-ji, Shane Hurlbut, Steven Soderbergh (as \"Peter Andrews\"), Tom Stern, Vittorio Storaro, and Janusz Kami\u0144ski (notably on Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report)."]}, {"page": "52nd British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["Elizabeth \u2013 Remi Adefarasin"]}, {"page": "American Society of Cinematographers Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical Releases", "response": ["| Elizabeth  || Remi Adefarasin", "* Remi Adefarasin"]}, {"page": "List of black Academy Award winners and nominees", "response": ["| Remi Adefarasin"]}]}}
