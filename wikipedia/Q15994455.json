This included four subgenera that had previously been proposed for bird-infecting Plasmodium species by A. Corradetti in 1963. This scheme was expanded upon by Sam R. Telford in 1988 when he reclassified Plasmodium parasites that infect reptiles, adding five subgenera. In 1997, G. Valkiunas reclassified the bird-infecting Plasmodium species adding a fifth subgenus: Bennettinia."]}, {"page": "Plasmodium knowlesi", "response": ["Soon thereafter, in 1935 C. E. Van Rooyen and George R. Pile reported using P. knowlesi infection to treat general paralysis in psychiatric patients. P. knowlesi would go on to be used as a general pyretic agent for various diseases, particularly neurosyphilis for which it was used until at least 1955. While Cyril Garnham had suggested in 1957 that P. knowlesi might naturally infect humans, the first documented case of a human naturally infected with P. knowlesi was in 1965 in a U.S. Army surveyor who developed chills and fever after a five-day deployment in Malaysia. Based on this finding, a team at the Institute for Medical Research in Peninsular Malaysia undertook a survey of people living in proximity to macaques, but failed to find evidence that simian malaria was being transmitted to humans."]}, {"page": "Vinckeia", "response": ["Vinckeia is a subgenus of the genus Plasmodium \u2014 all of which are parasitic alveolates.

Clyde studied from the age of 7 at boarding school in England. In 1940 he was sent to live with relatives in Kansas City, Kansas, where he attended high school. In 1946 he received a bachelor's degree from the University of Kansas. He received in 1948 his medical degree from McGill University Faculty of Medicine in Montreal. Following his medical internship at Vancouver General Hospital in 1949, he married Kathleen Templeton. He then joined in 1949 the British Colonial Medical Service and served in Tanganyika in the mid-1950s as a clinician, malariologist, senior epidemiologist, and then, in the early 1960s, deputy surgeon general in the newly independent Tanzania. In 1963 he received a PhD, under the supervision of Cyril Garnham,  in parasitology from the University of London for research on malaria. In 1966 Clyde left Tanzania to do research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine on malaria prevention and therapies. He worked there until 1975. From 1975 to 1979 he was a professor and the head of the department of tropical medicine and medical parasitology at Louisiana State University School of Medicine in New Orleans. From 1979 to 1985, Clyde served as head of the World Health Organization's Southeast Asia Division based in Delhi, India. In 1985 he became the director of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and also served, until 1992, as the head of malaria studies at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD).

She changed to focus on parasitology research, joining the lab of Lucien Brumpt in 1964 as a research assistant, and a year later relocating to Alain Chabaud's group at the MNHN. She was promoted in 1966 to senior lecturer and made group head of studying the Plasmodium genus. She briefly worked in London in the 1960s in the group of Cyril Garnham at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, where she met and begun collaborating with Wallace Peters and Robert Killick-Kendrick. During a research trip to the Central African Republic in 1964/5 Landau isolated and described the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi (naming it after her supervisor) from local Thamnomys rutilans thicket rats. She brought these samples with her to London, and together with Killick-Kendrich they isolated and identified another new rodent malaria species. The species was similar to Plasmodium berghei, and it was named Plasmodium yoelii in homage to the malarial researcher Meir Yoeli. To this day both species are used extensively in malaria research. Peters, Landau and Killick-Kendrick styled themselves as the 'plasmodiacs'."]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Jon Shaw", "response": ["He gained a BSc in Zoology in 1960 at London University's Queen Mary College (now Queen Mary University) of London and a PhD in 1964 at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine under the guidance of Percy Cyril Garnham and Cecil Hoare.
