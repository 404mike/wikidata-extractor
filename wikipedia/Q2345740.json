He was the son of James Staats Forbes (1823\u20131904).\nForbes studied natural sciences at St John's College, Cambridge, and later taught at Rhodes College (then known as Stewart College). In 1879 he was appointed prosector to the Zoological Society of London on the death of the previous incumbent, Alfred Henry Garrod, who was Forbes's friend and whose literary executor Forbes became. Forbes lectured on comparative anatomy at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School. As an anatomist, he wrote valuable papers on the muscular structure and voice organs of birds.\nIn 1880 Forbes visited the forests of Pernambuco, Brazil, and published an account of his trip in The Ibis in 1881. In 1882 he travelled to west Africa to study the native fauna, starting from the mouth of the Niger delta. He was taken ill shortly after Christmas and died in Shonga.On 8 February 1878, Forbes was elected Secretary of the Cambridge Natural History Society. He also edited the book compiling the late Alfred Henry Garrod's scientific papers; the book was published in 1881 along with a memoir of Garrod written by Forbes.\nForbes is commemorated in the names of the Forbes's blackbird Anumara forbesi, white-collared kite Leptodon forbesi and the Forbes's plover Charadrius forbesi.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Koala", "response": ["The first living koala in Britain arrived in 1881, purchased by the Zoological Society of London.

His new genus name prevailed and, when the Italian zoologist Tommaso Salvadori combined it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a tautonym (a scientific name in which the two parts are identical). Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus, but this was not accepted by other writers. The following year, the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot (which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system) and the lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). The English zoologist William Alexander Forbes, believing that mascarinus was invalid as a specific name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879, in honour of Dubois."]}, {"page": "Frank Evers Beddard", "response": ["In 1884 he was appointed prosector, responsible for preparing dissections of animals that had died, at the Zoological Society of London, following the death of William Alexander Forbes."]}, {"page": "Forbes's plover", "response": ["This species was named for the British zoologist William Alexander Forbes."]}, {"page": "William Forbes", "response": ["*William Alexander Forbes (1855\u20131883), English zoologist"]}, {"page": "Grey-backed storm petrel", "response": ["The genus Garrodia was created by William Alexander Forbes in 1881 and named after English zoologist Alfred Henry Garrod,Jobling (2010), p. 171. while the specific descriptor is an allusion to the Nereids, the sea nymphs of Greek mythology.Jobling (2010), p. 268."]}, {"page": "Forbes's blackbird", "response": ["Forbes's blackbird (Anumara forbesi) is an endangered species of New World blackbird that is endemic to the Atlantic forest in South America.

Fowlie source claims that the moth was first discovered by a missionary in the 1880s and subsequently the moth found its way into Humboldt's collection in 1882. All other sources, however, accredit Rothschild and Jordan as the discoverers. This confirmed Darwin's prediction. The moth was named Xanthopan morganii praedicta.  It is possible that the subspecific epithet praedicta was given in honor of the fact that Darwin predicted its existence, but there is no reference to Darwin in the paper that described the moth. A more conservative explanation is simply that the existence of the moth had been predicted and widely accepted before it was discovered.left|thumb|160px|Original drawing included in first publication of A.\u00a0sesquipedale by Thouars. In 1873 William Alexander Forbes wrote an article in the journal Nature asking readers if they knew of the moth predicted by Darwin. A reply to the question was first made that same year by Hermann M\u00fcller. He announced that his brother Fritz M\u00fcller had discovered a moth with a proboscis of  long, but it was discovered in Brazil and so was not a candidate for pollinating A.\u00a0sesquipedale. Although Darwin learned of M\u00fcller's finding he did not live to see the discovery of Xanthopan morganii. Even after the 1903 discovery however, news of Xanthopan morganii praedicta was not immediately disseminated. A second inquiry into the existence of the pollinator moth was made in the 30 January 1907 issue of the journal Nature by E. W. Swanton. Presumably still unaware of Rothschild and Jordan's discovery, Wallace responded stating that he didn't know of a suitable pollinator in Madagascar, but that he had heard of one from East Africa with a long enough proboscis."]}, {"page": "Alfred Henry Garrod", "response": ["In 1881, William Alexander Forbes named the genus Garrodia for the grey-backed storm petrel in honour of Alfred Garrod."]}, {"page": "Kensington School", "response": ["*William Alexander Forbes (1855-1883) - zoologist"]}, {"page": "William A.
