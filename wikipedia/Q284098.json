Subject panels in physics, chemistry, biology and general science developed new syllabi for 'O' and 'A' levels which were presented to the Secondary Schools Examination Council in 1960.Brian E. Woolnough, Physics Teaching in Schools, 1960\u201385: Of People, Policy, and Power, Studies in Curriculum History 8, London/New York: Falmer, 1988, , pp.\u00a087\u201388.

The latter came under criticism from HM Inspectorate as it suggested dogmatic teaching.\" and a year's practical trial of the material was conducted in 30 schools. The subcommittee then invited representatives from government and the Institutes of Physics and Chemistry to a meeting in August 1961 at Barrow Court, where the consensus was that outside funding should be sought for a full process to develop curricula and teaching materials.Woolnough, pp.\u00a088\u201390. The Nuffield Foundation had also been investigating the problem, and sponsored a meeting at Battersea College of Technology hosted by the Head of Physics, Lewis Elton, in April 1961, and also consulted John Lewis, the senior science master at Malvern College, who had been involved at all stages in the Association's Subcommittee and had been impressed by the science teaching he had seen in a tour of Russia.Woolnough, p. 93. The hope was to improve British science teaching, and hence British industry, \"by persuasion\" where Russia had done so \"by compulsion\".Ronald W. Clark, A Biography of the Nuffield Foundation, London: Longman, 1972, , p.\u00a0171.Concern for the competitiveness of British industry was widespread at the time; in 1963 Harold Wilson made a speech urging improvements to education so that Britain would not be disadvantaged in the \"white heat of the technological revolution\"; cited in Alan Peacock, \"The Emergence of Primary Science\", in Amos and Boohan, eds., Teaching Science, pp.\u00a071\u201381, p.\u00a071. This was also an international concern, with science teaching reform in the US acquiring added impetus after Sputnik; Donnelly and Jenkins, p.\u00a028. In December the Nuffield Foundation agreed to fund the effort to improve science education in England and Wales, building on the Science Masters Association's work, but on its own terms, with an initial commitment of \u00a3250,000 for three working groups to develop outlines, textbooks, teachers' guides and classroom equipment for the teaching of physics, chemistry and biology to pupils aged 11\u201315, and the Minister of Education, Sir David Eccles, announced the plan in the House of Commons on 4\u00a0April 1962.Clark, pp. 170\u201371.Woolnough, pp. 94\u201395.Mary Waring, Social Pressures and Curriculum Innovation: A Study of the Nuffield Foundation Science Teaching Project, London: Methuen, 1979, , pp.\u00a02\u20133, 82\u201385.James F.
