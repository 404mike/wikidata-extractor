He was one of four Snowdown Colliery players to join Coventry at that time, on the recommendation of former Coventry captain Harry Barratt who had become manager of the Kent club, the others being Alf Bentley, Eric Jones and Bill Patrick. Curtis made his debut for the Coventry reserve team in a Football Combination fixture against Southampton on 10 December 1955 at the age of 16. He made his first-team league debut on 21 April 1956, playing in a 4\u20132 defeat against Newport County at Somerton Park. Coventry were competing in the Football League Third Division South, which was at that time the third tier of the English football league system. Playing at left-back at the time, Coventry Evening Telegraph reporter Derek Henderson, writing under the byline \"Nemo\", wrote that Curtis had a \"memorable\" first game, and that \"after a shaky opening [he] settled down to give a splendid showing after the interval\". Curtis was then called up to the England national under-18 team in May 1956, making his debut in a match against Northern Ireland in Belfast. He went to make three more appearances for England, the last coming in 1957."]}, {"page": "Bill Patrick", "response": ["Bill Patrick may refer to:", "*Bill Patrick (cricketer) (1885\u20131946), New Zealand cricketer", "*Bill Patrick (footballer) (born 1932), Scottish association football player", "*Bill Patrick (sports anchor) (born 1955), sports anchor for NHL on Versus and NBC Sports", "*Bill Patrick (Canadian politician)"]}]}}
