About 70 camps were established in 1933, in any convenient structure that could hold prisoners, including vacant factories, prisons, country estates, schools, workhouses, and castles. Many sites were reused as Nazi detention facilities later on. There was no national system; camps were operated by local police, SS, and SA, state interior ministries, or a combination of the above. The early camps in 1933\u20131934 were heterogenous and unlike those created in and after 1936, in fundamental aspects such as organization, conditions, and the groups imprisoned. Therefore, researchers have begun to call them \"early camps\" rather than \"concentration camps\". Although the camps were not sites of routine killings, their unprecedented violence marked the end of the Weimar Republic."]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 612 || Nazi Germany || Jane Caplan ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Detlev Peukert", "response": ["In 2017, the British historian Jane Caplan approvingly quoted Peukert's remarks about how best to confront fascism as still relevant today, citing his statement from Inside Nazi Germany: \"The values we should assert [in response to fascism] are easily stated but hard to practise: reverence for life, pleasure in diversity and contrariety, respect for what is alien, tolerance for what is unpalatable, scepticism about the feasibility and desirability of chiliastic schemes for a global new order, openness towards others and a willingness to learn even from those who call into question one's own principles of social virtue.\"", "* \u201cThe Genesis of the `Final Solution\u2019 from the Spirit of Science\u201d pages 234-252 from Reevaluating the Third Reich edited by Thomas Childers and Jane Caplan, New York: Holmes & Meier, 1994 .
