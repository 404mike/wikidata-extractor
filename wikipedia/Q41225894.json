Gannon started off well, taking the team to the Cheshire Senior Cup final and up to ninth in the table with a sequence of seven games unbeaten, including five victories, in the run up to Easter. In December he signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract. County finished eighth in the 2016\u201317 season, one point outside the play-offs. Gannon was credited with turning around the career of Danny Lloyd, who signed for Peterborough United in May 2017, 12 months after Gannon had persuaded him to play for County rather than quit the game altogether. Gannon said that he was pleased with his defence, but wanted to overhaul the attacking side so as to reach the play-offs the following season. He achieved his aim as Stockport qualified for the play-offs with a fifth-place finish in the 2017\u201318 campaign, before losing 1\u20130 to Chorley in the qualifying round. Following the defeat he sold 22-year-old midfielder James Ball to Stevenage for an undisclosed five-figure fee."]}, {"page": "Daniel Lloyd", "response": ["*Danny Lloyd (born 1972), American child actor", "*Danny Lloyd (footballer) (born 1991), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 National League", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Danny Lloyd"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Peterborough United F.C. season", "response": ["|10||Danny Lloyd||AM||||Liverpool||||40||13||Stockport County||1 July 2017||Free||2020", "|10||||AM||Danny Lloyd-McGoldrick     ||8||3||0||2||13", "|10||||AM||Danny Lloyd-McGoldrick         ||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||0", "| 1 July 2017 || CF ||  || Danny Lloyd || Stockport County || Free || "]}]}}
