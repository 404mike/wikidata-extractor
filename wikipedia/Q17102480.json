He even says, \"[although] she has done more and done better than other women writers, it has not been her whole employment \u2014 she is not looking out for admiration and talking to show off.\" In addition to Jane Austen, Henrietta O'Neill, Reverend Joseph Cooper Walker, and Sarah Rose were people Smith considered trusted friends. After becoming famous for marrying into a great Irish home, Henrietta O'Neill, like Austen, provided Smith \"with a poetic, sympathetic friendship and with literary connections.\" Henrietta helped her gain an \"entry into a fashionable, literary world to which she otherwise had little access; here she almost certainly met Dr. Moore (author of A View of Society and Manners in Italy and Zeluco) and Lady Londonderry, among others.", "One of Smith's longest friends and respected mentors was Reverend Joseph Cooper Walker, an antiquarian and writer of Dublin. \"Walker handled her dealings with John Rice, who published Dublin editions of many of her works. She confided openly in Walker about literary and familial matters.\" Through the publication of personal letters Smith sent to a close companion, Sarah Rose, readers are shown a far more positive and joyful side to Smith. Although today his writing is seen as mediocre, William Hayley, another friend of Smith's, was \"liked, respected, influential\" during their time, especially as he was offered the laureateship upon the death of Thomas Warton.\" As time went on, Hayley Smith withdrew his support from her in 1794 and corresponded with her infrequently after that. Smith perceived Hayley's actions as betrayal; he would often make claims that she was a \"Lady of signal sorrows, signal woes.\" Even with her success as a writer and handful of accredited friends throughout her lifetime Smith was \"sadly isolated from other writers and literary friends.\" Although many believed Hayley's statements to be true, many saw Smith as a \"woman of signal achievement, energy, ambition, devotion, and sacrifice. Her children and her literary career evoked from her best efforts, and did so in about equal measure.\""]}, {"page": "Turlough O'Carolan", "response": ["* Joseph Cooper Walker: Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards (Dublin, 1786)."]}, {"page": "Joseph Walker", "response": ["*Joseph Cooper Walker (1762\u20131810), Irish antiquary and writer"]}, {"page": "Irish music collecting", "response": ["The next collection was Wright's Aria di Camera (1730).

She was part of the first generation of the Protestant Anglo-Irish settler class who took a strong interest in the Irish language and Gaelic history; her primary interest in Irish language and literature was generated by her hearing it being spoken and recited by the laborers in County Cavan and on the County Kildare estates where her family had moved around 1758. She was led to the study of the Irish language, and in less than two years she found herself in love with it. From reading Irish poetry and admiring its beauties, she proceeded to translate it into English, one of her earliest efforts being a song and monody by Carolan, which appeared in Joseph Cooper Walker's 'Historical Memoirs of Irish Bards.'"]}, {"page": "Anne Bannerman", "response": ["Bannerman's early work was published, often pseudonymously, in periodicals, notably the Monthly Magazine, the Poetical Register, and the Edinburgh Magazine, the latter of which was edited by her friend and supporter, Dr Robert Anderson. She was read and admired by Thomas Park, James Currie, Bishop Thomas Percy, Anne Grant, and antiquary Joseph Cooper Walker. Her first volume, Poems (1800), was well regarded but did not sell well. It contains a series of odes, original sonnets, a sonnet series translated from Petrarch, and another based on The Sorrows of Werther. In these two latter Bannerman developed Joanna Baillie's theory of dramatic composition \u2014 her stated intent to focus on the progress of one master passion \u2014 and applied it to poetry. Her second collection, Tales of Superstition and Chivalry (1802) was published anonymously. It consisted of ten Gothic ballads and four engravings and did not fare so well with reviewers, in part because of her penchant for the strain of obscurity and ambiguity within the Gothic tradition.Adriana Craciun, Fatal Women of Romanticism (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2003), 156. Her ballads were, however, praised by Walter Scott.Walter Scott, \"Essay on imitations of the ancient ballad,\" Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (1830). Rev. and ed. T.F. Henderson.

C. Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards, Payne, 1786, p.134 Despite the lack of a text, Walker's assertion was repeated by, amongst others, Renehan and W. H. Grattan Flood: Flood however proposed (based on a suggestion by Lynch in a letter to the Dublin Penny Journal) the air must refer to an earlier statute of the 13th century. The story inspired a 19th-century patriotic poem called The Coulin Forbidden, written by W. B. McBurney under the pseudonym \"Carroll Malone\"."]}]}}
