He was born at George Street, Glasgow on 18 December 1853. His father was John Wellwood, a commission agent, and his mother was Margaret Thomson. He was educated at Annfield School, Bridgeton, Glasgow and at the University of Glasgow. He chose the Church of Scotland instead of the United Presbyterian Church of which his parents were members, mainly because it \"offered more scope for freedom and breadth of thought.\" After he was licensed by the Presbytery of Glasgow, he served as an assistant Minister at Auchterderran, at Glasgow Cathedral, and at Campbeltown. He was ordained on 5 April 1883 and immediately became minister in the parish of Drainie in the Presbytery of Elgin. Besides poetry, his interests included Liberal politics and musical composition and he composed several hymn tunes. On 26 April 1883, he married Isabella Herkless, the only daughter of William Herkless, Glasgow and the sister of Sir John Herkless, Principal of St. Andrews University. They had five sons and two daughters. Two of their sons were officers in Scottish regiments who died in action during the 1914-18 War. Wellwood remained Minister at Drainie till his death on 7 February 1919. The untimely death of his two sons contributed to his demise.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norman Macleod (minister, born 1812)", "response": ["* John Wellwood (1897), Norman Macleod, Edinburgh: Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier, (\"Famous Scots Series\")."]}, {"page": "List of books for the \"Famous Scots Series\"", "response": ["|John Wellwood"]}, {"page": "Dean of Raphoe", "response": ["*1661\u20131670 John Wellwood"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish poets", "response": ["*John Wellwood"]}, {"page": "Wellwood, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Wellwood"]}]}}
