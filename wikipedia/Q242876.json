He specifically adopted Windsor as the surname for all descendants of Queen Victoria then living in Britain, excluding women who married into other families and their descendants. He and his relatives who were British subjects relinquished the use of all German titles and styles, and adopted English surnames. George compensated several of his male relatives by creating them British peers. Thus, his cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, became the Marquess of Milford Haven, while his brother-in-law, the Duke of Teck, became the Marquess of Cambridge. Others, such as Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, simply stopped using their territorial designations. The system for titling members of the royal family was also simplified.Nicolson (195), p 310 Relatives of the British royal family who fought on the German side were simply cut off; their British peerages were suspended by a 1919 Order in Council under the provisions of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917."]}, {"page": "Marie Louise", "response": ["*Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein (1872\u20131956), daughter of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Helena of the United Kingdom, wife of Prince Aribert of Anhalt"]}, {"page": "Princess Marie", "response": ["* Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein (1872\u20131956), member of the British Royal Family"]}, {"page": "Marie of Saxe-Altenburg", "response": ["On 18 September 1872, Queen Marie was godmother to Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein.
