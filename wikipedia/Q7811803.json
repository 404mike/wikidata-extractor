He is known for his work on the Manchester comedy circuit, where he performs regularly, and as a prominent fan of the television series Doctor Who. He runs the XS Malarkey comedy club, and is involved with many comedy nights in the region.  His comedy tends towards the topical and/or political.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "State of Decay (Doctor Who)", "response": ["For Radio Times, Mark Braxton awarded State of Decay four stars out of five, writing that \"Terrance Dicks's penultimate script for Doctor Who positively gushes with invention and wit. In fact, it's among his cleverest, and gives an already striking season 18 a tremendous shot in the arm.\" He considered it \"a throwback to the Hinchcliffe/Holmes golden age, played with a totally straight bat and all the better for it.\" He regarded it as \"gorgeously designed\" and the \"vampiric triumvirate\" as \"wonderfully cast\", and \"one of Tom Baker's finest outings\", saying there was an \"on-screen rapport\" between him and Lalla Ward which was \"charming and relaxed\". He found some faults, stating that \"some effectively chilly location filming at Burnham Beeches notwithstanding, the bats are a bit lame, rendered by stock footage, cut-outs dangled from a string or a tinkling electronic noise. Despite their simmering menace, Aukon, Camilla and Zargo are all threat and no bite, swishing about with some bizarrely stagey movements. And the Great One is a gloved hand.\" However, he concluded by stating that it was \"supremely atmospheric, solid of script and with potent production values.\" Writing for The Guardian in 2019, Toby Hadoke described it as \"a clever meld of vampire legend and science fiction\". In Doctor Who: The Complete Guide, Mark Campbell was less impressed, awarding it six out of ten, describing it as a \"limply directed vampire tale that doesn't really gel \u2013 the horror should be more explicit, the vampirism more obvious. One feels the production team deliberately didn't want to plagiarise Hammer, which, considering the Hammeresque script, seems a mistake.\""]}, {"page": "Quatermass and the Pit", "response": ["A Blu-ray edition was released in 2018 to mark the show's 60th anniversary.

The A.V. Club's Christopher Bahn was critical of the pacing of the end of the story and the \"often unconvincing\" special effects, but considered the serial to be, despite some flaws, \"a classic base-under-siege chiller\". Writing for The Guardian in 2019, Toby Hadoke described it as \"a claustrophobic masterpiece dripping with mordant humour and suspense\". For Den of Geek, Andrew Blair wrote that Leela's line \"you will do as the Doctor says or I will cut out your heart\" was his favourite Leela moment, adding that \"what makes this scene even funnier is that the camera immediately cuts to the Doctor, who bursts into a massive grin.\" "]}, {"page": "The 7th Dimension", "response": ["The 7th Dimension is the BBC's regular radio slot for science fiction, fantasy and horror.

Bulloch's half-brother, Robert Watts, who was working as an associate producer for Empire, was tasked with finding someone who \"would fit in the costume of Boba Fett.\" So Watts called Bulloch (who at the time was working on Agony) and encouraged him to see Tiny Nicholls, the wardrobe supervisor and Bulloch had a costume fitting as Boba Fett, which \"took 20 minutes to put on.\""]}, {"page": "List of Doctor Who audio releases", "response": ["DVD-style audio commentaries released on CD/download, without the original episode audio.

Letts later provided an official obituary for Sloman in December 2005, published in The Guardian. Letts was a Buddhist and also held liberal political views.
