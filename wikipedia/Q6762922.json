She was best known for her performances of songs such as \"The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery\", \"My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)\" and \"Oh Mr Porter What Shall I Do\". She received both criticism and praise for her use of innuendo and double entendre during her performances, but enjoyed a long and prosperous career, during which she was affectionately called the \"Queen of the Music Hall\".\nBorn in London, she was showcased by her father at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton. In 1884, she made her professional d\u00e9but as Bella Delmere; she changed her stage name to Marie Lloyd the following year. In 1885, she had success with her song \"The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery\", and she frequently topped the bill at prestigious theatres in London's West End. In 1891, she was recruited by the impresario Augustus Harris to appear in that year's spectacular Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Christmas pantomime Humpty Dumpty. She starred in a further two productions at the theatre, Little Bo Peep (1892) and Robinson Crusoe (1893). By the mid-1890s, Lloyd was in frequent dispute with Britain's theatre censors due to the risqu\u00e9 content of her songs.\nBetween 1894 and 1900, she became an international success when she toured France, America, Australia and Belgium with her solo music hall act. In 1907, she assisted other performers during the music hall war and took part in demonstrations outside theatres, protesting for better pay and conditions for performers. During the First World War, in common with most other music hall artists, she supported recruitment into the armed services to help the war effort, touring hospitals and industrial institutions to help boost morale. In 1915, she performed her only wartime song \"Now You've Got Your Khaki On\", which became a favourite among front-line troops.\nLloyd had a turbulent private life that was often the subject of press attention: she was married three times, divorced twice, and frequently found herself giving court testimony against two of her husbands who had physically abused her. In later life, she was still in demand at music halls and had a late success in 1919 with her performance of \"My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)\", which became one of her most popular songs. Privately, she suffered from bouts of ill-health and became alcohol-dependent, both of which imposed restrictions on her performing career by the 1920s. In 1922, she gave her final performance at the Alhambra Theatre, London, during which she became ill on stage. She died a few days later at the age of 52.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 12", "response": ["*1870 \u2013 Marie Lloyd, English actress and singer (d. 1922)"]}, {"page": "1870", "response": ["** Marie Lloyd, English singer (d. 1922)"]}, {"page": "1922", "response": ["* October 7 \u2013 Marie Lloyd, British singer (b. 1870)"]}, {"page": "Double entendre", "response": ["In the UK, starting in the 19th century, Victorian morality disallowed sexual innuendo in the theatre as being unpleasant, particularly for the ladies in the audience.

In the early 20th century restrictions were placed on lewdness in performances, including some prosecutions. It was the job of the Lord Chamberlain to examine the scripts of all plays for indecency. Nevertheless, some comedians still continued to get away with it. Max Miller had two books of jokes, a white book and a blue book, and would ask his audience which book they wanted to hear stories from. If they chose the blue book, he could blame the audience for the lewdness to follow (in the UK, \"blue\" colloquially refers to sexual content, as in \"blue jokes\", \"blue movies\" etc.)."]}, {"page": "Brockley", "response": ["* Marie Lloyd, music hall singer; lived at 196 Wickham Terrace in 1891-2"]}, {"page": "Dalston", "response": ["Music hall artist Marie Lloyd (1870\u20131922) used to reside on Graham Road.

The new urban communities, cut off from their cultural roots, required new and accessible means of entertainment. Music halls were originally bars, which provided entertainment in the form of music and speciality acts for their patrons. By the middle years of the 19th century, the first purpose-built music halls were being built in London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that could no longer be met from the traditional folk repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap. By the turn of the century, music hall was dominated by song writing companies and theatre chains, such as that of Sir Oswald Stoll.M. R. Booth and J. H. Kaplan, ed., The Edwardian Theatre Essays on Performance and the Stage (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 62.  Music hall songs are characterised by a simple beat and a strong melody or tune, which can be easily acquired by the audience. Typically, a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone and a repeated chorus, which carries the principal melody and in which the audience is encouraged to join.

Lloyd's repertoire, which included songs such as The Costermonger's Song, unlike other music hall compositions, was less dependent on the ability of the performer to mimic Cockney accents and mannerisms, but rather relied on the lyrics to deliver a \"quaintness of fancy\" and humour.Matthews, W., \"Cockney in the Music Halls,\" Chapter 5 in Cockney Past and Present: A Short History of the Dialect of London, Routledge, 2015 Other musicians, such as Robert and Harris Weston, drew inspiration from London's cockney culture when composing their songs, some of which were often sung in a cockney accent. Coster life and culture was also portrayed in Victorian music halls by vocal comedians such as Albert Chevalier, Bessie Bellwood, Charles Seel, Paul Mill and Gus Elen. Elen was a highly popular performer whose tunes included; The Coster's Mansion, The Coster's Muvver and The Coster's Pony. Chevalier, was a popular comedic entertainer, who himself never worked as a coster, but appeared in character as a costermonger, and sang The Coster's Serenade, The Nasty Way 'e Sez It, and Funny Without Being Vulgar.
