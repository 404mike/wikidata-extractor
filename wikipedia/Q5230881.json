His political career spanned over twenty years, starting in 1968 as a local Conservative councillor for Hammersmith (Greater London) where he was Chairman for Housing and then progressing as a Conservative Councillor for the Greater London Council (GLC) representing Eltham from 1977 to 1981. While at the GLC (subsequently dissolved under Margaret Thatcher's government in 1986), he was Chairman of Housing and Management and campaigned fervently for a fairer system of council house distribution by moving power to the boroughs and decentralising. In 1983 he was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Leicestershire NW, seen as a marginal seat. He was a back-bench MP under both the Thatcher and the Major governments and sat on many committees including the Home Affairs and Freedom of Information committees.During the \"Back to Basics\" campaign run in 1994 by the Major government, Ashby came under media scrutiny after his wife claimed that during a trip he had shared a hotel bed with another man supposedly due to the unavailability of a twin-bedded room.Ashby refused to name the other man concerned, but later stated he was seeking legal advice about newspaper articles that reported his wife as saying that Ashby had left her for another man, attributing his marriage breakdown instead to the long hours in Parliament and to a growing rift between them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|David Ashby"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: A", "response": ["* David Ashby MP for North West Leicestershire (1983\u20131997)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|David Ashby"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|David Ashby"]}, {"page": "North West Leicestershire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The constituency was created in 1983, and first won by the Conservative David Ashby.

Taylor had already announced that he would stand down at the 2010 general election. With the next election being due on 6 May 2010, it was considered uneconomic and (based on precedent) unnecessary to arrange a by-election. In the 2010 election, Andrew Bridgen took the seat for the Conservatives, with a swing of 12% from Labour to the Conservatives and with a smaller Lab-LD swing.
