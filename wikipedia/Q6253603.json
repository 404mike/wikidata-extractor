The French acoustic physicist Joseph Sauveur, a non-musician, researched musical pitches and determined their frequencies. He found several frequency values for A4 as presented to him by musicians and their instruments, with A4 ranging from 405 to 421\u00a0Hz. (Other contemporary researchers such as Christiaan Huygens, Vittorio Francesco Stancari and Brook Taylor were finding similar and lower values for A4, as low as 383\u00a0Hz.) In 1701, Sauveur proposed that all musical pitches should be based on a son fixe (fixed sound), that is, one unspecified note set to 100\u00a0Hz, from which all others would be derived. In 1713, Sauveur changed his proposal to one based on C4 set to 256\u00a0Hz; this was later called \"philosophical pitch\" or \"Sauveur pitch\". Sauveur's push to standardize a concert pitch was strongly resisted by the musicians with whom he was working, and the proposed standard was not adopted. The notion was revived periodically, including by mathematician Sir John Herschel and composer John Pyke Hullah in the mid-19th century, but never established as a standard."]}, {"page": "Edwin George Monk", "response": ["Monk studied in Bath and London under George MacFarren (theory), John Pyke Hullah (singing) and Henry Philips (singing).
