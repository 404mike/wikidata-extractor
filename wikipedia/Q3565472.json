He was brought in with fellow Newport forward Wallace Watts, and the two were selected to play in the same squad on ten occasions. The Welsh team were beaten soundly by England, and failed to win any of the games in that season's Championship. The next season Boucher played his role in winning Wales's very first Triple Crown, and by 1897 he had collected 13 caps, missing two games in between only due to injuries. In his final game for Wales against England, Boucher scored his first and only try for his country, and due to the Gould Affair Wales played no further games that season."]}, {"page": "William Llewellyn Thomas", "response": ["Thomas first played for Newport in the 1893/94 season, and in December 1893 was part of the Newport team that faced the Barbarians.

Thomas was later selected for the national side as part of the 1894 Home Nations Championship. Brought in as a replacement for Cardiff's Norman Biggs, Thomas was part of a three-quarters with team mate and Wales' captain 'Monkey' Gould, and Cardiff pairing Tom Pearson and Dai Fitzgerald. Despite a heavy defeat by England a month earlier, the Welsh selectors kept faith with majority of the team, so Thomas and Fitzgerald were the only two new caps. The Scottish attempted a half-hearted trial of the four three-quarter system, which did not prove fruitful; Wales won the game 7\u20130."]}, {"page": "Frank Mills (rugby union)", "response": ["Although Mills originally played for Mountain Ash,Mountain Ash RFC, club history he came to note as a rugby player when he represented first-class club Swansea, which he joined in 1892.

Three, Tom Deacon and John and David Samuel, were from Swansea RFC; with Nicholl taking the remaining position. Played at Stradey Park, the game was only decided by a goal conversion from Billy Bancroft, giving Wales the victory and Ireland the wooden spoon. From that match, Nicholl became a regular fixture in the Welsh pack. Of his 15 caps for Wales he only missed one international match over a 16-game run, taking in five Home Nations Championships. Most notably, Nicholls was part of the 1893 team which saw Wales not only win the Championship, but lift the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. The next year's tournament saw Nicholl play the first two matches against England and Scotland, but then miss the final game away to Ireland, his place taken by Neath's Fred Hutchinson. Nicholl played in all three matches of the 1895 Championship, but 1896 saw a shift in the selection tactics employed by the Welsh Rugby Union. After a humiliating defeat by England in the opening game of the 1896 Championship the selectors decided to discard many of the forward players who had served Wales over the past four seasons, including Triple Crown winners like Wallace Watts and Arthur Boucher, favouring a new type of player emerging from the South Wales coalfields. Dubbed the 'Rhondda forward', these players were selected from tough manual workers who could not only scrummage and jump, but could take and respond to a more physical game. Although a product of the university system, Nicholl was well known for his hard style of play, and survived until the end of the season but was replaced by Llwynypia's Dick Hellings in 1897."]}]}}
