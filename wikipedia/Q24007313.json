Jordan and the Welsh defender David Jones went to challenge for the ball in the Welsh penalty area, from a throw-in by Scotland midfielder Asa Hartford. The referee decided Jones had handled the ball, and awarded Scotland a penalty, although TV replays later showed that it was in fact Jordan's hand which made contact with the ball (and also that he kissed his hand once the penalty was awarded). The penalty was converted, and the eventual 2\u20130 win for Scotland secured qualification by winning UEFA Group 7. He was selected by Ally MacLeod in the Scotland squad for the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. Jordan scored the opening goal in their first match against Peru, but Scotland went on to lose 3\u20131. Scotland again failed to qualify beyond the group stage, after a 1\u20131 draw with Iran and a 3\u20132 win against the Netherlands."]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players", "response": ["|David Jones"]}, {"page": "David Jones (footballer born 1952)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Jones (footballer, born 1952)"]}, {"page": "AFC Bournemouth Under-21s and Academy", "response": ["| 1969 ||  David Jones|| Centre-back|| ?
