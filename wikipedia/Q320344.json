For many years it was thought to have been copied by Francis Tregian the Younger during his incarceration in Fleet Prison from about 1608 until his death in 1618. Based on a physical analysis of the manuscript (and an analysis of writings on Tregian), Ruby Reid Thompson has shown that not only is this attribution extremely unlikely, but that the basis for the belief of Tregian's to the manuscript was also very tenuous.Since Ruby Reid Thompson's work appeared in print, a number of scholars have argued in favour of the traditional view that the music in Drexel 4302 and the other relevant sources mentioned below were copied by one scribe, namely Francis Tregian the Younger.
