He was the founder of his branding agency Lambie-Nairn and was the creative director of branding agency ML-N. He is recognised for having redefined television brand identity design, being the first to embrace computer technologies to apply branding to screen-based media.\nLambie-Nairn was also a co-creator of 1980s satirical puppet show Spitting Image. Amongst his most prominent works are the original Channel 4 logo and idents created in 1982, the batch of over 30 idents for BBC Two that first aired on 16 February 1991, the 1997 corporate re-brand for the whole BBC, and the 2008 BBC Regional News titles.

The logo was designed by Martin Lambie-Nairn and his partner Colin Robinson and was the first channel in the UK to depict an ident made using advanced computer generation (the first electronically generated ident was on BBC2 in 1979, but this was two-dimensional). It was designed in conjunction with Bo Gehring Aviation of Los Angeles and originally depicted the \"4\" in red, yellow, green, blue and purple. The music accompanying the ident was called \"Fourscore\" and was composed by David Dundas; it was later released as a single alongside a B-side, \"Fourscore Two\", although neither reached the UK charts. In November 1992, \"Fourscore\" was replaced by new music."]}, {"page": "S4C", "response": ["On 1 June 1993, S4C introduced a new series of idents, which depicted inanimate objects as having characteristics of dragons (such as flight or breathing fire), as a reference to the red dragon on the flag of Wales.

What he noticed, was that the BBC had a system that meant that every service or department had a different logo scheme. It had a BBC logo and the name with character. Lambie-Nairn decided to address this when he took on the project, as with all these logos, the core brand itself was severely weakened. It was also appropriate to look at the way the BBC was branded, as the BBC was about to take off in digital television and the internet, among other different ventures. After seeing a number of problems with the then-current logo, he decided that a new logo was necessary. The logo was technically unsuitable on-screen. When shrunk, it lost the lines underneath and the counters (the sections in the Bs) and also, when in colour on a colour photo, it again disappeared or parts vanished. Also, on a TV or computer, diagonals are difficult to work with as the logos pixelate, and anti-aliasing is required to make the logo work. The previous logo also followed the idea of the slanted boxes, and related the BBC back to the very first logo in the 1950s and 1960s, which was not what the corporation wanted at that time. Technically, the logo never looked comfortable next to the brand and straight letters. Finally, it was expensive to print as stationery would always have four-colour letterheads, and alongside other BBC brands could mean anything up to ten-colour letterheads and stationery."]}, {"page": "BBC Two 'Personality' idents", "response": ["Throughout the 1990s, the programming of BBC Two was gradually evolving from factual programming to more light-hearted programming. As a result, the channel's identity at the time was starting to appear alienated - some of the longer-running idents like 'Steam', 'Diary', 'Silk' and 'Copper Cut-Out' were retired at the end of 1999 to combat this, with newer, more appropriate idents like 'Catalyst', 'Excalibur', 'Kebab', 'Predator', 'Wave Day', 'Wave Night', and 'Woodpecker' being introduced as a replacement at the start of 2000. However, by 2001, the channel's programming had evolved to a point where it was primarily entertainment-based, and this was seen as completely incompatible with idents that had, at that point, been regularly airing for as long as a decade. It was eventually decided that the channel's identity would need to be changed on a much larger scale in order to fit in with its evolved schedule; one that would equal the popularity of the previous identity, but also to be more light-hearted and appropriate to fit in with the channel's new programming. Martin Lambie-Nairn, the designer of the previous identity, was recalled to create an entirely new identity: the result was that the '2' from before was retained, but it was now anthropomorphised."]}, {"page": "2020 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Martin Lambie-Nairn, 75, British Graphic Designer.
