The clock-tower featured the prow of a Viking longship, jutting out on each side as a reminder of Sweyn Forkbeard, thought to be the founder of Swansea. The council chamber used panelling made of Australian walnut and columns  high. Bronze busts depicting the local Members of Parliament, David Matthews, David Williams, Percy Morris and David Grenfell,  were subsequently installed outside the council chamber. Percy Thomas won the Bronze Medal for Architecture from the Royal Institute of British Architects for his work in 1935."]}, {"page": "David Matthews (Liberal politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Matthews (British politician)"]}]}}
