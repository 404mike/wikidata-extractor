He is best remembered for his role in the film Ben-Hur (1959), which earned him critical acclaim and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Clochemerle is a stark contrast to the usual kind of bleak and somewhat fatalistic Galton & Simpson comedies. The tone is a gentle departure from  the doom and gloom  and dark comedy of their Steptoe and Son and Hancock's Half Hour. Filmed on location in the charming village of Colombier-le-Vieux, in the department of Ard\u00e8che, south of Lyon, France, it starred Roy Dotrice, Wendy Hiller, Cyril Cusack, Kenneth Griffith, Cyd Hayman, Bernard Bresslaw, Hugh Griffith, Micheline Presle, Madeline Smith, Christian Roberts, Nigel Green, Wolfe Morris and Gordon Rollings, with narration by Peter Ustinov. The show produced by Michael Mills was made as a co-production between Britain's BBC and West Germany's Bavaria Film. Incidental music was arranged by Alan Roper and played by L'Harmonie Du Rhone Orchestra, Lyon, under the musical direction of Raymond Jarniat."]}, {"page": "Richard Burton", "response": ["Burton went on to perform in Henry V as the titular character, and played Ferdinand in The Tempest as a part of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre season as well. Neither role was overwhelmingly received by the critics, with a reviewer saying \"he lacked inches\" as Henry V. Olivier defended Burton by retaliating that he too received the same kind of review by the same critic for the same role. His last play in 1951 was as a musician named Orph\u00e9e in Jean Anouilh's Eurydice opposite Dorothy McGuire and fellow Welsh actor Hugh Griffith. The play, retitled as Legend of Lovers, opened in the Plymouth Theatre, New York City and ran for only a week, but critics were kind to Burton, with Bob Francis of Billboard magazine finding him \"excellent as the self-tortured young accordionist\"."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Hugh Griffith (1912\u20131980)"]}, {"page": "Louis XVI", "response": ["King Louis XVI has been portrayed in numerous films. In Captain of the Guard (1930), he is played by Stuart Holmes. In Marie Antoinette (1938), he was played by Robert Morley. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Balmer portrayed him in the 1989 two-part miniseries La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise. More recently, he was depicted in the 2006 film Marie Antoinette by Jason Schwartzman. In Sacha Guitry's Si Versailles m'\u00e9tait cont\u00e9, Louis was portrayed by one of the film's producers, Gilbert Bokanowski, using the alias Gilbert Boka. Several portrayals have upheld the image of a bumbling, almost foolish king, such as that by Jacques Morel in the 1956 French film Marie-Antoinette reine de France and that by Terence Budd in the Lady Oscar live action film. In Start the Revolution Without Me, Louis XVI is portrayed by Hugh Griffith as a laughable cuckold. Mel Brooks played a comic version of Louis XVI in The History of the World Part 1, portraying him as a libertine who has such distaste for the peasantry he uses them as targets in skeet shooting. In the 1996 film Ridicule; Urbain Cancelier plays Louis."]}, {"page": "Jean Anouilh", "response": ["* Point of Departure (Eurydice). Duke of York's Theatre, London: 26 December 1950.

The producers did not anticipate that the trained animals for the production would be quarantined upon entering the United Kingdom, forcing replacement of the animals at considerable extra expense to meet deadlines. The producers chose to ignore reports of the area's frequently rainy summers, and the resulting weather continually interfered with shooting and caused health problems for the animals. All modern technologies such as cars, television antennas, and Coca-Cola promotional signs were removed or hidden, which irritated the population. An artificial dam built by the production was destroyed by British Army officer (and future explorer) Ranulph Fiennes because he believed it ruined the village. Budget woes continued to worsen in which production costs soared to $15\u00a0million. For the role of Albert Blossom, Richard Attenborough was hired at the last minute to replace Hugh Griffith during the shoot."]}, {"page": "Royal Academy of Dramatic Art", "response": ["* Hugh Griffith \u2013 (Ben-Hur, Oliver!)
