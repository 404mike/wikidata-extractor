He was a schoolmaster at the Catholic college in Preston and one of its first secretaries. As a player, he was renowned for testing his physical prowess against rival goalkeepers. Prior to the inauguration of the Football League, North End were anxious to prove their worth against the Corinthians. Preston won 3\u20131 at Kennington Oval and then 4\u20133 at Deepdale with Dewhurst netting a hat-trick.Dewhurst made his international debut in the 1885\u201386 British Home Championship match against Ireland and scored in a 6\u20131 win on 27 February 1886. He scored on 29 March 1886 in a 3\u20131 win against Wales. He played in all three 1886\u201387 British Home Championship matches against Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Dewhurst scored two goals against Scotland and one against Ireland. He played in all three 1887\u201388 British Home Championship matches against Ireland, Scotland and Wales, scoring a total of five goals with one against Ireland, two against Scotland and two against Wales. He scored in all but one of his nine international appearances for England.Dewhurst, playing as an inside forward, made his League debut on 8 September 1888 at Deepdale when the visitors were Burnley. The home team won 5\u20132 and Dewhurst scored the first and fifth of Preston's League goals. He appeared in 16 of Preston's 22 League Championship matches and scored twelve goals. He scored twice on three occasions: two against Burnley in the opening game, two in the 5\u20130 win over Derby County at Deepdale on 8 December 1888 and both goals in the 2\u20130 win against Aston Villa at Wellington Road on 9 February 1889. Dewhurst played in all five FA Cup ties and scored the opening goal in the final at Kennington Oval on 30 March 1889 when Preston defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 3\u20130.Dewhurst played only a minor role in Preston's successful defence of their League Championship title playing only six times and not scoring. He made his last first-team appearance in the 1890\u201391 season when he played in two matches, scoring one goal. He died in 1895 at the age of 31.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mount St Mary's College", "response": ["* Fred Dewhurst Preston North End footballer of the 1880s and 1890s"]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 in English football", "response": ["|23 Feb 1889|| Victoria Ground, Stoke-on-Trent ||align=left|  ||align=left| ||4\u20131||BHC||align=left| Billy Bassett (West Bromwich Albion), John Goodall (Preston North End), Jack Southworth (Blackburn Rovers) and Fred Dewhurst (Preston North End)"]}, {"page": "1885\u201386 in English football", "response": ["| Benjamin Spilsbury (Cambridge University) (4), Tinsley Lindley (Cambridge University) & Fred Dewhurst (Preston North End)", "|George Brann (Swifts), Fred Dewhurst (Preston North End) & Andrew Amos (Old Carthusians)"]}, {"page": "1886\u201387 in English football", "response": ["|Fred Dewhurst (Preston North End) (2 & 87 mins), William Cobbold (Cambridge University) (25 & 49 mins) & Tinsley Lindley (Cambridge University) (27, 43 & 52 mins)", "|Tinsley Lindley (Cambridge University) (32 mins) & Fred Dewhurst (Preston North End) (69 mins) "]}, {"page": "1887\u201388 in English football", "response": ["|Fred Dewhurst (Preston North End) (15 & 65 mins), George Woodhall (West Bromwich Albion) (70 mins), Tinsley Lindley (Cambridge University) (75 mins) & John Goodall (Preston North End) 88 mins) ", "|Tinsley Lindley (Cambridge University) (32 mins), Dennis Hodgetts (Aston Villa) (34 mins), Fred Dewhurst (Preston North End) (40 & 49 mins) & John Goodall (Preston North End) (43 mins) ", "|Fred Dewhurst (Preston North End) (10 mins), Albert Allen (Aston Villa)(14, 39 & 60 mins) & Tinsley Lindley (Cambridge University)"]}, {"page": "Tinsley Lindley", "response": ["It has been claimed that he holds the record for scoring in 9 consecutive England matches between 13 March 1886 and 7 April 1888.

By modern-day calculations, Derby County would have been the first ever table toppers because of their superior goal difference which was +3 after the first game.  Albion won 2\u20130 at Stoke in front of 4,500 spectators and would have headed Preston North End, Derby County and Everton by virtue of an infinite goal average as they kept a clean sheet. Goal Average was the number of goals scored divided by the number of goals conceded.  Goal Average was used to separate teams who were tied on points at that time. Preston defeated Burnley 5\u20132, Derby were 6\u20133 winners at Bolton and Everton secured the points in a 2\u20131 victory over Accrington. Aston Villa defender Gershom Cox was thought to have earned the distinction of scoring the first ever league goal with an unfortunate own goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Fred Dewhurst opening the scoring minutes later at Preston with the first intentional goal.
