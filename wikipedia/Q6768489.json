When she began playing for Thames Valley, she was considered a wicket-keeper with no more than average batting ability. At university, she began to develop her batting, playing alongside the men for her college side. The different pace and strength required in the men's game meant that she had to learn to play off the back foot, in contrast to women's cricket, which is generally played off the front foot. After graduating from university in 1997, she made her international debut for England in 1998, but batted low in the order for England, having been picked as a wicket-keeper. Intent on improving her batting, she began one-on-one coaching with Mark Lane. At the time, it was unusual for a member of the England women's team to have individual coaching sessions, and Taylor had to pay for the meetings herself. When they began working together, Lane was critical of her batting; \"She was just average, I would say.\" The sessions helped to improve Taylor's mental approach towards batting as well as making technical changes, though Lane promoted the use of bottom-handed hockey-style shots which came more naturally to Taylor. At her peak, she used her intelligence to help manipulate the field; in an interview she described that, \"when I'm batting at my best I have a 3D awareness of the shape of the field and where the spaces are.\""]}, {"page": "List of people from Aldershot", "response": ["* Mark Lane - cricketer and coach "]}, {"page": "Mark Lane (English cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Lane (cricketer, born 1968)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Mark Lane, cricket coach, was born in Aldershot"]}, {"page": "Sunrisers (women's cricket)", "response": ["* Spin Bowling Coach: Mark Lane"]}]}}
