Trewavas wrote that Keen's \"concern is the blurring of the distinction between the qualified and informed professional and the uninformed and unqualified amateur\", expressing concerns that this social change can hold back agricultural development. Trewavas stated as well, \"in agriculture, pesticides, food and farming, expert scientific knowledge and experience is seemingly regarded as having no more weight than that of the opinionated, unqualified (and inexperienced) environmentalist.\" The book has also been discussed in academic publications negatively, expressing how Keen has considered the worst aspects of a complex social movement while ignoring the demonstrable benefits that have been brought through initiatives such as OpenStreetMap, an expression of Volunteered Geographic Information.Parker, C.J., May, A.J. and Mitchell, V.
