Though she was paid for miniature copies of portraits, no known works survive in the Royal Collection. Her works follow the style of the popular court miniature painter Samuel Cooper. She was probably related to the artist Richard Carew (antiquary).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Miniature art", "response": ["* Anna Maria Carew (UK)"]}, {"page": "English Female Artists", "response": ["*Anna Maria Carew, Elizabeth Neale, Mary More, Mrs. Boardman, Elizabeth Creed"]}]}}
