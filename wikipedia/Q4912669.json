He began his career with his hometown side Bedlington United before moving to Scotland where he made his professional debut with Heart of Midlothian in 1910 at the age of 18. He remained with the side for a year, making sporadic appearances, before joining Football League Second Division side Stockport County. However, he made only one appearance for the first team. \nIn 1911, he joined Cardiff City along with his Stockport manager Fred Stewart where he quickly became established in the first team. Prior to World War I, he helped the side win their first Welsh Cup in 1912 and the Second Division of the Southern Football League a year later. After the war, he was part of the Cardiff side that joined the Football League in 1920 and won promotion to the Football League First Division in their first season. He remained a mainstay in the first team for seven more years in the First Division, helping the side finish as runners-up in the 1923\u201324 season and reach two FA Cup finals, in 1925 and 1927. In the latter, Cardiff became the first team from outside England to win the competition. \nHardy was appointed player-coach in 1930 and remained with the side until 1932 by which time Cardiff had been relegated to the Third Division South. He was released by the club after 21 years. He remains Cardiff's record appearance holder having featured in 590 matches in all competitions between 1911 and 1932. He took up a coaching position with Second Division Bradford Park Avenue before becoming manager of the side in 1934. He reverted to his coaching position after two years in charge after finishing in the bottom half of the table in each of his two seasons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Hardy", "response": ["Billy Hardy (born 5 September 1964 in Sunderland) is a former bantamweight and featherweight boxer champion.

Bradford PA permitted him to play for Kippax United in the Leeds League. Arsenal's secretary-manager George Allison heard of Shackleton's talents, and drove to Bradford to sign him to amateur forms in 1938. Arsenal permitted him to play for Enfield in the Athenian League, and he in fact only represented Arsenal twice in reserve team fixtures in the Southern League. He was released by Arsenal in May 1939 and told by Allison that he was too small to succeed as a footballer, and should find other employment. Following this disappointment he took a job at London Paper Mills in Dartford, and turned out for the factory's works team in the Kent League."]}, {"page": "Hardy (surname)", "response": ["*Billy Hardy, English boxer", "*Billy Hardy (footballer), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Fred Keenor", "response": ["His whole-hearted performances for the amateur side persuaded the club to offer Keenor his first professional contract. Although he was given a wage of 10 shillings per week, he continued to work locally as a labourer. He described his two streams of income as making him \"feel like a millionaire\". The Cardiff squad was undergoing a significant overhaul under the management team of secretary-manager Fred Stewart and trainer George Latham; all but four of the senior team players they had inherited from previous manager Davy McDougall were released. The pair were impressed by Keenor's performances and handed him first-team opportunities at the end of the 1912\u201313 season. Keenor featured in two friendly matches, a 9\u20130 victory over Bridgend YMCA, in which he scored, and a 1\u20131 draw with Mid Rhondda. The presence of Billy Hardy, Patrick Cassidy and Kidder Harvey, who became known as the \"holy three\" by fans, restricted his first-team opportunities as the trio ensured the club won promotion to the First Division of the Southern Football League after conceding just 15 goals during the campaign. Keenor was forced to wait until 6 December 1913 to make his competitive debut for the club, playing in a 1\u20131 draw with Exeter City in the First Division. He endured a difficult start and was described in a local newspaper report as \"the weak link in a very strong side\". He made just two further appearances for the side during the remainder of the 1913\u201314 season.

They went on to finish in fourth place in their first year in the league. The board decided to replace McDougall with Fred Stewart, who had previous managerial experience with Stockport County. He set about adopting a more professional approach, signing several players with Football League experience, including brothers John and George Burton and Billy Hardy.

They were open with the press about their tactics, saying they hoped to subdue Arsenal's attack by having Billy Hardy keep Buchan at bay. Hardy and Cardiff's defence were seen as a key part of the team's chances; ahead of the match, Buchan described them as \"an impassable barrier\". Cardiff were almost free to choose their first choice team. The only omission was Harry Wake who had suffered damage to his kidneys in a league match against Sheffield Wednesday a week before the final. Other than Wake, their team was the same as that which played Reading in the semi-final. Ernie Curtis was selected as his replacement, becoming at the age of 19 the youngest player at the time to feature in an FA Cup final.

Durban voiced his displeasure with Dwyer over the incident, although the two left the ground on amicable terms. Dwyer was surprised to arrive at Ninian Park two days later to be told that Durban had accepted an offer from Fourth Division side Rochdale to sign Dwyer on loan for the remainder of the season. Cardiff went on to finish the season in 21st position in Dwyer's absence, returning to the Third Division.

Cardiff's forwards were deemed to be the weaker of the two sides. Largely due to his physical prowess, Joe Nicholson, a half back who had converted to playing as a forward during the campaign, was expected to start ahead of top scorer Len Davies who had recovered from injury. Nicholson had been in doubt ahead of the tie after injuring himself in the aftermath of Cardiff's semi-final victory over Blackburn. While attempting to escape from a throng of excited fans outside the ground, he had climbed onto the canvas roof of a taxi only to fall through and suffer a cut to his knee.
