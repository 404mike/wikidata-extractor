From then on he had an eventful, busy and very musical life, one which saw him as a founder member of the Philharmonia Orchestra, a regular player at the Royal Opera House, a much-valued member of Benjamin Britten's English Opera Group orchestra, a conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, longtime professor at Trinity College of Music, London and occasional writer.\nIn 1959 he was asked to help Oliver Postgate by writing a bassoon theme for Ivor the Engine. He went on to compose the highly evocative music to the Smallfilms productions of Noggin the Nog, The Seal of Neptune,  Pogles' Wood, Pingwings and Clangers. A compilation album of his work for Clangers was released in 2001 and an album of his music for Ivor the Engine and Pogles' Wood followed in 2007.Elliott was a keen sailor, skier and bee-keeper.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 27", "response": ["*1912 \u2013 Vernon Elliott, English bassoon player, composer, and conductor (d. 1996)"]}, {"page": "Clangers", "response": ["The series was made by Smallfilms, the company set up by Oliver Postgate (who was the show's writer, animator and narrator) and Peter Firmin (who was its modelmaker and illustrator).

The music, often part of the story, was provided by Vernon Elliott.", "One of the most noted aspects was the use of sound effects, with a score composed by Vernon Elliott under instructions from Postgate. Although the episodes were scripted, most of the music used in the two series was written in translation by Postgate in the form of \"musical sketches\" or graphs that he drew for Elliott, who converted the drawings into a musical score.  The music was then recorded by the two, along with other musicians \u2013 dubbed the Clangers Ensemble \u2013 in a village hall, where they would often leave the windows open, leading to the sounds of birds outside being heard on some recordings.

In 1962, he won an Arts Council scholarship and left the London Philharmonic to study with the great Italian bassoonist Enzo Muccetti at the Arrigo Boito Conservatory in Parma.  Upon returning to England, he served as principal bassoonist of the newly formed Northern Sinfonia, where he stayed for almost 15 years.  In 1978, he became principal bassoonist of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and he held this post for the next 21 years.  He taught privately, and at University of York, and Trinity College of Music in London.  He made the first recording of Elgar's Romance for bassoon and orchestra Op. 62 with the Northern Sinfonia conducted by Neville Marriner.  Joubert's Bassoon Concerto was commissioned for Chapman.
