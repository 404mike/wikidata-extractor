As part of the late 19th century Gaelic revival, the instruments used differed greatly from the old wire-strung harps. The new instruments had gut strings, and their construction and playing style was based on the larger orchestral pedal harp. Nonetheless the name \"cl\u00e0rsach\" was and is still used in Scotland today to describe these new instruments. The modern gut-strung cl\u00e0rsach has thousands of players, both in Scotland and Ireland, as well as North America and elsewhere. The 1931 formation of the Clarsach Society kickstarted the modern harp renaissance. Recent harp players include Savourna Stevenson, Maggie MacInnes, and the band Sileas. Notable events include the Edinburgh International Harp Festival, which recently staged the world record for the largest number of harpists to play at the same time."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Maggie MacInnes, folk singer and cl\u00e0rsach player"]}, {"page": "Scots Trad Music Awards", "response": ["* Gaelic Singer of the Year: Maggie MacInnes"]}, {"page": "MacInnes", "response": ["*Maggie MacInnes (born 1963), Scottish folk singer "]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Gaelic-speaking people", "response": ["* Maggie MacInnes"]}, {"page": "Flora MacNeil", "response": ["Flora's daughter, Maggie MacInnes, is also a Gaelic singer and harpist."]}, {"page": "Kathleen MacInnes", "response": ["* Maggie MacInnes \u2013 \u00d2ran na Mn\u00e0 (A Woman's Song) (2006)"]}, {"page": "Colum Sands", "response": ["As well as performing his own songs, Sands has translated Goethe into English (recording a bilingual version of \"N\u00e4he des Geliebten\" with Berlin singer Scarlett Seeboldt), worked and toured in the Middle East with Israeli story teller Sharon Aviv on the English/Hebrew peace initiative production \"Talking to the Wall\" and translated Scottish Gaelic songs into English on his collaboration with Scottish singer and harper Maggie MacInnes.", "*2011: The Seedboat (B\u00e0ta an t-S\u00ecl) \u2013 with Maggie MacInnes, Spring Records SCD 1061"]}, {"page": "Iona Records", "response": ["* Maggie MacInnes", "| IR006 || George Jackson & Maggie MacInnes || Cairistiona || Calum Malcolm || Castle Sound Studios, Pencaitland, East Lothian || Colin Browne, Design; George Neill, illustration || vinyl || 1984 ||"]}]}}
