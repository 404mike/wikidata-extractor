Both men were declared guilty of being relapsed heretics, and they were sentenced to burn alive at the stake in Paris on 18 March 1314. De Molay reportedly remained defiant to the end, asking to be tied in such a way that he could face the Notre Dame Cathedral and hold his hands together in prayer. According to legend, he called out from the flames that both Pope Clement and King Philip would soon meet him before God. His actual words were recorded on the parchment as follows: \"Dieu sait qui a tort et a p\u00e9ch\u00e9.

The Papacy itself was one of permanent struggle and conflict, although scholars disagree as to the degree of culpability the papacy had for this. Duggan suggests that \"no fair judgment should be reached without recognising the vulnerability\" of the papacy itself. His policy, if he can be said to have one, she says, was shaped by events rather than shaping them. Ullmann argues that there was \"a perfect concordance between Adrian's symbolic actions and his acts of government\".

Historian Malcolm Barber argues that her death \"may have been the decisive event that persuaded\" Baldwin \"to seek out a lordship in the East\". According to the historians Steven Runciman and Christopher MacEvitt, Baldwin and Godehilde had children who did not long survive her, but historian Alan V. Murray emphasises that no primary source states that Baldwin fathered children. According to Murray, Runciman was wrong when he translated William of Tyre's words about Baldwin's \"familia\" as a reference to his family, because William of Tyre was referring to Baldwin's household.", "Summarising Baldwin's marriages, historian Jonathan Phillips concludes that Baldwin \"regarded women as useful sources of financial and political advancement but little else\". Decades after Baldwin's death, William of Tyre wrote that Baldwin was \"said to have struggled with weakness of the flesh\", but only a few of his \"body-servants\" were aware of this. Historians Hans Eberhard Mayer, Christopher Tyerman and Malcolm Barber agree that William of Tyre most probably referred to Baldwin's homosexuality. Tyerman adds that a converted Muslim was one of Baldwin's lovers, but he betrayed Baldwin during the siege of Sidon. He proposed that the defenders of the town kill the king, but Baldwin was warned in advance. On the other hand, Susan B. Edgington states that there is \"little evidence to support\" the theories about Baldwin's homosexuality, emphasizing that his contemporaries made no reference to it."]}, {"page": "Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon", "response": ["Raynald accompanied Baldwin to Antioch in 1151 and settled in the principality, according to Steven Runciman.

They kept their betrothal a secret until Baldwin gave his permission to their marriage."]}, {"page": "Jacques de Molay", "response": ["It has been claimed that Jacques de Molay cursed King Philip IV of France and his descendants from his execution pyre. However, the story of the shouted curse appears to be a combination of words by a different Templar, and those of Molay. An eyewitness to the execution stated that Molay had shown no sign of fear and had told those present that God would avenge their deaths.Barber, The Trial of the Templars, 2nd ed. p. 357 \"The account given by the continuator of William Nangis is confirmed by the clerk, Geoffrey of Paris, apparently an eyewitness, who describes Molay as showing no sign of fear and, significantly, as telling those present that God would avenge their deaths.\" Another variation on this story was told by the contemporary chronicler Ferretto of Vicenza, who applied the idea to a Neapolitan Templar brought before Clement V, whom he denounced for his injustice. Some time later, as he was about to be executed, he appealed \"from this your heinous judgement to the living and true God, who is in Heaven\", warning the Pope that, within a year and a day, he and Philip IV would be obliged to answer for their crimes in God's presence.Ferretto of Vicenza, 'Historia rerum in Italia gestarum ab anno 1250 as annum usque 1318', c. 1328, in Malcolm Barber's, The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 314\u2013315.", "Some 400 years after the death of de Molay and the dissolution of the Knights Templar, the fraternal order of Freemasonry began to emerge in northern Europe.

The stories of the Templars' secret initiation ceremonies also proved a tempting source for Masonic writers who were creating new works of pseudohistory. As described by modern historian Malcolm Barber in The New Knighthood: \"It was during the 1760s that German masons introduced a specific Templar connection, claiming that the Order, through its occupation of the Temple of Solomon, had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers, which Jacques DeMolay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenth-century Freemasons were the direct heirs.\"Barber, The New Knighthood, pp. 317\u2013318."]}, {"page": "Baphomet", "response": ["When the medieval order of the Knights Templar was suppressed by King Philip\u00a0IV of France, on Friday 13\u00a0October 1307, Philip had many French Templars simultaneously arrested, and then tortured into confessions. Over 100 different charges had been leveled against the Templars, including heresy, homosexual relations, spitting and urinating on the cross, and sodomy. Most of them were dubious, as they were the same charges that were leveled against the Cathars. and many of King Philip's enemies; he had earlier kidnapped Pope Boniface\u00a0VIII and charged him with nearly identical offenses. Yet Malcolm Barber observes that historians \"find it difficult to accept that an affair of such enormity rests upon total fabrication\".. The \"Chinon Parchment suggests that the Templars did indeed spit on the cross\", says Sean Martin, and that these acts were intended to simulate the kind of humiliation and torture that a Crusader might be subjected to if captured by the Saracens, where they were taught how to commit apostasy \"with the mind only and not with the heart\".. Similarly, Michael Haag suggests that the simulated worship of Baphomet did indeed form part of a Templar initiation rite."]}, {"page": "Baldwin II of Jerusalem", "response": ["A confraternity of knights established by Hugh of Payns and Godfrey de Saint-Omer to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land most probably received official recognition at the council, according to historians Malcolm Barber and Christopher Tyerman.

He offered Nabi Samwil to the Cistercians, but Bernard of Clairvaux ceded the place to the Premonstratensians who built a monastery. Shortly after the council, Baldwin and Patriarch Warmund also sent letters to Pope Calixtus II and the Venetians, urging them to support the defense of the Holy Land.

They were immediately found guilty of being relapsed heretics, for which the punishment was death. This effectively silenced the other Templars.
