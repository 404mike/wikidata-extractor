Tolkien made another major effort in 1946, and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947. The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949.

H. Auden, Tolkien recollects that he began work on The Hobbit one day early in the 1930s, when he was marking School Certificate papers. He found a blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\" By late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, including C. S. Lewis and a student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths. In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher George Allen & Unwin, she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien. In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book to Stanley Unwin, who then asked his 10-year-old son Rayner to review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.", "In December 1937 The Hobbit publisher, Stanley Unwin, asked Tolkien for a sequel. In response Tolkien provided drafts for The Silmarillion, but the editors rejected them, believing that the public wanted \"more about hobbits\".

However, Tolkien was at the time starting to consider the true nature of the Ring, and the idea that it had been made by the Necromancer, and drew itself or its bearer back to him.The Return of the Shadow, pp. 42\u201343 The Black Riders became Ringwraiths when the hobbit, at that time called Bingo rather than Frodo, discussed the Riders with the Elf Gildor, later in the same chapter. Over the next three years, Tolkien gradually developed the connections between the Nazg\u00fbl, the One Ring, Sauron, and all the other Rings of Power. The pieces finally all came together when Tolkien wrote \"The Mirror of Galadriel\", some hundreds of pages later, around the autumn of 1941.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 7 \"The Mirror of Galadriel\"The Treason of Isengard, pp. 259\u2013260"]}, {"page": "Tom Bombadil", "response": ["Tolkien commented further that \"even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are.

Despite his fondness for it, the form \"dwarrow\" only appears in his writing as \"Dwarrowdelf\" (\"Dwarf-digging\"), a name for Moria. He used \"Dwarves\", instead, corresponding to his \"Elves\" as a plural for \"Elf\".
