Carol's father Jim Branning, played by John Bardon, had appeared in the show in 1996 as a guest character and was reintroduced in 1999 as a regular by Matthew Robinson. Three other of Jim's children, April Branning (Debbie Arnold), Derek Branning (Terence Beesley) and Sue Branning (Julie Christian-Young) also appeared in 1995 and 1996, as well as his first wife Reenie Branning (Joy Graham), who died off screen in 1999, allowing Jim to move in with his grandchildren. Jim was paired romantically with Dot Cotton (June Brown), and the couple married on screen in February 2002. The family was extended in 2005 with the arrival of Jim's grandson Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements), in January 2006. Bradley's arrival prompted a series of complaints from residents in the Hertfordshire town of Tring, where Bradley had allegedly lived before he moved to East London, as they thought their town had been portrayed as \"snobbish\". The BBC responded by saying that Tring was chosen following a storyline conference in the town, where the production team enjoyed their stay, saying that Bradley was not a snob but was portrayed as a character who led a sheltered life because his father left him when he was young. In 2006, scriptwriters decided to pair Bradley with the character Stacey Slater, played by Lacey Turner. Meanwhile, actor Jake Wood was introduced as Bradley's estranged father Max Branning, along with his second wife Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) and their two daughters Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan from 2006 to 2010, Jacqueline Jossa since 2010) and Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald).
