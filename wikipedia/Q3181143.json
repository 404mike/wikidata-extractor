He went on to Winchester School of Art and Leicester College of Art, and thereafter worked as a lorry driver and labourer while getting his career as sculptor off the ground.In 1976, his friend Bill Heine invited Buckley to design the sculptural fixtures on the Penultimate Picture Palace. For the facade Buckley chose a dramatic figure reminiscent of Al Jolson with outstretched hands. Mae West's lips were the inspiration for the cinema's door handles and, somewhat later Buckley would erect a male and a female figure above the toilet entrances, whimsically named Pearl and Dean.\nIn 1978, a work of his (Pagliaccio) was exhibited by Nicholas Treadwell at the Washington Art Fair, and he stayed with Treadwell for some time thereafter.The \"Headington Shark\" was erected on the 41st anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Made of fibreglass on the farm near Wallingford, Oxfordshire where he was based, the shark itself weighs 203 kilograms and is 25 feet long. Buckley regards it as an integral part of \"Untitled 1986\" or \"Shark House\", a work of \"Mixed Media, Brick, slates, wood, metal, polyester resin, glass, plaster, oil paint, lace curtaining and window boxes\u2026\u2026.\"In the village of Checkendon in South Oxfordshire is his public work 'The Nuba Survival' which features two giant skeletons embracing each other. The piece was created in 2001 after he visited the Nuba peoples in Sudan.\n\nJohn Buckley is a patron of MAG (Mines Advisory Group), a neutral and impartial humanitarian organisation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wallingford, Oxfordshire", "response": ["*John Buckley, sculptor"]}, {"page": "De Montfort University", "response": ["* John Buckley, sculptor"]}, {"page": "Bill Heine", "response": ["American-born, Heine lived in Oxford since studying for a postgraduate degree at Balliol College in the late 1960s.

The structure is in deliberate contrast with its otherwise ordinary suburban setting.", "Created by sculptor John Buckley, the shark was controversial when it first appeared. Oxford City Council tried to have it taken down on grounds of safety, and then on the grounds that it had not given planning permission for the shark, offering to host it at the local swimming pool instead, but there was much local support for the shark. Eventually the matter was taken to the central government, where Tony Baldry, a minister in the Department of the Environment, who assessed the case on planning grounds, ruled in 1992 that the shark would be allowed to remain as it did not result in harm to the visual amenity.", "* John Buckley sculptor website"]}, {"page": "1986 in art", "response": ["*John Buckley \u2013 The Headington Shark (Untitled 1986; painted fibreglass sculpture)"]}, {"page": "Winchester School of Art", "response": ["*John Buckley, sculptor"]}, {"page": "Headington", "response": ["Headington's most famous modern landmark is The Headington Shark, made by John Buckley for local broadcaster Bill Heine in 1986.
