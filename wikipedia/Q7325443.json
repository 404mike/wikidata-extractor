He spent numerous seasons in the Premier League and remained with the club through several relegations, followed by several promotions. He also appeared for Birmingham City in a loan spell and after leaving City in 2002 he moved on to Wigan Athletic. Spells with Sheffield United, Queens Park Rangers and Bradford City followed before ending his career with Macclesfield Town. He was capped by both England U21 and England B.\nFollowing retirement he returned to City as a youth team coach and later became a tour guide at the Etihad Stadium.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Dunne", "response": ["In the autumn of 2000, Dunne was signed by Manchester City for a fee of \u00a33.5 million, rejoining his former manager Joe Royle.

City were sixth on 3 December and there was talk of a much-awaited return to European football, as young talents such as Garry Flitcroft, Richard Edghill, and Steve Lomas came to the fore. However they won only four of their remaining 25 league games, finishing just four points clear of relegation, and Horton was sacked. His sacking was predicted by many, as Francis Lee had taken over as chairman after Horton's appointment, and wished to have his 'own man' in the dugout at Maine Road. City went on to suffer relegation the following season under Alan Ball and Horton said that \"once I had left, Francis made transfers which I could not fathom\"."]}, {"page": "Paul Lake", "response": ["Following his retirement from playing football, Lake used his experience on the treatment table to train to become a physiotherapist. He began working on the Manchester City medical team in 1997, and helped Richard Edghill to recover from the same injury that had claimed his own career. The following year he was appointed first team physio at Burnley. He went on to work as the physio at non-league club Altrincham, where he balanced the club's medical expenses on a tight budget. Like his previous positions, he remained at Altrincham for just one season, before moving on to Oldham Athletic. In 2003, he switched clubs to Macclesfield Town. He graduated with a degree in physiotherapy at Salford University in May 2003. In November 2007 he joined the medical staff at Bolton Wanderers. He left Bolton in 2008 and ran his own physiotherapy practice in Greater Manchester until March 2010, when he was appointed Ambassador for Manchester City in the Community. In June 2013, he stepped down as City's ambassador to take up a similar role with the Premier League."]}, {"page": "Martyn Margetson", "response": ["Margetson began his career with Manchester City, signing as a YTS trainee at the age of 18 where he featured largely as understudy during a downturn in the club's fortunes. His full debut came in May 1990, deputising for the suspended Tony Coton in a Manchester derby at Old Trafford, and he retained his place for the following match against Sunderland. In the next two seasons he made four appearances, but did not make a single first team appearance in the two seasons after. His next first team appearance was an unusual one. In a League Cup match against Wycombe, Manchester City had used both outfield substitutes when Richard Edghill sustained an injury and could not continue. Margetson, the only remaining substitute, was introduced as a striker for the final few minutes of the match. p. 35"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Richard Edghill||  || Defender || 1993\u20132001||210||1|| ||"]}, {"page": "Nick Fenton", "response": ["Preston born Fenton came through the youth ranks of Premiership side Manchester City.

He was promoted to the Manchester City first team squad a few months after the club's relegation in the summer of 1996. By the time Fenton was given his first team debut City had suffered a further relegation into the third tier of English football. On 19 August 1998 Fenton earned his first appearance for City when he started the match in a 7\u20131 English League Cup victory over Notts County at Maine Road.

He, however, was unable to be the right back many City fans had hoped for and lost his place in the team. The following season, Kevin Keegan replaced Joe Royle as manager and Charvet was given his chance again. But in the 3-5-2 formation that Keegan adopted, Shaun Wright-Phillips was preferred to the Frenchman in the right wing-back position as was Edghill. Charvet played for City 23 times, scoring once.
