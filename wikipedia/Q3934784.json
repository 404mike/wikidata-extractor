After the settlement of Iceland, a hofgo\u00f0i was usually a wealthy and respected man in his district, for he had to maintain the communal hall or hof in which community religious observances and feasts were held. The office over which a go\u00f0i had leadership was termed a go\u00f0or\u00f0, a word that only appears in Icelandic sources. Initially many independent go\u00f0or\u00f0 were established, until they united under the Althing around 930. In 964 the system was fixed under a constitution that recognized 39 go\u00f0or\u00f0. The role of the go\u00f0ar as secular leaders is shown in how the word was used synonymously with h\u00f6f\u00f0ingi, meaning chieftain. Over time, and especially after 1000, when the Christian conversion occurred in Iceland, the term lost all religious connotations and came to mean liege-lord or chieftain of the Icelandic Commonwealth.An Icelandic-English dictionary by Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigfusson (1874) p. 208. A go\u00f0or\u00f0 could be bought, shared, traded or inherited. If a woman inherited a go\u00f0or\u00f0 she had to leave the leadership to a man. The office was in many respects treated as private property but was not counted as taxable, and is defined in the Gray Goose Laws as \"power and not wealth\" (veldi er \u00feat en \u00e6igi fe); nevertheless the go\u00f0ar are frequently portrayed in the sagas as concerned with money and expected to be paid for their services."]}, {"page": "Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson", "response": ["* An Icelandic-English Dictionary by Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigfusson, published in 1874."]}, {"page": "D\u00e1inn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Dura\u00fer\u00f3r", "response": ["The word barr has been the cause of some confusion since it is most often applied to the needles of fir or pine trees.
