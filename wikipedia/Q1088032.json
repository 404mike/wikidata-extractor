The King promised Llywelyn that if the charges were found true, he would be hanged. Llywelyn fled and prepared for war. On 28 January 1316, Llywelyn began the revolt by a surprise attack on Caerphilly Castle. He captured the constable outside the castle and the outer ward but could not break into the inner defences. They burned the town, slaughtered some of its inhabitants and started a siege. The town was rebuilt but remained very small throughout the Middle Ages.

Mathias Goll stresses that while plate armour was more effective, the segmented armour could be \"lighter and more flexible while it left less 'dangerous' chinks\". The segmented armour also put fewer demands on the craftsman, requiring fewer tools and less skill, thus being prominently cheaper. As a consequence, the \"older\" types could remain in production alongside more \"modern\" developments. In addition to protection and wearer comfort, this armor was also chosen for fashion.Goll 2013: pp. 53. In 1295, the coat of plates was worn along with mail by nearly all troops in an army gathered by King Philip IV of France. In that same year, a Lombard merchant brought to Bruges the huge amount of 5,067 coats-of-plates, alongside other equipment.Nicolle, David, 1999, In 1295 a Lombard merchant brought no fewer than 1,885 crossbows, 666,258 quarreli, 6,309 small shields, 2,853 light helmets, 4,511 quilted coats, 751 pairs of gauntlets, 1,374 gorgiera neck protectors and brassards, 5,067 coats-of-plates, 13,495 lances or lanceheads, 1,989 axes and 14,599 swords and couteaux daggers to Brugge, p. 53. The armor was so popular that in 1316 the captured harnesses of the Welsh noble Llywelyn Bren included a \"buckram armor\".Heath, Ian 1989, the confiscated armor of the rebel Llywelyn Bren (of the royal house of Senghenydd in Glamorgan) is recorded to have comprised an aketon, a gambeson, 3 haubergeons, an iron breastplate, a buckram armor (doubtless a coat-of-plates), an iron helmet, 2 pairs of maunc' (vambraces), a shield and a pair of gauntlets. Though this harness is somewhat more comprehensive than that generically in use at the end of the 13th century, the significant point is that would have made Llywelyn Bren undistinguishable from his English adversaries., p. 93. By the second half of the 14th century, the coat of plates became affordable enough to be worn by soldiers of lesser status, like the Gotland's militiamen or the urban militia of Paris.
