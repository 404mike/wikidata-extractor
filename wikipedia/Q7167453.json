In addition to representing Eton at fives, he was a capable cricketer at school, club and county level, and was unique among British prime ministers in having played first-class cricket. Coached by George Hirst, he became in Wisden's phrase \"a useful member of the Eton\u00a0XI\" that included Percy Lawrie and Gubby Allen. Wisden observed, \"In the rain-affected Eton\u2013Harrow match of 1922 he scored 66, despite being hindered by a saturated outfield, and then took 4 for 37 with his medium-paced out-swingers\"."]}]}}
