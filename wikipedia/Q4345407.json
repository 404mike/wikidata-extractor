They failed to win any of their first ten games and were knocked out of the League Cup by Division Two side Stockport. Harford handed in his resignation on 25 October and was replaced temporarily by coach Tony Parkes, who took charge until the end of the season and guided Rovers to 13th in the final table before Roy Hodgson was appointed as permanent manager."]}, {"page": "Blackburn Rovers F.C.", "response": ["Kenny Dalglish moved upstairs to the position of Director of Football at the end of the Premier League winning season, and handed over the reins to his assistant Ray Harford. Blackburn Rovers made a poor start to the 1995\u201396 season, and found themselves in the bottom half for most of the first half of the season. Rovers also struggled in the Champions League and finished bottom of their group with just four points. A terrible start to the 1996\u201397 Premier League campaign saw Harford resign in late October with the club bottom of the division, having failed to win any of their first ten games. Relegation looked a real possibility, just two seasons after winning the league. After an abortive attempt to bring in Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson as manager, long-serving coach Tony Parkes took over as manager for the rest of the campaign, narrowly steering the side to survival. That summer, the manager's job was taken by Roy Hodgson, who joined the club from Internazionale. UEFA Cup football was secured with a 6th-place finish. However, Rovers made a poor start to the 1998\u201399 campaign and Hodgson was sacked in December less than an hour after a 2\u20130 home defeat by bottom side Southampton, a result that locked Rovers in the relegation zone. He was replaced as manager by Brian Kidd. However Kidd failed to save Rovers from relegation."]}, {"page": "Caretaker manager", "response": ["On the other hand, Tony Parkes was appointed as caretaker manager of Blackburn Rovers on six separate occasions between 1986 and 2004, without ever being given the role in a permanent capacity.

Late in the game with The Gunners leading by a single goal, the ball was kicked out of play by Arsenal to allow an injured teammate to receive treatment. Under the unwritten sportsmanship rule, Arsenal would expect the ball to be returned to them unhindered. However, Sutton chased the ball instead of allowing it to be thrown back to Arsenal and won a corner from his efforts, from which Blackburn scored. At the end of the season, Arsenal missed out on a lucrative place in the Champions League to Newcastle United on goal difference. Following the incident Blackburn's interim manager Tony Parkes described Sutton as \"a boy who was sometimes a bit dizzy ... a bit silly\", stating \"It was against the spirit of the game and he should not have done it\". Sutton refused to apologise for his actions."]}, {"page": "Parkes", "response": ["* Tony Parkes (born 1949), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Tony Parkes", "|  Tony Parkes (caretaker)"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 FA Premier League", "response": ["|  Tony Parkes"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 FA Premier League", "response": ["|  Tony Parkes (caretaker)", "|  Tony Parkes"]}, {"page": "Craig Short", "response": ["In his final league game for Rovers on 7 May 2005 against Fulham, Short was handed the captain's armband by then manager Mark Hughes.

Holloway described the achievement as the best moment of his life, aside from seeing his children born. Holloway followed this up in late July by leading Blackpool to victory in the South West Challenge Cup annual pre-season tournament. It was the first time a Premier League club had taken part."]}]}}
