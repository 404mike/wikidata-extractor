He was a captain, playing as a centre, or stand-off, as well as a Barrow club legend. Jackson won 27 Great Britain caps, played in the 1954 and 1957 Rugby League World Cups and twice toured Australasia with the Lions.Jackson was born in Canada but moved to Barrow-in-Furness, England, with his parents at the age of three. He played rugby league at school but his first senior rugby experience came in rugby union after he took up an apprenticeship at a shipyard. He switched to rugby league when he was offered professional terms by Barrow in 1950 at the age of 18.\nWith Barrow, where he was known as the 'Prince Among Centres', he played in three Challenge Cup finals in the 1950s. Injury forced him to retire in 1959 but in 1960 he moved to Australia and was tempted back into playing by the Goulburn Workers Club in New South Wales. In the role as player coach, he led the club to a Group 8 premiership. The club was also awarded the Clayton Cup for being the best performed team in country New South Wales in 1960. He continued coaching after retiring as a player and eventually settled in Wagga Wagga.\nHe was inducted into the Barrow Hall of Fame when it was launched in 2001 alongside 1950s teammates Willie Horne and Jimmy Lewthwaite.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1954 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["|RC ||3|| Phil Jackson", "*  Phil Jackson"]}, {"page": "1957 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["In the end Australia were dominant, winning all matches and were declared the champions by virtue of finishing top of the group \u2013 there was no World Cup Final.Paddy McAteer (22 December 2010) \"Whole World in their Hands\"  North West Evening Mail Best and fairest awards were made to individual nations, the recipients being Gilbert Benausse (France), Brian Carlson (Australia), Phil Jackson (Great Britain) and Bill Sorensen (New Zealand).", "*  Phil Jackson"]}, {"page": "Barrow Raiders", "response": ["The Barrow club launched its Hall of Fame in 2001 with 1950s legends Willie Horne, Phil Jackson and Jimmy Lewthwaite its inaugural inductees."]}, {"page": "Philip Jackson", "response": ["*Phil Jackson (rugby league, born 1932), British rugby league back during 1950s", "*Phil Jackson (born 1945), American basketball player and coach in NBA", "*Phil Jackson (rugby league 1970s), British rugby league forward during 1970s", "*Phil Jackson (boxer) (born 1964), American heavyweight boxer", "*Phil Jackson Ibarg\u00fcen (born 1985), Colombian footballer"]}, {"page": "Willie Horne", "response": ["Horne was inducted into the Barrow club's Hall of Fame when it was launched in 2001 alongside 1950s teammates Phil Jackson and Jimmy Lewthwaite."]}, {"page": "Clayton Cup", "response": ["| Phil Jackson"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Lewthwaite", "response": ["He was inducted into the club's Hall of Fame when it was launched in 2001, alongside 1950s teammates Phil Jackson and Willie Horne."]}, {"page": "Jackson (name)", "response": ["*Phil Jackson (born 1945), American basketball coach", "*Phil Jackson (boxer) (born 1964), American boxer", "*Phil Jackson (rugby league, born 1932), British rugby player"]}, {"page": "Derek Turner", "response": ["According to Lion Phil Jackson \"Vince Karalius was much lauded here as one of the best loose forwards to go (to Australia) and I reckon Derek Turner were [sic] a better player\"."]}]}}
