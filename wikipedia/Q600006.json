He also received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Ariel in the 1980 BBC version of The Tempest (directed by John Gorrie). He would later rejoin the Hitchhiker's Guide by lending his voice to the \"Ecological Man\" and the \"Zirzla Leader\" in Fit the Twentieth of the radio series, while Geoffrey McGivern, who had originally played the character on radio, returned to the role of Ford.Despite a relatively sparse TV and film career, David Dixon has over the years acquired a loyal fan following online who call themselves \"Dixonites\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "response": ["The core cast for the third to fifth radio series remained the same, except for the replacement of Peter Jones by William Franklyn as the Book, and Richard Vernon by Richard Griffiths as Slartibartfast, since both had died.
