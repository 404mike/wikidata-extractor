During a September 2011 BBC Scotland TV interview, Labour leader Ed Miliband was unable to recall Macintosh's name. After the interview, Miliband telephoned to apologise for his mistake and Macintosh tried to downplay the incident saying \"I don't think anyone should read anything into it \u2013 half the time I can't even remember the names of my own kids.\" Macintosh officially launched his campaign at Cumbernauld College on 28 October. He described the 2011 election result as a \"disaster\" and said the party had been too negative: \"We need to unite as a party and to start talking positively about our values, what Labour stands for and not just what we are against.\" He later also said he was a devolutionist, not a unionist. Despite lacking ministerial experience, he was widely seen as a frontrunner. Colleagues who endorsed his bid included his campaign manager Michael McMahon, Claire Baker, Mary Fee, Neil Bibby, Mark Griffin, Kezia Dugdale, Jenny Marra and East Renfrewshire MP Jim Murphy, with whom Macintosh shared his constituency office in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire. In the ensuing leadership election, Macintosh came second to MSP Johann Lamont."]}, {"page": "Scottish Labour", "response": ["*Mark Griffin - Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Housing and \u00a0Local Government", "|Mark Griffin || Central Scotland|| 2011||"]}, {"page": "Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\"|Mark Griffin(Labour)"]}, {"page": "2007 North Lanarkshire Council election", "response": ["*Labour's Francis Griffin died on 10 November 2007.
