Originally a stage actor, \"truly dreadful\" according to Riddington himself, he moved to a back stage role managing the Adelphi Theatre from 1950 and then directing the musical Rendezvous at the Comedy Theatre in 1952. Later, he managed the London Palladium and Palace Theatres in London's West End. After a period as a BBC television floor manager in the early 1970s, he became a producer. His first project as a producer to gain recognition was the 10 part serial adaptation of Anna Karenina (1977).Subsequently Riddington produced several high-profile television series and serials, including A Horseman Riding By (1978), Tenko (1981), To Serve Them All My Days (1981), The Citadel (1983), Diana (1984), The House of Eliott (1991) and Andrew Davies's adaptations of Michael Dobbs' House of Cards trilogy \u2014 House of Cards (1990), To Play the King (1993) and The Final Cut (1995). Riddington was involved with several other projects scripted by Davies, including A Very Peculiar Practice (1986\u201388), a black comedy set in a university medical centre.\nFor a time during the 1980s, he was the acting Head of Series & Serials in the BBC drama department, before returning to front-line producing work. Ending his period at the BBC at the age of 75, he and his wife Liz Riddington enjoyed twelve years of retirement before Ken moved to a London nursing home, where he was treated for dementia.Riddington died on 26 December 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sydney Newman", "response": ["In 1986, the then Controller of BBC One, Michael Grade, unhappy with the current state of Doctor Who, wrote to Newman to enquire whether he had any ideas for reformatting the series, which was at the time struggling in the ratings and with its star Colin Baker about to be fired by Grade. On 6 October 1986, Newman wrote back to Grade with a suggestion that he take direct control of the series as executive producer, that Patrick Troughton should return to the role of the Doctor for a season, and then regenerate into a female, with Newman suggesting either Joanna Lumley, Dawn French or Frances de la Tour to succeed Troughton. Grade then suggested that Newman meet the current Head of Drama, Jonathan Powell, for lunch to discuss the Canadian's ideas. Newman and Powell did not get on well, however, and nothing came of their meeting. Newman was also unsuccessful in an attempt to have his name added to the end credits of the show as its creator. Acting Head of Series & Serials Ken Riddington, to whom Newman's request had been referred, wrote to him that \"Heads of Department who originate programmes have to be satisfied with the other rewards that flow from doing so.\""]}, {"page": "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series", "response": ["| Ken Riddington, executive producer; Joan Sullivan, series producer; Donald Wilson, producer", "| Ken Riddington, producer"]}, {"page": "The Citadel (1983 TV series)", "response": ["The Citadel is a 1983 BBC television adaptation written by Don Shaw from A.
