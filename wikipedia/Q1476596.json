Christie sent several of copies of his books to Soane, and Soane invited Christie to the opening of the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I by lamplight, which Christie missed, lamenting that it \"would be so particularly interesting to me as it would coincide so nearly with my speculations upon the lamplight exhibitions at Eleusis\".
