The county club has its origin in the Kent Club founded at Canterbury on 6 August 1842. A similar organisation was formed at Maidstone in 1859 and, in 1870, these two amalgamated to create the present county club. Like the Kent county teams formed by earlier organisations, including the old Town Malling club, the county club has always been classified as a top-class team. The players listed have played for the club in first-class cricket, List A cricket or Twenty20 cricket matches.\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a Kent player and then his name is given as it would usually appear on modern match scorecards. Note that many players represented other teams besides Kent. Current players are shown as active to the latest year in which they played for the club. The list excludes Second XI and other players who did not play for the club's first team. Players who represented the county before August 1842 are included only if they also played for the county club after its initial formation.\n\nAs of 17 July 2021\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Webb (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Webb (born 1972) is an English comedian, actor and writer.", "Robert Webb may also refer to:", "* Robert Webb (MP) (c. 1719\u20131765), English politician and merchant", "* Robert Webb (cricketer, born 1806) (1806\u20131880), English cricketer", "* Robert Webb (Kent cricketer) (1840\u2013?), English cricketer", "* Robert Webb, creator of polyhedra software Stella"]}]}}
