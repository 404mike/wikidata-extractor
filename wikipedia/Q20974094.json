During her early years on Broadway, she studied acting under Clare Tree Major."]}, {"page": "Theatre for Young Audiences", "response": ["Education was the main purpose of TYA when it first arrived to the US. In 1903, Alice Minnie Herts founded The Children\u2019s Educational Theatre, which was the first US company to produce theatrical work both with and for children. Although it did not last long, The Children\u2019s Educational Theatre inspired both the birth of other companies around the country, as well as continuous growth in the writing and production of plays for younger audiences. The Drama League of America was another big influence in TYA within the US: children\u2019s leagues were established in cities across the country, and material for younger audiences was both presented at these establishments and distributed to any interested groups. The Drama League was responsible for changing theatre for children from its originally purely educational intent into the broader Theatre for Young Audiences known today. Once the TYA movement started to gain traction, many different companies and playwrights chose to partake in this new branch of theatre. Some include early TYA playwright Constance Mackay, the Chicago company The Junior League, New York producer Clare Tree Major, The Children\u2019s Theatre of Evanston, and many others. Today, TYA continues to thrive, with an increasing number of playwrights, performers, producers, and companies taking part in it."]}]}}
