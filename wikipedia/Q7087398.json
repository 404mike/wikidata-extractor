Edward R. Taylor's educational developments in Birmingham in the 1880s were a direct influence on William Lethaby's innovations at London's Central School of Arts and Crafts from 1896, which in turn provided the model for the establishment of the Bauhaus by Walter Gropius in 1919. The Dutch architect, furniture designer and De Stijl group founder Robert van 't Hoff studied at the Birmingham School of Art from 1906 to 1911 and worked for Birmingham architect Herbert Tudor Buckland, later also coming under the influence of the Birmingham-born cubist and futurist David Bomberg. Locally too, an Arts and Crafts background was the common feature of many of Birmingham's more progressive and influential designers. The silverware that launched the Cymric line for Liberty & Co. in 1901 \u2013 one of the most widely recognized archetypes of Art Nouveau worldwide, and work which resulted in Art Nouveau becoming known as the \"Stile Liberty\" in continental Europe \u2013 was manufactured by the Birmingham silversmiths W.
