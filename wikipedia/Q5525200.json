Both sides had chances in the first half, but the match remained goalless until the 67th minute, when Karl Goddard scored for the hosts. Middlesbrough equalised a minute later, through a header from Trevor Senior, but Bradford retook the lead almost immediately when Stuart McCall scored from close-range.

He said that one of them, Gary Hamilton, had a bottle thrown at him. Roughly 30 police officers created a cordon between the opposing fans, and prevented them from engaging until a mounted police unit arrived to disperse the crowd, and according to the Sunday Mirror, they charged into the supporters on the pitch, knocking some of them over. The police continued to clear the Chelsea fans from the pitch and the terraces for 40 minutes, doing so \"under a constant hail of missiles\" according to the Sunday Tribune. After 45 minutes, the Middlesbrough players were able to return to the pitch and celebrate with their fans, who remained in the North Stand."]}, {"page": "Gary Hamilton", "response": ["Gary Hamilton may refer to:", "* Gary Hamilton (footballer, born 1980), football player from Northern Ireland", "* Gary Hamilton (footballer, born 1965), Scottish football player for Middlesbrough and Darlington", "* Gary Hamilton (basketball) (born 1986), American basketball player", "* Gary Hamilton (kickboxer) (born 1980), Northern Ireland's kickboxer"]}, {"page": "Gary Hamilton (footballer born 1965)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gary Hamilton (footballer, born 1965)"]}]}}
