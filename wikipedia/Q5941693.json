Efforts to reduce this minimum were not successful, so Wing Commander Humphrey de Verd Leigh hit upon the idea of using a searchlight that would be switched on just when the target was about to disappear on radar. The U-boat had insufficient time to dive and the bombardier had a clear view of the target. Introduced in June 1942, it was so successful that for a time German submarines were forced to switch to charging their batteries during the daytime, when they could at least see aircraft approaching.", "Wing Commander Humphrey de Verd Leigh, an RAF personnel officer, came up with his own solution after chatting with returning aircrew. This was to mount a searchlight under the aircraft, pointed forward and allowing the submarine to be spotted as soon as the light was turned on. He then developed the Leigh Light entirely on his own, in secret and without official sanction\u2014even the Air Ministry were unaware of its development until shown the completed prototype.The Secret War, by Brian Johnson, Pen And Sword Military Classics, 1978,  pages 216\u2013217) At first it was difficult to fit on aircraft due to its size. Leigh persisted in his efforts to test the idea, and garnered the support of the Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, Sir Frederick Bowhill. In March 1941 a Vickers Wellington DWI that conveniently already had the necessary generator on board, (it had been used for anti-magnetic mining operations using a large electromagnet) was modified with a retractable \"dustbin\" holding the lamp, and proved the concept sound."]}, {"page": "List of people from Aldershot", "response": ["* Humphrey de Verd Leigh - RAF officer and inventor"]}, {"page": "Humphry de Verde Leigh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Humphrey de Verd Leigh"]}, {"page": "H. de V.

Although included in video versions of The Secret War as a seventh episode, this programme was not made as part of the series and was aired separate from The Secret War when it was first shown.
