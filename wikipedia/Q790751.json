His scoring form continued with strikes against Raith Rovers, Dundee and Queen Of the South. On 25 January, Halliday was sent off for the second time that season in controversial circumstances during a league match away to Morton: he was alleged to have made an offensive gesture to the home support after Barrie McKay had scored to make it 2\u20130 to Rangers which led him being shown a second yellow card, and the decision by referee Barry Cook angered both player and Rangers manager Mark Warburton. Halliday later noted the incident was a career low point. In the absence of regular penalty taker Martyn Waghorn, Halliday converted from the spot in the 4\u20130 win over Peterhead in the 2016 Scottish Challenge Cup Final; he also scored his penalty in the Scottish Cup semi-final shoot-out against Celtic. He scored a \"stunning\" long-range goal to put Rangers 2\u20131 ahead in the final against Hibernian, but they would go on to lose 3\u20132."]}, {"page": "Daniel McKay", "response": ["He is the brother of fellow footballer Barrie McKay."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|Barrie McKay"]}]}}
