At Norwich, Huckerby's career settled, and he netted 14 league goals in the First Division in the 2003\u201304 season.

Loss of form during the 2004\u201305 Premier League season did lead to Drury being dropped for a short time and he was relieved of the captaincy (which passed to Craig Fleming) until the start of the 2006\u201307 season when he was re-instated. Towards the end of the 2004\u201305 season he found his form again and turned in an outstanding display as part of the Norwich team that beat Manchester United 2\u20130 at Carrow Road. He continued to be a key member of the Norwich squad on their return to the Championship for season 2005\u201306. Norwich manager Nigel Worthington named Drury as Norwich City captain for the 2006\u201307 season, though Worthington's successor Peter Grant awarded the captaincy to Jason Shackell at the beginning of the 2007\u201308 campaign."]}, {"page": "J\u00fcrgen Colin", "response": ["Colin had a difficult first year at Norwich and struggled for form, eventually losing his place at right back to Craig Fleming. He was re-instated to the team at the start of the 2006\u201307 season and ultimately retained his status; however, when new club manager Peter Grant took over, he lost his place to versatile midfielder Andy Hughes."]}]}}
