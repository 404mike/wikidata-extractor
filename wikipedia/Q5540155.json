They were the parents of one son, James Halyburton.  Archibald died at the battle of Sauchieburn, and his widow Helen 'Ellen' Shaw next married Sir Patrick Hume, the 2nd Baron Hume of Polwarth, and by him had additional issue.\nAs Archibald died before his father, his title reverted to George.  Upon George's death, the title of Lord Halyburton passed to Archibald's son James, who died having left no heirs.\nThe title next passed to James's uncle, Patrick Haliburton, 6th Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, who was the last Lord Haliburton from the line of Sir John Halyburton, as Patrick left no male heirs.\nAccordingly, the title passed to the heirs male descending from Walter Halyburton, the younger brother of John, 2nd Lord Halyburton.\nGeorge, Lord Haliburton's daughter Marion Haliburton married George Home of Ayton. In 1494 they disputed ownership of the barony of Bolton with Patrick Hepburn, Earl Bothwell, who had a tack or lease of Bolton from Archibald, Master of Haliburton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Haliburton", "response": ["* George Haliburton, 4th Lord Haliburton of Dirleton (died before 1492), Scottish Lord of Parliament"]}, {"page": "Lord Haliburton of Dirleton", "response": ["*George Haliburton, 4th Lord Haliburton of Dirleton (died c. 1492)"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1450\u20131459", "response": ["|George Haliburton, 4th Lord Haliburton of Dirleton||1459||1492||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1460\u20131469", "response": ["|Lord Haliburton of Dirleton (1441)||George Haliburton, 4th Lord Haliburton of Dirleton||1459||1492||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1470\u20131479", "response": ["|Lord Haliburton of Dirleton (1441)||George Haliburton, 4th Lord Haliburton of Dirleton||1459||1492||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1480\u20131489", "response": ["|Lord Haliburton of Dirleton (1441)||George Haliburton, 4th Lord Haliburton of Dirleton||1459||1492||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1490\u20131499", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Lord Haliburton of Dirleton (1441)||George Haliburton, 4th Lord Haliburton of Dirleton||1459||1492||Died"]}]}}
