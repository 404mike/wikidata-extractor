As a result, Joyce's \"official\" debut was delayed until 21 October 1899, in a 5\u20131 victory over Queens Park Rangers. At Southampton, Joyce was an understudy to England international Jack Robinson and Robinson's form meant that Joyce's first-team opportunities were rare. Nonetheless, he was a useful goalkeeper to have in reserve and was able to use his bulk to punt the ball upfield further than any other contemporary goalkeeper. After seven Southern League appearances, in May 1900 Joyce moved to fellow Southern League club Millwall Athletic in search of regular first team football."]}, {"page": "Freemantle F.C.", "response": ["Other players who started their careers at Freemantle include Frank Englefield, James McKie and Henry Small, while Sid Cavendish, Joe French, Ernest Gill and Ernie Taylor all played for Freemantle at some time in their careers."]}, {"page": "1898\u201399 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["| Sid Cavendish"]}, {"page": "Cavendish (surname)", "response": ["*Sid Cavendish (1876\u20131954), English footballer with Southampton and Clapton Orient"]}]}}
