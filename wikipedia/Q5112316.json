The film marked Barker's directorial debut. Its plot involves a mystical puzzle box which summons the Cenobites, a group of extra-dimensional, sadomasochistic beings who cannot differentiate between pain and pleasure. The leader of the Cenobites is portrayed by Doug Bradley, and identified in the sequels as \"Pinhead\".", "Having been dismayed at prior cinematic adaptations of his work, Barker decided to attempt to direct a film himself. Christopher Figg agreed to produce and New World Pictures agreed to fund the film for $900,000.", "Hellraiser was filmed at the end of 1986 and was set to be made in seven weeks, but was extended over a nine- to ten-week period by New World. The film was originally made under the working title of Sadomasochists from Beyond the Grave. Barker also wanted to call the film Hellbound but producer Christopher Figg suggested Hellraiser instead. Barker spoke fondly in The Hellraiser Chronicles about the filming, stating that his memories of production were of \"unalloyed fondness\u00a0... The cast treated my ineptitudes kindly, and the crew were no less forgiving.\" Barker admitted his own lack of knowledge on filmmaking, stating that he \"didn't know the difference between a 10-millimetre lens and a 35-millimetre lens. If you'd shown me a plate of spaghetti and said that was a lens, I might have believed you.\" After filming, New World convinced Barker to relocate the story to the United States which required overdubbing to remove some English accents."]}, {"page": "Hellraiser (franchise)", "response": ["| Christopher Figg", "| Christopher Figg and David Barron"]}, {"page": "The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby", "response": ["Greyfriars Bobby was played by a West Highland White Terrier, when the original dog was in fact a Skye Terrier.Greyfriars Bobby, the book by Eleanor Atkinson: Project Gutenberg website. This casting caused protests from the Skye Terrier breed club, who complained about filmmakers using an incorrect dog breed. Christopher Figg, the producer, said that a Westie was used \"because its white coat would stand out in the dark and because its eyes would not be hidden from the camera by a fringe.\" During the early stages of planning for this film in 2003, Scottish Screen, the national development agency for the Scottish screen industries, had run a lottery worth \u00a3500,000, but withdrew the funding for the film, and it was almost made in Luxembourg instead of Scotland. While Bakehouse Close, off the Royal Mile, was used for the exterior shots of John Gray's family home, the Edinburgh Castle scenes in this film were actually shot in Stirling Castle. There was much filming in and around the old town of Stirling as well as within the grounds of Stirling Castle doubling for old Edinburgh and Greyfriars Kirk Yard as seen in the film is in fact Stirling's Old Town Cemetery with the Church of The Holy Rood in the background."]}, {"page": "Chris Figg", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Figg"]}, {"page": "Figg", "response": ["* Christopher Figg (born 1957), English film producer"]}, {"page": "Figg, Christopher", "response": ["#redirectChristopher Figg"]}, {"page": "Great White (2021 film)", "response": ["Great White is a 2021 Australian survival horror film directed by Martin Wilson, written by Michael Boughen and produced by Neal Kingston and Michael Robertson with executive producers Jack Christian and Christopher Figg.
