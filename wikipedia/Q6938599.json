Her books were illustrated by Nano Reid, Muriel Brandt, Nora McGuinness, and Brian Wildsmith. The little black hen (1940) was reworked into two books by Parkside Press children's series in 1945, The fairy hen and May Eve in fairyland. Each of O'Faolain's stories centre on a set of ordinary children, either set in rural or suburban Ireland, who set off on unexpected adventures and meet eccentric adults, animals and fairies. For her later books in the 1950s, she draws on Irish history, myth and legend, such as Irish sagas and folk-tales (1954), in which she retells the stories of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. Children of the salmon and other Irish folktales (1965) features her translations of stories from Irish recordings by folklorists."]}]}}
