Ash moved back to Australia in 1988 for one year and undertook Year 11 at Sandringham Secondary College in Melbourne.\nAsh began writing music in 1989 on a Commodore Amiga.

Meanwhile, James completed his education at Carshalton College, Carshalton in 1992 and finally emigrated back once again to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nAsh joined Melbourne community based radio station Hitz FM in 1993 as an on-air announcer. He began DJing in clubs in late 1993.\nAsh's first proper DJ gig was at Melbourne venue 'Lazar's' and was acquired after he lied about his skills as a nightclub DJ. He had actually never DJ'ed in a nightclub before. Ash got dragged off after just ten minutes by the manager who told him he was rubbish. He convinced the manager to give him another try next week and came into the venue during the daytimes to practise.\nAsh has been an active member of Australia's DJ fraternity since 1994, and has held residencies at most of Melbourne's leading clubs over the years.\nAsh's first record released was \"Be With Me\" under the name Faith in Technology through Colossal Records.
