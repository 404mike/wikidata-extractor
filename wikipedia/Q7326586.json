Max's arrival had been shortly preceded the appearance of its newest bad-boy character, the ex-prison inmate, Sonny Bennett (Richard Huggett), the brother of popular character Lisa Bennet. Addicted to speed and completely unpredictable, Sonny was also a hit with viewers and he'd been slowly built-up in the scripts with references to him being in prison included in dialogue very early in the series. Writer Alexa Wyatt admitted in an interview for the E Street tribute site that Sonny's eventual introduction was intended to shake up the series again and to remove several established characters that writers felt had run their course. Sonny's dark and dramatic time on E Street climaxed with three members of the Patchett family, Chris, Megan, and Abbey, all perishing in perhaps the most memorable moment of the entire series when they were all killed off in a highly shocking car bomb explosion. Redlich commented at the time:", "We have a lot to thank for the commitment and loyalty of the fans. For them, it seems one of the dramatic highlights was the bathtub scene with Wheels (Marcus Graham) and Lisa (Alyssa-Jane Cook). We still get letters about it. But it has been satisfying for me to know that E Street has given a start to a whole lot of untried actors such as Marcus [Graham], Richard Huggett, Alyssa-Jane [Cook] and Paul Kelman.
