Brennan moulded the team into a major force of British ice hockey of the 1960s in the Northern League. Brennan introduced off-ice fitness programmes for the team in order to allow the best use of ice time for skills and tactical development. He took the team on short European tours during the 1960s, playing against teams from the Canadian Air Force. A number of the players from developed at Paisley during this time went on to achieve international recognition with the GB national team, such as his younger brother, Alastair Brennan, Billy Miller, Jackson McBride and Alistair McRae."]}]}}
