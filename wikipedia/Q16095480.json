However, this is disputed. British diplomat Terence Clark wrote that the Arabic word  indicates 'person or thing from a place named Saluq'. Arab tradition states that Saluq was an ancient town in Yemen not far from modern Ta'izz, and the Arabs associate this town with the origin of the breed. However, the word  might have been derived from reference to several other places: Saluq in Armenia, and three towns called Saluqiyah. One has become modern Silifke, Turkey; another is near Antioch (modern Antakya), Turkey; and third is located near Baghdad, Iraq. Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Persian Empire, which was located some  to the southeast. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed Seleucia, the first capital of the Seleucid Empire (312 BC \u2013 65 AD)."]}, {"page": "Clark", "response": ["* Sir Terence Clark (born 1934), British retired diplomat and writer"]}, {"page": "Parmiter's School", "response": ["* Sir Terence Clark KBE CMG CVO (born 19 June 1934), British retired diplomat and writer."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Iraq", "response": ["*1985\u20131989: Terence Clark"]}, {"page": "1934 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Terence Clark, soldier and diplomat, British Ambassador to Iraq"]}, {"page": "Sharkskin", "response": ["British Diplomat Sir Terence Clark in the 1950s served in Bahrain.
