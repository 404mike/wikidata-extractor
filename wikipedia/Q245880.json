Based on his own original screenplay and co-produced with Thomas, the story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France, in 1940. Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, Nolan wanted to make a \"sensory, almost experimental movie\" with minimal dialogue. He said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, \"knowing and respecting that Chris [Nolan] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama.\" Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, and Kenneth Branagh, Dunkirk was released in theatres in July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results. It grossed over $526million worldwide, which made it the highest-grossing World WarII film of all time. In his review, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \"It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies\u2014they are rare\u2014that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie.\" The film received many accolades, including Nolan's first Oscar nomination for Best Director."]}, {"page": "David Bailey", "response": ["In 2012, the BBC made a film of the story of his 1962 New York photoshoot with Jean Shrimpton, entitled We'll Take Manhattan, starring Aneurin Barnard as Bailey."]}, {"page": "Terence Stamp", "response": ["Stamp's next project was Crooked House (2017), directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner and starring Christina Hendricks, Gillian Anderson and Glenn Close.
