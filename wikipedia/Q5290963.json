He was replaced in 2021 with Sir Trevor McDonald. The show's format consists of a mixture of game reviews, small \"features\", tips and challenges. Challenges form the biggest section of the show and generally consist of \"average\" players and celebrities, often competing against each other for the coveted Golden Joystick. The show was a hit from its initial series with high ratings and an audience made up mostly of adolescent boys, tuning in to hear Diamond's double entendres and sexual innuendos.", "Although it featured game reviews, most of the programme was about challenges where game players would compete against one another for the title of \"GamesMaster Champion\". Contestants who were successful at their challenges were rewarded with the coveted \"GamesMaster Golden Joystick\" trophy.

These included Derrick Lynch, Kirk Ewing, Julian Rignall, Rik Henderson, Dave Perry, Tim Boone and Neil West amongst others.", "Each location the series was set in, a plot device occurred after Auntie Marisha blew up the newly pine-fitted kitchen at the end of series 2, causing the oilrig to be evacuated. Dominik Diamond was later revealed to be burnt to death while trying to escape, giving way to Dexter Fletcher to present series 3, when in reality Diamond left the programme. Diamond would later return in series 4 onwards in Hell and then in Heaven for series 5, continuing on from his whereabouts after his death in series 2 (although the opening title sequence of the fifth series offers an alternative \"death\", with Diamond being run over by a bus and flat-lining while in hospital). He then fell from Heaven in the opening credits to series 6 continuing a bit of continuity there, but that was dropped for the series 7 titles where Diamond travelled to the island setting of series 7 during a dream sequence.", "It is believed that Dominik Diamond, along with the programme's producers, wanted to make a more adult programme that would air in a late night, more mainstream time slot. (Series 8 was going to be set on a pirate ship with buxom wenches as the Golden Joystick assistants.) There was also talk of a spin-off programme being made that would seek to emulate the US talk shows of the time. Whether this would have meant a programme that focused far less on games is unknown. No confirmation exists that any pilots of this concept were ever made; Channel 4 did not see the potential of a gaming programme for an older, adult audience.", "Dominik Diamond returned to games television first as an interviewee in the 1999 documentary Games Wars, in which he commented that boys getting turned on by Lara Croft was tragic and \"desperately sad\". He then returned to presenting in 2004 with a show on Bravo, called When Games Attack. This programme was largely feature-based and contained plenty of Dominik's trademark humour.
