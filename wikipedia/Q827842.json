In 1964, he took an appointment at the University of Manchester. While there, he conducted numerous field surveys and excavations of Roman sites in Lancashire, Cheshire, Cumbria and Derbyshire.

He argues that the ancient interpretation of Etruscan origins has derived from a \"hostile tradition, of rivals and enemies; the Greeks and Romans\". The extent of \"classical prejudice\" is exemplified in early records of the Etruscans. Classical literature typically portrayed Etruscans as 'pirates' and 'freebooters'. Massimo Pallottino points out that their reputation for piracy took shape between the time of Homer and the image shown in the Homeric Hymns, and was clearly a product of the intense commercial and territorial rivalry between the Etruscans and Greek traders. Consequentially Perkins concludes that ancient \"standards of historical criticism were not ours\" in which \"a great deal of it is seen through a veil of interpretation, misunderstanding, and at times, plain invention\".John Bryan Ward-Perkins, The Problem of Etruscan Origins, Harvard University, 1959 The ancient tendency to invent or apply a fabricated account within their historical record is evident in Herodotus' Histories. His use of fanciful story telling contributes to the overarching glorified narrative of Greece in the Persian wars and exemplifies the greatness of Greek conquest. This agenda is problematic when viewing his 'heroic' understanding of Etruscan origins, because Herodotus' stories tend to contribute to the national narrative rather than an intended historical record. His account is seen through, what Perkins refers to as, antiquity's \"distorting mirror\"."]}, {"page": "1975 New Year Honours", "response": ["*John Bryan Ward-Perkins, C.B.E., lately Director of the British School of Art and Archaeology, Rome."]}, {"page": "1955 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* John Bryan Ward-Perkins, Director of the British School at Rome."]}, {"page": "Molly Cotton", "response": ["Her next projects were in Italy, excavating villas at Posto and San Rocco in Francolise, between 1962 and 1965.

He also carried out surveying work on the ancient sites and conducted excavations in the hinterland. In addition, he led several expeditions to southern Tripolitania.
