Stevenage had taken the lead after just seven minutes, a Brett Johnson clearance hit the legs of Lawrie Wilson and deflected past AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper Jack Turner. The home side turned the game around shortly after the interval, scoring twice in the space of four second-half minutes. Former Stevenage player Sam Hatton restored parity from the penalty spot after Darius Charles had fouled Ryan Jackson, before Rashid Yussuff beat Alan Julian with a tidy finish. Stevenage captain Mark Roberts' 20-yard injury-time volley meant that the tie went to penalties, with AFC Wimbledon progressing to the Third Round after Wilson missed the final spot-kick."]}, {"page": "AFC Wimbledon Development Squad and Academy", "response": ["*  Jack Turner"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 National League", "response": ["|Jack Turner"]}]}}
