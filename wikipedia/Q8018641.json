At the 1891 census, the settlement had a population of just 55 people. His elder siblings had been born in Ballarat, where his father was a locomotive painter at the Phoenix Foundry. Seeking a new start, he moved the family to Jeparit to take over the general store, which \"survived rather than prospered\". During Menzies's childhood, three of his close relatives were elected to parliament. His uncle Hugh was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1902, followed by his father in 1911, while another uncle, Sydney Sampson, was elected to the federal House of Representatives in 1906. Each of the three represented rural constituencies, and were defeated after a few terms. Menzies's maternal grandfather John Sampson was active in the trade union movement. He was the inaugural president of the Creswick Miners' Association, which he co-founded with future Labor MP William Spence, and was later prominent in the Amalgamated Miners' Association."]}, {"page": "Andrew Fisher", "response": ["At the 1906 election, Deakin remained Prime Minister even though Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher was considered to have a better understanding of economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was more in touch with party opinion. He did not share Hughes' passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). In political terms he was a radical, on the left-wing of his party, with a strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history."]}, {"page": "Eday", "response": ["* Australian pioneer union leader and Australian Labor Party politician, William Spence was born on Eday in 1846."]}, {"page": "William Guthrie Spence", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Spence"]}, {"page": "Third Fisher Ministry", "response": ["| Hon William Spence "]}, {"page": "Second Hughes Ministry", "response": ["| Hon William Spence "]}, {"page": "Australian Workers' Union", "response": ["The AWU grew from a number of earlier unions, notably the Australasian Shearers' Union, founded by William Spence, Alexander Poynton (OBE, an inaugural member of the Australian House of Representatives), brother Charles Poynton, and David Temple in Creswick, Victoria in 1886.Smith, Bruce A. created 20 April 2001, last modified 6 August 2010.

Trade unions had been formed in New South Wales as early as the 1850s, but it was great labour struggles of the 1890s that led them to move into politics. The most important was the Australian Workers' Union (AWU), formed from earlier unions by William Spence and others in 1894. The defeat of the great shearers' and maritime strikes in the 1890s led the AWU to reject direct action and to take the lead in forming the Labor Party. Labor had its first great success in 1891, when it won 35 seats in the Legislative Assembly, mainly in the pastoral and mining areas. This first parliamentary Labor Party, led by Joseph Cook, supported Reid's Free Trade government, but broke up over the issue of free trade versus protection, and also over the \"pledge\" which the unions required Labor members to take always to vote in accordance with majority decisions. After federation, Labor, led by James McGowen, soon recovered, and won its first majority in the Assembly in 1910, when McGowen became the state's first Labor Premier."]}, {"page": "1901 Australian federal election", "response": ["| align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"FFCCCC\" |William Spence"]}, {"page": "1926 in Australia", "response": ["*13 December \u2013 William Spence (born 1846), trade union leader and politician"]}, {"page": "W.G.
