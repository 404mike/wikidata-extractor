He played his early football for Thornliebank, a club based in the south of the city of Glasgow, Scotland and appeared as a 16 year old in the 1880 Scottish Cup Final. Thornliebank were beaten 3\u20130 by Queen's Park, and McFettridge played centre-half. In 1883 he moved to England to play for Padiham, then a power in Lancashire football. In 1886 he transferred to Burnley.\nMcFettridge soon established himself in the Burnley team and showed himself to be a versatile player with an ability to play in attack or defence. However, he soon made the right-half position his own and built a strong relationship with left-half Jack Keenan. He played with a hard, robust style proving very effective in those early days.", "link_mentions": {}}}
