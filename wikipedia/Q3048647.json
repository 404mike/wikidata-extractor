Another client was the Doves Press, whose Doves Type he cut; it was famously thrown into the Thames following a business disagreement. A somewhat retiring figure, only two photographs of him are known to exist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Punchcutting", "response": ["Some punchcutters did continue to hold prestige for their artisanal work into the early or mid-twentieth century. These included Edward Prince, who cut many types for Arts and Crafts movement fine printers, Malin in Paris, Otto Erler in Leipzig and P. H. R\u00e4disch at Joh. Ensched\u00e9 in Haarlem, who cut the types of Jan van Krimpen. Type designer Matthew Carter, who learned punchcutting from R\u00e4disch while at an internship at Ensched\u00e9, has added commentary to a silent film of R\u00e4disch at work in the 1950s."]}, {"page": "Doves Press", "response": ["Cobden-Sanderson commissioned the press's type, which was drawn under Walker's supervision, and the Doves Bindery which he had set up in 1893 bound the books he and Walker printed. The Press produced all its books using a single size of this type, between 1900 and 1916, and is considered to have been a significant contributor to the Arts and Crafts movement. The founders were associated with William Morris and the Kelmscott Press. The Doves type was based on types used by Nicolas Jenson from the 1470s, similar to Morris's earlier Golden Type, and like it cut by punchcutter Edward Prince.Naylor, Gillian: \"The things that might be: British design after Morris\".
