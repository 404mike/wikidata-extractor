The match ended as a 1\u20131 draw after referee Stuart Attwell disallowed two Derby goals in the final few minutes. Atwell also booked eight players and issued a straight red card to Forest midfielder Lewis McGugan. Jewell was especially vocal in his dismay at Attwell's performance, accusing the 25-year-old official of 'losing control' of the game and 'robbing' the Rams of a victory. The press furore around his display saw Attwell called in for a meeting with Referee's Chief Keith Hackett and was consequently axed from the following week's fixture list. Days after the game Derby manager Paul Jewell said that a member of the Football Association had contacted him and told him that the second goal should have stood. The Attwell controversy overshadowed Derby's run of only one defeat in 11 and their retention of the Brian Clough Trophy. It also stretched Derby's unbeaten streak against Forest to five, having lost just once to their rivals in the last 11 meetings.

The club's dip in form saw Jewell making vocal his desire to bring fresh legs and impetus into a squad being hit by injuries and a busy fixture list, whilst assistant manager Chris Hutchings called for greater 'consistency'.
