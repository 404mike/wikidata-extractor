His on-field performances were regarded as excellent, and he won Reading's player of the year award in both of his full seasons there, as well as being the leading goal scorer. However, his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record, and his personal life was one of heavy smoking, drinking, womanising and drug abuse. Despite his short career, he remains prominent in the memory of Reading and Cardiff supporters, both as a player and a personality. He has been voted Reading's best ever player three times.\nBorn and raised in Acton, West London, Friday was scouted, but not retained, by four professional clubs during his teenage years. He appeared for local semi-professional sides in the Isthmian League until he joined Charlie Hurley's Fourth Division Reading team in 1974; quickly becoming a key player, he helped Reading to win promotion to the Third Division during the 1975\u201376 season. As his drug habit intensified, Friday's form began to dip in the first half of the 1976\u201377 season, leading Reading to sell him to Second Division side Cardiff City around the New Year. Friday travelled to join his new team by train without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by the Cardiff manager Jimmy Andrews before he signed for the club. He performed strongly on his debut, but afterwards his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether. Following a number of incidents, on and off the field\u2014including kicking Mark Lawrenson in the face mid-game\u2014Friday retired from football in December 1977, aged 25. He died in Acton in 1990, aged 38, after suffering a heart attack.\nThe strongest aspects of Friday's game were his ball skills, footballing intelligence and physical and mental strength. Andrews labelled Friday \"the complete centre-forward\", and, along with numerous contemporaries, retrospectively rated Friday as good enough for the England national team. In a 2004 BBC poll, Friday was voted the top \"all-time cult hero\" for both Reading and Cardiff City. The Cardiff-based band Super Furry Animals dedicated their 1996 single \"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\" to his memory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Acton, London", "response": ["* Robin Friday, former footballer, was born and lived in Acton."]}, {"page": "Reading F.C.", "response": ["| Robin Friday"]}, {"page": "HM Prison Pentonville", "response": ["* 1977: Robin Friday, football player with Cardiff City F.C. was arrested for impersonating a police officer at Piccadilly Circus.

One of his greatest moments was in the 4th round of the F.A. Cup in February 1972, when he guided Reading, then a  4th division outfit to a 4th-round meeting with the great double-winning Arsenal side. Over 20,000 people packed into Elm Park, and Charlie's charges narrowly lost 2\u20131 to a side containing George Graham, Charlie George,  Geordie Armstrong, Bob Wilson, Frank McLintock and other international-class players.

After a 1\u20131 draw Sunderland won the replay 3\u20131. The following spring the Reading manager took a gamble by purchasing Robin Friday from non-league Hayes F.C.. Friday should have been playing in the top flight, but his temperament, drinking and smoking were a major handicap. Hurley was the only man to ever get the best out of Friday and in 1975\u201376 Reading won promotion, with Friday often playing brilliantly. The star of the Reading side was determined to move on, and Hurley allowed him to move to Cardiff for \u00a330,000 before the start of the season, where he faded away and was eventually lost to the game. He died of a heart attack at just 38. Reading struggled without their best player, and, as they plummeted back to the lower flight, Hurley quit on 26 February 1977."]}, {"page": "Hayes F.C.", "response": ["The club claimed some respectable cup triumphs, among the most noteworthy being those against Fulham a 2-0 win at Craven Cottage in November 1991, Bristol Rovers 1-0 in 1972-73 and Cardiff City 1-0, in a replay staged at Brentford in November 1990. In 1999 they missed out on a lucrative third-round tie with Chelsea after defeat in extra time to Hull City.
