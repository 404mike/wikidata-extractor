In 1849, Dr Joseph Angus (Principal 1849\u20131893) became Principal at just 33\u00a0years old.Gould, 1910, p. 56. At the beginning of his time as Principal, Angus  admitted a small number of lay students to college. His belief was that it would benefit the ministerial students to have contact with them as well as bringing much needed finances to the Academy."]}, {"page": "World Anti-Slavery Convention", "response": ["| MorganWilliam Harris Murch || UK || yes || Minister"]}, {"page": "Joseph Angus", "response": ["The only son of John Angus, a farmer and later a leather merchant, by his wife Elizabeth Wanless, he was born at Bolam, Northumberland.
