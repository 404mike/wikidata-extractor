His surname is sometimes spelt as Cautherly.\nBorn to the actress Jane Green, he was reputed to be the son of David Garrick, actor-manager at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Cautherley began appearing there as a child actor. Sent away to school he quickly returned again to the stage in 1760 and, after another short period away, in 1765. Despite the assistance of Garrick, he was often criticised in the press. He played Charles Dudley in Cumberland's The West Indian and appeared in a mixture of lead and supporting roles until falling out with Garrick in 1775, after which he quit the stage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "False Delicacy", "response": ["The original Drury Lane cast included Thomas King as Cecil, Samuel Reddish as Lord Winworth, Charles Holland as Colonel Rivers, John Palmer as Sir Harry Newburgh, Samuel Cautherley as Sidney, Frances Abington as Lady Betty Lambton, Ann Street Barry as Mrs Harley and Sophia Baddeley as Miss Marchont.
