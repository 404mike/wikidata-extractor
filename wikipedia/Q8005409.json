They went on painting trips to beauty spots in north Wales, the north of England and Scotland, with David Cox Jnr (Cox's son) and other artist friends. In 1848 he was made a member of the New Water-Colour Society, and contributed landscapes, chiefly of English scenery, to their exhibitions, until his death in 1871. He also exhibited at the Royal Academy (RA), British Institution (BI) and the Royal Society of British Artists (RBA).Bennett learnt from Cox the ability to draw with speed, and worked with a restricted range of colours, achieving his artistic effect by \"the quickest and most dexterous use of a large brush full of colour dashed with hurried certainty over the roughest paper\". In this way he achieved the effect of portraying the initial impact of the scene to the artist, but at the expense of accuracy.Bennett lived for a period at \"Milford Lodge\", New Park Road, in Clapham Park, London (the house has since been demolished); next door but one to David Cox Jnr and his family, who lived at \"no. 82\" from 1860. He died in 1871 and is buried at West Norwood Cemetery, London. One of Bennett's pupils was Alfred Williams (1832\u20131905).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richmond Park", "response": ["William Bennett's watercolour In Richmond Park, painted in 1852, is held by Tate Britain.

By 1850 Bennett in particular had become recognised as \"perhaps the most distinguished among the landscape painters\" for his Cox-like vigorous and decisive style. Such early followers concentrated on the example of Cox's more moderate earlier work and steered clear of what were then seen as the excesses of Cox's later years. During a period dominated by sleek and detailed picturesque landscape, however, they were still condemned by publications such as The Spectator as \"the 'blottesque' school\", and failed to establish themselves as a cohesive movement."]}, {"page": "William Bennett (disambiguation)", "response": ["William Bennett (born 1943) is an American conservative pundit, political theorist and former Secretary of Education.", "*William Bennett (English politician) (1873\u20131937), Member of Parliament for Battersea South, 1929\u20131931", "*William Bennett, Mayor of Rockford, Illinois, 1911\u20131917", "*William Bennett (Australian politician) (1843\u20131929), member of the Tasmanian Parliament", "*William Bennett (oboist) (1956\u20132013), San Francisco Symphony oboist", "*William Bennett (flautist) (born 1936), British flute player", "*William Bennett, British experimental musician and founding member of Whitehouse and Cut Hands", "*William Bennett (headmaster), teacher and teachers' representative in South Australia", "*William Bennett (clergyman) (\u20131857), British-born Methodist minister", "*William Bennett (cricketer) (1807\u20131886), cricketer", "*William Bennett (footballer) (1896\u2013?), English footballer with Nelson", "*William Bennett (football manager), Cuban football manager", "*William Bennett (painter) (1811\u20131871), English watercolour painter", "*William Bennett (Australian engineer) (1824\u20131889), (William Christopher Bennett) Irish-Australian surveyor and engineer"]}]}}
