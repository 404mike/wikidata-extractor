He was known as the \"Demon of Frome\", a nickname coined by journalist, Alan Gibson.\nColin Dredge made his debut for Somerset on 16 June 1976 against Worcester and was awarded his Somerset Cap in 1978. He made useful contributions as a regular for the County side until 1986. He played 194 first-class matches and 209 one-day matches, including 4 one-day finals, winning the Benson & Hedges Cup in 1981 and 1982 and the Nat West Trophy in 1983.  Dredge was not selected for the final of the Gillette Cup in 1979, but played the following day in the crucial win over Nottinghamshire which clinched the John Player Trophy . For much of his career he was overshadowed by Test bowlers Joel Garner, Ian Botham and Vic Marks, but he did win one man-of -the-match award by taking 4-23 against Kent in the 1978 Gillette Cup quarter-final. In 3-day matches he took over 50 wickets in a season 4 times, including 63 in 1980 when he took 5 wickets in an innings on 5 occasions. Batting as a tailender, he made 4 scores over 50 and he took 84 catches.\nDredge had seven brothers, all of whom played for Frome. He still lives in the town, working in Westbury for Network Rail.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frome", "response": ["* The cricketer Colin Dredge was born in Frome in 1954."]}, {"page": "Alan Gibson", "response": ["In his pieces he coined the descriptions \"the Sage of Longparish\" for his colleague John Woodcock, \"the Demon of Frome\" for Colin Dredge of Somerset, the Old Bald Blighter (the OBB) for Brian Close and \"the Shoreditch Sparrow\" for Robin Jackman.

In their second round match against Glamorgan, Somerset scored 330 for 4, the highest total in that year's competition. Peter Denning scored 145 runs, while Joel Garner bowled six overs and conceded just five runs. Garner's bowling was once again miserly in the quarter-final against Kent; he conceded five runs in nine overs, though Colin Dredge was named as the man of the match for his four wickets, which helped Somerset to a five-wicket victory. In the semi-final, Somerset batted first, and helped by another century from Richards, scored 287 for 6. In their response, Essex kept up with the required run rate, and needed three runs to win from the final ball of the match. The batsmen managed two runs, but Neil Smith was run out attempting the third run, and as a result the scores were tied.

The same thing happened in Watford, where Glamorgan and the Minor Counties were due to play. Although it was overcast and slightly wet the next morning, play started on time. Rose won the toss for Somerset and chose to bat, opening the batting himself alongside Peter Denning. Worcestershire's Vanburn Holder bowled the first over, which consisted of seven deliveries as it included a no-ball, to Rose, who did not play any scoring shots. The Somerset captain declared the innings closed at the end of the over. Somerset had scored just one run, which they were awarded for the no-ball, and Worcestershire only needed two runs to win. The players left the field for the ten-minute break between innings, and when they returned Glenn Turner and Alan Ormrod opened Worcestershire's batting.

Somerset captain Rose won the toss and chose to field first in overcast conditions. Joel Garner opened the bowling for Somerset, and after keeping Paul Todd on his back foot during his first over, he bowled him with a yorker in the second over, leaving Nottinghamshire three for one. Tim Robinson and Derek Randall batted through until the seventeenth over, moving the score onto 40 for one, before Robinson was caught at mid-wicket by Viv Richards off the bowling of Colin Dredge for 13. The next over, Randall was bowled for 19, attempting to cut Vic Marks' second delivery, and having lost two wickets without scoring, Nottinghamshire were 40 for three. Basher Hassan and Clive Rice built a partnership, moving the score onto 86, until Rice got out just before lunch. Rice had been targeting the bowling of Marks; he had previously driven him for six, but attacking a similar ball he moved forwards out of his crease to try the same stroke, but was bowled. Hassan was later caught behind off the bowling of Dredge. Garner, whose first spell had been described by The Observers Scyld Berry as \"relatively expensive\", claimed two more wickets with yorkers, while Ian Botham and Hallam Moseley each also took a wicket with yorkers. Of Nottinghamshire's final six batsmen, only Richard Hadlee reached double figures, and they were bowled out for 130; the lowest total in a Benson & Hedges Cup final at the time. The journalist Paul Fitzpatrick suggested that Nottinghamshire had been unable \"to cope with the occasion or the pressure.\" Marks was praised by Henry Blofeld of The Guardian for his \"subtle variations of pace and flight\", while Berry said that he \"cleverly exploited [the Nottinghamshire batsmen's] hesitancy by giving far more flight to his off-spin than is customary in a limited-overs game.\" Marks finished the innings with two wickets, and conceded 24 runs, and Garner took three wickets for 13 runs.", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Viv Richards b Colin Dredge || 13", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Derek Taylor  b Colin Dredge || 26", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Colin Dredge", "| colspan=\"3\" | Did not bat: Brian Rose, Ian Botham, Vic Marks, Nigel Popplewell, Derek Taylor, Joel Garner, Colin Dredge, Hallam Moseley"]}]}}
