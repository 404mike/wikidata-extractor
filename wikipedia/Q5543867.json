The duties on salt and glass specially illustrated the bad results of the excise. New processes were hindered and routine made compulsory. The customs duties were still more restrictive of trade; as they practically excluded foreign manufactures, and were both costly and in many instances unproductive of revenue. As George Richardson Porter showed in Progress of the Nation (1851), the really profitable customs taxes were few in number. Less than a score of articles contributed more than 95% the revenue from import duties. The duties on transactions, levied chiefly by stamps, were ill-graded and lacking in comprehensiveness."]}, {"page": "George Porter (disambiguation)", "response": ["*George Richardson Porter (1792\u20131852), British statistician"]}, {"page": "Penny Cyclopaedia", "response": ["The contributors to the Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia were not individually credited with the articles they created, although a list of their names appears in volume 27.
