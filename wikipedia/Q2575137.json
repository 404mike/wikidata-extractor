He favours the inclusion in this category of one Aurelius Caninus (\"Aurelius the dog-like\"), whom Gildas accuses of parricide, fornication, adultery, and warmongering. His name \"Aurelius\" suggests Romano-British descent. The insulting nickname \"Caninus\" was probably invented by Gildas himself, who similarly insults other contemporary rulers. Due to the name used by Gildas, there are theories that this ruler was actually named Conan/Cynan/Kenan. Some identify him with Cynan Garwyn, a 6th-century King of Powys, though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of Gildas or lived one or two generations following him. Another theory is that this ruler did not reign in Britain but in Brittany. Caninus, in this view, might be Conomor (\"Great Dog\"). Conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of Gildas. Conomor was likely from Domnon\u00e9e, an area of Brittany controlled by British immigrants from Dumnonia. He might be remembered in British legend as Mark of Cornwall."]}, {"page": "610", "response": ["* Selyf ap Cynan succeeds his father Cynan Garwyn as king of Powys (Wales)."]}, {"page": "List of rulers of Wales", "response": ["* Cynan Garwyn (?\u2013610)"]}, {"page": "Taliesin", "response": ["In 1960, Ifor Williams identified eleven of the medieval poems ascribed to Taliesin as possibly originating as early as the sixth century, and so possibly being composed by a historical Taliesin.The Poems of Taliesin, ed. by Ifor Williams, trans. by J.
