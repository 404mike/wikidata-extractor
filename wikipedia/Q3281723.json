The opening game with England turned out to be the championship decider. While Lewis Jones was off the pitch receiving treatment for an injury, England took the numerical advantage scoring two tries through Albert Agar and Ted Woodward. In the second half the Welsh forwards dominated, especially in the line out, and in the resulting pressure Jones scored two tries, one converted by Malcolm Thomas, which gave Wales victory.Godwin (1984), pg 245. The matches against Ireland and Scotland were won without Wales hitting their best form, and the final match against France was won despite the poor Welsh kicking. Jones had now collected his second Grand Slam trophy with Wales, and had played 25 consecutive games for his country.Godwin (1984), pg 248."]}, {"page": "1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia", "response": ["|Malcolm Thomas ||Wing|||| Newport|| 3"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Thomas (rugby)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Malcolm Thomas (rugby union)"]}]}}
