He then joined Kent for the 2005 season. He made a very good start to his Kent career, scoring over 1,000 runs in a season for the first time in his career. 2006 proved to be disappointing by comparison, yet he still averaged 39. His performances in the Pro40 League, however, brought Kent to the verge of promotion."]}, {"page": "George Walker (cricketer, born 1984)", "response": ["Walker made his debut in county cricket for Norfolk against Suffolk in the 2000 Minor Counties Championship.
