Son of a British East India Company physician and surgeon, he entered the service of the Company in Bengal in 1743.  He was regarded as an authority on India.\nHe was appointed as a Member of the Council at Fort St. George, Madras, between 1754 and 1758. In that capacity he was instrumental in the sending of a young Robert Clive as the head of a punitive expedition in 1757 to Calcutta, after the Black Hole incident of 1756. He returned to England in 1760, and was appointed as historiographer to the British East India Company in 1769.\nOrme wrote A History of the Military Transactions of the British Nation in Indostan from 1745 (1763\u201378). He also published Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire, the Morattoes and English Concerns in Indostan from the year 1659 (1782).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Clive", "response": ["Robert Clive was not in southern India for many of these events.

It seems to have been through his influence that the nawab gave reluctant consent to Clive's attack on Chandernagore. Later, when the treaty with Mir Jafar was being negotiated circa 1757, he put in a claim for 5% on all the treasure to be recovered, under threat of disclosing the plot. To defeat him, two copies of the treaty were drawn up: the one, the true treaty, omitting his claim; the other containing it, to be shown to him, which Admiral Charles Watson refused to sign, but Clive directed the admiral's signature to be appended. When the truth was revealed to Omichund after Plassey, Macaulay states (following Robert Orme) that he sank gradually into idiocy, languished a few months, and then purportedly died. However, as a matter of fact, he survived for ten years, until 1767; and by his will he bequeathed \u00a32000 to the Foundling Hospital (where his name may be seen in the list of benefactors as \u201ca black merchant of Calcutta\u201d) and also to the Magdalen Hospital in London."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Robert Orme (1728\u20131801), British historian of India"]}, {"page": "Sir Robert Palk, 1st Baronet", "response": ["In 1752 Robert Palk was appointed to the lucrative position of \"Paymaster and Commissary in the Field\" to Lawrence's army.

The cantonment then comprised the present day areas of Cantonment, Tiruchirappalli Junction, Senthaneerpuram, Varahaneri, Golden Rock, Tiruchirapalli Central Prison and other major parts of southern and eastern trichy. During 1878, when the Afghan War broke, the whole of the European troops were withdrawn. According to Oral lore, some parts of the barracks were converted to dispensary and clinic. Later, the buildings were transformed for Cholera/T.B. Hospital and again as barracks and again to hospital, which was mostly devoted and preferred for the Europeans and Anglo-Indians. Around the 1920s, provision was contemplated for a Railway School since there were considerations to move the railway workshop from Negapatnam to Trichinopoly, for strategic purposes, for which foundations were laid in 1926 and permanently moved in 1928. Around the same time, two Railway schools at primary level in English Medium and Tamil Medium were established during 1923 and 1925 respectively along with an exclusive Divisional Railway Hospital was also set up and started to function here since 1927. Post-independence the administration was transferred to Indian Railways, which opened many more such schools, where quality education is provided at subsidized cost to about one lakh children of railway employees and about 30,000 non-railway wards. There are about 5,500 teachers and about 1,100 non-teaching staff employed in these railway schools. Indian Railways also supports many Kendriya Vidyalayas for the benefit of wards of railway employees."]}, {"page": "Orme (name)", "response": ["*Robert Orme (1728\u20131801), British military historian"]}, {"page": "Robert Orme (soldier)", "response": ["thumb|Joshua Reynolds, Robert Orme, 1756.
