He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler although he has also bowled off-spin in his second and final Test match against India in Mohali.\nJames grew up playing club cricket at Corley CC and established himself as a hard hitting fast bowling all rounder creating batting as well as bowling records.  He also played a few games for rivals Fillongley CC and memorably felled Fillongley stalwart Geoff Myton, who was innocently standing at second slip.\nOrmond made his first-class debut in 1995 for Leicestershire County Cricket Club and played a part in the successful championship seasons of 1996 and 1998. Ormond had several consistent seasons at Leicestershire which saw him get rewarded with representation for England at Under-19 level and places on England A tours of Kenya and Sri Lanka.\nOrmond eventually made his full Test debut against Australia in 2001. He was then picked for the tour of India where he played his second and final Test match. His two Test wickets were Ricky Ponting and Rahul Dravid, who both went on to score 12,000 Test runs. He was ostensibly dropped for lack of form, though many suspected that new coach Duncan Fletcher's obsession with fitness actually led to his being culled from the squad.\nAfter he returned to England he moved from Leicestershire to Surrey, where he won another County Championship title in his first season. He remained at the club until the end of the 2009 season when he was released. He is presently cricket coach at Stockport Grammar School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["*  James Ormond"]}, {"page": "2003 Twenty20 Cup", "response": ["The inaugural Twenty20 match was contested between Hampshire Hawks and Sussex Sharks at The Rose Bowl on 13 June 2003.
