Beleaguered by a number of serious injuries which cut-short his professional aspirations, he thereafter forged a career in non-league football with clubs such as Woking, Lewes, Grays Athletic, Maidstone United, Croydon Athletic, Dorchester Town and Kingstonian.During his time at Arsenal he made three appearances for the England Under-21 international team. He was a member of the last time Arsenal fielded an all English team in a Premier League game, in a 1\u20131 draw at home against Wimbledon on 19 April 1994.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maidstone United F.C.", "response": ["*  Ian Selley"]}, {"page": "Paul Davis (footballer, born 1961)", "response": ["Davis had forced his way back into the team starting 21 league games in 1993-94.

In an Arsenal midfield depleted of John Jensen and David Hillier, Morrow was called up at the last minute and made his first appearance in the competition that season, partnering 20-year-old Ian Selley, and veteran Paul Davis in central midfield, as Arsenal beat Parma 1\u20130 with an Alan Smith goal.
