At the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election, Boyd was elected for the UK Unionist Party (UKUP) to represent South Antrim.\nIn January 1999, he joined three of the four other UKUP Assembly members in forming the Northern Ireland Unionist Party. He acted as whip for the new group, and was selected to stand for Westminster under his new party label at the 2000 South Antrim by-election, but withdrew during the campaign, calling on his supporters to back the Democratic Unionist Party candidate William McCrea.  He did stand for the South Antrim seat at the 2001 general election, but came bottom of the poll, with only 972 votes.  He also failed to be elected to Newtownabbey Borough Council.\nAt the 2003 Assembly election, Boyd was able to take only 774 votes, and lost his seat, along with all his party colleagues.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northern Ireland Unionist Party", "response": ["The Northern Ireland Unionist Party (NIUP) was a small political party in Northern Ireland. It was formed in January 1999 as a splinter party from the UK Unionist Party (UKUP). This split was caused by disagreement between the five UKUP members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Four of the members disagreed with UKUP leader Robert McCartney's policy of resigning from the Assembly should Sinn F\u00e9in become part of the power-sharing executive. Cedric Wilson, Patrick Roche, Norman Boyd and Roger Hutchinson disagreed with McCartney, wanting to remain in the Assembly to challenge unionists in favour of the Belfast Agreement. McCartney disciplined these members in their absence and, in response, they left the UKUP and formed the NIUP. Led by Wilson, the new party argued that it had the support of the grassroots membership of the UKUP, but McCartney disputed this."]}, {"page": "Robert McCartney (Northern Irish politician)", "response": ["He opposed the subsequent Belfast Agreement in the May 1998 referendum and his party won five seats in the Assembly elections later that year (McCartney himself in North Down, Cedric Wilson in Strangford, Patrick Roche in Lagan Valley, Norman Boyd in South Antrim and Roger Hutchinson in East Antrim)."]}, {"page": "2000 South Antrim by-election", "response": ["The Northern Ireland Unionist Party initially selected Norman Boyd, who was a local member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (elected as a member of the United Kingdom Unionist Party).
