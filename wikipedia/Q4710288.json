Gardner, who was profoundly deaf, was spotted by Birmingham playing for BSA Sports in the Birmingham Works League. He went on to make 120 appearances in all competitions for Birmingham in eleven years. Gardner died in Birmingham in April 1923; his death, at the age of 36, was registered in the Kings Norton district, which covered much of south Birmingham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of deaf people", "response": ["*Albert Gardner, English midfielder"]}, {"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Albert Gardner \u2013 Footballer"]}, {"page": "James Bumphrey", "response": ["In March 1911, he was brought into the side at wing half in place of the injured Albert Gardner, and rarely returned to the forward line. He missed six weeks in the middle of the 1911\u201312 season with a leg injury, came back in the previously \"problem\" position of left half, where his \"consistently good form [did] much to add strength and reliability to the intermediate line\", and played all but four matches in 1912\u201313. A Birmingham Gazette appraisal in December 1912 describes him as not just \"a vigorous player, who can both take and give a knock\", but also skilful in recovering the ball by anticipating his opponent's movements and quick to feed the ball forward. He was prepared to make an attack himself, possessed a powerful shot, and was willing to track back to support his full backs in time of need. \"To sum up Bumphrey's play, one might say that he is a good, all-round half-back, and always reliable.\" Despite his lack of height, he headed the ball well."]}, {"page": "1909\u201310 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-six players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were ten different goalscorers. Forward Charlie Millington played in 36 of the 39 matches over the season, and half-back Albert Gardner appeared in one fewer.
