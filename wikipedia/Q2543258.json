He collected numerous specimens of natural history and had them painted by Indian artists. From these paintings many new species were described. Several of these species are named after him. On returning to England he collaborated with the zoologist John Edward Gray to publish Illustrations of Indian Zoology (1830\u20131835).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Red panda", "response": ["*by Thomas Hardwicke in 1827 from the Himalayas who explained: \"It is frequently discovered by its loud cry or call, resembling the word \u2018Wha\u2019, often repeating the same: hence is derived one of the local names by which it is known.

Two years later, Johann Friedrich von Brandt proposed a new species under the name Felis r\u00fcppelii, recognising the distinctness of the Egyptian jungle cat. The same year, a stuffed cat was presented at a meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal that had been caught in the jungles of Midnapore in West Bengal, India. J. T. Pearson, who donated the specimen, proposed the name Felis kutas, noting that it differed in colouration from Felis chaus.
