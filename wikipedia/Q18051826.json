In 1977 he finished fourth in the Penfold PGA Championship and third in the Martini International behind a young Greg Norman.McClelland was twice in contention for a Ryder Cup place. In 1973 he finished 22nd in the Ryder Cup points list but was a possible choice having shown good form in the tournaments just before the four selections were made.

In 1977 McClelland finished 10th in the points list but the selectors chose two experienced players, Tony Jacklin and Neil Coles, together with two rookies, Ken Brown and Mark James, who had finished 9th and 11th in the points list.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neil Coles", "response": ["| Doug McClelland ", "*1980 Sunningdale Foursomes (with Doug McClelland)"]}, {"page": "Doug McClelland", "response": ["Born on 5 August 1926 in the western Sydney suburb of Wentworthville, Doug McClelland was the son of Gertrude Amy (n\u00e9e Cooksley) and Alfred McClelland.
