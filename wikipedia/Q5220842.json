Buckle oversaw five wins in eight games as Luton reached the play-off final, though ultimately lost to York City. Buckle quickly began moulding his own team for the 2012\u201313 season, releasing 14 players and signing eight new ones, although two signings in the form of Garry Richards and Danny Spiller did not play a single game as they both suffered long-term injuries.

However, the club's league form soon nosedived and they went on to win only three league games over the course of the next four months. Victories over higher-league opponents Wolverhampton Wanderers and Norwich City in the FA Cup gave some respite, but \"genuine personal reasons\" saw Paul Buckle leave the club in February. Under his replacement, John Still, performances and results gradually picked up to culminate in a late five-game unbeaten run, but the club could not challenge for a play-off finish and ended the season in a club-record low of seventh place.", "The opening of the transfer window on 1 July saw Southport players Andy Parry and Shaun Whalley sign for undisclosed fees, and out-of-contract Histon duo Danny Fitzsimons and Jim Stevenson also join the club.
