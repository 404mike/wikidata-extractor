He relieved the monotony by collecting insect specimens, in the course of which he discovered a new species. He took his collection of around 1500 specimens with him when he returned to Britain where it is known as The Graham Howarth PoW collection at the Natural History Museum and occupies 13 trays. In 1941, while still in England, he was a volunteer firefighter during the London Blitz and was awarded the British Empire Medal for saving the life of another firefighter.  The butterfly genus Howarthia is named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ornithoptera chimaera", "response": ["*Thomas Graham Howarth, 1977 A list of the type-specimens of Ornithoptera (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) in the British Museum (Natural History) Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History).
