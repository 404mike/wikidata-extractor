His career cut short by injuries, he embarked on a political career, holding offices as a commissioner of the navy and was a Member of Parliament.\nSt Lo entered on a naval career, and after service in the Mediterranean on several ships, rose to the rank of captain with his own commands. Controversy occasionally followed his career, such as an investigation on murder charges while a lieutenant. He supported the Glorious Revolution in 1688, claiming to have had an important part in its success. His active seagoing career came to an end after 1689, when his ship was captured by French warship and St Lo was wounded. After time in France as a prisoner of war, he returned to England and took up various political positions, while writing about his observations and thoughts on naval administration. Holding administrative posts, and serving as commissioner for some of the dockyards, he was also an extra commissioner for the navy. As commissioner at Plymouth he had an important role in supporting the construction of the first Eddystone Lighthouse, but when he sent the project's guardship away, the crew and the architect, Henry Winstanley, were promptly captured by a French privateer. Though the men were eventually released, perhaps by the personal intervention of Louis XIV of France, St Lo was reprimanded.\nSt Lo entered parliamentary politics in 1701, sitting for the constituency of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. He supported the Tory interest, until his defeat in 1705. He continued his administrative career until the accession of King George I in 1716, and was left unemployed in the subsequent redistribution of posts. He died two years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 19", "response": ["*1655 \u2013 George St Lo(e), Royal Navy officer and administrator (d. 1718)"]}, {"page": "1655", "response": ["* April 19 \u2013 George St Lo, Royal Navy officer and administrator (d. 1718)"]}, {"page": "1718", "response": ["* September 20 \u2013 George St Lo, Royal Navy officer and administrator (b. 1655)"]}, {"page": "Chatham Dockyard", "response": ["* Commissioner's House 1704.

The octagonal tower was to be built from Cornish granite and wood, with ornamental features and a glass lantern-room in which candles would burn to provide the light, and was to be anchored to the rock by 12 huge iron stanchions.  One notable incident during its construction occurred in June 1697.  At this time Britain and France were at war, and a naval vessel had been assigned to protect the workers whenever they were on the reef.  On this particular day, the commissioner at Plymouth, George St Lo, ordered the ship to join the fleet and did not provide a replacement. Instead, a French privateer destroyed the work done so far on the foundations and carried Winstanley off to France. Louis XIV, however, ordered his immediate release, with the words: \"France is at war with England, not with humanity\".  Winstanley returned to the Eddystone reef, construction resumed, and the first Eddystone Lighthouse was completed in November 1698."]}, {"page": "HMNB Devonport", "response": ["* Captain George St Lo (appointed 26 March 1695)"]}, {"page": "George St Loe", "response": ["#REDIRECT George St Lo"]}, {"page": "George St. Lo", "response": ["#REDIRECT George St Lo"]}, {"page": "George St. Loe", "response": ["#REDIRECT George St Lo"]}, {"page": "St. Lo (disambiguation)", "response": ["*George St Lo"]}]}}
