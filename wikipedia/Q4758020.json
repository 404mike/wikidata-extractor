Millar sued, and went to the Court of King's Bench to obtain an injunction and advocate perpetual copyright at common law. The jury found that the facts submitted by Millar were accurate, and asked the judges to clarify whether common law copyright existed. The first arguments were delivered on 30 June 1767, with John Dunning representing Millar and Edward Thurlow representing Taylor. A second set of arguments were submitted for Millar by William Blackstone on 7 June, and judgment was given on 20 April 1769. The final decision, written by Lord Mansfield and endorsed by Aston and Willes JJ, confirmed that there existed copyright at common law that turned \"upon Principles before and independent\" of the Statute of Anne, something justified because it was right \"that an Author should reap the pecuniary Profits of his own Ingenuity and Labour\". In other words, regardless of the Statute, there existed a perpetual copyright under the common law.
