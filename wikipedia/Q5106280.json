He co-presented the Tyne Tees television pop show All Right Now and spent several years as a disc jockey at Sunderland Mayfair (Mecca) in the late 1970s. He also produced the Channel 4 music show The White Room between 1995 and 1996 and worked on The Tube in Newcastle in the 1980s. He co-presented Check It Out 1979 to 1982 and was one of the interviewers of the notorious appearance of John Lydon (Johnny Rotten) when he walked off set, leaving Chris shaken.\nHe became one of the judges on the ITV1 reality show Soapstar Superstar in 2006 and reprised this role in 2007.\nHe is a supporter of Sunderland A.F.C.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Top of the Pops", "response": ["In 1997, incoming producer Chris Cowey phased out the use of celebrities and established a rotating team (similar to the 1991 revamp, although much more warmly received) of former presenters of youth music magazine The O-Zone Jayne Middlemiss and Jamie Theakston as well as Radio1 DJs Jo Whiley and Zoe Ball. The team was later augmented by Kate Thornton and Gail Porter.", "Chris Cowey in particular instigated a set of 'back to basics' changes when he took over the show. In 1998, a remixed version of the classic \"Whole Lotta Love\" theme tune previously used in the 1970s was introduced, accompanied by a new 1960s-inspired logo and title sequence. Cowey also began to export the brand overseas with localised versions of the show on air in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy by 2003. Finally, the programme returned to its previous home of BBC Television Centre in 2001, where it remained until its cancellation in 2006."]}, {"page": "Viva Forever", "response": ["\"Viva Forever\" was the group's last song performed on television as a quintet before Halliwell's departure. On 21 May 1998, the group recorded their performance for Top of the Pops, which was broadcast on 5 June 1998. The show's producer, Chris Cowey, said that they originally intended to air the performance for the single's release in July, but then pushed it given Halliwell's departure from the Spice Girls. \"Viva Forever\" was also the first song they performed on television without Halliwell, on 27 May 1998 at The National Lottery Live. On 13 May 1998, the group taped an appearance for the French television show Hit Machine, where they performed four songs, including \"Viva Forever\". The show aired later on 5 June 1998. The Spice Girls performed the song with Luciano Pavarotti in Modena, Italy, at the annually hosted Pavarotti & Friends charity concert on 9 June 1998. The performance was broadcast in various countries, and released on the compilation album and DVD entitled Pavarotti & Friends for the Children of Liberia (1998). On 13 July 1998, the Spice Girls performed the song in Toronto as part of their setlist for MuchMusics programme Intimate and Interactive. In August, while the group were on tour, a taped performance of the song aired on Top of the Pops via satellite from Chicago."]}, {"page": "Soapstar Superstar", "response": ["The first series was hosted by Fern Britton and Ben Shephard, with Jayne Middlemiss and Duncan James hosting a companion show for the series on ITV2, entitled Soapstar Superstar: Extra Tracks.

By this time, only Jo Whiley remained of the Radio 1 DJs introduced to the show by Blaxill, though Wells added Radio 1 Breakfast Show caretakers Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley to the roster (although both Whiley and Radcliffe & Riley only appeared twice each between Blaxill's exit and the arrival of his permanent successor in June). With a background in 'serious' music broadcasting having worked on Channel 4's The Tube and The White Room, the new executive producer was Chris Cowey who stripped the show of the gimmicks bequeathed by its predecessors, increased the number of studio performances per week whilst reducing the reliance on music videos, and gradually built a new team of regular presenters with backgrounds in music television and radio to replace the celebrity guests. Alongside Whiley, who graduated from occasional host to lead presenter in June 1997, came Jayne Middlemiss and Zoe Ball. Middlemiss had presented music strand The O-Zone for Children's BBC since 1995, whilst Ball was given a full-time role after guest presenting in March 1997, and ahead of her posting as the host of Radio 1's coveted breakfast show in October. Fellow Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs and Never Mind the Buzzcocks host Mark Lamarr were added to the team but were quickly dropped, though Jamie Theakston, co-host with Middlemiss on The O-Zone, and Ball on Live & Kicking arrived in January 1998 after guest presenting the previous October. All would continue to present The O-Zone and Live & Kicking concurrently with TOTP. Ball and Whiley departed in summer 1998 to be replaced by former Smash Hits editor Kate Thornton who established herself with Middlemiss and Theakston as lead presenters by autumn 1998. A revamp in May 1998 which included a change of title sequence, logo and theme music also saw a shift in focus from the Top 40 to the Top 20, with the chart rundown, now voiced every week by Radio 1 Chart Show host and former TOTP presenter Mark Goodier, extended from the Top 10 to Top 20. Children's TV presenter and model Gail Porter and Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills augmented the line-up from March 1999, and though Mills left in August, Porter continued with Middlemiss and Theakston as lead presenters into the new millennium."]}, {"page": "Pixie Lott discography", "response": ["| Chris Cowey"]}, {"page": "Ken Bolam", "response": ["He was instrumental in the setting up of Initial Kids and the production of Miami 7  (BBC), Cleopatra's Comin' Atcha, and Wild Track for ITV.
