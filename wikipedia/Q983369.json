He is famous as a private tutor of aspiring undergraduate Cambridge mathematicians, earning him the sobriquet the \"senior-wrangler maker.\"\nHe also made important contributions in asserting a solid, rather than fluid, interior for the Earth and explaining many geological phenomena in terms of his model. However, though his conclusions proved to be correct, his mathematical and physical reasoning were subsequently seen as unsound.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Green (mathematician)", "response": ["Green's work was not well known in the mathematical community during his lifetime. Besides Green himself, the first mathematician to quote his 1828 work was the Briton Robert Murphy (1806\u20131843) in his 1833 work. Green is mentioned in a footnote on p. 357. In 1845, four years after Green's death, Green's work was rediscovered by the young William Thomson (then aged 21), later known as Lord Kelvin, who popularised it for future mathematicians. According to the book \"George Green\" by D.M. Cannell, William Thomson noticed Murphy's citation of Green's 1828 essay but found it difficult to locate Green's 1828 work; he finally got some copies of Green's 1828 work from William Hopkins in 1845."]}, {"page": "John Tyndall", "response": ["Work on glaciers alerted Tyndall to the research of de Saussure into the heating effect of sunlight, and the concept of Fourier, developed by Pouillet and William Hopkins; that heat from the sun penetrates the atmosphere more easily than \"obscure heat\" (infrared)  \"terrestrial radiation\" from the warmed Earth, causing what we now call the greenhouse effect. In the spring of 1859, Tyndall began research into how thermal radiation, both visible and obscure, affects different gases and aerosols. He developed differential absorption spectroscopy using the electro-magnetic thermopile devised by Melloni. Tyndall began intensive experiments on 9 May 1859, at first without significant results, "]}, {"page": "1850 in science", "response": ["* Wollaston Medal: William Hopkins"]}, {"page": "Arthur Cayley", "response": ["Cayley's tutor at Cambridge was George Peacock and his private coach was William Hopkins.

According to his view, all mountain ranges parallel to the same great circle of the earth are of strictly contemporaneous origin, and between the great circles a relation of symmetry exists in the form of a pentagonal r\u00e9seau. An elaborate statement and criticism of the theory was given in his anniversary address to the Geological Society of London in 1853 by William Hopkins. The theory did not find general acceptance, but it proved of great value to geological science, owing to the extensive additions to the knowledge of the structure of mountain ranges which its author made in endeavouring to find facts to support it."]}, {"page": "John Pratt (Archdeacon of Calcutta)", "response": ["Pratt was the second son of Josiah Pratt and Elizabeth n\u00e9e Jowett. His exact date of birth is debated and it is thought that he was born in London as he was baptised on 30 June 1809 at St Mary Woolnoth. His early schooling was at Oakham School under the tutelage of Dr Doncaster. He then went to Caius College, Cambridge and was a student of William Hopkins. He graduated B.A., third wrangler (after Alexander Ellice and Joseph Bowstead) in the Mathematical Tripos 1833, was elected to a fellowship, and proceeded M.A. in 1836. For a while he stayed at Cambridge and gave private tuitions. One of his students was Harvey Goodwin, later Bishop of Carlisle. While at Cambridge he wrote a book called Mathematical Principles of Mechanical Philosophy (1836, second edition 1845) which described mathematical applications in gravitational physics.", "Even as he travelled to India in 1838 aboard the Duke of Buccleuch he conducted experiments to examine currents in the ocean and measured temperatures at various depths. While in India, Pratt was approached by Andrew Scott Waugh, Surveyor General of India who had succeeded George Everest, to examine the gravitational anomaly caused by the Himalayas on the plumbline which resulted in errors in the Great Trigonometrical Survey. Pratt estimated the deviation of the plumbline that would be expected by the mass of the mountains (based on density estimated in 1772 at Mount Schiehallion in Scotland) but the observed deviations were much less. He propounded a theory that the density of the mountains was less than that of the underlying substrate. It was also noticed that the deviations of the plumbline were greater at the foot of the mountain and reduced as one moved away from the mountain. George Airy came up with the explanation that the roots of the mountain go deep into the earth. He compared it with a heap of logs in water and suggested that when a log juts higher above the water, a greater amount of it must be submerged. Pratt on the other hand suggested that there was a lower density under mountains below sea-level (actually refined later and termed the depth of compensation) and that this is offset by the mass above sea-level. Pratt's explanation assumes a variation in density whereas Airy assumes a constant crustal density. Pratt found fault with Airy's idea as it assumed a thinner crust (10 miles) than that estimated by William Hopkins (800 to 1000 miles) and also that the crust is lighter. Pratt said that the crust cools from the solid interior and should therefore be denser. Airy did not defend his view but Samuel Haughton used the debate to claim that mathematics was a useless tool for speculation. Pratt suggested that the crust would be depressed in the cooler parts of the world and suggested that the plumb deflection was caused by anomalous high density in the oceans south of the Himalayas. Pratt also applied his knowledge of physics and mathematics to a number of applications in India on which he was consulted by engineers. He examined arches, the physics involved in the sudden movement of a mass of water such as in the Indus floods of 1858 and in the bore of the Hooghly river, and computed the iron required for cantilever bridges."]}, {"page": "Edward Routh", "response": ["Routh obtained his BA (1849) and MA (1853) in London. He attended Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he was taught by Isaac Todhunter and coached by \"senior wrangler maker\" William Hopkins. While at Peterhouse, Routh rowed for Peterhouse Boat Club. In 1854, Routh graduated just above James Clerk Maxwell, as Senior Wrangler, sharing the Smith's prize with him. Routh was elected fellow of Peterhouse in 1856."]}]}}
