He is famous as a private tutor of aspiring undergraduate Cambridge mathematicians, earning him the sobriquet the \"senior-wrangler maker.\"\nHe also made important contributions in asserting a solid, rather than fluid, interior for the Earth and explaining many geological phenomena in terms of his model. However, though his conclusions proved to be correct, his mathematical and physical reasoning were subsequently seen as unsound.", "link_mentions": {}}}
