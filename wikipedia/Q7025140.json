In a long career, he was perhaps best known as the first actor to play the role of Othello in the Restoration era.A \"Nicholas Bert\" was christened on 27 May 1621, in Norwich; the record may refer to the actor, though this is not certain. According to James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), Burt began as a boy player with the King's Men, an apprentice of John Shank (died 1636). He was with the celebrated young company Beeston's Boys in the 1638\u201342 period. As a young actor filling female roles, Burt gained particular notice for playing Clariana in Shirley's Love's Cruelty.\nAfter the theatres closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War, Burt, like some other actors, joined the Royalist army supporting the cause of King Charles I. Like fellow actors Charles Hart and Robert Shatterell, Burt served as an officer in the regiment of Prince Rupert in the early and mid-1640s. He most likely saw combat in the battles of Marston Moor and Naseby, and perhaps at Edgehill as well.Once the Civil War had ended, Burt returned to acting and to the King's Men: he was one of the performers arrested on 5 February 1648, during an illegal performance of Rollo Duke of Normandy (he played Latorch). He was also one of the ten men who tried to restart the King's Men in December 1648, despite the parliamentarians' opposition to playacting.With the Restoration, Burt's professional fortunes revived.  Burt took the lead role in a 1660 production of Shakespeare's Othello, the first staging of that play after the theatres re-opened; Walter Clun won fame for his portrayal of Iago in that production. Samuel Pepys was in the audience on 11 October 1660, and saw Burt's Othello again in 1669, as recorded in his Diary. (After that time, though, Burt lost the role to Hart.)\nIn 1661 Burt became one of the thirteen actors who were original sharers in the newly organized King's Company under the management of Thomas Killigrew. He continued with the King's Company until 1678. When the troupe's theatre, the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, burned down in 1672, the funds to build its replacement had to be raised largely from the actors; Burt invested \u00a3160 in the project.Beyond Othello, Burt played a range of significant roles, in revivals of works by Shakespeare, Jonson and Fletcher:\n\nPrince Hal in Shakespeare's Henry IV plays\nCleremont in Jonson's Epicene\nCorvino in Volpone\nSurly in The Alchemist\nCicero in Catiline\nSeleucus in Fletcher's The Humorous Lieutenant\nDon John Decastrio in Rule a Wife and Have a Wife\nTygranes in A King and No King\nthe Elder Loveless in The Scornful Lady\nCharles in The Elder Brother\u2014 and contemporary works, by  John Dryden:\n\nPalamede in Marriage \u00e0 la mode\nPerez in Amboyna\nLysimantes in The Maiden Queen\nDon Lopez in An Evening's Love\nVasquez in The Indian Emperour\nCamillo in The Assignation\u2014 and by other dramatists:\n\nMaherbal in Lee's Sophonisba, or Hannibal's Overthrow\nAfterwit in Wilson's The Cheats\nCount Guesselin in Boyle's The Black Prince.The date of Burt's death is not known; he was alive at least until 1690.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Othello", "response": ["At the start of the Restoration era, on 11 October 1660, Samuel Pepys saw the play at the Cockpit Theatre.

Killigrew beat Davenant to a debut, at Gibbon's Tennis Court in Clare Market, with the new King's Company. Its original members were Michael Mohun, William Wintershall, Robert Shatterell, William Cartwright, Walter Clun, Charles Hart and Nicholas Burt. They played for a time at the old Red Bull Theatre, but in 1663 the company moved to the new Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. (Unfortunately, Killigrew gained a reputation as an incompetent manager; he was constantly in disputes with his actors and had to bribe his stars to keep working for him.) Killigrew staged plays by Aphra Behn, John Dryden, William Wycherley...and Thomas Killigrew, as well as revivals of Beaumont and Fletcher. Having inherited the rights and repertory of the old King's Men, the King's Company  performed many of Shakespeare's works, in the rewritten forms that were so popular at the time and so disparaged later. Two Killigrew productions of his own Parson's Wedding, in 1664 and 1672-3, were cast entirely with women."]}, {"page": "Marriage \u00e0 la mode (play)", "response": ["The King's Company first performed Marriage \u00e0 la Mode in London in 1673.

(Later, Shank would claim that he spent \u00a340 on Thompson, and \u00a3200 on his apprentices overall.) Shank is known to have played at least one female role himself in these years, the minor part of the servant Petella in the company's 1632 revival of Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase.
