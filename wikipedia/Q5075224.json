The Portuguese Division of Francisco Silveira's continued the line to the south, with Hip\u00f3lito da Costa's brigade watching the Berderis Pass and Archibald Campbell's brigade posted at the heights above Aldudes. Historian Charles Oman asserted that Stewart's defensive arrangements were \"ludicrously incomplete\". The French had a large force at Urdax only  distant but routine reconnaissance patrols were not sent out. Cameron's brigade with four guns from Da Cunha's Portuguese battery was well-positioned across the main road at the west end of the Maya saddle, but at the east end there was only an 80-man picket on the Aretesque knoll. Pringle's brigade was camped  to the south in the village of Maya while the brigade's four light companies camped closer to the Maya Pass."]}, {"page": "Anglo-Portuguese Army", "response": ["* Col Charles Ashworth", "* Col Charles Ashworth"]}, {"page": "Sir Charles Ashworth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Ashworth"]}, {"page": "Battle of Fuentes de O\u00f1oro order of battle", "response": ["\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Col Charles Ashworth"]}, {"page": "Ashworth (surname)", "response": ["*Charles Ashworth (died 1832), English major-general"]}, {"page": "Ashworth, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Ashworth"]}]}}
