In August, he gave a speech at a meeting of the Institute of Personnel Management and was asked a question about immigration. He answered that limiting immigration would require a change in the law: \"There might be circumstances in which such a change of the law might be the lesser of two evils\". But he added, \"There would be very few people who would say the time had yet come when it was essential that so great a change should be made\". Powell later told Paul Foot that the statement was made \"out of loyalty to the Government line\".

On what seems to have been the very same day [in March 1989], perhaps a few hours earlier, Thatcher's Secretary of State for Transport, Paul Channon, was the guest of five prominent political correspondents at a lunch at the Garrick Club. It was agreed that anything said at the lunch was 'on strict lobby terms' \u2013 that is, for the journalists only, not their readers. Channon then announced that the Dumfries and Galloway Police \u2013 the smallest police force in Britain \u2013 had concluded a brilliant criminal investigation into the Lockerbie crash. They had found who was responsible and arrests were expected before long. So sensational was the revelation that at least one of the five journalists broke ranks; and the news that the Lockerbie villains would soon be behind bars in Scotland was divulged to the public. Channon, still playing the lobby game, promptly denied that he was the source of the story. Denounced in a front page story in the Daily Mirror as a \"liar\", he did not sue or complain. A few months later he was quietly sacked. Thatcher, of course, could not blame her loyal minister for his indiscretion, which coincided so unluckily with her instructions from the White House."]}, {"page": "Donald Crowhurst", "response": ["* Donald Crowhurst \u2013 Sponsored for Heroism (1970) a BBC TV film written and narrated by Paul Foot and directed by Colin Thomas"]}, {"page": "Bridgewater Four", "response": ["The campaign to free and absolve the four men was led by Michael Hickey's mother, Ann Whelan, and campaigning journalist Paul Foot.
