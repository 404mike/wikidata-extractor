The film portrays the brutality of life inside a British borstal. The script was originally filmed as a television play for the BBC's Play for Today series in 1977. However, due to the violence depicted, it was withdrawn from broadcast. Two years later, director Alan Clarke and scriptwriter Roy Minton remade it as a film, first shown on Channel 4 in 1983. By this time the borstal system had been reformed. The original TV version was eventually allowed to be aired eight years later in 1991.", "The film differs from the original BBC production in many respects. The film contains strong language and is much more violent and graphic than the milder BBC version. Ray Winstone, John Blundell, Phil Daniels, John Judd, Ray Burdis and Patrick Murray all reprise their respective roles as Carlin, Banks, Richards, Sands, Eckersley and Dougan from the BBC version, while all other roles are recast. David Threlfall had been intended to reprise his role as Archer from the BBC version, but he was working with the Royal Shakespeare Company at the time and was subsequently replaced by Mick Ford. The story was also changed. The BBC version features a homosexual relationship between Carlin and another inmate, which was dropped from the film. Minton later said that this was a pity as it would have expanded Carlin's character and made him vulnerable in an area where he could not afford to be vulnerable."]}, {"page": "How to Get Ahead in Advertising", "response": ["* Mick Ford as Richard"]}, {"page": "Ashley Pharoah", "response": ["|Television Drama Series (with Matthew Graham, Mark Greig, Julie Rutterford and Mick Ford)"]}, {"page": "Matthew Graham", "response": ["|Television Drama Series (with Ashley Pharoah, Mark Greig, Julie Rutterford and Mick Ford)"]}, {"page": "Story Teller (magazine)", "response": ["* Mike's Bike (Part 1): Mick Ford", "* David and Goliath: Mick Ford", "* Mike's Bike (Part 2): Mick Ford", "* The Swords of King Arthur : Mick Ford", "* Goblin Market : Mick Ford", "* The Treachery of Morgan : Mick Ford", "* Arthur Gives Back His Sword : Mick Ford"]}, {"page": "Fish (British TV series)", "response": ["Fish is a British television drama series first broadcast on BBC One in 2000.
