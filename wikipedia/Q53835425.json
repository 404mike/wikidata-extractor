Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 page 222 In May 1945, the Trieste crisis almost caused an Anglo-Yugoslav war as Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia laid claim to the Italian city of Trieste while Britain supported retaining Trieste within Italy. As Yugoslavia was a Soviet ally in 1945, there were very real fears at the time that an Anglo-Yugoslav war could easily escalate into an Anglo-Soviet war. Knight argued that the forced repatriations in Austria undertaken in May 1945 were at least in part an effort to calm down a very tense situation. Knight maintained that the British wanted to clear Austria of all the vast number of prisoners they had taken to free up soldiers now struck guarding the prisoners for a possible war with Yugoslavia and to improve relations by returning peoples who were the enemies of the Yugoslav and Soviet governments. Both the Yugoslav and Soviet governments believed the British were intending to use Axis collaborationist forces such as the Cossack corps against them. To help resolve the raging controversy, Brigadier Anthony Cowgill formed a committee consisting of himself; a former diplomat and \"Russia hand\" Lord Brimelow, and Christopher Booker, a journalist well known for his conservative views.Thorpe, D.R. Supermac The Life of Harold Macmillan, New York: Random House, 2010 page 221-221 Cowgill believed that the honour of the British Army had been smeared, but Booker was a supporter of Tolstoy when he joined the committee in 1986.Thorpe, D.R.

Tolstoy at first co-operated with the inquiry, sharing documents and contact details for surviving witnesses. Cowgill concluded, as outlined in an initial report in September 1988 and a final report in October 1990, that the repatriations were in line with UK policy. He said there had been no conspiracy and Macmillan's role was minimal."]}, {"page": "Cowgill, Anthony", "response": ["#redirectAnthony Cowgill"]}]}}
