Leo Bryant left to pursue other interests but remained part of the set up and occasionally performed with the band. Lemez Lovas left the band to pursue other interests and projects such as Shtetl Superstars and Yiddish Twist Orchestra. With bookings flooding in, the band embarked on a solid touring programme for two whole years across Europe. Singer Bridget Amofah (currently of Rudimental) joined the band, as well as Lucy Shaw on Bass, Anna Phoebe on Violin and David Orchant on Trumpet.  During the middle of this schedule the band played Glastonbury's Avalon Stage in 2007. Over the next two years the band developed a strong performing presence and it was in this period of the burgeoning East European and Balkan music scene that Oi Va Voi found a huge popularity across the Eastern Europe and with that Turkey opened up to them. The Turkish audience found a deep connection in the band's sound with its mix of Eastern European, Balkan, Jewish and Middle Eastern modes and rhythms fused with metropolitan urban dance music and solid songwriting all contributed to them having week long residencies at Istanbul's Babylon Club, regional radio airplay, extensive regional touring and festival headline appearances sometimes touring twice within the same year. Whilst on the road, the band started writing new material and on returning to the UK, the band's relationship with V2 UK records changed as the label was cutting back on its roster of artists due to mergers and global restructuring. The band finished the two years of touring and began recording their next album with producers Bacon and Quarmby.", "In 2017 OI VA VOI recorded Memory Drop, their 5th studio album.
