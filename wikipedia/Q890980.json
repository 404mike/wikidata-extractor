In music, it has been evoked to indicate support for American policies, as in Toby Keith's song \"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)\", and in opposition, appearing on the cover of the Dead Kennedys' album Bedtime for Democracy, which protested the Reagan administration. In film, the torch is the setting for the climax of director Alfred Hitchcock's 1942 movie Saboteur. The statue makes one of its most famous cinematic appearances in the 1968 picture Planet of the Apes, in which it is seen half-buried in sand. It is knocked over in the science-fiction film Independence Day\u00a0 and in Cloverfield the head is ripped off. In Jack Finney's time-travel novel Time and Again, the right arm of the statue, on display in the early 1880s in Madison Square Park, plays a crucial role.

Before the mid-20th century, this was most often done by hiding fantastic worlds within unknown, distant locations on Earth; peasants who seldom, if ever, traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an ogre or other fantastical beings could live an hour away. Characters in the author's world could board a ship and find themselves on a fantastic island, as Jonathan Swift does in Gulliver's Travels or in the 1949 novel Silverlock by John Myers Myers, or be sucked up into a tornado and land in Oz. These \"lost world\" stories can be seen as geographic equivalents of a \"parallel universe\", as the worlds portrayed are separate from our own, and hidden to everyone except those who take the difficult journey there. The geographic \"lost world\" can blur into a more explicit \"parallel universe\" when the fantasy realm overlaps a section of the \"real\" world, but is much larger inside than out, as in Robert Holdstock's novel Mythago Wood."]}, {"page": "List of science fiction novels", "response": ["* Ancient Echoes by Robert Holdstock", "* Mythago Wood series by Robert Holdstock", "* Where Time Winds Blow by Robert Holdstock"]}, {"page": "Elite (video game)", "response": ["Elite was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden-line removal.

Boorman took the initiative to promote the film himself by making VHS copies available for no charge to Academy members at several Los Angeles-area video rental stores. Boorman's idea later became ubiquitous during Hollywood's award season, and by the 2010s, more than a million Oscar screeners were mailed to Academy members each year.
