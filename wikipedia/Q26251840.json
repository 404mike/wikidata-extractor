Under Lowe's management, Sawyer played predominantly as the left-sided centre half in a back three.

During his time suspended, he served in a coaching capacity for Argyle's U-23 side for a Premier League Cup game against Everton. In just his third game back from suspension he was sent off again, this time in the 40th minute of a 2\u20131 defeat away to Bradford City, for a similarly mistimed challenge on Dylan Connolly.

A home tie with Yeovil Town awaited in the second round, and for the first time since 20 January 1982 Staffordshire Police granted the club permission to play a home tie at the same date and time as Stoke City. Despite a poor first half Vale seemed to have the game won thanks to a Tom Pope header, but the team switched off defensively to allow substitute Jordan Green to score a last-minute equaliser and take the game to a replay. The game at Huish Park proved eventful, as red cards for Monta\u00f1o and Gibbons did not prevent the Vale from twice equalising the match before eventually losing 3\u20132 after extra-time; Harness had scored his first goal for the club to take the game into extra-time in style with a long-range shot, but his effort was upstaged by Kay, who scored the \"goal of his life\" with a stunning long-range lob. Aspin was highly critical of referee Gavin Ward, particularly for his decision to both issue a penalty and send off Monta\u00f1o for a \"soft\" challenge."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Yeovil Town F.C. season", "response": ["Yeovil then faced Accrington Stanley in their first home match of the season, a brace from Southampton loanee Olufela Olomola and a second goal of the season from Zoko saw Yeovil recover from falling behind to record a 3\u20132 victory.

Yeovil then traveled to newly promoted Forest Green Rovers, early goals from Olomola and an Otis Khan penalty saw Yeovil take a 2\u20130 lead, after Forest Green pulled one back Zoko scored to give Yeovil a 3\u20131 lead but the Glovers collapsed in the second half to lose the match 4\u20133.", "On 1 December, Yeovil confirmed the signing of midfielder Oscar Gobern on non-contract terms until the end of the season. Yeovil began December with a FA Cup second round tie against fellow League Two side Port Vale, the game ended 1\u20131 after a late header from substitute Jordan Green earned Yeovil a replay. The Glovers then faced League One side AFC Wimbledon in the second round of the EFL Trophy, first goals for the club from Keston Davies and Jake Gray secured Yeovil a comfortable 2\u20130 victory and progression into the third round. On 8 December, youth team defender Jeremiah Gyebi joined National League South side Poole Town on an initial month's loan deal. Yeovil's first league match of the month saw them succumb to a third home defeat of the season losing 2\u20130 to Lincoln City. On 12 December, Yeovil hosted Port Vale in their FA Cup second round replay, the two sides finished regular time with another 1\u20131 draw, with Otis Khan scoring a penalty in the first half, before a late equaliser for Port Vale, who had two men sent off. Khan scored a second in extra time, but after Port Vale equalised again, Fran\u00e7ois Zoko scored the game's winner a minute later to send Yeovil through to the third round.", "Yeovil then traveled to Mansfield Town and held their play-off chasing opponents to a goalless draw to record their first away clean sheet since February 2017, but the result saw them slip to 21st in the table only one point outside the relegation zone. On 23 December, Yeovil beat third place side Exeter City 3\u20131 with goals from Jake Gray, Fran\u00e7ois Zoko and a Sam Surridge penalty. Boxing Day saw the Glovers travel to Cheltenham Town and record a second consecutive victory, second-half goals from Omar Sowunmi and Jordan Green earned Yeovil a 2\u20130 victory. Yeovil ended 2017 with a trip to Morecambe, the Glovers took the lead after just 25-seconds with Jake Gray scoring his third goal of December, Otis Khan's tenth goal of the season doubled Yeovil's lead, but a late collapse saw Yeovil lose the match 4\u20133, despite Omar Sowunmi giving Yeovil a 3\u20132 lead with just six minutes to go. Khan's goal against Morecambe was later awarded the League Two goal of the month award.", "Yeovil started the new year with a home fixture against Crawley Town, despite taking the lead through Sam Surridge the Glovers lost the match 2\u20131 having been reduced to nine men with both Connor Smith and Omar Sowunmi being sent off. The first week of the January transfer window saw a high turnover of players with the loans of Sid Nelson, Olufela Olomola and Matt Worthington expiring while the loan of Keston Davies was terminated after he had failed to break into the Yeovil side. The four loans were replaced with Liverpool defender Corey Whelan, Barnsley midfielder Jared Bird, Middlesbrough attacking midfielder Lewis Wing and Southampton striker Marcus Barnes all joining the club on loan until the end of the season from their respective clubs. On 6 January, Yeovil faced League One side Bradford City in the third round of the FA Cup. Despite being the lowest ranked team left in the competition, Yeovil won the match 2\u20130 with a goal from Marcus Barnes on his debut and a third of the season from Jordan Green enough to see Yeovil through to the fourth round for only the fourth time in their history. Yeovil then faced Forest Green Rovers in the third round of the EFL Trophy, and secured back-to-back 2\u20130 wins with goals from Nathan and Connor Smith enough to secure qualification to the quarter-finals of the competition. Having established himself in the Yeovil team, attacker Jordan Green was rewarded with a new contract until the summer of 2019, while defender Tom James also signed an improved contract. On 13 January, Yeovil drew 1\u20131 away at relegation rivals Port Vale, with Fran\u00e7ois Zoko scoring his tenth goal of the season to give the Glovers the lead but they conceded in the final five minutes to drop two points. The following week saw the club confirm that they had received a \"substantial bid\" for winger Otis Khan which had met a release clause in his contract, and that there had also been interest in defender Omar Sowunmi. On 20 January, Yeovil faced Chesterfield in a relegation six-pointer, after falling behind against the run of play Lewis Wing equalised with a 25-yard looping shot, his first goal for the club. In the final minute of injury time after Otis Khan appeared to have his shirt pulled he stopped playing allowing Chestefield to go up the other end to score a late winner with Khan then being sent off for shoving referee Kevin Johnson. Yeovil appealed the decision to send the midfielder off, but the appeal was deemed frivolous and Khan's ban was subsequently extended to five matches."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 AFC Bournemouth season", "response": ["| 16 August 2017 || RW ||  || Jordan Green || Yeovil Town || Free || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["|15||Jordan Green||RW/CF||||New Cross||||10||1||Yeovil Town||18 January 2018||Undisclosed||2021", "|15||||LW||Jordan Green                                      ||1||0||0||0||1", "|15||||LW||Jordan Green                                      ||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||0", "| 18 January 2019 || RW ||  || Jordan Green || Yeovil Town || Undisclosed || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Yeovil Town F.C. season", "response": ["Yeovil started their League Two season with an away trip to relegated Bury, on 4 August.

On 11 August, Yeovil faced Mansfield Town in their first home match of the season. Yeovil took the lead twice through Diallang Jaiyesimi and Yoann Arquin's first goals for the club but the Glovers were twice pegged back to draw 2\u20132 with all four goals scored in the first 26 minutes. Yeovil then faced Championship side Aston Villa in the EFL Cup first round, Yeovil thought they had taken the lead just before half-time when Jaiyesimi poked in at the back post but it was disallowed for a \"foul\" in the build-up and saw striker Alex Fisher have his penalty saved by Villa goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Moreira. Villa's Conor Hourihane knocked Yeovil out with a late winner. The match also saw the Glovers give a debut to youth player Gabriel Rogers who became the first player born in the 2000s to play for the Yeovil senior team. On 17 August, Yeovil secured their first win of the season with a 4\u20130 victory away at Notts County, courtesy of a hat-trick from Alex Fisher and a fourth from former Notts County player Yoann Arquin.
