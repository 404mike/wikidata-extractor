He studied the permeability of a range of biological materials to around 500 chemical compounds.\nIn 1900, Overton proposed a biomembrane model \"Overton Biomembrane Model\" which stated that biomembranes are made up of lipids. He gave this statement on the basis of observation of transport of lipid soluble substances across the biomembranes.\nHe came to Lund University in Sweden as a professor, and married Louise Petr\u00e9n-Overton, the first woman in Sweden with a doctorate in mathematics; they had four children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cell membrane", "response": ["The structure has been variously referred to by different writers as the ectoplast (de Vries, 1885), Plasmahaut (plasma skin, Pfeffer, 1877, 1891),Pfeffer, W. 1877.

They further proposed the use of the partition coefficient in an olive oil/water mixture as an estimate of this lipophilic associated toxicity. Corwin Hansch later proposed the use of n-octanol as an inexpensive synthetic alcohol that could be obtained in a pure form as an alternative to olive oil."]}]}}
