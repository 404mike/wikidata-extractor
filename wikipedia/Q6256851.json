In 1797 Simcoe managed to get a grist mill established on the Humber River.  It was owned and operated by John Lawrence. Over the years, numerous mills have been operated along the river by such men as William Cooper, W. P. Howland, Thomas Fisher, John Scarlett, William Gamble and Joseph Rowntree.

John Scarlett was the first land owner and employer in the area and built his home \"Runnymede\" in 1838, near where Dundas Street West and St. John's Road meet today.  By 1817 he had acquired most of property that is now the Junction and much more to the north and west to the Humber River.  From 1857 to 1876 the Carlton Race Course dominated the southeast of the neighbourhood. The race track was owned by the Keele family (William Conway Keele and his son Charles Keele).  The track was the site of the first Queen's Plate. Following the arrival of the railways in the 1880s, the old racetrack and surrounding area was developed by Daniel Webster Clendenan, who would be elected the first reeve of the village of West Toronto Junction, and first mayor of the town of Junction in 1889. The approximate locations of the two main straightaways of the track are now High Park Avenue and Pacific Avenue (between Glenlake Road and Annette Street)."]}, {"page": "Runnymede Collegiate Institute", "response": ["The school was built on land, which had belonged to John Scarlett.
