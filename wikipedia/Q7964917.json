He played as a defender for Queen's Park, Clyde, New Brighton and Grimsby Town. He then managed Accrington Stanley, Bradford Park Avenue, New Brighton, Tranmere Rovers, Hibernian, Stockport County and Berwick Rangers.Like most players of his generation, Galbraith's league career was delayed by the Second World War, which meant that league football in both England and Scotland was not held from 1939 until the start of the 1946\u201347 season. Galbraith played for Clyde for two seasons before moving to Merseyside club New Brighton, for which he made over 100 league appearances in three seasons. He then moved to Grimsby Town, where he stayed for two seasons.\nGalbraith was then appointed as player-manager of Accrington Stanley in 1953, making 21 league appearances in the 1953\u20131954 season before ending his playing career. As manager, Galbraith took Accrington to their highest ever finishing position in the Football League, as they narrowly missed out on promotion to Division Two. He once selected a team of eleven Scots for Accrington in a Football League match, and fans joked that players wouldn't be selected unless they were Scottish. Galbraith resigned in August 1958 after the club's directors advised him that they would be cutting his budget for players.Galbraith had stints as manager of Bradford Park Avenue and New Brighton. This was followed by a short, unsuccessful stint as Tranmere Rovers manager in 1961. The club was relegated to Division Four and were eliminated from the FA Cup by non-league opposition. Galbraith left Tranmere near the end of the year, when Hibs were seeking to replace Hugh Shaw, who had resigned in November. Bobby Brown and Jock Stein were the preferred choices of the Hibs board, but Brown did not want the job and Dunfermline refused to allow Stein to move. Galbraith was the next choice for Hibs, who had signed Gerry Baker from Manchester City while the club did not have a manager.Hibs just avoided relegation in both seasons that Galbraith managed the club, but he introduced Pat Stanton into the team and signed players such as Neil Martin, Pat Quinn, John Parke and Willie Hamilton. Galbraith resigned from his position after the club had secured their Division One status near the end of the 1963\u201364 season, without acrimony or lining up another club. Galbraith was unsuccessful as Hibs manager, but the relative success of his successors (Jock Stein and Bob Shankly) was due to the players mentioned above. In fact, Stein only signed one player (John McNamee) before the start of the 1964\u201365 season, as he was able to make a good team out of the good players Galbraith had introduced.After leaving Hibs, Galbraith had brief spells in charge of Stockport County and Berwick Rangers. He died in 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Berwick Rangers F.C.", "response": ["* Walter Galbraith (Oct 1975\u00a0\u2013 Dec 1975)"]}, {"page": "Jock Stein", "response": ["In the 1961\u201362 season, Dunfermline progressed to the quarter-final of the 1961\u201362 European Cup Winners' Cup and finished in fourth place in the league. Their league position earned a place in the Fairs Cup after a Greek club withdrew. Dunfermline defeated Everton in the 1962\u201363 Fairs Cup and retrieved a four-goal deficit against Valencia, but then lost in a play-off game. Towards the end of the 1963\u201364 season, it became apparent that Hibs wanted to replace their manager, Walter Galbraith. It was reported in the media on 27 February that Stein would leave Dunfermline at the end of the season. A fortnight later, amidst speculation that Stein would move to Hibernian, Galbraith left the Edinburgh club. On 28 March, Dunfermline lost in a Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers. It was announced two days later that Stein would leave Dunfermline with immediate effect, allowing him to take charge at Hibernian."]}, {"page": "Calvary Cemetery (Seattle)", "response": ["*Walter Galbraith, former president of Galbraith and Co. and director of Washington Mutual"]}, {"page": "Galbraith", "response": ["* Walter Galbraith (1918\u20131995), Scottish football player and manager"]}, {"page": "John King (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["King started his career at Everton in 1957. He made 48 First Division appearances at Goodison Park under Ian Buchan and Johnny Carey over the course of the 1957\u201358, 1958\u201359, and 1959\u201360 campaigns. He then moved on to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, playing 21 Third Division games under Don Welsh, before he joined Tranmere Rovers and being signed by Walter Galbraith. Rovers were relegated out of the Third Division in 1960\u201361. New manager Dave Russell led them to a 15th-place finish in the Fourth Division in 1961\u201362. They then reached eighth in 1962\u201363 and seventh in 1963\u201364, before finishing fifth in 1964\u201365, just one place and one point behind promoted Oxford United. They came even closer in 1965\u201366, finishing behind promoted Colchester United on goal average. Rovers finally achieved their goal in 1966\u201367, winning promotion in fourth place, they finished four points ahead of fifth place Crewe Alexandra. They then retained their third tier status in 1967\u201368, finishing two places above the relegation zone. Over eight years at Prenton Park, King made 264 appearances in all competitions."]}]}}
