James' (aka Aphex Twin)'s housemate. He had been making electronic music using SoundEdit 16 while supporting himself with various programming jobs. After moving into a shared house with James, Tom Jenkinson, Chris Jeffs and Grant Wilson-Claridge, he released his first album Goon on Rephlex in 1996. Rumors that Goon actually was an alias for Aphex Twin persisted even after the release of Cradle of History two years later. After releasing Vatican Nitez four years later, he left the Rephlex label and started his own label J-HOK records, which he released three albums on. He also released one album on Audio Dregs, and two albums and one EP on W\u00e9M\u00e8.Global Goon has also been rumored to have released five acid records under the alias Syntheme on both Planet Mu and W\u00e9M\u00e8 between 2007 and 2009, but this remains unconfirmed and Syntheme is also known as Louise Helena Wood, from Brighton, England.Music critics have characterized Global Goon's style as ambient music and \"easy listening fusion\". From Bessemer Cocktail and after, his music took a turn towards acid house rather than the easy listening downtempo.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rephlex Records", "response": ["*Global Goon"]}, {"page": "List of ambient music artists", "response": ["* Global Goon"]}, {"page": "26 Mixes for Cash", "response": ["Despite becoming a sought-after remixer during the 1990s, James admitted to not actually using the original source material in the case of some of his \"remixes\" for artists he disliked (such as Nine Inch Nails), explaining:  \"I never heard the originals...I don't want to, either.\"Allmusic review In some cases, he submitted his own original work, or the work of his flatmate Global Goon in place of his own work.Allmusic review"]}, {"page": "Cradle of History", "response": ["Cradle of History is an IDM/techno album by Johnny Hawk (Johnathon Taylor) under the recording name of Global Goon.
