Just before the end of the first half, Jack Aitchinson scored with a right-footed shot from just inside the box to square the tie. With just over 10 minutes to go, Mitchel Weiss takes advantage of a Kane Wilson slip to square it to Shaun Jeffers who tapped it home into an open net. Then, with 2 minutes left to play, the ball squeezed through a St Albans player to send Matty Stevens through on goal but with a heroic tackle from Dave Diedhiou and a point-blank stop from goalkeeper Michael Johnson, the Saints kept their 3-2 advantage.
