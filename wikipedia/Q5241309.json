He also created the Carol Day cartoon strip for the Daily Mail in 1956, creating a soap opera style of comic strip that paralleled similar work in the USA.\nHowever, it is his series of 169 illustrations for The Sketch magazine (from 1941 to 1951) that became most popular. In the 1950s he continued drawing in a similar style for Men Only.\nWright started work at his uncle's studio after leaving school, later becoming the fashion illustrator for a number of women's magazines. He was commissioned in 1941 to draw a series of glamorous women for The Sketch, most of whom were modelled on his wife Esme. The illustrations established him as one of the most popular pin-up artists during World War II. During the war he worked as a driving instructor for the armed forces in Abersoch, Wales, which left him plenty of time to continue his illustration work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Bolland", "response": ["As early as 1962, aged 11, Bolland remembers thinking that \"Carmine Infantino's work on the Flash and Gil Kane's on Green Lantern and the Atom had a sophistication about it that I hadn't [previously] seen.\" He would later cite Kane and Alex Toth as \"pinnacle[s] of excellence,\" alongside \"Curt Swan, Murphy Anderson, Sid Greene, Joe Kubert, Ross Andru, Mike Esposito, Nick Cardy and the under-rated Bruno Premiani,\" whose influences showed in his \"early crude stabs at drawing comics.\" The young Bolland did not rate Marvel Comics as highly as DC, feeling the covers cluttered and the paper quality crude.
