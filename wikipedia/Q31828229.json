In naming Charlie Allen to the final 25 man squad for this match, the Blues set a new record for the youngest UK player named to a final squad for a match in the Champions League. The Norwegian champions had eliminated the Blues from the competition back in the 2010\u201311 season, and again they proved to be too strong. A 6\u20130 aggregate defeat saw the Blues drop down into the UEFA Europa League second qualifying round Champions Path, where they faced Faroese champions HB T\u00f3rshavn \u2013 the fifth occasion since 2012 that they had faced Faroese opposition in Europe. A 3\u20132 win on aggregate secured a place in the third qualifying round of the Europa League for the first time, and indeed the third stage of any European competition since a 5\u20132 aggregate win over V\u00e5lerenga in November 1966. More history was made in the next round when the Blues faced Montenegro champions Sutjeska. A 2\u20131 win in the away leg was followed up with a 3\u20132 win in the second leg at Windsor Park, with the Blues winning 5\u20133 on aggregate to become the first Irish League side to reach the play-off round of the Europa League. It was only the second time that the club had won both legs of a European tie \u2013 the first being in 2013 against \u00cdF. Additionally, it was only the second time that the club had ever progressed through back-to-back rounds in Europe, again the first time since November 1966. In the play-off round, the Blues were drawn to face Azerbaijan champions Qaraba\u011f, with the winners qualifying for the Europa League group stage."]}, {"page": "Leeds United F.C.
