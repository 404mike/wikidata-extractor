He specialises in Shakespeare and Renaissance literature.Palfrey was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, grew up in Australia and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. He is known for his approach to Shakespeare's work, in which he discusses the dynamism of the playwright's language, its psychological effects and the actorly and bodily decisions generated by word-use.\nHis book Doing Shakespeare has been called \"an original and long-overdue resource for theatre scholar-artists.\"  It was listed as an \"International Book of the Year\" in 2004 by the Times Literary Supplement.  In the TLS, Jonathan Bate said that although the work was \"sometimes wayward,\" the book was 'always provocative of serious thought'. Bate could think 'of no critic since Empson who has teased out so much so lucidly and (usually) so persuasively from the intricacies of Shakespearean language.\" Palfrey's earlier book, Late Shakespeare: A New World of Worlds was described by Ann Jennalie Cook as 'among the most significant books of the year', 'a sweeping vision of these plays' language...indispensable for its subject', and as \"a valuable contribution to the political reading of Renaissance literary forms\" which challenged the traditional reading of Shakespeare's four romances. Russ McDonald writing in Shakespeare Quarterly described Late Shakespeare as \"original, quirky, occasionally brilliant, and almost always demanding.\"Palfrey's 2007 collaboration with theatre historian Tiffany Stern, Shakespeare in Parts, was awarded the 2009 Medieval and Renaissance Drama Society's David Bevington Prize for best new book. Palfrey's latest work is a collaborative novel written with fellow Shakespeare scholar Ewan Fernie.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Simon palfrey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Simon Palfrey "]}, {"page": "List of Brasenose College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Simon Palfrey, English scholar at Oxford University "]}, {"page": "Palfrey (surname)", "response": ["*Simon Palfrey, English Scholar at Oxford University and a Fellow in English at Brasenose College, Oxford University"]}, {"page": "Ewan Fernie", "response": ["Fernie's critical work is characterised by passionate intellectual engagement and the belief that art and literature can really connect with and even shape personal, political and religious life.
