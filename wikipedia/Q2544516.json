Some Mahayana sutras such as the \u2018Sutra on Changing the Female Sex\u2019 and the \u2018Questions of the Daughter Pure Faith\u2019 also echo this idea. For various historical and cultural reasons such as wars and invasions, the orders of ordained Buddhist nuns disappeared or was never introduced in Southeast Asia and Tibet, though they slowly started being reintroduced by nuns such as Ayya Khema, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, Tenzin Palmo and Thubten Chodron. Until very recently, China, Taiwan and Korea were the only places where fully ordained bhiksuni lineages still existed. An international conference of Buddhist nuns was held on February 1987 at Bodh Gaya and saw the formation of 'Sakyadhita' (Daughters of the Buddha) the International Association of Buddhist Women which focuses on helping Buddhist nuns throughout the world.Peter Harvey An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics Cambridge University Press 2000, page 400."]}, {"page": "International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha", "response": ["Bhikshuni and Yogini Tenzin Palmo -a member of the Committee of Western Bhikshunis-  belonging to Drukpa Lineage of the Kagyu school in her statement A brief overview of the situation for nuns in the Tibetan Tradition elaborated that  in spite of full Bhikshuni ordination monks had not to be afraid because according to vinaya they were going to keep their higher position.Abstract: A brief overview of the situation for nuns in the Tibetan Tradition", "taken from Berzin Summary ReportBerzin Summary Report, Part Three: Day Two, Ven.
