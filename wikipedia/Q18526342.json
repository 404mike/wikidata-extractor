He was most notable for developing the first premature-baby unit in 1947. It was Moncrief who recognised and developed the concept of daily parental visits to the ward, which he developed while at Great Ormond Street, well before the need for this became recognised, and with his ward sister, published an article on Hospital Visiting for Children in 1949.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Institute of Medical Social Workers", "response": ["It was established from two separate associations of hospital almoners. The Almoners' Committee was established in 1903 and successively changed its name to the Hospital Almoners' Committee in 1911, the Association of Hospital Almoners in 1920, and the Hospital Almoners' Association in 1927. The Hospital Almoners' Council was established in 1907 to handle the selection, training and employment of almoners and changed its name to the Institute of Hospital Almoners in 1922. The two amalgamated as the Institute of Almoners in 1945, and this changed its name to the Institute of Medical Social Workers in 1964. Ann Davidson Kelly was its first and only General Secretary. Professor Sir Alan Moncrieff was the President until her retired in 1968 when Enid Warren who was a social worker took over as President."]}, {"page": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health", "response": ["The Institute of Child Health was founded in 1946 by professor Alan Moncrieff with the funding of a chair in child health by the Nuffield Foundation. It acted as a postgraduate school of preventive and therapeutic paediatrics of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and the University of London. Moncrieff served as director until 1964."]}, {"page": "James W. B. Douglas", "response": ["Prior to the war, the falling birth rate in Britain had been a major concern and during the war the idea of a survey was developed by the Population Investigation Committee, an independent group, based at the London School of Economics. The committee appointed the demographer and sociologist, David Glass, to coordinate research and he suggested that Douglas would be a suitable person to conduct the survey. Dr Frank Yates, a statistical advisor to Zuckerman and Dr Richard Schilling, chairman of the Industrial Health Research Board, also supported Douglas's appointment. Douglas like most people at the time, was particularly concerned with inequality, health in society and at home, and family circumstances. So when the job offer presented itself to study Obstetrics in relation to the falling birth rate, Douglas jumped at the opportunity; it would later define his whole life's work. Douglas was appointed to the position of Executive Director of the Maternity Survey of the Joint Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Population Investigation Committee under the aegis of the Royal Commission on Population. Notable members of the committee included vice-chairman,  Sir Alan Moncrieff, with Dermod MacCarthy also on the committee.

Moncrieff was looking for research to be conducted, on a previously researched problem of some importance, threadworn infestations in children. Although most failed to solve the problem, Moncrieff managed to, determining the epidemiology of threadworms and formulating a diagnosis, that is still valid today. He later conducted trials with the drug piperazine to determine its efficacy."]}, {"page": "Alfred White Franklin", "response": ["Franklin became one of the UK's earliest neonatologists, assisting under Alan Moncrieff at Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital.
