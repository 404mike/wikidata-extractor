She submitted the finished product to her agent, who disliked the new manuscript as well, and to various publishing houses, where it was repeatedly rejected.

There is no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to what actually occurred. It is evident that the Epistle and the Gospel were read in both Latin and English, a departure from the Catholic custom. At some point during the mass, Elizabeth withdrew to the \"traverse\", a curtained off area behind the high altar and next to St Edward's shrine, a private space in which the monarch could make the several changes of dress required for the ceremonial. David Starkey asserts that the mass was sung by Bishop Oglethorpe who elevated the host, prompting Elizabeth's early withdrawal.Starkey, p. 276 John GuyGuy p. 179 and Lisa Hilton both state that the royal chaplain, George Carew, sang the mass without elevation and administered Holy Communion to the queen inside the traverse.Hilton, Ch. 9 A. L. Rowse states that Oglethorpe sang the mass and that Elizabeth withdrew before the consecration. Roy Strong writes that Carew sang the mass without elevation, but that Elizabeth did not receive Communion, citing her reported conversation with the French ambassador in 1571 that 'she had been crowned and anointed according to the ceremonies of the Catholic church, and by Catholic bishops without, however, attending mass'.Strong, pp. 208-210 Finally, the queen left the abbey, smiling and exchanging greetings with the crowd, which Il Schifanoya thought 'exceeded the bounds of gravity and decorum'."]}, {"page": "LS Hilton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lisa Hilton (writer)"]}]}}
