He shared Moore's interest in the language of the Aborigines, and shortly after his arrival the two of them commenced a project to produce a dictionary of the Aboriginal language.  By August 1840 the dictionary was largely complete.  Moore took extended leave in March 1841, returning to London for two years.  In 1842, Moore's dictionary was published under the title A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia.", "Moore returned to Western Australia in 1843, when the Swan River Colony was in a severe recession.  Over the next few years, he vigorously opposed a number of proposed measures intended to soften the effects of the recession on leading land holders.  Moore claimed that most of the large land holders that were facing economic ruin had been brought to that position through mismanagement.  His hard line made many influential enemies, and his popularity plummeted.  His views began to attract ridicule both in the Legislative Council and in the press, but he remained influential as he had the confidence of successive governors John Hutt and Andrew Clarke."]}, {"page": "A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia", "response": ["A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia is a book by George Fletcher Moore.
