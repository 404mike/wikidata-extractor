Shiner played a slightly absent-minded mute who tried to make friends with the Flounes; his acts included sparring with audience members who challenged him, and playing a incompetent film director who tries to make a romantic tragedy. British actor Geoff Hoyle replaced Shiner in early 1991 for one-off understudy performances in San Diego & Costa Mesa, California and again for Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Toronto, Ontario & Chicago, Illinois. for those performances, he brought over his \"Mr. Sniff\" and Three-Legged Man skits from the Pickle Family Circus. Hoyle's clown character was more mischievous than Shiner's, often stealing people's possessions and ripping the shirts off unsuspecting audience members. When Shiner left the show in late 1991, Rodrigue \"Chocolat\" Tremblay, who had previously performed in two of Cirque's previous productions, Le Grand Tour & Le Magie Continue, replaced him during the show's performances in Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia. he performed some of the same acts as Shiner, along with his own act, known simply as \"Cloches\" where he would conduct an orchestra of audience members playing bells. When the show re-opened at the Mirage casino in 1992, Tremblay was replaced by another performer named Kenny Raskin, with Gerry Regitschnig and Paul Vachon sometimes serving as understudies."]}, {"page": "I Just Can't Wait to Be King", "response": ["The song appears in the Broadway show and is performed by Scott Irby-Ranniar, Kajuana Shuford, and Geoff Hoyle on the 1997 Original Cast Recording.

In the DVD commentary for the 2003 release of the film, director Lucas Reiner stated that the \"Absentee, oblivious, self-involved parents who don't notice their kids have a spaceship\" was a reference to the self-involved nature of adults during the 1970s and their propensity for self-improvement.  Reiner stated that these scenes were meant to symbolize the \"'70s hunger for self-improvement\" and the extreme ends that people would go to in order to improve themselves.  Lucas Reiner had never personally attended one of Werner Erhard's seminars, but had heard that attendants were not allowed to leave, often peed in their pants, and were called \"assholes\" and insulted publicly.
