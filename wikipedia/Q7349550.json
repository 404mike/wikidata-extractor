The plans were accepted by a majority of 27 in favour to 19 against, supporters including several MPs who had previously supported Derry's bid, in particular the Attorney-General, Jones, who attempted to justify his vote to local party members by claiming that Irish nationalists would benefit from any split in government ranks.  Robert Samuel Nixon, UUP MP for North Down, claimed in May that several prominent Derry-based unionists had opposed building the new university in their own city.  Although he described them as \"nameless, faceless men\", he did name them: Gerald Stanley Glover, former Mayor of Derry; John Brown; J. S. Bond; and Sydney Buchanan.  The majority of them claimed that they had simply accepted a decision which had already been made and had lobbied for Magee College to remain open, and Nixon was expelled from the UUP Parliamentary group."]}]}}
