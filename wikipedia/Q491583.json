He is one of the founding members of the electronic rock band Depeche Mode and is its primary songwriter. Gore is the band's guitarist and keyboardist, contributes backing vocals, and occasionally provides lead vocals. Gore possesses a tenor singing voice which contrasts with Dave Gahan's dramatic baritone and is also known for his flamboyant and (sometimes) androgynous stage persona. Gore has also released several solo albums and collaborated with former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke as part of VCMG.Gore's lyrics included themes such as sex, religion, and politics. Gore has said he feels lyrical themes which tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness are a better representation of reality, whereas he finds \"happy songs\" fake and unrealistic. At the same time, he asserts that the band's music contains \"an element of hope\".In 1999, he received the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for \"International Achievement\". He was given the Moog Innovation Award \"for his many contributions to the exploration of sound in popular music\" in 2019, and became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member in late 2020 with fellow Depeche Mode members Andrew Fletcher and Dave Gahan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Depeche Mode", "response": ["Depeche Mode are an English electronic music band formed in Basildon in 1980.

Fletcher would later recall, \"Why am I in the band? It was accidental right from the beginning. I was actually forced to be in the band. I played the guitar and I had a bass; it was a question of them roping me in.\" In 1979, Clarke played guitar in an \"Ultravox rip-off band\", The Plan, with friends Robert Marlow and Paul Langwith. In 1978\u201379, Martin Gore played guitar in an acoustic duo, Norman and the Worms, with school friend Phil Burdett on vocals.

Clarke and Fletcher then converted to an electronic act, working odd jobs in order to buy synthesizers, or borrowing them from friends; they were soon joined by Martin Gore as a third instrumentalist. Fletcher has listed OMD, the Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Kraftwerk, the Human League, and punk rock as influences on the three men.", "In September 1984, Some Great Reward was released.

Also included was the first Martin Gore ballad, \"Somebody\" \u2014 such songs would become a feature of all following albums. \"Somebody\" was released as a double A-side with \"Blasphemous Rumours\", and was the first single with Gore on lead vocal.

During treatment, doctors found and removed a low grade tumour from the singer's bladder. Gahan's illness caused 16 concerts to be cancelled, but several of the shows were rescheduled for 2010. The band headlined the Lollapalooza festival during the North American leg of the tour. The tour also took the band back to South America for the first time since 1994's Exotic Tour.
