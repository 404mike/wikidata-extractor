In 1868, he took his first long distance trip, up the Cariboo Road to the gold mining town of Barkerville, accompanied by his eleven-year-son Albert, nicknamed \"The General\", who kept the miners entertained with magic tricks and acrobatics. Two years later, Maynard returned alone to his hometown of Bude, and on the way back he stopped to purchase photographic supplies in New York City. In May and June 1873, he received a government commission aboard the gun boat HMS Boxer which journeyed first to New Westminster, then up the east coast of Vancouver Island, continuing past along the mainland as far north as Bella Coola. On the voyage was the first federal Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the province of British Columbia, Israel Wood Powell, and Maynard's role was to document native affairs for the official report. His photographs included the first views of free-standing totem poles among the Kwakwaka'wakw at Klinaklini River, and in Takush Harbour, he took six field portraits of villagers seated against the backdrop of a Hudson's Bay Company blanket. The next year, Maynard was again the photographer on a similar mission with the same vessel, this time on a circumnavigation of Vancouver Island. The photographic results were disappointing due to the incessant bad weather, although his most important images were taken at Yuquot on Nootka Sound."]}, {"page": "Israel Wood Powell", "response": ["Israel Wood Powell may refer to:", "*Israel Wood Powell (Ontario politician)", "*Israel Wood Powell (British Columbia politician)"]}]}}
