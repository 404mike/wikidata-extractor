He was a professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Calgary. He is known for his work in number theory, geometry, recreational mathematics, combinatorics, and graph theory. He is best known for co-authorship (with John Conway and Elwyn Berlekamp) of Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays and authorship of Unsolved Problems in Number Theory. He published more than 300 scholarly articles. Guy proposed the partially tongue-in-cheek \"strong law of small numbers\", which says there are not enough small integers available for the many tasks assigned to them \u2013 thus explaining many coincidences and patterns found among numerous cultures. For this paper he received the MAA Lester R. Ford Award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Horton Conway", "response": ["* 1982 \u2013 Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays (with Richard K.

Their results were published in their book Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays in 1982. However, the first work published on the subject was Conway's 1976 book On Numbers and Games, also known as ONAG, which introduced the concept of surreal numbers and the generalization to games. On Numbers and Games was also a fruit of the collaboration between Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy."]}]}}
