In 1846, the business was inherited by Hardie's nephew, David Sands. Sands had some difficulty finding among his sons a successor, but in 1920 the business passed to David Sands' son, Davee Sands. In 1966, Davee Sands' son David Lindsey took over the business, being joined in 1989 by his son David Sands. At that time, the business consisted of a single convenience shop in Kinross, but it soon expanded with additional outlets and services. By May 2006, it was a retail chain employing more than 450 people. In August 2008, at which point the enterprise had 26 outlets through Fife, Kinross and Perthshire, the chain brought in Ewen Chisholm as chief operating officer, expanding the management of the company beyond family for the first time."]}, {"page": "David Sands (Animal Psychologist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Sands (psychologist)"]}]}}
