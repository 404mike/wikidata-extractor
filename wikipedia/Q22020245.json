He served seven years in the office of constable at Carlisle before being dismissed from his role in 1844. He then became a court bailiff, then a Parish Constable at Longtown.  Until 2006, when a former officer of Cumbria Constabulary discovered Kent's employment records, it was thought that Britain's first black police officer was Norwell Roberts, who was an officer with the Metropolitan Police starting in 1966 (however Astley Lloyd Blair joined Gloucestershire Constabulary as a Special Constable in 1964). The discovery has been heralded by the UK National Black Police Association as having \"huge significance\" as well as being \"totally unexpected\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cumbria Constabulary", "response": ["* PC John Kent - The first black British police officer, who served with the then Carlisle City Police between 1837 and 1844"]}, {"page": "1837 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 17 August \u2013 John Kent becomes Britain's first black police officer on joining the constabulary in Carlisle."]}, {"page": "John Kent", "response": ["John Kent may refer to:", "*John Kent (died 1630) (1559\u20131630), MP for Devizes", "*John Kent (died 1669) (c. 1612\u20131669), English politician, MP for Devizes", "*John Kent (died 1413), MP for Reading", "*John Kent (MP for Bedford), MP for Bedford", "*John Kent (Newfoundland politician) (1805\u20131872), premier of Newfoundland", "*John Kent (cartoonist) (1937\u20132003), New Zealand cartoonist", "*John Kent (hymnist) (1766\u20131843) English Calvinist Baptist hymn writer", "*John Kent (police officer) (1795\u20131886) The first Black British police officer"]}, {"page": "Norwell Roberts", "response": ["Norwell Lionel Roberts  (n\u00e9 Gumbs; born 23 October 1946) is a British former police constable\u2014the first black police officer to join London's Metropolitan Police.
