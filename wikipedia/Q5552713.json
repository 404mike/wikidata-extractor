These songs, recorded in New York City at the Axis Studios, Power Station and Whorga Musica, were the only tracks recorded outside the UK.;  Minogue said, \"I was feeling a bit like a ping-pong ball for a while, with the American and English both wanting different things.\" Minogue recorded a song entitled \"Intuition\" during these sessions, which was shelved until 2019, when Harry gave the demo to American singer Liz for her album Planet Y2K. Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, better known as Pet Shop Boys, were approached by Minogue's camp after the pair finished work on Very (1993). They declined initially, but Lowe came up with a set of chords that Tennet found similar to Minogue's previous work with SAW and suggested they turn it into a song for her.;  The demo for \"Falling\" was sent to Deconstruction, where it was reworked by Fire Island, an English music duo made up of Pete Heller and Terry Farley. Tennet found the result very different from the original demo, saying, \"It doesn't really have the same tune in it, for instance, and they haven't put the chorus in, but I suppose that's very modern.\" Minogue's label mate M People produced \"Time Will Pass You By\" for Kylie Minogue but could not commit to do more because of a busy schedule. Gerry DeVeaux, songwriter and Kravitz's cousin, produced and co-wrote \"Surrender\" with composer Charlie Mole.;  Three of the songs on the album are cover versions of largely unknown tracks: \"Where Has The Love Gone?\", \"Time Will Pass You By\" and \"Where Is the Feeling?\".", "*Gerry DeVeaux \u2013 production, arrangement"]}, {"page": "Black Diamond (Angie Stone album)", "response": ["* Gerry DeVeaux \u2013 background vocals", "* Gerry DeVeaux \u2013 production ; executive production"]}, {"page": "Circus (Lenny Kravitz album)", "response": ["# \"Circus\" (Gerry DeVeaux, Terry Britten, Kravitz) \u2013 4:48"]}, {"page": "Bliss (Vanessa Paradis album)", "response": ["# \"La La La Song\" (Gerry DeVeaux, Paradis)  4:25"]}, {"page": "Robyn Loau", "response": ["! scope=\"row\"| \"Never Miss the Water\" (with Gerry DeVeaux, Shauna Jensen and Michal Nicolas) "]}, {"page": "Live (Vanessa Paradis album)", "response": ["# \"Be My Baby\"  3:50  (Gerry DeVeaux, Kravitz; Vanessa Paradis)"]}, {"page": "Au Z\u00e9nith", "response": ["# \"La La La Song\"  4:12  (Gerry DeVeaux, Paradis; Bliss)"]}, {"page": "Britain's Next Top Model (series 4)", "response": ["* Gerry DeVeaux"]}, {"page": "Miss Universe 2009", "response": ["* Gerry DeVeaux \u2013 Award-winning Producer, Songwriter and Style Guru"]}, {"page": "Epiphany: The Best of Chaka Khan, Vol. 1", "response": ["Another seven recordings from the Dare You To Love Me sessions have surfaced on movie soundtracks, compilations or other artists' albums; \"Miles Blowin'\" (a tribute to the late Miles Davis, included on the Sugar Hill soundtrack, 1994), \"Free Yourself\" (on the To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!
