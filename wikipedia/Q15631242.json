The entries for the competition were somewhat more limited than those of recent years due to the final men's Olympic qualifier which took place in Trabzon, Turkey the month previous, therefore no Olympians entered. Great Britain Performance Director, Robert McCracken said, \"It will be a fantastic opportunity to assess the next generation and identify some of the talents that will be challenging to be part of the GB squad for the next cycle.\" A selection of the event's final bouts were broadcast live on BBC channel, BBC Two and the tournament was sponsored by Betfair for a second successive year. The most notable bouts of the finals took place in the 56\u00a0kg and 91+kg categories as Leeds boxer Qais Ashfaq boxed cleverly to overcome Wales' Sean McGoldrick who had already beat him in a previous bout. The super-heavyweight final involved Joe Joyce and Frazer Clark who landed punishing blows on each other for 4 thrilling rounds, which Joyce shaded by a single point by a score of 37:36. Also, Liverpool puncher Anthony Fowler, who boxes out of Golden Gloves ABC, claimed his second Great British title in as many years with a victory over Tamuka Muchapondwa by a convincing score of 28:14, while 49\u00a0kg Jack Bateson beat Ashley Williams 21:17 to claim gold.", "| Jack Bateson (ENG)"]}, {"page": "GB Boxing", "response": ["| Jack Bateson ||  ENG || Light Flyweight || ROUND OF 32"]}, {"page": "2013 AIBA World Boxing Championships \u2013 Light flyweight", "response": ["#  Jack Bateson (Second round)"]}, {"page": "Ashley Williams (boxer)", "response": ["In 2012 Williams was selected to represent Wales at the amateur Olympic Gloves tournament in Estonia.
