Most are geographically very small, but range in size from a single square foot to half a million square miles (Westarctica).  They are usually the outgrowth of a single individual.\nA micronation expresses a formal and persistent if unrecognized claim of sovereignty over some physical territory. Micronations are distinct from true secessionist movements; micronations' activities are almost always trivial enough to be ignored rather than challenged by the established nations whose territory they claim. Several micronations have issued coins, flags, postage stamps, passports, medals and other state-related items, often as a source of revenue.\nThe term \"micronation\" to describe those entities dates at least to the 1970s. The term micropatrology is sometimes used to describe the study of both micronations and microstates by micronationalists, some of whom refer to sovereign nation-states as \"macronations\"Micronations contrast with microstates, which are small but recognized sovereign states such as Andorra, Bahrain, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Singapore, and Vatican City. They are also distinct from imaginary countries and from other kinds of social groups (such as eco-villages, campuses, tribes, clans, sects, and residential community associations).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sheringham", "response": ["*\"King Nicholas I\" changed his name by deed poll from Nick Copeman and set up a new empire from his royal seat, a caravan just outside town.King Nicholas and the Copeman Empire (Paperback), by Nick Copeman  King Nicholas I often appeared on TV and radio around the time his book was launched."]}, {"page": "Copeman", "response": ["* Nick Copeman (born 1979), author"]}]}}
