While at Cambridge, he rowed in three successive Boat Races (1934\u201336) in which Cambridge defeated Oxford.  During the 1935 and 1936 races, he rowed alongside Ran Laurie, who became his rowing partner after Cambridge and a lifelong friend.\nAfter graduating from University, Wilson took a post as a District Commissioner with the Sudan Political Service, missing an opportunity to participate alongside Laurie in Britain\u2019s Eights boat at the 1936 Olympics.  With Laurie joining the Sudan Political Service the following year, the two men joined forces in rowing and, while on leave from colonial service in 1938, won the Silver Goblets at Henley Royal Regatta.Both Wilson and Laurie returned to Sudan following their success, and continued to serve in the Sudan Political Service through the Second World War. In 1942, Wilson survived an attack by a local woman in Sudan who threw an assegai spear at him.In 1948 Wilson and Laurie returned to Henley and once again won the Silver Goblets, having had little training and no opportunity to row since their success in the event ten years earlier.  This was followed later that year by an Olympic gold medal, once again rowing at Henley.Wilson retired from colonial service in 1954 and worked for the British Steel Corporation.  He died in 1997, aged 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Wilson", "response": ["* Jack Wilson (1894\u20131970), vaudeville actor, part of Wilson, Keppel and Betty", "* Jack Wilson (pianist) (1907\u20132006), British jazz pianist from Warwickshire, England", "* Jack Wilson (jazz pianist) (1936\u20132007), American jazz pianist from Chicago", "* Jack Wilson (writer) (1937\u20131997), Northern Irish novelist", "* Jack Wilson (Home and Away), a character in the Australian soap opera Home and Away", "* Jack Wilson (Yorkshire cricketer) (1889\u20131959), British cricketer, World War I pilot, and jockey", "* Jack Wilson (footballer) (1897\u2013?), English footballer", "* Jack Wilson (pitcher) (1912\u20131995), pitcher in baseball", "* Jack Wilson (rower) (1914\u20131997), British rower and Olympic champion in 1948", "* Jack Wilson (American football) (1917\u20132001), first-round pick of the Cleveland Rams in 1942", "* Jack Wilson (boxer) (1918\u20131956), American boxer and Olympic medalist in 1936", "* Jack Wilson (Australian cricketer) (1921\u20131985), Australian cricketer", "* Jack Wilson (basketball) (1936\u20131986), American college basketball player and high school basketball coach", "* Jack Wilson (infielder) (born 1977), former American baseball player", "* Jack Wilson (rugby union) (born 1989), New Zealand rugby union player", "* Wovoka (1856\u20131932), Northern Paiute Indian prophet also known as Jack Wilson", "* Jack Wilson (engineer) (1905\u20131972), English-Australian engineer and founder of Wilson Transformers", "* Jack Wilson (judge) (born 1978/9), American judge", "* Jack Wilson (political advisor) (born 1996), Britian's youngest senior political advisor as of 2017"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1948 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|  || Jack Wilson || Rowing || Men's coxless pair || ", "|align=left|Ran LaurieJack Wilson"]}, {"page": "List of Old Salopians", "response": ["* Jack Wilson (1914\u20131997), Olympic rower"]}, {"page": "Ran Laurie", "response": ["Laurie rowed for Cambridge in the 1934, 1935, and 1936 boat races, all of which were won by Cambridge.
