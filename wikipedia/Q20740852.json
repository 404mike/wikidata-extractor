In an interview with Crack Magazine Fisher said: \"[...] something like the Arctic Monkeys, there is no relation to historicity. They\u2019re clearly a retro group, but the category of retro doesn\u2019t make any sense anymore because it\u2019s retro compared to what?\" and \"Arctic Monkeys airbrush cultural time out and appeal to this endless return and timelessness of rock\"."]}, {"page": "Y (album)", "response": ["To record their debut, the group teamed with British dub reggae producer Dennis Bovell. Critic Simon Reynolds wrote that \"Bovell's mix of acid-rock wildness and dub wisdom made him [...] the ideal candidate for the not hugely enviable task of giving The Pop Group's unruly sound some semblance of cohesion,\" noting that he grounded the band's sound in its rhythm section while utilizing a variety of production effects. Writing for Fact, Mark Fisher characterized the album's sound as a \"delirial montage of funk, free jazz, Jamaican audio-mancy and the avant-garde,\" describing it as \"both carvernous and propulsive, ultra-abstract yet driven by dance music\u2019s physical imperatives.\" He noted the \"sonic alchemy\" of Bovell's production work. PopMatters wrote that the group \"sharpened the straightforward guitar lines of punk, the bounding throb of funk rhythms, and the sonic manipulation of dub and let them penetrate each other in ridiculously slapdash fashion.\"", "Upon its release, Y received mixed reviews. In 1979, the NME described it as \"a brave failure. Exciting but exasperating.\" In recent years, the album has risen in critical estimations. Simon Reynolds called it \"a heroic mess, glorious in its overreach.\" In 2008, Mark Fisher wrote \"Joy Division\u2019s Closer is often considered the crown jewel of post-punk, but Y \u2013 inchoate with potential, the fire to Joy Division\u2019s ice \u2013 has an equal claim.\" Stylus Magazine called the album \"a landmark of lunatic post-punk,\" writing that \"these are political punk tunes deconstructed so that only the skeleton remains, and weaving between those bare bones are some of the nastiest sounds ever made.\""]}, {"page": "The Caretaker (musician)", "response": ["Jon Fletcher describes the release as \"the labyrinthian set is a k-hole for the mind. Vague clouds of noise, barely flickering signals of life, only the starkest traces of past romanticism (no matter how poignant)- nothing to cling onto.\" Mark Fisher contrasts this album with the Caretaker's previous output: \"If his earlier records suggested spaces that were mildewed but still magnificent - grand hotels gone to seed, long-abandoned ballrooms - Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia invokes sites that have deteriorated into total dereliction, where every unidentified noise is pregnant with menace.\"", "In 2017, Kirby released Take Care. It's a Desert Out There..., following the suicide of his collaborator Mark Fisher, who was suffering with depression. It features a single track in its 48-minute runtime, with previously unreleased music by the Caretaker. Kirby's initial intention would be to give Take Care for people attending at his Krak\u00f3w Barbican performance. However, its high demand caused him to share it on the internet. Released in a CD, it included a message stating its proceeds would be donated to the mental health charity Mind.", "The Caretaker sees his work as a collaborative process, stressing the importance of LUPO's mastering, the visuals of weirdcore.tv, and longtime album-artist Ivan Seal as a key part of his process. Theorist Mark Fisher had a symbiotic relationship with the Caretaker, contributing the liner notes to Theoretically Pure Antiretrograde Amnesia as well as putting his work in critical context, often taking the Caretaker as a jumping off point for his political ideas. Following Fisher's death, the Caretaker released Take Care, It's a Desert Out There as a memorial album, after one of the writer's quotes, with proceeds going to the mental health charity Mind.", "Mark Fisher played a major role in theorising the Caretaker's sound. He names the Caretaker as a key hauntology artist, alongside \"William Basinski, the Ghost Box label...Burial, Mordant Music, Philip Jeck, amongst others\" who had \"converged on a certain terrain without directly influencing one another...suffused with an overwhelming melancholy; and they were preoccupied with the way in which technology materialised memory\" - in the Caretaker's case, that of vinyl records. He identifies the \"crackle\" of vinyl as \"the principle sonic signature of hauntology\" which \"makes us aware that we are listening to a time that is out of joint\", signalling \"the return of a certain sense of loss\" which \"invokes the past and marks our distance from it\". Fisher connects the Caretaker's sound to his wider project of describing capitalist realism - the political idea that \"not only has the future not arrived, it no longer seems possible\", and hauntology's melancholia to capitalist realism's \"closed horizons\". Fisher contributed liner notes to Theoretically Pure Anterograde Amnesia, describing it as \"uneasy listening\"; in contrast to the Caretaker's earlier works, \"the threat is no longer the deadly sweet seduction of nostalgia. The problem is not, any more, the longing to get *to* the past but the inability to get *out* of it\"."]}, {"page": "Deaths of philosophers", "response": ["*2017 \u2013 Mark Fisher committed suicide by hanging."]}, {"page": "Burial (Burial album)", "response": ["\"Night Bus\", instrumentated with a \"beat-free Gorecki-like waft of mournful strings\", represents the sadness of when Londoners, after clubbing, go through difficult public transport options because they're unable to afford cabs back to Zones three, four, five or six, low-rent areas where they reside. This gloom is offset by the romance and greatness of the city as seen from a top deck, \"neon twinkling like a recumbent Milky Way.\" According to Reynolds, the album also regards the \"keep-the-faith conservatism\" in dubstep which Mark Fisher argued was a requiem or funeral tribute for the culture of rave, an example being \"Gutted\", which includes a faltering yet stoic low-key male vocal sample declaring, \"me and him, we're from different, ancient tribes ... now we're both almost extinct ... sometimes ... you gotta stick with the ancients ... old school ways.\""]}, {"page": "List of people who died by hanging", "response": ["*Mark Fisher, English writer, music critic, cultural theorist, philosopher and teacher (13 January 2017)"]}, {"page": "Simon Reynolds", "response": ["Reynolds' writing has blended cultural criticism with music journalism. He has written extensively on gender, class, race, and sexuality in relation to music and culture.
