Unfortunately for Vargas Llosa, his involvement with the Investigatory Commission led to immediate negative reactions and defamation from the Peruvian press; many suggested that the massacre was a conspiracy to keep the journalists from reporting the presence of government paramilitary forces in Uchuraccay. The commission concluded that it was the indigenous villagers who had been responsible for the killings; for Vargas Llosa the incident showed \"how vulnerable democracy is in Latin America and how easily it dies under dictatorships of the right and left\".Qtd.  These conclusions, and Vargas Llosa personally, came under intense criticism: anthropologist Enrique Mayer, for instance, accused him of \"paternalism\",Qtd.  while fellow anthropologist Carlos Iv\u00e1n Degregori criticized him for his ignorance of the Andean world.Qtd.  Vargas Llosa was accused of actively colluding in a government cover-up of army involvement in the massacre. US Latin American literature scholar Misha Kokotovic summarizes that the novelist was charged with seeing \"indigenous cultures as a 'primitive' obstacle to the full realization of his Western model of modernity\". Shocked both by the atrocity itself and then by the reaction his report had provoked, Vargas Llosa responded that his critics were apparently more concerned with his report than with the hundreds of peasants who later died at the hands of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla organization.Qtd.

Asturias' writing style in Leyendas de Guatemala has been described by some as \"historia-sue\u00f1o-poemas\" (history-dream-poem). In each legend, Asturias draws the reader in with a fury of beauty and mystery without being able to comprehend the sense of space and time.Castelpoggi, p. 27 Leyendas de Guatemala brought Asturias critical praise in France as well as in Guatemala.

In taking such liberties, there are many possibilities for error. However, Lourdes Royano Guti\u00e9rrez argues that his work remains valid because in this literary situation, intuition served as a better tool than scientific analysis. In accordance, Jean Franco categorizes Asturias along with Rosario Castellanos and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas as \"Indianist\" authors. She argues that all three of these writers were led to \"break with realism precisely because of the limitations of the genre when it came to representing the Indian\".
