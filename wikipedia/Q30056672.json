He was particularly known for his scholarly studies on Benjamin Britten and William Byrd and for his contributions to the development of lesbian and gay musicology.Adams (October 31, 2002) At the time of his death, he was Distinguished Professor of Musicology at the University of California, Los Angeles.", "Philip Brett was born in Edwinstowe, a coal-mining village in north Nottinghamshire, England. His father was a collier and his mother a school teacher. He was educated first at the choir school of Southwell Minster and then attended King's College, Cambridge as a choral scholar. He received his BA degree from Cambridge in 1958 and a MusB in 1961, studying under Philip Radcliffe, Boris Ord and Thurston Dart. After a year studying at University of California, Berkeley with Joseph Kerman, he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of King's College and completed his PhD there in 1965. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the songs of William Byrd, a composer on whom Brett would write extensively throughout his career. In 1966 he joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley and remained there for nearly 25 years. He  was made a full professor in 1978 and went on to become chairman of the music department in 1988. During his time at Berkeley, he became a naturalised US citizen and participated in the musical life of the university both as a recitalist and as a choral conductor in addition to his teaching.Anderson (October 21, 2002)", "In 1991, Brett moved to University of California, Riverside to be with his long-term partner, George Haggerty, a professor of English there.San Jose Mercury News (July 29, 1990)  He was appointed Associate Dean of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences at Riverside in 1998, a position which he held until 2001 when he became Distinguished Professor of Musicology at University of California, Los Angeles. Brett died of cancer in Los Angeles at the age of 64, a year after taking up his appointment at UCLA. On the 6th anniversary of his death, the University of California, Riverside dedicated the Philip Brett Memorial Peace Garden, a traditional Japanese Karesansui designed by Takeo Uesugi.University of California, Riverside, Philip Brett Memorial Peace Garden  The annual Philip Brett Award from the American Musicological Society honors exceptional musicological work in the field of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender/transsexual studies.American Musicological Society, The Philip Brett Award", "In 1976, Brett delivered a paper on Benjamin Britten's opera Peter Grimes at a national meeting of the American Musicological Society. The paper, published as an article by The Musical Times the following year, proposed that study of Britten's sexual identity could illuminate the interpretation of his music. It was the first time that this aspect of Britten had been considered in print. Britten's homosexuality had previously been what Antony Bye described as \"off limits, an 'open secret' recognised but not publicly acknowledged.\" The reaction was mixed, and when Brett initially submitted the paper to The Musical Quarterly for publication, the then editor, Joan Peyser, dismissed it as \"a personality study\".Brett (1990) p. 45 However, Brett continued to explore the relationship between Britten's sexuality and his operas. In the succeeding years he wrote a series of influential articles and books both on Britten and on the more general implications of gay and lesbian sexuality in music. The discipline gradually entered the academic mainstream as part of the 'new musicology' with the American Musicological Society's Gay and Lesbian Study Group (co-founded  by Brett) established in 1989.Now called the LGBTQ Study Group (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) The 2001 edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, contained, for the first time in its history, an article on gay and lesbian music (co-written by Philip Brett and Elizabeth Wood).Brett and Wood (December 2002)Church (30 December 2000)", "*\"Homosexuality and Music: A Conversation with Philip Brett\" in Lawrence Mass (ed.), Dialogues of the Sexual Revolution: Homosexuality as Behavior and Identity, Routledge, 1990", "*Queering the Pitch: The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology, Philip Brett, Elizabeth Wood and Gary Thomas (editors), Routledge, 1994", "*Cruising the Performative: Interventions into the Representation of Ethnicity, Nationality, and Sexuality, Sue-Ellen Case, Philip Brett, Susan Leigh Foster (editors),  Indiana University Press, 1995", "*Decomposition: Post-disciplinary Performance, Sue-Ellen Case, Philip Brett, Susan Leigh Foster (editors), Indiana University Press, 2000", "*William Byrd, The Byrd Edition, Stainer & Bell.
