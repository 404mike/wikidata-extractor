The club's ground, The Stoop, is named in his memory. \n\nHis association with Harlequins lasted from his debut against Oxford University in November 1901 until 1950 when he ended his 30-year stint as president of the club. He played his last game in Quins colours in 1939, at the age of 56. He made 182 appearances in total, captained the side 143 times and scored 86 tries, being club captain for 8 consecutive seasons from 1906/07 to 1913/14.\nStoop was born on 27 March 1883 in Cromwell Road, London. His father was Dutch and his mother was half Scottish/half Irish. He went to Dover College in 1896 and on to Rugby School in 1898, where he played for the school team, and then to Oxford University, where he was captain of the rugby team in 1904.\nIt was whilst he was still at Rugby school that he was asked to join Harlequins. He had also been approached by Blackheath, who at the time were a bigger name than Quins, but he decided to accept the offer from Quins.\nIn 1905, Stoop made his debut for England against Scotland and it was also against Scotland that he earned the last of his 15 caps in 1912. During this time he captained the national side twice, including the first ever international played at Twickenham in 1910. Had it not been for a broken collarbone in 1907 he would have added to his international appearances.\nStoop is widely credited with revolutionising back play. Previously, the two half backs were designated as \"left and right\", but Stoop incorporated ideas already being used in Wales and New Zealand to introduce the concept of the Scrum Half and Outside Half. He used these ideas to great success for both Harlequins and England.\nAs well as being club captain from 1906\u20131914, Stoop was secretary from 1905\u201314 and from 1920-38 as well as president from 1920\u20131950. He was also president of the RFU in 1932 and was a member of the selection committee. In addition to Quins and England he also represented Oxford University, Surrey and The Barbarians. \nHe was keen beekeeper and ornithologist\nHe died on 27 November 1957, aged 74. He is buried at Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, where he had lived for many years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adrian", "response": ["*Adrian Stoop (1883\u20131957), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Dover College", "response": ["* Adrian Stoop (1883\u20131957); Rugby player after whom the Stoop Memorial ground is named"]}, {"page": "Harlequin F.C.", "response": ["Harlequins play at the Twickenham Stoop, which is situated in Twickenham in south-west London.

In 2005, the club formally renamed it as Twickenham Stoop Stadium, but it is colloquially known simply as The Stoop, with even the Harlequins' official website frequently using the informal name."]}, {"page": "Ronald Poulton", "response": ["Ronnie Poulton was one of the most able and most discussed rugby players in the history of the game. He followed in the steps of Adrian Stoop, who was one of the great innovators of rugby tactics, both at Oxford and Harlequins. Poulton was still at school when Stoop went up to Oxford and played in the Varsity matches of 1902, 1903, and, as captain, 1904. At Oxford, Stoop already applied an intelligent approach to improving the game with rigorous attention to detail, and new ideas about changing the direction of attack, and deliberately surprising the opponent's defence.", "Poulton received only one cap for England in 1910, in the first international rugby match to be played at Twickenham, on 15 January 1910 against Wales. Ben Gronow kicked off and sent the ball directly to Adrian Stoop, England's captain and flyhalf. In a break with orthodox play, which required him to kick the ball back into touch, Stoop began an angled run from the right side towards the far left corner. He then passed the ball to Bert Solomon at centre, and from there it moved on quickly to John Birkett and then Poulton on the left wing. Poulton was out of space and put in a kick towards the posts, and after England regathered the ball, Dai Gent, at scrumhalf, sent the ball towards Fred Chapman on the right wing, who on receiving it scored in the corner. England dominated the first half to lead 11\u20133 at half time, and Wales were only managed to close the score with one try to 11\u20136."]}]}}
