Defoe has also played for the England national team.\nDefoe began his career with Charlton Athletic, joining their youth team aged 14, before moving to West Ham United aged 16 and rising through the ranks. He made his first-team debut for West Ham in 2000 and, after a season-long loan spell at AFC Bournemouth during the 2000\u201301 season, established himself in the West Ham line-up. After West Ham's relegation in 2003, a move to Tottenham Hotspur in January 2004 soon followed, where Defoe played for four years before being sold to Portsmouth in January 2008. He spent one season at Fratton Park before returning to Tottenham in the January 2009 transfer window. He left for Toronto of Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2014, before returning to England in January 2015 to sign for Sunderland where he stayed until the club was relegated from the Premier League in 2017. Following a brief spell at AFC Bournemouth in 2017, Defoe joined Scottish team Rangers in 2018 on loan. The move was later made permanent. At his new club he was involved in winning the 2020\u201321 league title. This was the first league title in his career at the age of 38. \nIn April 2011, Defoe became the 20th player to score a century of Premier League goals, and is currently the ninth-highest goalscorer in Premier League history as well as the sixth highest goalscorer in Tottenham's history. Defoe also holds the Premier League record for the most goals scored as a substitute, with 22, as of 11 January 2014. On 19 November 2016, Defoe scored his 150th Premier League goal, becoming the joint tenth-highest goal scorer in Premier League history.Defoe made his England debut in 2004 and has made 57 appearances, scoring 20 goals, including three appearances and a goal at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 7", "response": ["*  1982   \u2013 Jermain Defoe, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1982", "response": ["** Jermain Defoe, English footballer"]}, {"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["They have also displayed a particular zeal when it comes to abusing former players particularly those who are perceived to have abandoned the club, or performed some disservice.

However, players such as Joe Cole, Michael Carrick, Rio Ferdinand, Bobby Zamora and Carlos Tevez receive applause and even standing ovations in honour of their contributions during their time at the club. Joe Cole subsequently rejoined West Ham from Liverpool midway through the 2012\u201313 season.", "West Ham have strong rivalries with several other clubs. Most of these are with other London clubs, especially with Tottenham Hotspur in an East versus North London derby and with Chelsea in an East versus West London rivalry. The rivalry between West Ham and Tottenham has been fuelled by players such as Michael Carrick, Martin Peters, Paul Allen, Jermain Defoe and Scott Parker leaving the Hammers to join Tottenham. The rivalry deepened with the appointment of former Hammers manager Harry Redknapp as Tottenham's manager. Since the 2006\u201307 Premier League season, West Ham have developed a strong rivalry with Yorkshire club Sheffield United due to the dubious circumstances surrounding the transfer of Carlos Tevez, who helped West Ham avoid relegation at Sheffield United's expense.", "|2003|| Joe Cole|| Jermain Defoe"]}, {"page": "Alan Shearer", "response": ["*Most Premier League goals in a single match: 5Held jointly with Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Dimitar Berbatov, Jermain Defoe and Andy Cole."]}, {"page": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C.", "response": ["Tottenham's record league win is 9\u20130 against Bristol Rovers in the Second Division on 22 October 1977.
