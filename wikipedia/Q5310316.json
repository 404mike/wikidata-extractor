The club spent some serious money in pre-season in order to bolster their strike force, as they hoped to clinch the elusive Conference title at last. The huge sum of nearly \u00a3300,000 was spent on new players, including Duane Darby, a \u00a3100,000 purchase from Notts County and Justin Jackson from Morecambe, for whom \u00a3180,000 was paid. Jackson's fee was an unprecedented amount of money paid between two non-league clubs. The brand new Dr. Martens Sports and Exhibition Centre was opened in early summer, containing gymnasium, management offices and recreational facilities amongst other offerings. With promotion being an absolute must, a great start soon tailed off and Diamonds trailed Yeovil Town at Christmas time by a huge margin.  However, despite some fans calling for Brian Talbot's head, Max Griggs' faith would be rewarded. A run of just one defeat from the remaining 23 matches saw the deficit clawed back. The club eventually finished six points ahead of their title rivals, securing promotion into Football League Division Three with a 2\u20131 win at Chester City.", "Following Hill's resignation, the free management position was applied for by over 50 people, including ex-West Ham player Julian Dicks, as well as Rushden legends Duane Darby, Paul Hall and Paul Underwood. Justin Edinburgh, caretaker manager, was given the job until the end of the season. Within the space of a few games, Edinburgh breathed new life in the club as for the first time in years, the team began to play with an air of self-confidence and without fear. As well as a successful start to his RDFC managing career, (earning ten points from a possible fifteen in his first five games), the standard of play and the overall entertainment value rose dramatically, with several players rediscovering performances that some had not brought forth in years. A 1\u20130 win over rivals Kettering merely heightened this sense of relief and recovery. The season ended with a 3\u20131 win over already-relegated Woking FC. The result ensured their final position as 11th, their highest finish in a league table since the Division 3 title was won in 2003. The season also ended pleasantly with the knowledge that nearly 1,000 extra people had visited Nene Park that season for league games, seeing a rise in the average league attendance for the first time in years."]}]}}
