A 1917 book titled Peeps into the Deaf World records him as saying: \"I am a great reader, and have read history, biography, books on travel, religion, and novels, besides the daily newspapers, and it is a great comfort \u2013 this reading \u2013 to one who is deaf, and to whom little is said.\" His friends included Samuel Bright Lucas, son of suffragette Margaret Bright Lucas and nephew of MP John Bright, and wood engraver Charles Webb Moore, who was part of Frank Brangwyn's circle and responsible for Davidson's portrait. He was the father of artist Allan Douglas Davidson (1873-1932)."]}]}}
