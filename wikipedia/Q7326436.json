There he introduced a number of important works, including Delius' Appalachia and A Song of the High Hills.

Sadly, few of these have survived. We know them only from programme notes and hearsay. In 1946 he was elected to the Chair of Music at Cambridge University. He retained this post until his retirement in 1962.
