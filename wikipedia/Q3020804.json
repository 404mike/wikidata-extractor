However, in her debrief with the UCI she said she would look at comments from riders, the impact of the full road closures along the route and the crowd restrictions on Box Hill.

However, riders complained about parts of the first part of the course; Dumoulin commenting that it was \"a little dangerous.\" The Director also noted that the a section of the Box Hill area would be widened.

She says that growing up, there were no indoor tennis courts in Scotland, so she played tennis in the summer and badminton in the winter. She won 64 titles in Scotland during her junior and senior career, and decided to have a go at the professional tour in around 1976. Murray gave up the idea of competing professionally as she was homesick and was robbed in Barcelona. However, she had played against players such as Debbie Jevans and Mariana Simionescu. Murray claims that her playing style did not have any big shots but she was quick around the court and read the game well. She decided to go to the University of Edinburgh to study French and German, before dropping German in favour of business studies. In 1981, she graduated from the University of Edinburgh, and represented Great Britain at the World Student Games. She began coaching and was the initial coach for both her sons before handing over the reins as their professional careers bloomed.Donald McRae, Judy Murray: I would love to have given it a go as a player, The Guardian, 16 June 2014  In the early 1980s, Murray lived in the West End of Glasgow and was a member of Broomhill Lawn Tennis and Squash club, winning the Club Championships three times and playing for its teams (under her maiden name).
