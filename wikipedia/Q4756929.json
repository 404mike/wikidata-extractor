They were a relatively well known underground band (Jarcrew never enjoyed mainstream success) for approximately five years between 2000 and their early 2005 split. They played a bizarre mixture of electronica/house and prog-rock/punk/funk that baffled audiences up and down the UK (despite their somewhat unapproachable commercial nature they were offered some very lucrative support slots, including an elusive support for Scots rockers Biffy Clyro). Since disbanding, several Jarcrew off-shoots have emerged, most notably Future of the Left, a band that contained Jarcrew frontman Kelson alongside ex-mclusky members Andrew Falkous and Jack Egglestone. In 2014, the band reformed for a charity fundraiser and have since made a number of other appearances.", "On 26 August 2014, Newport's Le Pub venue, which is facing closure, announced via Twitter that Jarcrew would be reforming for a one-off show supporting 'Mclusky' (mclusky's Andrew Falkous and Jack Egglestone, with Million Dead/Future of the Left bassist Julia Ruzicka filling in for original bassist Jon Chapple) on Saturday 8 November. All proceeds generated from ticket sales would go towards the \u00a310,000 goal which would pay to soundproof the venue and keep it in business. Mclusky and Jarcrew performed again a week later in Cardiff's Clwb Ifor Bach, for the same cause.
