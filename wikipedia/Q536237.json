Fearing for his life, Le Gastelois felt compelled to leave Jersey to live on the small island six miles to the north east of Jersey, having been treated as a criminal and ostracised by many who lived on Jersey. Ten years later, on 10 July 1971, the real criminal, Edward Paisnel, nicknamed the Beast of Jersey, was caught and on 29 November 1971, was sentenced to jail for 13 attacks; this ended an 11-year reign of terror.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alphonse (given name)", "response": ["* Alphonse Le Gastelois (1914\u20132012), a Jerseyman who became a hermit on the \u00c9cr\u00e9hous islands to avoid persecution"]}, {"page": "\u00c9cr\u00e9hous", "response": ["Though they are only inhabited sporadically by holidaymakers and fishermen, in the past there have been more permanent residents on the Ecrehos due to more abundant vegetation.
