One school of thought, founded in the works of Derek Bickerton,See  and, for more recent advances,  sees syntax as a branch of biology, since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human mind. Other linguists (e.g., Gerald Gazdar) take a more Platonistic view, since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract formal system.Ted Briscoe, 2 May 2001, Interview with Gerald Gazdar .

Partee developed a linguistically plausible system which incorporated the key insights of both Montague Grammar and Transformational grammar. Early research in linguistic formal semantics used Partee's system to achieve a wealth of empirical and conceptual results. Later work by Irene Heim, Angelika Kratzer, Tanya Reinhart, Robert May and others built on Partee's work to further reconcile it with the generative approach to syntax. The resulting framework is known as the Heim and Kratzer system, after the authors of the textbook Semantics in Generative Grammar which first codified and popularized it. The Heim and Kratzer system differs from earlier approaches in that it incorporates a level of syntactic representation called logical form which undergoes semantic interpretation. Thus, this system often includes syntactic representations and operations which were introduced by translation rules in Montague's system. However, work by others such as Gerald Gazdar proposed models of the syntax-semantics interface which stayed closer to Montague's, providing a system of interpretation in which denotations could be computed on the basis of surface structures. These approaches live on in frameworks such as categorial grammar and combinatory categorial grammar."]}, {"page": "Gazdar", "response": ["*Gerald Gazdar (b. 1950), linguist and computer scientist"]}, {"page": "List of Old Bradfieldians", "response": ["*Gerald Gazdar (born 1950), Professor of Computational Linguistics at the University of Sussex"]}, {"page": "Ann Copestake", "response": ["Copestake was educated at the University of Cambridge where she was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences.
