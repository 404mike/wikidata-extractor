Born at Boconnoc in Cornwall, Phillimore was, like his father (Admiral Sir Augustus Phillimore (1822-97)) before him, and four brothers, educated at Westminster School (1886-91), where he was a Queen's Scholar, before going on to read Literae Humaniores (Classics) at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was also President of the Oxford Union. After taking his degree, he remained at Christ Church as a Student (Fellow and Tutor) until 1899, when he was made Professor of Greek at the University of Glasgow; in 1906 he became Professor of Humanity at the same university. Though he was invited to give the Sather Lectures at the University of California, Berkeley, he was unable to do so because of the First World War. Phillimore was a convert to Roman Catholicism.", "link_mentions": {}}}
