Soon afterwards she returned with her husband to England. Ten other volumes of tales and novels were published between 1846 and 1866. She sometimes made use of her experiences in Australia, especially in Bengala, or Some Time Ago (1860). Some of these books ran into more than one edition. She died in 1873 and was survived by her husband, six sons (including George William Vidal) and a daughter."]}, {"page": "Vidal", "response": ["*George William Vidal (1845\u20131907), British civil servant in India"]}, {"page": "G.
