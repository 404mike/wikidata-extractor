(2002)", "response": ["Cardiff had entered the FA Cup in the first round in November 2001 where they were drawn against non-League opponents Tiverton Town. The match was switched to Cardiff's Ninian Park over safety concerns at Tiverton's Ladysmead ground. Cardiff advanced after securing a 3\u20131 victory with goals from Leo Fortune-West, Paul Brayson and Robert Earnshaw. One month later, Cardiff defeated Port Vale 3\u20130 in the second round of the competition to reach the third round for the third consecutive season. The draw against Leeds was regarded as a marquee tie for Cardiff and the idea of hosting the fixture at the nearby Millennium Stadium was put forward and the ground was made available if needed by Welsh Rugby Union chairman Glanmor Griffiths. Nevertheless, Hammam declared that promotion from the Second Division remained his priority and that the Leeds match was \"the least important\". The Football Association rejected the idea of moving the fixture, insisting \"there was no compelling reason to move the tie.\"", "Cardiff were forced into one change for the match. Dean Gordon had returned to his parent club Middlesbrough at the end of his loan spell. In his place, Cork selected 35-year old Andy Legg. Apart from Gordon, Cork made one further change from the club's previous fixture, a 3\u20131 defeat to Bristol City on 29 December 2001. Jason Bowen was dropped to the substitutes bench with Paul Brayson starting in his place. The more attacking Bowen was dropped in order for Brayson to provide more defensive support. Leeds made one change to their matchday squad from their previous fixture, a 3\u20130 victory over West Ham United on 1 January, Frazer Richardson replaced Harpal Singh on the bench. Prior to the game, John Charles, who played for both sides during his career, was presented to the crowd and received a standing ovation from fans of both sides.", "|FW ||14|| Paul Brayson"]}, {"page": "Brayson, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Brayson"]}]}}
