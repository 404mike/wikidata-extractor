The special begins in the 1960s, with Nicey presenting Blue Peter and dancing on stage with Freddie and the Dreamers in doctored footage of the band's appearance on the show performing \"You Were Made For Me\", interviewing The Beatles, and becoming a DJ on offshore station \"Radio Geraldine\" where Smashie is initially his teaboy. It combines elements from the careers of several real DJs, with Smashie seen hosting a Saturday night TV show called Smashie's House Party, a parody of Noel's House Party, and having turned his show into a plea for his wife (named specifically as \"Tessa\") to come back after she has left him, repeatedly playing Bobby Goldsboro's \"Honey\" (Tony Blackburn did precisely this in the mid-1970s when his wife, actress Tessa Wyatt, left him). Similarly, Nicey is revealed to have advertised \"Deptford Draylons\", alluding to Alan Freeman's ads for Brentford Nylons, to have interviewed the Sex Pistols (in doctored footage of their famous interview with Bill Grundy) and to have fronted The Dave Nice Video Show, a parody of The Kenny Everett Video Show. The duo are also said to have performed on the Band Aid single \"Do They Know It's Christmas\". Freeman himself makes a cameo appearance, as do Blackburn, David Jensen and John Peel. The programme was repeated on BBC Two in August 2015, however, some material (such as Smashie asking a member of the Top of the Pops audience how old she was) was edited out."]}, {"page": "Richard O'Sullivan", "response": ["When the television series ended in 1976, he continued playing Robin Tripp in the spin-off sitcom Robin's Nest, in which Robin sets up a bistro with funding from his girlfriend Vicky's father James Nicholls (Tony Britton).
