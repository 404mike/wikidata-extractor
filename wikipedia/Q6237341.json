He then served in Jamaica (1818-1827 and 1841\u201344), Ireland (from 1835\u201336, and in 1844), Spain and Gibraltar (1836\u201339), South Africa (1847-51, during the Cape frontier wars) and Bombay (1851\u201354).\nHe was ordered from Bombay straight to the Crimea for the Crimean War in 1854, with the rank of Inspector-General of Hospitals, to head its main receiving hospital at Scutari during that campaign.  In that role he came into contact and conflict with Florence Nightingale (whom he called in his letters a \"petticoat imperieuse\"), though he fully welcomed the help offered by Mary Seacole.  He returned from the Crimea in 1856, and retired a year later.\nThough his actions in the Crimea led to his being mentioned in dispatches, becoming a KCB and officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, and receiving the third class of the Turkish order of the Mejidiye, he also faced criticism for them.  The \u2018Observations on the Report of the Sanitary Commission despatched to the Seat of the War in the East,\u2019 that he published in 1857 brought him into conflict with John Sutherland and Nightingale, since (with one other pamphlet by Hall) they were intended to rebut her criticisms of his organisation of the army hospitals.  Intending to spend his retirement in India writing a medical history of the Crimean campaign, he was left part-paralysed by a stroke and gave up the intended book, touring Europe instead for the remainder of his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Hall", "response": ["John Hall may refer to:", "* John Hall (NYU President) (fl. c. 1890), American academic", "* John Hall (British Army officer) (1795\u20131866), British military surgeon", "* John Hall (Maryland politician) (1729\u20131797), delegate to the Continental Congress", "* John Hall (New York politician) (born 1948), U.S. Representative from New York", "* John Hall (West Virginia politician) (1805\u20131881), Virginia politician and West Virginia founder", "* John Hall (1632\u20131711), British MP for Wells, 1671\u20131679 and 1680\u20131685", "* John Hall (Buckingham MP) (1799\u20131872), British general and MP for Buckingham, 1846\u20131859", "* John Hall (Labour politician) (1896\u20131955), MP for Gateshead West, 1950\u20131955", "* John Hall (Wycombe MP) (1911\u20131978)", "* John Hall (New South Wales politician) (1856\u20131921)", "* John Hall (New Zealand politician) (1824\u20131907)", "* John Hall (Victorian politician) (1884\u20131949)", "* John Hall (minister) (c. 1559\u20131627), Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland", "* John Hall (bishop) (1633\u20131710), English churchman and academic", "* John Hall (Presbyterian pastor) (1829\u20131898), Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York City", "* John Hall (Archdeacon of Salop) (born 1941)", "* John Hall (priest) (born 1949), British Anglican Church leader", "* John Hall (Archdeacon of Killaloe) (1626\u20131691), Church of Ireland priest", "* John Hall (physician) (1575\u20131636), William Shakespeare's son-in-law and medical author", "* John Hall (engineer) (1765\u20131836), English engineer and millwright", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1815) (1815\u20131888), English first-class cricketer", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1874) (1874\u20131925), English cricketer", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1903) (1903\u20131979), English cricketer", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1934), English cricketer", "* John Hall (cricketer, born 1950), English cricketer", "* John Hall (1930s footballer), winger who played for Burnley", "* John Hall (footballer, born 1944), Bradford City A.F.C. footballer", "* John Hall (footballer, born 1994), Adelaide United FC footballer", "* John Hall (placekicker) (born 1974), American football kicker", "* John Hall (baseball) (1924\u20131995), for the 1948 Brooklyn Dodgers", "* John Hall (sport shooter) (1906\u20131978), British Olympic shooter", "* John Halle (died 1568), called also John Hall of Maidstone, English surgeon, known as a medical writer and poet", "* John Hall (poet) (1627\u20131656), English poet, essayist and pamphleteer", "* N.

William Simpson, then serving in India, in 1873. Simpson was born in Dublin perhaps 1829 and was thus over 20 years older than Alice. After several previous placements as a minister Simpson applied to serve in India in 1857. Together they served in several locations ultimately in Dagshai, India, in the far north in the border range of mountains before the Himalaya where both daughters were born. This was during the British Raj amidst the period of the Great Famine of 1876\u20131878 which began in regions to the south and west and spread north.

This only succeeded in exacerbating the tension which already existed between Nightingale and BridgemanSisters of Mercy - Brought to Life: Exploring the History of Medicine - Science Museum, London which persisted throughout the rest of the military campaign,Mary C. Sullivan (ed), The Friendship of Florence Nightingale and Mary Clare Moore, University of Pennsylvania Press (1999) - Google Books pg. 56 with peace being brokered by various hospital doctors and chaplains resulting in the Sisters being permitted to continue with their nursing. In several letters Nightingale referred to Bridgeman as 'Mrs. Bridgeman' and 'Reverend Mother Brickbat'.John W. Donohue, 'Sisters in Mercy' - America: the Jesuit Review, - 4 June 2001 ", "However, tensions also existed between Bridgeman and Mother Mary Clare Moore, who had arrived in the first wave of Irish Sisters of Mercy in October 1854. Each of the two had their own agenda, with Moore being anxious to avoid being accused of attempting to convert wounded Protestant soldiers to Catholicism; while Bridgeman could not understand how Moore could allow herself to be under the authority of Nightingale, a secular woman. Bridgeman believed that Nightingale had deliberately driven a wedge between the two groups of Sisters. She did not like or trust Nightingale and was careful to gain the support of Dr. John Hall, who also disliked Nightingale. As war in the Crimea was coming to an end Nightingale visited Bridgeman and her Sisters at the Crimean hospitals at the frontline to invite them join her at Scutari, but they declined to go. In the Crimea the Sisters introduced tried and tested systems of management and nursing details of which were requested by Nightingale. Mother Mary Francis's journal relates that 'Miss N took notes on our manner of nursing which I explained to her as she hoped someone might profit of it'. It has been suggested that the system of management and nursing introduced by Bridgeman and her Sisters in the Crimea found their way uncredited into Nightingale's report to the War Office.Bridgeman, p. 367 "]}]}}
