He also works as the club ambassador and youth team coach for Championship side Swansea City.\nTrundle's career began in the English non-league system, where he played for Burscough, Chorley, Stalybridge Celtic, Southport and Bamber Bridge, before signing for Welsh Premier League side Rhyl. He managed to net 15 goals in 18 matches for Rhyl, and his performances earned him a move to Football League side Wrexham in 2001. Trundle made a name for himself in professional football during a four-year spell for Swansea City, where he scored 78 goals in 146 appearances between 2003 and 2007. In July 2007, he left Swansea and signed with Bristol City, though he only scored 8 times in 3 seasons and was loaned out to both Leeds United and back to Swansea.\nIn 2010, following his release from Bristol City, Trundle returned to the top tier of Welsh football and signed for Neath. He spent two years with the club, scoring 26 goals in 59 matches, but found himself a free agent once more when Neath were liquidated in 2012. In a surprise move, Trundle rejoined the Football League in the summer of 2012 at the age of 35, signing for League One side Preston North End. However, a lengthy injury saw him lose out on a first team position, and he left Preston in February 2013 through a mutual termination of his contract. Stints with non-league clubs Chester and Marine followed before Trundle retired from football at the age of 36. However, in August 2016, he came out of retirement to sign for Welsh Division Two club Llanelli Town, scoring 86 goals in 59 appearances during back-to-back promotions.
