A transport and two escort fighters from the RAE flew to the area to leave the Royal Aircraft Establishment Chief Test Pilot Roland Falk and a flight engineer with the commando group. On 10 September, as Operation Dragoon was wrapping up in the southeast of France, the aircraft was captured and flown back to the UK by Falk. Soon afterwards, Capt. Eric Brown, an RN pilot then posted to the RAE as a test pilot, flew the He 177.Brown 2007, pp. 82\u201384. He wrote that the in-flight handling characteristics of the He 177 A-5 were \"...positive about all axes, but the controls were all remarkably light for such a large aircraft. Indeed I had the feeling that the elevator was dangerously light and I was all too aware of the intelligence reports of He 177s breaking up in the air so I decided to treat this control very gently...The aircraft had an automatic pull-out device and an acceleration warning apparatus fitted, but it really was nailbiting to have to treat a giant like this immense Heinkel bomber as if it were made of glass. The stalling characteristics with flaps and undercarriage lowered, the aircraft buffeted violently at 140 km/h (87 mph) before the nose dropped at 135 km/h (84 mph). The buffet experienced was so violent that I had some concerns over structural damage. Somehow the He 177 always conveyed an impression of fragility despite its size.\"Brown 1993, pp. 31, 34. He added that it was \"one of the very few German aircraft of the period that I tested that I did not enjoy flying\".Brown 2007, p. 82."]}, {"page": "Falk (name)", "response": ["* Roland Falk, (1915\u20131985), British test pilot"]}, {"page": "No. 1426 Flight RAF", "response": ["* Roland Falk"]}, {"page": "Roly Falk", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roland Falk"]}]}}
