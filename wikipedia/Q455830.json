One of Nora's relatives sent them a small sum to cover the first few months. Pound and Yeats worked with the British government to provide a stipend from the Royal Literary Fund in 1915 and a grant from the British civil list the following year. Eventually, Joyce received large regular sums from the editor Harriet Shaw Weaver, who operated The Egoist, and the psychotherapist Edith Rockefeller McCormick, who lived in Z\u00fcrich studying under Carl Jung. Weaver financially supported Joyce throughout the entirety of his life and even paid for his funeral. Between 1917 and the beginning of 1919, Joyce was financially secure and lived quite well; the family sometimes stayed in Locarno in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland. But health problems remained a constant issue. During their time in Z\u00fcrich, both Joyce and Nora suffered illnesses that were diagnosed as \"nervous breakdowns\" and he had to undergo many eye surgeries."]}, {"page": "October 14", "response": ["*  1961   \u2013 Harriet Shaw Weaver, English journalist and activist (b. 1876)"]}, {"page": "September 1", "response": ["*1876 \u2013 Harriet Shaw Weaver, English journalist and activist (d. 1961)"]}, {"page": "1961", "response": ["** Harriet Shaw Weaver, English political activist (b. 1876)"]}, {"page": "1876", "response": ["* September 1 \u2013 Harriet Shaw Weaver, English political activist (d. 1961)"]}, {"page": "Ezra Pound", "response": ["In his reply to Pound, Joyce gave permission to use \"I hear an Army\" and enclosed Dubliners and the first chapter of his novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.

In a letter to his Maecenas, Harriet Shaw Weaver (March 1924), Joyce made a list of these sigla.

H. Hutton as \"unequalled for grandeur of outline, purity of taste and radiance of total effect\"; while his latest and longest, The Dream of Gerontius, attempts to represent the unseen world along the same lines as Dante. His prose style, especially in his Catholic days, is fresh and vigorous, and is attractive to many who do not sympathise with his conclusions, from the apparent candour with which difficulties are admitted and grappled; while in his private correspondence there is charm. James Joyce had a lifelong admiration for Newman's writing style and in a letter to his patron Harriet Shaw Weaver remarked about Newman that \"nobody has ever written English prose that can be compared with that of a tiresome footling little Anglican parson who afterwards became a prince of the only true church\"."]}, {"page": "Frodsham", "response": ["* Harriet Shaw Weaver (1876\u20131961), feminist political activist and patron of James Joyce, was born in Frodsham.Cottam, Rachel (2004) 'Weaver, Harriet Shaw (1876\u20131961), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press,  Retrieved on 9 March 2007"]}, {"page": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man", "response": ["A Portrait won Joyce a reputation for his literary skills, as well as a patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, the business manager of The Egoist."]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1875\u20131939||data-sort-value=\"Weaver, Harriet Shaw\"|Harriet Shaw Weaver||United Kingdom||1860||1932||Suffragette||"]}, {"page": "Tweedledum and Tweedledee", "response": ["* In a 1921 letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver, the writer James Joyce uses the twins \"Tweedledum and Tweedledee\" to characterize Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung and their conflict.James Joyce: Letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver. 24 June 1921"]}, {"page": "Women's Social and Political Union", "response": ["* Harriet Shaw Weaver"]}, {"page": "Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)", "response": ["Irvine was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, one of six children of historian William Fergusson Irvine (1869\u20131962) and Lilian Davies-Colley (1870\u20131950).Summers, p. xiii His father's family had Scottish and Welsh roots, while his mother was from an old Cheshire family.
