The British rabbi Simcha Weinstein notes that Superman's story has some parallels to that of Moses.  For example, Moses as a baby was sent away by his parents in a reed basket to escape death and adopted by a foreign culture. Weinstein also posits that Superman's Kryptonian name, \"Kal-El\", resembles the Hebrew words \u05e7\u05dc-\u05d0\u05dc, which can be taken to mean \"voice of God\". The historian Larry Tye suggests that this \"Voice of God\" is an allusion to Moses' role as a prophet. The suffix \"el\", meaning \"(of) God\", is also found in the name of angels (e.g. Gabriel, Ariel), who are airborne humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers. The Nazis also thought Superman was a Jew and in 1940 Joseph Goebbels publicly denounced Superman and his creator Jerry Siegel."]}, {"page": "Crown Heights, Brooklyn", "response": ["* Simcha Weinstein (born 1975), author and rabbi"]}, {"page": "Superman (1978 film)", "response": ["The Christian imagery in the Reeve films has provoked comment on the Jewish origins of Superman. Rabbi Simcha Weinstein's book Up, Up and Oy Vey: How Jewish History, Culture and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero, says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a \"nebbish\", saying \"He's a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He's Woody Allen.\" Ironically, it is also in the Reeve films that Clark Kent's persona has the greatest resemblance to Woody Allen, though his conscious model was Cary Grant's character in Bringing Up Baby. This same theme is pursued about 1940s superheroes generally in Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero by Danny Fingeroth."]}, {"page": "Jewish humor", "response": ["*Simcha Weinstein (2008).
