As a footballer he was a forward and winger from 1998 to 2011. Prior to his football career, he was a promising young tennis player, ranking among the top 20 players in Britain.\nBorn in Sheffield, England, Boulding excelled at both football and tennis, but chose to adopt the latter after he was spotted by coach Tony Pickard, who trained Boulding for 10 years. However, having continued to train as a footballer and play in the non-league with Hallam, he finished his tennis career in 1999, when he turned a professional footballer with Mansfield Town. He played for two years in Division Three with Mansfield, before he moved up two divisions to Grimsby Town. After scoring 11 goals in a season with Grimsby, he attracted interest from Premier League-side Aston Villa. However, his stay with Villa was short-lived and his only first team action was in the Intertoto Cup, before he returned to Grimsby. He spent another two years with Grimsby and then another two with Barnsley, before he decided to retire in 2005.\nBoulding worked in the family business but returned to football in March 2006, with Rotherham United. He did not play for Rotherham in two months and instead returned to Mansfield Town, along with his brother, Rory, at the end of the season. Boulding scored just six goals in his first season with Mansfield. However, after he scored 25 in his second season, when the team were relegated from The Football League, he attracted interest from a number of League One and Two clubs. He eventually decided to join Bradford City, again with his brother, but the pair were released early from their contracts after less than two years with the club. The brothers were given trials back at Mansfield Town, but while Rory joined Accrington Stanley, Michael returned to Barnsley on short-term deal and later had a similar contract at Derby County but never featured in either first team. He has also been involved with running the family's property business.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hallam F.C.", "response": ["*  Michael Boulding"]}, {"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["|  Phil Jevons and  Michael Boulding || 12 || 2003\u201304", "|  Michael Boulding || 11 || 2001\u201302", "* Michael Boulding"]}, {"page": "Kevin Muscat", "response": ["In March 2002, Muscat was sent off after nine minutes in a match against Grimsby Town for elbowing Grimsby striker Michael Boulding.

During the 2002\u201303 season, Town manager Paul Groves had been dealt several blows by the loss of loanee Steve Kabba as well as injuries to other forwards such as Michael Boulding while Phil Jevons was loaned out for financial reasons, this in turn saw Groves forced to select inexperienced youngsters such as Mansaram and David Soames. Despite impressing in the final half of the season, Mansaram was powerless in helping Grimsby avoid relegation from the First Division, however by the end of the season his performances had meant he was now considered as a first team regular. During the summer months he drew interest from Sheffield Wednesday but no concrete offer came in and the young striker nicknamed 'Flash' due to his lightning pace up front, stayed on at Blundell Park. Paul Groves eventually lost his job in February 2004 and was replaced by Nicky Law who in turn chopped and changed the Grimsby squad meaning signings such as Isaiah Rankin meant that Mansaram by the end of that season had found himself only playing a cameo role within the first team. Following a second successive relegation the Grimsby board installed another new manager in Russell Slade, and Mansaram now out of contract was kept on at the club during pre-season on a trial basis but despite being initially told he wasn't going to be offered a new deal he eventually signed on a 6-month deal.

Michael Boulding opened the scoring with his first City goal before Thorne added his fifth of the campaign. McCall stated he wanted to sign one more player before the August transfer deadline, before bringing in South African midfielder Dean Furman from his former side Rangers on loan until January. City's winning start to the league season came to an end with a defeat by Aldershot Town\u2014the first time the two sides had met. City had taken the lead with Paul McLaren's first goal for the club, but Peter Thorne missed a penalty as City lost 3\u20132.", "City suffered a second successive defeat when they were knocked out of another cup by a rival West Yorkshire side from League One.

The game marked the first contest between managers Stuart McCall and Lee Sinnott since McCall was appointed City manager in May 2007, when Sinnott was also in line for the job following his form at Farsley Celtic. Thorne scored another two, as did Michael Boulding, when City added their fifth win from six league games with a 4\u20131 victory over Exeter City (despite being 1\u20130 behind at half-time) to go top of the league. City lost their unbeaten home start to the season the following week when they lost 3\u20131 to Bournemouth, managed by former City player Jimmy Quinn. Joe Colbeck scored City's goal, his first of the season. City suffered a second successive defeat a week later against another promotion favourite, Shrewsbury Town, 2\u20130.

City recorded their first victory in four games by defeating Accrington Stanley on 11 October, despite trailing by two goals with ten minutes to go. Goals by Conlon, Michael Boulding and Thorne gave City a 3\u20132 victory. The roles were reversed a week later when City led Gillingham 2\u20130 at half-time with goals from Thorne and Colbeck; but, despite Gillingham being reduced to ten men when Mark Bentley was sent off, the game finished 2\u20132. Only two days later, City again fell to a late goal when they lost to Darlington 2\u20131, with Omar Daley scoring his first goal of the season. After recording just one victory in six matches, McCall said he wanted to bring in some loan transfers and signed Tom Clarke from Huddersfield on 23 October. He made his debut the following day as a first-half substitute against Grimsby Town after fellow defender Matthew Clarke was sent off. City were leading 1\u20130 at the time through an Omar Daley, and, despite being reduced to ten men, extended their advantage through former Grimsby striker Michael Boulding and a first club goal for Graeme Lee, eventually winning 3\u20131. Colbeck was injured during the victory over Grimsby, and so McCall signed midfielder Nicky Law, who had played ten games for City the previous season, as cover on another loan deal. The month ended with a 1\u20130 against fellow promotion hopefuls Bury, with Barry Conlon again coming on as substitute to score the only goal of the game.", "At the start of November, City extended their unbeaten run to three games, but were unable to defeat Barnet despite being ahead three times.

Full back Luke O'Brien scored his first senior goal in City's next league game as City defeated Rotherham United 2\u20130 in their first game at the Don Valley Stadium, Rotherham's temporary home. Nicky Law's first goal of his second spell completed the scoring. A second half penalty from Conlon three days later against Chesterfield gave City back-to-back victories and their second 3\u20132 of the season after being 2\u20130 down. First half goals from Graeme Lee and Michael Boulding had started the comeback in the first half before Chesterfield were reduced to ten men when Alan Goodall was sent off for committing the foul which led to Conlon's penalty. Winger Omar Daley was injured in the game, becoming the latest midfielder to be sidelined. As a result, McCall brought into another loan transfer two days later by signing Steve Jones from Burnley for one month. Jones made his debut the following weekend as City lost 2\u20131 in the FA Cup second round to League One's Leyton Orient.", "At the start of December, Chilean striker Willy Topp was released from his contract six months early to let him find a new club.
