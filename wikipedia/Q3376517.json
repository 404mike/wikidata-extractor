Many former Inverness CT players have also \"crossed the bridge\" in the opposite direction, most notably Grant Munro, Michael Fraser,  Ross Tokely and Coll Donaldson in recent years. Both Stuart Golabek and Andy Barrowman had two spells at County each, with the former also having two spells at ICT.
