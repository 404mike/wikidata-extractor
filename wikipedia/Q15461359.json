In recognition of the occasion, Manchester United's official website ran a feature in which a memorable moment from the stadium's history was highlighted on each of the 100 days leading up to the anniversary. From these 100 moments, the top 10 were chosen by a panel including club statistician Cliff Butler, journalist David Meek, and former players Pat Crerand and Wilf McGuinness. At Old Trafford itself, an art competition was run for pupils from three local schools to create their own depictions of the stadium in the past, present and future. Winning paintings were put on permanent display on the concourse of the Old Trafford family stand, and the winners were presented with awards by artist Harold Riley on 22 February. An exhibition about the stadium at the club museum was opened by former goalkeeper Jack Crompton and chief executive David Gill on 19 February. The exhibition highlighted the history of the stadium and features memorabilia from its past, including a programme from the inaugural match and a 1:220 scale model hand-built by model artist Peter Oldfield-Edwards. Finally, at Manchester United's home match against Fulham on 14 March, fans at the game received a replica copy of the programme from the first Old Trafford match, and half-time saw relatives of the players who took part in the first game \u2013 as well as those of the club chairman John Henry Davies and stadium architect Archibald Leitch \u2013 taking part in the burial of a time capsule of Manchester United memorabilia near the centre tunnel.

The match, named \"The Louis Rocca Trophy\", was conceived by Salford-based artist Harold Riley, who had himself been a player for Salford Boys and a discovery of Rocca's for Manchester United, and Manchester-based restaurateur Bruno Cabrelli. Rocca was chosen as the inspiration for the match because, according to Riley, \"one person never mentioned when people talk about United's history is Louis Rocca\". Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson convinced Nike to provide both teams with kits for the occasion.

When Portrait of Ann was included as part of Manchester City Art Gallery's Lowry retrospective in 1959, however, the exhibition catalogue listed the work as being \"lent by the sitter\" (named on the index of lenders as a 'Miss Ann Helder') although, unlike the other works included at the exhibition, no correspondence appears to exist between the curatorial team and the owner."]}, {"page": "Salford Music Festival", "response": ["In 2012, has over 200 bands playing in 18 venues all within the City of Salford.
