He is most known for having been the tour manager of English rock band Led Zeppelin from 1968 to 1980.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Led Zeppelin", "response": ["The band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, still billed as the New Yardbirds; they played their first show as Led Zeppelin at the University of Surrey in Battersea on 25 October. Tour manager Richard Cole, who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their first North American tour at the end of the year. Their debut album, Led Zeppelin, was released in the US during the tour on 12 January 1969 and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard chart; it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March. According to Steve Erlewine, the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, psychedelic blues, groovy, bluesy shuffles and hints of English folk music made it \"a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal\"."]}, {"page": "The Who", "response": ["The transition to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did not sit well with Daltrey, and a recording session of R&B covers went unreleased. The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the West End of London. The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's amphetamines down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked, but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted Richard Cole as a roadie."]}, {"page": "The Song Remains the Same (film)", "response": ["* Richard Cole"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Page", "response": ["In 1975, Page began to use heroin, according to Richard Cole.  Cole claims that he and Page took the drug during the recording sessions of the album Presence, and Page admitted shortly afterward that he was addicted to the drug."]}, {"page": "John Bindon", "response": ["In early 1977, Bindon was hired by Peter Grant on advice from tour manager Richard Cole as security coordinator for the rock group Led Zeppelin during their concert tour of the United States. He had previously provided security for actors Ryan and Tatum O'Neal (he had appeared in Barry Lyndon in a scene with Ryan). An incident involving Bindon occurred at the band's concert at the Oakland Coliseum on 23 July 1977, near the end of their US tour. Upon arrival at the stadium, it is alleged that Bindon pushed a member of promoter Bill Graham's stage crew out of the way as the band entered via a backstage ramp. As a result, tension had been simmering between Graham's staff and Led Zeppelin's security team during the day, and as Grant and Bindon were walking down the ramp near the end of the concert, words were exchanged with stage crew chief Jim Downey, which resulted in Bindon knocking Downey out cold. Bindon maintained that he was goaded into the fight after Graham's crew referred to him as \"a weak limey fuck\".Turner, Lloyd (29 December 1979) \"Bindon aiming for return to acting\", The Daily Star, p. 23"]}, {"page": "Peter Grant (music manager)", "response": ["In 1977, Grant gave his approval for Led Zeppelin's tour manager Richard Cole to hire John Bindon to act as security co-ordinator for the band's concert tour of the United States.

It portrays a peek-behind-the-curtain of the life of a rock band on the road as narrated by Frank Zappa, and contains many thematic elements that, because of time and budget constraints, couldn't be included in the similar movie 200 Motels. The most famous part of the album is \"The Mud Shark\", a telling of a story told to Mother Don Preston by some members of Vanilla Fudge about a hotel, Seattle's Edgewater Inn, where guests could fish from their rooms. In the tale, a mud shark is caught by one of the members of Vanilla Fudge or its crew and, when combined with a groupie and a movie camera, depravity ensues. Although not stated in \"The Mud Shark,\" this 1969 incident, now referred to as \"the Shark episode,\" also involved Led Zeppelin's drummer John Bonham and road manager Richard Cole, with Vanilla Fudge's singer/keyboardist Mark Stein operating the movie camera."]}, {"page": "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You", "response": ["Guitarist Jimmy Page heard Baez' version and began developing \"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\" early in his career as a session guitarist. He played the song for singer Robert Plant during their first meeting at Page's riverside home at Pangbourne in late July 1968. In his book Stairway to Heaven, Zeppelin tour manager Richard Cole claims that the arrangement evolved when Plant played Page the guitar part that eventually appeared on the album; however, this has been refuted by Page.Brad Tolinski and Greg Di Bendetto, \"Light and Shade\", Guitar World, January 1998. In an interview, Page commented, \"I used to do the song in the days of sitting in the darkness playing my six-string behind Marianne Faithfull.\" "]}]}}
