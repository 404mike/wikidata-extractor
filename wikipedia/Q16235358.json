Although he briefly switched to touring car racing in 1996, competing in the Super Tourenwagen Cup, and entered the MGF Cup in 1999, winning the series, he did not switch away from single-seater racing fully until 2001, when, having been signed by MG, he entered both the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the BTCC. He competed in both competitions the following year, and remained in the BTCC in 2003; however, he did not have much success in either competition, and left MG at the end of 2003, after they ended their motorsport programme. In 2004, he entered part of the British GT Championship, the Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain, the FIA GT Championship and the Le Mans Series, and entered various events of the latter series up until 2012. During that time, he also competed in events that were part of various other series, notably the American Le Mans Series (in 2005 and 2012) and the FIA GT1 World Championship (in 2010 and 2011). Having won the SPEED EuroSeries in 2011, he became a regular driver in the British GT Championship in 2012 (in addition to entering in events that were part of the FIA World Endurance Championship), and he won the GT4 category that season, driving with Jody Fannin in a Team WFR-entered Ginetta G50.", "For 2012, Hughes signed for Murphy Prototypes, driving their Oreca 03-Nissan alongside Firth and Brendon Hartley in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and Firth in the European Le Mans Series. His ELMS debut came at the 6 Hours of Castellet, but it would not be a successful one, with the car catching fire during the event. Once more in the Le Mans event, however, mechanical maladies struck, with suspension failure after 196 laps forcing the team to retire from a strong position. A podium at the 6 Hours of Donington, however, would prove to be the team's only point-scoring finish of the season, as the team once more failed to finish at the Petit Le Mans, following an electronics failure after 330 laps. In addition to his ELMS and 24 Hours of Le Mans entries, Hughes returned to the British GT Championship with Team WFR in the Ginetta G50 GT4, being partnered by Jody Fannin. The pairing dominated the GT4 category, winning eight of their ten races on the way to the title, and finishing 84.25 points ahead of nearest rival Zo\u00eb Wenham."]}, {"page": "British GT Championship", "response": ["| Jody Fannin   Warren Hughes "]}, {"page": "2010 Ginetta Junior Championship", "response": ["Hillspeed's Tom Ingram became champion after a strong run towards the end of the season which included weekend sweeps at Silverstone and Knockhill, as well as a season-opening victory at Thruxton. Ingram's success, which included eight other podium finishes to go with his five wins, came despite having one of the smallest budgets of all the grid. Ingram's championship-winning margin was 65 points over Tollbar driver Jake Hill, who won ten races but championship aspirations were thwarted by a disqualification at the Brands Hatch GP meeting, and accidents at Silverstone and Brands Hatch Indy. TJ Motorsport's Louise Richardson finished third with a pair of victories at Snetterton and Brands Hatch Indy, along with ten other podium finishes including a run of eight successive podium finishes during the middle part of the season. Her team-mate Jody Fannin got the better of Tom Howard, who was a TJ driver until mid-season when he joined Hill at Tollbar, for fourth and fifth places; Fannin took victories at Brands Hatch GP and Croft, while Howard took the other victory at Rockingham.
