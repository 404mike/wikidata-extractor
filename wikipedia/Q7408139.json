He made his first-team debut on 16 September 1908, when he replaced Sam Shearer at inside-left against Crystal Palace. Although less skillful than Shearer, Jordan was a more \"thrustful\" player, more suited to Southern League football, and by December he had become the regular inside-left. Described as \"fleet of foot and an agile dribbler\", Jordan scored four goals from his 25 league appearances in 1908\u201309."]}]}}
