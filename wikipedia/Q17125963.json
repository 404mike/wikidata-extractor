He also edited C.G. Jung Letters, with Aniela Jaffe. With his wife Hella, he was a founding member of the Society of Analytical Psychology in London, of which C.G. Jung was first President. Despite their years long collaboration on translating and editing, Adler's allegiance to Jung and the \"Zurich school\" caused irreconcilable differences with Michael Fordham, and led to his leaving the Society of Analytical Psychology, and founding the Association of Jungian Analysts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carl Jung", "response": ["The Collected Works of C.

Prominent advocates of this approach, according to Samuels (1985), include Emma Jung, Jung's wife, an analyst in her own right, Marie-Louise von Franz, Joseph L. Henderson, Aniela Jaff\u00e9, Erich Neumann, Gerhard Adler and Jolande Jacobi. Jung credited Neumann, author of \"Origins of Conscious\" and \"Origins of the Child\", as his principal student to advance his (Jung's) theory into a mythology-based approach. He is associated with developing the symbolism and archetypal significance of several myths: the Child, Creation, the Hero, the Great Mother and Transcendence.", "One archetypal approach, sometimes called \"the imaginal school\" by James Hillman, was written about by him in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Its adherents, according to Samuels (1985), include Gerhard Adler, Irene Claremont de Castillejo, Adolf Guggenb\u00fchl-Craig, Murray Stein,  and Wolfgang Giegerich. Thomas Moore also was influenced by some of Hillman's work. Developed independently, other psychoanalysts have created strong approaches to archetypal psychology. Mythopoeticists and psychoanalysts such as Clarissa Pinkola Est\u00e9s who believes that ethnic and aboriginal people are the originators of archetypal psychology and have long carried the maps for the journey of the soul in their songs, tales, dream-telling, art and rituals; Marion Woodman who proposes a feminist viewpoint regarding archetypal psychology. Some of the mythopoetic/archetypal psychology creators either imagine the Self not to be the main archetype of the collective unconscious as Jung thought, but rather assign each archetype equal value. Others, who are modern progenitors of archetypal psychology (such as Est\u00e9s), think of the Self as the thing that contains and yet is suffused by all other archetypes, each giving life to the other."]}, {"page": "December 1988", "response": ["** Gerhard Adler, German analytical psychologist (b. 1904) This source gives Adler's date of death as 23 December 1988."]}, {"page": "The Collected Works of C.

Among the members was a young medical friend and analysand of Baynes, Michael Fordham. Meanwhile the lay analysts convened their own group in the Club. With the influx during the 1930s of Jewish analysts of all stripes fleeing from Nazi Germany, the Jungians increased to twelve analysts. Meanwhile the Club's Medical Society formulated training standards with Jung's approval. These were then presented to the Medical Section of the British Psychological Society in 1939. The Second world war brought about a hiatus in activity. In 1944 Fordham proposed a Centre for Analytical Psychology. However, in 1943 the British Medical Association had begun to lay down guidelines for treatment, including for mental health in preparation for the eventual demobilisation of medical staff. Added to this, analysts from the British Psychoanalytical Society (founded in 1919) also congregated in the medical section of the British Psychological Society where a rapprochement began between Freudians and Jungians. There were meetings between Kleinians, Middle Group Freudians and Jungians in the 1940s all of which helped to crystallise an impetus for the latter to establish themselves in the Psychotherapy field. Differences between medical and lay analysts were put aside provided the medical analysts (mostly men) supervised the lay analysts (mostly women), and a new society came into being in November 1945. The founders of the SAP were Gerhard Adler, Hella Adler, Dr. C.M. Barker, Frieda and Michael Fordham, Philip Metman, Robert Moody and Lotte Paulsen.", "The fact that Michael Fordham, the first director of training, was a child psychiatrist of a high intellectual calibre and on close professional terms with colleagues such as Donald Winnicott and Wilfred Bion along with other representatives of the Object Relations School, set the theoretical direction of the course to include a focus on (Kleinian) child development in a manner that had it tagged as the 'London School' or the 'developmental school'. revised as Children as Individuals, 1969. Analysts loyal to the Zurich approach found this to be a deviation from 'classical' (archetypal) Jungian teaching and tensions rose in the organisation. The first to resign was E.A. Bennet in 1963, followed by a major split in 1976 when Gerhard Adler and several other members left to form a separate training body, the Association of Jungian Analysts, AJA, which itself was to split later on. Thomas Kirsch has interpreted the divisions of that era within the SAP as the playing out of the differences between the rationalist philosophical bent of continental Europe, Jung was heavily influenced by Kant, and British Empiricism.
