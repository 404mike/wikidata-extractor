With much of the economy now nationalised, Jenkins argued, socialists should concentrate on eliminating the remaining pockets of poverty and on the removal of class barriers, as well as promoting libertarian social reforms.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, pp. 181\u2013182. Jenkins was principal sponsor, in 1959, of the bill which became the liberalising Obscene Publications Act, responsible for establishing the \"liable to deprave and corrupt\" criterion as a basis for a prosecution of suspect material and for specifying literary merit as a possible defence.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, pp. 182\u2013186."]}, {"page": "Hugh Gaitskell", "response": ["He attended New College, Oxford, from 1924 to 1927. Studying under G. D. H. Cole, Gaitskell became a socialist and wrote a long essay on Chartism, arguing that the working class needed middle class leadership. Gaitskell's first political involvement came about as a result of the General Strike of 1926. Most students supported the government and many volunteered for civil defence duties, or helped to run essential services. Gaitskell, unusually, supported the strikers and acted as a driver for people like his Oxford contemporary Evan Durbin and Cole's wife Margaret, who made speeches and delivered the trade union newspaper British Worker. After the collapse of the General Strike, Gaitskell spent another six months raising funds for the miners, whose dispute (technically a lockout rather than a strike) did not end until November.Williams 1985, p18-19 He graduated with a first-class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1927.", "In 1927\u201328 Gaitskell lectured in economics for the Workers' Educational Association to miners in Nottinghamshire. His essay on Chartism was published as a WEA booklet in 1928. This was his first experience of interaction with the working class.Campbell 2010, p198 Gaitskell eventually came to oppose both Cole's Guild Socialism and Syndicalism and to feel that the General Strike had been the last failed spasm of a strategy - attempting to seize power through direct trade union action - which had already been tried in the abortive Triple Alliance Strike of 1921. It is unclear whether Gaitskell was ever sympathetic to Oswald Mosley, then seen as a future leader of the Labour Party. Gaitskell's wife later insisted that he never had been, but Margaret Cole, Evan Durbin's wife and Noel Hall believed that he was, although as an opponent of factional splits he was not tempted to join Mosley's New Party in 1931.Williams 1985, p43", "Gaitskell helped to run the New Fabian Research Bureau, set up by G. D. H. Cole in March 1931. He was selected as Labour candidate for Chatham in autumn 1932. Gaitskell moved to University College London in the early 1930s at the invitation of Noel Hall. In 1934 he joined the XYZ Club, a club for Labour financial experts (e.g. Hugh Dalton, of whom he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Douglas Jay and Evan Durbin) and City people such as the economist Nicholas Davenport. Dalton and Gaitskell were often referred to as \"Big Hugh and Little Hugh\" over the next fifteen years.Williams 1985, p70", "By the mid-1930s Gaitskell had formed a close relationship with a married woman, Mrs. Dora Frost (n\u00e9e Creditor), who came out to join him in Vienna for the latter part of his stay there. Adultery still carried such stigma that she thought it best not to help him during his Parliamentary campaign in Chatham in 1935. After her divorce, hard to obtain prior to the passage of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937, they were eventually married on 9 April 1937, Gaitskell's thirty-first birthday, with Evan Durbin as best man.Williams 1985, p79 Dora had a son, Raymond Frost (b 1925), from her first marriage.Williams 1985, p37 The Gaitskells had two daughters: Julia, born in 1939 and Cressida, born in 1942. Dora Gaitskell became a Labour life peer one year after her husband's death, and died in 1989.William Rodgers: Gaitskell, (Anna) Dora, Baroness Gaitskell (1901\u20131989) rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 17 March 2013", "Brivati writes that for Gaitskell \"socialism was not an end state \u2026 but the reform of institutions and practices for the more effective realisation of preferred values\". Evan Durbin's Politics of Democratic Socialism (1940) was a seminal text. Gaitskell was not, in Brivati's view, a \"progressive\" in any modern sense. He favoured equality and thought the free market wasteful. He wanted to incorporate Liberal opinion within the Labour vote. However, the modernising leaders of subsequent generations, Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair, were to a certain extent continuing Gaitskell's tradition."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Evan Durbin"]}, {"page": "Douglas Jay", "response": ["Alongside Evan Durbin and Hugh Gaitskell, he brought the thinking of John Maynard Keynes to the Labour Party, especially in relation to price determination.
