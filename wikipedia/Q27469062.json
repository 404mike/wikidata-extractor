The acting style changed throughout the play, which began with abstraction, as the actors faced front, saying their lines without gestures, accents or actions. They then moved through more dimensional performances to full realism in the second half. Crouch described this as \"a tide of realism, this play \u2013 it begins low tide and it goes full high tide, in story and form.\"Holly Williams, 'Adler & Gibb: Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?', The Independent, 24 June 2014 Naturalism was further undercut by the presence of two children on stage, building an earth barrow and introducing absurd props. Crouch explained, \"It's a pricking of that absurd structure that we've built around us in terms of representation: kids are just so free from that. The child actor \u2013 a child, pretending to be another child \u2013 is kind of stupid.
