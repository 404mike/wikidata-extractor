He was born in Middlesbrough, then in Yorkshire.\nGreensmith played as an all-rounder: a right-handed batsman usually batting in the lower middle order, and a right-arm leg-spin and googly bowler. Without ever hitting the heights \u2013 he never scored 1000 runs in a season and nor did he ever take 100 wickets \u2013 he was an integral part of the Essex team from the start of the 1951 season through to 1963, when he was replaced in some games by Robin Hobbs and retired at the end of the season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Bill Greensmith 56"]}, {"page": "Dennis Shaw (cricketer)", "response": ["Shaw made a single first-class appearance for Warwickshire against the Combined Services in 1949 at Edgbaston.  Warwickshire won the toss and elected to bat, making 368/9 declared in their first-innings, with Shaw making 17 runs before he was dismissed by Robert Wilson.  The Combined Services responded in their first-innings with 284 all out, with Shaw taking the wickets of Bill Greensmith and John Deighton to finish the innings with figures of 2/60 from 20 overs.  In their second-innings, Shaw wasn't required to bat, with Warwickshire declaring their innings on 216/5.  The Combined Services narrowly avoided defeat, reaching 192/9 in their second-innings, before the match was declared a draw.  Shaw bowled 14 wicketless overs for the cost of 46 runs in the innings.  This was his only major appearance for Warwickshire."]}, {"page": "Edward Highton", "response": ["Highton made his debut for the Lancashire Second XI against the Warwickshire Second XI in the 1949 Minor Counties Championship. He made 27 further appearances for the Lancashire Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against Cheshire in 1952. Playing minor counties cricket for the Lancashire Second XI allowed him to be selected for a combined Minor Counties cricket team in 1950, making his first-class debut for the team against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1950. Batting first, the Marylebone Cricket Club were dismissed for 127, with Highton taking the wickets of Maurice Crouch and Adam Powell to finish with figures of 2/26 from thirteen overs. The Minor Counties were then dismissed for 172, with Highton scoring 2 runs before he was dismissed by Fred Titmus. Responding in their second-innings, the Marylebone Cricket Club made 229 all out, with Highton taking figures of 4/87 from 25 overs. Chasing 185 for victory, the Minor Counties were dismissed for 129, with Highton last man out when he was dismissed by Francis Appleyard. The following season, he made his only first-class appearance for Lancashire against Essex at Castle Park Cricket Ground, Colchester, in the County Championship. Essex won the toss and elected to bat first, making 384/8 declared in their first-innings, with Highton taking a single wicket, that of Sonny Avery to finish with figures of 1/49 from ten overs. Lancashire were then dismissed for 286 in their second-innings, with Highton scoring 6 runs before he was dismissed by Bill Greensmith. Essex then reached 40/2 declared in their second-innings, at which point the match was declared a draw."]}, {"page": "Dickie Dodds", "response": ["Later, according to his own account, Dodds followed the same precept of asking for God's advice on other matters. He was \"advised\" not to insure against rain in his benefit match, which proved a wise decision. In a match at Ilford, he conceived that if he were to take a catch off a particular ball bowled by leg-spinner Bill Greensmith, he should marry a woman named Ann who was keener on him than he was on her \u2013 Greensmith bowled a long hop, the batsman took a swipe, Dodds held the catch, and married Ann."]}, {"page": "Greensmith", "response": ["* Bill Greensmith (born 1930), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Bill Greensmith (1957\u20131960) : W.
