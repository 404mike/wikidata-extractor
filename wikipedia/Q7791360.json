The writer Thomas Johnson Westropp referred to it in 1905 as Moher U\u00ed Ruis or Moher U\u00ed Ruidhin. The fort still stood in 1780 and is mentioned in an account from John Lloyd's A Short Tour Of Clare (1780).

Tadhg O'Keefe has stressed that there remain issues over the use of terms halls, 'hall-houses', and 'tower-houses' have become needlessly entangled and argues for a clearer understanding of the terms, and where they apply. While archaeologist Thomas Johnson Westropp preferred the term 'peel houses' for these type of fortified residences, the term 'tower house' became more widely used from the early 20th century, with the work and publications of architect and antiquarian Harold Graham Leask.", "They were built by both the Anglo-Irish and Gaelic Irish, with some constructed by English and Scottish immigrants during successive conquests of Ireland between the 1570s and 1690s. Many were positioned within sight of each other and a system of visual communication is said to have been established between them, based on line of sight from the uppermost levels, although this may simply be a result of their high density. County Kilkenny has several examples of this arrangement such as Ballyshawnmore and Neigham. County Clare is known to have had approximately two hundred and thirty tower houses in the 17th century, some of which were later surveyed by the Irish antiquarian Thomas Johnson Westropp in the 1890s."]}, {"page": "Clare Abbey", "response": ["The name, Kimony, mentioned in early medieval documents, (\"the church on the bog\"), suggests that Clare  Abbey was built on the site of an earlier church. The only remains of an older structure are possibly the bullaun in a block of granite and a stone carving over one of the abbey's windows. The monastery was built on a strip of land extending out in the Fergus river flood plain. Archaeologist, Thomas Johnson Westropp in 1900, describes the exposed and less than ideal siting of the abbey as being located in a grassland area, surrounded by marshy land prone to flooding by the River Fergus. He suggested that the site was chosen because it was a sacred site, another indication of an earlier church on in the area."]}, {"page": "Thomas J.

A recess in the north wall reportedly served as a tomb like a similar structure in Kilfenora Cathedral. A prominent hood is crowned by a mitred head. A recess in the south wall may have once been a window with two Gothic arches topped by a carved head wearing a flat cap.

The tale of the eviction of Mac Creiche from Inishcealtra, the island with what sounds like a sacred tree, may refer to Christians taking a pagan sanctuary.  The antiquarian Thomas Johnson Westropp says that Mac Creiche's feast day was Garland Sunday, but was actually held on 11 August.  On the sole basis of the date, Mac Creiche has been identified with Saint Mochta of Louth.

It was a low green ridge, not far from the Fergus, and commanding a view across the whole plain of Clare to Burren, Echtge, and Slieve Bernagh; here he built a church, which formed an independent parish of Kilbrecan, down to, at any rate, the fourteenth century. The name is still preserved in two adjoining townlands, but the massive \u201ccyclopean\u201d foundations of the little oratory are now called Carntemple, and the holy well is Tubberdooran.
