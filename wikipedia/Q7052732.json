A November 1963 Art Magazine review by Donald Judd described Whaam! as one of the \"broad and powerful paintings\" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. In his review of the exhibition, The New York Times art critic Brian O'Doherty described Lichtenstein's technique as \"typewriter pointillism\u00a0... that laboriously hammers out such moments as a jet shooting down another jet with a big BLAM\". According to O'Doherty, the result was \"certainly not art, [but] time may make it so\", depending on whether it could be \"rationalized\u00a0... and placed in line for the future to assimilate as history, which it shows every sign of doing.\" The Tate Gallery in London acquired the work in 1966, leading to heated argument amongst their trustees and some vocal members of the public. The purchase was made from art dealer Ileana Sonnabend, whose asking price of \u00a34,665 (\u00a3 in  currency) was reduced by negotiation to \u00a33,940 (\u00a3 in  currency). Some Tate trustees opposed the acquisition, among them sculptor Barbara Hepworth, painter Andrew Forge and the poet and critic Herbert Read. Defending the acquisition, art historian Richard Morphet, then an assistant keeper at the Tate, suggested that the painting addresses several issues and painterly styles at the same time: \"history painting, Baroque extravagance, and the quotidian phenomenon of mass-circulation comic strips.\" The Times in 1967 described the acquisition as a \"very large and spectacular painting\". The Tate's director, Norman Reid, later said that the work aroused more public interest than any of its acquisitions since World War II."]}, {"page": "Tate Britain", "response": ["In 1953, Tate Director, Sir Norman Reid, attempted to have it replaced by Rodin's John the Baptist, and in 1962 again proposed its removal, calling its presence \"positively harmful\".
