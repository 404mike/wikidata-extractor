However, he resigned the post in 1914, as he was in favour of World War I.\nHe became involved in the Shop Stewards' Movement, and was a member of the Clyde Workers' Committee, an organisation that had been formed to campaign against the Munitions Act, which forbade engineers from leaving the works where they were employed.  For publishing an article in The Worker entitled \"Should the workers arm?\", Muir was jailed for twelve months, alongside Willie Gallacher.\nIn 1917, Muir joined the Independent Labour Party, and became close to John Wheatley.  In the 1918 election, he stood for the Labour Party in Glasgow Maryhill, but was unsuccessful.  He won the seat in the 1922 general election.  He lost his seat in the 1924 election, after which he ran the Workers Educational Association until 1930.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glasgow Maryhill (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1922 || John William Muir || Labour  "]}]}}
