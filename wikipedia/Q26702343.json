He was first educated privately by Reverend James Birkett at Ovingham in Northumbria between 1814 and 1819, before attending Durham School from 1819 to 1823, and then Trinity College, Cambridge in 1823. In 1833, he married Isabella Compton, daughter of Anthony Compton of Carham Hall, but they had no children. In accordance with the will of Elizabeth Archer Hinde, from August 1836, he used the additional surname of Hinde.", "He returned to the seat and parliament at a by-election in 1836\u2014caused by Ridley's death\u2014and held the seat until 1847, when he retired from the race in favour of his brother, Richard Hodgson-Huntley."]}, {"page": "Carham Hall", "response": ["Carham Hall is a grade II listed building near Carham in Northumberland, England. The site, on the Scottish border, was previously occupied by a medieval tower house, built as a defence from border reivers.  The Compton family purchased the estate in 1754 and the following year erected the first Carham Hall, a relatively plain building in the Classical style.  The hall passed to the Hodgson family and in 1870 Richard Hodgson-Huntley ordered it be rebuilt on a grander scale, in four bays.  The hall and estate were afterwards owned by the Perkins family, a daughter of which, Nancy, married William Matthew Burrell in 1903.  Nancy Burrell commissioned Scottish architect James Bow Dunn to extend the hall in 1920.  This extension added a further four bays to the western end of the structure, creating a larger, linear building.  The house was later owned by Sir Thomas Straker-Smith.", "A tower house was present on this site in the 13th century and survived until at least 1541.  The tower would have provided a means of defence against the border reivers who operated in this area during this period.  The estate was purchased by the Compton family in 1754 and they erected the first Carham Hall on the site in 1755.  The structure is recorded in an engraving by J. P. Neale, published in 1818.  Neale's engraving shows the structure was in the Classical style, though rather plain.  It consisted of a three-storey central block with small, two-storey wings.  The hall seems to have passed to the Hodgson family by the end of the century.  A resident of the hall, Richard Hodgson, was responsible for designing St Cuthbert's Church in nearby Carham in 1790.", "The estate passed to Richard Hodgson's grandson Richard Hodgson-Huntley, who was member of parliament for Tynemouth and North Shields and, later, for Berwick-upon-Tweed.  He was also a director of the North British Railway and, from 1877, was High Sheriff of Northumberland.  Hodgson-Huntley is thought to have ordered the rebuilding of Carham Hall in 1870, as a mark of his high social status."]}]}}
