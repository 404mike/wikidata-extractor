He is Professor of Law and Bioethics, and a former Head of Law School at Durham University. He is on the editorial board of Medical Law International.\nHe was educated at the University of the Witwatersrand, Pembroke College, Cambridge, and completed his PhD at the University of East Anglia in 1975.\nProfessor Beyleveld is the leading exponent of the moral theory of the late Alan Gewirth and, as such, his work has attracted extensive academic support and criticism. Over a long career he has collaborated with many academics, principally Professor Roger Brownsword, King's College London and Professor Shaun Pattinson, Durham University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Gewirth", "response": ["Gewirth is best known for his ethical rationalism, according to which a supreme moral principle,  the \"Principle of Generic Consistency\" (PGC), is derivable as a requirement of \"agential self-understanding\".Deryck Beyleveld, A Theoretical Framework for Integrating Ethics and Law The principle states that every agent must act in accordance with his or her own and all other agents' generic rights.", "In 1991, the philosopher Deryck Beyleveld published The Dialectical Necessity of Morality, an authoritative reformulation of Gewirth's argument, including a summary of previously published objections and Beyleveld's own rigorous responses to them on Gewirth's behalf. There is no clear consensus among philosophers regarding the soundness of Gewirth's theory. For at least the past 30 years, philosophers have offered numerous objections to the theory but have nearly all been substantively countered by Gewirth and his adherents. The debate over Gewirth's ideas thus continues. In 2016 Routledge published a volume on Gewirth's ethical theory, edited by Swedish philosopher Per Bauhn and containing contributions by fifteen international scholars.Per Bauhn (ed.), Gewirthian Perspectives on Human Rights, New York and Abingdon: Routledge, 2016."]}, {"page": "Durham Law School", "response": ["* Deryck Beyleveld - Former Head of School"]}, {"page": "Reason and Morality", "response": ["Reason and Morality is a 1978 book about ethics by the philosopher Alan Gewirth. The work for which he is best known, it received positive reviews. The work is defended by the legal scholar Deryck Beyleveld in The Dialectical Necessity of Morality (1991).", "Brooks credited Gewirth with providing \"a complex and detailed brief for an individualist, humanist, ethical position\" and presenting \"a logical linkage between the system and legal decision making relevant to law students.\" Singer wrote that the book was \"justly famous\" and a \"masterful treatise\", and that it was praised by the philosopher Henry Babcock Veatch. According to Singer, the book became the focus of an \"immense volume of commentary\", with Gewirth's idea of prudential rights being especially controversial, having received criticism from Singer himself, as well as other authors. He noted that Gewirth had responded to the commentary on his work and that Deryck Beyleveld, in The Dialectical Necessity of Morality (1991), discussed criticisms of it and defended Gewirth's views, though in his opinion Beyleveld was not successful in defending Gewirth's view of prudential rights. He argued that while Reason and Morality was original and brilliant, Gewirth's outlook excluded the possibility of reasonable disagreement about moral issues."]}]}}
