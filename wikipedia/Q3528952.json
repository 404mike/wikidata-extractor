George Brown was born in Cowley, Oxfordshire, the son of Edwin Brown and Sarah Ann (n\u00e9e Casey). As his figures indicate, he was a very versatile cricketer, being useful as batsman, bowler and wicketkeeper. He played first-class cricket for Hampshire between 1908 and 1933. Though he was never their regular keeper, it was in that role that he played for England, with stiffening the batting in mind.Brown was included in a 2005 list of Hampshire cult figures.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Brown", "response": ["George Brown may refer to:", "* George Brown (musician) (born 1949), American drummer for Kool & the Gang", "* George Brown (scholar), American scholar of Anglo-Saxon literature", "* George Brown (financier) (1787\u20131859), American banker and railroad founder", "* George Brown (communist) (1906\u20131937), Irish-born Manchester trade unionist killed in the Spanish Civil War", "* George Brown (union official), American president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes c.1940", "* George Brown (British Army officer) (1790\u20131865), British soldier in the Peninsular War and the Crimean War", "* George Brown (admiral) (1835\u20131913), American admiral", "* George Brown (Canadian politician) (1818\u20131880), Scottish-born Canadian journalist and politician", "* George Brown (Ottawa politician) (born 1959), Canadian politician", "* George Brown, Baron George-Brown (1914\u20131985), British politician, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "* George Brown (lieutenant governor) (1746\u20131836), American lieutenant governor of Rhode Island", "* George Brown (Wisconsin politician) (1830\u20131909), English-born Wisconsin politician", "* George Brown Jr. (1920\u20131999), U.S. Representative from California", "* George Brown (Governor of Bombay) (fl. 1811\u20131812), British Governor of Bombay", "* George Brown (South African politician) (1870\u20131932), Scottish-born South African trade unionist and politician", "* George Brown (Australian politician) (1929\u20132002), Australian politician and Lord Mayor from Darwin, Northern Territory", "* George Brown (judge) (1942\u20132007), Chief Justice of Belize from 1990 to 1998", "* George Brown (bishop of Dunkeld) (c. 1438\u20131515), Scottish churchman", "* George Brown (Benedictine) (died 1628), English Benedictine", "* George Brown (bishop of Liverpool) (1784\u20131856), English Roman Catholic Bishop of Liverpool", "* George Brown (missionary) (1835\u20131917), English missionary to Fiji, Samoa, and New Britain;

The Combined Services played only their second ever first-class match in that same season against the Australians.  Later in the 1920s, the Royal Navy played first-class cricket at the ground for the first time, against the 1927 touring New Zealanders. The first hat trick at the ground was taken by Stuart Boyes in 1925. Hampshire continued to play at the ground throughout the thirties, at a time when following the retirements of George Brown, Phil Mead, Jack Newman and Lord Tennyson Hampshire were a less successful team.  Hampshire played four matches per season there during the thirties, with the exception of 1938 when they played five matches, before returning to four in 1939.
