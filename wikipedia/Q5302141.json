In the late 1930s, he befriended many Scottish Renaissance figures, such as Hugh MacDiarmid and Douglas Young. He was wounded three times while serving in the Royal Corps of Signals during the North African Campaign. MacLean published little after the war, due to his perfectionism. In 1956, he became head teacher at Plockton High School, where he advocated for the use of the Gaelic language in formal education.", "Between 1939 and 1941, he taught at Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh, and in Hawick. During this period, he wrote most of the poetry that would become D\u00e0in do Eimhir, including the epic An Cuilthionn. MacLean cultivated friendships with Scottish Renaissance poets, including MacDiarmid, Robert Garioch, Norman MacCaig, Douglas Young, and George Campbell Hay. MacLean, also a noted historian, published two influential papers on nineteenth-century Gaelic poetry in Transactions of the  in 1938 and 1939, which challenged the Celtic Twilight view of Gaelic literature. MacLean accused the \"Celtic Twilightists\" with \"attributing to Gaelic poetry the very opposite of every quality which it actually has\", at which they only succeeded because they catered to a credulous English-speaking audience. He pointed out that the apparent sentimentality or impotence of the corpus of Clearance poetry may have been an artefact of the fact that landlords would not have preserved poetry critical of them. His use of Gaelic poetry as a potential source material for historical studies was extremely innovative at the time.", "MacLean once said that various Communist figures meant more to him than any poet, writing to Douglas Young in 1941 that \"Lenin, Stalin and Dimitroff now mean more to me than Prometheus and Shelley did in my teens\". Other left-wing figures that inspired MacLean included James Connolly, an Irish trade union leader executed for leading the Easter Rising; John Maclean, Scottish socialist and pacifist; and John Cornford, Julian Bell, and Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, who were killed by the Francoist regime during the Spanish Civil War. Many of these figures were not Gaels, and some critics have noted MacLean's unusual generosity to non-Gaelic people in his work. Perhaps the one uniting theme in his work is MacLean's anti-elitism and focus on social justice.", "In 1940, eight of MacLean's poems were printed in 17 Poems for 6d, along with Scots poems by Robert Garioch. The pamphlet sold better than expected and was reprinted a few weeks later; it received favourable reviews. While MacLean was in North Africa, he left his poetry with Douglas Young, who had promised to help publish it. In November 1943, the poems were published as  (). D\u00e0in do Eimhir was a sequence of sixty numbered poems, with twelve missing; of the other poems, the most significant was the long narrative poem An Cuilthionn. The book marked a sharp break in style and substance of Gaelic poetry from earlier eras. In his poetry, MacLean emphasized the struggle between love and duty, which was personified in the poet's difficulty in choosing between his infatuation with a female figure, Eimhir, and what he sees as his moral obligation to volunteer in the Spanish Civil War.", "Hugh MacDiarmid wrote a letter to MacLean in 1977, a year before his death, stating that he and MacLean were the best Scottish poets of the twentieth century. MacDiarmid and MacLean influenced each other's work and maintained an extensive correspondence which has been published. Douglas Young wrote that \"the best poetry written in our generation in the British Isles has been in Scottish Gaelic, by Sorley MacLean.\" John MacInnes called him a \"magisterial writer\" who \"[pushed] Gaelic to its limits\". He said that it is \"truly astonishing\" that Gaelic, so long minoritized, could have produced a writer like MacLean, who could not express what he had to say in any other language: \"Somhairle MacGill-Eain needed Gaelic, and Gaelic needed Somhairle MacGill-Eain\". According to Iain Crichton Smith, translator of MacLean's poetry, D\u00e0in do Eimhir was \"the greatest Gaelic book of this century\", an assessment with which Christopher Whyte agreed. According to Maoilios Caimbeul, MacLean was the best Scottish Gaelic poet of all time. Smith compared the calibre of MacLean's love poetry to that of Catallus and William Butler Yeats. Nobel Prize Laureate Seamus Heaney said that MacLean had \"saved Gaelic poetry... for all time\"."]}, {"page": "John MacCormick", "response": ["He resigned from the party in 1942 following his failure to persuade the party to adopt a devolutionist stance rather than supporting all out Scottish independence and due to the victory of Douglas Young over his favoured candidate, William Power, for the leadership of the SNP.
