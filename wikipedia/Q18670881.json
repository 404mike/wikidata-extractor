This exhibition was visited by Charles Darwin, and also on 12 November by Prince Albert and may have contributed to his ideas for the Great Exhibition of 1851 at the Crystal Palace.", "Bingley House was built about 1760 as Byngas Hall, but was shown on local maps as Byngas Hall as early as 1553, and was the home of James Farmer, whose daughter Mary married Charles Lloyd.

His sister Priscilla married Christopher Wordsworth  (brother of the poet) and another sister Anna Braithwaite was a Quaker preacher who toured Britain, Ireland and the United States several times.Edward H. Milligan, \u2018Braithwaite, Joseph Bevan (1818\u20131905)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 9 April 2017 He was educated by a private tutor with the idea that he would work at his father's bank, but finance bored him.  Instead he turned to poetry, his first publication appearing in 1795.  Soon after he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge and moved in with him, Coleridge agreeing to instruct him in return for \u00a380 a year.  Coleridge's \"To a Friend\" and \"To a Young Man of Fortune\" are probably addressed to Lloyd.  Coleridge introduced him to Charles Lamb, and the two supplied introductory and concluding verses to his next volume of poetry.  A new edition of Coleridge's poetry included poems by Lamb and Lloyd, and referred to the friendship of the authors.  Soon after, however, in November 1797, an author signing himself Nehemiah Higginbotham parodied the three of them (and perhaps Robert Southey) in the Monthly Magazine; this author turned out to be Coleridge himself.  A break followed, but Lloyd still referred to Coleridge as a friend in the preface to his novel Edmund Oliver, published in 1798. The work was, however, taken as parodic of Coleridge and their friendship ended, temporarily also causing a rift between Lamb and Coleridge.  That same year he published a volume of blank verse in collaboration with Charles Lamb.", "Around 1811 Charles Lloyd started suffering from auditory hallucinations and \"fits of aberration\" that resulted in his being confined to an asylum; first at The Retreat, followed by a private asylum at Gretford in Lincolnshire.\"The Quaker Lloyds in the Industrial Revolution\" by Humphrey Lloyd, (Hutchinson & Co., London, 1975), pp.239  From 1813 to 1815 he translated nineteen tragedies of Vittorio Alfieri into blank verse (revised and augmented to twenty-two in 1876 by Edgar Alfred Bowring). In 1818 he escaped and turned up at De Quincey's cottage, claiming to be the devil, but managed to reason himself out of that conviction.  Soon after he recovered, temporarily, and rejoined his wife in London.  A flurry of literary activity followed with the publication of Nugae Canorae (1819), Desultory Thoughts in London, Titus and Gisippus, and Other Poems (1821), and Poetical Essays on the Character of Pope (1822).  A small volume of poems in 1823 ended this burst of creativity, and from that time almost nothing is known of him.
