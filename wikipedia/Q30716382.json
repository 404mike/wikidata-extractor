Professionally he was also known as Edmund Perryman, EC Perriman, Edmund Kitsune, Anonyman and Anoniman.\nBagwell was born in Preston, England, and studied art at Leeds Polytechnic. His early career as a comics artist saw him write and draw his own strip, Syd Serene, for Deadline in 1988. He also illustrated Black Axe (1993) for Marvel UK, a Nick Fury strip for Marvel Comics Presents, a Judge Dredd story for 2000 AD, and stories for Crisis and other titles, before moving on to develop concept art and digital design for computer games and film companies. He returned to comics several years later, when he was headhunted to illustrate independent British comic Event Horizon. His work for that comic was noticed by Matt Smith, the editor of 2000 AD, who asked him to work on some one-off stories and then on new series Cradlegrave (2009). Other stories Bagwell illustrated for 2000 AD include Indigo Prime, The Ten-Seconders and Tharg's Future Shocks.\nHe died on 14 May 2017 of pancreatic cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Smith (comics writer)", "response": ["**** \"Everything and More\" (with Edmund Bagwell, in #1750\u20131753, 2011)", "**** \"Anthropocalypse\" (with Edmund Bagwell, in #1756\u20131763, 2011)", "**Cradlegrave (with Edmund Bagwell, in #1633\u20131644, 2009) collected as Cradlegrave (tpb, 96 pages, 2011, )", "*** \"Blackspot\" (with Edmund Bagwell, in #1801, 2012)"]}, {"page": "Arthur Wyatt", "response": ["** \"Pea Patch Podlings\" (with Edmund Bagwell, in 2000 AD #1674, March 2010)", "** \"Natural Order\" (with Edmund Bagwell, in 2000 AD #1527, 2007)", "** \"Rapture Ready\" (with Edmund Bagwell, in 2000 AD #1576, 2008)", "** \"Cargo Culture\" (with Edmund Bagwell, in 2000 AD #1664, December 2009)"]}, {"page": "Liam Sharp", "response": ["** \"Machivarius Point: Avatar\" (script, as Roger M.
