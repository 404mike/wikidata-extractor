In the early 1850s, Fry worked with Frederick Scott Archer, assisting him in the early experiments of the wet collodion process. He was also active in helping Roger Fenton to set up the Royal Photographic Society in 1853. Several of his photographs are in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of photographers", "response": ["* Peter Wickens Fry (1795\u20131860)"]}, {"page": "List of English people", "response": ["* Peter Wickens Fry (1798\u20131860), early amateur photographer"]}, {"page": "Jane Martha St. John", "response": ["In an album that was almost totally reserved for her and Edward's family she places a complete outsider, Peter Wickens Fry, on page 1, ahead of everyone, even before the portrait of the children that she helped to bring up. Fry seems to have given her the help that she would have needed before heading off on a journey to Italy (one he had already made) reasonably confident that she would return with what she wanted.  Also that it was probably Fry who guided her in the collodion process that she used in the years to follow."]}]}}
