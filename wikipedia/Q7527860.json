Cane produced a plan of around 1928, from which the names of the garden compartments have been taken and used in this description. Jarvis bought unemployed miners from the northern industrial town of Jarrow to Hascombe Court, where they built a Japanese style water and rock garden to Cane's design. Sir John Jarvis died in 1950.

After Malvern College, he went up to Cambridge and was called to the bar in 1928. He served in the Second World War in the Judge Advocate General's Department in the RAF, ending the war as a Wing Commander. In 1947, he set up chambers in Hunter Street, Chester, with Gerard Lind-Smith; this proved to be a successful partnership, with Williams taking on defence work. In 1949, he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Anglesey Quarter Sessions and became Chairman in 1960, serving until 1971. In the meantime, he was also the Recorder of Birkenhead (1950\u201358) and of Chester (1958\u201371), as well as Deputy Chairman of the Cheshire Quarter Sessions from 1952 to 1971, and Deputy Chairman (1953\u201361) and then Chairman (1961\u201371) of the Flintshire Quarter Sessions. In 1972, he was appointed a Recorder of the Crown Court, retiring in 1974. A devout Christian, he was also Chancellor of the Diocese of St Asaph from 1966 to 1983. In private, Williams enjoyed field sports (running his own shoot) and golf. He died in 1995, leaving a widow (Brenda, daughter of the industrialist and politician Sir John Jarvis, 1st Baronet) and four daughters. In 1971, he had succeeded his brother Reginald to the Williams baronetcy; on Francis's death, his half-brother Lawrence became the 9th baronet."]}]}}
