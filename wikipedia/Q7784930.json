However English courts have long refused to enforce trusts that only serve an abstract purpose, and are not for the benefit of people.See the old decision of Lord Eldon in Morice v Bishop of Durham (1805) 10 Ves 522 Only charitable trusts, defined by the Charities Act 2011, and about four other small exceptions will be enforced.See JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 14, 391\u2013420 The main reason for this judicial policy is to prevent, as Roxburgh J said in Re Astor's Settlement Trusts, \"the creation of large funds devoted to non-charitable purposes which no court and no department of state can control\".[1952] Ch 534 This followed a similar policy to the rule against perpetuities, which rendered void any trust that would only be transferred to (or \"vest\") in someone in the distant future (currently 125 years under the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 2009).Martin (2012) ch 14, 395\u2013398 In both ways, the view has remained strong that the wishes of the dead should not, so to speak, rule the living from the grave.cf LM Simes, Public Policy and the Dead Hand (University of Michigan Press 1955) It would mean that society's resources and wealth would be tied into uses that (because they were not charitable) failed to serve contemporary needs, and therefore made everyone poorer. Re Astor's ST itself concerned the wish of the Viscount Waldorf Astor, who had owned The Observer newspaper, to maintain \"good understanding... between nations\" and \"the independence and integrity of newspapers\".See also Re Shaw [1957] 1 WLR 729, Harman J held that a trust set up by the playwright George Bernard Shaw to investigate the introduction of a new 40 letter alphabet could not be enforced. While perhaps laudable, it was not within the tightly defined categories of a charity, and so was not valid. An example of a much less laudable aim in Brown v Burdett was an old lady's demand in her will that her house be boarded up for 20 years with \"good long nails to be bent down on the inside\", but for some reason with her clock remaining inside. Bacon VC cancelled the trust altogether.(1882) 21 Ch D 667 But while there is a policy against enforcing trusts for abstract and non-charitable purposes, if possible the courts will construe a trust as being for people where they can. For example, in Re Bowes[1896] 1 Ch 507 an aristocrat named John Bowes left \u00a35000 in his will for \"planting trees for shelter on the Wemmergill estate\", in County Durham. This was an extravagantly large sum of money for trees. But rather than holding it void (since planting trees on private land was a non-charitable purpose) North J construed the trust to mean that the money was really intended for the estate owners. Similarly in Re Osoba, the Court of Appeal held that a trust of a Nigerian man, Patrick Osoba, said to be for the purpose of \"training of my daughter\" was not an invalid purpose trust. Instead it was in substance intended that the money be for the daughter. Buckley LJ said the court would treat \"the reference to the purpose as merely a statement of the testator's motive in making the gift\".See also Re Denley's Trust Deed [1969] 1 Ch 373, per Goff J, that there would only be a purpose trust \"where that benefit is so indirect or intangible... as not to give those persons any locus standi to apply to the court to enforce the trust\"."]}, {"page": "High Sheriff of Durham", "response": ["*1852: John Bowes, of Streatham Castle"]}, {"page": "John Scott (horseman)", "response": ["During his career, John Scott trained for notable owners such as Edward Smith-Stanley the Earl of Derby, Evelyn Boscawen Viscount Falmouth, and John Bowes.

Another possible reason is that, for much of the nineteenth century, the Scottish and English estates had been split, with Streatlam and Gibside owned by John Bowes and his wife, which meant that the Scottish branch of the Bowes-Lyon family, namely the Earls of Strathmore, had not been in ownership or residence at Streatlam for from 1820 to 1885, thereby becoming more focused on their Scottish estates.
