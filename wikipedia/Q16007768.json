He later trained as a cameraman. Burke came to wider recognition through a number of British-led mountaineering expeditions during the 1960s and 1970s. These included expeditions led by Chris Bonington to Annapurna's South Face in 1970 and an unsuccessful attempt on Mount Everest's south-west face in 1972.\nMick Burke came from Abram, near Wigan, and began his climbing career at age 15 as a member of the Wigan Rambling and Climbing Club, when Jo Moran took him on his first hike up 2000 ft Pendle Hill in Lancashire.Burke was part of Bonington's 1975 Everest expedition, again to climb the south-west face. Burke's role was primarily as a climber, but he also provided high altitude film coverage for the BBC film crew accompanying the expedition. Following Dougal Haston and Doug Scott's first ascent of the face and successful climb to the summit, Burke was part of a second summit push, from which he did not return. He was last seen alive \"heading upwards, a few hundred metres from the summit\", but it is not known for sure that he reached the highest point. The weather began to deteriorate rapidly just after he was last seen, and within hours storms had set in which lasted for two days, precluding any rescue attempt by his companions who were themselves marooned in the top camp until the storms abated. His body was never recovered. After his death, Jo Moran said \"Mick was never a natural climber. But he succeeded because of his total dedication. His application to the sport was tremendous\"\nIn Burke's memory the BBC created the Mick Burke Award, which was jointly run by the BBC and the Royal Geographical Society. A local charity was also established - the Mick Burke Memorial Trust. The fund intended to promote outdoor pursuits and pioneering activities for young people from the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan and surrounding districts In the years immediately after his death, climbing colleagues helped to raise funds for the Trust, including through the first annual Mick Burke Memorial Illustrated Lecture in October 1977 at Wigan's Queens Hall. The guest speaker was Don Whillians, recounting his expedition with Joe Brown, Hamish Macinnes and Mo Anthoine\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chris Bonington", "response": ["In 1972 he was unsuccessful on the south-west face of Mount Everest, but reached 27,300 feet.

He describes himself variously as British and a New Zealander in his own account of the expedition. A band of cliffs on the southwest face, known as the Rock Band, had defeated five previous expeditions between 1969 and 1973. On September 20, Nick Estcourt and Paul Braithwaite achieved the first ascent of the Rock Band. The summit was reached by two teams: first on September 24 by Scott and Haston, who survived the highest ever bivouac when they were benighted on the South Summit during their descent. On September 26 four more climbers attempted a second ascent.

In the post-monsoon season Chris Bonington led the expedition which used rock climbing techniques to put fixed ropes up the face from the Western Cwm to just below the South Summit. A key aspect of the success of the climb was the scaling of the cliffs of the Rock Band at about  by Nick Estcourt and Tut Braithwaite. Two teams then climbed to the South Summit and followed the Southeast Ridge to the main summit \u2013 Dougal Haston with Doug Scott on 24 September 1975, who at the South Summit made the highest ever bivouac for that time, and Peter Boardman with Pertemba two days later. It is thought that Mick Burke fell to his death shortly after he had also reached the top. British climbers reached the summit of Everest for the first time in an event that has been described as \"the apotheosis of the big, military-style expeditions\".", "Bonington conceived of the idea of climbing Annapurna by its South Face which he realised was going to require siege tactics as well as rock climbing. What was to become the 1970 British Annapurna South Face expedition involved Haston as well as such climbers as Don Whillans, Mick Burke, Nick Estcourt, Martin Boysen and Ian Clough who was killed during the descent. The expedition was a huge success because not only was the summit reached but it was, for its time, the most difficult technical climb to the summit of a major world peak.", "The team was based on the climbers in the 1970 Annapurna and 1972 Southwest Face expeditions. Hamish MacInnes was to be deputy leader and Dougal Haston, Doug Scott, Mick Burke, Nick Estcourt, Mike Thompson and Martin Boysen agreed to take part. All except the last two had Southwest Face experience. A notable absentee was Don Whillans who was not invited because of personality clashes on the Annapurna expedition. People joining the team for the first time were Peter Boardman, Paul (\"Tut\") Braithwaite, Ronnie Richards, Dave Clarke, Allen Fyffe and Mike Rhodes. Rhodes was a Barclays employee, nominated by the bank. The doctors, both experienced mountaineers, were Charles Clarke and Jim Duff. Camp managers were Adrian Gordon and Mike Cheney who both spoke Nepali. There was to be a team of thirty-three climbing sherpas with Pertemba as sirdar and Ang Phu as deputy. Twenty-six porters for the Khumbu Icefall were led by their sirdar Phurkipa. There were further sherpas for general duties.", "The weather deteriorated further as Boardman and Pertemba descended and the visibility was getting worse. To their astonishment they encountered Burke, sitting in the snow, only a few hundred metres from the summit and above the Hillary Step. They had been assuming he had rejoined Boysen at camp 6. He asked them to return to the summit for him to photograph them but, seeing their reluctance, said he would go by himself to take some photographs and do some filming from the top. After agreeing to wait for him at the South Summit they separated. After a wait of over  hours at the South Summit in blizzard conditions the visibility was down to about  and it was getting dark so at 16:10 the pair started to descend the gully in the storm. They still had oxygen and they were fortunate to find the end of the fixed ropes in the dark. At 19:30 they at last rejoined Boysen at Camp 6. Boardman had frostbite and Pertemba, who had taken over half an hour to crawl the last , was snowblind. Mick Burke did not return. Boysen got frostbite while trying to reduce the snow piling on the box tents during the 36 hours that they were stormbound before being able to descend to Camp 5.", "Mick Burke's body has not been found but it is thought likely he did reach the summit."]}, {"page": "1970 British Annapurna South Face expedition", "response": ["Mount Everest was ascended in 1963 by an American team along a deliberately difficult route along its West Ridge.  Two years later, when planning with the American John Harlin for Harlin's direttissima attempt on the North Face of the Eiger, Harlin introduced Bonington to the American big wall technique of directly ascending a fixed rope using jumars. Harlin fell to his death and Haston's success on the route were reported on by Bonington and Mick Burke who were on the North Face as climbing journalist and cameraman. The publicity led to the televising of a climb of the Old Man of Hoy in Scotland, this time featuring Bonington and Haston. From this start, commercial sponsorship became a possibility for rock climbing and more elaborate and ambitious expeditions could be planned. With all fourteen 8000-metre peaks climbed by 1964, Himalayan expeditions using rock climbing routes became an opportunity Bonington wanted to seize."]}, {"page": "Jo Moran", "response": ["Joseph Moran (2 June 1930 \u2013 11 July 2021) was an English ornithologist, wildlife photographer, mountaineer and climber. He was the first person to climb the cliffs of the Noup of Noss in Shetland, Scotland, the first to photograph the Leach's storm petrel at the nest, and was also an early influence on British mountaineer and climber Mick Burke.", "Jo Moran was a member of the Wigan Rambling and Climbing Club, where he met the young Mick Burke, who was to become a celebrated mountaineer and climber. Jo took Mick on his first hike up 2000ft Pendle Hill in Lancashire. During this period, he met musician Barry Halpin, who was later to be mistaken for missing peer Lord Lucan."]}, {"page": "Franz Oppurg", "response": ["It is possible that Mick Burke, climbing solo, reached the summit of Everest via the Southwest face, as part of the 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition led by Chris Bonington; Burke did not return from his attempt after a snowstorm hit the mountain.  After Oppurg, Reinhold Messner was the next solo summiter; he climbed Everest alone, without oxygen, from the North side. Dr. Peter Hackett (member of the 1981 American Medical Research Expedition led by John B. West), on 24 October 1981, was the third; like Oppurg, he climbed alone, with oxygen, from the South Col to the summit."]}]}}
