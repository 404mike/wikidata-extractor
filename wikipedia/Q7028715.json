Beardsley made his Preston debut in a 2\u20130 home win over Huddersfield Town in the League Cup on 14 August 2012, assisting the club's second goal of the match, with his low cross being scored by Nicky Wroe. He scored his first goal for Preston on 4 September 2012 after converting David Amoo's cross in the third-minute of their 1\u20131 away draw with Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, a tie that Preston won 3\u20131 on penalties. Beardsley scored one further goal that month, heading in Jeffrey Monakana's cross on 64 minutes as Preston came from behind to beat Yeovil Town 3\u20132 at home. It proved to be Beardsley's last goal for five months, ending his goal drought in a 3\u20131 away loss to Yeovil on 12 February 2013, in what was Westley's last match in charge of the club. Beardsley made just two appearances under new manager Simon Grayson over the remainder of the season, both as a second-half substitute.

Gillingham equalised in first-half injury time, Cody McDonald scoring from close range. The visitors took the lead just after the interval, Adebayo Akinfenwa, who also scored for Gillingham in the reverse fixture, scored from six yards out following good work by Joe Martin. Stevenage manager Graham Westley made two second-half changes, bringing on Ben May and Peter Winn, the latter supplying the cross for Harrison to score his second with fifteen minutes remaining to restore parity. Another 2\u20132 draw followed three days later, this time against Accrington Stanley. Stevenage had a two-goal lead courtesy of strikes from Byron Harrison and Lawrie Wilson, but two late Accrington goals meant that the points were shared. Three days after the draw with Accrington, Stevenage travelled to Gigg Lane for their first ever game against Bury. The game ended 3\u20130 to Bury, courtesy of goals from Andy Bishop, ex-Stevenage defender Efe Sodje, and Ryan Lowe. Stevenage fell to their fifth consecutive away defeat just four days later, losing 1\u20130 at Shrewsbury Town courtesy of a first-half Nicky Wroe strike. The club made it five league games without victory on 15 February, drawing 0\u20130 at home to Oxford United. Four days after the stalemate with Oxford, Stevenage secured their first away win in four months, winning 1\u20130 at Crewe Alexandra courtesy of an 87th-minute goal from Byron Harrison \u2013 Stevenage's first away goal in the league since 2 November 2010. This was followed up with another away win three days later, this time securing three points against Port Vale at Vale Park, winning the match 3\u20131. Stevenage took the lead fifteen minutes before the interval when Anthony Griffith's 30-yard backpass took a bobble and rolled over Port Vale goalkeeper Chris Martin's foot. The visitors doubled their lead seven minutes later when Peter Winn scored a low drilled effort. Port Vale got a goal back through Sam Morsy, but David Bridges restored Stevenage's two-goal lead after Byron Harrison's cross had ricocheted off the goalkeeper and fell to the feet of Bridges. Stevenage's last game of February was a home game against Cheltenham Town, with Stevenage securing their third consecutive league victory, winning the game 4\u20130. Goals from Mark Roberts and Byron Harrison had given Stevenage a two-goal lead going into half-time. Michael Bostwick added a third in the 52nd minute, lashing the ball across goal from just inside the area after a tidy interchange with Byron Harrison. Two minutes later, Harrison then added his second of the game, and Stevenage's fourth, when he headed in Lawrie Wilson's right wing cross."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["Midfielder Simon Walton joined Sheffield United on a season-long loan.\"Simon Walton's switch to Sheffield United is his last chance, says Peter Reid\" .

Most significantly, after first being dropped for September's match against Aldershot and then again for the trip to Crewe Alexandra, club captain Nicky Wroe was placed on the transfer list.  It was also made known that the club would be open to offers for defender Kieran Charnock who had struggled to break up the central defensive partnership forged by Mark Ellis and Guy Branston.", "No new additions were made to the squad during the month, although the loan deal for Joe Oastler was extended until January while Wolves agreed to allow Ashley Hemmings to extend his stay at Plainmoor.

However, Gulls fans were relieved when the window closed with Benyon still part of the United squad - at least until the January transfer window.  Of the two players placed on the transfer list in October, Kieran Charnock moved on loan to Morecambe, with a view to making the deal a permanent one in January.

As such he had been tracked by several clubs over a number of months and his eventual move had been seen as inevitable by the majority of Gulls fans.  The last day of the window also saw the transfer of Nicky Wroe to Shrewsbury and the cancellation of Ashley Hemmings\u2019 loan deal with Wolves.
