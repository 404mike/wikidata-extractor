The episode was written by Simon Norman and directed by Steve Brett, and premiered on BBC One on 11 August 2018. The plot follows an accident which sees paramedic Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) swerve his ambulance, containing paramedic Ruby Spark (Maddy Hill) and registrar Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny), to avoid hitting a woman who jumped off a bridge, creating a multi-car pile up and a petrol tanker exploding. The episode was announced on 24 July 2018 via the show's Twitter account. The stunt, which heavily focuses on the show's paramedic crew, marks the beginning of the new series, which was billed as \"The Year of the Paramedic\". Planning for the crash took place over several months and ten different explosions were created to display the fireball explosion.", "Paramedics Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) and Ruby Spark (Maddy Hill) are called out to the flat of couple Mia Bellis (Simona Zivkovska) and Base Newman (Max Parker). Mia has told Base that she has overdosed on medication. Iain and Ruby fail to find any pill bottles and ask Mia if she is being honest; Mia tells Iain that she lied about overdosing, and that he does not care about her, and will not care about her or her mental health until it is too late. Then, a call comes in on Iain's radio about a woman suffering severe bleeding after being pushed through a door. Iain recognises the address of the injured casualty as Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and tells Ruby that they need to leave. Ruby is sceptical about leaving Mia, but Iain tells Ruby not to question him.", "Salt explained that there would be a greater focus on the \"front line of the NHS\" from this episode. The actress dubbed the episode \"adrenaline-filled\" and \"quite intense\". In an interview with Christine Lampard on chat show Lorraine, Salt likened the episode to a late night special, which explores the \"gritty, dark side\" of paramedic life. She also described episode 1094 as a \"very emotional [and] high-adrenaline\" episode which sees Sam and her former Army colleague, paramedic Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), go \"full circle\" with their relationship and work together in a \"high-stress environment\". Stevenson billed the episode as \"gripping\", and told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that the events of the episode will alter Iain's life \"forever\". He commented, \"Everything that happens in the episode adds another level of guilt and jeopardy to all the characters it affects.\" The actor added that the episode would \"share stories, raise awareness and create drama at the same time\"."]}, {"page": "Holby City (series 21)", "response": ["Twelve Holby City regular cast members - Marcel (Jac Naylor), Barrett (Sacha Levy), Quarshie (Ric Griffin), Guy Henry (Henrik Hanssen), Catherine Russell (Serena Campbell), Alex Walkinshaw (Adrian \"Fletch\" Fletcher), Kaye Wragg (Essie Di Lucca), Jaye Jacobs (Donna Jackson), Marcus Griffiths (Xavier \"Xav\" Duval), Nic Jackman (Cameron Dunn), Camilla Arfwedson (Zosia Self), and Belinda Owusu (Nicky McKendrick) - appear in the Casualty episode of the crossover, originally broadcast on 2 March 2019, alongside the cast of Casualty.
