He made his professional debut for the club in May 2014 and went on to make 141 appearances in five years with the U's. In June 2019, Kent signed for Peterborough United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John McGreal", "response": ["McGreal strengthened his front-line for the 2018\u201319 season, signing midfielder Harry Pell (undisclosed six-figure fee) and strikers Frank Nouble (free transfer) and Luke Norris (undisclosed fee). Colchester enjoyed a strong first half of the campaign, and a 1\u20130 win at Milton Keynes Dons saw them head into Christmas in the automatic promotion places. He signed Ben Stevenson on a permanent basis in January. However the promotion campaign faltered, and despite beating champions Lincoln City on the final day, Colchester ended in eighth-place, a point outside the play-offs. He released Mikael Mandron in the summer, along with Ryan Gondoh. However he lost a series of players who turned down new contract offers: Brennan Dickenson, Sam Saunders, Rene Gilmartin and Dillon Barnes; whilst Frankie Kent, Sammie Szmodics and Kane Vincent-Young were sold on to other clubs."]}, {"page": "Shenfield High School", "response": ["*Frankie Kent, Footballer for Peterborough United"]}, {"page": "Magnus Okuonghae", "response": ["After missing a number of matches through suspension and the ensuing form of his replacement Frankie Kent, Okuonghae returned to action when he replaced Kent after only five minutes following a head injury he received after being struck by the ball on 21 October in a 2\u20131 victory at home to Chesterfield. In Colchester's 1\u20130 defeat at home to Coventry City on 22 November, Okuonghae suffered an achilles tendon rupture and had to be stretchered off the field late in the match.

He racked up his 100th appearance for Colchester on 12 August in their 4\u20130 League Cup defeat to Charlton Athletic. Eastman signed a new contract with the club on 16 October to see him through to the summer of 2016. Eastman's performances throughout January 2015 earned him a nomination for the League One \"Player of the Month\" award, alongside Dele Alli, Andy Butler and Tom Hopper, with manager Tony Humes saying that it was a \"great accolade for him [Eastman] that he's been nominated\". Eastman was an ever-present member of the squad throughout the season, having played every league and cup match. He achieved this by playing alongside 12 different central defence partners following Magnus Okuonghae's season-ending injury, including Okuonghae, Frankie Kent, Karleigh Osborne, Bongani Khumalo, Kaspars Gork\u0161s, Alex Wynter, Will Packwood, Jamie Harney, Alex Gilbey, David Wright, Cole Kpekawa and Sean Clohessy."]}]}}
