(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1998), 344\u201345. Spener wanted to strengthen and renew the church through the development of more knowledgeable and devoted members.  In his Pia Desideria, he gave six proposals of how to enact this reform: (1) to more thoroughly acquaint believers with Scripture by means of private readings and study groups in addition to preaching; (2) to increase the involvement of laity in all functions of the church; (3) to emphasize that believers put into practice their faith and knowledge of God; (4) to approach religious discussions with humility and love, avoiding controversy whenever possible; (5) to ensure that pastors are both well-educated and pious; and (6) to focus preaching on developing faith in ordinary believers.Philip Jacob Spener, Pia Desideria, trans. Theodore G. Tappert (Philadelphia, PA:  Fortress Press, 1964), 87\u2013122. As these proposals indicate, Spener saw positive change for the church as dependent primarily upon the pious involvement of individual believers.Howard C.
