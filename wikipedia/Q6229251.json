The subsequent sudden change to the centre of gravity made the aircraft \"rear up\", tearing off the cockpit section, the two engines and the tailplane.  The break-up of the DH.110 took less than one second.  According to Rivas, subsequent investigations showed that the wing failed because it had only 64 per cent of its intended strength.
