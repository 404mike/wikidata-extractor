Alderdice was born in Belfast, Ireland and was educated at Methodist College Belfast. He moved to Newfoundland in 1886. A prominent St. John's businessman, Alderdice was appointed to the Legislative Council of Newfoundland (the Upper House of the legislature) in 1924 and became leader of the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party and the dominion's Prime Minister when his cousin Walter Stanley Monroe retired from the post on August 15, 1928. Alderdice's first term as Prime Minister was short-lived, however, as his government lost that year's general election to the Liberals led by Sir Richard Squires.\nAlderdice joined with Liberals dissatisfied with Squires to form the United Newfoundland Party with himself as leader. The Great Depression embroiled the dominion in a severe economic crisis which was compounded by corruption in the Squires government taking the dominion to the brink of bankruptcy. Widespread unemployment added to the crisis and resulted in an anti-government riot in St. John's on April 5, 1932. The Squires government collapsed and Alderdice swept to power in the ensuing June election on the promise that if elected, his government would examine the possibility of suspending the constitution and having a commission administer the country until conditions improved. His United Newfoundland Party won 24 seats to only two for the Liberals.\nThe Alderdice government was unable to deal with the economic crisis and proposed a partial default on the dominion's debts. Britain and Canada (whose currency was shared by Newfoundland) agreed to give the dominion financial aid in exchange for the creation of an Imperial Royal Commission to investigate the dominion's future. The Commission recommended the suspension of responsible government and the institution of an appointed Commission of Government to rule the dominion.\nAlderdice was pressured by the British to accept the recommendations without calling a new election or submitting the proposals to a referendum. Alderdice agreed and, at the end of 1933, the legislature voted to accept the recommendations and voted itself out of existence. Alderdice was appointed to the Commission of Government when it was established in February 1934 and served  as Commissioner for Home Affairs and Education in the new Commission of Government as well as Vice-Chairman until his death in 1936.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Squires", "response": ["Squires remained in the House of Assembly, as an independent member.

In the election of 1928, Squires returned as Liberal leader and defeated the Conservatives."]}, {"page": "1872 in Canada", "response": ["*November 10 \u2013 Frederick C.

Its report, released in 1933, assessed Newfoundland's political system as institutionally corrupt and its economic future as bleak, recommending the abolition of responsible government, and its replacement by a Commission of the British Government. Acting on the report's recommendations, Alderdice's government voted itself out of existence in December 1933.

Economic collapse led to political crisis.

A new government led by Frederick C. Alderdice came to power after promising to ask the British Government to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the possibility of suspending responsible government.
