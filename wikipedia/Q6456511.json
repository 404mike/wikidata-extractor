He competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics in London. He was born in Callan, County Kilkenny, Ireland and died in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. In the 800 metres, Manogue did not finish his semifinal heat, dropping out around the half way mark and not advancing to the final. There is some discussion as to how he was selected to the British team in the first place.  His previous known competition had him finishing last in the slow heat at the AAA Championships.", "link_mentions": []}}
