On 7 June 2001, Kirby received a phone call from Oldham asking if he could come to play for Yorkshire first XI the following day as a substitute for Matthew Hoggard in their Championship fixture against Kent. After being given time off from his day job, Kirby took 7 for 50 from 24 overs to win the match for Yorkshire, the best by a Yorkshire debutant in Championship cricket since Paul Hutchison in 1997. His third match saw him face his old county Leicestershire, again Kirby was instrumental in Yorkshire's innings victory with match figures of 12 for 72.
