Maclean recounts how Charles Stoddart and Arthur Conolly were executed there in the context of The Great Game, and how Joseph Wolff, known as the Eccentric Missionary, barely escaped their fate when he came looking for them in 1845. In early October 1938 Maclean set out again, first for Ashkhabad (Ashgabat, capital of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic), then through the Kara Kum (Black Desert), not breaking his journey at either Tashkent or Samarkand, but pushing on to Kagan, the nearest point on the railway to Bokhara.  After trying to smuggle himself aboard a lorry transporting cotton, he ended up walking to the city, and spent several days sight-seeing \"in the steps of the Eccentric Missionary\" and sleeping in parks, much to the frustration of the NKVD spies who were shadowing him. He judged it an \"enchanted city\", with buildings that rivalled \"the finest architecture of the Italian Renaissance\".  Aware of his limited time, he cut short his wanderings and took the train towards Stalinabad (Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan), disembarking at Termez. This town sits on the Amu Darya (the Oxus), and the other side of the river lies in Afghanistan. Maclean claimed that \"very few Europeans except Soviet frontier guards have ever seen it at this or any other point of its course\". After more negotiations, he managed to cross the river and thus leave the USSR, and from that point his only guide seems to have been the narrative of \"the Russian Burnaby\", a colonel Nikolai Ivanovich Grodekov, who rode from Samarkand to Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat in 1878. The following day he and a guide set out on horseback, riding through jungle and desert, and detained on the way by dubious characters who may or may not have been brigands. (Maclean, a proficient linguist, was hamstrung on entering Afghanistan by the lack of any lingua franca.)  They rode past the ruins of Balkh, a civilization founded by Alexander the Great and destroyed by Genghis Khan.  After a night in Mazar, Maclean managed to get a car and driver, and progressed as rapidly as he could to Doaba, a village half-way to Kabul, where he had arranged to meet the British minister (i.e., ambassador), Colonel Frazer-Tytler.

The Jewish year for the destruction of the First Temple is traditionally given in Jewish computation as 3338 AM or 421/2 BCE. This differs from the modern scientific year, which is usually expressed using the Proleptic Julian calendar as 587 BCE. In Sana\u02bda, Jews had initially settled within the enclosed citadel, known as al-Qa\u1e63r, near the ruins of the old tower known as Ghumdan Palace, but were evicted from there in the late 6th century by the ruling monarch, and moved to a different section of the city, known as al-Marbaki (also called the Falayhi Quarter). From there, they again uprooted and were made to settle in the section of the city known as al-Quzali, and eventually moved and settled in the neighborhood of al-Sa'ilah. In 1679, during the Mawza Exile, they were once again evicted from their place of residence. Upon returning to the city in 1680, they were given a plot of land outside of the city walls, where they built the new Jewish Quarter, al-Q\u0101\u02bb (now Q\u0101\u02bb al-\u02bbUlufi), and where they remained until the community's demise in the mid-20th century.Yosef Tobi (ed.), Studies in 'Megillat Teman'  by Yi\u1e25yah Sala\u1e25, The Magnes Press: Hebrew University, Jerusalem 1986, p. 67 In 1839 the Reverend Joseph Wolff, who later went to Bukhara to attempt to save Lieutenant Colonel Charles Stoddart and Captain Arthur Conolly, found in Yemen, near Sana'a, a tribe claiming to be descendants of Jehonadab.Rechabites - Easton's Bible Dictionary After the creation of the political State of Israel in 1948, about 49,000 (of an estimated 51,000) of Yemenite Jews were airlifted to Israel, almost 10,000 of whom were from Sana\u02bda (see the English-language book Jews and Muslims in lower Yemen: a study in protection and restraint, 1918\u20131949). There was then essentially no Jewish population in Sana\u02bda until the Shia insurgency broke out in northern Yemen in 2004.
