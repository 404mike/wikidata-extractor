He was knighted in the King's Birthday Honours List in June 1923 and among his profession he was talked of as a future Solicitor-General.  However, at the 1923 general election the Conservative government led by Stanley Baldwin fell and he was defeated by the Liberal Party candidate Herbert Willison, who was ironically a longstanding friend and a solicitor who had instructed Maddocks to take on cases in the latter's early years as barrister.Shrewsbury Chronicle, 12 June 1931. At time of publication of Maddocks' obituary, Willison was prospective Liberal candidate for Shrewsbury. Maddocks did not stand for Parliament again."]}]}}
