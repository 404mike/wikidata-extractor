He debuted for Nottinghamshire Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship at the age of nineteen in June 1931. He made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire in the County Championship in 1934, and played a total of nine matches in the season without much success. He took his sole first-class wicket as a bowler against Sussex in June of that year.\nVaulkhard was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sir Julien Cahn playing in several of his teams in the 1930s. In 1939 he played one season for Northumberland.\nVaulkhard returned to first-class cricket in the 1946 season, becoming one of the first post-war debutants for Derbyshire. During this season, he hit his first and only first-class century, a spectacular innings of 264 against his former club Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, when he batted seven hours. This was the highest score of any Derbyshire player of the season, and at the time when the 1995 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was published it was the third highest score in first-class history by a player who never hit another century during their career. This innings was part of a fourth-wicket partnership with Denis Smith, which, at 328, remains a record for the team, and second in the list of single innings tallies for Derbyshire, only to George Davidson's innings of 274 in 1896.\nVaulkhard saw less involvement in first-class cricket in the 1947 season, and his averages tailed off to just five in the 1949 season. However Derbyshire had difficulties finding a committed captain in the post-war years, and Vaulkhard was called upon for the job in the 1950 season. He played more first-class games during this season than in any other, averaging 21 and scoring five first-class half centuries, while Derbyshire finished fifth in the County Championship under his leadership. During his final two years in first-class cricket, he played only five times, retiring from a first-class career spanning eighteen years in the 1952 season.\nVaulkhard was a middle-order batsman throughout his Derbyshire career, immediately prior to the emergence of Guy Willatt as a strong first-team player. He was a right-handed batsman and played 122 innings in 77 first-class matches with an average of 21.39 and a top score of 264. A powerful batsman, he regularly hit sixes, and once sent the ball over the football stand at Bradford. He had almost no backlift and so he relied on the punched straight drive. Vaulkhard occasionally kept wicket. As a bowler he took one first-class wicket at a cost of 124 runs.Vaulkhard died in Cambridge at the age of 83. Vaulkhard's brother, Geoffrey, represented Nottinghamshire's Second XI in 1949, while another brother, Denis, represented the same team in 1931.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kent College", "response": ["* Pat Vaulkhard, cricketer for Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire"]}, {"page": "Julien Cahn", "response": ["One of the earliest players was W. H. Vaulkhard, who joined the team in 1904; his four sons also took up the sport and played on Cahn's teams. Pat Vaulkhard became a first-class player in his day."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Derbyshire was the most improved team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.Playfair, pp. 91\u201392."]}, {"page": "Walter Fullwood", "response": ["Fullwood was born in Holmewood and during World War II played cricket frequently for the Metropolitan Police and Civil Defence Services. He joined Derbyshire at the end of the war and made his first-class debut in the 1946 season in May as wicket keeper against Leicestershire. He kept wicket in five more matches during the season but made low scores batting at the tail end. With Denis Smith and Pat Vaulkhard proving heavy hitters as well as reliable wicket-keepers, there was no place for Fullwood in the team."]}, {"page": "David Skinner (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1950, Derbyshire registered the former Cambridge University and Nottinghamshire amateur Guy Willatt to take over as captain, and though the registration was delayed until August and then scuppered by an immediate injury to Willatt, the county preferred to operate under the temporary captaincy of Pat Vaulkhard than to renew Skinner's tenure, Vaulkhard having at least a reputation for successful hard-hitting batsmanship. Willatt finally took over in 1951."]}, {"page": "Guy Willatt", "response": ["In 1950 Willatt returned from Scotland to teach at Repton and, like John Eggar and Dick Sale, combined cricket for Derbyshire with his teaching career. He was also released from teaching in the summer term so he could captain the county. He was designated captain in the 1950 season but was hampered by injury and Pat Vaulkhard substituted for him in the role while on the field Willatt was an unpredictable, middle-order batsman during his first season. He took over as captain in the 1951 season and occupied the post for the next three years, in which he played consistently for the team. He scored a century against his former team Nottinghamshire in 1951 and Derbyshire finished eleventh in the County Championship. In 1952, which was his personal best season, Willatt scored 1,624 runs, at an average of 35.3 including two centuries and the club were fourth in the Championship. In the 1953 season Willatt's batting average dropped, and Derbyshire slipped to sixth.  Willatt scored centuries against Kent and Sussex in the 1954 season and the club finished third in the county table."]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 4th || 328 ||  Pat Vaulkhard Denis Smith || v Nottinghamshire || Nottingham || 1946"]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["| 1950|| 30|| 8 || 9 || 13 || 5 ||Pat Vaulkhard || Alan Revill || Albert Rhodes || George Dawkes"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1946", "response": ["Derbyshire began their season with a tour of Ireland.
