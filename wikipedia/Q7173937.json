Loaned out to Doncaster Rovers and Shrewsbury Town in 1981, he joined Rochdale in 1982. He transferred to Crewe Alexandra in 1985, before he finished his career at non-league Barrow after a short tour of Europe. During this tour he played for V\u00e4stra Fr\u00f6lunda (Sweden), Norrby (Sweden), Keflav\u00edk (Iceland), Hamilton Academical (Scotland), and APOEL (Cyprus).

The \"Valiants\" finished 16th in the Fourth Division and later he left by mutual consent in August 1979. He had signed popular player Bernie Wright from Bradford City for \u00a39,000, however most of his big money signings had torrid times at Vale Park. He signed right-back Neil Wilkinson (free), Ken Todd (a club-record \u00a337,000 signing despite only having made a handful of appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers), Gerry Keenan (\u00a315,000), Felix Healy (\u00a38,000), Kevin Tully (\u00a33,000 plus Neil Wilkinson), Andy Proudlove (\u00a31,000), Peter Farrell (breaking the club-record again at \u00a340,000), and Bob Delgado (\u00a330,000).

Forward Bernie Wright came in from Bradford City for \u00a39,000. In August the club broke their transfer record for Wolves midfielder Ken Todd, paying \u00a337,000 for a youngster with just five league appearances to his name. John Frogatt was sold for \u00a38,000, Terry Bailey for \u00a32,000 and Mick Moore for \u00a32,000. Ken Beamish also was sold to Bury for \u00a335,000, whereas Vale bought his teammate Gerry Keenan for \u00a315,000. \u00a38,000 was also spent on Irishman Felix Healy.

Butler then threw himself into the transfer market, selling John Froggatt to Northampton Town for \u00a38,000, and then Mick Moore and Terry Bailey to Wigan Athletic and Northwich Victoria respectively, both for \u00a32,000. Another 'shrewd piece of business' came when star forward Ken Beamish was sold to Bury for \u00a335,000, whilst Gerry Keenan moved the other way for \u00a315,000. In October, Felix Healy was signed from Finn Harps for \u00a38,000, and Neil Wilkinson and \u00a33,000 were traded to Crewe in exchange for outside-right Kevin Tully. Winning five games in a sequence of eight, Todd was still a disappointment to fans, who began getting 'on his back'.

In January, legendary England goalkeeper Gordon Banks was appointed as coach, and results began to pick up as Vale were lifted into eighth spot. Healy left the club in February, only to return two weeks later. Behind the scenes there was trouble when Arthur McPherson ruled that club shares could only be transferable to a male relation, in order 'to safeguard plans by the current directors'. More defeats came, and the big money signings were targeted by fans for abuse. Butler reacted by calling the fans 'a bunch of yobs'. From mid-March, Vale went seven games with only one victory and one goal scored.

Bookmakers made Vale second favourites for relegation, though Smurthwaite intimated that he expected the club to reach the play-offs. Andy Smith was confirmed as the club's new first team coach whilst the club decided to not hire Peter Farrell after all; Farrell only found out the news on his future after he heard it reported on the radio, and said \"It would have been more respectful if someone had the decency to ring me up rather than leave it for 10 days\".
