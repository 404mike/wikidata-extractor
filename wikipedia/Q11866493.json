The first performance took place at the Glastonbury Festival in 1924. Already famous for \"The Immortal Hour\" and \"Bethlehem\", Boughton's growth as a unique and powerful operatic composer is evident in this treatment of the Tristram and Isolde legend. Feeling that Hardy's play offered too much unrelieved grimness he received the playwright's permission to import a handful of lyrics from his earlier published poetical works. The result is an altogether impressive and effective work, thought by many to be Boughton's masterpiece in this genre. In 2010, it was recorded on the Dutton Epoch label, in which Ronald Corp conducts the New London Orchestra, members of the London Chorus and with soloists Neal Davies (King Mark), Heather Shipp (Queen Iseult), Jacques Imbrailo (Sir Tristam), and Joan Rodgers (Iseult of Brittany)."]}, {"page": "Paul Daniel", "response": ["In 1982, Daniel received a position on the musical staff of the English National Opera and remained there until 1987.
