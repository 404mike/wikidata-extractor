OUCA's official historian, David Blair, notes that Hague was actually elected on a platform pledging to clean up OUCA, but that this was \"tarnished by accusations that he misused his position as Returning Officer to help the Magdalen candidate for the presidency, Peter Havey. Hague was playing the classic game of using his powers as President to keep his faction in power, and Havey was duly elected....

He still owned Gwenoro, but employed a manager to run it after Janet's death in 1994. He insisted that he would never leave Zimbabwe. \"Don't get fazed by the riots, hold your head high, do not be afraid,\" a friend reported him saying. \"Show you are not budging and the government will leave you alone.\" He dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography, The Great Betrayal, to criticising the Mugabe administration and a long succession of British figures he considered to have let him and Rhodesia down; he also defended and attempted to justify his actions as Prime Minister, and praised Nelson Mandela, calling him Africa's \"first black statesman\". Smith's enduring popularity among white Zimbabweans was evidenced by the long queues they formed to have him sign copies of the book on its release in Harare in December 1997. \"They were captured, hiding their faces and turning to the wall, as television cameras recorded their 'betrayal' for the evening news,\" Josephine Fisher records. Not all of the country's whites admired Smith; some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge what they saw as past errors caused the whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion."]}, {"page": "2001 in Zimbabwe", "response": ["* 29 June \u2013 An 18-page supplement to the Herald newspaper lists another 2030 farms which have been gazetted for compulsory acquisition by the government: 90 per cent of farming properties in the country are now listed for seizure; UK Daily Telegraph journalist David Blair is ordered to leave Zimbabwe."]}, {"page": "David Blair", "response": ["David Blair may refer to:", "*David Blair (Paralympian) (born 1975), American Paralympic athlete", "*David Blair (dancer) (1932\u20131975), British ballet dancer", "*David Blair (encyclopedist) (1820\u20131899), Irish Australian journalist and encyclopaedist", "*David Blair (filmmaker), American experimental filmmaker", "*David Blair (golfer) (1917\u20131985), Scottish amateur golfer", "*David Blair (journalist) (born 1973), British journalist, working for The Daily Telegraph", "*David Blair (mariner) (1874\u20131955), British second officer, transferred off the Titanic", "*David Blair (physicist) (born 1946), Australian physicist", "*Blair (poet) (David Blair, 1967\u20132011), American performance poet", "*David Blair (information technologist) (1947\u20132011), information retrieval scientist", "*David Blair (rugby union) (born 1985), Scottish rugby player", "*David Blair (director), British movie and TV director", "*David Blair Motorsports, a former NASCAR racing team"]}, {"page": "David Blair (Journalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Blair (journalist) "]}, {"page": "David Eady", "response": ["In December 2004, Eady ruled in favour of politician George Galloway after The Daily Telegraph newspaper had reported that documents had been found by journalist David Blair in Baghdad that appeared to show that Galloway had received money from Saddam Hussein's regime.
