He often participated in archaeological expeditions, and in 1954 participated in an underwater expedition of the Archaeological School of Athens near Chios.In 1960s, he was Dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Cape Town.\nThe hero of J.M. Coetzee's 2002 book \"Youth\"  (pp 23\u201324) describes the Cape Town Classics Department: \"Greek and pure mathematics are in his eyes the noblest subjects one can study at a university. From afar he reveres the lecturers in Greek, whose courses he cannot take: Anton Paap, papyrologist; Maurice Pope, translator of Sophocles; Maurits Heemstra, commentator on Heraclitus. Together with Douglas Sears, Professor of Pure Mathematics, they inhabit an exalted realm.\"\nIn August 1968, Pope resigned from his position and left the university, as he strongly disagreed with the interference of the racist government in the University's policy (namely, the government forced the University authorities to dismiss a job offer previously issued to a Black person). In 1969, Maurice Pope moved to teach and research in Oxford University.\nIn the 1980s, in cooperation with Jacques Raison, he prepared and published a corpus of Minoan Linear A inscriptions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maurice Pope", "response": ["Maurice Pope may refer to:", "* Maurice Pope (linguist)"]}, {"page": "Lathbury Road", "response": ["The historian Ralph Henry Carless Davis (1918\u20131991) lived in Lathbury Road with his wife Eleanor.
