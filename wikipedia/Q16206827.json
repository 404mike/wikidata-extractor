He has been chairman since December 2004, after taking the club out of administration. In 2007, he became joint-chairman with Mark Lawn. Julian Rhodes sold the club in 2016 to German owners Edin Rahic and Stefan Rupp. But returned to the club in 2018 as a consulty role.He was born in Bradford and studied at Huddersfield Polytechnic.\nHe  played lead guitar for the Heavy Metal band Pegasus between 1983\u20131985 with Eggy Watson (drums), Ant Smith (rhythm guitar) & Micky Rowbottom (vocals).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Valley Parade", "response": ["Richmond also planned to increase the main stand's capacity by a further 1,800\u00a0seats by building new changing rooms and office blocks, and add a second tier to the Midland Road stand, to increase the ground capacity to more than 35,000. However, the club went into administration in May 2002, and Richmond was replaced by new co-owners Julian Rhodes and Gordon Gibb. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb's pension fund for \u00a35\u00a0million, with the club's offices, shop and car park sold to London-based Development Securities for an additional \u00a32.5\u00a0million. Bradford City's annual rent bill in 2011 to Gibb's pension fund is \u00a3370,000.

Club captain David Wetherall temporarily took over and was later announced as caretaker manager for the rest of the 2006\u201307 season. On 22 May 2007, it was announced McCall would become manager of the club where he started his career, and on 1 June 2007 he assumed the position. In less than seven years since McCall's first two-game reign, serious financial problems had driven the club to the verge of closure, and although they survived the threat of oblivion, they were unable to avoid a terrible on-the-pitch decline, which continued after the financial nightmare had been relieved. On McCall's return to Valley Parade, the Bantams had just been relegated to League Two\u2014meaning that they would be playing in the bottom division for the first time in 25 years. McCall set himself a target of earning promotion back to League One in his first season.", "As a result of maintaining a place in the promotion places during the first half of the season and his \"stabling influence\" on the club, chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn offered McCall a new contract in January 2009. Later in the month, Lawn gave further backing to McCall, who was coming under pressure from the club's fans following a run of one win in nine games; during the run McCall was also charged by The Football Association for the first time of his managerial career after he had contested a refereeing decision during a game with Luton Town. McCall signed a new contract in February, which extended his deal by another two years and would have kept him at the club until 2011. He set himself the goal of earning two promotions to put City in the Championship. However, less than a month later, McCall offered to resign if they did not reach the play-offs after his side lost 4\u20131 to AFC Bournemouth \u2013 their fifth consecutive away defeat. \"Nobody is hurting more than me but it's as simple as that, if we miss out I don't deserve to be here,\" he said. City eventually missed out on promotion, but McCall decided to stay on as manager and took a voluntary pay cut in the process because of the club's budget being reduced."]}, {"page": "Dean Windass", "response": ["However, on 17 January 2007, it was confirmed that Windass would return to Hull City on loan until the end of the season. The money Hull paid for the loan deal and the savings Bradford made on Windass' wages ensured Bradford City chairman Julian Rhodes could pay urgent bills. He was not to return to Bradford City and he finished with 76 league goals and 87 goals in total.

The run of games included the third goal in a 3\u20131 win against former side Darlington at the Darlington Arena. On 19 April 2008, he scored his sixth goal for the club, but first in a home game, when his last minute goal gave Bradford a 2\u20131 win over Grimsby Town. Three days later, Colbeck was announced as the club's player of the season, even though he had started just 26\u00a0league games, 23 of which came in City's 26\u00a0games since Colbeck returned on loan from Darlington. Colbeck was surprised to win the award, saying: \"If you'd said at the beginning of the season that I would win this award, I'd have thought you were mad. I wasn't even a regular in the team.\" However, in the following league game, Colbeck was sent off for the second time in his career, for a foul on Dean Lewington, as City lost 2\u20131 to Milton Keynes Dons, which meant he missed the final game of the season through suspension."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Leeds United F.C. season", "response": ["* 23 February: Bradford City joint-chairman, Julian Rhodes offers his support to Leeds in their fight against their 15-point deduction."]}, {"page": "Mark Lawn", "response": ["Mark Lawn (born August 1960) was the Bradford City chairman along with Julian Rhodes from 2007 to 2016.
