In the 1850s he wrote and illustrated various guidebooks to Southampton, Bournemouth and other south coast places.  He designed the Church of the Saviour in Southampton (1859), and a concrete bridge over the River Axe (Lyme Bay) at Seaton, Devon (1877) which pioneered the use of the material.  He was granted patents relating to the use of concrete in building design, and also for \u201cnavigable balloons\u201d, of which he was a keen advocate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Dell (Southampton)", "response": ["The site on which the ground was built was described in Philip Brannon's Picture of Southampton, published in 1850, as \"a lovely dell with a gurgling stream and lofty aspens\"; the stream is the Rollsbrook which flows out of Southampton Common, running parallel to Hill Lane before now disappearing under Commercial Road and the Central Station, from where it is conduited under Southampton Docks into Southampton Water. The land had been purchased in the 1880s by the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway to enable them to continue their line from Winchester via Twyford, Chandlers Ford, a tunnel at Chilworth and Shirley where it was to pass to the north-east of what is now St James' Park and St. James' Church. From here the line would have travelled south across Hill Lane to run through the dell and onto an embankment leading to a viaduct over Commercial Road and the London and South Western Railway line before terminating on the Western Esplanade, north of the Royal Pier.Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway\", Sands, T.B. Deposited Plans Hampshire Record Office Collection DP/384/1 Didcot Newbury and Southampton Junction Railway: deposited plan 1881 The dell was stripped of vegetation and the stream channelled into a conduit with work started on the embankment, which survives behind property to the north of Commercial Road but was never used, and the viaduct which was part built but later demolished.  The project was abandoned at this point and agreement reached to connect to the London and South Western Railway at Shawford Junction with running rights into Southampton."]}, {"page": "Brannon", "response": ["* Philip Brannon (1817-1890), British artist, engraver, writer, printer, architect and civil engineer"]}, {"page": "St Mary's Church, Southampton", "response": ["In 1850, Philip Brannon wrote in his Picture of Southampton: It has been recently enlarged by the addition of two wings; and is now in tolerable repair, but more remarkable for its bold defiance of all architectural propriety, than for any other characteristic: tall clustered columns being carried from the floor to support a horizontal beam or entablature close to the ceiling, whilst plain round windows contrast the pointed arch of the ancient chancel.By the 1870s, the poor construction of the 1833 church alterations revealed considerable deterioration, and in the 1870s Bishop Samuel Wilberforce sought advice from the eminent architect G. E. Street, who condemned the building."]}, {"page": "Seaton branch line", "response": ["The original powers for the Company had included the provision of a toll bridge over the River Axe to the east of Seaton station, giving access to the village of Axmouth. The small harbour there had road access on that side of the Axe. A contract for the bridge was let to William Jackson of Westminster on 15 December 1875; the engineer was Philip Brannon."]}]}}
