According to Furman, Death's Head was simply a 'throwaway character' which would 'be discarded down the line (probably at the end of the first story arc)'.Furman, Simon (2006). \"Freelance Peacekeeping Agent Open For Business (or how Death's Head came to be)\", Death's Head Volume 1, Panini Publishing,  However, when artist Geoff Senior showed Furman the initial character designs, both agreed Death's Head had potential beyond his planned transitory appearance. To avoid Hasbro claiming ownership of the character as a consequence of the Transformers copyright terms agreed with Marvel, Death's Head had to make his debut in another Marvel comic before appearing in Transformers. Accordingly, Furman wrote a single-page \"Death's Head\" strip that has become known as \"High Noon Tex\", illustrated by Bryan Hitch). In this short strip, Death's Head was a noir-ish contract killer of human proportions (thus anticipating the character's size and occupation post-Transformers appearances). The idea was that the strip would be published in a number of Marvel UK titles prior to appearing in The Transformers \u2013 although there is no evidence of any such an early publication. Death's Head made his debut as the giant robotic bounty hunter in the weekly The Transformers comic beginning with issue 113 (16 May 1987), and appearing during this initial run in 13 issues in total: #114, #117-#119, #133-#134, and #146-#151 (ending 6 February 1988).", "| Story John Freeman (1, 4, 6);Dan Abnett (2\u20133, 5); John Tomlinson (7, 12); Simon Furman (8\u20139); Simon Jowett (10); Mike Collins/Tim Robins (11); art Geoff Senior (1, 6, 11); John Ridgway (2\u20133); Art Wetherell/Dave Harwood (4); Art Wetherell (5); Andy Wildman (7, 10); John Marshall/Stephen Baskerville (8\u20139); Cam Smith (12)"]}, {"page": "Transformers", "response": ["In 1986, the cartoon became the film The Transformers: The Movie, which is set in the year 2005.

Unicron, a transformer who devours planets, fears its power and recreates a heavily damaged Megatron as Galvatron, as well as Bombshell or Skywarp becoming Cyclonus, Thundercracker becoming Scourge and two other Insecticons becoming Scourge's huntsmen, the Sweeps. Eventually, Rodimus Prime takes out the Matrix and destroys Unicron. In the United Kingdom, the weekly comic book interspliced original material to keep up with U.S. reprints, and The Movie provided much new material.

The Transformers theme tune for the film was performed by Lion with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic adding a song to the soundtrack.", "In the United Kingdom, the mythology continued to grow. Primus was introduced as the creator of the Transformers, to serve his material body that is planet Cybertron and fight his nemesis Unicron.

The character is depicted as a robotic bounty hunter (or rather, as he calls himself, a \"freelance peace-keeping agent\"), and often ends sentences with \"yes?\". The character was created by writer Simon Furman and artist Geoff Senior for the company's Marvel UK imprint. Furman decided to use Death's Head in his Transformers stories, but believed that characters appearing in Transformers \"were prone to be absorbed into that title's catchall copyright\" (allowing Hasbro to contest their ownership) and led to a one-page strip titled \"High Noon Tex\" (which was subsequently published in various Marvel UK titles) being hastily created to establish Marvel's ownership of the character.  Furman has stated that he chose the name Death's Head for the character, while being unaware of the \"Nazi-connotations of the name\", referring to the Waffen-SS Totenkopf Division, whose name translates to \"death's head\".", "Geoff Senior then showed Furman the initial character designs, at which point they decided that the character had potential beyond his planned appearance as a \"generic, stock mech-with-an-attitude\".

Evelyn Necker had to hire Death's Head to stop this threat. Using a time machine, Death's Head went back in time to gather the surviving Fantastic Four and several other superheroes, offering them a shot at avenging Reed by ending Charnel - and then let them all get killed softening up Charnel for him. Using his firepower on Charnel and goading him at not using the full potential of his gestalt mind, he got the cyborg to access these scientific minds - knowing this allowed Reed Richards' mind (still fighting within Charnel) to take control of the cyborg's motor functions, allowing him to kill it.
