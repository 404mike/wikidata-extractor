Drury Lane turned him down, but after successful work in Norwich, Ipswich and other eastern towns, Samuel Foote gave him his first London appearance in 1762 at the Haymarket Theatre, as Will Tirehack in The Orators, opposite John Palmer as Harry Scamper, who also made his debut on that occasion.John Adolphus, Memoirs of John Bannister, Comedian, 2 Vols (Richard Bentley, London 1839), Vol. 1, p. 4. Bannister remained Palmer's friend thereafter with 'manly firmness and immoveable constancy'. Long afterwards, in June 1787, Palmer as manager of the Royalty Theatre attempted to present dramatic works (including As You Like It), and then other lighter entertainments of the stage, with the encouragement of Arthur Murphy, contrary to Statute. Bannister, even after the legal danger was apparent, remained with him, and was committed for trial, though the warrant was superseded.Adolphus 1839, Vol. 1 pp. 155\u201359.", "He was said to have 'one of the most extensive falsettos ever heard'.H. van Thal, Solo Recital, The Reminiscences of Michael Kelly (abridged), with Biographical Index (Folio Society, London 1972), p. 330. Garrick took Felice Giardini to hear Bannister's imitations of Tenducci and Champneys, and the composer observed that the mimicry was perfect, but the fault was that the mimic was better than the performers themselves.Adolphus 1839, Vol. 1, p. 6. Michael Kelly refers to his appearance as Polly in a travesty of The Beggar's Opera at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket in 1781, in which he 'gave her tender airs with all the power of his deep and sonorous bass voice.' He brought it off not by mimicking feminine intonation or mincing gait, antics or 'superadded drolleries', but by the ridiculous incongruity of his deep voice and muscular frame, by an occasional display of ankle, and by the perfect judgement with which he sang Polly's songs.A detailed account of this production is in John Bannister's Memoirs, see Adolphus 1839, Vol. 1 p. 69-74. It was given 18 times in one short season at the Haymarket and also on occasion at Covent Garden. This was heard with great disgust by the visiting Italian male soprano Ferdinando Mazzanti, who did not realize it was a burlesque production.Michael Kelly (with Theodore Hooke), Memoirs (1826), abridged as Solo Recital: The Reminiscences of Michael Kelly ed.

Michael Kelly (Memoirs, ed. van Thal 1972, p. 283) states that Sheridan was engaged in a debate in the House when the news of the fire came, but although on his behalf it was moved that the House should adjourn, he insisted that 'Public duty ought to precede all private interest' and remained there with Roman fortitude while his theatre burned. Already on the shakiest financial ground, Sheridan was ruined entirely by the loss of the building. He turned to brewer Samuel Whitbread, an old friend, for help.Morning Chronicle, 7 July 1815.

No amount of re-writing could get around the problem that Richard was supposed to sing his famous ballad so that Blondin would hear it outside the castle walls.

Michael Kelly was now established as the audience's favourite star after Bannister, and was given a Benefit Night in 1790 \u2013 by tradition, he could choose whatever piece he believed would bring in the best receipts at the box-office. At this period a \"programme\" at Drury Lane would always be a double-bill \u2013 a main work, and a one-act \"afterpiece\" which was usually a comedy. Kelly broke with tradition and risked his income by announcing \u2013 to Sheridan's disapproval \u2013 that instead of a popular favourite, he would premiere a new afterpiece by Storace, called No song, no supper. No Song outsold even The Haunted Tower, and proved the best-selling show at Drury Lane for the following decade.
