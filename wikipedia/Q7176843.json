Pride of place goes to the nine publications from Roy Lewis' Keepsake Press, some quite substantial, such as Poetry & Paradox (1976) with its 19 poems and introductory essay, or Birmingham! Birmingham! (1985) with its 22. Comparable with these are Goldrush from Roger Pringle\u2019s Celandine Press (Shipston-on-Stour, 1983), which has 19 titles of which one is a six-part sequence, and Variations from Aldeburgh from Peter Scupham\u2019s Mandeville Press (Hitchin, 1987), which has 13 poems. Several of these books were made even larger by the number of illustrations that accompanied the poems: in the latter work there are eight line drawings by Donald Fairhall, while the three poems in Flowering Cypress from Kenneth Lindley\u2019s Pointing Finger Press  (Hereford, 1986) are supplemented by four of the artist\u2019s woodcuts and a linoprint. Birmingham printers who used Lowbury\u2019s work include F.E.Pardoe (The Ring, 1979) and David Wishart, whose Hayloft Press published a number of folded cards between 1987-97."]}, {"page": "Keepsake Press", "response": ["*The Gift by Peter Scupham (1973)"]}, {"page": "K.

His first book of poems, Any Day, was not universally well received: one reviewer contextualizes it within \"some backwash of the forties\" and finds Gransden \"rather young to be so dated.\" His only other book of poetry was a chapbook of fifteen poems published by Peter Scupham's small fine-press, Mandeville, in 1981, in a limited edition of 250 copies. Gransden was never primarily a poet, but he gained respectability among those who were, and Philip Larkin included his \"An Interview\" in The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse. His connections to other writers proved more fruitful than his own creative work, none more so than E.M. Forster, who recommended Gransden's book about him most among the many that were published in the last decade of Forster's life.
