To know the Truth, suggested Kabir, drop the \"I\" or the ego. Kabir's legacy survives and continues through the Kabir panth (\"Path of Kabir\"), a religious community that recognises him as its founder and is one of the Sant Mat sects. Its members are known as Kabir panthis.David Lorenzen (Editors: Karine Schomer and W. H.

The ideological messages in the legends appealed to the poor and oppressed. According to David Lorenzen, legends about Kabir reflect a \"protest against social discrimination and economic exploitation\", they present the perspective of the poor and powerless, not the rich and powerful. However, many scholars doubt that these legends of persecution are authentic, point to the lack of any corroborating evidence, consider it unlikely that a Muslim Sultan would take orders from Hindu Brahmins or Kabir's own mother demanded that the Sultan punish Kabir, and question the historicity of the legends on Kabir.", "Some scholars state Kabir's ideas were one of the many influencesWH McLeod (2003), Exploring Sikhism: Aspects of Sikh Identity, Culture, and Thought, Oxford University Press, , pages 19\u201331David Lorenzen (1981), Religious change and cultural domination, Colegio Mexico, , pages 173\u2013191 on Guru Nanak, who went on to found Sikhism in the fifteenth century.
