Born in Liskeard, Cornwall, he initially joined Burnley as a director before taking charge of the first team for three matches following the death of former manager Spen Whittaker. His first match in charge was the 0\u20131 defeat to Glossop at Turf Moor on 18 April 1910. Five days later, the team drew 1\u20131 with Leicester Fosse and his final match in charge was the 3\u20130 victory at home to Lincoln City on 30 April 1910, which was the final match of the 1909\u201310 season. He subsequently returned to his role as a director and was replaced as manager by John Haworth prior to the start of the 1910\u201311 campaign. Wadge died in London in 1923, at the age of 59.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Barron", "response": ["Barron remained a regular member of the Burnley team well into the 1909\u201310 season, but found himself out of the side after the death of manager Spen Whittaker in April 1910.

The Horwich-born defender would go on to play 137 league games for the Clarets.Simpson (2007), p. 485 In the summer of 1910, new manager John Haworth signed Scottish fullback Bob Reid from Cowdenbeath, and Barron subsequently found his first-team opportunities limited, playing only four matches in the 1910\u201311 campaign. He made his 400th and final league appearance for Burnley in the goal-less draw with Barnsley on 1 April 1911.

During his first summer in charge, he signed Burnley's first foreign player, German defender Max Seeburg. Soon afterwards, he changed the colour of Burnley's strip as he considered the green kit to be unlucky. He opted to change the colours to claret and blue, to match the strip of reigning Football League champions Aston Villa. Towards the close of the 1910\u201311 season, Haworth pulled off his first major signing when he persuaded England centre forward Bert Freeman to join the club from Everton. The following season, Haworth guided the team to a third-placed finish in the Second Division, narrowly missing out on promotion. In the 1912\u201313 campaign, Burnley reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup before losing to Sunderland after a replay. That year, the team finished second in the league to gain promotion to the First Division."]}, {"page": "R.H.
