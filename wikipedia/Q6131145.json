The majority of his work is carved in wood; there are also sculptures modelled in plaster and clay, some of which have been cast into bronze.Castle was born in 1946, in Aberdeen, Scotland. He was educated at Ealing School of Art, London; Winchester School of Art, Winchester, where he was taught by Heinz Henghes; and the Royal College of Art, London. He worked as a senior lecturer in sculpture at the University of Gloucestershire, Cheltenham.A lot of Castle's work depicts loosely, or cryptically anthropomorphic animals. He says: \"I think one of the reasons I began to use animals as a metaphor for the human condition came from the fact that we like to bestow these creatures with the same kinds of emotions as our own, without ever really knowing what is going on... this 'one step removed' from our reality is of interest to me.\"He was an invited artist at the Royal West of England Academy in 2006. He exhibits with the Compass Gallery, Glasgow, and with the Bohun Gallery, Henley upon Thames.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Winchester School of Art", "response": ["* James Castle, sculptor"]}, {"page": "List of University of Southampton people", "response": ["* James Castle, draughtsman and sculptor; Invited Artist at Royal West of England Academy"]}, {"page": "James Castle", "response": ["James Castle may refer to:", "* James Castle (politician) (1836\u20131903), U.S. Representative from Minnesota", "* James Castle (sculptor) (born 1946), Scottish sculptor", "* James Castle, title designer for Castle Bryant Johnsen"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* James Castle (sculptor)"]}, {"page": "Fleisher-Ollman Gallery", "response": ["Fleisher/Ollman Gallery is a U.S. art gallery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It opened in 1952 as the Janet Fleisher Gallery and remained as such for over thirty years. The gallery established a reputation as one of the world\u2019s premiere sources for self-taught art, defining the field and helping to develop major public and private collections of this once-marginalized group of artists. Fleisher/Ollman was among the first to mount major exhibitions of work by Henry Darger, Sister Gertrude Morgan, Bill Traylor, and Martin Ramirez, and we published early catalogues on James Castle, William Edmondson, and Joseph Yoakum. Since 1997, the gallery's emphasis has shifted toward the exhibition of contemporary artists who reflect the influence of the intuitive practice, such as Anthony Campuzano and Tristin Lowe."]}]}}
