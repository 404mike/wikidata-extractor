He took part in the 1891 FA Cup Final for Notts County (scoring their goal in a 3\u20131 defeat to Blackburn Rovers). During his career he also played in Scotland for Third Lanark and St Bernard's, winning the Scottish Cup with both clubs either side of his spell in England, in 1889 and 1895. He also spent four years with Rangers (1895 to 1899), during which time they claimed two Scottish Cups and a Scottish Football League title, but Oswald was a reserve and his involvement in these wins was minimal. He then finished his career at Morton.Oswald made three appearances for Scotland (scoring once) between 1894 and 1896. He also represented the Scottish Football League XI three times.His younger brother John Oswald was also a footballer; both siblings (who were born in Greenock but relocated to the Gorbals area of Glasgow with their family when very young), played together in the 1889 Scottish Cup Final, then moved to England to play for Notts County.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Bernard's F.C.", "response": ["* Jimmy Oswald"]}, {"page": "1860s in association football", "response": ["* 3 January \u2013 Jimmy Oswald (d. 1948), Scotland international in three matches (1889\u20131897)."]}, {"page": "List of Rangers F.C. international footballers", "response": ["| Jimmy Oswald ||align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"| 20 March 1897  ||align=\"center\"|1"]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (1872\u20131914)", "response": ["|Neil Munro, Jimmy Oswald, James McLaren||10,000 ||"]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Jimmy Oswald"]}, {"page": "1896\u201397 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Jimmy Oswald"]}, {"page": "James Oswald", "response": ["*Jimmy Oswald (1868\u20131948), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Jack Southworth", "response": ["Blackburn reached the FA Cup Final again in 1891.
