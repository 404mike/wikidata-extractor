He coined the binomial name Edolius ludwigii. The specific epithet was chosen to honour the German botanist Baron von Ludwig who collected plants in South Africa   between 1805 and 1847. It is now placed with the other drongos in the genus Dicrurus that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. Based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2018, the taxonomy of the square-tailed drongo complex was reorganised. Sharpe's drongo which had previously been treated as a subspecies of Dicrurus ludwigii was promoted to species rank becoming Dicrurus sharpei. But those birds previously in Dicrurus ludwigii sharpei occurring between Senegal and the Niger River were considered as a separate species, the western square-tailed drongo (Dicrurus occidentalis). The English name for Dicrurus ludwigii was changed from the \"square-tailed drongo\" to the \"common square-tailed drongo\"."]}, {"page": "Carcharodon", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Andrew Smith (zoologist)"]}, {"page": "Prideaux John Selby", "response": ["His collections were sold in 1885 and became dispersed.
