P.' Hurding on drums, and Lora Logic (born Susan Whitby) on saxophone. This last instrument was an atypical addition to the standard punk instrumental line-up, and became one of the group's most distinctive features.  Logic played on only one of the band's records.  As she was only fifteen, playing saxophone was a hobby and she left the band to complete her education.", "X-Ray Spex's other distinctive musical element was Poly Styrene's voice, which has been variously described as \"effervescently discordant\" and \"powerful enough to drill holes through sheet metal\".  As Mari Elliot, Styrene had released a reggae single for GTO Records in 1976, \"Silly Billy\", which had not charted. Born in 1957 in Bromley, Kent, of both Somali and British parentage, Poly Styrene became the group's public face, and remains one of the most memorable front-women to emerge from the punk movement. Unorthodox in appearance, she wore thick braces on her teeth and once stated that \"I said that I wasn't a sex symbol and that if anybody tried to make me one I'd shave my head tomorrow\". She later actually did at Johnny Rotten's flat prior to a concert at Victoria Park. Mark Paytress recounts in the liner notes for the 2002 compilation, The Anthology, that Jah Wobble, Rotten's longtime friend and bassist for his post-punk venture PiL, once described Styrene as a \"strange girl who often talked of hallucinating. She freaked John out.\"Cinderella's Big Score:  Women of the Punk and Indie Underground by Maria Raha Rotten, known more for his outspoken dislikes and disdain than for praise and admiration, said of X-Ray Spex in a retrospective punk documentary, \"Them, they came out with a sound and attitude and a whole energy\u2014it was just not relating to anything around it\u2014superb.\"", "On 30 April 1978, the band appeared at the Rock Against Racism gig at Victoria Park, Bow, Tower Hamlets. Also on the bill were Steel Pulse, The Clash, The Ruts, Sham 69, Generation X and Tom Robinson Band. Later in the year, to promote the album, X-Ray Spex embarked on their first, and only, full UK tour. Exhausted by touring, Poly Styrene left the band in mid 1979. Footage of her performing with the band was later included in the 1980 film, DOA. She released a solo album, Translucence, before joining the Hare Krishna movement (as did Logic, after she left the band).", "In 1991, X-Ray Spex reformed for a surprise sell-out gig at the Brixton Academy, where Poly appeared in a blue foam dress with an army helmet (to her regret). The group reformed again in 1995 with a line-up of Styrene, Dean and Logic to release a new album Conscious Consumer. Although heralded as the first in a trilogy, the album was not a commercial success. Styrene later explained  that touring and promotional work suffered an abrupt end when she was run over by a fire engine in central London, suffering a fractured pelvis. The following year X-Ray Spex played at the 20th Anniversary of Punk Festival in Blackpool minus Poly Styrene, overcoming her last-minute decision to withdraw by recruiting a replacement female singer named Poly Filla. The band disbanded, but later releases include a compilation of the group's early records, a live album, and an anthology of all the aforementioned.", "On 28 April 2008, Poly Styrene gave a performance of \"Oh Bondage Up Yours!\" in front of more than 10,000 people at the Love Music Hate Racism free concert in Victoria Park, East London", "The band including original bass player Paul Dean, played what was described as a raucous comeback gig and in front of an audience of 3,000 full at The Roundhouse in London on 6 September 2008. The gig consisted of Germfree Adolescents in its entirety, with the exception of \"Plastic Bag\". A DVD and CD of the Roundhouse performance was released in November 2009 on the Year Zero Label by Future Noise Music.

The documentary was directed by Paul Sng and was co-written by Styrene's daughter Celeste Bell (who also narrates) and author Zo\u00eb Howe. The documentary comes in conjunction with the 40-year anniversary Germfree Adolescents. Bell said \"This film will be a celebration of the life and work of my mother, an artist who deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest front women of all time; a little girl with a big voice whose words are more relevant than ever\".
