Throughout his career Bower\u2019s work spanned radio plays, television shows, propaganda shorts, animations and feature films, with his most notable projects consisting of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s first film in sound Blackmail (1929), the British Broadcasting Company\u2019s radio play Julius Caesar (1938), the Dunkirk evacuation propaganda short Channel Incident (1940), the feature film Henry V (1944), and an Anglo-French adaptation of Lewis Carroll's children's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland entitled Alice au pays des merveilles (1949). He later produced some of the earliest British television commercials.\nThe majority of Bower\u2019s work has been lost over time, due to both degradation and the purposeful melting down of the cellulose nitrate prints to extract small amounts of silver during the Second World war, leading to the placement of some of Bower\u2019s projects in the British Film Institute's 75 Most Wanted lost films.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry V (1944 film)", "response": ["Henry V is a 1944 British Technicolor Epic  film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same title.
