It was assumed that Coastal Command was to keep sea communications open for merchant shipping and prevent seaborne raids on British coastlines and ports. No mention of U-boats was made by either man. Both apparently assumed aircraft and surface raiders presented the greater threat in British waters, thus following the then Admiralty line that U-boats were no longer a threat.Hendrie 2006, p. 64. When Admiral Sir Dudley Pound enquired about aerial assets in trade and commerce defence, Chief of the Air Staff Cyril Newall, 1st Baron Newall, replied that there was not enough \"jam\" [resources] to go around and stated it was more advisable to risk losses on trade routes than weaken the RAF's ability to protect Britain from air attack and bomb its enemies.Hendrie 2006, pp. 64\u201365.", "thumb|right|Frederick Bowhill was the longest serving C-in-C, serving three years and ten months.", "| Air Marshal Sir Frederick Bowhill || 18 August 1937 || 14 June 1941"]}, {"page": "Royal Naval Air Service", "response": ["* Frederick Bowhill \u2013 Squadron commander in Wing 2, later Commander-in-chief Transport Command RAF.

Leigh persisted in his efforts to test the idea, and garnered the support of the Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, Sir Frederick Bowhill. In March 1941 a Vickers Wellington DWI that conveniently already had the necessary generator on board, (it had been used for anti-magnetic mining operations using a large electromagnet) was modified with a retractable \"dustbin\" holding the lamp, and proved the concept sound."]}, {"page": "RAF Iraq Command", "response": ["*9 March 1928 Group Captain (later Air Commodore) F W Bowhill (as Senior Air Staff Officer)Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation - Frederick Bowhill"]}, {"page": "Raid on Cuxhaven", "response": ["The Zeppelin sheds at the Nordholz Airbase near Cuxhaven were out of range of UK-based aircraft, so a plan was developed for the seaplane tenders , (Squadron-commander Cecil Malone, who was also air commander for the raid)  (Lieutenant E.
