In 1824 he was registered as lawyer at the Scottish bar. In October 1824 he inherited the title \"Baron Carlyle of Torthorwald\".\nFrom 1830 on, he came in contact with the Scottish reverend Edward Irving and was named \"apostle\" of the Catholic Apostolic Church on 1 May 1835. He took responsibility for Northern Germany.\nIn the 1830s, \"Thomas Carlyle, advocate\" is listed as living at 62 Cumberland Street in Edinburgh's New Town.He is not to be confused with the better-known man of letters Thomas Carlyle, born a few years earlier also in Dumfriesshire. He too was connected to Irving, who introduced him to his wife, Jane Welsh. One biographer asserts that the similarities did cause confusion: \"As a 'double-goer', perplexing strangers in foreign parts as well as at home, the 'Apostle' was occasionally an innocent, inadvertent nuisance to 'our Tom'.\"This Thomas Carlyle (lawyer) was the author of the book Shall Turkey Live or Die?

In his book On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History (1841), he argued that the actions of the \"Great Man\" play a key role in history, claiming that \"the history of the world is but the biography of great men\". Other major works include The French Revolution: A History, 3 vols (1837) and The History of Friedrich II of Prussia, Called Frederick the Great, 6 vols (1858\u201365).", "A noted polemicist, Carlyle coined the term \"the dismal science\" for economics, in his essay \"Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question\", which satirically advocated for the reintroduction of slavery to the West Indies to highlight his perceived hypocrisy of British abolitionists' indifference to domestic child-labour and slave-like working conditions in contemporary factories. John Carey in \"The truculent genius of Thomas Carlyle\", a review in Books and Bookmen in 1983, says: \"The standard view, which is that Carlyle was so poisonous it's a wonder his mind didn't infect his bloodstream.\"  On Carlyle's attitude to slavery he adds: \"Carlyle was a racist, with a rare talent for misreading historical trends.\" Likewise, Charles Darwin, in his autobiography, called his views of slavery \"Revolting. In his eyes might was right.\"", "thumb|left|Birthplace of Thomas Carlyle, Ecclefechan", "Carlyle was born in 1795 in Ecclefechan in Dumfriesshire. His parents determinedly afforded him an education at Annan Academy, Annan, where he was bullied and tormented so much that he left after three years.

The Carlyle Country, with a Study of Carlyle's Life. London: Chapman & Hall, p. 40. In early life, he was powerfully influenced by the strong Calvinist beliefs prevalent in his family and his nation.", "After attending the University of Edinburgh, Carlyle became a mathematics teacher, first in Annan and then in Kirkcaldy, where he became close friends with the mystic Edward Irving.

They moved to the main house of Jane's modest agricultural estate at Craigenputtock, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He often wrote about his life at Craigenputtock \u2013 in particular: \"It is certain that for living and thinking in I have never since found in the world a place so favourable.\" Here Carlyle wrote some of his most distinguished essays and began a lifelong friendship with the American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson.", "thumb|upright|right|Watercolour sketch of Thomas Carlyle, age 46, by Samuel Laurence", "thumb|upright|Thomas Carlyle in 1854", "Carlyle had a number of would-be romances before he married Jane Welsh, an important literary figure in her own right. The most notable were with Margaret Gordon, a pupil of his friend Edward Irving. Even after he met Jane, he became enamoured of Kitty Kirkpatrick, the daughter of a British officer and a Mughal princess. William Dalrymple, author of White Mughals, suggests that feelings were mutual, but social circumstances made the marriage impossible, as Carlyle was then poor. Both Margaret and Kitty have been suggested as the original of \"Blumine\", Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's beloved, in Sartor Resartus.Heffer, Simon (1995). Moral Desperado \u2013 A Life of Thomas Carlyle. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p. 48", "Carlyle would have preferred that no biography of him was written, but when he heard that his wishes would not be respected and several people were waiting for him to die before they published, he relented and supplied his friend James Anthony Froude with many of his and his wife's papers. Carlyle's essay about his wife was included in Reminiscences, published shortly after his death by Froude, who also published the Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle annotated by Carlyle himself. Froude's Life of Carlyle was published over 1882\u201384. The frankness of this book was unheard of by the usually respectful standards of 19th-century biographies of the period.Dunn, Waldo Hilary (1930).

However, the biography in question was consistent with Carlyle's own conviction that the flaws of heroes should be openly discussed, without diminishing their achievements. Froude, who had been designated by Carlyle himself as his biographer-to-be, was acutely aware of this belief. Froude's defence of his decision, My Relations With Carlyle, was published posthumously in 1903, including a reprint of Carlyle's 1873 will, in which Carlyle equivocated: \"Express biography of me I had really rather that there should be none.\" Nevertheless, Carlyle in the will simultaneously and completely deferred to Froude's judgment on the matter, whose \"decision is to be taken as mine.\"\"Will and Codicil of Thomas Carlyle, Esq.\", in My Relations with Carlyle, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, p. 73.", "Thomas Carlyle is notable both for his continuation of older traditions of the Tory satirists of the 18th century in England and for forging a new tradition of Victorian era criticism of progress known as sage writing.Holloway, John (1953).
