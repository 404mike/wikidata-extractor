This understanding changed in 1995 when Edward Witten suggested that the five theories were just special limiting cases of an eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory. Witten's conjecture was based on the work of a number of other physicists, including Ashoke Sen, Chris Hull, Paul Townsend, and Michael Duff. His announcement led to a flurry of research activity now known as the second superstring revolution.Duff", "Although there were only a handful of consistent superstring theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation. However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways. They found that a system of strongly interacting strings can, in some cases, be viewed as a system of weakly interacting strings. This phenomenon is known as S-duality. It was studied by Ashoke Sen in the context of heterotic strings in four dimensions and by Chris Hull and Paul Townsend in the context of the type IIB theory. Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.Duff, p. 67"]}, {"page": "Ramond\u2013Ramond field", "response": ["It is often convenient to use the democratic formulation of type II string theories, which was introduced by Paul Townsend in p-Brane Democracy.  In D-brane Wess-Zumino Actions, T-duality and the Cosmological Constant Michael Green, Chris Hull and Paul Townsend constructed the field strengths and found the gauge transformations that leave them invariant.  Finally in New Formulations of D=10 Supersymmetry and D8-O8 Domain Walls the authors completed the formulation, providing a Lagrangian and explaining the role of the fermions.  In this formulation one includes all of the even field strengths in IIA and all of the odd field strengths in IIB.  The additional field strengths are defined by the star condition Gp=*G10\u2212p.  As a consistency check, notice that the star condition is compatible with the self-duality of G5, thus the democratic formulation contains the same number of degrees of freedom as the original formulation.  Similarly to attempts to simultaneously include both electric and magnetic potentials in electromagnetism, the dual gauge potentials may not be added to the democratically formulated Lagrangian in a way that maintains the manifest locality of the theory.  This is because the dual potentials are obtained from the original potentials by integrating the star condition."]}, {"page": "Chris Hull (physicist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Hull"]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (C)", "response": ["*Chris Hull"]}]}}
