The transfer fee was \u00a380,000. Morrison made his debut in a 2\u20131 victory against Colchester United in October 1998. Morrison headed in City's second goal of the game and received a man of the match award, which was presented to him by former City winger Dennis Tueart. Morrison also scored in his second game for City, a 3\u20130 victory against Oldham Athletic. Morrison endeared himself to the City fans and was soon made captain. He scored his third goal for City in a 1\u20131 draw with Luton Town. One fanzine asked: \"Where can we get another half-dozen Andy Morrisons?\" According to goalkeeper Nicky Weaver: \"Morrison was a huge signing for us. Joe made him captain straight away. He was an intimidating figure for the opposition and he could be intimidating as a team-mate as well. I'd stand behind him in the tunnel and he'd be beating his chest, ready for battle. The other team would be thinking, 'I don't fancy tangling with him today'. But to be fair to Andy, he wasn't just a brute and growling pitbull. He had a great touch, too.\" In an 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon, in the FA Cup, Morrison was sent off after a scuffle with Carl Cort. Morrison scored his fourth goal of the season, via a thundering header from a corner, in a 6\u20130 victory against Burnley (Shaun Goater scored a hat trick and Kevin Horlock and Danny Allsopp scored the other goals). City finished in the play-off places in the league. Morrison captained City to victory over Gillingham in the 1999 Football League Second Division play-off Final at Wembley in May 1999.  In the match Morrison's teammates Kevin Horlock and Paul Dickov scored late goals to take the match to extra time and penalties (which City won). Morrison was presented with the playoff trophy at the end of the game and became the fifth City captain (following Sam Cowan, Roy Paul, Tony Book and Mike Doyle) to lift a trophy at Wembley. He has been succeeded, in this respect, by Carlos Tevez (who captained City to victory in the 2011 FA Cup Final) and Vincent Kompany (who has won the EFL Cup four times with City), although they captained City to victories at the new Wembley Stadium."]}, {"page": "Archbishop Tenison's School", "response": ["* Carl Cort, footballer"]}, {"page": "Leon Cort", "response": ["Leon Terence Anthony Cort (born 11 September 1979) is a former footballer who played as a defender.
