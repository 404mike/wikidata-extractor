After spending time as a banker and teacher in London and Sussex, he came to national attention for his botanical articles and books, and was renowned for his landscape gardening work in Brighton during its period of rapid growth.  In the 1820s he became involved in several major schemes in the town and neighbouring Hove, encompassing gardens, conservatories and similar.

Proving who was responsible for particular buildings or projects is difficult and sometimes contradictory because many designs were signed \"Wilds and Busby\", the three men carried out individual works simultaneously, and Wilds junior established his own independent company as well after 1823. Although he still had some involvement with his father and Busby's work, his own projects took up more of his time over the next 25 years: Oriental Place, Sillwood Place, Hanover Crescent, Park Crescent, the Royal Newburgh Assembly Rooms and the Royal Albion Hotel all still exist and are listed buildings. The Anthaeum, a gigantic dome-shaped conservatory he designed for Henry Phillips in 1832\u201333, collapsed the day before its scheduled opening; Wilds had resigned from the project before its completion because the building contractor was taking risks with the structural integrity of the building.", "Oriental Place and Sillwood Place are the remaining parts of an ambitious scheme for which Wilds junior was hired in 1825 by a horticulturalist and landscape gardener, Henry Phillips, who had designed Kemp Town's enclosed gardens.  He proposed an Oriental-style garden with a tall, steam-heated glasshouse called the Athenaeum, a library, museum and school, all surrounded by high-class houses. Wilds junior started building two north-south terraces accordingly, but Phillips' money ran out and he abandoned the project.  A local magistrate bought the land in 1827 and asked Wilds junior to finish the work.  Sillwood Place was built on the proposed Athenaeum site.

Conceived on a grand scale and consisting of a gigantic cupola-topped dome covering more than , the structure was intended to enclose a carefully landscaped tropical garden, with exotic trees and shrubs, lakes, rockeries and other attractions. The scheme was a larger and more ambitious version of a project Phillips and Wilds had worked on in 1825 in Hove's larger neighbour Brighton, for which money had run out before work could commence. Unlike its predecessor, the Anthaeum was built: work began in 1832 and an opening ceremony was planned for 31 August 1833.  Disagreements between the architect, the project engineer and the building contractor led to structural problems being overlooked or ignored, though, and the day before it opened the Anthaeum collapsed spectacularly.  Its wreckage stayed for nearly 20 years overlooking Adelaide Crescent, a seafront residential set-piece whose northern side it adjoined, and Phillips went blind from the shock of watching the largest of his many projects end in disaster.  Palmeira Square, another residential development, has occupied the site since the late 19th century.", "==Henry Phillips, Amon Henry Wilds and their early works==", "Amon Henry Wilds and Henry Phillips were Sussex-born men whose professional paths crossed regularly in the 1820s, when they had both moved to the rapidly growing seaside resort of Brighton. Wilds, baptised at Lewes in 1790, trained as an architect, town planner and engineer alongside his father Amon Wilds. They relocated to Brighton in 1815  and worked on various building projects. Phillips, born in Henfield in 1779, abandoned banking and teaching careers to become a botanist and horticultural writer\u2014interests which led him towards landscape gardening and the design of building schemes based around parks and gardens.  In 1822, the two men collaborated on the laying out and landscaping of The Level, a large area of open ground at the north end of Brighton. In 1825, they proposed an ambitious scheme for an open-ended residential square on Brighton seafront, the northern end of which would be occupied by \"an oriental garden and a huge conservatory known as the Athenaeum\". Money ran out before the gardens and conservatory could be built, although the residential terraces were eventually completed.", "As construction continued through the summer of 1833, temporary scaffolding held up the roof. Henry Phillips decided to ask civil engineer Sir John Rennie for advice on whether this could safely be removed. On 29 August 1833, two days before the Anthaeum's public unveiling, English removed the structure anyway. This may have been because he was angry at the implicit criticism of his workmanship\u2014although Rennie decided not to visit Hove and inspect the structure after hearing Phillips' description of the situation. The lack of any structural support meant that the ribs, which were meant to sit exactly opposite each other, started to bend out of alignment, eventually ending up several degrees askew and pulling the upper circular junction into an ellipse shape. English expected that the pressure could be supported by the terrace and observatory, but this did not happen. Just an hour after he removed the last section of scaffolding on 30 August 1833, the structure started to crack. All of the builders left, and only the head gardener stayed. A second much louder crack forced him to run outside and jump over a wall; the building, which weighed an estimated 400\u2013500 tons, immediately collapsed and embedded itself in the ground. The shock of the disaster made 54-year-old Phillips go blind; he never recovered his sight."]}, {"page": "Palmeira Square", "response": ["The land was originally occupied by \"the world's largest conservatory\", the Anthaeum\u2014a visitor attraction planned by botanist, author and building promoter Henry Phillips.  The giant dome's collapse and total destruction on the day it was due to open in 1833 made Phillips go blind from shock, and the debris occupied the site for many years.  Work began in the early 1850s and was largely complete in the mid-1860s, although commercial and residential buildings such as Palmeira House and Gwydyr Mansions continued to be added at the northern end throughout the late 19th century.  English Heritage has listed the residential buildings on the western, eastern and northern sides of the square at Grade II for their architectural and historical importance, although one building has the higher Grade II* status because of its opulent custom-designed interior.", "Rev. Thomas Scutt, who owned the Wick Estate land by the 1820s, started to sell plots of land to \"capitalis[e] on the insatiable demand for building land along the seafront\".  Brunswick Town was the first result of this, and when Sir Isaac Goldsmid, 1st Baronet, bought the rest of the land (over ) in 1830 he continued Hove's residential expansion by commissioning Decimus Burton to design Adelaide Crescent and by agreeing to fund the construction of \"the world's largest dome\" at its northern end.  The ostentatious Anthaeum, proposed by botanist and horticultural writer Henry Phillips and designed by prominent local architect Amon Henry Wilds, was to have been a vast circular conservatory containing exotic plants and trees.  It was built between 1832 and 1833 but collapsed spectacularly the day before its scheduled opening date, making Phillips go blind from shock and apparently distressing Goldsmid so much that he abandoned any further plans for development of his land for 20 years\u2014during which time the wrecked glass and iron structure lay where it fell at the north end of the incomplete Adelaide Crescent."]}, {"page": "Adelaide Crescent", "response": ["At the same time, the Anthaeum was being built immediately to the north.  This grandiose project was conceived by botanist, landscape gardener and writer Henry Phillips in conjunction with architect Amon Henry Wilds.  Under the world's largest dome would be a  tropical garden filled with exotic shrubs, flowers, birds and fish. Construction work took place in 1832\u201333, but the builders removed a supporting pillar crucial to the design and took away temporary scaffolding holding up the glazed dome.  On its opening day in 1833, the structure spectacularly collapsed, shocking Phillips so much he went blind. The wreckage lay where it fell for the next 20 years. After the disaster there was a long delay in building work on Adelaide Crescent, and Burton's semicircular design was abandoned; Goldsmid, who gave land and money towards the Anthaeum scheme, may have lost enthusiasm for the project, although there is no firm evidence for the cause of the delay. Brighton and Hove were suffering a downturn by the 1830s, though: the popular Prince Regent, a regular visitor to Brighton, had died and his brother King William IV only occasionally visited; the fashionable status of the towns had temporarily declined; and the surge in popularity associated with the coming of the railways was still several years away.  Even the original ten houses were not complete and occupied, and \"the skeletons of [the] unfinished houses presented a dreary sight\" beyond the wreckage of the Anthaeum. By this time, the partly built crescent stood at the extreme west end of a nearly unbroken line of buildings along the seafront all the way to Kemp Town, about  to the east. To the west, there was little development until the Cliftonville estate was laid out in the 1870s and 1880s."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Kent (writer)", "response": ["Her best known work, Flora Domestica, quoting extensively from Hunt and Keats,D.

Thereafter, apart from  of downland near Brighton Racecourse, far out of town on top of Race Hill, The Level was the only area of common land available to the town's residents. In the same year Union Road was built to connect the Ditchling and Lewes Roads, marking the northern edge of the Level, and the land to the north of it was sold. Local entrepreneur James Ireland established the Royal Gardens on this section, but the venture failed and the land was later sold again; Park Crescent was built on it from 1849. Also in 1822, the Level itself was designed and laid out by architect Amon Henry Wilds and horticulturist Henry Phillips. The elm trees, a gift to the town from Henry Pelham, 3rd Earl of Chichester, were planted in November 1844. Many were uprooted in the Great Storm of 1987, although at the time Brighton Borough Council was considering felling many of them because of an outbreak of Dutch elm disease."]}]}}
