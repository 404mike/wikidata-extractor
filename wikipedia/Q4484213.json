After spending time as a banker and teacher in London and Sussex, he came to national attention for his botanical articles and books, and was renowned for his landscape gardening work in Brighton during its period of rapid growth.  In the 1820s he became involved in several major schemes in the town and neighbouring Hove, encompassing gardens, conservatories and similar.  His grandiose Anthaeum project, an elaborate indoor botanical garden topped by \"the largest dome in the world\", ended in disaster when the structure spectacularly collapsed just before its official opening.", "link_mentions": {}}}
