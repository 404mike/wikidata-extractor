Lord Justice MacKinnon wrote that:Mr. Justice J. C. Lawrance was a stupid man, a very ill-equipped lawyer, and a bad judge. He was not the worst judge I have appeared before: that distinction I would assign to Mr. Justice Ridley [another Conservative MP controversially elevated by Halsbury]. Ridley had much brains than Lawrance, but he had a perverse instinct for unfairness that Lawrance could never approach. It is perhaps not without significance that Lawrance and Ridley both failed to get admission to the modern Valhalla, the Dictionary of National Biography.\"However, Lawrance had his defenders, especially from the criminal bar. Frederic Holman and Sir Travers Humphreys both praised him for his common sense, while Ernest Bowen-Rowlands KC said that on circuit he was \"a good judge and in crime one of the best judges I have practiced before\". The Times commented that:In the conduct of a trial with a jury he was usually patient and reasonable, and as a Criminal Judge he appears to have had no prepossession either towards undue severity or a flabby leniency. In this respect he was a satisfactory Judge, but he was hardly equal to a sustained course of reasoning or to the interpretation of intricate Acts of Parliament. In case involving these he was generally content simply to express his concurrence with a senior colleague, or in revenue cases to decide in favour of the Crown.Lawrance was personally well-liked: he was said to possess \"an unostentatious sense of humour and a commendable gift of reticence\". Another otherwise critical account credited him with \"prudence and self-restraint, and is irreproachable in word and act, and is, in fact, liked and admired for many qualities.\" On his retirement, The Law Journal commented that although this \"has not seriously reduced the judicial store of erudition, it has deprived the King's Bench Division of one of its most attractive personalities.\" Lawrance was nicknamed \"Long Lawrance\", both in reference to his height (he was said to be the tallest judge on the bench) and to distinguish him from A.
