He was Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy at Trinity College Dublin (1831-1843) and much later Provost (1867\u20131881). Lloyd is known for experimentally verifying conical refraction, a theoretical prediction made by William Rowan Hamilton about the way light is bent when travelling through a biaxial crystal. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and President of both the British Association and the Royal Irish Academy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Augustin-Jean Fresnel", "response": ["Fresnel had a lifelong battle with tuberculosis, to which he succumbed at the age of 39.  Although he did not become a public celebrity in his lifetime, he lived just long enough to receive due recognition from his peers, including (on his deathbed) the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of London, and his name is ubiquitous in the modern terminology of optics and waves. After the wave theory of light was subsumed by Maxwell's electromagnetic theory in the 1860s, some attention was diverted from the magnitude of Fresnel's contribution. In the period between Fresnel's unification of physical optics and Maxwell's wider unification, a contemporary authority, Humphrey Lloyd, described Fresnel's transverse-wave theory as \"the noblest fabric which has ever adorned the domain of physical science, Newton's system of the universe alone excepted.\"", "Thus a new pair of phenomena, qualitatively different from anything previously observed or suspected, had been predicted by mathematics as consequences of Fresnel's theory. The prompt experimental confirmation of those predictions by Humphrey Lloyd brought Hamilton a prize that had never come to Fresnel: immediate fame."]}, {"page": "Trinity College Dublin", "response": ["* Humphrey Lloyd (physicist)"]}, {"page": "Richard Whately", "response": ["Humphrey Lloyd told Caroline Fox that Whately's eccentric behaviour and body language was exacerbated in Dublin by a sycophantic circle of friends.

In 1880, while Humphrey Lloyd was provost, Samuel Haughton, Anthony Traill, John Jellett and others proposed that degrees be open to women, on the same terms as men. Lloyd, as provost, was not a supporter, and the motion was defeated. In 1881, Jellett became provost, and committee was set up in 1882 to investigate the matter, including future provosts Salmon and Trail, respectively opposing and supporting admission. Despite the support of the provost, the committee was not effective."]}, {"page": "Dip circle", "response": ["Early dip circles were not accurate and gave poor results.  Over the next 300 years many improvements were made, including reducing the friction between the needle and its pivot and encasing the circle in glass.  Between the late 18th century and late 19th century the design approached its peak. Improvements which made the dip circle a practical aid for polar navigation were made by Robert Were Fox FRS, who developed in the 1830s the first dip circle that could be used on board a moving ship. Another important improvement to the instrument was developed in the 1830s by the Dublin physicist Humphrey Lloyd, who devised a way of attaching a magnetic needle at right-angles to the dip needle in order to measure the intensity of force (by seeing the extent to which the right-angle needle deflected the dip-needle)."]}, {"page": "Lloyd's mirror", "response": ["Lloyd's mirror is an optics experiment that was first described in 1834 by Humphrey Lloyd in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy. Its original goal was to provide further evidence for the wave nature of light, beyond those provided by Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel. In the experiment, light from a monochromatic slit source reflects from a glass surface at a small angle and appears to come from a virtual source as a result. The reflected light interferes with the direct light from the source, forming interference fringes.Fresnel's and Lloyd's Mirrors It is the optical wave analogue to a sea interferometer."]}, {"page": "List of provosts of Trinity College Dublin", "response": ["|Humphrey Lloyd"]}, {"page": "Andrew Searle Hart", "response": ["He was elected Vice-Provost of TCD in 1876, and at this time undertook many of the duties of the then provost, Humphrey Lloyd, that ill health had permitted him from carrying out."]}, {"page": "Humphrey Lloyd", "response": ["Humphrey Lloyd may refer to:", "* Humphrey Lloyd (by 1498\u20131562 or later), Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire", "* Humphrey Lloyd (physicist) (1800\u20131881), provost of Trinity College, Dublin, 1867\u20131881", "* Humphrey Lloyd (bishop) (1610\u20131689), Bishop of Bangor, 1674\u20131689", "* Mount Humphrey Lloyd, a mountain in Victoria Land, Antarctica, named for the provost of Trinity College"]}, {"page": "St. Bride's Church, Dublin", "response": ["Many members of the Lloyd family of New Ross, two of whom (Bartholomew Lloyd (1772\u20131837) and his son Humphrey Lloyd) were provosts of Trinity College, Dublin, were baptized, married or buried in this church.

His father Thomas Boileau had moved to India in 1780 to work at the Supreme Court in Fort William. On his father's side his ancestors were Huguenots from N\u00eemes. His mother Leah was the daughter of Lt. Col. Ebenezer Jessup from New England. After the death of the father in 1806, the family moved to live in Bury St. Edmunds, England. After studying at the Grammar School, he received a cadetship at the East India Company Military Seminary at Addiscombe in 1819. His brother Henry joined in the next year. He received prizes in mathematics and Hindustani and was gazetted in 1821 and sent for training to Chatham with the Royal Engineers. He reached Calcutta on 22 September 1822 and then on to Kanpur. He was involved in road building at Jabalpur and between Nagpur and Kamptee. In 1826 he became garrison engineer at Agra, designing the St George Church, the jail, a college, and barracks. In 1829 he married Ann, daughter of Captain Hanson, and on the same day, his brother Henry married Ann's sister at St George's Church. Boileau was involved in reconstruction and repair of several Mughal constructions including Jahangir's palace, Fatehpur, and the Taj Mahal. The cost exceeded the estimates and when he wished to leave the East India Company on furlough in 1834, he was asked to pay thirty thousand rupees as outstanding expenses. In 1839, Boileau was assigned to set up a magnetic observatory at Simla after being trained by Professor Humphrey Lloyd of Trinity College, Dublin. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 5 March 1840 and later to the Royal Astronomical Society. While at Simla, he also designed the Christ Church and raised funds for its construction. In 1847 he became superintending engineer in the North West Provinces. He then moved to live at Ambala where weekend dinners included flute played by Boileau and piano by his wife Ann. He retired on 4 February 1856 with the rank of Major General, just before the mutiny. The family settled at Notting Hill and he began to work for the wives, widows, and children of soldiers then posted in large numbers in the Crimea. In 1860 he joined the 1st Middlesex Rifle volunteers. Punch magazine depicted a cartoon of him as \"Mr Buffles\" in 1862. A bust by Thomas Brock is now in the Kensington public library."]}, {"page": "School of Engineering (Trinity College Dublin)", "response": ["The School of Engineering was established in 1841 by Humphrey Lloyd. At that time, teaching was oriented towards civil engineering, geology, chemistry and mathematics. The original two-year course led to the award of a Diploma in Civil Engineering. The BAI (Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria) degree was introduced in 1872. A long-standing stipulation of the college was that graduates in professional subjects including engineering must first be Bachelors of Arts. As such, the BA degree was bestowed before the BAI degree at commencement ceremonies. That practice continues to this day, although students now take subjects in engineering science in place of arts subjects.", "The school celebrated its 175th Anniversary in November 2016.
