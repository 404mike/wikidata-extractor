Approximately 65 songs have survived. These works include settings for poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Adelaide A. Procter, Percy Bysshe Shelly, Alfred Tennyson, and many others.

He was in partnership with Charles Jefferys as a music-seller until 1843, when he was elected an associate of the Philharmonic Society.
