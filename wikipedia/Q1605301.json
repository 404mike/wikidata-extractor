Letters in support were written to the fledging Society by Frederick Leighton, then President of the Royal Academy, John Ruskin, Charles Dickens, John Everett Millais, and Auguste Rodin, amongst others. This Society achieved its Royal Charter granted by Queen Victoria in 1888 who bestowed on the President a gold chain of office, becoming the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and in 1898 this was enlarged to include Engravers.

Among those for whom he printed were Seymour Haden, Alphonse Legros, Whistler, and Samuel Palmer. In 1881 he felt justified in embarking upon a printing business of his own, and built a studio, largely extended later, in the garden at the back of Kingston House. Among artists whose etchings he printed were Frank Short, William Strang, Joseph Pennell, Auguste Rodin, Charles Holroyd, Paul Adolphe Rajon and Robert Walker Macbeth; in fact few etchers or engravers did not claim Goulding's assistance. In About Etching (1879), Haden described Goulding as \"the best printer of etchings in England just now\"."]}]}}
