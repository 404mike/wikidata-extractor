He mentored numerous Scottish magicians including Jerry Sadowitz, R. Paul Wilson and Peter Duffie.\nMany of Walton's pamphlets and other works have been collected in three books on card magic currently published by Lewis Davenport Ltd. of London, and he contributed to several English language magazines on card magic (e.g. Magic magazine and Genii magazine).\nHe lived and worked in Glasgow, Scotland for many years, and died there on 3 February 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Montmartre", "response": ["* Roy Walton, the English card magician, named a card trick Montmartre published in The Complete Walton Volume 1.
