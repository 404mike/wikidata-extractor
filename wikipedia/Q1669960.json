He specialises in the ancient Egyptian Ramesside Period (i.e., Dynasties 19-20), and the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt, as well as ancient Egyptian chronology, having written over 250 books and journal articles on these and other subjects since the mid-1950s. He has been described by The Times as \"the very architect of Egyptian chronology\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Moses", "response": ["An Egyptian root msy ('child of') has been considered as a possible etymology, arguably an abbreviation of a theophoric name, as for example in Egyptian names like Thutmoses ('child of Thoth') and Ramesses ('child of Ra'),Hays, Christopher B. 2014. Hidden Riches: A Sourcebook for the Comparative Study of the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near East. Presbyterian Publishing Corp. p. 116. with the god's name omitted. Abraham Yahuda, based on the spelling given in the Tanakh, argues that it combines \"water\" or \"seed\" and \"pond, expanse of water,\" thus yielding the sense of \"child of the Nile\" (mw-\u0161).Ulmer, Rivka. 2009. Egyptian Cultural Icons in Midrash. de Gruyter. p. 269. However, Kenneth Kitchen argued that an Egyptian origin for the name was unlikely, as the sounds in the Hebrew m-\u0161-h do not correspond to the pronunciation of Egyptian msy in the relevant time period.Kenneth A. Kitchen, On the Reliability of the Old Testament (2003), p.296-7: \"His name is widely held to be Egyptian, and its form is too often misinterpreted by biblical scholars. It is frequently equated with the Egyptian word \"ms\" (Mose) meaning \"child,\" and stated to be an abbreviation of a name compounded with that of a deity whose name has been omitted. And indeed we have many Egyptians called Amen-mose, Ptah-mose, Ra-mose, Hor-mose, and so on. But this explanation is wrong. We also have very many Egyptians who were actually called just \"Mose,\" without omission of any particular deity. Most famous because of his family's long lawsuit in the middle-class scribe Mose (of the temple of Ptah at Memphis), under Ramesses II; but he had many homonyms. So, the omission-of-deity explanation is to be dismissed as wrong... There is worse. The name of Moses is most likely not Egyptian in the first place! The sibilants do not match as they should, and this cannot be explained away. Overwhelmingly, Egyptian \"s\" appears as \"s\" (samekh) in Hebrew and West Semitic, while Hebrew and West Semitic \"s\" (samekh) appears as \"tj\" in Egyptian. Conversely, Egyptian \"sh\" = Hebrew \"sh,\" and vice versa. It is better to admit that the child was named (Exod 2:10b) by his own mother, in a form originally vocalized \"Mashu,\" \"one drawn out\" (which became \"Moshe,\" \"he who draws out,\" i.e., his people from slavery, when he led them forth). In fourteenth/thirteenth-century Egypt,\"Mose\" was actually pronounced \"Masu,\" and so it is perfectly possible that a young Hebrew Mashu was nicknamed Masu by his Egyptian companions; but this is a verbal pun, not a borrowing either way.\""]}, {"page": "Sabaeans", "response": ["The date of the foundation of Saba\u02be is a point of disagreement among scholars.

Already during Ramesses XI's reign, the Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt was losing its grip on the city of Thebes, whose priests were becoming increasingly powerful. After his death, his successor, Smendes I, ruled from the city of Tanis, but was mostly active only in Lower Egypt, which he controlled. Meanwhile, the High Priests of Amun at Thebes ruled Middle and Upper Egypt in all but name.Kenneth A. Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100\u2013650 BC), 3rd edition, 1986, Warminster: Aris & Phillips Ltd, p.531 However, this division was less significant than it seems, since both the priests and pharaohs came from the same family."]}, {"page": "Shebitku", "response": ["Kenneth Kitchen, however, observes that the \"verb xai (or appearance) applies to any official 'epiphany' or official manifestation of the king to his 'public appearances'.\"Kenneth A. Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100\u2013650 BC) [TIPE], 3rd edition, 1986, Warminster: Aris & Phillips Ltd, p.170 Kitchen also stresses that the period around the first month of Shemu days 1-5 marked the date of a Festival of Amun-Re at Karnak which is well attested during the New Kingdom Period, the 22nd Dynasty and through to the Ptolemaic period. Hence, in the third Year of Shebitku, this Feast to Amun evidently coincided with both the Inundation of the Nile and a personal visit by Shebitku to the Temple of Amun \"but we have no warrant whatever for assuming that Shebitku...remained uncrowned for 2 whole years after his accession.\"Kitchen, TIPE, p.171 William Murnane also endorsed this interpretation by noting that Shebitku's Year 3 Nile Text \"need not refer to an accession or coronation at all. Rather, it seems simply to record an 'appearance' of Shebitku in the temple of Amun during his third year and to acknowledge the god's influence in securing his initial appearance as king.\"Murnane, Coregencies, p.189 In other words, Shebitku was already king of Egypt and the purpose of his visit to Karnak was to receive and record for posterity the god Amun's official legitimization of his reign. Therefore, the evidence for a possible coregency between Shabaka and Shebitku is illusory at present."]}]}}
