Glyn Davies' contract as manager was cancelled by mutual consent and long serving club trainer Joe Sykes was temporarily appointed manager with Allchurch part of his selection committee. Sykes also handed the club captaincy to Allchurch, replacing Brian Purcell, but the club eventually suffered relegation to the Fourth Division at the end of the 1966\u201367 season. He remained with the club, entering the final year of his contract, but was switched to playing as a striker by manager Billy Lucas in order to lessen the amount of running required of Allchurch who had turned 38 during the opening months of the season. The change of position benefited him, scoring seventeen times in the league in forty matches. Approaching the end of the season, he was offered a one-year extension to his contract with the club, with a \u00a35 per week pay cut, but eventually decided to retire from professional football, making his final appearance on 6 May 1968 against Hartlepools United. He retired from professional football as Swansea's all-time record goalscorer.
