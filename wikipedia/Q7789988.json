Private Turrall remained with the wounded officer for three hours under continuous and heavy fire from machine-guns and bombs. Notwithstanding that both he and the officer were at one time completely cut off from the British troops, he held his ground with determination and finally carried the officer to the British lines after a counter-attack had made this possible.His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Worcestershire Regiment collections in the Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum, Worcester, England.", "link_mentions": []}}
