He played as centre forward.\nBorn in Wrockwardine, Shropshire, Billy Price's career started at local side Wrockwardine Wood, before he signed for Huddersfield Town. His Town career was interrupted by the Second World War but by the time he left for Reading two years after the war he had scored 23 goals from 51 games. After a short stay at Reading he had a shorter spell at Hull City, although he did manage five goals in just eight games.\nInstead he moved to Bradford City in October 1949, scoring a penalty in his second game, and finishing his first season as top goal-scorer with 12 league goals and four FA Cup goals including a hat-trick in a 9\u20130 rout of Fleetwood. Another 15 goals saw him finish as top goal-scorer again in 1950\u201351 before he left the following season after making just eight starts. His career took him to non-league Winsford United.", "link_mentions": {}}}
