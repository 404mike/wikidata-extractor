It rambles all over the place and is perilously uneven in its humorous attack. But it does offer several stinging sideswipes at the \"plutocrats, peers and parasites,\" and kids class distinctions and traditions in a pleasantly good-natured way. In the title role of the butler, Cecil Parker\u2014he who played the pompous colonel in the last episode of \"Quartet\"\u2014is delightfully foolish and mannered, but A. E. Matthews as the butler's ranking boss, a beautifully addle-brained old codger, runs away with the show. Mr. Matthews' illustration of the complacence of an impoverished earl may not be wholly consistent but it glistens brightly in spots. David Tomlinson also does nicely as the thoroughly light-weight young lord and Lana Morris, Tom Macaulay and Marjorie Fielding are amusing in other roles.\""]}, {"page": "The Long Dark Hall", "response": ["* Tom Macaulay - Ironworks manager "]}, {"page": "Murder at Scotland Yard", "response": ["* Tom Macaulay as Inspector Grant"]}, {"page": "The Chiltern Hundreds (play)", "response": ["*Mr Cleghorn -\tTom Macaulay"]}, {"page": "Tucker McGuire", "response": ["thumb|right|Tucker McGuireAnne Tucker McGuire (29 January 1913 in Winchester, Virginia, USA - 3 August 1988 in London, England) was an American-born actress who appeared largely in British films and television.
