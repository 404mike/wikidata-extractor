In June 1876, he played cricket for the school team against Eton College, which won the match with a team including cricketing luminaries Ivo Bligh and Kynaston Studd, as well as a future Principal Private Secretary at the Home Office Evelyn Ruggles-Brise. Druitt bowled out Studd for four.Leighton, p. 16 With a glowing academic record, he was awarded a Winchester Scholarship to New College, Oxford.Cullen, p. 225; Leighton, p. 20; McDonald, p. 82", "The theories attempted to link Druitt with Clarence, Gull and Stephen through a network of mutual acquaintances and possible connections. Reginald Acland, the brother of Gull's son-in-law, had legal chambers in King's Bench Walk near Druitt's,Knight, p. 140; Leighton, p. 70 as did Harry Stephen, who was James Stephen's brother. Harry Stephen was good friends with Harry Wilson, who had a house in Chiswick, \"The Osiers\", near to where Druitt's body was found.Leighton, pp. 70\u201371, 93; McDonald, p. 143 Wilson and James Stephen were close friends of Clarence, and were both members of an exclusive society called the Cambridge Apostles.Leighton, pp. 70\u201371 As a schoolboy, Druitt had played cricket against two of Wilson's friends, Kynaston Studd and Henry Goodhart, who was also one of the Apostles.Leighton, p. 74 Another potential connection between Druitt and Wilson is through John Henry Lonsdale. Lonsdale's name and Blackheath address are written in a diary belonging to Wilson now in the possession of Trinity College, Cambridge. Lonsdale's address is a few yards from the school at which Druitt worked and lived, and Lonsdale had been a barrister and had also rented legal chambers in King's Bench Walk. In 1887, Lonsdale entered the church and was assigned as curate to Wimborne Minster, where the Druitt family worshiped. Lonsdale and Macnaghten were classmates at Eton, and so theorists argue that Lonsdale might have been in a position to provide \"private information\" to Macnaghten regarding Druitt.Spallek, Andrew (November 2007) \"John Henry Lonsdale: A Possible Source of Macnaghten's 'Private Information'\", Ripperologist 85: 3\u201310 The connections between the Apostles and Druitt led to the suggestion that he was part of the same social set.Leighton, pp. 69\u201380 Druitt, his mother, and his sister Georgiana, were invited to a ball in honour of Clarence at the home of Lord Wimborne on 17 December 1888, although they did not attend because by that time Montague was dead, his mother was in an asylum, and his sister was expecting her second child.Leighton, p. 76 Clarence, Stephen, Wilson, Studd, and Goodhart are suggested to have been homosexual,Leighton, p. 71 although this is contested by historians.Bradford, Sarah (1989) King George VI, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, , p. 10; Hyde, p. 56 John Wilding's 1993 book Jack the Ripper Revealed used the connections between Druitt and Stephen to propose that they committed the crimes together, but reviewers considered it an \"imaginative tale\u00a0... most questionable\",Leighton, p. 157 an \"exercise in ingenuity rather than\u00a0... fact\",Whittington-Egan, Richard (April 1994), \"Book reviews\", Contemporary Review,  and \"lack[ing] evidential support\".Begg, The Facts, p. 513"]}, {"page": "Studd brothers", "response": ["*Kynaston Studd", "*Studd Trophy \u2013 an annual award named after Kynaston Studd"]}, {"page": "Charles Studd", "response": ["*Kynaston Studd"]}, {"page": "Peter Malden Studd", "response": ["Like his forebear Sir Kynaston Studd, he was a governor of the Regent Street Poly (now part of the University of Westminster).", "*Sir Kynaston Studd"]}, {"page": "Studd", "response": ["*Kynaston Studd (John Edward Kynaston 'JEK')  (1858\u20131944) \u2013 the eldest brother, cricketer and Lord Mayor of London."]}, {"page": "Priscilla Studd", "response": ["* Kynaston Studd"]}, {"page": "Harris Academy St John's Wood", "response": ["In September 1956, Quintin's next-door neighbour, Kynaston School, opened as a county comprehensive, named after Kynaston Studd, a former president of the Royal Polytechnic at Regent Street and Lord Mayor of London.

When Hogg died in 1903, he was succeeded as President by Sir Kynaston Studd (1858\u20131944), who remained in office until his death in 1944, and did much to continue the traditions of the founder. Two major appeals were launched to support expansion, the first for the rebuilding of 309 Regent Street in 1910\u20131912, and the second to build the Polytechnic Extension building for the Women's Institute in Little Titchfield Street, which was formally opened in 1929.

He did this very successfully, expanding the range of tours to include southern Europe but continuing to focus on Switzerland as the primary PTA destination. Kynaston Studd was PTA chairman until his death in 1944; Ronald Studd, as well as being PTA Managing Director, was on the Polytechnic Board of Governors.
