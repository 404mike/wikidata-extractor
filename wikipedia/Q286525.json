Referring to the songs recorded in the band's last session together (B-sides for the \"Girlfriend in a Coma\" single, which preceded the album's release), Marr said \"I wrote 'I Keep Mine Hidden', but 'Work Is a Four-Letter Word' I hated. That was the last straw, really. I didn't form a group to perform Cilla Black songs.\" In 1989, in an interview with young fan Tim Samuels (who later became a BBC journalist), Morrissey claimed the lack of a managerial figure and business problems were to blame for the band's eventual split. In a 2016 interview, Marr agreed with this."]}, {"page": "Burt Bacharach", "response": ["His music is characterized by unusual chord progressions, influenced by his background in jazz harmony, and uncommon selections of instruments for small orchestras. Most of Bacharach's and David's hits were written specifically for and performed by Dionne Warwick, but earlier associations (from 1957 to 1963) saw the composing duo work with Marty Robbins, Perry Como, Gene McDaniels, and Jerry Butler. Following the initial success of these collaborations, Bacharach went on to write hits for Gene Pitney, Cilla Black, Dusty Springfield, Jackie DeShannon, Bobbie Gentry, Tom Jones, Herb Alpert, B. J. Thomas, the Carpenters, among numerous other artists. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output."]}, {"page": "Cultural impact of the Beatles", "response": ["Through the Beatles' early success, the Lennon\u2013McCartney partnership revolutionised songwriting in Britain by usurping the Denmark Street tradition of in-house songwriters. In the US, they similarly inspired changes to the music industry, as did the British Invasion songwriters they influenced, by combining the roles of writer and performer. This trend threatened the Brill Building writers and other professional songwriters that dominated the American music industry. According to Rolling Stones editors, the Beatles thereby \"inaugurated the era of self-contained bands and forever centralized pop\". Lennon and McCartney also supplied hit songs for several other artists up to 1966, including Cilla Black, Billy J. Kramer, the Fourmost and the Rolling Stones, and they opened up opportunities in the US that were previously unavailable for non-performing British songwriters, such as Tony Hatch. Direct collaboration between Lennon and McCartney was limited from 1964, but their songs continued to be credited to the partnership."]}, {"page": "The 11 O'Clock Show", "response": ["In January 2000, the show came under criticism from the Broadcasting Standards Commission following viewer complaints about comments that were made on the show about recently deceased TV presenter Jill Dando, Bobby Willis (the husband of entertainer Cilla Black) and golfer Payne Stewart."]}, {"page": "Alison Moyet", "response": ["On 16 October 2013, Moyet appeared as a guest performer on ITV 1's The One and Only Cilla Black celebrating Cilla Black's 50 years in show business.

The Observer suggested that \"time hasn't diminished her perfect voice.\" Reviewing the release in The Guardian, Caroline Sullivan wrote: \"Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog has a vulnerability that gets under the skin of a song. She may be cheating a trifle by including no original material on this collection of 1960s covers, but if anyone can do justice to the likes of \"Sealed with a Kiss\", it's her. The soaring sentimentality evokes Cilla Black and Sandie Shaw in their mini-skirted pomp, and I don't say that lightly.\" The release attracted media attention across Europe, but F\u00e4ltskog staunchly refused to be involved in any extensive promotion of the album."]}, {"page": "Spitting Image", "response": ["Writer and MP Jeffrey Archer appeared as an annoying, self-commenting writer whose books were not read by anyone.

It worked, as The Big Night failed to beat The Generation Game and was off the air within three months."]}]}}
