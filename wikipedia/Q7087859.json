He was admitted to King's College, Cambridge (the same college as Alan Turing) in 1935 where he continued to neglect his studies. Strachey studied mathematics and then transferred to physics.

The Americans also constructed a replica machine to expedite solutions; this machine had two half-rotors to solve the vowels and consonants separately.
