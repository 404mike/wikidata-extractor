The series has Doctor Bong causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a mouse (as a parody of Mickey Mouse, in retaliation for the Disney-mandated redesign), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as Witchblade, Preacher and several others, with Howard ultimately having a conversation with God in Hell."]}, {"page": "Chuck Austen", "response": ["*411 #1: \"Blow Up\" (co-written by Austen and Bill Jemas, art by Phil Winslade, anthology, 2003)"]}, {"page": "Crisis (Fleetway)", "response": ["Art: Phil Winslade", "Art: Phil Winslade", "Art: Phil Winslade"]}, {"page": "Mark Millar", "response": ["*Revolver Horror Special: \"Mother's Day\" (with Phil Winslade, anthology, 1990)", "** \"One Enchanted Evening...\" (with Phil Winslade, co-feature in Day of Judgment Secret Files & Origins, 1999)"]}, {"page": "Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight", "response": ["By Christos N.
