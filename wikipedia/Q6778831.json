She is frequently mentioned in ballads.In 1584 the Spanish captured Ghent, and Captain Mary Ambree, along with several other Dutch and English volunteers, fought to liberate the city. It was said that she was avenging her lover, a sergeant major who died during the siege.\n\nShe was a popular subject of ballads during the 17th-century from 1620s onwards. Ambree was the subject of the English ballad that provided the title for Rudyard Kipling's well-known novel, Captains Courageous.  The ballad was preserved by Thomas Percy in the Pepys Collection.A female French Legionnaire in the book Sowing Glory by P.C.

Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1996 (pg. 47) Diane Dugaw reads the ballad in relation to other \"warrior women\" ballads, such as Mary Ambree, The Merchants Daughter of Bristol, The Valiant Commander, The Gallant She-Soldier, and The Famous Woman Drummer. According to Dugaw, each of these ballads combines love and glory, and highlights the woman's masquerade as a man as a key component in overcoming the threat of separation. Dugaw suggests that \"I Would Thou Wert in Shrewsbury\" is probably the same tune as the \"New Northern Tune\" of The Valiant Commander, arguing that this recycling of tunes also contributed to linking these ballads of women warriors together for contemporary audiences.Dugaw, pg. 47-8"]}, {"page": "History of transgender people in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*1584 - Mary Ambree, popularised in the ballads of the 1760s is noted for cross-dressing to join the navy", "File:Mary Ambree.jpg|Mary Ambree (1584)"]}]}}
