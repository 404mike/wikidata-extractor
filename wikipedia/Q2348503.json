In 1679 he sailed again as a surgeon, soon after settling in Jamaica to practise his profession.\nIn 1680, Wafer was recruited by buccaneer Edmund Cooke to join a privateering venture under the leadership of Captain Bartholomew Sharp, where he met William Dampier at Cartagena.After being injured during an overland journey, Wafer was left behind with four others in the Isthmus of Darien in Panama, where he stayed with the Cuna Indians.  He gathered information about their culture, including their shamanism and a short vocabulary of their language.  He studied the natural history of the isthmus.  The following year, Wafer left the Indians promising to return and marry the chief's sister and bring back dogs from England. He fooled the buccaneers at first as he was dressed as an Indian, wearing body-paint and ornamented with a nose-ring.  It took them some time to recognise him.Wafer reunited with Dampier, and after privateering with him on the Spanish Main until 1688, he settled in Philadelphia.\nBy 1690 Wafer was back in England and in 1695 he published A New Voyage and Description of the Isthmus of America, which described his adventures.  It was translated into French (1706), German (1759), and Swedish (1789).The Darien Company hired him as an adviser when it was planning its settlement on the isthmus in 1698.He died in London in 1705.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of explorers", "response": ["| Lionel Wafer"]}, {"page": "Darien scheme", "response": ["* Lionel Wafer"]}, {"page": "1695 in literature", "response": ["*Lionel Wafer \u2013 A New Voyage and Description of the Isthmus of America"]}, {"page": "William Paterson (banker)", "response": ["* Lionel Wafer, a buccaneer who had been marooned for four years on the isthmus of Dari\u00e9n, whom Paterson hired as an adviser for the Dari\u00e9n Scheme."]}, {"page": "Dari\u00e9n Gap", "response": ["Silver and gold from the viceroyalty of Peru were transported overland across the isthmus by Spanish Silver Train to Porto Bello, where Spanish treasure fleets shipped them to Seville and C\u00e1diz from 1707.
