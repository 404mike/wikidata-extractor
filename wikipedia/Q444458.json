She is best known for being part of the British curling team that won gold in the 2002 winter Olympics.In the 2002 Olympics, Knox played third for Rhona Martin.

Martin's team surged to an unexpected win, guaranteeing them a medal. As the underdog against Switzerland's Luzia Ebnother, the 2nd seed and a former World and European silver medalist, Britain won the final with Martin's last stone, often described as a difficult draw. The team of Martin, Debbie Knox, Fiona MacDonald and Janice Rankin thus became Great Britain's first gold medallists in any sport at the Winter Olympics since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean came first in the ice dancing of the 1984 Winter Olympics. Later that year, Martin was awarded an MBE for services to curling."]}, {"page": "Kelly Schafer", "response": ["Scotland's curling dominance over the two other host nations of Great Britain secured its place at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Schafer was shortlisted along with nine other female curlers to be considered for a place on the women's Olympic team and became successful to travel to Turin to defend Rhona Martin's Olympic gold that Team GB won in Salt Lake City in 2002. She joined Rhona Martin, Lynn Cameron, Jackie Lockhart and Debbie Knox. As in her other international games, Shaefer played second throughout the Olympic competition. However, despite beating U.S. 10\u20134 after only six ends, Team GB's Olympic hopes were shattered as Canada beat Denmark in a nail-biting match in the final end. A win over Canada by Denmark would have enabled Great Britain to go into a playoff to compete for the last semi-final position. When interviewed after the game Kelly conceded Team GB's loss was \"gutting\" but added \"we [Team GB] have to take the positives out of this.\""]}, {"page": "Continental Cup (curling)", "response": [" Rhona Martin, Debbie Knox, Fiona MacDonald, Janice Rankin"]}, {"page": "2006 European Curling Championships", "response": ["Third: Debbie Knox "]}, {"page": "Scottish Women's Curling Championship", "response": ["| 1992 || Jackie Lockhart || Debbie Knox || Wendy Bell || Judith Stobbie ||  Aberdeen", "| 1999 || Debbie Knox || Isobel Hannen || Wendy Bell || Judith Stobie || Howwood"]}, {"page": "1999 World Women's Curling Championship", "response": ["| || Debbie Knox || 1 || 8 "]}, {"page": "2002 Continental Cup of Curling", "response": ["* Rhona Martin, Debbie Knox, Fiona MacDonald, Janice Rankin"]}, {"page": "Deborah Knox", "response": ["#REDIRECT Debbie Knox"]}]}}
