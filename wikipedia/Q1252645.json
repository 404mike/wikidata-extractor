She established her reputation with her first novel, Cold Comfort Farm (1932) which has been reprinted many times. Although she was active as a writer for half a century, none of her later 22 novels or other literary works\u2014which included a sequel to Cold Comfort Farm\u2014achieved the same  critical or popular success. Much of her work was long out of print  before a modest revival in the 21st century.\nThe daughter of a London doctor, Gibbons had a turbulent and often unhappy childhood. After an indifferent school career she trained as a journalist, and worked  as a reporter and features writer, mainly for the Evening Standard and The Lady. Her first book, published in 1930, was a collection of poems which was well received, and through her life she considered herself primarily a poet rather than a novelist.  After Cold Comfort Farm, a satire on the genre of rural-themed \"loam and lovechild\" novels popular in the late 1920s, most of Gibbons's novels were based within the middle-class suburban world with which she was familiar.\nGibbons became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1950. Her style has been praised by critics for its charm, barbed humour and descriptive skill, and has led  to comparison with Jane Austen. The success of Cold Comfort Farm  dominated  her career, and she grew to resent her identification with the book to the exclusion of the rest of her output.  Widely regarded as a one-work novelist, she and her works have not been accepted into the canon of English literature\u2014partly, other writers have suggested, because of her detachment from the literary world and her tendency to mock it.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 19", "response": ["*1989 \u2013 Stella Gibbons, English journalist, author, and poet (b. 1902)"]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Stella Gibbons (1902\u20131989, E)"]}, {"page": "Feminist science fiction", "response": ["During the 1920s and 1930s, many popular pulp science fiction magazines exaggerated views of masculinity and featured portrayals of women that were perceived as sexist.Lisa Tuttle in Clute and Nicholls 1995, p. 1344.
