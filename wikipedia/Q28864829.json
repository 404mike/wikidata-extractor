In a 2008 interview, he said: \"The novel portrayed the British security forces in a rather slanted fashion, I thought. She was a rather pro-Left intellectual and a doctor.

Comber thought a similar series focussing initially on Southeast Asia was worth pursuing to \"give a tremendous boost to creative writing in English...which was still regarded then as something of a cultural desert\". He also wanted to publish the \"tremendous body of local writers writing in their local languages\" across the entire Asia in English translation \"to make it available to a wider reading public\" as he felt that existent publishers only focussed on their individual countries.", "| 1|| Ly Singko, ed. || 1967 || Modern Malaysian Chinese Stories.
