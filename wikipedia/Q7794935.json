He referred to county matches as \"a commonplace\" and wrote that \"everyone plays it, the common people and also men of rank\". If they were a commonplace, they were also keenly contested to the point where winning teams would proclaim their county's superiority. In August of the same year, a game at Penshurst Park (near Tonbridge) between Kent and Sussex was won by Kent. The teams were organised by Edwin Stead (Kent) and Sir William Gage (Sussex). Stead's team had earlier won two games against the 2nd Duke of Richmond's XI (also representing Sussex) and their victory over Gage's XI was reported as \"the third time this summer that the Kent men have been too expert for those of Sussex\". In August 1729, there was a return match, again at Penshurst Park, between Stead's XI and Gage's XI \u2013 alternatively titled Kent (Stead's XI) v Sussex, Surrey & Hampshire (Gage's XI). This was won by Gage's team, apparently by the earliest known innings victory. A match report singled out Thomas Waymark of Sussex for special praise, saying that he \"turned the scale of victory, which for some years past has been generally on the Kentish side\".
