Hull Kingston Rovers started better, and seized the initiative after just three minutes, with Paul Cooke's long pass to Peter Fox proving an opportunity for Kris Welham. Despite multiple handling errors from Simon Grix, the home side failed to extend their lead. Two goal-line dropouts eventually lead to Vinnie Anderson crashing over the try-line on the 16th minute, in front of the post; Chris Bridge converted to level the scores 6\u20136, which it remained until half-time thanks to a last resort tackle from fullback Shaun Briscoe to deny Ben Harrison a try. Monaghan retreated from the match in the 31st minute, but Warrington took the lead at the start of the second half when Jon Clarke finished off a Matt King break on the wing. Hull Kingston Rovers replied with two tries of their own in five minutes, from Clint Newton, and later Ben Galea following a kick from Paul Cooke which deceived Richie Mathers. With the scores already 18\u201312, Rovers extended their lead further on the hour with a break that covered half the \"New\" Craven Park pitch from Jake Webster. Matt King plucked Lee Briers' kick into the corner for a Warrington try and Chris Bridge made the scores level with another try in the 70th minute. Bridge converted his own try to give Warrington a slender two-point lead before a penalty conceded for offside provided Michael Dobson with an opportunity to level the game again. A knock on from the resulting kick-off gave Lee Briers a chance to land a drop goal, but he sliced the ball, forcing the game into extra time. He missed two further chances, before kicking the ball between the uprights in front of the visiting Warrington fans in the 85th minute."]}, {"page": "Fox (surname)", "response": ["* Peter Fox (artist) (born 1962), American painter", "* Peter Fox (musician) (born 1971), singer Pierre Baigorry of the German band Seeed", "* Peter Fox (Canadian politician) (1921\u20131989), Canadian politician", "* Peter Fox (bishop) (born 1952), British Anglican vicar and former bishop", "* Peter Fox (rugby league, born 1933), English player and coach", "* Peter Fox (footballer) (born 1957), English former footballer ", "* Peter Fox (rugby league, born 1933) (1933\u20132019), English rugby league footballer and coach", "* Peter Fox (rugby league, born 1984), English rugby league footballer", "* Peter Fox (sailor) (born 1967), New Zealand sailor", "* Peter Fox (disambiguation), various people with this name", "* Peter Fox (character), a fictional character in the comic strip FoxTrot by Bill Amend", "* Peter Fox (journalist) (died 1869), radical journalist active in England", "* Peter Fox (librarian) (born 1949), British academic librarian", "* Peter Fox (professor) (born 1959), American professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"]}, {"page": "Peter Fox (rugby league born 1984)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Fox (rugby league, born 1984)"]}, {"page": "2015 Wakefield Trinity Wildcats season", "response": ["| Peter Fox"]}]}}
