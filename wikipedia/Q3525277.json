During this time he entered open athletic meets and played for various English rugby teams including the Southampton Trojans, and from 1887 was a regular member of the London side Richmond. In 1885 Gould was invited to play for the newly formed Welsh exiles team London Welsh. London Scottish F.C. had been founded for Scottish players working or studying in the city, but until this time a London club for Welsh players had not existed. The side's first game, a trial match, was played on 21 October 1885 at Putney, and three days later the first team played London Scottish at the Saracens' Palmerston Road ground in Walthamstow. Gould played at half-back, and was joined in the team by Martyn Jordan, Thomas Judson, Rowley Thomas, Charles Taylor and T. Williams \u2013 all past or future Welsh internationals.

In 1882 Cattell was selected for the Welsh national team as part of the 1883 Home Nations Championship against England. This was the first match of the first Home Nations Championship and Cattell along with Thomas Judson and Harry Bowen became the first players to represent Llanelli in an international game. Under the captaincy of Charles Lewis, and played on Welsh soil for the first time, Wales were outclassed by an English team that had lost only three times in their first 21 matches. Although the Welsh were beaten by two goals and four tries to nil, it was seen as a far more promising result than the teams first meeting 22 months prior, and the selectors kept faith with the majority of the team. Cattell gained his second and final cap for Wales in a game away to Scotland at Raeburn Place. This was the first time the countries had faced each other in a rugby union match, and Wales lost by three goals to one. In the next season four new caps were  brought into the Welsh pack and Cattell was not reselected to represent Wales again."]}, {"page": "Harry Bowen (rugby union)", "response": ["Bowen joined Llanelli at the age of 15 and quickly became a club favourite.Smith (1980), p.62 He was first selected to represent Wales as part of the 1883 Home Nations Championship against England in the inaugural game of the new competition. Under the captaincy of Charles Lewis, Bowen was one of three Llanelli players chosen for the game, and along with teammates Alfred Cattell and Thomas Judson became the first player to represent Llanelli at international level. The game was a one sided affair, with England victorious, though the Welsh play was of a higher standard than the first encounter between the teams. The next game of the tournament was an away match to Scotland, and Wales experimented with one full-back player for the first time.Godwin (1984), p.2 Bowen was one of the full-backs, paired for the England game with captain Lewis, the selectors favoured Lewis, and Bowen was dropped."]}, {"page": "T.
