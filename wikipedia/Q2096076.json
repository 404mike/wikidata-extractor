Hugh Quarshie considered the part of Panaka as \"a good career move\" and a production that would be fun to make. Brian Blessed originally auditioned for the role of Sio Bibble, the Governor of Naboo, for which he was considered \"too loud\". Casting director Robin Gurland approached him to play Nass because it was a \"bigger than life\" character with \"a kind of bravado\". Blessed described Nass as a \"reluctant hero\". Sofia Coppola, daughter of Lucas' long-time friend and creative partner Francis Ford Coppola, considers Lucas as \"like an uncle to me\". As she prepared the script for her directorial debut The Virgin Suicides, Coppola heard Lucas would make a new Star Wars film and asked him if she could accompany him during filming. Lucas offered Coppola a role in the royal entourage, which she accepted because it \"seemed like a good vantage point to watch without getting in the way\"."]}, {"page": "Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones", "response": ["* Silas Carson as Nute Gunray and Ki-Adi-Mundi: Gunray is the Nemoidian Viceroy of the Trade Federation and one of the leaders of the Separatist movement, who puts a hit on Padm\u00e9 as revenge for his loss against her people on Naboo in The Phantom Menace.

Eventually, they chose a heavily Thai-accented English, and Carson rerecorded the dialogue to mimic the Thai actor's accent. Gunray's accent was described by critics to be \"Hollywood Oriental\" that contributed to criticism of Gunray as an Asian stereotype. Watto's accent was similarly criticized as lending to anti-Semitic and anti-Arab connotations."]}, {"page": "C-3PO", "response": ["After Anakin and Padm\u00e9's visit to Tatooine, C-3PO accompanies them to the planet Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) from Sith Lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee).

Influenced by the battle droid's programming, he reluctantly participates in the film's climactic battle scene, where he is stopped by Jedi Kit Fisto (Silas Carson).
