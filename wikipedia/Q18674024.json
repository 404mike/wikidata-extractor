Indeed, Chamberlain had been one of the NLC's most enthusiastic promoters upon its launch. At the 1884 ceremony of Gladstone's foundation-stone-laying for the club, Hartington had argued that the club would be the future home of Chamberlain's Radical Birmingham Caucus, and Chamberlain, standing next to him, pointedly refused to contradict him.Sir Alexander Mackintosh, Joseph Chamberlain: An Honest Biography (Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1914), p. 327. Chamberlain himself resigned in 1886, shortly after the Home Rule split, Hartington and other prominent Liberal Unionists followed early in 1887,Hamilton Fyfe and Joseph Irving (eds.), The Annals of Our Time ...: pt. 1. 20 June 1887 \u2013 December 1890 (Macmillan, London, 1891). and when a further 130 Unionists simultaneously seceded from the club in 1889, the Scots Observer called it \"one of the most important events that has recently occurred in home politics\", due to its ramifications for the Liberal Party breaking in two.The Scots Observer, Vol. 1 (1889), p. 58."]}, {"page": "Clan MacAulay", "response": ["According to George Fraser Black, the territorial designation Ardincaple did not become an ordinary surname until the 15th century.Black 1946: pp. 28\u201329. Several men with the surname Ardincaple or styled of Ardincaple are recorded in the Mediaeval Scottish records. Johannes de Ardenagappill was a charter witness in Lennox in about 1364. Arthur de Ardincapel witnessed a charter by Donnchadh, Earl of Lennox in about 1390. In 1489, a remission was granted to Robert Arnegapill for his part in the holding of Dumbarton Castle against the king of Scots. Later in 1513, Aulay Arngapill of that Ilk is mentioned in records. Later in 1529, an escheat of goods of Awlane Ardincapill of that Ilk is recorded. According to the 19th-century historian Joseph Irving, an early laird of Ardincaple was Alexander de Ardincaple, who in 1473, served on the inquest of the Earl of Menteith.Irving 1879, 2: pp. 294\u2013302. Another laird, Aulay de Ardincaple, was invested on a precept from John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox, in the lands of Faslane adjoining Ardincaple in 1518. Aulay and his wife, Katherine Cunningham, had sasine of the lands of Ardincaple in 1525. Several historians have stated that the first Laird of Ardincaple to take the surname MacAulay was Alexander de Ardincaple, son of this Aulay de Ardincaple.Anderson 1862: pp. 709\u2013710. Alexander lived during the reign of James V (reigned 1513\u20131542).

Aulay MacAulay's mother\u2014the wife of Walter MacAulay of Ardincaple\u2014was Margaret Drummond, eldest daughter of Alexander Drummond of Carnock.Irving 1879, 2: p. 297. Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple was married twice. His first wife was Joanna Cunningham, daughter of Cuthbert Cunningham of Corsehill. He later married Margaret Crawford, sometime before 24 April 1592, who was from the family of the Crawfords of Kilbirnie. Margaret Crawford was also the widow (and cousin) of James Galbraith of Culcreuch, 16th chief of Clan Galbraith.
