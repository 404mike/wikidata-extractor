Known for portraying a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, Sellers was referred to by Baron Cohen as \"the most seminal force in shaping [his] early ideas on comedy\".Saunders, Robert A. (2009). The Many Faces of Sacha Baron Cohen: Politics, Parody, and the Battle Over Borat. p. 22. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield. After leaving university, Baron Cohen worked for a time as a fashion model. By the early 1990s, he was hosting a weekly programme on Windsor cable television's local broadcasts with Carol Kirkwood, who later became a BBC weather forecaster. In 1995, Channel 4 was planning a replacement for its series The Word, and disseminated an open call for new television presenters. Baron Cohen sent in a tape of himself in the character of Kristo, an Albanian fictional television reporter (who developed into the Kazakh Borat Sagdiyev), which caught the attention of a producer. Baron Cohen hosted Pump TV from 1995 to 1996."]}, {"page": "Strictly Come Dancing", "response": ["| Carol Kirkwood ", "| Carol Kirkwood", "|Carol Kirkwood", "| Fiona Phillips & Brendan ColeCarol Kirkwood & Pasha Kovalev"]}, {"page": "Bray, Berkshire", "response": ["* Carol Kirkwood - BBC Weather presenter lives here"]}, {"page": "Morar", "response": ["* Morar is the birthplace of BBC weather forecaster Carol Kirkwood."]}, {"page": "Airways Airsports", "response": ["(2011) Judy Leden takes BBC Breakfast Weather reporter Carol Kirkwood flying in a hang glider to see a cloud close up and weight it, for BBC's The Great British Weather Show."]}, {"page": "Laura Tobin", "response": ["In 2015, she was nominated for a TRIC Award in the \"Weather Presenter\" category, but lost out to Carol Kirkwood.
