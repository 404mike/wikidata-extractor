His last Royal Academy submission (1888) was a portrait entitled Mrs. Keeley in her 83rd Year which is recorded as having subsequently found its way to London's bohemian Savage Club, of which the artist was a member from 1873 to 1894 and where his brother Edward was chairman of the committee.New York Times 22 June 1879. p. 2 Another Keeley painting, Mrs. Keeley at Fourscore (now housed at the Garrick Club) was exhibited at Institute of Oil Painters and Bond Street's Burlington GallerySunday Times 26 July 1885 in 1885. Goodman was an admirer of Mary Anne Keeley and her acting family, publishing an appreciation in 1895 entitled The Keeleys on the Stage and at Home, which contains engravings of several of his portrait paintings. Goodman's life interest in the theatre culminated in an appearance with Mrs. Keeley in a full-scale production on the stage of the Prince of Wales Theatre on the night of 16 January 1884. At about the same time he painted the actress, Mrs. Alfred Mellon (n\u00e9e Sarah Woolgar) . Another actress whose portrait Goodman painted was Amy Sedgwick. A year after her death in 1897, her third husband presented the portrait to the Garrick Club, where it remained until 1969.A Catalogue of Pictures in the Garrick Club compiled by C K Adams & published by the Club 1936 Other arts-related personalities who were captured by Goodman's brush included Negro Delineator, E. W. Mackney, the dramatist Henry Pettitt and composer Sir George A. MacFarren (who also sat for Goodman's mother Julia).", "Author and playwright Henry Pettitt is described by Goodman as being by far his worst sitter. During the difficult sittings Goodman learnt that Pettitt came to the stage at age 14 in a production at Sadler's Wells Theatre. Shortly after, Pettit gave up acting and trained as a teacher, later securing a position at the North London Collegiate School in Camden Town. Whilst there he wrote his first drama, entitled Golden Fruit in 1873. He continued to regale Goodman with stories of his many plays and successes at various theatres. Eventually, though, he falls into an almost trance-like state, awakening to recite lines from his various plays, oblivious to the fact that he was sitting for a portrait. This behaviour was repeated at every sitting. It must be assumed that Goodman was rather relieved when the work was completed."]}, {"page": "Faust up to Date", "response": ["Faust up to Date is a musical burlesque with a score written by Meyer Lutz (a few songs by others were interpolated into the show).
