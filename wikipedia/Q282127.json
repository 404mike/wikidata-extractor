Rumors of getting the project started surfaced every year or two since 1998, including Depp traveling to Dublin to work on a script with Donleavy, and Depp enlisting Shane MacGowan for a part, but it never seemed to get going.  In 2006 it appeared things were taking shape, with Depp selecting a director, Laurence Dunmore (The Libertine). Apparently, interest waned with the success of Pirates of the Caribbean.  Depp returned to Ireland to meet with Donleavy again in the summer of 2008.  As recently as June 2009, Donleavy was still hopeful that Depp would start the project in earnest."]}, {"page": "2004 Toronto International Film Festival", "response": ["* The Libertine (Laurence Dunmore)"]}, {"page": "Watermark (Enya album)", "response": ["The sleeve to Watermark was illustrated to a design painted by graphic designer Laurence Dunmore.

The artwork provided the inspiration to the music video for \"Orinoco Flow\".
