In the 2020 general election, Sinn F\u00e9in's performance improved significantly and it was the first time in almost a century that neither Fianna F\u00e1il nor Fine Gael won the most votes.

Sinn F\u00e9in was on the same side of the debate as the DUP and most of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in that they wanted to pull out when UK had its referendum in 1975. The party was critical of the supposed need for an EU constitution as proposed in 2002, and urged a \"No\" vote in the 2008 referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, although Mary Lou McDonald said that there was \"no contradiction in being pro-Europe, but anti-treaty\". In its manifesto for the 2015 UK general election, Sinn F\u00e9in pledged that the party would campaign for the UK to stay within the European Union (EU), with Martin McGuinness saying that an exit \"would be absolutely economically disastrous\". Gerry Adams said that, if there were to be a referendum on the question, there ought to be a separate and binding referendum for Northern Ireland. Its policy of a \"Europe of Equals\", and its critical engagement after 2001, together with its engagement with the European Parliament, marks a change from the party's previous opposition to the EU. The party expresses, on one hand, \"support for Europe-wide measures that promote and enhance human rights, equality and the all-Ireland agenda\", and on the other a \"principled opposition\" to a European superstate.
