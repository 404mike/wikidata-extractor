A watercolour portrait by Horace Hone (1756\u20131825) is in the National Galleries of Scotland.His early attempt to set up a merchanting business in Virginia was a failure and he returned to Scotland. After qualifying as a medical doctor he established a successful practice in Liverpool, England and after a few years was able to purchase a small estate in Dumfriesshire.  He became a Fellow of the London Medical Society and was a founder member of the Liverpool Literary Society. He was an early advocate of the abolition of slavery and wrote several political letters and pamphlets, including one to William Pitt, which made him a number of enemies.\nThroughout his life he was dogged by illness and in 1804 he became seriously unwell.  In an effort to find a cure,  he relinquished his Liverpool practice and went to Bath, Clifton and finally Sidmouth, where he died on 31 August 1805 at age 49.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adam Smith", "response": ["In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter.
