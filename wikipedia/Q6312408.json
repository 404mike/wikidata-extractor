There was an attempt to trim the show's length to the standard 2.5 hours for a stage show in the West but it still ran close to four hours long. The majority of reviews praised Ritchie's Scarlett and were duly impressed by Layton's staging; however, they criticized Foote's adaptation of the story, which relied heavily on the audience's prior knowledge of the characters and plot and as a result was sketchy in its presentation of both.

This is caused in part due to being deaf and partly because she is shielded by her guardian Miss Brigmore. Miss Brigmore is still governess at High Banks Hall where the Bensham children (who call her the Brigadier, not always affectionately) are also grown up and Mrs Bensham is terminally ill and soon dies. Barbara encounters Michael Radlet (Gerry Sundquist), who is also unaware of his true parentage, at a St Valentine's day dance. His mother Constance (now played by June Ritchie) has made him believe he is Donald Radlet's son. He and Barbara soon develop feelings for one another. Both Miss Brigmore and Constance manage to put an end to this by telling their respective children the truth about Barbara's parentage. Miss Brigmore wishes Barbara to marry Mr Bensham's son John so that Barbara can return to High Banks Hall as its mistress. However, neither John nor Barbara is keen on the match and John becomes engaged to someone else. Miss Brigmore's angry reaction to this news alerts Bensham to the depths of her ambition, and leads to a temporary breakdown in their previous friendly relationship. Meanwhile, Constance is courted by Patrick Ferrier, the son of a local baronet whom she knew when she was at High Banks Hall, who has recently returned from India; but he loses interest when he discovers that Constance is not the owner of Wolfborough Farm, which was left to Michael not Constance when Matthew and Donald died. Ferrier subsequently transfers his attentions to the Benshams' daughter Kate, even though he is much older than her. Ignoring the attentions of the Benshams' other son Dan, Barbara persists in pursuing Michael, having now learnt from Miss Brigmore's maid Mary Peel that Donald was not Michael's father so that there is no incestuous barrier to their marriage. When she thinks that Michael is attracted to Sarah, one of the farm servants, Barbara attacks Sarah, causing her to lose her leg, and Sarah's brother Jim in turn beats up Barbara, causing her suddenly to regain her hearing. Barbara tells Michael the truth about his parentage, but he does not believe her, and the two separate angrily."]}, {"page": "Stretford Children's Theatre", "response": ["Former members include Lynn Roden, John Comer, Vicky Ogden,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1290431/ John Mahoney,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001498/bio June Ritchie, and Brian Trueman,.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0874113/"]}, {"page": "This Is My Street", "response": ["This Is My Street is a 1963 black and white kitchen sink British film, directed by Sidney Hayers and starring Ian Hendry, June Ritchie, Avice Landone, John Hurt and Meredith Edwards.
