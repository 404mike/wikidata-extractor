He was said to be a great lecturer by one of his previous attendees, who stated that his \"clear diction, his felicity of language and his enthusiasm could not fail to evoke a response\" and that he was very good with illustrations. Freeman Dyson commented on Whittaker's lecture style by saying that students were \"warmed, not only by the physical presence of a big crowd packed together, but by the mental vigour and enthusiasm of the old man\". Whittaker's efforts helped transform the Edinburgh Mathematical Society from a teachers society to an academic research society and was a major driving force in introducing computational mathematics education to the UK and America."]}, {"page": "Keith Medal", "response": ["*1879\u201381: George Chrystal, on the Differential Telephone"]}, {"page": "Joseph Wedderburn", "response": ["In 1898 Joseph entered the University of Edinburgh.
