A specialist batsman, he achieved little in those four matches, but might have had a much more substantial Test career, had he not lost six of what should have been his best years to World War II.\nColin Bateman, a cricket writer, noted that \"Fishlock, a good county performer, was astonishingly unlucky when his Test chance did come along... A forcing left-hander, he went on two Ashes tours (1936\u201337) and (1946\u201347) and suffered hand injuries both times, restricting him to one Test overseas\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
