The fire department was telephoned, but the fire had spread from the front stairway to the top floors by the time firefighters arrived.  Annie was notified and returned to find her house in flames.  British minister Sir Edward Thornton and other diplomatic staff members hurried to the scene.  He took Annie and her daughter, who had been asleep upstairs and was rescued by two servants, to the British Legation before returning to the house to assist with rescuing valuables and personal items.  Many of the items from the first and second floors were saved, including paintings, furnishings, and silver. However, the upper floors were completely gutted, and the plaster and woodwork on the lower floors were heavily damaged.  The estimated cost of the damage was $50,000.
