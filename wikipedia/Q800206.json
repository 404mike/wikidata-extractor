He played for Nottingham Cricket Club from 1800 to 1829.\nA batsman and occasional wicket-keeper, Dennis took part in seven first-class matches, six for Nottingham, mostly against Sheffield Cricket Club, and one for a combined Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire side in 1803. He retired from cricket after the 1828 season because of failing vision, but he was persuaded to play in 1829.Dennis was landlord of the Eclipse Inn at Chapel Bar in Nottingham and had a reputation for gambling: in 1815, he laid a bet worth \u00a3120 on a local match and won. He suffered a stroke in 1831 and died shortly afterwards, only a month after the death of his wife.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Clarke (cricketer, born 1798)", "response": ["Besides his bowling, Clarke's greatest attribute was his captaincy and leadership. He was an astute tactician and perhaps the sport's first truly tactical captain who could \"think out\" the opposition by means of planned field positions and rotation of his bowlers. Taking the reins from Joseph Dennis, Clarke captained the old Nottingham town club from 1830 and automatically succeeded to the captaincy of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club when it was formed out of the town club in various stages between 1835 and 1840."]}, {"page": "1803 English cricket season", "response": ["* Joseph Dennis"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|Joseph Dennis"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Joseph Dennis"]}, {"page": "Joseph Dennis", "response": ["Joseph Dennis may refer to:", "* Joseph Dennis (cricketer) (1778\u20131831), English cricketer", "* Joseph Dennis (mathematician) (1905\u20131977), American mathematician"]}, {"page": "List of Nottingham Cricket Club players", "response": ["|Joseph Dennis"]}]}}
