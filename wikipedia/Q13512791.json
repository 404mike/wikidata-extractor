From the late 1920s onwards, Mynors was drawn more to matters of codicology than to purely classical questions. He prepared an edition of the 6th-century scholar Cassiodorus, for which he travelled extensively in continental Europe; a critical edition was published in 1937. In 1929, he was appointed librarian of Balliol College. This position gave impetus to create a catalogue of the college's medieval manuscripts. A similar project, a catalogue of the manuscripts housed at Durham Cathedral, was compiled in the 1930s.

His 1969 book English Cursive Book  Hands, 1250-1500 is \"the authoritative account\", according to David Ganz, and its formatting is still employed by other scholars. His work on punctuation (Pause and Effect: an Introduction to the History of Punctuation in the West, 1993) focuses on \"visual reading aids\" and was highly influential. His Lyell Lectures at Oxford discussed the prosopography of English scribes and focussed on how they wrote, rather than on terms for identifying scripts, and proved him an erudite and entertaining lecturer. His books have glossaries which demonstrate how precisely he used language. "]}, {"page": "1979 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Neil Ripley Ker. For services to palaeography."]}, {"page": "L. D.
