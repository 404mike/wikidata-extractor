He was a fluent Irish speaker, having learned the language from his parents.\nThomas died in Poplar in Feb, 1922.\nHe was a great uncle of James Callaghan, prime minister of the UK 1976-1979.\nCaptain Francis O'Neill included a photograph of him in his book of 1913, and remarked of him:\n\nOne of the pleasant surprises which conduced to render the Oireachtas of 1912 particularly interesting and enjoyable, was the introduction of Thomas Garoghan, the London piper, to a Dublin audience. He played on a full set of boxwood pipes, and according to one account, the performance was \u201csplendid and refined, but the tone of his instrument was too weak to be effective in a large concert hall.\u201d He did not have his pipes with him at the little assembly at Groome\u2019s hotel, but on the stage of the Rotunda each evening his music was much admired, and by uttering intelligibly on the chanter, \u201cPolly put the kettle on,\u201d the unique trick aroused the audience to enthusiasm.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Garoghan, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Garoghan"]}]}}
