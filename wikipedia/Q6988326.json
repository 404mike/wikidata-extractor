He began his career with Hull City, where he spent six seasons in the first team. During the 1989\u201390 season he had a spell on loan with Lancashire-based club Burnley. After leaving Hull in 1992, Buckley moved into non-League football, assisting Brigg Town, where he won the FA Vase in 1996, and North Ferriby United. Between 2003 and 2008 he was manager of Barton Town Old Boys.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clannad", "response": ["By the time Clannad entered Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin to record Fuaim (Irish for Sound), Enya had become a full-time member. The album displays the group's further experimentation with electronic instruments, and Enya is featured on lead vocals on \"An t\u00dall\" and \"Buaireadh an Ph\u00f3sta\". Neil Buckley plays the clarinet and saxophone with Noel Bridgeman on percussion and Pat Farrell on electric guitar. Fuaim was released by Tara Music in 1982. After a further European tour, their managers Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan left the group. Nicky had brought Enya into the group to expand their sound, yet the group soon settled into their \"boring\" musical formula once more and called a meeting during the tour. After a group vote, the Ryans split. Enya followed suit, feeling increasingly restricted in a band setting and pursued a solo career with the Ryans as collaborators, causing a rift between the two groups for a short time."]}, {"page": "Fuaim", "response": ["* Neil Buckley \u2013 clarinet, saxophones"]}]}}
