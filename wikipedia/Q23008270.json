Her work draws heavily on Primitivism and Expressionism.Born in Toulouse and brought up near Nuremberg, Achaintre obtained a scholarship at the Kunsthochschule in Halle, then came to London to study at the Chelsea College of Arts and then at Goldsmiths, University of London before establishing a studio in Homerton, East London.Much of her earlier work was in textiles, particularly wool, and Primitivist in style, though she has also worked in installation, and also in ink on paper and ceramics. Much of this work draws on traditions of carnival and tribal masks and the potential to both attract and repulse through the materials. She has held a number of residencies and exhibited in a number of locations, including London's Saatchi Gallery, Cell Project Space (London), Birmingham's Eastside Projects, and as part of the eighth British Art Show.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Textile arts", "response": ["*Caroline Achaintre"]}, {"page": "British Art Show", "response": ["Abake, Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Caroline Achaintre, John Akomfrah and Trevor Mathison, Aaron Angell, Pablo Bronstein, Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin, Andrea B\u00fcttner, Alexandre da Cunha, Nicolas Deshayes, Benedict Drew, Simon Fujiwara, Martino Gamper, Ryan Gander, Melanie Gilligan, Anthea Hamilton, Will Holder, Alan Kane, Mikhail Karikis, Linder, Rachel Maclean, Ahmet Ogut, Yuri Pattison, Ciara Phillips, Charlotte Prodger, Laure Prouvost, Magali Reus, James Richards, Eileen Simpson and Ben White, Daniel Sinsel, Cally Spooner, Patrick Staff, Imogen Stidworthy, Hayley Tompkins, Jessica Warboys, Stuart Whipps, Bedwyr Williams, Jesse Wine, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye.http://www.artlyst.com/articles/british-art-show-8-exhibitors-announced-by-hayward-touring"]}, {"page": "Camden Arts Centre", "response": ["Central to its programme is the artist residency programme, which aims to develop artists' practices with practical support, resulting in new work and public participation.
