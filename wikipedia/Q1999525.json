He made 22 international appearances for Scotland and was selected for their 1978 FIFA World Cup squad, but was sent home from the tournament after failing a drugs test.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rangers F.C.", "response": ["In 1972, Rangers emerged from the tragedy of the previous year to finally achieve success on the European stage. A Colin Stein goal and a Willie Johnston double helped secure a 3\u20132 victory over Dynamo Moscow at the Nou Camp, Barcelona, to lift the European Cup Winners' Cup. Captain John Greig received the trophy in a small room within the Nou Camp following pitch invasions by Rangers fans reacting to the heavy handed tactics of the Spanish police, the majority of whom had been brought in from outwith Catalonia. Rangers were banned from Europe for two years for the behaviour of their fans, later reduced on appeal to one year."]}, {"page": "1978 FIFA World Cup", "response": ["Peru pushed the Netherlands into second place in Group 4, where Scotland missed out on goal difference for the second successive tournament. Te\u00f3filo Cubillas was outstanding for Peru, scoring twice against Scotland in Peru's 3\u20131 win and hitting a hat-trick in their 4\u20131 victory over newcomers Iran. Rob Rensenbrink of the Netherlands also scored three times against Iran, scoring all the goals as the Dutch won 3\u20130. Scotland drew with Iran 1\u20131 and the only highlight of their campaign was a 3\u20132 victory over the Netherlands in their final group game which was not enough to prevent elimination. Iran, the reigning Asian champions, went out of the tournament winless. Rensenbrink's goal against Scotland was the 1000th goal of World Cup history. Scotland's Willie Johnston was expelled from the World Cup after he was found to have taken a banned stimulant during the opening game against Peru."]}, {"page": "Aberdeen F.C.", "response": ["The same situation applies to Aberdeen's rivalry with Rangers, in that Rangers have their own much older and well-known Old Firm rivalry with Celtic. Aberdeen's rivalry with Rangers arose after a number of incidents in matches between the two clubs in the 1980s, namely Willie Johnston's stamp on John McMaster's neck in the Scottish League Cup and Neil Simpson's tackle on Ian Durrant in 1988, as well as Aberdeen's dominance in Scottish football throughout the decade. There are still often violent clashes between both sets of supporters within and outwith the stadium to this day."]}, {"page": "Lochore Welfare F.C.", "response": ["The club can boast of giving some football's talented players their first footing on the ladder to success and stardom. Among these are Willie Johnston, who could often be seen playing for Lochore before going on to play for Rangers and Scotland and Ian Porterfield, whose greatest moment of glory was scoring the winning goal for Sunderland in the 1973 FA Cup Final. Craig Levein was another Lochore old boy who went on to play for Scotland and Hearts and most recently Colin Cameron."]}, {"page": "Ally MacLeod", "response": ["Some observers were worried by the absence through injury of full-back Danny McGrain. Opponents Peru's impressive credentials went overlooked and were not expected to provide many problems in the first match. Peru, however, won the game 3\u20131. Scotland took the lead but Don Masson missed a penalty and in general failed to play to their potential. Before the match journalist James McKillop had written in The Glasgow Herald that \"The suggestion that we might not win is unthinkable and can be dismissed out of hand.\" As MacLeod himself put it, the performance against Peru was \"rank bad\". Plentiful excuses emerged: there had been a dispute concerning bonuses, the hotel swimming pool had no water in it, there was nothing for the players to do. It was then revealed that the winger Willie Johnston had taken a cold tablet which contained a banned stimulant fencamfamine (Reactivan). He was sent home. MacLeod, at a press conference, saw a mongrel dog approach: \"I think he is the only friend I have got left\", he said, stretching out a hand."]}, {"page": "Vicente Pern\u00eda", "response": ["Pern\u00eda was widely hailed as the best Argentine right defender of his time, but Argentina national team coach C\u00e9sar Menotti chose not to call him to the 1978 FIFA World Cup squad, after some rude altercations in friendly matches, notably a friendly against Scotland played 18 June 1977, when he was sent off for repeated violent fouls against Willie Johnston ."]}, {"page": "1972 European Cup Winners' Cup Final", "response": ["Rangers began their route to the final by beating Stade Rennes 2\u20131 on aggregate.  The first leg was drawn 1\u20131 with Willie Johnston scoring for Rangers.  Rangers won the return leg 1\u20130 through Alex MacDonald.  The second round saw Rangers play Sporting CP from Portugal.  Rangers led the first half of the first leg 3\u20130, but lost two goals in the second half to lead 3\u20132 going into the second leg.  The second leg finished 3\u20132 to Sporting, 5\u20135 on aggregate.  Willie Henderson scored for Rangers in extra time but Rangers then lost a goal with six minutes left to make it 6\u20136 on aggregate.  What followed has been described as being one of the most bizarre incidents in the history of any European tournament. The Dutch referee Laurens van Raavens failed to recognise that Rangers, having scored three away goals to Sporting's two, had won the tie.  But the referee made both teams take five penalties each, with Rangers losing the shootout.  After Rangers manager Willie Waddell pointed out the away goals rule to UEFA, the referee was overruled, the result overturned and Rangers were heading into the next round.  Rangers then played Torino, Italian league leaders at the time, and won 2\u20131 on aggregate.  In the semi final Rangers played Bayern Munich, who had beaten Rangers in the final five years previously in Nuremberg. Rangers progressed 3\u20131 on aggregate to reach their third European final.", "Dynamo were missing Kozlov and Kozhemyakin through injury and tried to play a more defensive type of game to contain Rangers.  Rangers employed an attacking line up and had a two-goal lead by half time. The first was scored by forward Colin Stein with the assist provided by Dave Smith.  The second was scored by Willie Johnston after he headed in a Dave Smith pass with six minutes to go before half time.  Rangers went 3\u20130 up minutes into the second half as Willie Johnston scored his second after a long kick out by goalkeeper Peter McCloy. Dynamo Moscow came back into the match when with thirty minutes left for play Eshtrekov scored after a defensive mistake from the Rangers back line. Dynamo continued to pressure however the Rangers keeper Peter McCloy twice made fine saves from Gershkovich and Sandy Jardine cleared off the line from Evryuzhihin. Moscow found their second with three minutes left with a goal from Makhovikov. Rangers held on to secure their only trophy in Europe in front of almost 25,000 people, albeit there was no award ceremony in the stadium due to the Rangers fans pitch invasion.", "|FW ||11|| Willie Johnston"]}]}}
