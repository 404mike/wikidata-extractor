In 1930, he signed for First Division club Manchester City, but he was not a success at that level, and moved on to Fulham. He helped them gain promotion to the Second Division, but played little after that. He joined Exeter City of the Third Division South in March 1933. In his second full season with Exeter he began scoring heavily, and at his final club, Chester of the Third Division North, he set a club record of 73 Football League goals that stood for 40 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wrightson", "response": ["*Paddy Wrightson, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Reg Siddle", "response": ["Siddle played local football for Albert Hill before signing amateur forms with Darlington of the Football League Third Division North.

He played in the remaining eight matches of the season and scored three more goals, including one in a 3\u20133 draw with South Shields F.C. and the second goal in a 2\u20131 win away to Crewe Alexandra. He began the 1930\u201331 season in the North-Eastern League team, had a run of four matches in the league side standing in for Francis Wallace at inside left, and another six matches late on in which he scored twice. Siddle began the following season in the league side: he scored in each of the first three matchesthe first was later expunged when opponents Wigan Borough foldedbut was dropped after five goalless appearances. He signed on again for 1932\u201333, but played much more for the reserves than the first team, to the extent that he was selected for a North-Eastern League team to face a Durham Amateur XI in April 1933 as part of the Durham FA's jubilee celebrations."]}, {"page": "Frank Wrightson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paddy Wrightson"]}, {"page": "Harry Poulter", "response": ["He played regularly and scored well during the 1934\u201335 season, to the extent that scouts were watching him and fellow goalscorer Paddy Wrightson. The Western Morning News expressed concern that the directors might feel compelled by the club's parlous financial state to accept any serious offer. He did not leave, and began the new season in the team. But in early September, he was again taken ill with what was initially described as \"stomach trouble\". He returned to the reserves in January, claimed to feel no after-effects from his illness, and attempted a return to first-team football, but \"failed to recapture his old form\" and intended to retire from professional football at the end of the season. Given a free transfer by Exeter, Poulter returned to the north-east and began a month's trial with Hartlepools United in August 1936, but he never played league football for them."]}, {"page": "List of Chester City F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Paddy Wrightson", "| Paddy Wrightson"]}, {"page": "1935\u201336 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Paddy Wrightson"]}, {"page": "1936\u201337 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Paddy Wrightson"]}, {"page": "1937\u201338 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Paddy Wrightson"]}, {"page": "1938\u201339 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Paddy Wrightson"]}]}}
