Writer Kevin Jackson has noted that director F. W. Murnau \"was friendly with and protective of a number of Jewish men and women\" throughout his life, including Jewish actor Alexander Granach, who plays Knock in Nosferatu.Jackson 2013 page 20 Additionally, Magistrale wrote that Murnau, being a homosexual, would have been \"presumably more sensitive to the persecution of a subgroup inside the larger German society\". As such, it has been said that perceived associations between Orlok and anti-Semitic stereotypes are unlikely to have been conscious decisions on the part of Murnau."]}, {"page": "List of Vanderbilt University people", "response": ["* Kevin Jackson, British writer, broadcaster, filmmaker and pataphysician, former Professor of English, regular BBC contributor, Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Companion of the Guild of St George"]}, {"page": "2002 in poetry", "response": ["* Anthony Burgess, Revolutionary Sonnets and Other Poems, edited by Kevin Jackson"]}, {"page": "Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)", "response": ["In 1997, Iain Sinclair collaborated with Chris Petit, sculptor Steve Dilworth and others to make The Falconer, a 56-minute semi-fictional \"documentary\" film about Whitehead, set in London and the Outer Hebrides.

A selection of translated sonnets by Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, originally appearing in the novel Abba Abba, also appears, although many of the sonnets are omitted. The reason given for this in the book's introduction is that Abba Abba remained in print at time of publication.
