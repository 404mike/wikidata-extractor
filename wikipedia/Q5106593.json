Freeman's research focuses on carbon cycling, with an emphasis on peatland carbon storage and dissolved organic carbon dynamics. His work is best known for its description of a mechanism known as the \"peatland enzymic latch\" and observation of a rising trend in aquatic dissolved organic carbon concentrations. His work has been recognised with awards from the American Society for Limnology and Oceanography and the Royal Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Professor Chris Freeman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Freeman (scientist)"]}, {"page": "Chris Freeman", "response": ["Chris Freeman may refer to:", "* Chris Freeman (Australian musician) (c. 1950 \u2013 1992), Australian classical and flamenco multi-instrumentalist", "* Chris Freeman (musician) (born 1961), American bassist, founding member of Pansy Division", "* Chris Freeman, British keyboardist/percussionist, former member of the band Manchester Orchestra", "* Chris Freeman (scientist), British environmental scientist"]}, {"page": "Outline of oceanography", "response": ["* Chris Freeman (scientist) \u2013 British biochemist, Professor at Bangor University"]}, {"page": "List of climate scientists", "response": ["*Chris Freeman, Welsh professor of biogeochemistry"]}, {"page": "Mullard Award", "response": ["|2007 ||Chris Freeman || || "]}, {"page": "Climate change feedback", "response": ["It has also been suggested (by Chris Freeman) that the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat bogs into water courses (from which it would in turn enter the atmosphere) constitutes a positive feedback for global warming. The carbon currently stored in peatlands (390\u2013455 gigatonnes, one-third of the total land-based carbon store) is over half the amount of carbon already in the atmosphere. DOC levels in water courses are observably rising; Freeman's hypothesis is that, not elevated temperatures, but elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are responsible, through stimulation of primary productivity."]}]}}
