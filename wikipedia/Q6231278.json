Woodington, John Ternouth and John Edward Carew, respectively.", "Installation of the bronze reliefs on the pedestal did not begin until late 1849, when John Edward Carew's depiction of the death of Nelson was put in place on the side facing Whitehall. This was followed early the next year by William F. Woodington's relief of the Battle of the Nile on the opposite side. Carew's relief was cast by Adams, Christie and Co. of Rotherhithe. The other three were cast by Moore, Fressange and Moore. The last to be made, The Battle of Cape St. Vincent became the subject of legal action, when it was discovered that the bronze had been adulterated with iron. The partners in the company were jailed for fraud and the relief was completed by Robinson and Cottam. It was finally put in place in May 1854.", "File:Nelson's column - Death of Nelson at Trafalgar.JPG|The Death of Nelson at Trafalgar by John Edward Carew, the relief on the south face of the plinth"]}, {"page": "Tramore", "response": ["* John Edward Carew, sculptor, was born here "]}, {"page": "Carew (surname)", "response": ["*John Edward Carew (1782\u20131868), Anglo-Irish sculptor"]}, {"page": "1868 in art", "response": ["* December 1 \u2013 John Edward Carew, Irish sculptor (born c. 1782)"]}, {"page": "Petworth House", "response": ["Today's building houses an important collection of paintings and sculptures, including 19 oil paintings by J.

Having seen an earlier version of this work by Hogan in Dublin, Bishop Fleming left funds and directions in his last will and testament that a \"Dead Christ by Hogan\" be purchased for the Cathedral. Prior to coming to Newfoundland, Fleming's successor, Bishop Mullock, also had a version of the Hogan Dead Christ installed in his own chapel, the South Chapel {St. Finbar's} in Cork. Mullock commissioned a new rendering of the statue and placed it beneath the table of the High Altar on 19 March 1855. The statue is Hogan's greatest masterpiece and is the final of three similar statues created by Hogan in the early 19th century and the only one located outside Ireland.

Within a year of his arrival in Rome he won the first prize for sculpture offered by the Florentine Academy of Arts, and in the following year he gained the papal gold medal awarded by the Academy of St Luke with his bas-relief of Joseph and his brothers.
