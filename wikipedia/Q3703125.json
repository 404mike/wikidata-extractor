He carried out the systems analysis and charting for the world's first routine business computer job, thus he is also called \"the first business application programmer\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "LEO (computer)", "response": ["The prototype LEO I was modelled closely on the Cambridge EDSAC. Its construction was overseen by Oliver Standingford, Raymond Thompson and David Caminer of J.\u00a0Lyons and Co. LEO\u00a0I ran its first business application in 1951. In 1954 Lyons formed LEO Computers Ltd to market LEO\u00a0I and its successors LEO\u00a0II and LEO\u00a0III to other companies. LEO Computers eventually became part of English Electric Company (EEL), (EELM), then English Electric Computers (EEC), where the same team developed the faster LEO\u00a0360 and even faster LEO\u00a0326 models.

Therefore, its chief designer, John Pinkerton, designed the machine to have multiple input/output buffers. In the first instance, these were linked to fast paper tape readers and punches, fast punched card readers and punches, and a 100 line a minute tabulator. Later, other devices, including magnetic tape, were added. Its ultrasonic delay-line memory based on tanks of mercury, with 2K (2048) 35-bit words (i.e., 8 kilobytes), was four times as large as that of EDSAC. The systems analysis was carried out by David Caminer."]}, {"page": "Treisman", "response": ["* David Treisman, known as David Caminer (1915\u20132008), British electronic systems analyst"]}, {"page": "Morley College", "response": ["* David Caminer, systems analyst; helped design LEO, the world's first business computer"]}, {"page": "John Pinkerton (computer designer)", "response": ["John Maurice McClean Pinkerton (2 August 1919 \u2013 22 December 1997) was a pioneering British computer designer.
