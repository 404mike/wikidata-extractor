That October 1958 Scottish League Cup Final was won with a heavy 5\u20131 defeat of Partick Thistle. Bauld and Murray each scored two and Johnny Hamilton netted one. Hearts defended their league title by being leaders in mid December. However a side visiting Ibrox missing injured Mackay were beaten 5\u20130 with all goals in the first 35 minutes. This put Rangers into top position in the table on goal average. This precipitated a run of only two wins from the next seven games without injured Mackay. Hearts beat Queen of the South in a 2\u20131 home league win on 7 March 1959. After that QoS game Rangers with six games to play were firm favourites for the title, six points ahead of second placed Hearts. Even if Hearts were to win their remaining seven games including a game in hand and beating Rangers in their visit Tynecastle in Rangers' penultimate game of the season, Rangers would still have to drop two points elsewhere and give away a superior goal average. The league game against QoS was Mackay's last for Hearts after they accepted a bid of \u00a332,000 from Tottenham Hotspur for their captain who was fit at this time despite having had lengthy spells out injured in the previous 12 months. Bobby Rankin was brought in to bolster the squad and scored twice in each of his first two games (both victories). On the penultimate Saturday of the league campaign goals by Cumming and Rankin at home to Rangers meant Hearts were four points behind with a game in hand. In midweek they next won 4\u20132 at Aberdeen with Rankin scoring a hat-trick. The last day of the season began with Rangers two points clear with an identical goal average to Hearts. Rangers thus needed a point to clinch the title but lost 2\u20131 at home to Aberdeen. Despite missing Bobby Kirk at right back with a knee injury, Rankin's ninth goal from his fifth Hearts game had Hearts 1\u20130 up at half time at Celtic Park. Any victory would have given Hearts the title. Then Celtic's Bertie Auld playing at left wing equalised before Eric Smith scored Celtic's winning second goal to seal the title for their cross city rivals leaving those at Tynecastle to wonder what would have happened if Mackay hadn't been sold when he was."]}, {"page": "Greenock Morton F.C.", "response": ["*  Eric Smith (1972)"]}, {"page": "Eric Smith", "response": ["Eric Smith may refer to:", "*Eric Smith (safety) (born 1983), American former football player and assistant coach", "*Eric Smith (offensive lineman) (born 1995), American football offensive tackle", "*Eric Smith (wide receiver) (born 1971), American football wide receiver", "*Eric Smith (Scottish footballer) (1934\u20131991), Scottish international footballer who played for Celtic and Leeds United", "*Eric Smith (Swedish footballer) (born 1997), Swedish football midfielder", "*Eric Smith (canoeist) (born 1964), Canadian Olympic sprint canoeist", "*Eric Smith (British politician) (1908\u20131951), British Conservative politician, MP, 1950\u20131951", "*Eric Smith (Kansas politician), member of the Kansas House of Representatives", "*Eric Smith (artist) (1919\u20132017), Australian artist", "*Eric Smith (British Army officer) (1923\u20131998), British Army officer and military historian", "*Eric Smith (general) (fl. 1980s\u20132020s), United States Marine Corps general", "*Eric Smith (sportscaster) (born 1975), Canadian basketball analyst and Toronto Raptors radio sportscaster", "*Eric Smith (murderer) (born 1980), American murderer, convicted of killing a 4-year-old boy when he was 13 years old"]}]}}
