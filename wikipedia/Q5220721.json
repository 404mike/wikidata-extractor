He signed for Conference National club York City a year later after being released by Cardiff. He did not establish himself in the team in the 2006\u201307 season, but played in their play-off semi-final defeat by Morecambe. He became a regular starter during 2007\u201308 under the management of Colin Walker, and during 2008\u201309 assumed the captaincy from Mark Greaves. In this season, he was named Clubman of the Year and led the team to the 2009 FA Trophy Final, in which York were beaten 2\u20130 by Stevenage Borough. Parslow was replaced as captain by Michael Ingham during 2009\u201310, and was an unused substitute in York's 3\u20131 defeat by Oxford United in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final. He won his second Clubman of the Year award in 2010\u201311, having appeared in all of York's matches that season.\nParslow was a member of the York team that won the 2012 FA Trophy Final and 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final in 2011\u201312, with victory in the latter seeing the club promoted into League Two after eight years out of the Football League. He missed only one match in 2012\u201313, in which he won the Clubman of the Year award for an unprecedented third time. Parslow was out injured for most of 2013\u201314, and was on loan with Conference Premier club Grimsby Town during 2014\u201315, playing in their penalty shoot-out defeat in the 2015 Conference Premier play-off Final. He signed for Cheltenham Town of the National League in 2015, and was part of the team that earned promotion into League Two by winning the divisional title in 2015\u201316. He returned to York, initially on loan, in 2017 and helped them win in the 2017 FA Trophy Final.
