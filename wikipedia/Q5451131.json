The Law Society Gazette On 22 November 2012, it was announced that the college had been granted full university status and its name would be changed to \"The University of Law\". Shortly thereafter, Montague Private Equity completed the acquisition process.  This raised questions about the legality of transferring the degree-awarding powers granted under royal charter to the original College of Law to the newly created company, and then selling that company, now with university status, to a for-profit provider. The UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills explained that while degree-awarding powers cannot be transferred, when a whole institute changes its legal status, the powers remain with it. This was considered to be the case with The University of Law because all of the original College of Law's education and training business had been transferred to the for-profit college, and the activities remaining with the chartered body were not related to the degree-awarding powers.

The reasons for their withdrawal in each case were objections related to their perceived closeness to individuals and establishments which would be investigated. There were also objections to the shape of the inquiry itself, concerning testimony, the scope of inquiry, and lack of ability to compel witnesses to testify.  In December 2014 it was reported that Theresa May was reconsidering arrangements for the inquiry.   On 4 February 2015 May announced that the inquiry would be chaired by Dame Lowell Goddard, a New Zealand High Court judge who had no ties to the UK bodies and persons likely to be investigated.

Alexis Jay, chair of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham, would also be a member of the panel.", "In October 2014 the chairing of the inquiry again became contentious after Fiona Woolf disclosed that she lived in the same street in London as Lord (Leon) Brittan and had, amongst other connections with them, invited the Conservative peer and his wife to dinner on three occasions. Lord Brittan was Home Secretary in 1984 when ministers were handed a dossier on alleged high-profile paedophiles which later disappeared; Brittan insisted that the proper procedures had been followed. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who had campaigned for the inquiry to be established, told the BBC he thought Woolf should resign, accusing the Home Office of a \"total error of judgement\u201d. He added: \u201cOne mistake is forgivable... to make the same mistake twice looks like they're out to protect Leon Brittan. I don't buy the view that you can't choose someone to chair this inquiry who is not connected to Leon Brittan and yet the government seem to have been insistent on choosing chairpeople who are very much establishment, very much connected to people involved\". A second Labour MP, John Mann, also criticised the appointment, saying it was \u201ctotally impossible for Fiona Woolf to now properly chair child abuse inquiry\u201d given that \"Leon Brittan oversaw significant inquiries that vanished\". However, Woolf told MPs that Brittan was \"one of thousands of people\" she knew and was not a \"close associate\"; the government said it continued to back her appointment. Home Secretary Theresa May also supported Woolf's appointment, saying: \"Fiona Woolf has a long and distinguished career throughout which she has demonstrated the highest standards of integrity. I am confident that she will lead the work of the panel with authority, and that under her leadership the panel will get to the truth of these issues\".", "On 22 October 2014, the BBC reported that it had seen a judicial review application launched by a victim of historical child sexual abuse which challenged the choice of Fiona Woolf as the chair of the inquiry on the basis that she is not impartial, has no relevant expertise and may not have time to discharge her duties. However, the judicial review became unnecessary on 31 October 2014, when Woolf announced that she was resigning as chair of the inquiry. Her decision came on the day that victims and survivors of child abuse said that they were \"unanimous\" that she should quit, citing her social links with ex-Home Secretary Lord Brittan; their announcement came immediately after a meeting with Home Office officials. In a statement, Home Secretary Theresa May said that she had accepted Woolf's decision \"with regret\".", "File:Fiona Woolf (cropped).jpg|Fiona Woolf(Sept\u2014Oct 2014)"]}, {"page": "Institute of Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability", "response": ["ICRS was launched on 9 July 2014 at Guildhall in London, with speeches by the Lord Mayor of London, Fiona Woolf; the Minister for Civil Society, Hon.
