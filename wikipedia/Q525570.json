Edith Cross joined her on the trip. She successfully defended her French singles title by defeating sixth-seeded home favorite Simonne Mathieu in the final. In the doubles event she teamed up with Edith Cross and lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champions Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez and Kea Bouman. She played in the mixed doubles with Frank Hunter and were beaten in the final by the Anglo-French team of Eileen Bennett and Henri Cochet. Wills then played international matches, as part of a U.S. team, against the Netherlands in May, beating Madzy Rollin Couquerque and Kea Bouman, and against Germany, played at the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club in Berlin in June, where she won against Cilly Aussem and Paula von Reznicek. At the Wimbledon Championships a third final against Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez was anticipated but instead Wills faced fifth-seeded Helen Jacobs, their first encounter in a Grand Slam final. Wills won her third consecutive Wimbledon singles title in straight sets. With Edith Cross she lost in the third round of the doubles to Ermyntrude Harvey but won the mixed doubles title with Frank Hunter against Ian Collins and Joan Fry. In the seventh edition of the Wightman Cup, played on August 8 and 9 at the West Side Tennis Club, Wills won both her singles matches, including a close two-sets win against Betty Nuthall, to help the U.S. team reclaim the cup but lost her doubles match with Cross against Phoebe Holcroft Watson and Peggy Michell. Later that month she won her sixth U.S. National Championships singles title after a victory in the final against second-seeded foreign player Phoebe Holcroft Watson. She played no further tournaments that year and, despite only competing in three tournaments, was ranked No. 1 in the world by A. Wallis Myers for the third successive time, this time ahead of Holcroft Watson and Jacobs."]}, {"page": "Vincent Richards", "response": ["| style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1925 || U.S. National Championships || Grass ||  Ermyntrude Harvey ||  Kitty McKane   John Hawkes || 2\u20136, 4\u20136"]}, {"page": "Queen's Club Championships", "response": ["| 1925 ||  Elizabeth Ryan ||  Ermyntrude Harvey || 6\u20130, 6\u20131"]}, {"page": "List of US Open women's doubles champions", "response": ["| 1927 || Kitty McKane Godfree  Ermyntrude Harvey || Betty Nuthall  Joan Fry || 6\u20131, 4\u20136, 6\u20134"]}, {"page": "List of US Open mixed doubles champions", "response": ["| align=\"center\"|1925||  Kitty McKane Godfree John B.
