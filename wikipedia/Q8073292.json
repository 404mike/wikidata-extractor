He will be introduced as the son of established former character Pierce Harris (Jonathan Wrather), who is in prison due to murdering Graham Foster (Andrew Scarborough). Justin Harp of Digital Spy wrote that Marcus is set to arrive in the fictional village with his own traumatic experiences from living with Pierce, who abused his mother. Harp wrote that Marcus shares numerous traits with Pierce, such as his brooding, suaveness and good looks. He also questioned whether the similarities end there or if Marcus would share Pierce's violent attributes. Producer Kate Brooks said that Marcus' arrival will \"ruffle a few feathers and flutter a few hearts in the village\" and confirmed that viewers would soon realise that he is more than the son of Pierce. However, Brooks hinted that some villagers may not be as accepting of Marcus due to him potentially being \"forever doomed to live in the shadow of his father's heinous crimes\". Rhona Goskirk (Zo\u00eb Henry), who was raped by Pierce, is worried by Marcus' arrival in the village. Inside Soap wrote that her life \"is to be turned upside down\" by his arrival and that the story would see her happiness with partner Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock) threatened."]}, {"page": "Zoe Henry", "response": ["#REDIRECT Zo\u00eb Henry"]}]}}
