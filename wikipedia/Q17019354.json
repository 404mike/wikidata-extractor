A left-arm orthodox spinner, he played two matches at List-A level, and a further three at first-class level. His two List A matches came during the 1996 English season: one against Yorkshire in the Benson & Hedges Cup, in which he took 2/29 from ten overs, and the other against Durham in the NatWest Trophy, in which he went wicketless. Tennant's matches at first-class level all came in the annual series against Ireland, in which he participated in 1996, 1999, and 2000. He took nine wickets in these matches \u2013 his best figures, 3/28, came in the 1996 fixture, and included two stumpings by Alec Davies. At club level, Tennant played for the Prestwick Cricket Club, which from 1999 played in the new Scottish National Cricket League (SNCL).Tennant was appointed Cricket Scotland's youth development manager in May 2004, and served in the position until 2006, when he was replaced by Peter Steindl.
