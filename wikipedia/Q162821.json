The company's 50th anniversary was celebrated in 2006 with a gala concert in which tributes were paid to Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, the principal artists, the chorus, production staff and the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra (the AOBO) for their \"artistry and talent\" and the \"ensemble nature\" of the company.Opera Australia's 50th Anniversary Gala Programme Note. 2006. p.\u00a03, Hickox.

Also included was an article titled \"Circumstantial Evidence\" by the Elgar authority Christopher Kent from the August 1997 Musical Times explaining the sketches. One idea in the sketches was marked by the composer \"jolly good\". Kent believed that Elgar's compositional thoughts and time were by then engaged with the Third Symphony and The Spanish Lady, and that the main theme for the march was \"unpromising\". Payne felt there was not enough in the sketches to complete the march, but three pages of score in Elgar's handwriting were discovered at the Royal School of Church Music Colles Library marked \"P&C 6\". In 2006, the score and sketches were turned into a performing version. Payne observed in the programme notes that \"Nowhere else in the Pomp and Circumstance marches does Elgar combine compound and duple metres in this way\". Payne concluded the piece with a brief allusion to the first Pomp and Circumstance March. The world premiere of Payne's version was on 2 August 2006 with Andrew Davis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at The Proms at Royal Albert Hall.
