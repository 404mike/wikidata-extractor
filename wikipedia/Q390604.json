He is Newcastle United's third highest goalscorer of all-time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ivor Allchurch", "response": ["Known as the \"Golden Boy of Welsh football\", Allchurch played as an inside forward, and began his career playing for his hometown side Swansea Town where he spent over 10 years, captaining the side for several seasons and scoring over 100 goals in all competitions. He attracted attention from numerous clubs during his early years with Swansea but chose to remain with the club until the age of 28 when he joined First Division side Newcastle United. Signing in 1958 for a fee of \u00a328,000, he formed a prolific strike partnership with George Eastham and Len White. In 1962, he joined Cardiff City for \u00a318,000, where he spent three seasons before finishing his professional career with a second spell with Swansea Town. His two spells with Swansea saw him become the club's all-time top goalscorer.", "Allchurch's decision to leave the Swans saw a large amount of interest, with Liverpool offering to fly a private plane to South Wales and meet any valuation Swansea placed on him. Liverpool chairman Tom Williams and manager Phil Taylor also travelled to meet Allchurch but were rejected as he wished to move to a team in the First Division. Aston Villa had an offer accepted but Newcastle United chairman Alderman McKeag quickly offered an increased amount of \u00a328,000. On 10 October 1958, Allchurch travelled to Manchester to meet Newcastle manager Charlie Mitten where he was convinced to join Newcastle, signing his contract on a luggage trolley at Manchester Exchange railway station. Despite having never met his new teammates, he made his debut for the club, his first match in the First Division, the following day against Leicester City, scoring twice during a 3\u20131 victory. He joined the club's established strike partnership of George Eastham and Len White, the trio going on to score 48 of the club's 81 goals during the course of the 1958\u201359 season with Allchurch finishing as the club's second top scorer behind White despite missing more than a quarter of the season.", "The following season saw a tumultuous period for the club with Eastham submitting a transfer request and refusing to return to training after the club rejected his request. Allchurch himself submitted another rejected transfer request, this time due to his wish to return to South Wales in order for his wife Esme to be near her family during a new pregnancy following the loss of a child during her previous pregnancy. The club again started poorly and Mitten switched Allchurch from his usual inside-forward role to the number nine position in order to be used as the club's main striker in an attempt to improve results but Allchurch grew frustrated with the decision, backing Len White as the club's best centre-forward and even refusing to play on three occasions over the decision. Mitten eventually backed down and, following reassurance over his wife's condition, Allchurch withdrew his transfer request. Later in the season, following an injury to captain Jimmy Scoular, Allchurch was elected as the stand in captain by the squad. Teammate Bob Stokoe commented that \"there's no one better equipped for the job\". However, Newcastle were unable to turn their season around and suffered relegation to the Second Division in May 1961."]}, {"page": "History of Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["During the Fifties decade United lifted the FA Cup trophy on three occasions within a five-year period.
