From 1994 to 1995 the programme was contracted out to an independent production company Chrysalis after 28 years as an in-house BBC production. The programme ended its original run in 1997 after losing the rights to cover English domestic games, the Heineken Cup and England home tests to SKY and Welsh domestic matches to HTV/S4C the S4C involvement was controversial as BBC Wales was providing much of S4C's Welsh Language sports coverage under the BBC Cymru brand and was along with Ski Sunday merged into Sunday Grandstand in November 1997 when Sunday Grandstand became a year-round programme the first edition of the all year round Sunday Grandstand on 16 November 1997 featured live coverage of Wales v Tonga.

During the match at Twickenham, he played a part in Chico Hopkins' memorable appearance. When Gareth Edwards and Dennis both missed a tackle on Nigel Starmer-Smith, the two Wales players collided, resulting in an injury to Edwards who was unable to continue. This gave replacement Chico his one and only cap for his country. He took the field twenty minutes from full time and inspired the team to an impressive comeback. England had gained the upper hand and were winning 13 points to 6 until Chico made a try for JPR and followed up with a try of his own from the back of a lineout. Wales still needed a successful conversion to take a one point lead. JPR Williams duly obliged and Barry John added a drop goal well into a long injury time."]}, {"page": "1970 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Nigel Starmer-Smith"]}, {"page": "Starmer (surname)", "response": ["* Nigel Starmer-Smith (born 1944), English rugby union player, journalist and commentator"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Rugby Union County Championship", "response": ["|9 || Nigel Starmer-Smith || Harlequins"]}, {"page": "Vernon Pugh Award for Distinguished Service", "response": ["|align=left| Nigel Starmer-Smith"]}]}}
