He is best known as the writer of Cliff Richard's debut single \"Move It\", and his association with the rock band America, with whom he had his biggest commercial success with their hit single, \"A Horse with No Name\". He also worked with rock bands, such as the Small Faces, The Grateful Dead, Frank Zappa, Joni Mitchell, John Mayall and Hummingbird.\nSamwell wrote for many other British artists, including Joe Brown, Elkie Brooks, Kenny Lynch and Dusty Springfield. Several of his songs were recorded in Spanish by the Mexican group, Los Teen Tops and were released in Latin America and the Spanish-speaking territories of the world. He also worked as a record producer with Sounds Incorporated, Georgie Fame, John Mayall and the mod band The Small Faces, co-writing their 1965 hit single \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cliff Richard", "response": ["Harry Webb became lead singer of a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name). The 1950s entrepreneur Harry Greatorex wanted the up-and-coming rock 'n' roll singer to change his name. The name Cliff was adopted as it sounded like \"cliff face\", which suggested \"Rock\". It was \"Move It\" writer Ian Samwell who suggested the surname \"Richard\" as a tribute to Webb's musical hero Little Richard.", "Before their first large-scale appearance, at the Regal Ballroom in Ripley, Derbyshire in 1958, they adopted the name \"Cliff Richard and the Drifters\". The four members were Harry Webb (by then going under the stage name \"Cliff Richard\"), Ian Samwell on guitar, Terry Smart on drums and Norman Mitham on guitar. None of the other three played with the later and better known Shadows, although Samwell wrote songs for Richard's later career.

They were eventually taken on by producer Ian Samwell, best known for writing Cliff Richard's 1958 breakthrough hit \"Move It\", and his partner Jeff Dexter, and through their efforts, they were eventually contracted to Kinney Records (UK) in March 1971 by Ian Ralfini and assigned to the UK Warner Bros. label."]}, {"page": "John Mayall", "response": ["In 1956, with college fellow Peter Ward, Mayall had founded the Powerhouse Four which consisted of both men and other local musicians with whom they played at local dances. In 1962 Mayall became a member of the Blues Syndicate. The band was formed by trumpeter John Rowlands and alto saxophonist Jack Massarik, who had seen the Alexis Korner band at a Manchester club and wanted to try a similar blend of jazz and blues. It also included rhythm guitarist Ray Cummings and drummer Hughie Flint, whom Mayall already knew. In 1962 John and his band were frequent and popular artists at all night R&B sessions at the 'Twisted Wheel' cellar club in central Manchester. Alexis Korner persuaded Mayall to opt for a full-time musical career and move to London, where Korner introduced him to many other musicians and helped them to find gigs. In late 1963, with his band, which was now called the Bluesbreakers, Mayall started playing at the Marquee Club. The line-up was Mayall, Ward, John McVie on bass and guitarist Bernie Watson, formerly of Cyril Davies and the R&B All-Stars. The next spring Mayall obtained his first recording date with producer Ian Samwell. The band, with Martin Hart at the drums, recorded two tracks : \"Crawling Up a Hill\" as well as \"Mr. James\". Shortly after, Hughie Flint replaced Hart and Roger Dean took the guitar from Bernie Watson. This line-up backed John Lee Hooker on his British tour in 1964."]}, {"page": "Small Faces", "response": ["The band signed a management contract with management impresario Don Arden, and they were in turn signed to Decca Records for recording.

Marriott and Lane are credited with creating the instrumental to the song, \"borrowing\" the guitar riff from the Solomon Burke record \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\".

'Small Faces' was recorded over a lengthy (by the standard of the time) period of nine months, during the band's tenure on both Decca and Immediate Records, at two separate studios. It is their first LP to contain solely original compositions. Thirteen of the album's fourteen tracks were either written or co-written by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, in contrast to the group's 1966 debut, in which only seven of the twelve tracks are credited to the band, with the remaining tracks being written by artists such as Kenny Lynch and Ian Samwell, or being R&B covers that were parts of the group's early repertoire."]}, {"page": "Hank Marvin", "response": ["Marvin wrote \"Driftin'\", \"Geronimo\", \"Spider Juice\" (his daughter's name for orange juice), \"I Want You to Want Me\" for the Shadows, and \"The Day I Met Marie\".
