In 1924 he wrote most of the lyrics for the London musical Primrose, for which Gershwin wrote the music, his first commission outside the US. The musical was revived in 2003, when one reviewer wrote: \"...by far the most outstanding contribution to Primrose is the comedy lyrics of Desmond Carter, who penned the words to seventeen of the score's twenty-two songs and collaborated with Ira Gershwin on four of the remaining five. Two among them, \"Isn't It Horrible What They Did to Mary, Queen of Scots\" and \"That New Fangled Mother of Mine,\" shine with humor and wordplay worthy of Noel Coward.\"\nIn 1936, Carter wrote English lyrics for the song \"Gloomy Sunday\" (\"Szomor\u00fa vas\u00e1rnap\"), which had been written by Hungarian composer Rezs\u0151 Seress with lyrics by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 J\u00e1vor.  Carter's lyrics were performed and recorded by Paul Robeson, whose recording was successful although most later versions of the song used alternative lyrics by American writer Sam M. Lewis.Carter also collaborated with leading English popular composers of the period, including Ivor Novello and Noel Gay.  He died in London at the age of 43.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1936 in music", "response": ["* Over She Goes (Music: Billy Mayerl Lyrics: Desmond Carter & Frank Eyton Book: Stanley Lupino) London production opened at the Saville Theatre on September 23 and ran for 248 performances"]}, {"page": "1933 in music", "response": ["* \"I Took My Harp to a Party\"     w.

In 1992, Gal\u00e1s released the album Vena Cava, a series of unaccompanied voice pieces recorded in New York during a live performance at The Kitchen. For her next record, Gal\u00e1s changed stylistic direction by turning to the blues tradition and interpreting a wide range of songs with only a piano and solo voice. This stylistic turn produced the studio album The Singer (1992), on which she covered songs by Willie Dixon, Roy Acuff, and Screamin' Jay Hawkins, as well as \"Gloomy Sunday\", a song written by Hungarian pianist and composer Rezs\u0151 Seress in 1933 and translated into English by Desmond Carter.
