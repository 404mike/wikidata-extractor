He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler who played for Nottinghamshire. He is now a businessman.\nAfford made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire against Oxford University, during the 1984 season, appearing in single game during the 1984 County Championship season, but it wasn't until two years later that he would get a  regular first-team place, playing just two County Championship games during the 1985 season. He played in the Second XI Championship in 1987 and 1988 and returned to play several matches for the first team in 1989.\nAfford started the following season promisingly, making the selection for an England A fixture against Zimbabwe in 1990 which the team won by nine wickets. He finished the year being awarded his cap.\nIn 1991 the team's Second XI flourished, winning the Second XI Trophy with Afford putting in a strong bowling performance along the way to Nottinghamshire's top placing in the North Zone, and taking the wicket of Ali Brown in the final. Afford was now regularly partnered by former England Test spinner Eddie Hemmings.\nAfford took 468 first-class wickets, including hauls of 10 wickets in a match on two occasions, and five-wicket hauls on sixteen occasions, with his best haul of 6-51 coming against Lancashire.
