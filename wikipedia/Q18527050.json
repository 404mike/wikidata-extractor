His first appearance on the stage was at Gravesend, after which we worked at provincial theatres at Bath and Norwich. He went on to perform in London and was manager of the Theatre Royal, Haymarket. He was part of an extensive family of actors.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Plim Bellamy", "response": ["In 1810 the Suffolk Chronicle hired a corrosive new critic, up to which time the Norwich Company had been used to receiving a favourable press. For the summer season 1810 the \u2018Ipswich Theatre\u2019 was showing She Stoops to Conquer and the Chronicle reported \u2018The performance possessed all the worst defects of a provincial exhibition\u2019 and actor Frederick Vining was rapped for his \u2018schoolboy recitation\u2019 with the managers accused of having dredged up a miserable orchestra. Worse followed when the Chronicle sent the reporter to every following show and the reviews became more critical. After an uneasy truce Bellamy, who was playing Polonius in Hamlet in 1813, when the Chronicle reported \u2018We never saw a viler Polonius than Bellamy\u2019s\u2019 to which he replied with a pamphlet A Plain Letter to the Dramatic Censor of The Suffolk Chronicle (Ipswich 1814). By this time relations between the Company and the newspaper had further deteriorated. The critic was identified as Thomas Harral and after an uproar at the play The Maid of the Mill, Harral, on leaving the theatre, was attacked in Tankard [Tacket] Street, Ipswich by Vining and his friends, when his coat was ripped from his back and he narrowly escaped a ducking. His critical spleen unsettled some of the actors and in May 1815 Vining left for Covent Garden and Bellamy followed shortly afterwards but returned as manager of the Norwich circuit three years later."]}, {"page": "Fanny Vining Davenport", "response": ["Fanny Elizabeth Vining was born in London July 6, 1829, into a large theatrical family.
