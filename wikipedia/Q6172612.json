Jed left the band making way for his cousin, Brian Nash (known as Nasher) before the band's first album. However, Jed re-joined the band for its worldwide tours in 1984 and 1987 as the 6th Frankie.For the band's 2004 reunion, Jed has replaced Nasher as the band's lead guitarist. The guitar he used during the tour of the reunion belonged to Vin O'Toole, one of his other brothers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frankie Goes to Hollywood", "response": ["The nucleus of the group emerged from the late 1970s Liverpool punk scene. Lead singer Johnson had played bass with Big in Japan and had also released two solo singles. Local musicians Peter Gill (drums), Jed O'Toole (bass), and O'Toole's cousin Brian Nash (guitar) initially joined Johnson, calling themselves Sons and Egypt. This line-up secured a number of small local gigs before disbanding.", "The group was reprised when Johnson joined Mark O'Toole (bass) and Peter \"Ped\" Gill to form FGTH. During a particularly fluid period of personnel changes, Jed O'Toole joined FGTH on guitar, and a female vocalist, Sonia Mazumder, was also a band member for the first Frankie gig at the Leeds nightclub \"The Warehouse\", supporting Hambi & The Dance. Paul Rutherford\u2014a member of the headline act who had also sung in seminal Liverpool punk band The Spitfire Boys\u2014apparently got so caught up in Frankie's performance that he effectively replaced Mazumder that very night. The new all-male musical line-up subsequently toured locally with a leather-clad female duo known as \"The Leatherpets\" and managed to fund promotional videos and demos, despite being eventually turned down by both Arista Records and Phonogram Inc. In October 1982, the group recorded a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, comprising the originals \"Krisco Kisses\", \"Two Tribes\", \"Disneyland\", and \"The World Is My Oyster\". Around this time Jed O'Toole left the group, to be replaced by the returning Brian Nash.", "In 2004, a celebration of the 25th anniversary of Trevor Horn's involvement in the music industry a special concert took place at Wembley Arena in November, featuring three of the original FGTH line-up, Mark O'Toole, Peter (Ped) Gill and Paul Rutherford and another former member, Jed O'Toole. Original vocalist Johnson, who announced via the Internet that he would not be appearing, and guitarist Nash, who declined to appear for his own reasons, did not take part. Jed O'Toole took over guitar duties for the event, whilst an open audition was held for a new singer for the concert. Ryan Molloy was recruited as a result.", "* Jed O'Toole \u2013 vocals, guitars (1980\u20131982, 1984, 1987, 2004\u20132007)"]}, {"page": "O'Toole (surname)", "response": ["* Jed O'Toole, American musician"]}]}}
