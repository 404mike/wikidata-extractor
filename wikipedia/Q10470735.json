He played as a centre forward.\nRegan was born in Worcester. He played football from age 11 until 16 at the Sacred Heart College in Droitwich and went on to WRGS for A-levels. Royal Grammar School being a rugby-playing establishment, Birmingham City's scouts spotted him with his junior club. He signed for Birmingham in 1959, initially as an amateur, and turned professional two years later. Regan scored the opening goal on his debut in the First Division on 13 October 1962, deputising for Jimmy Harris in a home game against Manchester City which finished as a 2\u20132 draw. He played once more that season and three times in 1963\u201364, scoring one more goal, and was allowed to leave in October 1964, aged still only 20, to join Shrewsbury Town of the Third Division. He went on to play for Brentford, Crewe Alexandra and Doncaster Rovers, scoring regularly but not prolifically, and then moved into non-league football with Bromsgrove Rovers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1969\u201370 Football League", "response": ["|=||align=left|  John Regan ||align=left| Doncaster Rovers ||12||0||0||12"]}, {"page": "John Regan", "response": ["John Regan may refer to:", "* John Regan (bassist)", "* John Regan (footballer) (b. 1944)", "* John Regan (rapper), American rapper", "* General John Regan (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Bobby Ross (footballer, born 1942)", "response": ["Ross joined Third Division club Brentford in a \u00a39,500 double deal with Shrewsbury Town teammate John Regan in March 1966.

In the Fourth Division, Ross quickly established himself as regular first team player, making 53 appearances and scoring 9 league goals during the 1966\u201367 season and winning the London Challenge Cup.

Ross registered his first double-digit tally of goals for the club during the 1969\u201370 season, scoring 13 league goals and appearing in all 46 league games.

Three consecutive defeats in early April left the supporters clamouring for Cavanagh's head and despite a brief respite after a 2\u20130 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion, a 5\u20130 defeat away to Exeter City on 16 April led chairman Jack Dunnett to dispense with Cavanagh's services.

Manager Billy Gray then made wholesale changes to the starting XI, introducing a number of youngsters, with the new-look team going on to win five consecutive matches. The establishment of the new lineup led to a clearout of players, with out-of-favour Micky Block, Billy Cobb, John Regan, Mel Scott and Ron Crisp all exiting Griffin Park before the end of the season. The Bees failed to keep up their good form through November and December and dropped back into mid-table. The team weathered the storm caused by the tumultuous events of 19 January 1967, which resulted in the departure of chairman Jack Dunnett and manager Billy Gray. Trainer Jimmy Sirrel took over as acting manager and built on the improved January form under Gray and led the team on a 16-match unbeaten league run, which equalled the club record at the time.
