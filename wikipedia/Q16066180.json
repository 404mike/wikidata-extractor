Promoted to post-captain and given a frigate to command, he operated in the Mediterranean and performed services for the nobles and monarchs of the Italian states. Downman went on to command several ships of the line, often as a flag-captain, and took part in the capture of the Cape Colony and operations on the R\u00edo de la Plata.\nLeft without active employment after the end of the wars with France, he briefly returned to service in 1824. before being promoted to flag rank the following year.
