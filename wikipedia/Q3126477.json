He was the eldest son of Rev. Henry Clark of Harmston, Lincolnshire. His first schooling was at the Beverly Grammar School after which he studied with the Rev. Scott who ignited his interest in natural history. Hamlet was a sickly child and avoided strenuous activities. He enrolled at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and studied under the coleopterist Thomas Vernon Wollaston (Jesus College, Cambridge). Cambridge's tuition in natural history at that time was not of a high standard, but Clark devised his own reading list and purchased specimens from local residents. His interests during that period were birds, spiders, and Lepidoptera. Later on he devoted his time to Coleoptera, in particular the water and leaf beetles.\nClark published his first article 'Captures near Towcester' in Ent., 1, 1842, pp. 409\u2013410. He followed up with notes on specimens from Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and at Whittlesea Mere, and in 1855 with 'Synonymic list of the British carnivorous water beetles, together with critical remarks and notices of foreign allied species' (Zoo., 14, pp. 4846\u20134869). 'A synonymic list of the British species of Philhydrida' appeared the following year in the same journal. He collaborated with John Frederic Dawson on a revision of the classification and taxonomy of the British Carabidae. After this date Clark worked almost exclusively on foreign beetles. A world catalogue of Phytophaga, a joint work with Henry Walter Bates, was unfinished at his death, only the first part having been published in 1866.\nClark collected extensively throughout Great Britain. In 1856 he joined John Edward Gray on a two-month cruise to Spain and Algeria. In December of the same year he accompanied Gray once again on a trip to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clark", "response": ["* Hamlet Clark (1823\u20131867), English entomologist"]}, {"page": "John Edward Gray", "response": ["Gray was a friend of coleopterist Hamlet Clark, and in 1856\u201357 they sailed on Gray's yacht Miranda to Spain, Algeria, and Brazil. Gray was an accomplished watercolourist, and his landscape paintings illustrate Clark's account of their journeys."]}, {"page": "Platycorynus", "response": ["The generic name \"Platycorynus\" first appeared in the second and third editions of Dejean's Catalogue of Coleoptera, where it was attributed to Chevrolat. Nine species were listed for the genus, four of which were nomina nuda at the time of publication, but no formal description was given for it. The genus was later briefly characterized by Frederick William Hope in 1840, under the new name \"Corynodes\". In 1865, Thomas Ansell Marshall published a monograph on Corynodes, dividing it into seven subgenera: Platycorynus, Corynodes, Theumorus, Eurycorynus, Omodon, Erigenes, and Bathycolpus. The latter five were originally intended to be new genera. In the same year, Hamlet Clark created a new genus, Corynoeides, for one of the species placed in Corynodes. However, Joseph Sugar Baly did not accept Clark's genus nor Marshall's subdivisions. In 1956, Monr\u00f3s & Bechyn\u00e9 pointed out that Platycorynus Chevrolat in Dejean, 1836 was available and had priority over Corynodes Hope, 1840, and that therefore the former should be used as the valid name for the genus."]}, {"page": "Ajubus", "response": ["Ajubus is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It contains only one species, Ajubus viridis, described from Champion Bay in Western Australia. The genus was originally named Thaumastomerus by Hamlet Clark in 1865; however, this name was preoccupied by Thaumastomerus Wollaston, 1861 (a beetle genus in Curculionidae), so it was renamed to Ajubus by N. A. Aslam in 1968."]}]}}
