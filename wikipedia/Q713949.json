Many of Schoenberg's practices, including the formalization of compositional method and his habit of openly inviting audiences to think analytically, are echoed in avant-garde musical thought throughout the 20th century. His often polemical views of music history and aesthetics were crucial to many significant 20th-century musicologists and critics, including Theodor W. Adorno, Charles Rosen, and Carl Dahlhaus, as well as the pianists Artur Schnabel, Rudolf Serkin, Eduard Steuermann, and Glenn Gould.", "Following the death in 1924 of composer Ferruccio Busoni, who had served as Director of a Master Class in Composition at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, Schoenberg was appointed to this post the next year, but because of health problems was unable to take up his post until 1926. Among his notable students during this period were the composers Robert Gerhard, Nikos Skalkottas, and Josef Rufer."]}, {"page": "Second Viennese School", "response": ["The principal members of the school, besides Schoenberg, were Alban Berg and Anton Webern, who were among his first composition pupils. Both of them had already produced copious and talented music in a late Romantic idiom but felt they gained new direction and discipline from Schoenberg's teaching.

More unusually, the Concerto for Piano and Strings by Robert Gerhard featured in his repertoire. He also appeared as accompanist to Alexander Kipnis in Schubert's Winterreise (at the age of 18) and as chamber musician, playing with Henryk Szeryng (violin) and Ernesto Xanc\u00f3 (cello) in duos, and with both artists in trios.", "Ferber was most active as a solo recitalist, the pianist's repertoire being extensive and wide-ranging. In addition to standard works by J. S. Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Schubert, Ferber played many lesser-known twentieth century works such as the piano sonatas by Ernest Bloch, Frank Bridge and Robert Simpson, and Robert Gerhard's Don Quixote suite. In July 1947 he gave the first performance of Lennox Berkeley's Six Preludes for Piano at Broadcasting House and in May 1951 premiered Gerhard's Three Impromptus at the Wigmore Hall. Even when playing works by mainstream composers, Ferber tended to avoid the obvious and introduced audiences to comparative rarities such as Beethoven's Variations on Salieri's La Stessa, la Stessissima, Chopin's Variations on a German Folksong and Schumann's Sonata No. 3. However, the artist was especially drawn to French repertoire, in particular the music of Gabriel Faur\u00e9 and Claude Debussy, whose \u0153uvre often featured in his concerts. His recital programmes were always imaginative and varied, often structured around collections of shorter items rather than major works, though the latter were included."]}, {"page": "Richard Van Allan", "response": ["In his later career, his performances became less frequent.  However, he continued to tackle new roles.  He created the role of Tiresias in the world premiere of John Buller's The Bacchae (1992) with English National Opera.  Also in 1992, he sang the role of Davenant in The Vampyr: A Soap Opera, a television miniseries based on Heinrich Marschner's opera Der Vampyr. In 1994 at the English National Opera, he sang the title role in Massenet's Don Quichotte for the first time.  Also at ENO, he sang the Man Without a Conscience in Nigel Osborne's Goya opera Terrible Mouth, and King Hildebrand in Ken Russell's much criticised production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Princess Ida. He performed in Madrid as Don Jerome in the first staged performances of Robert Gerhard's The Duenna, and in Florence as Swallow in Peter Grimes.  At Glyndebourne, he played the comic speaking role of Frosch in Die Fledermaus in the autumn of 2006.

Gerhard brilliantly develops, combines and transforms these resources along with new systematic processes created by himself, so that it leads to a new and broad theoretical framework that will be essential to his music thereafter.", "Robert Gerhard began writing this string quartet in 1951 in Cambridge, where he lived in exile since 1939 as a result of Franco's dictatorship, within a significant historical and personal context. He had been one of the most important disciples (from the few who remained alive) of Arnold Schoenberg, who died in the same year of 1951. At the same moment, the twelve-tone compositional technique of the avant-garde in the interwar period defended by Schoenberg was replaced by integral serialism, led by Pierre Boulez.", "The temporal difference between the beginning of the compositional process of the work and the end, although based on the same twelve-note sequence, creates a stylistic separation between movements 1\u20132 and 3\u20134.
