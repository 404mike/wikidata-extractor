Some sources say that he was born of British stock in Armorican Domnonia.\nAaron was a Welshman who lived alone near Lamballe and Pleumeur-Gautier, before finally settling in Aleth. He attracted many visitors while there, including Malo, it is said, in 544, and became their abbot. He died soon afterwards. Malo then succeeded to the spiritual rule of the district subsequently known as Saint-Malo, and was consecrated first Bishop of Aleth. Aaron's feast day is 21 June (at Saint-Malo) or 22 June (elsewhere). He is mentioned in Les Vies des Saints de Bretagne.The town of Saint Sarah\nin Lamballe, France is named after him.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 22", "response": ["** Aaron of Aleth"]}, {"page": "June 22 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)", "response": ["* Saint Aaron of Aleth (Aihran, Eran), hermit, monk and abbot at a monastery on C\u00e9zembre, a small island near Aleth, opposite Saint-Malo in Brittany, France (c.552) ", "File:Saint Aaron.jpg|St. Aaron of Aleth."]}, {"page": "List of Catholic saints", "response": ["|  Aaron of Aleth"]}, {"page": "St. Aaron", "response": ["#redirectAaron of Aleth"]}, {"page": "Category talk:French saints", "response": ["Aaron of AlethStub"]}, {"page": "Category talk:British saints", "response": ["Aaron of AlethStub"]}, {"page": "Aaron (given name)", "response": ["*Aaron of Aleth (died 552), 6th-century saint"]}, {"page": "Saint Aaron", "response": ["#REDIRECT Aaron of Aleth"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Ancient Christian denominations", "response": ["Aaron of AlethStub"]}, {"page": "Les Vies des Saints de Bretagne", "response": ["*21 - Aaron of Aleth", "*22 - Aaron of Aleth"]}, {"page": "Harbour Island", "response": ["*Harbour Island, a fortified islet off Sant-Malo\u00f9/Saint-Malo, Brittany, where Aaron of Aleth welcomed Saint Malo in the 5th century"]}, {"page": "Saint-Aaron", "response": ["Saint-Aaron is a village in the commune of Lamballe, in Brittany, a region of France.
