Even more of a shock, including (allegedly) to Queen Victoria herself, was the inscription on the obverse, , omitting the usual  for Dei Gratia (By the Grace of God) from the coin's inscription. This resulted in it being known as the \"Godless florin\". Further controversy was caused by the omission of the usual abbreviation  for Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith): the Master of the Mint, Richard Lalor Sheil, an Irishman and a Roman Catholic, was suspected by some of plotting to overthrow the Protestant regime. The inscription had in fact been suggested by Albert, Prince Consort, Victoria's husband.

Duncombe suggested that the Foreign Office had then passed the information to the Neapolitan court through a link with the Austrian authorities. When the group landed at the pre-arranged place, they were instantly killed. Although a secret committee convened at Parliament's request exonerated the government, the discussion was renewed in the following session, after Richard Lalor Sheil censured the government for its actions. Graham vigorously defended his actions, stating that the Secretary of State had been invested by Parliament with the power, in certain cases, of issuing warrants directing letters to be opened. The division took place in a very thin house and the government survived by a mere 16 votes. The events haunted Graham for the rest of his life; as he told his nephew, \"he knew, when he was gone, none of his reforms would be recollected, but that he would only be remembered as the man who opened the letters of the Italians.\"Russell, page 24"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1837\u20131901)", "response": ["*Richard Lalor Sheil (1791\u20131851)"]}, {"page": "Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces", "response": ["*26 June 1841: Richard Lalor Sheil"]}, {"page": "Lalor", "response": ["* Richard Lalor Sheil (1791\u20131851), politician, writer and orator"]}, {"page": "Second Melbourne ministry", "response": ["| Richard Lalor Sheil", "| Richard Lalor Sheil"]}, {"page": "Deputy President of the Board of Trade", "response": ["|Richard Lalor Sheil || 29 August 1839 || 28 June 1841"]}, {"page": "List of Kilkenny people", "response": ["* Richard Lalor Sheil (1791\u20131851), politician, writer and orator"]}, {"page": "Catholic Association", "response": ["The Catholic Association was originally aristocratic in its composition, and some of the gentry (Such as Richard Lalor Sheil) held relatively conservative views.
