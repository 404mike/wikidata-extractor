The first undersea cable was laid in 1850, connecting the two countries and was followed by connections to Ireland and the Low Countries."]}, {"page": "Telegraphy", "response": ["A worldwide communication network meant that telegraph cables would have to be laid across oceans. On land cables could be run uninsulated suspended from poles. Underwater, a good insulator that was both flexible and capable of resisting the ingress of seawater was required, and at first this was not available. A solution presented itself with gutta-percha, a natural rubber from the Palaquium gutta tree, after William Montgomerie sent samples to London from Singapore in 1843. The new material was tested by Michael Faraday and in 1845 Wheatstone suggested that it should be used on the cable planned between Dover and Calais by John Watkins Brett. The idea was proved viable when the South Eastern Railway company successfully tested a  gutta-percha insulated cable with telegraph messages to a ship off the coast of Folkstone. The cable to France was laid in 1850 but was almost immediately severed by a French fishing vessel.Solymar, Laszlo.

It was simply a copper wire coated with gutta-percha, without any other protection, and was not successful.The company is referred to as the English Channel Submarine Telegraph Company However, the experiment served to secure renewal of the concession, and in September 1851, a protected core, or true, cable was laid by the reconstituted Submarine Telegraph Company from a government hulk, Blazer, which was towed across the Channel."]}, {"page": "Fleeming Jenkin", "response": ["In the spring of 1855, he was fitting out the S.S. Elba at Birkenhead for his first telegraph cruise. Earlier in 1855, John Watkins Brett had attempted to lay a cable across the Mediterranean between Cape Spartivento, in the south of Sardinia, and a point near Bona, on the coast of Algeria. It was a gutta-percha cable of six wires or conductors, manufactured by Glass, Elliott & Co., a firm which afterwards combined with the Gutta-Percha Company and became the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company. Brett laid the cable from the Result, a sailing ship in tow, instead of a more manageable steamer. Meeting with 600 fathoms (1100 m) of water when twenty-five miles (45\u00a0km) from land, the cable ran out so fast that a tangled skein came up out of the hold and the line had to be severed. Having only  on board to span the whole distance of , he grappled the lost cable near the shore, raised it, and under-ran or passed it over the ship, for some , then cut it, leaving the seaward end on the bottom. He then spliced the ship's cable to the shoreward end and resumed paying-out but after  in all were laid, another rapid rush of cable took place, and Brett was obliged to cut and abandon the line."]}, {"page": "Transatlantic telegraph cable", "response": ["In 1855, Field crossed the Atlantic, the first of 56 crossings in the course of the project,Lindley, p. 127 to consult with John Watkins Brett, the greatest authority on submarine cables at the time. Brett's Submarine Telegraph Company laid the first ocean cable in 1850 across the English Channel, and his English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company had laid a cable to Ireland in 1853, the deepest cable to that date.Bright, p. 14  Further reasons for the trip were that all the commercial manufacturers of submarine cable were in Britain, and Field had failed to raise significant funds for the project in New York."]}, {"page": "Second Industrial Revolution", "response": ["The rapid expansion of telegraph networks took place throughout the century, with the first undersea cable being built by John Watkins Brett between France and England."]}, {"page": "Charles Tilston Bright", "response": ["Joining with Cyrus West Field and John Watkins Brett, who controlled the New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, Bright helped organise the Atlantic Telegraph Company in 1856 to develop a transatlantic cable, with himself as engineer-in-chief; Wildman Whitehouse soon joined them as chief electrician.

The board of directors was composed of eighteen members from the United Kingdom, nine from the United States and three from Canada. The original three projectors were joined by E.O.W.

The line ran south along the east coast, partly on land, partly on sea, from Cap Corse to Ajaccio, where a second cable crossed the Strait of Bonifacio. Brett's intended links across Sardinia and through the deeps to Bona, Algeria, failed because of decimation of the crews by malaria and the technical difficulties of laying cable in deep waters.

The Magnetic finally succeeded in 1853, giving Ireland a telegraphic connection to Britain for the first time, and through Britain to mainland Europe. This was the deepest submarine cable laid to date.Bright, p. 14", "London District Telegraph Company (the District), formed in 1859 in London, was closely associated with the Magnetic. John Watkins Brett and Charles Kemp Dyer were directors of both companies; Edward Brailsford Bright was secretary of both. Their telegraph operators were trained at the Magnetic's headquarters in the Strand.Kieve, p. 56 The Magnetic installed the telegraph lines for the District and leased them back for a peppercorn rent in exchange for the District passing on the Magnetic's messages to and from outside London.Kieve, p. 59 The District's business model was to provide cheap telegrams within London and not install expensive links between cities. Prices were fourpence (1.7p) for ten words and sixpence (2.5p) for fifteen.Kieve, p. 56 By comparison, a long distance telegram on the Electric cost four shillings (20p).Kieve, p. 53 The District's area was limited to within  of Charing Cross, with possible later expansion to . The District avoided the expense of erecting telegraph poles or burying cables by stringing the wires from building to building, a technique that could only be used in heavily built-up areas.Kieve, p. 56", "The world's first ocean cable was laid across the English Channel.  Jacob and John Watkins Brett had been planning such a cable since 1847.Haigh, p. 192  In 1849, the South Eastern Railway Company conducted a trial of  of cable made by the Gutta Percha Company from the ship Princess Clementine anchored off Folkestone.  The ship could send telegraph messages directly to London via a connection to the South Eastern's overhead telegraph line.Kieve, p. 102  After several failed attempts, the Bretts' company, the Submarine Telegraph Company (STC), succeeded in connecting to France in 1851.
