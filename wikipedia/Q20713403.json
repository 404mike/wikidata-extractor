He then joined Welsh National Opera's \"Opera for All\", to tour for two years. He played more than a dozen Gilbert and Sullivan roles with the D'Oyly Carte continuously from 1971 to 1979, also recording most of these roles with the company.\nAfterwards, he had a brief government service career and sang on the concert stage. He worked with several more Gilbert and Sullivan companies for three more decades, playing some of his old D'Oyly Carte roles and more than a dozen new ones. He also appeared with Hinge and Bracket and on cruise ships, and he performed his own autobiographical musical show.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Sergeant||Richard Watson||Kenneth Sandford||George Cook||Michael Rayner||Clive Harre"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|Pish-Tush||Jeffrey Skitch||Thomas Lawlor||Michael Rayner||Peter Lyon"]}, {"page": "Iolanthe", "response": ["|Strephon||Alan Styler||Thomas Lawlor||Michael Rayner||Peter Lyon"]}, {"page": "H.M.S.
