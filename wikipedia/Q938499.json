Some have suggested that he was born in 1579 because he was admitted to the London Charterhouse in 1629, a prerequisite to which was being at least 50 years old, though there is no certainty over this. He had made his living as a professional soldier, serving as an officer with the Swedish and Russian armies.His published music includes pieces for viols (including many solo works for the lyra viol) and songs. They were gathered in two collections, The First Part of Ayres (or Musicall Humors, 1605) and Captain Humes Poeticall Musicke (1607). He was a particular champion of the viol over the then-dominant lute, something which caused John Dowland to publish a rebuttal of Hume's ideas.\nHume was also known as a prankster, as some of his somewhat unusual compositions illustrate. His most notorious piece was \"An Invention for Two to Play upone one Viole\", also known as Prince's Almayne. Two bows are required and the smaller of the two players is obliged to sit in the lap of the larger player. This work was notated in tablature and is indeed technically possible to play. His instructions to \"drum this with the backe of your bow\" in another piece, \"Harke, harke,\" from the First Part of Ayres, constitute the earliest known use of col legno in Western music.At Christmas 1629 he entered Charterhouse as a poor brother. His mind seems to have given way, for in July 1642 he published a rambling True Petition of Colonel Hume to parliament offering either to defeat the rebels in Ireland with a hundred 'instruments of war,' or, if furnished with a complete navy, to bring the king within three months twenty millions of money. He styles himself 'colonel,' but the rank was probably of his own invention, for in the entry of his death, which took place at Charterhouse on Wednesday, 16 April 1645, he is still called Captain Hume.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 16", "response": ["*1645 \u2013 Tobias Hume, Scottish soldier, viol player, and composer (b. 1569)"]}, {"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Tobias Hume (c.1579\u20131645)"]}, {"page": "Viol", "response": ["Viols were second in popularity only to the lute (although this is disputed), and like lutes, were very often played by amateurs. Affluent homes might have a so-called chest of viols, which would contain one or more instruments of each size. Gamba ensembles, called consorts, were common in the 16th and 17th centuries, when they performed vocal music (consort songs or verse anthems) as well as that written specifically for instruments. Only the treble, tenor, and bass sizes were regular members of the viol consort, which consisted of three, four, five, or six instruments. Music for consorts was very popular in England in Elizabethan times, with composers such as William Byrd and John Dowland, and, during the reign of King Charles I, John Jenkins, William Lawes and Tobias Hume. The last music for viol consorts before their modern revival was probably written in the early 1680s by Henry Purcell.", "Viola da gamba, viola cum arculo, and vihuela de arco are some (true) alternative names for viols. Both \"vihuela\" and \"viola\" were originally used in a fairly generic way, having included even early violins (viola da braccio) under their umbrella. It is common enough (and justifiable) today for modern players of the viola da gamba to call their instruments violas and likewise to call themselves violists. That the \"alto violin\" eventually became known simply as the \"viola\" is not without historical context, yet the ambiguity of the name tends to cause some confusion. The violin, or violino, was originally the soprano viola da braccio, or violino da braccio. Due to the popularity of the soprano violin, the entire consort eventually took on the name \"violin family\". Some other names for viols include viole or violle (French). In Elizabethan English, the word \"gambo\" (for gamba) appears in many permutations; e.g., \"viola de gambo\", \"gambo violl\", \"viol de gambo\", or \"viole de gambo\", used by such notables as Tobias Hume, John Dowland, and William Shakespeare in Twelfth Night. Viol da Gamba and Gamba also appear as string family stops on the pipe organ. These stops are sounds created by organ pipes made to imitate the sound of the viol da gamba."]}, {"page": "1569", "response": ["** Tobias Hume, English composer (d. 1645)"]}, {"page": "1645", "response": ["* April 16 \u2013 Tobias Hume, English composer (b. 1559)"]}, {"page": "Pizzicato", "response": ["The first recognised use of pizzicato in classical music is found in Tobias Hume's Captain Humes Poeticall Musicke (1607), wherein he instructs the viola da gamba player to use pizzicato ().
