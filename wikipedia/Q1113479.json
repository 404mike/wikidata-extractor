A professor and chair of the astronomy department at Boston University in the United States, he published in 1963 an analysis of Stonehenge in which he was the first to propose that it was an ancient astronomical observatory used to predict movements of the sun and moon, and that it was used as a computer.  Archaeologists and other scholars have since demonstrated such sophisticated, complex planning and construction at other prehistoric earthwork sites, such as Cahokia in the United States.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Archaeoastronomy", "response": ["In the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer Gerald Hawkins, who proposed that Stonehenge was a Neolithic computer,Hawkins 1976 inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed,Atkinson 1966 but this was not the case for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of megalithic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles.Thom 1988:9\u201310 Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate winter solstice site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon stone circle in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain.MacKie 1977 In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence.Gingerich 2000 Nevertheless, Thom's legacy remains strong, Edwin C. KruppKrupp 1979:18 wrote in 1979, \"Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades.\" His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.Hicks 1993Iwaniszewski 1995"]}, {"page": "Great Yarmouth", "response": ["*Gerald Hawkins (1928\u20132003) astronomer and author working on archaeoastronomyThe Guardian, 24 July 2003, Obituary, Gerald Hawkins.

In his book Stonehenge Decoded, Hawkins argued that the various features at the Stonehenge monument were arranged in such a way to predict a variety of astronomical events. He believed that the key to the holes' purpose was the lunar eclipse, which occurs on average about once a year on a 346.62\u00a0day cycle. Lunar eclipses are not always visible as the moon may be below the horizon as it moves across the sky, but over 18 to 19\u00a0years (18.61\u00a0years to be precise) the date and position of a visible eclipse will return to its beginning point on the horizon again. As the motion of the moon's orbit also causes it to work its way across the sky on an 18.61\u00a0year cycle in what is known as the journey between major and minor standstill and back, the theory that this period was both measurable and useful to Neolithic peoples seemed attractive.", "On astronomical symbolism several analysts from Gerald Hawkins to Anthony Johnson have noted that Plutarch reported that Set in Egyptian myth or Typhon in Greek myth was identified as the shadow of the Earth which covers the Moon during lunar eclipses. Plutarch further records that the Pythagoreans symbolically associated Typhon with a polygon of 56\u00a0sides, hence the connection of 56 to lunar eclipses is explicit, at least for the Hellenistic era."]}, {"page": "List of University of Nottingham people", "response": ["* Gerald Hawkins \u2013 Professor of Astronomy, noted for his interest in Stonehenge"]}, {"page": "Accelerating change", "response": ["== Gerald Hawkins' Mindsteps =="]}, {"page": "Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge", "response": ["An archaeoastronomy debate was triggered by the 1963 publication of Stonehenge Decoded, by Gerald Hawkins an American astronomer.

Even so, he made some significant finds and several of the mummies he found were placed in Peruvian museums by professional archaeologists.
