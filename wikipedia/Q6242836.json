The exercise required a long approach march from an assembly area and the crossing of a defended obstacle, the Kennet and Avon Canal. The exercise was to begin at  on 19 September against the 1st Infantry Division (Major-General John Kennedy), which left only four hours of darkness, insufficient for the move to be completed before daybreak. Lindsay had no command staff and several members of the Tank Brigade and the 7th Infantry Brigade staffs were at odds. The first plan was for an advance on a wide front with mixed units of armoured cars, light tanks, motorised infantry and the Vickers Medium Tanks. The faster vehicles would arrive at the canal and seize crossings for the medium tanks to cross as they arrived. The raids would begin at dawn on the next day; Hobart rejected plan because it required the division of the Tank Brigade into mixed columns."]}, {"page": "List of members of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders", "response": ["*Major-General Sir John Kennedy GBE CB CMG DSO, (1878-1948)"]}, {"page": "1946 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Major-General Sir John Kennedy, , Vice-Chairman, Executive Committee of the Joint War Organisation of the British Red Cross Society and Order of St. John"]}, {"page": "1937 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Major-General John Kennedy,  Retired Pay, Colonel, The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)."]}, {"page": "John Kennedy (British Army officer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Kennedy (British Army officer, born 1878)"]}, {"page": "General Kennedy", "response": ["*John Kennedy (British Army officer, born 1878) (1878\u20131948), British Army major general", "*John Kennedy (British Army officer, born 1893) (1893\u20131970), British Army major general"]}]}}
