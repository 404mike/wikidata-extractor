Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager observes,  \"Andersen's diaries leave no doubt that he was attracted to both sexes; that at times he longed for a physical relationship with a woman and that other times he was involved in physical liaisons with men.\" Andersen biographer Alison Prince comments, \"It is obvious that Andersen struggled throughout his life with a painful sense of greatness and of being different from others. This was partly due to the suppressed homosexuality which set him apart in loneliness and forced him to take refuge in the safer and more conventional image of the talented and hypersensitive poet...\" Both believe \"The Snowman\" has its source and inspiration in Andersen's relationship with a young male ballet dancer associated with the Royal Theater in Copenhagen.", "Andersen referred to \"The Snowman\" as a simple fairy tale, but the story may be viewed as a metaphor for life. The Snowman remains frozen to the ground, questioning fate, existence, and all that he sees and experiences. In this respect, the Snowman shares a common bond with Hamlet\u2014both grope for what is hidden, for the real behind the surface. But there the similarities end. Scholars Jackie Wullschlager and Alison Prince argue that Andersen's tales are expressions of his homosexuality, and Graham Robb author of Strangers: Homosexual Love in the 19th Century calls his work an \"Aesop of 19th-century homosexuality\". and many of his heroes the victims of an unpopular sexual preference.  \"The Snowman\" is a tale about misguided love, about a snowman who falls in love with what he believes is a female stove, and is Andersen's best argument for the price paid for falling in love with the wrong type\u2013with the stove representing the danger in this \"wrong\" relationship. Andersen spent a lifetime seeking validation by women and experienced only the pain of unreciprocated love. His diaries reveal Andersen resorted to masturbation as a sexual outlet, and one critic notes that \"[Andersen] so fabulously struck out with the ladies that it seems he simply expanded his dating pool to men to hedge his bets.\"", "Andersen biographer Alison Prince believes the tale to be a parable representing the different kinds of love. When the Snowman asks the dog why a young man and woman stroll about the wintry garden hand-in-hand, the disillusioned old dog tells him the two are engaged and will soon be moving into \"the same kennel together and sharing each other's bones\". The Snowman has a different idea of love, being enamored of the stove. Prince considers the image of the poker found within the Snowman's remains \"a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems inconceiveable.\""]}, {"page": "My Royal Story", "response": ["* Catherine of Aragon, London, 1501 by Alison Prince (2010)", "* Anne Boleyn and Me:A Tudor Girl's Diary, London, 1525 by Alison Prince (2010)", "* Henry VIII's Wives by Alison Prince (2011)"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Goldsmiths, University of London", "response": ["*Alison Prince"]}, {"page": "Children's Film Unit", "response": ["How's Business (1991) Adapted from the book by Alison Prince, this wartime drama follows young Howard Grainger as he is evacuated from London during the Blitz and relocated to the countryside, where he begins a series of schemes to try and accrue sufficient funds to return home.
