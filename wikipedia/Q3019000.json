Yannes criticized other contemporary computer sound chips as \"primitive, obviously\u00a0... designed by people who knew nothing about music\". Often the game music has become a hit of its own among C64 users. Well-known composers and programmers of game music on the C64 are Rob Hubbard, Jeroen Tel, Tim Follin, David Whittaker, Chris H\u00fclsbeck, Ben Daglish, Martin Galway, Kjell Nordb\u00f8 and David Dunn among many others. Due to the chip's three channels, chords are often played as arpeggios, coining the C64's characteristic lively sound. It was also possible to continuously update the master volume with sampled data to enable the playback of 4-bit digitized audio. As of 2008, it became possible to play four channel 8-bit audio samples, 2 SID channels and still use filtering."]}, {"page": "ZX Spectrum", "response": ["A number of notable games developers began their careers on the ZX Spectrum, including David Perry of Shiny Entertainment, and Tim and Chris Stamper (founders of Rare, formerly Ultimate Play the Game, maker of many games for Nintendo and Microsoft game consoles).

CU Amiga magazine expressed disappointment over the major change in the gameplay and the protagonist himself from the game's predecessor. The review also criticized sharply the game's poor graphics and character sprites, saying that \"many of the characters are short and stumpy\", that the background resembles that of Boulder Dash, and that Wonder Boy \"is as wide as he is tall\". Other criticisms included substandard screen scrolling, terrible gameplay due to the game's slowness, and that the actual gameplay area has been drastically reduced in size to include gameplay statistics such as the life meter and score displays. IGN heavily criticized the Amiga version 20 years after its release, saying how Wonder Boy was depicted as \"a diaper-clad baby\". Amiga Format similarly gave the game poor ratings, including the small gameplay area as a result of displaying the other statistics, sound that is substandard to the Amiga computer's expectations, the lack of a \"high score\" feature, and limited continues (as opposed to the arcade version which had unlimited continues). The reviewer said that \"the game hasn't been programmed to make use of any of the Amiga's features\" and that it \"is another in the sadly increasing number of games that has simply been ported over from the first conversion, so that none of the features that make Amiga games stand out are included\". Zzap!64 complained about the version's \"beepy\" sound and the very slow multi-load times, saying that the player may spend more time waiting for the game to load levels than play it. It also noted the lack of detail and variety in the graphics which did not make up for the slow multi-load times; the reviewer said that the enemies looked \"about as dangerous as a dead tortoise\". Other reviews from computer magazines gave the Amiga version of the game more positive reviews. Amiga User International praised the game's graphics, which they said were translated from the arcade version near-perfectly. It also appreciated the game's cartoon-style graphics, which said befits the game well. However, the review noticed that the game's code came from the Atari\u00a0ST version, which, as noted in the other reviews, resulted in choppy scrolling and a shrunken gameplay area: something which the Amiga could do \"perfectly smoothly with one hand tied behind its back\". The review also criticized its slow multi-load times and high retail price. German magazine Amiga Joker liked the game's \"candy-like graphics\" and gameplay style, which they said compared to the title The Great Giana Sisters. However, the reviewers criticized it for its choppy scrolling and sound, of which they said \"David Whittaker has already produced much better sound\".", "Category:Video games scored by David Whittaker"]}, {"page": "Minigame", "response": ["Some games, such as the WarioWare series (which are called microgames in the game), Universal Research Laboratories's Video Action, some Cinemaware titles like Defender of the Crown, David Whittaker's Lazy Jones or the smartphone satire Phone Story are made up of many minigames strung together into one video game.
