Created by Jed Mercurio, the series first broadcast on 23 June 2004, and is based on Mercurio's book of the same name. The series is centred on specialist registrar Rob Lake (Max Beesley), who starts in a new post in the Obstetrics and gynaecology department at the fictional South Central Infirmary, under the guidance of consultant obstetrician Roger Hurley (Patrick Baladi).", "* Patrick Baladi as Mr. Roger Hurley", "Lake (Max Beesley) realises that despite his friendly, professional demeanour and strong academics, his boss, Hurley (Patrick Baladi), is an incompetent surgeon who regularly bungles surgical procedures, to the detriment of his patients. Hurley is, however, protected by the principle \"Doctors look after doctors\", a phrase often repeated throughout the series. Initially, Lake is also protected by this principle, when his involvement in a death of a patient is covered up, although this death haunts him. Initially, Lake seeks to become a whistleblower, after seeing Hurley's gross incompetence and negligence, particularly after he badly mishandles a birth in which an abruption occurs, leaving the mother with substantial brain damage. The anaesthetist for the operation, Dr. Maria Orton (Susan Lynch), makes an official complaint against Hurley, but her colleagues close ranks around him. The pregnant Dr. Orton is ostracised, and the stress of the situation causes her to miscarry. She is eventually sectioned and admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Pressure from outside authorities, hospital politics and blackmail from Hurley eventually forces Lake into silence. Unable to oust him yet forced to work with him, Lake soon seeks a way out and finds a post at another hospital. But Hurley, despite agreeing that he should move on, changes his mind, ruins Lake's chance to escape by informing his new employers of Lake's mistakes and his real reasons for wanting to leave. At the end of the season, Hurley is shown to be in line for promotion as the hospital's clinical director. Lake, trapped in his job, comes clean to the relatives of the patient whose death he caused, so that, in his own words, he may be judged. The series ends on this cliffhanger."]}, {"page": "List of fictional doctors", "response": ["|Bodies || Dr. Maya DuttaDr. Polly GreyDr. Roger HurleyDr. Rob LakeDr. Maria OrtonDr. Tim SibleyDr. Tony Whitman || Preeya KalidasTamzin MallesonPatrick BaladiMax BeesleySusan LynchSimon LoweKeith Allen"]}, {"page": "Jilly Cooper", "response": ["*Patrick Baladi as Jeremy West"]}, {"page": "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason", "response": ["* Patrick Baladi as Flight attendant"]}, {"page": "A Taste of Honey", "response": ["* Peter - Patrick Baladi"]}, {"page": "Murder Is Easy", "response": ["A BBC Radio 4 adaptation in three parts by Joy Wilkinson and directed by Mary Peate, with Patrick Baladi as Luke Fitzwilliam, Lydia Leonard as Briget Conway, Michael Cochrane as Lord Whitfield, Marcia Warren as Honoria Waynflete, Marlene Sidaway as Miss Pinkerton and Patrick Brennan as Billy Bones/Rivers."]}, {"page": "The Office (British TV series)", "response": ["* Patrick Baladi as Neil Godwin:Brent's counterpart at the Swindon branch and eventually his immediate superior.
