The slogan \"Transylvania for the Transylvanians\" was taken up by Vaida-Voevod during his early activism with the party; it was also a form of nativism, directed specifically against Old-Kingdom bureaucrats sent into the region. The party's very creation had blocked the P\u021a's slow extension into Transylvania, which PNR leaders had found unpalatable.Nicolaescu, pp. 154\u2013155 Historian Thomas Gerard Gallagher proposes that Maniu valued political liberties more than \"national power\", which implied that he resented centralism.Thomas Gerard Gallagher, \"Mo\u0219tenirea Declara\u021biei de la Alba Iulia.

Although Salazar admired Mussolini and was influenced by his Labour Charter of 1927, he distanced himself from fascist dictatorship, which he considered a pagan Caesarist political system that recognised neither legal nor moral limits. Salazar also viewed German Nazism as espousing pagan elements that he considered repugnant. Just before World War II, Salazar made this declaration:  Scholars such as Stanley G.
