Curtis was attended by his friend Young Dutch Sam, a talented Jewish lightweight he had mentored in his early career.  Both Curtis and Perkins were believed by their backers to have been undefeated in former contests, and a crowd close to 5,000 assembled to view the contest. A purse of \u00a3100 was provided for each participant. Perkins was as much as two inches taller and roughly fourteen pounds heavier, according to London's Observer, but he was not as well known or judged to be as skilled as his opponent. Another critical factor in the match was that Perkins was five years younger, and seemed to have greater stamina in the closing rounds.Perkins was five years younger in \"Sparring at the Tennis Court\", The Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 4, 31 December 1828 The first seven rounds seemed to clearly favor Curtis, but the tide turned in the eighth, and in the eleventh and last round he received a blow on the temple.  Curtis had been sorely tested in the eighth through the eleventh rounds, and he could not return to scratch after the blow to his temple in the twelfth, and had his seconds end the bout in only 24 minutes.\"Dick Curtis and Perkins\", The Manchester Times, Manchester, England, pg. 8, 2 January 1829  The bout was well publicized in London area newspapers, and one of the most significant of Curtis's career.  Curtis's loss and the large purse he received led to a period of profligate or drunken days he shared with his aristocratic followers.  Drunken idleness weakened his body, and ended his boxing career when he lost the confidence of his sponsors.\"Sporting Intelligence\", The Observer, London, England, pg. 4, 5 January 1829.Did poorly in the eighth through last rounds in \"Dick Curtis and Perkins\", The Manchester Times, Manchester, England, pg. 8,  2 January 1829", "The carriage of Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford was seen at the match between Swift and Phelps, and the Marquess was known at times to both drink and gamble to excess, a habit which had had negative consequences for Young Dutch Sam, Owen Swift's second at the fight.  It is not unlikely the Marquess and other nobleman were occasionally in the company of Curtis when he turned to drinking after his loss to Jack Perkins, and after his incarceration after the death of William Phelps. Such behavior contributed to Curtis's poor health and early death five years later.The Carriage of 3rd Marquis of Waterford was at the fight in \"The Late Fatal Prizefight\", The Morning Chronicle, London, England, pg. 4, 20 March 1838"]}, {"page": "Abey Belasco", "response": ["Abraham Belasco, usually Aby or Abey, (1797 \u2013 1830) was an English bare-knuckle boxer who fought between 1817-24, and was considered one of the top rated Jewish  boxers of the post-Mendoza era, along with Isaac Bitton, Young Dutch Sam and Barney Aaron.  In his prime in 1817-18, Belasco may have been considered among the five highest rated London area boxers in any weight class."]}]}}
