Meg is a wealthy woman who, with the help of her late husband Charles' insurance money, and compensation money from the council for them building a motorway through their land, turned her large Georgian house into a motel. \"The Crossroads Motel\" was located on the outskirts of the small village of King's Oak, which is on the outskirts of Birmingham. With Charles, Meg had two children. The elder was a girl named Jill (Jane Rossington) (born 1946) followed by Alexander, or \"Sandy\" (Roger Tonge), in 1950. Kitty, on the other hand, is married to the unemployed Dick (Brian Kent) and is not wealthy. Dick and Kitty purchased a newsagents and tobacconists shop in the nearby town of Heathbury a few years after the show started. Kitty and Dick had a son called Brian (David Fennell), born in 1945. The idea of the sisters feuding was soon dropped.
