He formed a successful partnership with Dennis Uphill, scoring a club record 48 goals in 1959\u201360, which also saw the club promoted to the Third Division.

After beginning his career with the club in the reserve team, Brooks made his first team debut in a 2\u20130 defeat to Stoke City on 6 April 1953, but it would prove to be his only appearance of the 1952\u201353 season."]}, {"page": "Bobby Bell (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["Bell became a regular first team player at Watford, and along with Cliff Holton helped Watford gain promotion to the Third Division in 1959\u201360, for the first time in their history.

The arrival of player-manager Ken Furphy in 1964 signalled the end of Bell's Watford career; Furphy was also a full back, and selected himself in preference to Bell.
