In 1781, he became bookseller to George III, a position he held until 1820. In 1785, he published an improved edition of James Cook's third voyage. In 1786, he became involved with John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery and bore responsibility for the letterpress. He and the others in the project wanted to create a type that would be both utilitarian and beautiful.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Boydell", "response": ["The idea of a grand Shakespeare edition was conceived at a dinner at Josiah Boydell's home in November 1786. The guest list itself is evidence of Boydell's extensive connections in the artistic world: Benjamin West, painter to King George III; George Romney, a renowned painter; George Nicol, bookseller to the king and painter; William Hayley, a poet; John Hoole, a scholar and translator of Tasso and Aristotle; and Daniel Braithwaite, an engineer. Most sources also list the painter Paul Sandby. Although the initial idea for the edition was probably not Boydell's, he was the one to seize and pursue it.

Five important accounts of the occasion survive.\"Preface\", Collection of Prints by Josiah Boydell; \"Advertisement\" for the illustrated edition by George Nicol; court documents after the collapse of the venture by Josiah Boydell; Joseph Farington's diary entry; biography of George Romney written by his son. For an analysis of the relative reliability of these sources, see Friedman. From these, a guest list and a reconstruction of the conversation have been assembled.  The guest list reflects the range of Boydell's contacts in the artistic world: it included Benjamin West, painter to King George III; George Romney, a renowned portrait painter; George Nicol, bookseller to the king; William Hayley, a poet; John Hoole, a scholar and translator of Tasso and Aristotle; and Daniel Braithwaite, secretary to the postmaster general and a patron of artists such as Romney and Angelica Kauffman. Most accounts also place the painter Paul Sandby at the gathering.Santaniello, 7.", "In June 1788, Boydell and his nephew secured the lease on a site at 52 Pall Mall () to build the gallery and engaged George Dance, then the Clerk of the City Works, as the architect for the project.Sheppard, 325\u201338. Pall Mall at that time had a mix of expensive residences and commercial operations, such as bookshops and gentleman's clubs, popular with fashionable London society. The area also contained some less genteel establishments: King's Place (now Pall Mall Place), an alley running to the east and behind Boydell's gallery, was the site of Charlotte Hayes's high-class brothel.Sheppard, 323. Across King's Place, immediately to the east of Boydell's building, 51 Pall Mall had been purchased on 26 February 1787 by George Nicol, bookseller and future husband of Josiah's elder sister, Mary Boydell. As an indication of the changing character of the area, this property had been the home of Goostree's gentleman's club from 1773 to 1787. Begun as a gambling establishment for wealthy young men, it had later become a reformist political club that counted William Pitt and William Wilberforce as members."]}, {"page": "James Dodsley", "response": ["He led a secluded life, and some years before his death gave up his shop, dealing wholesale in his own publications.
