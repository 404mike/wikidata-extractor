Paul Doyle ascribed this to visiting teams' facing \"violent crowds, questionable refereeing and [...] [a]rriving just before kick-off after long road trips, often on hazardous surfaces\"."]}, {"page": "Claude Puel", "response": ["On 30 June 2016, Puel was appointed the manager of Southampton on a three-year deal. On 14 June 2017, Puel's contract was \"terminated with immediate effect\". His sacking yielded mixed reactions. In his only season in charge, Southampton reached the League Cup final and recorded an 8th-place finish in the Premier League, albeit with 17 fewer points than his predecessor Ronald Koeman attained the season prior. Puel was particularly criticised for his defensive tactics, with Southampton's scoring record one of the poorest in the league. Sports journalist Paul Doyle called Puel \"a victim of Southampton's admirably unreasonable expectations\"."]}, {"page": "Paul Doyle", "response": ["Paul Doyle may refer to:", "*Paul Doyle (politician) (born 1963), American politician in Connecticut", "*Paul Doyle (journalist), Irish sportswriter for the British newspaper The Guardian", "*Paul Doyle (baseball) (born 1939), Major League Baseball pitcher", "*Paul Doyle (footballer) (born 1984), East Stirlingshire defender", "*Paul Doyle (Gaelic footballer) (1899\u20131953), Irish Gaelic footballer"]}]}}
