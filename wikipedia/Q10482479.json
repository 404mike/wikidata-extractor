Inside forward Jack Lane was brought in from Cradley Heath in December 1920, followed by defender John Pearson from the same club two months later.

Centre forward Bert Freeman, who had become the first ever Burnley player to score 100\u00a0league goals, and held the club record for most goals in a season, played only four matches. His final appearance for Burnley came in the FA Cup Third Round defeat to Hull City. Several players made bit-part contributions to the campaign; Tom Brophy and Bob McGrory each made just three first-team appearances and Frank Birchenough, George Douglas, Jack Lane, Len Moorwood and Bill Taylor played in two matches or fewer. George Richardson and John Pearson, both new signings in the 1920\u201321 season, failed to make a first-team appearance for Burnley during the campaign.
