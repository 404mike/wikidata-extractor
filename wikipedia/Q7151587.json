It is conceded that the tighter composition is more dramatic, and the \"extended\" left side of the Prado type has been described as \"confusing\" in all versions, the \"pose and position\" of the new third hound at the rear \"complicated and difficulty to decipher\", and the whole \"clumsy as an arrangement\"."]}, {"page": "List of major paintings by Masaccio", "response": ["|09 || 150px|Saint Paul || 1426 \u2014 Saint Paul || (Pisa Altarpiece \u2013 Tempera on wood, 51\u00a0cm \u00d7 30\u00a0cm) \u2014 Saint Paul is the only portion of Masaccio's altarpiece that remains in Pisa, possibly positioned above the lost panel of Saint Peter. He is shown from the waist up, just like another Masaccio panel of similar make, the Saint Andrew below, now at the Getty Museum of Los Angeles. The saint is noticeably hirsute, with long hair and a beard (like a philosopher of old), and stands with firm gaze and looks far away; he is dressed in a red cloak modeled by large fields of colour ably illumined. Unlike the Saint Andrew, the artist's treatment of flesh and drapes has a more delicately nuanced approach, whereas the other work has more contrast and looks sculptural. Paul's fingers are solid and square and, according to the traditional iconography, he holds with his right hand a sword and with the left the Acts. Art historian Paul Joannides (1993) has connected this work with the statue of Jeremiah by Donatello.Cf. Paul Joannides, Masaccio and Masolino, Phaidon Press, 1993."]}]}}
