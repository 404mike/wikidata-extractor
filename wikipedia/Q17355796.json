He was educated at St Paul's School, but ran away from home and made his first appearance on the stage as Tressel in Richard III at the Old Orchard Street Theatre in Bath in 1791. There he was later seen as Romeo, and in other leading parts, both comic and tragic, and he repeated his successes in London from 1796. In the same year he married Elizabeth, the sister of Mary Ann Rundall, and they would in time have ten children.Elizabeth Lee, 'Rundall, Mary Ann (d. 1839)\u2019, rev.

Having decided on adopting music as his profession, he received a careful training, and became a sound theoretical musician, and an able performer on the organ and several other instruments. On his father presenting an organ to the parish church of Leamington, Elliston was elected organist, and held the post till his death. In the subsequent enlargement of the organ he exhibited considerable mechanical ingenuity, and invented a transposing piano on a new and simple plan. He was an early member of the choral society of Leamington, and whilst he was associated with it the society produced the Messiah and other great works during a three days' musical festival. Elliston himself built the music hall in Bath Street, with his brother William, who emigrated to Australia, he established the County Library. During the time that he and his brother were in partnership they gave concerts on an extensive scale. Subsequently, Elliston was lessee of the royal assembly rooms. Beyond some admired church services he composed little. In September 1863 he was appointed librarian of the free public library at Leamington. He died at Leamington on 19 April 1864, aged 63, and was buried in the cemetery."]}, {"page": "Rundall", "response": ["*Mary Ann Rundall (died 1839), British educational writer"]}]}}
