The venue was Victoria Ground, Stoke, then home of Stoke. Both teams were facing re-election and the match was a tight, nervy affair. Derby County and Bromage got off to a great start and within one minute of kicking off Lol Plackett had put Derby County ahead, 1\u20130. Derby were not playing well and never looked like scoring another in the first half and so led 1\u20130 at half-time. In the second-half the Derby attack were more lively but missed their chances so the Derby team were grateful to Enos Bromage who made some \"fine saves\" to keep Derby County in the lead. However, right at the end, Stoke winger, Jimmy Sayer scored an equaliser. The goal was disputed as Derby players felt the ball went in after the referee blew for time but the referee did not agree.", "Enos Bromage was retained for the 1889\u20131890 season and became the main goalkeeper for Derby County.
