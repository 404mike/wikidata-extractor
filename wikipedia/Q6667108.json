His work with Murray took the form of sketches aimed at alienating almost everyone, with the duo stamping on a blow-up doll of the recently deceased Linda McCartney, and tipping Murray, dressed as Superman, out of a wheelchair into the audience (a reference to the paralysis of Christopher Reeve). At one show, Sadowitz spat in the face of a drunken heckler who was constantly interrupting the show. His final act was to strip naked and run across the stage, prompting a mixture of disgust and hilarity from the audience. The Herald newspaper described the show as featuring \"Pyrotechnical swearing. Lavatorial straining noises. Wanton foodstuff-smearing. Simulated sodomy. Gratuitous adoption of Indian accents, plus spitting, shouting, and penile dismemberment\"."]}, {"page": "Logan murray", "response": ["#REDIRECT Logan Murray "]}, {"page": "Eirlys Bellin", "response": ["Bellin trained at the University of Edinburgh and the Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts.

The show was hosted by a computer animated fish called 'Vince Finn' (voiced by Logan Murray), who introduced each video in turn before it was played in a humorous manner, such as why Norman Cook is also known as 'Fatboy Slim' (although his real name is Quentin). In a separate introduction he defended Jennifer Lopez, saying her \"arse\" is not fat, and has muscle. He concludes this by asking the viewers, to \"Just ask that fat bird from Emmerdale!\". However, during the play of each video the lyrics would be shown at the bottom of the screen, while a bouncing-fish would move so the viewer if they chose to sing-along, would know what to sing and when. The graphics that produced the lyrics were made with the Windows application winOKE."]}, {"page": "Ayesha Hazarika", "response": ["While working as a press officer at the Department of Trade and Industry, Hazarika was persuaded by a friend to take a comedy course run by comedian Logan Murray.
