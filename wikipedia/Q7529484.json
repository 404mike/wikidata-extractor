C. Onions (later, Alldays and Onions Engineering Company). The couple moved into the eighteenth-century Culham Court on the Thames near Henley in the same year, which they rented.By his mid-thirties the couple retired but their connections with the city remained strong.\nHe donated the original marble statue to Queen Victoria in Victoria Square, Birmingham in 1897. Designed by Thomas Brock it was unveiled on 10 January 1901, twelve days before the death of the Queen.In the 1924 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours, Barber was created a baronet, of Culham Court in the County of Berkshire, for 'Political Services to Birmingham'.
