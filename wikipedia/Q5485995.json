Described as a stylish full back, he was a key member of the Aston Villa League defence in the inaugural season of 1888-89 which only conceded 43 goals, the third lowest. He played in the opening match on 8 September 1888 at Dudley Road, Wolverhampton, the then home of Wolverhampton Wanderers. The match finished 1\u20131. Coulton played at full-back. Coulton only missed three League games and one FA Cup tie over the season as Aston Villa finished as runners-up. As a full-back he played in a defence that achieved one League clean-sheet and kept the opposition to one-League-goal-in-a-match on no less than on nine occasions.", "link_mentions": {}}}
