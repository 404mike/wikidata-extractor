Hunter was close to David Trimble and, unenthusiastic about Jim Molyneaux's leadership of the party, he backed Trimble's successful candidacy in the September 1995 leadership election.  However, he rapidly became unhappy with Trimble's willingness to reconsider the party's views on the Irish republican movement.  He accompanied Trimble to a meeting with John Major in June 1996, at which Major announced that he intended to ask George J. Mitchell to chair talks relating to the Northern Ireland peace process.While Hunter occasionally attended the talks, which led to the Good Friday Agreement, he did not form part of the main talks team.  He was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum in South Antrim.  He opposed the Agreement, and although he was selected as a party candidate for the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election, he was not elected.Hunter was suggested as a possible UUP candidate in the 2000 South Antrim by-election, but the party instead stood David Burnside.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Hunter", "response": ["John Hunter may refer to:", "*John Hunter (British politician) (1724\u20131802), British Member of Parliament for Leominster", "*John Hunter (Canadian politician) (1909\u20131993), Canadian Liberal MP for Parkdale, 1949\u20131957", "*John Hunter (Consul-General) (died 1816), British Consul-General in Spain", "*John Hunter (Northern Ireland politician), Ulster unionist member of the Northern Ireland Forum", "*John Hunter (Royal Navy officer) (1737\u20131821), Governor of New South Wales", "*John Hunter (South Carolina politician) (c. 1750\u20131802), American politician", "*John Hunter (Westchester County, New York) (1778\u20131852), New York politician", "*John Hunter (Third Lanark footballer) (died 1891), Scottish football player", "*John Hunter (Australian footballer), Scottish-born Australian former footballer and coach", "* Ian Hunter (Scottish footballer) (born John Hunter, fl. 1960s), Scottish footballer (Falkirk)", "*John Hunter (Falkirk footballer) (fl. 1920s), Scottish footballer (Falkirk, Reading, Guildford)", "*John Hunter (footballer, born 1878) (1878\u20131966), known as 'Sailor', Scottish football player and manager (Motherwell)", "*John Hunter (American football), American football player", "*John Hunter (golfer) (1871\u20131946), Scottish professional golfer", "*John Hunter (rower) (born 1943), New Zealand rower", "*John Hunter (scientist) (born 1955), projectile researcher", "*John Hunter (screenwriter) (born 1911), American award-winning screenwriter", "*John Hunter (classicist) (1746\u20131837), joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh", "*John Hunter (surgeon) (1728\u20131793), surgeon and anatomist", "*John Hunter (physician) (1754\u20131809), physician", "*John Hunter (bishop) (1897\u20131965), former bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman", "*Jackie Hunter (John Hunter) (1903\u20131951), Canadian entertainer", "*John Hunter (performer), New Zealand female impersonator", "*John Hunter (singer), American singer and musician", "*John Hunter Nemechek (born 1997), American racing driver"]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|John Hunter", "|John Hunter"]}, {"page": "South Antrim (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| John Hunter(UUP)", "| style=\"text-align:right;\"|Peter KingJohn HunterIvan HunterPeter WalkerMervyn Rea"]}, {"page": "John Hunter (Irish politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hunter (Northern Ireland politician)"]}]}}
