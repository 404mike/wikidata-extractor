Some have achieved fame at bigger clubs after spending their early careers at the club. These include Peter Beardsley, Stan Bowles, Steve Harkness, Matt Jansen, Rory Delap, Danny Graham. Many older players spent their later years at Carlisle United after playing for bigger clubs. These include Michael Bridges, Mervyn Day, Kevin Gray and David McCreery. Former managers include Bill Shankly, Alan Ashman, Bob Stokoe, Harry Gregg, Mick Wadsworth, Nigel Pearson and Paul Simpson.

He has had his injury problems but we are happy he is over those and it's just a case now of building up his fitness levels.\" Another knee injury suffered in a pre-season friendly against Bolton Wanderers required more surgery and delayed Mellor's debut for Preston. Mellor finally got his first goal for Preston in the 3\u20131 victory over Southampton in March 2007. Out of favour under the Paul Simpson managerial era, Mellor had to prove himself over again to new P.N.E boss Alan Irvine. Under Irvine, Mellor finally got going and scored nine goals under him after Christmas 2007. Mellor again showed his panache for the 30-yard volley on 30 July 2008 by scoring in similar fashion for Preston North End in their friendly against Motherwell at Fir Park, which earned a 1\u20131 draw for Preston.

However, Paul Simpson's dismissal at Stockport County led to hopes of a return to the club for some County fans. Therefore, he was installed as the bookies favourite to become the next Port Vale manager, and also the bookie's favourite for the Stockport job. Gannon was confirmed as the manager of Port Vale on 6 January 2011, succeeding Micky Adams at the helm of the promotion chasing club, signing a contract that lasted until summer 2012. Saying that finishing outside of the top seven would be a failure, the Cheshire-based manager's first task after 'burying the hatchet' with Gareth Owen was to look for a new striker. Two weeks into his reign club captain Tommy Fraser left the club by mutual consent, as signs of what would be an unhappy relationship between club and manager quickly came to the surface. Gannon then brought in Romaine Sawyers and Kayleden Brown on loan from West Bromwich Albion, Jay O'Shea on loan from Birmingham City, Exodus Geohaghon on loan from Peterborough United, and striker Tom Pope on loan from Rotherham United."]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["Horton's next move was to become assistant to former Brighton teammate Mark Lawrenson, now rookie manager at Second Division Oxford United in May 1988. Lawrenson left the Manor Ground in October 1988 after star player Dean Saunders was sold to Derby County without his consent, and the board elected Horton as his replacement; at the time both Derby and Oxford were owned by members of Robert Maxwell's family. The million pound fee for Saunders allowed Horton to build a squad of his own: former Brighton teammate Steve Foster (Luton Town), Wales international Andy Melville (\u00a3270,000 from Swansea City), New Zealand international Ceri Evans (free agent), defensive midfielder Mickey Lewis (part-exchange to Derby for Trevor Hebberd), Jim Magilton (\u00a3100,000 from Liverpool), John Durnin (\u00a3250,000 from Liverpool), and England under-21 international winger Paul Simpson (\u00a3200,000 from Manchester City). He also gave d\u00e9buts to Joey Beauchamp and Paul Kee. Under his leadership Oxford finished the 1988\u201389 Second Division campaign in 17th-place. In preparation for the 1989\u201390 campaign, he exploited the relationship between Derby and Oxford to sign Dave Penney for \u00a3175,000. On the pitch it was a case of deja-vu, as Oxford finished the season in 17th-place, again with 54 points. Hoping to build a promotion winning squad for the 1990\u201391 campaign, he bought Doncaster Rovers defender Les Robinson for \u00a3150,000. The \"Yellows\" finished in tenth-place, eight points off the play-off places.", "The club faced a financial crisis following the mysterious death of Robert Maxwell, and over the summer Horton was forced to sell striker Martin Foyle to Port Vale for \u00a3375,000. He made no major signings in Foyle's place, and instead handed d\u00e9buts to Paul Wanless, Chris Allen, and Bobby Ford. He also sold Paul Simpson to Derby for \u00a3650,000 in February 1992. The loss of close to \u00a31 million of talent showed on the pitch, as Oxford ended the 1991\u201392 season one place and two points ahead of relegated Plymouth Argyle. They secured their safety with a final day win over Tranmere Rovers. At the end of the season he gave Steve McClaren his first job in management, putting him in charge of Oxford's youth-team. There was less drama in 1992\u201393, as his side finished in 14th-place, seven points above the relegation zone. Over the summer he paid Corby Town \u00a320,000 for striker Matt Murphy, and sold Andy Melville on to Sunderland for \u00a3500,000."]}]}}
