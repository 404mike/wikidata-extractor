Woolnough was hired by the Daily Star in 2001 after owner Richard Desmond authorised a \u00a3200,000 pay package.In December 2004, following Norwich City's 4\u20130 defeat at Chelsea, Woolnough produced a Monday morning column that enraged many Norwich fans, saying that City were \"gutless,\" that they would \"stink the place out\" with Premiership performances of a similar ilk, and that he \"Hopes they go down, and good riddance.\" Woolnough was strongly criticised for the article in Norwich, and although refusing to withdraw his comments, he later visited Carrow Road after receiving 450 e-mails and the local newspaper getting involved with the debate.From 2007, Woolnough was the presenter of Sky Sport's Sunday Supplement, replacing Jimmy Hill. Woolnough was previously the presenter of Hold the Back Page from 1994.\nWoolnough died on 18 September 2012, aged 63 from bowel cancer.Gary Lineker described Woolnough as \"one of football's finest journalists.\" The then Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said that Woolnough was \"a good journalist and a good personality.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Daily Star (United Kingdom)", "response": ["Other regular features in the Daily Star include Wired, a daily gossip column edited by James Cabooter, \"Hot TV\", a television news column edited by Ed Gleave and Peter Dyke, Mike Ward's weekly television review page and \"Forum\", a daily page devoted to readers' text messages, which are apparently printed verbatim. Opinion columns by Dominik Diamond and Vanessa Feltz were discontinued in 2008. Until he died in 2012, the chief football writer was Brian Woolnough, lured from The Sun in 2001 for a \u00a3200,000 pay packet."]}, {"page": "Jack Leslie (English footballer)", "response": ["Leslie was called up to the national team in 1925 as a non-travelling reserve; his manager, Bob Jack, told him he had been selected as a reserve for England against Ireland for an October 1925 Home Nations Championship game. However, the invitation to be a reserve for his country was withdrawn. It has been speculated that this was because of belated objections to his colour by members of the FA who had been unaware of his ethnicity. Later in life, Leslie told the journalist Brian Woolnough: \"They must have forgot I was a coloured boy.\""]}, {"page": "Sunday Supplement", "response": ["The presenter role was given to either Bill Bradshaw and Brian Woolnough. The format and setting remained consistent set over a breakfast/brunch table, but guest football journalists increased from two to three. Woolnough later took on the permanent presenter role, with regular guests including Patrick Barclay, Oliver Holt, Martin Samuel, Paul Smith and Henry Winter. Since Woolnough's death in September 2012, Neil Ashton went on to host the programme after having initially stood in during his predecessor's illness. On 12 January 2020, Ashton presented the show for the final time. Jacqui Oatley was announced as the new presenter of the show on 14 January 2020."]}, {"page": "Chris Kamara", "response": ["Kamara gave up on management after his time at Stoke City and instead worked as a pundit for a number of television and radio stations. He won a regular slot on Soccer Extra with Brian Woolnough in 1999, and from there was asked by Rob McCaffrey to contribute to Soccer Saturday on Sky Sports. There he was asked to attend a match on Saturday and appear over live video link providing brief updates on the match. At the time this was an untried concept in the UK, and Kamara and his camera crew largely learned how to best present the format as they went along. He quickly became well known on the programme for his highly excitable nature, propensity for comical gaffes and tendency to come out with unusual sayings that baffled host Jeff Stelling and the other studio pundits, such as his observation that the Tottenham players were \"fighting like beavers\" in their match against Arsenal. In one of his more famous on-air gaffes, he failed to realise that Anthony Vanden Borre had been sent off in the game he was watching between Portsmouth and Blackburn, instead thinking that he had been substituted."]}, {"page": "Julian Dicks", "response": ["Dicks made his debut for West Ham on 2 April 1988 in a Division One game against Sheffield Wednesday. West Ham lost the game 2\u20131. He would go on to make eight appearances in the 1987-88 season, his first season with West Ham. The following season, he became a regular player and first choice left back for The Hammers, starting the first game of the season, a 4\u20130 away defeat to Southampton and playing 34 of a possible 38 games that season. The season also saw his first goal for the club in a 2\u20131 defeat at Highbury to Arsenal. It was a poor season for West Ham who were relegated to Division Two having finished one place off the bottom of the league in 19th place with 38 points. Relegation had seen the sacking of manager John Lyall and the appointment of Scot, Lou Macari. The new manager and Dicks exhibited a poor working relationship from the outset. Despite this, and with West Ham now playing second-tier football, Dicks retained his left back position and became their regular penalty taker following the exit of former first choice taker, Ray Stewart. Dicks became well known for his penalties. During his West Ham career he scored 35, missing four. His first penalty success came on 23 September 1989 proving to be the only goal in a win against Watford. A future regular captain of the West Ham side, this season also saw his first captaincy, in a League Cup game on 19 September 1989 against his former club, Birmingham City, with manager Macari telling him \"I'm making you captain today and I'm making you penalty taker too\". Dicks was often cautioned and sent off by referees. His first red-card was in a match versus Wimbledon in the Football League Cup in the 1989\u201390 season. It was an infamous encounter which included an on-pitch brawl between the opposing players. The fighting was sparked by a two-footed tackle by Wimbledon player, Dennis Wise on Dicks. Six players were booked with the game being described as \"a disgrace to football\" by journalist, Brian Woolnough. West Ham finished 7th in a season which saw the departure of Lou Macari and the appointment of former player, Billy Bonds as manager. Dicks and Bonds both had reputations as \"hard men\" and quarrelled frequently."]}, {"page": "Peter Hill (journalist)", "response": ["Rising in status over the next two decades, he was appointed editor of the Daily Star in October 1998 by Lord Hollick, the former owner of Express newspapers, Hill increased the Star's circulation from 540,000 to 928,000, launched Daily Star Sunday, and became a What the Papers Say editor of the year award winner in January 2003.Jean Morgan \"'Some redtop editors have lost the plot': Hill\" , Press Gazette, 10 January 2003 Developing a positive professional relationship with Richard Desmond, after he had taken over Express Newspapers, led to a television advertising campaign, new sections, and the poaching of a football writer Brian Woolnough from The Sun whose salary at \u00a3200,000 was greater than Hills.David Lister \"Desmond gets his chequebook out for the lads\", The Independent, 16 January 2001"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Hill", "response": ["In 1999, Hill moved from the BBC to Sky Sports, where he featured on Jimmy Hill's Sunday Supplement, a weekly discussion show between Hill and three football journalists.
