Smith was one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1947. An all-rounder, Smith played for Essex from 1929 to 1951.Peter Smith was a leg-break and googly bowler and a lower order hitter of some style. He holds the Essex records both for the number of wickets in a season (172 in 1947), and for wickets in a career (1,610 between 1929 and 1951).\nSmith originally turned up at The Oval for the 1933 Test match against the West Indies, only to find that the telegram he had received was a hoax. It was another thirteen years before he was really selected for his country. He was noted for keeping to a good length, even when H. T. Bartlett smacked 28 off his six deliveries in the 1938 Gentlemen v. Players match at Lord's.He served in World War II, joining the British Army on 1 September 1939, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Essex Regiment in June 1940. Posted to the 2/4th Battalion, he served there for nearly three years before being sent to the Middle East in May 1943, becoming a staff officer at Combined Operations HQ at Alexandria.While playing for Essex against Derbyshire at Queen's Park, Chesterfield in 1947, he batted at number eleven, and came to the wicket with Essex 199 for 9 wickets. In two-and-a-half hours, Smith hit 163 runs, putting on 218 for the last wicket with Frank Vigar, who made an undefeated 114. Smith's 163 is the world record score for a number eleven batsman, and the partnership is one of only eleven of more than 200 runs for the last wicket in the whole of first-class cricket. In that season of 1947, Smith achieved the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets, and also established the record for most runs conceded in a season: 4667.Smith played only four Test matches for England: one in 1946 against India, two against Australia in the 1946\u201347 Ashes series and the last in New Zealand later on the tour. As a Test player, he was only modestly successful, but in taking 9/121 runs for the MCC against New South Wales he set the record for the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia.Peter Smith died in Hy\u00e8res, France, from a cerebral haemorrhage, after a fall on holiday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Laker", "response": ["While Laker had done enough at Saltaire to be well remembered there, his cricketing career really gathered pace and took off while he was with the RAOC in Egypt. Playing on coconut matting wickets in inter-service matches, he decided to develop the off spin technique he had been taught by Benny Wilson. He recalled that, \"to my utter amazement\", he could turn the ball \"quite prodigiously\" on the matting strips. John Arlott later wrote that English cricketers in Egypt were writing home and talking about \"a Yorkshire lad who could bowl off spin like a master\". In 1943, Laker went to Alexandria to play for the RAOC against an RAF team and took five wickets for ten runs including a hat-trick. In 1944, he played against a South African Air Force XI, scored a century and then took six wickets for ten runs. In these matches, he encountered several top-class players including Norman Yardley, Peter Smith, Bert Sutcliffe, Ron Aspinall, Dudley Nourse and Arthur McIntyre."]}, {"page": "Peter Smith", "response": ["Peter Smith may refer to:", "*Peter Smith (oboist), oboist with the Philadelphia Orchestra", "*Peter Smith (painter) (born 1967), contemporary British painter", "*Peter Smith, member of the British boyband Phixx", "*Peter Smith (Canadian politician) (1877\u20131934), Canadian politician involved in the Ontario Bond Scandal", "*Peter Smith (diplomat) (born 1942), Governor of the Cayman Islands, 1999\u20132002", "*Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh (1945\u20132021), leader of Wigan council and member of the House of Lords", "*Peter Smith (Australian cricketer) (born 1968), Australian cricketer", "*Peter Smith (English cricketer, born 1908) (1908\u20131967), English cricketer", "*Peter Smith (English cricketer, born 1934), English former cricketer", "*Peter Smith (English cricketer, born 1944), former English cricketer", "*Peter Smith (New Zealand cricketer) (1935\u20132013), New Zealand cricketer", "*Peter Smith (curler) (born 1964), Scottish curler", "*Peter Smith (Australian footballer, born 1960), Australian rules footballer at North Melbourne and Brisbane", "*Peter Smith (English footballer, born 1935), English footballer (Gillingham)", "*Peter Smith (English footballer, born 1969), English footballer (Brighton & Hove Albion)", "*Peter Smith (English footballer, born 1980), English footballer (Exeter City)", "*Peter Smith (English footballer, born 1985), English footballer (Hong Kong Football Club)", "*Peter Smith (Scottish footballer) (born 1937), Scottish footballer", "*Peter Smith (Welsh footballer) (born 1978), retired Welsh professional footballer", "*Peter Smith (ice hockey), current head coach of the Canadian national women's hockey team", "*Peter Smith (rugby league) (born 1955), rugby league international for Great Britain and England", "*Peter Smith (rugby union) (1924\u20131954), New Zealand rugby player", "*Peter Smith (biologist), professor at the University of Aberdeen", "*Peter Smith (epidemiologist) (born 1942), professor of tropical epidemiology", "*Peter Smith (mathematics and computing) - Emeritus professor at the University of Sunderland", "*Peter Smith (bishop) (1943\u20132020), Roman Catholic Archbishop of Southwark (formerly the Archbishop of Cardiff)", "*Peter Smith (businessman) (born 1946), English businessman, currently Chairman of estate agents Savills", "*Peter Smith (historian), British historian specializing in Bah\u00e1'\u00ed studies", "*Peter Smith (judge) (born 1952), judge of the High Court of England and Wales", "*Peter Smith (trade unionist) (1940\u20132006), general secretary of the British trade union, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers", "*Peter Smith (architectural historian) (1926\u20132013)"]}, {"page": "Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Smith (English cricketer, born 1908)"]}, {"page": "Lord Tennyson's XI cricket team in India in 1937\u201338", "response": ["*Peter Smith (26, Essex) "]}]}}
