He volunteered for the British Army upon graduation, and soon joined the Hampshires.  Part of the British Expeditionary Force, he was one of those evacuated on the last day at Dunkirk, escaping aboard a fishing trawler. At the end of 1940, he volunteered for the Airborne forces. Assigned to the British 1st Airborne Division, he landed near Nijmegen during Operation Market Garden and was one of the relatively few British airborne troops to escape death or capture during the operation. An excellent linguist, he remained in the Army for an extra year, acting as a German translator during the occupation.He was appointed as an area organiser of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers in 1946. In 1957, he became President of the Leicester City Labour Party.Whitlock was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham North in 1959. Throughout his career, he was a champion of improved conditions for office workers. A party whip from 1962, Whitlock was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in 1964, and retained the office until 1966. He was then briefly a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury before being appointed Comptroller of the Household. In 1967, he was again briefly a Commissioner of the Treasury before being appointed Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. At that office, he was responsible for African affairs, and he advocated the admission of Asians expelled from Uganda into Britain. At the merger of the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations in 1968, he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. Sent in 1969 to negotiate with the fledgling government of Anguilla, then seceding from Saint Kitts and Nevis, he was unceremoniously expelled from the country at gunpoint. The incident ended his ministerial career.In 1983, he unexpectedly lost his seat to the Conservative Party candidate Richard Ottaway as part of Labour's national landslide defeat that year. The margin of defeat of 362 votes (0.8%) was less than the 1,184 votes gained by the Communist candidate John Peck.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anguilla", "response": ["With negotiations failing to break the deadlock, a second referendum confirming Anguillans' desire for separation from St Kitts was held and the Republic of Anguilla was declared unilaterally, with Ronald Webster as president. Efforts by British envoy William Whitlock failed to break the impasse and 300 British troops were subsequently sent in March 1969. British authority was restored, and confirmed by the Anguilla Act of July 1971. In 1980, Anguilla was finally allowed to formally secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis and become a separate British Crown colony (now a British overseas territory). Since then, Anguilla has been politically stable, and has seen a large growth in its tourism and offshore financing sectors."]}, {"page": "History of Anguilla", "response": ["On 7 February 1969 Anguilla held a second referendum resulting in a vote of 1,739 to 4 against returning to association with Saint Kitts. At this point Anguilla declared itself an independent republic, with Webster again serving as Chairman.  A new British envoy, William Whitlock, arrived on 11 March 1969 with a proposal for a new interim British administration. He was quickly expelled. On 19 March, a contingent of 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, and 40 Metropolitan Police officers peacefully landed on the island, ostensibly to \"restore order\".  That autumn the troops left and Army engineers were brought in to improve the public works. Tony Lee returned as Commissioner and in 1971 worked out another \"interim agreement\" with the islanders. Effectively Anguilla was allowed to secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis, receiving its first constitution on 12 February 1976. It was not until 19 December 1980 that Anguilla was formally disassociated from Saint Kitts to become a separate British dependency. While Saint Kitts and Nevis went on to gain full independence from Britain in 1983, Anguilla still remains a British overseas territory."]}, {"page": "1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "Comptroller of the Household", "response": ["* 1966\u20131967: William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "response": ["|William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Whitlock"]}, {"page": "Vice-Chamberlain of the Household", "response": ["| William Whitlock || 1964 || 1966 ||  || "]}, {"page": "Itchen College", "response": ["* William Whitlock, politician"]}, {"page": "Labour government, 1964\u20131970", "response": ["|William Whitlock||11 April 1966 \u2013 7 July 1966 and 1 April 1967 \u2013 28 July 1967||\u00a0", "|William Whitlock||17 October 1968 \u2013 13 October 1969||\u00a0", "|William Whitlock||26 July 1967||Merged with Foreign Office 17 October 1968", "|William Whitlock||7 July 1966||\u00a0", "|rowspan=4|Vice-Chamberlain of the Household||William Whitlock||21 October 1964||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "William Whitlock", "response": ["William Whitlock may refer to:", "* William Whitlock Jr. (1791\u20131875), American businessman", "* William Whitlock (journalist) (1891\u20131977), New Zealand journalist, newspaper editor and proprietor", "* William Whitlock (politician) (1918\u20132001), British Labour Party MP for Nottingham North"]}, {"page": "Ronald Webster", "response": ["British Junior Minister William Whitlock from the United Kingdom arrived in March 1969 to establish another \"interim agreement\", and was expelled within hours of arrival.

Despite being greeted with British flags and chants of \"God Save the Queen\", Whitlock was curt and dismissive. His methods of diplomacy included a brief condescending speech, carelessly throwing leaflets at a gathered crowd, hardly acknowledging the local head of government, refusing the motorcade service arranged for him, and snubbing the plans he had made for lunch with local leader Ronald Webster.
