He was co-writer of the band's lyrics (alongside Richey Edwards) from 1989 to 1995, and has been the band's primary lyricist, following Edwards' disappearance since 1995. In addition to his work with Manic Street Preachers, Wire released a solo album, I Killed the Zeitgeist, in 2006.", "link_mentions": {}}}
