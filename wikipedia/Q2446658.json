In an interview with then-NME journalist Steve Lamacq, Edwards carved the phrase \"4REAL\" into his arm with a razor blade to prove their sincerity. He was taken to hospital and received seventeen stitches. NME subsequently ran a full-page story on the incident, including a phone interview with Richey on his motivations for doing it. A recording of the editorial meeting discussing whether or not they could publish the image was included as a b-side on the band's 1992 charity single Theme from M.A.S.H.

The song was credited with having \"rescued the band\" from the despair felt after the disappearance of Edwards, with Wire describing the song as \"a bolt of light from a severely dark place\".

It was just so utterly commercial and melodic.\" However, Nicky Wire contradicted this in 2011 while doing promotion for their greatest hits compilation National Treasures.

He said: \"Musically, the verse is downcast and melancholic and the chorus is an explosion of disillusionment and tears.\" The third single \"Dylan & Caitlin\" was released as a download on 9 March 2018. The fourth single \"Liverpool Revisited\" is about a magical day in the city, Nicky added that: \"It was on the Everything Must Go (anniversary) tour and I got up really early at sunrise to walk around Liverpool, polaroid camera in hand on a balmy day. It sounds clich\u00e9d I know, but Liverpool in the sun does take on a hypnotic quality, with the Mersey and the stone.\" The band also revealed that they were to support Guns N' Roses during their summer tour. The fifth and final single, \"Hold Me Like a Heaven\", was released as a download on 4 May 2018. Wire said that the song was inspired musically by David Bowie's Ashes to Ashes, something that the band wanted to write about, and Nicky thinks that this the closest that the band is going to get, sharing also that lyrics were informed by the work of Philip Larkin.", "In late 2005, both Bradfield and Wire announced that they intended to release solo material before a new album by the band.

The music was written \"in about ten minutes\" and Bradfield felt a sense of euphoria with the result. The song was credited with having \"rescued the band\" from the despair felt after the disappearance of Edwards, with Wire describing the song as \"a bolt of light from a severely dark place\". The band approached Mike Hedges to be involved in producing the song after hearing McAlmont & Butler's string-laden single \"Yes\", which Hedges had worked on.", "On 18 June 2009 the band were invited to officially open the new \u00a315m Cardiff Central Library, unveiling a plaque inscribed with the words to the opening line of the song. At the event, Wire spoke about how his experience with libraries had partly inspired the song.
