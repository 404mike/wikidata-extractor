The fact that these works are all from Northumbria might be held to reflect the particular strength of the church in that kingdom.Leslie Webster, Janet Backhouse, and Marion Archibald.

Works from the south were more restrained in their ornamentation than are those from Northumbria.", "By the early 11th century, these two traditions had fused and had spread to other centres. Although manuscripts dominate the corpus, sufficient architectural sculpture, ivory carving and metalwork survives to show that the same styles were current in secular art and became widespread in the south at parochial level. The wealth of England in the later tenth and eleventh century is clearly reflected in the lavish use of gold in manuscript art as well as for vessels, textiles and statues (now known only from descriptions). Widely admired, southern English art was highly influential in Normandy, France and Flanders from c. 1000.Janet Backhouse, Derek Howard Turner, and Leslie Webster, eds. The Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art, 966\u20131066. British Museum Publications Limited, 1984. Indeed, keen to possess it or recover its materials, the Normans appropriated it in large quantities in the wake of the Conquest. The Bayeux Tapestry, probably designed by a Canterbury artist for Bishop Odo of Bayeux, is arguably the apex of Anglo-Saxon art. Surveying nearly 600 years of continuous change, three common strands stand out: lavish colour and rich materials; an interplay between abstract ornament and representational subject matter; and a fusion of art styles reflecting English links to other parts of Europe.Grape, Wolfgang.

However, Janet Backhouse argues for the validity of the statement by pointing out that \"there is no reason to doubt [Aldred's] statement\" because he was \"recording a well-established tradition\". Eadfrith and Ethelwald were both bishops at the monastery of Lindisfarne where the manuscript was produced. As Alan Thacker notes, the Lindisfarne Gospels are \"undoubtedly the work of a single hand\", and Eadfrith remains regarded as \"the scribe and painter of the Lindisfarne Gospels\".Thacker 2004."]}, {"page": "Matthew Paris", "response": ["* Life of St Thomas of Canterbury, British Library, Loan MS 88 \u2013 Four leaves (the \"Becket Leaves\") survive from a French-verse history of the life of Thomas Becket with large illuminations.

Vaughan had previously noted that the leaves from the Life of St Thomas and the Life of King Edward are of different sizes, and written by different scribes, neither of them Paris himself, so they are not likely to be part of the manuscript that Paris wrote of having lent to the Countess of Arundel; but that, \"to judge from the script and the style of illumination\" they are \"very close copies of Matthew [Paris]'s original\".Vaughn (1958), Matthew Paris, p. 171"]}, {"page": "St Cuthbert Gospel", "response": ["It is thought likely that the book remained at Durham until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, although the various late medieval records of books and relics held there do not allow it to be identified with certainty.Brown (1969), 1\u20132, 5.

See also Brown (2003) and Janet Backhouse's 1981 book on the Lindisfarne Gospels for more details on the Durham records and the various other gospel books that might be referred to.  Durham Cathedral Priory closed in 1540, and some decades later the book was recorded by Archbishop Ussher in the library of the Oxford scholar, antiquary and astrologer Thomas Allen (1542\u20131632) of Gloucester Hall (now Worcester College, Oxford).  However it is not in a catalogue of Allen's library of 1622, and was not in the collection of Allen's manuscripts that was presented to the Bodleian Library by Sir Kenelm Digby in 1634.  Nothing is then known of its whereabouts for a century or so.Brown (1969), 1\u20132.  Intriguingly, Allen was an undergraduate at Trinity College, Oxford, which was on the former site of Durham College, Oxford, a cell of the Durham Cathedral Benedictines for their students.  Gloucester Hall had also been the main college for Benedictine monks at Oxford.

However Janet Backhouse, then Curator of Illuminated Manuscripts at the British Library, described the prefatory miniatures as \"England, possibly St Albans or Winchester\" in a book of 1997, and the BL website used a similar formula in late 2011, though assigning the tinted drawings to \"Westminster\".  Since the prefatory full-page miniatures are in a separate gathering their production may not necessarily have coincided exactly with that of the initials as regards either time or place, and they were \"almost certainly created independently before being bound into the book\".Morgan, 50; Royal, 118 (quoted); Backhouse, 69; BLC; Thomson, 61"]}]}}
