He retained his place until the end of the season, although he failed to live up to expectations with only three goals from twelve appearances. For the following season, the \"Saints\" signed Henry Hamilton and Penton only made one appearance, playing at inside-right in place of Archie Small on 16 September."]}, {"page": "Harry Brown (footballer, born 1883)", "response": ["By now, Brown had begun to slow but his \"clever touches ... served the club well\" for two further seasons, in both of which the Saints continued to struggle at the lower end of the table finishing a few places above the relegation zone. In 1911\u201312, Brown shared the inside-left duties with Archie Small, scoring seven goals from 29 league appearances, but in 1912\u201313 he only made six appearances and his final match came on 23 November 1912 (a 2\u20130 home victory over Plymouth Argyle), a week after the team had suffered their worst-ever defeat in a competitive match, losing 8\u20130 at Crystal Palace."]}, {"page": "Fred Turnbull (footballer, born 1888)", "response": ["In the summer of 1912, Coventry City's trainer, Jimmy McIntyre, moved to Southern League rivals, Southampton as trainer under secretary Ernest Arnfield. In October, with the \"Saints\" only winning one of their first eight matches, McIntyre returned to Coventry to sign Turnbull in an effort to improve the team's goal-scoring. Turnbull made his debut on 19 October, replacing Fred Taylor at home to Brighton & Hove Albion; although he scored on his debut, the match ended 5\u20132 in favour of Brighton. Despite scoring only one further league goal, Turnbull retained his place in the team for the remainder of the season, other than a spell out injured in January/February when he was replaced by Archie Small."]}, {"page": "Small (surname)", "response": ["* Archie Small (born 1889), English footballer with Southampton"]}]}}
