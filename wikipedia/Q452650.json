It starred Tim Healy, Kevin Whately, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, Christopher Fairbank, Pat Roach and Gary Holton, with Noel Clarke replacing Holton for series three and four and the two-part finale.

He is a Scouse plasterer with bad acne and originally a stutter, although he has clearly had it cured by the time of the third series. Despite his friendly exterior, Moxey has a dark side: he is a convicted - albeit reformed - arsonist and does try to explain that it is more of a mental illness and that he always tries to ensure that no-one is in the building to be burned (Series three). At the beginning of the second series, he absconds from an open prison, and is thereafter on the run under the aliases \"Brendan Mulcahy\" and \"Francis Fogarty\". During series three it emerges that he is now free from prison but that the local police need Moxey's help to gather information against Moxey's corrupt employer, Mickey Startup.

The Knight then stormed Arthur's investiture as Crown Prince and challenged those at court to single combat. Immune to all mortal weapons, De Bois killed two of Camelot's knights before being challenged by Arthur himself. Knowing that the spell would not end naturally until the wraith had killed Uther, Merlin had the Great Dragon burnish a sword with his fire to create a weapon that could kill the wraith, forging Excalibur. However, Uther had Arthur drugged and locked him in his chambers, before taking to the field using Excalibur.
