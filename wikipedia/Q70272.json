At this time, all the known comets had an orbital period of seventy years and more, with an aphelion far beyond the orbit of Uranus. The most famous comet of this family was Comet Halley with its period of seventy-six years. Therefore the orbit of the comet discovered by Pons was a sensation, because his orbit was found to have a period of 3.3 years, so that the aphelion had to be within the orbit of Jupiter. Encke predicted its return for 1822; this return was observable only from the southern hemisphere and was seen by Carl Ludwig Christian R\u00fcmker in Australia. The comet was also identified with the one seen by Pierre M\u00e9chain in 1786 and by Caroline Herschel in 1795."]}, {"page": "Thomas Brisbane", "response": ["Brisbane was a keen astronomer throughout his career. He had an observatory built at his ancestral home in 1808. From this observatory he was able to contribute to the advances in navigation which took place over the next hundred years. He took telescopes, books and two astronomical assistants, Carl Ludwig Christian R\u00fcmker and James Dunlop to New South Wales with him. On arrival he had the first properly-equipped Australian observatory built at Parramatta while waiting for his predecessor, Governor Macquarie to complete his final arrangements."]}, {"page": "Comet Encke", "response": ["As its official designation implies, Encke's Comet was the first periodic comet discovered after Halley's Comet (designated 1P/Halley). It was independently observed by several astronomers, the first two being Pierre M\u00e9chain and Charles Messier in 1786. It was next observed by Caroline Herschel in 1795 and was \"discovered\" for a third time by Jean-Louis Pons in 1818. Its orbit was calculated by Johann Franz Encke, who through laborious calculations was able to link observations of comets in 1786 (designated 2P/1786 B1), 1795 (2P/1795 V1), 1805 (2P/1805 U1) and 1818 (2P/1818 W1) to the same object. In 1819 he published his conclusions in the journal Correspondance astronomique, and predicted correctly its return in 1822 (2P/1822 L1). It was recovered by Carl Ludwig Christian R\u00fcmker at Parramatta Observatory on 2 June 1822."]}, {"page": "Johann Georg Repsold", "response": ["Repsold died in 1830 when he was struck by a falling beam while supervising firefighting at a major fire. The expense of running the observatory was subsequently taken over by the local government, and the new director was Carl Ludwig Christian R\u00fcmker.  Repsold's observatory was demolished upon the completion of a new observatory, the modern Hamburg Observatory at Bergedorf, between 1906 and 1912. The site is now occupied by the Hamburg Museum. A bronze bust was set up in his honour beside the Hamburg state astronomical observatory. His third son Adolf Repsold took over position in the Hamburg fire-brigade and having apprenticed with his father, he and his brother George began the instrument-making business of A. and G. Repsold. In 1831 they made an instrument for Wilhelm Bessel to use in Edinburgh. The family instrument business was continued by Adolf's son Johann Adolf Repsold (1838-1919)."]}, {"page": "Carl Ludwig Christian Rumker", "response": ["#redirect Carl Ludwig Christian R\u00fcmker"]}, {"page": "James Dunlop", "response": ["Soon after arriving, Brisbane almost immediately started building his observatory at Paramatta (original spelling), now named Parramatta, and it was Dunlop who was employed to do the astrometric observations for a new accurate southern star catalogue.

R\u00fcmker soon left the observatory in protest of his treatment during 1823, leaving Dunlop in charge of the astrometric measures and general maintenance of the astronomical instruments and the Observatory. Dunlop was not a professionally trained astronomer, so he importantly lacked the necessary mathematical skills to do astrometric reductions.
