Eden wrote the far left leaning lyrics of the band.Eden cited the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1979, and his dislike of her, as the key event in starting his interest in Marxism. Eden explained the approach to songwriting in McCarthy: \"Gary did the drums, although Tim and I used to give him suggestions. I put the lyrics on last. Some of the songs I wrote on my own, like \u2018Frans Hals\u2019\", also saying, \"almost all of the McCarthy songs are sung by a 'character', like a character in a play. I often don\u2019t agree with the sentiments expressed in the song, quite the reverse\".He later formed the short-lived Herzfeld, who released an EP and a 10-inch album on the Duophonic label. In 2005, he contributed vocals to two tracks, \"Where You Are\", and \"True Light\", to That Summer's Clear album.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "I Am a Wallet", "response": ["*Malcolm Eden \u2013 Voice and guitar"]}, {"page": "Barking Abbey School", "response": ["* Malcolm Eden, member of indie pop band McCarthy"]}, {"page": "McCarthy (band)", "response": ["McCarthy were a British indie pop band, formed in Barking, Greater London, England in 1984 by schoolmates Malcolm Eden (voice and guitar) and Tim Gane (lead guitar) with John Williamson (bass guitar) and Gary Baker (drums).

Gane was originally a drummer, but was initially taught to play guitar by Eden, who also taught Williamson to play bass. Eden and Gane were fans of punk groups such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Buzzcocks, and they covered their songs in small gigs as teenagers. Baker joined in 1984, and with the new line-up deciding on the name McCarthy (a reference to American politician Joe McCarthy), they released a self-financed first single, \"In Purgatory\" in 1985. The band were signed by the Pink Label, releasing two further singles \"Red Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Frans Hals\".
