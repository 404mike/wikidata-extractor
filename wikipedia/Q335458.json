The next year the UK Child Sex Abuse Report confirmed Carey had committed serious breaches of duty in wrongly discrediting credible allegations of child sex abuse within the Church and failing to accompany disciplinary action with adding to the church's own safeguarding watchlist. In February 2018 Carey was granted permission to officiate by Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford, allowing him to preach and preside at churches in the diocese. This was revoked on 17 June 2020 as the church found Carey could have done more to pass to police allegations of historic beatings at schools and evangelical children's camps, by John Smyth, a barrister given multiple recommendations by the church. Permission was restored to Carey by the Bishop of Oxford seven months later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Archbishop of Canterbury", "response": ["* 1991\u20132002: George Carey", "| George Carey"]}, {"page": "Filioque", "response": ["In 1994, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church (US) resolved that the Filioque should be deleted from the Nicene Creed in the next edition of the Prayer Book.
