The son of Ellis Edge, Thomas Edge was born in the parish of Blackburn in Lancashire in 1587/88. Edge\u00f8ya (Edge Island in Svalbard, an island which English whalers rediscovered in 1616) takes its name from him.

Their men were recruited for English (1611), Dutch (1613), northern French (1613), and Danish (1617) whaling expeditions to Spitsbergen, where they hunted the bowhead whale. The first was caught on 12 June 1611 (Old-Style) by one of the six Basque whalemen recruited from the town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz. When the merchants of San Sebastian learned of this new whaling ground they were eager to expand their operations to that distant corner of the Arctic. The next year, 1612, they dispatched a single ship under the command of Juan de Erauso and piloted by the Englishman Nicholas Woodcock, a former employee of the Muscovy Company of London who had made two prior voyages to Spitsbergen (1610\u201311). Upon reaching Spitsbergen they discovered such an abundance of whales \"that for a stretch of sixty leagues along the coast the sea was obscured.\"Senning, Calvin F.

On his return Woodcock spent sixteen months imprisoned in the Gatehouse and Tower for leading foreign vessels into an \"English preserve\". The expedition returned to Spain \"with [such] glowing reports of the wealth of the fishery\" that a patent was secured from the Viceroy of Navarre, Don Alonso de Idi\u00e1quez, conde de Aramayona. Its report led others to send out a fleet of whaleships to Spitsbergen in 1613, including the ports of Holland, northern France, and the Basque provinces. San Sebastian sent out a dozen ships (one of them being the ship Woodcock had piloted the previous year), while Saint-Jean-de-Luz sent out three or four.Conway, W. M. 1906.
