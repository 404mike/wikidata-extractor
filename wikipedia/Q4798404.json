As a captain he became commanding officer, successively, of the troopships HMS Jumna and HMS Malabar, which were tasked with ferrying troops between the United Kingdom and India. These were difficult commands with regular disputes between the military officers in charge of the troops and the naval officers in command of the ships.\nFanshawe went on to be second in command of the Channel Squadron, in which capacity he acted as umpire during the Naval Manoeuvres that took place in August 1900 and then became Commander-in-Chief Australia Station, in which role he was involved in concluding the naval agreement between the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Australia under which the Commonwealth Naval Forces evolved to become the Royal Australian Navy. After that he became President of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and then Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth.", "link_mentions": {}}}
