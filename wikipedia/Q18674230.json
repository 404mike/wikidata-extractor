He seems not to have enjoyed good relations with the highly skilled workforce, and many eminent artists left. Others however produced good work under his management, including Moses Webster, a flower painter who replaced Billingsley, Richard Dodson (who specialised in birds), George Robertson (land- and seascapes) and Cuthbert Lawton (hunting scenes). The best-known artist of this time was William Pegg, a Quaker, famed for his striking and idiosyncratic flower painting. He started in 1797 but his religious beliefs led him to the conclusion that painting was sinful and he left in 1800. He returned in 1813, but left again in 1820."]}, {"page": "William Duesbury (1763\u20131796)", "response": ["Duesbury was a son of William Duesbury (1725\u20131786) and the prosperity of the family pottery works (Royal Crown Derby) reached its highest point shortly after he succeeded to them.
