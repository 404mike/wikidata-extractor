He is best known for children's historical fiction. He won the 1956 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association for the year's best children's book by a British author, for Knight Crusader, the first in his so-called Carey Family series of novels. He was born in Aberavon, West Glamorgan. He was teaching at Bedford Modern School when the Second World War broke out. In 1940 he was commissioned lieutenant in the Welch Regiment, to which his pen name refers. He reached the rank of major and stayed in the Territorial Army after the war. He was for many years headmaster of Okehampton Grammar School in Devon.\nWelch's final work, The Road to Waterloo, not strictly speaking part of the Carey family saga but closely connected to it in terms of subject matter, remained unpublished at the time of his death. It was not until 2018 that it was discovered among his papers and published in a special edition by Smith Settle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*Ronald Welch (1909\u20131982) \u2013 The Gauntlet, Knight Crusader"]}, {"page": "Guy of Lusignan", "response": ["Guy has also appeared in various numbers of historical novels, notable examples from among them including in \"The Knights Templar Trilogy\" by the Swedish author Jan Guillou which depicts him as a scheming, incompetent and selfish as well as religiously fanatical villain accelerating the loss of the Holy Land to Sal\u0101\u1e25 ad-Din; in \"The Sir Balian d'Ibelin Trilogy\" by Helena P.

Yet the sixth and seventh examples also give the misleading impression that he was younger than King Richard: he was at least some years older than the latter. In the eighth example, Guy first meets Sibylla (her name spelled here as \"Sybilla\" like with the third example) after the latter leaves the scene of a verbal confrontation with her in-book-depicted-as-bitter-and-foul-tempered-and-verbal-lashing-and-verbal-and-emotional-outburst-prone mother Lady Agnes de Courtenay, with said verbal confrontation over whether or not Sibylla's younger half-sister Princess Isabella is a threat to her."]}, {"page": "1909 in literature", "response": ["*December 14 \u2013 Ronald Welch (Ronald Oliver Felton), Welsh novelist and children's writer writing in English"]}, {"page": "1982 in literature", "response": ["*February 5 \u2013 Ronald Welch (Ronald Oliver Felton) Welsh novelist and children's writer writing in English (born 1909)"]}, {"page": "1954 in literature", "response": ["*Ronald Welch \u2013 Knight Crusader", "*Carnegie Medal for children's literature: Ronald Welch, Knight Crusader"]}, {"page": "Battle of Hattin", "response": ["*The battle is prominently featured in the children's historical novel Knight Crusader by Ronald Welch"]}, {"page": "Genre fiction", "response": ["Ronald Welch's Carnegie Medal winning novel Knight Crusader is set in the 12th century and gives a depiction of the Third Crusade, featuring the Christian leader and King of England Richard the Lionheart."]}, {"page": "Conrad of Montferrat", "response": ["An entirely fictionalised, unambiguously wicked version of Conrad appears in Walter Scott's The Talisman, misspelled as 'Conrade of Montserrat' (the novelist apparently misreading 'f' as a long 's' in his sources) and described as a \"marmoset\" and \"popinjay\". He is also a villain in Maurice Hewlett's fanciful The Life and Death of Richard Yea-and-Nay (1900). He appears briefly, again in a negative light, in Ronald Welch's Knight Crusader (1954): the description owes much to his portrayal in Cecil B. de Mille's The Crusades, mentioned below. The nadir of his fictional appearances is in Graham Shelby's 1970 novel The Kings of Vain Intent. In this, he is thoroughly demonised\u2014depicted as a sinister figure, physically resembling a vampire; in a chapter added by the author to the U.S. edition, he beats and rapes Isabella. These works reflect the later Renaissance and Gothic novel cultural/ethnic stereotype of the 'Machiavellian' Italian: corrupt, scheming, dandified, not averse to poisoning, even (as in Shelby's novel) sexually sadistic. In contrast, the Russian-born French novelist Zo\u00e9 Oldenbourg gives him a more positive but fleeting cameo-role\u2014 proud, strong, and as handsome as Choniates described him\u2014in her 1946 novel Argile et Cendres (Clay and Ashes, published in English as The World Is Not Enough in 1948). He is the hero of Luigi Gabotto's 1968 novel Corrado di Monferrato, which covers his whole career.
