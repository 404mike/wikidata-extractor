He was a longtime friend and collaborator of 2005 Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter, having stimulated Pinter to write his first play, The Room (1957), in 1956. Woolf served as a faculty member at the University of Saskatchewan from 1983 to 1997 and as artistic director of Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan from 1991 until 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eric Idle", "response": ["On television, Idle created Rutland Weekend Television (RWT), a sketch show on BBC2, written by himself, with music by Neil Innes.

The name was a parody of London Weekend Television, the independent television franchise contractor that provided Londoners with their ITV services at weekends; Rutland had been England's smallest county, but had recently been 'abolished' in an administrative shake-up. To make the joke complete, the programme went out on a weekday. Other regular performers were David Battley, Henry Woolf, Gwen Taylor and Terence Bayler.

The friends he made in those days\u2014most particularly Henry Woolf, Michael (Mick) Goldstein and Morris (Moishe) Wernick\u2014have always been a vital part of the emotional texture of his life.\"Billington, Harold Pinter 11.  A major influence on Pinter was his inspirational English teacher Joseph Brearley, who directed him in school plays and with whom he took long walks, talking about literature.A collection of Pinter's correspondence with Brearley is held in the Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library.  Pinter's memorial epistolary poem \"Joseph Brearley 1909\u20131977 (Teacher of English)\", published in his collection Various Voices (177), ends with the following stanza: \"You're gone.  I'm at your side,/Walking with you from Clapton Pond to Finsbury Park,/And on, and on.\"  According to Billington, under Brearley's instruction, \"Pinter shone at English, wrote for the school magazine and discovered a gift for acting.\"Billington, Harold Pinter 10\u201311.See also \"Introduction by Harold Pinter, Nobel Laureate\", 7\u20139 in Watkins, ed.,  'Fortune's Fool': The Man Who Taught Harold Pinter: A Life of Joe Brearley.

After Pinter mentioned that he had an idea for a play, Woolf asked him to write it so that he could direct it to fulfill a requirement for his postgraduate work. Pinter wrote it in three days.Merritt, \"Talking about Pinter\" 147.

What begins as an investigation into the notorious 'Massed Flashers of Reigate' is quickly overtaken by the revelation that the police force are moonlighting as shop assistants and builders, and a commune for policemen (and women) is raided by hippies looking for drugs. The documentary also highlights how few people believe in Sir Keith Joseph, before Eric Idle is informed that he's getting a bad review. Idle rants about the uselessness of television critics for a while, but Henry Woolf informs him that his satirical invective has won him a rave review.
