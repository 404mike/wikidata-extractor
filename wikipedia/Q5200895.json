He was re-elected at the next 3 elections, and held the seat until the 1945 general election, which he did not contest.In 1938, Culverwell caused controversy by writing an article for  the Bristol Evening Post of 7 November 1938, which praised Nazi Germany. The next year, November 1939 Culverwell drew further criticism when he called for \"Peace by negotiation\" with Nazi Germany, arguing that the continuation of the war would strengthen the Soviet Union. Culverwell added that \"I can even visualise our troops fighting side by side with the Germans to defeat the Bolshevist menace.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
