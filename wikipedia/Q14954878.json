However, she finds allies in her investigation: Madeleine Rees, head of the Human Rights Commission, and internal-affairs specialist Peter Ward. As her investigation continues, Kathryn is met with threats on her answering machine and dead ends when highers-up override and close all the Internal Affairs cases. Still, she continues to try to find Raya, and finally locates her on a raid, but Raya refuses to come with her. A few days later, Raya is found dead, having been shot in the head by one of the traffickers, Ivan. Kathryn sends an email to fifty senior mission personnel detailing her findings; she is then fired from her job. She and Ward acquire evidence of an official admitting the scandal before she is forced to leave the country, and she brings it to the BBC News. The final credits note that after Kathryn's departure, a number of peacekeepers were sent home (although none faced criminal charges because of immunity laws), and the U.S. continues doing business with private contractors like Democra Security (including billion-dollar contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan).", "* Vanessa Redgrave as Madeleine Rees", "The Whistleblower was described as a \"fictionalized dramatic presentation\" of a late-1990s scandal. The producers based it on Bolkovac's experiences, rather than on her memoir. Vanessa Redgrave played Madeleine Rees, a UN human-rights official (\"one of the film's few heroic characters\") who helps Bolkovac uncover the sex trade. Raya (Roxana Condurache) and Luba (Paula Schramm), two Ukrainian young women who are trafficked into Bosnia, are the primary representations of the trafficking victims encountered by Bolkovac. Neither is based on a particular person; they are composites of young women forced to work in Bosnian brothels. Kondracki's younger sister, Rayisa, also played a trafficking victim. For legal reasons the pseudonym \"Democra Security\" was used for DynCorp International, the organization whose employees reportedly sexually enslaved the women.", "The actors' performances received overall praise from reviewers. Camerin Courtney of Christianity Today was dismayed that the main character engaged in a sexual relationship with a married man, but Weisz \"is wonderful as Bolkovac, a no-nonsense civil servant who is stunned at what she walks into\" while \"Vanessa Redgrave is a needed touch of strength and warmth as her mentor Madeleine, and David Strathairn is at his government thriller best as Peter Ward, an Internal Affairs agent. Raya is heart-breaking as the young victim.\" Steve Rea of The Post and Courier praised Redgrave's acting in the supporting role of Madeleine Rees as \"forceful, elegant, precise\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \"Weisz gives a psychologically astute performance as a woman who can't leave things alone.\" Rex Reed of The Observer called her \"superb\" in the lead role."]}, {"page": "Kathryn Bolkovac", "response": ["In July 2001, Bolkovac filed a lawsuit in Great Britain against DynCorp for unfair dismissal after a protected disclosure (whistleblowing). They had claimed she was fired for falsifying time sheets. On August 2, 2002 the tribunal unanimously ruled in her favour. She reported that fellow DynCorp officers were paying for prostitutes, raping underage girls and participating in sex trafficking. While locals were prosecuted, any UN contractors involved had immunity from prosecution in Bosnia, though, a number of these officers were forced to resign and leave the country, under suspicion of illegal activity. Madeleine Rees, Head of Office in the region for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, testified in her support. In November 2002, an employment tribunal ordered DynCorp to pay Bolkovac \u00a3110,221 in damages. She stated that the case settlement \u201cdidn\u2019t really even cover expenses\u201d.
