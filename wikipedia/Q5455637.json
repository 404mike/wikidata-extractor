He also took services at the penitentiary and the hospital. Archdeacon William Broughton limited his duties as rural dean to those of correspondence in order to prevent friction with the man he replaced as senior clergyman in the colony, William Bedford. Palmer, however, took Bedford's place on the Legislative Council, and Bedford resented the intrusion. He subsequently brought false rumours regarding Palmer's clerical conduct to Lieutenant Governor George Arthur. This made Arthur lose confidence in Bedford, but he appreciated Palmer's work. Palmer served on the Executive Council from 1834 to 1836. However, when Archdeacon William Hutchins arrived in Van Diemen's Land in 1837, Palmer ceased to be rural dean. He was appointed acting archdeacon from Hutchins' death in 1841 until 1843 when Archdeacon Fitzherbert Marriott and Bishop Francis Nixon arrived in the colony."]}]}}
