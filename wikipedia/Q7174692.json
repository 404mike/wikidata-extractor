He was a colleague of Brian Redhead and the two men were a regular presenting duo on the programme. Hobday was the presenter of The Money Programme on BBC Two television. He helped launch the late night current affairs programme Newsnight on BBC2, where he was both presenter and economic specialist. He was also involved in launching In Business on Radio 4.\nHis removal from the Today programme in 1996 was greeted with dismay from its listeners and allegations of ageism were levied at the BBC. Later he presented BBC Radio 4's World at One. Bilingual in French and English, and competent in Italian, he also contributed to French and French-Canadian television.\nHobday died on 18 January 2020.His brother John Hobday, who predeceased him, took the part of the first police constable in Ambridge in BBC Radio 4's The Archers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Today (BBC Radio 4)", "response": ["In the late 1970s and early 1980s, under editors Ken Goudie and Julian Holland, Today made moves to broaden its appeal away from broadcasting a lot of national politics with London-centric bias. Presentation was split for a time between London, usually by John Timpson, and from Manchester, usually by Brian Redhead. The objective was to make it more of a balanced, national programme. The on-air humour of the two presenters and the split of locations made the programme very popular and influential. Brian Redhead was quoted, \"If you want to drop a word in the ear of the nation, then this is the programme in which to do it.\"Today Programme . BBC Press Office. October 2007. This pairing lasted until Timpson's retirement in 1986. Other presenters during this period included Libby Purves in the late 1970s. John Humphrys and Sue MacGregor joined the rotating list of presenters in 1986. Peter Hobday, who had first broadcast on the programme in the 1950s, was a regular presenter from the early 1980s and a favourite with listeners because of his relaxed, urbane style.", "After Brian Redhead died in January 1994, James Naughtie became a member of the team. Peter Hobday presented the programme regularly until 1996; Sarah Montague replaced MacGregor in 2002. Carolyn Quinn was a regular presenter until 2008 as was Edward Stourton until 2009.

In 2010, he was criticised for his handling of the Industrial Society by a number of publications, including The Sunday Times and Private Eye, for having used the company for campaigning purposes rather than focusing on it as a business enterprise.

Redhead and Timpson had a series of running jokes on the programme, including the mythical organisations \"The Friends of the M6\" (long-suffering motorists trapped in its frequent traffic jams) and \"The League of Pear-Shaped Men\" (of which he and Timpson were the principal members). His sense of humour often appeared in asides in the Today programme. Talking of a convoy moving at 3\u00a0mph, Redhead observed that was probably 3\u00a0mph faster than they were moving on the M25 motorway that morning. When working the same slot as John Humphrys, he gleefully reported that Humphrys had turned up for work on his day off (probably before 6.00am) and was livid. On another occasion, he reported that the weather would be \"brighter in the north than the south, like the people\".
