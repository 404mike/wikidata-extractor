A year or two later, she went to India where she labored for twenty years. In 1880, she came to Japan and founded Brittan Girls\u2019 School, later known as Yokohama Eiwa Gakuin. At the age of sixty-three, she gave up regular mission work and for a number of years, conducted a boarding house.

The hotel attracted authors and intellectuals at least partly because The Golden Era, a weekly literary magazine, was headquartered there. Joaquin Miller described the magazine's offices as gaudily carpeted and gorgeously furnished. The British-born American missionary, Harriet G. Brittan, died at the hotel in 1897."]}, {"page": "Harriet Brittan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harriet G. Brittan"]}, {"page": "Harriet Gertrude Brittan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harriet G. Brittan"]}]}}
