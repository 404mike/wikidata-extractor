He signed a new three-year contract with Celtic in October. On 5 January 2014, Stokes passed another milestone when he scored his 100th competitive career goal, scoring Celtic's second goal in a 4\u20130 win away at St Mirren. Stokes, however, had a relatively poor season up that point. In 30 appearances for Celtic he had scored only seven goals. However, the arrival of Leigh Griffiths during the January transfer window saw an improvement in Stokes' form and goal ratio, with the pair forming an impressive partnership up front. Stokes was sent off against Motherwell on 18 January for a late tackle on Keith Lasley, but on his return from suspension scored seven goals in nine games, including a hat-trick against St Johnstone, to double his tally for the season. Stokes helped Celtic clinch the league title on 26 March, scoring twice in a 5\u20131 win away at Partick Thistle, the first of which was his 100th goal in Scottish football and the second of which was a superb volley from 12 yards into the top corner of the goal. Stokes scored another hat-trick on 27 April in a home league match against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, and also provided an assist for Leigh Griffiths in a 6\u20130 win.

Tom Hateley nearly made it two a few minutes later with a free-kick hitting the post. But it was only a short respite for Dunfermline as Motherwell scored again, Jamie Murphy strolled past Gary Mason and was given time to hit a 20-yard shot which heavily deflected off Alex Keddie and into the net. In the second half things hadn't changed with Motherwell dominating and when Chris Humphrey was allowed to cut inside into the box his shot clipped the post and into the net. Dunfermline then started to attack, pushing Motherwell back, and were rewarded when David Graham's 25-yard shot flicked off Joe Cardle and into the net, with Cardle claiming the goal. Cardle then bagged another as he cut into the box and his shot deflected off Stephen Craigan and past the helpless keeper.
