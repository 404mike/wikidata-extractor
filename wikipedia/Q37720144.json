The present Hafodunos Hall was designed in a Gothic revival style by Sir George Gilbert Scott, and built between 1861 and 1866 for Henry Robertson Sandbach, whose father, the slave-owner and merchant Samuel Sandbach, had bought the estate in 1830. Hafodunos is the only example of Scott's country house style in Wales and was the second domestic structure that was built by him, the first being Kelham Hall in Nottinghamshire. One of his sons, John Oldrid Scott, who was also an architect, was later employed in 1883 to design the elaborate conservatories."]}, {"page": "Peter McLagan", "response": ["McLagan was born in Demerara in British Guiana.

He had a business manufacturing white lead on Mill Lane, which later became a continuation of Great Howard Street. From 1827 until his death, he lived at a large house, variously described as being in St Anne Street and in Mansfield Street, that later became judge's lodgings. It had been constructed and briefly occupied by Samuel Sandbach, who was another mayor of Liverpool. Although not interested in politics, his oldest son, also called Thomas, married the daughter of Charles Horsfall, who was another Liverpool mayor."]}, {"page": "Sandbach, Tinne & Company", "response": ["The origins of Sandbach, Tinne & Company, together with its related firms, can be traced to James McInroy, a Scot from near Pitlochry who was trading in Grenada from 1782. Another of the original partners was Charles Stuart Parker, who arrived in Grenada to work as a clerk for his merchant uncle, George Robertson, in 1789. These men, too, were of Scots origin and within months of Parker's arrival arrangements were being made for them to form a trading partnership with a third Scotsman, a Mr Gordon. That partnership began operations in 1790 but soon hit difficulties as both uncle and nephew became upset with Gordon's behaviour. Gordon ceased to be a partner and McInroy joined them while continuing also independently to operate a business in the Dutch colony of Demerara. In 1792, the partnership was expanded to include Samuel Sandbach, an Englishman who had arrived in Grenada in 1788 to work for his uncle, who shared the same name and was also an established merchant there. Sandbach had gravitated to being a clerk for the McInroy, Parker and Robertson partnership and had impressed them so much that they invited him to join their firm on an equal standing."]}, {"page": "Margaret Sandbach", "response": ["Margaret married Henry Robertson Sandbach on 4 May 1832.

He became associated with the Scottish-dominated, Liverpool-based company Sandbach, Tinne & Company. This company had been founded in 1790 when his uncle George Robertson, who had been trading in Grenada and his future brother-in-law Charles Parker joined with Samuel Sandbach and the Demerara merchant James McInroy (1759\u20131825) to create what was originally known as McInroy, Sandbach & Company. This business had been described as the \"Rothschilds of Demerara\" in the 1820s. It would become one of the most successful trading companies in the Caribbean, dealing with sugar plantations in the Caribbean which were worked by African slaves. These families created strong connections to each other through marriage. By the time that George Rainy joined the company as a partner in Liverpool it had become Sandbach, Tinne & Company.
