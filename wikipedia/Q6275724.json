It was written by Toby Whithouse, who previously wrote \"School Reunion\", and was directed by first-time Doctor Who director Jonny Campbell.", "The opening scene, which detailed Isabella's entrance to the school and the foreboding danger that came with it, was described as \"classic\" Doctor Who by Whithouse as it contained a \"victim coming into a trap\". Isabella's scream at the end of the scene originally went into the title sequence; however, director Jonny Campbell thought that the next two scenes had \"soft endings\" that would not work well right after each other. As a result, the title sequence was moved to after the scene of the Doctor crashing Rory's stag party, which Whithouse described as a \"fun scene\" and a unique opening to the titles. Whithouse also wanted to emphasise the amount of danger the Doctor puts people in, which is pointed out by Rory in the episode. He believed that the companions over time developed the same mentality as the Doctor in running towards the danger, and so Rory was a great opportunity to question that. Whithouse also wanted a \"comic thread\" to \"dilute\" the plot and character developments. He also noted that it was difficult to capture Guido's \"tragic\" character in the running time. The episode also gives a \"metatexual\" reference by showing a picture of the Doctor's first incarnation on his library card. The references to \"silence\" in the episode are shown as flashbacks in the episode \"Day of the Moon\" of the next series, suggesting it was foreshadowing to the enemy of the Silence which were the focus of that episode."]}, {"page": "Vincent and the Doctor", "response": ["\"Vincent and the Doctor\" is the tenth episode of the fifth series of British science fiction television series Doctor Who, first broadcast on BBC One on 5 June 2010.

Executive producer Piers Wenger and director Jonny Campbell also critiqued the script. Moffat told Curtis that it needed to \"start quicker\" and that the meeting with the Doctor and Vincent was \"dull\" and needed to be something \"cute\" like Curtis had done in his films. He also noted that the Doctor did not talk as much as Curtis had written and recommended Curtis watch some episodes to see he was \"rather efficient in the way that he talked\". Curtis enjoyed the experience, commenting that it was \"fun\" to work within boundaries rather than doing it all himself. After seeing a read-through performed by leads Matt Smith and Karen Gillan, Curtis made more changes. He commented that it was easy to write for them as they were \"so delightful and modern and relaxed\". Curtis's original title for the episode was \"Eyes That See the Darkness\", but he said this was vetoed."]}, {"page": "Spooks (series 3)", "response": ["There were five directors, each directing two episodes; Jonny Campbell, Cilla Ware, Justin Chadwick, Bill Anderson, and Alrick Riley. Featherstone wanted Campbell to direct for Spooks after they worked together producing the television series Glasgow Kiss. He was drawn to directing the first two episodes because of Brenton's writing and the fact he would give Tom a send off. Faith Penhale was the series script executive. Simon Chaudoir, Jake Polonsky, Kieran McGuigan, Sue Gibson and Baz Irvine were the directors of photography. Barney Pilling and Paul Knight were the series editors. Stevie Herbert and Robert Foster were production designers. Jennie Muskett and Sheridan Tongue composed the original music. David Myers was the make-up designer, whilst Iain Macauley was the costume designer. Mark Doman designed the on-screen computer graphics, films surveillance shots and television footage from the series' point of view. On occasion, crew members appeared as extras. For instance, pictures of every crew member were used as students and faculty for a university database in \"The Sleeper\". In \"Love and Death\", the crew members present on the ferry appeared as extras in a bar scene. Collins also voiced a florist on a telephone message at the end of the same episode.", "Director Jonny Campbell helped search for several \"interesting locations\" for the first block to draw the audience with interesting visuals. This included a church in Smithfield and the Natural History Museum; in the latter's case, Campbell believed the location was \"harking back\" to traditional spy films. Filming there was expensive and management of the museum only allowed the crew to film for a few hours. The club Mace frequents was filmed at the Royal Automobile Club in Pall Mall. \"The Sleeper\" included scenes filmed at the University College London; a lecture room in the college was where the third series started filming. The explosion scene at the beginning of the episode was filmed at a council estate in Peckham. The estate was condemned for demolition, which proved to be a suitable location for a big explosion. The crew returned there again a month later to gather footage of the demolition work. Several exterior shots where Harry meets with government officials and his officers were filmed on walkways outside the Houses of Parliament. The upper-class home of Riff and B in \"Celebrity\" was filmed in a house in Kensington that was for sale for approximately \u00a327\u00a0million at the time. Filming in public locations often took place on weekends, when they were closed off to the public. However, there were exceptions. Some scenes in \"The Suffering of Strangers\" were filmed outside the National Film Theatre in South Bank, a popular tourist destination. Shooting there became difficult as the crew had no control over the tourists. Other known London landmarks that were filmed at included Lord's Cricket Ground, St Martin-in-the-Fields, Tate Modern, the Old Bailey criminal court, Waterloo station, Empress State Building, and 30 St Mary Axe (the Gherkin)."]}, {"page": "List of awards and nominations received by Doctor Who", "response": ["|Richard Curtis and Jonny Campbell", "|  class=\"nowrap\"|Richard Curtis and Jonny Campbell", "| Jonny Campbell and Richard Curtis"]}, {"page": "The Casual Vacancy (miniseries)", "response": ["The Casual Vacancy is a 2015 British miniseries based on the 2012 novel of the same title by J.
