The phrase is also used in an ironic fashion, when the person demanding the action simultaneously demands that the subject of the command speak, as in \"shut up and answer the question\". The usage of this phrase for comedic effect traces at least as far back as the 1870s, where the title character of a short farce titled \"Piperman's Predicaments\" is commanded to \"Shut up; and answer plainly\".\"Piperman's Predicaments: A Farce, in One Act\", (translated by James Redding Ware), reported in  The British Drama, Volume 5 (1871), p. 192.
