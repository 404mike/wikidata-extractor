His research was chiefly on the constitution of alloys and opium alkaloids. He contributed to both physics and chemistry. (Please see references below.) For his work on metals and alloys, he was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1869.\nMatthiessen committed suicide in 1870 under \"severe nervous strain\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
