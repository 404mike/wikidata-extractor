Art historian H. W. Janson repeated it \"On a visit to North Africa, he had seen a horse killed by a lion; this experience haunted his imagination, and from it he developed a new type of animal picture full of Romantic feeling for the grandeur and violence of nature.\" However, research published in 1965 produced a rather persuasive argument that Stubbs in fact never traveled to Africa, and the actual inspiration for the painting was an antique sculpture he had seen in a well documented 1754 stay in Rome. The sculpture, Lion Seizing a Horse, in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome, is a restored Roman copy of a Hellenistic original. It has been a celebrated work since the Renaissance, admired by Michelangelo, included in guidebooks of Stubbs's day, and copied any number of times by various artist in marble, bronze, and prints, including an 18th century marble copy in the collection of Stubbs's patron Henry Blundell, who also acquired one of the paintings by Stubbs."]}, {"page": "1810 in art", "response": ["*August 28 \u2013 Henry Blundell, art collector (born 1724)"]}, {"page": "Ince Blundell", "response": ["Ince Blundell Hall was noted for the collection of marble statues from Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, as well as 17th and 18th-century Italian sculptures by artists such as Carlo Albacini and Bartolomeo Cavaceppi.

In order to house them at Ince Blundell, he constructed a series of buildings in the grounds of the hall.  Initially he kept his collection in a series of greenhouses, but in about 1790\u201392 he built the Garden Temple, a building in Classical style.  This was followed in about 1802\u201305 by a more impressive building, the Pantheon, its design based on the Pantheon in Rome.  When Henry died in 1810, the hall passed to his son, Charles.  He died childless in 1837, and the estate passed to Thomas Weld, a cousin.  He took the name of Thomas Weld Blundell, and restored, refurnished and redecorated the hall.  In the mid-19th\u00a0century a large bay window was added to the west side of the Drawing Room, and a new Dining Room was built at the east end.  Ceilings were raised, and interior decoration was carried out by the firm of Crace.  Weld Blundell added a new vestibule to connect the Gallery, the Dining Room, and the Pantheon.  The portico of the Pantheon became the new main entrance to the hall, and the Pantheon itself the reception hall.  What had been the original chapel became the organ loft of a new large two-storey chapel designed by J.\u00a0J.\u00a0Scoles.", "During the Second World War the hall, its buildings and park were used by the War Office and the Admiralty, and additional buildings were erected.  Five parachute bombs fell near the hall, one of them blowing out all the windows in the garden front.  By 1960 the estate was \"seriously dilapidated\", and it was decided to sell the hall and the surrounding land. The farms went to the sitting tenants, and the chapel, which had been used as a parish church since 1947, was given to the Archdiocese of Liverpool. The hall was bought by the Canonesses of St. Augustine of the Mercy of Jesus, who adapted it for use as a nursing home. It was officially opened as such on 27\u00a0May 1961 by the Rt Revd John Heenan, who was at that time the Archbishop of Liverpool.  Much work had to be done to make the building fit for its new purpose, including making it weather-proof, installing central heating, a lift, and a washbasin in each bedroom.  A new entrance was created at the back of the hall, with access for wheelchairs.  The former Gallery was converted into a chapel for the use of staff and residents.

It was designed by Henry Blundell in the 1770s, its Baroque style design copied from a gateway in the background of one of his paintings, the Marriage of Bacchus and Ariadne by Sebastiano Ricci. The gate is constructed in sandstone and consists of a central round-arched entrance and two flat-headed pedestrian entrances.  The central entrance is in Doric style with columns, and an entablature with a triglyph frieze including bucrania and rosettes.  On the top is a broken pediment containing a cartouche and an urn decorated with ram's heads and festoons.  The pedestrian entrances have rusticated surrounds.  Above one is a statue of a lion, and above the other is a lioness.  The entrances contain cast iron gates.  The East Gate dates from the 1770s, and was probably also designed by Henry Blundell.
