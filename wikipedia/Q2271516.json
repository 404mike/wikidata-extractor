When Guevara also fails to give any answer at all Idle throws the question open to the other guests, but still receives no answer from any of then. Idle then says: \"Well, I'm not surprised you didn't get that. It was in fact a trick question: Coventry City have never won the FA Cup.\" With the scores all equal the second quiz round begins. Idle asks Lenin the name of the song by Teddy Johnson and Pearl Carr which won the Eurovision Song Contest 1959. Lenin has no clue, so Idle once again throws the question open.
