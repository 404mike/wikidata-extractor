He scored over 70 films in a career lasting over fifty years. His most famous works included Where Eagles Dare, Battle of Britain, 633 Squadron, Margaret Rutherford's Miss Marple films, and Frenzy.\nBorn in Plymouth, Devon, England, Goodwin learned to play the piano and trumpet from the age of five which allowed him to join the school band. When he was nine, the family moved to Harrow, London, where he attended Willesden County School and Pinner County Grammar School, in Middlesex. From there he went on to study the trumpet in London at the Guildhall School of Music.Whilst working as a copyist, he formed his own orchestra in his spare time and began arranging and conducting recordings for over fifty artists, which resulted in more than 100 chart successes. He wrote his first feature film score for Whirlpool, with screenplay by Lawrence P. Bachmann. After Bachmann became executive producer at MGM-British Studios in 1959, Goodwin composed and conducted the music for most of its productions, as well as working for other film studios.\nIn the 1980s Goodwin began concentrating on live orchestral performances and appeared as guest conductor with many symphony orchestras at home and abroad including the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Miss Marple", "response": ["The music to all four films was composed and conducted by Ron Goodwin.

The music department at United Artists furthermore objected that the score was too short to fill an LP recording which was intended to be marketed with the film.Kennedy 1989, pp. 238\u2013239. As a result, John Barry \u2013 who had scored several James Bond films \u2013 was approached, but he declined.Kennedy 1989, p. 239.

The Walton score for the battle sequence was played with no sound effects of aircraft engines or gunfire, giving the segment a transcendent, lyrical quality.", "Ron Goodwin's score opens with the \"Luftwaffe March\", later retitled \"Aces High\", in the style of a traditional German military march in 6/8 time.  The march places heavy emphasis on the \"oom-pah\" sound of tubas and lower-pitched horns on the first and second beats and has the glockenspiel double the horns in the melody. Because of the great length of this sequence, which shows a Luftwaffe general's inspection of a Heinkel squadron in occupied France, the \"Aces High\" has three separate bridges between choruses of the main theme, one of which recurs several times in a gently sentimental variation. Despite its origin in a representation of a tyrannical threat to democracy, the march has become a popular British march tune, like the Dambusters March; an adaptation was first played by a British military band in 1974 by the Corps of Drums of the Royal Pioneer Corps and is now(R.P.C. Corps of Drums) frequently played at military parades and by marching bands in Northern Ireland. American radio personality and convicted Watergate conspirator G.
