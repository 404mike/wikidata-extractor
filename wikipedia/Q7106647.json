During his playing days he played both in midfielder and in attack. During his career he took part in two successful Fourth Division promotion campaigns.\nHe started his career as a youth team player at Middlesbrough, before joining Manchester United in 1976. Failing to make the first team, he joined non-league Billingham Synthonia and then Gateshead, before returning to the professional game with Southampton in 1978. A year later he signed for Stockport County, where his career really took off. Five years he spent with Stockport, making close to 200 league appearances. He then spent two years at Port Vale and then Preston North End. In 1989, he left the professional game permanently, joining non-league Lancaster City. He signed with Winsford United in 1993 and then Hyde United a year later. He retired as a player in 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andy McAteer", "response": ["Upon leaving the full-time game, McAteer first signed, along with Oshor Williams, for Northern Premier League club Lancaster City, but new work commitments meant that he played only one game for the club."]}, {"page": "History of Preston North End F.C.", "response": ["The plan seemed to work, as North End, under new manager John McGrath, stormed to promotion in 1986\u201387 after finishing second in Division Four behind Northampton Town. The team's home form was superb as the opposition appeared to find it difficult to adapt to the new pitch, and McGrath's new recruits, journeymen such as Sam Allardyce, Oshor Williams, Gary Swann, Ronnie Hildersley and Les Chapman made them an extremely hard team to beat."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Williams", "response": ["*Oshor Williams (born 1958), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Jon Bowden", "response": ["He joined Port Vale for \u00a35,000 in September 1985. He impressed greatly on his debut at number 10 in a 4\u20131 win at Vale Park on 14 September against Cambridge United, and was described as the 'architect of victory'; despite this great start he dislocated his elbow three minutes before the full-time whistle. After recovering he became a first team regular in the 1985\u201386 Fourth Division promotion side, scoring three goals in 44 games, playing in a five-man midfield with Oshor Williams, Geoff Hunter, Robbie Earle, and Paul Maguire. Bowden remained a regular in John Rudge's first team plans in the Third Division, scoring four goals in 42 matches in 1986\u201387.

Tommy Gore soon announced his retirement due to a neck injury. The Vale then went five games unbeaten, as the club announced a new five year shirt sponsorship deal with Trentham firm Eagle Delivery Service. Young winger Ray Walker also arrived on loan from Aston Villa. The fans chanted 'what a load of rubbish' on 1 October, as Vale lost 3\u20130 at home to struggling side Northampton Town. Rudge stated that 'In truth we were rubbish' and promptly cancelled the player's day off. Another five game unbeaten run followed, as Brown showed his 'class' and Walker impressed. On 5 November, Eamonn O'Keefe scored a 'brilliant' hat-trick past Southend United in a 4\u20131 win. Rudge then signed Stockport County's outside-right Oshor Williams for \u00a37,000. Vale's form then suffered after Walker returned to Villa Park. To remedy this Rudge signed Southend United midfielder Billy Kellock, who made 'a stunning impact' in his debut, playing a key part in the 5\u20131 victory over Exeter City on New Year's Day.
