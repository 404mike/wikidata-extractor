A granddaughter of the 24th Earl of Crawford, she married Henry Manners in 1882. She was styled the Marchioness of Granby from 1888 to 1906, when Manners succeeded as Duke of Rutland. She had five children, including the 9th Duke of Rutland and the socialite Lady Diana Cooper.\nThough she had no formal training as an artist, the Duchess painted portraits of her social circle. Many of her works were displayed at various major art exhibits in the UK, including the Grosvenor Gallery, the Royal Academy of Arts, and the New Gallery. Violet was also a prominent member of The Souls, an aristocratic social circle that favoured intellectual pursuits and avant-garde artistic tastes. Known for her beauty, she was the subject of many paintings. Watts Gallery Trust acquired a beautiful Watts portrait of her in Dec 2016 (Art Fund, the ACE/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, and donors). Inspired by the acquisition, John Julius Norwich (a prominent historian and Violet's grandson) donated over 40 of Violet's own drawings, including a self-portrait and a portrait of Harry Cust. She became engaged in sculpting after the death of her elder son Robert in 1894.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Souls", "response": ["*Mary Constance Charteris, Lady Elcho (1883\u20131914), eldest daughter of Percy and Madeline Wyndham. She married Hugo Charteris, Lord Elcho, in 1883. They had seven children. One son died very young. Their eldest son, Captain Hugo Francis Charteris, Lord Elcho, married Lady Violet Catherine Manners, the daughter of Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland (see below) and Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland, in 1911. He and his brother Yvo Alan Charteris, were killed in action during the Great War. Their eldest daughter, Lady Cynthia Mary Evelyn Charteris, a prolific writer, married poet Herbert Asquith, second son of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. Their youngest child, Lady Irene Corona Charteris, married Ivor Windsor-Clive, 2nd Earl of Plymouth, son of Albert and Roberta Windsor-Clive, also members of The Souls.", "* Henry \"Harry\" Cust (1861\u20131917) served as a Member of Parliament for the Unionist Party, as Justice of the Peace for Bedfordshire, as Deputy Lieutenant of Bedfordshire, and as Justice of the Peace for Lincolnshire.  He had a reputation as a brilliant conversationalist and a philanderer. Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland, was his mistress, and her daughter, Lady Diana Cooper, n\u00e9e Manners, was his child. In 1892, William Waldorf Astor invited Cust to edit the Pall Mall Gazette. He made it the best evening journal of the period, in part by enlisting such contributors as Rudyard Kipling and H. G. Wells. Cust rejected Astor's own submissions and disagreed with his politics: Astor dismissed him in February 1896. Among Cust's own works is the poem  \"Non nobis \".  During World War I, Cust was active in propaganda on behalf of the British Government. In August 1914 he founded the Central Committee for National Patriotic Organizations. He married  'Nina' Welby in 1893.", "*Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland, (1856\u20131937)", "The Coterie, often considered to be the second generation of The Souls, was a celebrated group of intellectuals, a mix of aristocrats, politicians and art-lovers, most of whom were killed in the First World War. There were children of The Souls among them, notably Lady Diana Manners, daughter of Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland. Officially the youngest daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland, she was in fact the daughter of Harry Cust. She married one of the Coterie's few survivors, Duff Cooper, later British Ambassador to France. After his death, she wrote three volumes of memoirs. Raymond Asquith, eldest son of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, was a member of the Coterie, but not out of sympathy with his stepmother, Margot Tennant Asquith. He was killed on the Somme."]}, {"page": "Violet (given name)", "response": ["* Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland (1856-1937), British artist and noblewoman"]}, {"page": "Marion Lindsay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland"]}, {"page": "Marion Margaret Violet Lindsay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland"]}, {"page": "Violet Manners", "response": ["#REDIRECT Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland"]}, {"page": "Marion Margaret Violet Lindsay Manners", "response": ["#REDIRECT Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland"]}, {"page": "Marchioness of Granby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland"]}, {"page": "Violet Manners, Marchioness of Granby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland"]}]}}
