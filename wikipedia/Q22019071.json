Rovers put out a team of players most of whom were England or Scotland internationals, although Wednesday had England internationals Teddy Brayshaw and Billy Betts in their defence. From the kick-off, the Rovers forwards had the Wednesday defence under pressure which led to Jack Dungworth handling the ball on the edge of his goal area in the sixth minute. Forrest took the free kick which fell to Billy Townley whose shot took a deflection for the first goal. Further goals from Nat Walton and Townley gave Rovers a 3\u20130 lead at half-time. The second half continued with Rovers on top with Jack Southworth adding a fourth goal in the fiftieth minute before Albert Mumford was able to score for Wednesday. Further goals from Townley and Joe Lofthouse in the last 15 minutes gave a winning scoreline of 6\u20131 to Rovers. Townley had thus become the first player to score an FA cup final hat-trick. According to Gibbons, \"the Blackburn side had given one of the finest exhibitions of attacking football in an FA cup final, with England internationals Walton, Townley, Lofthouse and John Southworth at the peak of their form.\""]}, {"page": "1897\u201398 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["As expected, Small Heath beat Loughborough, but \"a much more decisive defeat was anticipated\" by the Leicester Chronicle than Abbott's single first-half goal.
