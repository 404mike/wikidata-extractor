They find very different receptions - not just because of social changes but because of the characters and experiences of the \"real\" mothers they belatedly discover. Forster brilliantly conveys the contrasting times, both in attitudes to women and the options on offer for girls who find themselves pregnant outside wedlock. She also achieves a totally unexpected twist which knits together all the story's elements.

Hardyment noted that the audiobook is \"not a substitute for reading, but an add-on, a way of ensuring that you experience as quickly as possible Macfarlane\u2019s labyrinthine journey through our honeycombed planet.\" The Times named the book \"Audiobook of the Week\".
