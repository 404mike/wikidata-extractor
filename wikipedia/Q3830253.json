On Rowlatt's first day at the programme, Peter Barron, the editor, challenged him and his family to spend a year trying to reduce their impact on the environment. It made him an \"accidental green hero\", according to The Guardian. In 2003, that paper had commissioned Leo Hickman to spend a year with his young family on a similar project, which resulted in a book entitled Life Stripped Bare: My Year Trying To Live Ethically. Rowlatt, who acknowledges his debt to Hickman (and to Lucy Siegle, author of Green Living in the Urban Jungle), continued in this vein, focusing on environmental impact, especially his carbon footprint\"We are told climate change is the biggest threat facing the world but is there anything the average family can do about it?

To make as big a cut in the family's carbon footprint as they can.\" from \"Go Green or else\"\"It has been a long year (it actually started last February) but, I think, a successful one.
