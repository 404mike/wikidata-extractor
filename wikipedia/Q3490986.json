It was originally situated in a small bungalow by the beach in Tangasseri, a town on the coast of the Arabian Sea, with ancient Portuguese, English and Dutch settlements, and a once-thriving Anglo-Indian community. The school was inaugurated by Ferdinand Ossi, Bishop of Quilon, as was the convent to which it was associated, on 22 July 1885. In 1889, it was recognised by the Madras Presidency as a 'European Convent School'. It became a high school in 1914. The school was one of the only two employers of Anglo-Indian women in Tangasseri in the mid 20th century, the other being the nearby Infant Jesus Anglo-Indian Boys' High School. The establishment changed its name to Mount Carmel Convent Anglo-Indian Girls School when India gained independence in 1947."]}, {"page": "List of religious institutes", "response": ["|Sisters of the Apostolic Carmel||A.C.||Mother Veronica of the Passion||Carmelite||1870"]}]}}
