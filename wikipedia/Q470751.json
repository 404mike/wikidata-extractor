An attacking full back, he is capable of playing on both flanks but usually plays on his preferred right side.\nHe joined Cardiff City's youth system and was signed by Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a34 million in January 2008. Rarely used at Tottenham, he returned to the Championship with Nottingham Forest, initially on loan, before joining Reading in 2012. He made 314 appearances for Reading before being released in 2020 and moving to Charlton Athletic.\nGunter has been a Welsh international since under-17 level and holds the record as the second youngest debutant for the under-21 team. He made his full international debut in 2007. He was part of the Wales squad that reached the semi-finals at UEFA Euro 2016, also featuring at Euro 2020. In 2017 he was named Welsh Footballer of the Year. He beat Neville Southall's record of 92 caps in 2018, and in 2021 became the first Welshman to earn 100 caps.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1989", "response": ["** Chris Gunter, Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Wales national football team", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Chris Gunter"]}, {"page": "Neville Southall", "response": ["Southall applied for the vacant position, but Bobby Gould was chosen instead, who in turn named Southall and Ian Rush as his assistants. He tried Danny Coyne, Andy Marriott and Tony Roberts in goal in friendly games, but selected Southall for the World Cup qualifying wins over San Marino. A month away from his 39th birthday, he won his final cap against Turkey on 20 August 1997; the Turks won 6\u20134. Southall only played the first half as Gould blamed him for the three goals he conceded \u2013 his replacement Paul Jones went on to concede three himself in the second half. Southall's 92 Welsh caps were a national record until surpassed by Chris Gunter in November 2018. Southall conceded 126 goals, an average of 1.34 per match. The 1958 FIFA World Cup was the only time until the end of his career that Wales qualified for a major tournament and the British Home Championship was played for the final time in 1984, therefore the majority of Southall's caps came in friendlies or qualifying games."]}, {"page": "Gary Speed", "response": ["Having played for the Leeds United youth team, he began his professional career with the club in 1988. With Leeds, he won the English First Division championship in 1991\u201392, and later played for Everton, Newcastle United, Bolton Wanderers and Sheffield United. He captained the Wales national football team until retiring from international football in 2004. He was the most capped outfield player for Wales and the second overall with 85 caps between 1990 and 2004 until being overtaken by Chris Gunter in 2018, playing mainly as a left-sided attacking midfielder. Speed was appointed manager of Sheffield United in 2010, but left the club after a few months in December 2010 to manage the Wales national team, remaining in this role until he took his own life 11 months later.", "Speed played for Wales at youth level and earned three caps for the under-21 team. He played 85 times for Wales, making him the second highest capped player only behind goalkeeper Neville Southall who made 92 appearances until Speed was surpassed by Chris Gunter in 2018. Speed captained Wales on 44 occasions. His first appearance for the national side had come on 20 May 1990 in a 1\u20130 friendly win against Costa Rica at Ninian Park as a second-half replacement for Glyn Hodges. He did not score until his 27th cap, a 3\u20132 away defeat in Moldova in a Euro 1996 qualifier on 12 October 1994.

By mid-November Cardiff found themselves just above the relegation zone; this prompted a minor reshuffle from boss Dave Jones that involved Chris Gunter and Whittingham returning to the starting line-up. Whittingham's recall saw him moved to an unfamiliar role on the right side of midfield, but he soon settled into the role and started the majority of the remaining matches of the season, as well as being the team's top scorer (with three goals) during their FA Cup run. That run saw him score in matches against Chasetown, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Middlesbrough, before Cardiff eventually lost 1\u20130 to Portsmouth in the final."]}, {"page": "Tony Capaldi", "response": ["Capaldi rejected a new contract with Plymouth and on 25 May 2007 he signed a three-year contract with Cardiff City, joining on a Bosman free transfer.

Gilbert began the season as the club's first choice right back and was a regular in the team until December. However, he suffered a minor injury which kept him out for several games. He was replaced by Chris Gunter and was unable to force his way back into the starting line-up, meaning he did not feature as much during the second half of the season.

Blake made his professional debut on 17 April 2006 against Crewe Alexandra in the Football League Championship, following injuries to several first team players, replacing Jeff Whitley as a late substitute during a 1\u20131 draw. The following season, Blake was involved in the first team early, making two appearances in the opening month of the season but made just four further appearances during the first half of the season.
