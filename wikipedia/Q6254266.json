Whilst working at Oxford, Ekert developed a theory of cryptography based on quantum entanglement. A chance meeting on the ski slopes of the Alps with John Rarity, a scientist at DRA (then the UK\u2019s main military research organisation), led to a collaboration in which Ekert\u2019s scheme was tested experimentally in the early 1990s. After finishing his DPhil, Ekert gained a junior research fellowship from Merton and took on his first DPhil student. With Deutsch, this created a small team that within a year had acquired the title of the Quantum Computation and Cryptography Group."]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (J)", "response": ["*John Rarity"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2015", "response": ["# Professor John Rarity"]}]}}
