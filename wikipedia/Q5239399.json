Whilst these intentions were widely known, a number of local Baptist Ministers complained to the Mayor of Tupelo about the inclusion of Elvis Herselvis on the conference program and sought to block funding for the conference. The church's concerns were supported by the organiser of the Elvis birthplace and Museum, then EPE followed suit. Conference organizer Chadwick argued that these actions 'really get interesting when you throw in all the indigenous racism, homophobia, and class distinction that Elvis suffered in the South and throughout his career'. Chadwick received a formal, but diplomatic, letter from EPE's licensing officer which formally withdrew support for the conference.\"David S.
