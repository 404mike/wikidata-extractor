Scannell is one of Cliftonville's all-time leading goalscorers having amassed over 100 goals for the club. His brother Ronan also played for the club.\nBorn in Belfast, Scannell made his senior debut for Cliftonville against Ballymena United in September 1998. Despite a serious injury which threatened to ruin his career, and kept him out of first team action for almost 3 years, Scannell is one of the most prolific strikers in the club's history. He scored 153 goals for the club. Scannell re-signed for the club in January 2005, following a year away in Australia for work reasons, and his performances earned him the honour of captain from the 2008/2009 season. Captaincy was not the only honour Scannell earned that season. Along with adding his name to the list of Cliftonville forwards to score more than 20 goals in one season, Scannell was named Ulster Footballer of the Year and Northern Ireland Football Writers' Association Player of the Year after leading his side to their first Irish Cup Final in a decade. He retired in May 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cliftonville F.C.", "response": ["During the 2008\u201309 campaign Cliftonville struggled in terms of their league performance but finished strongly to secure a top 6 finish. They won the County Antrim Shield and reached the Irish Cup final, 30 years since their previous victory in the competition. Alas it was not to be a victorious occasion with the Reds losing out to their near neighbours, Crusaders.
