In a rare show of kindness, \"for old time's sake\", Matthew gave Perdita a cheque for \u00a320,000, saying Katie could pay him back once she was out of hospital. Just before Perdita left, they had clearly called a truce and it was noted onscreen that the pair briefly kept in touch when Perdy sent Matthew a letter with a picture of her and the baby. In early 2008, Carl felt increasingly isolated in the King business and family and went to work for their rival, Donald De Souza (Michael Jayston). Matthew was furious, especially when Carl interfered with their efforts to win a lucrative contract. One day during a golf game, Carl taunted Matthew about killing their father so Matthew beat Carl with a golf club. Carl refused to press charges but wasn't interested when Matthew apologised. Matthew began taking an increasingly cold approach to business, chasing away Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell), Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) and Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman) for various reasons. He blackmailed Carl's ex, Lexi Nicholls (Sally Oliver), to get a job at De Souza Enterprises and pass information to him which she did, reluctantly. On learning of Carl's upcoming project, Matthew then created an identical one for King & Sons and invited Carl to the unveiling.
