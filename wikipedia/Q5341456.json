Lewis and Merle Randall, and Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of Willard Gibbs (1933), by Edward A. Guggenheim."]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Edward A.

Lambert, and is used in some student textbooks.For example: Atkins, P. W., de Paula J. Atkins' Physical Chemistry, 2006, W.H. Freeman and Company, 8th edition, . Brown, T. L., H. E. LeMay, B. E.
