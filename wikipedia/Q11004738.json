He made his first-class debut for Cambridge University in 1822, playing a single match for the club against the Cambridge Town Club. During the same season, Deedes made his first-class debut for Kent against the Marylebone Cricket Club.\nDeedes next first-class appearance came in 1827 for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players player fixture, in which Deedes appeared in both the Gentlemen v Players fixtures for 1827, as well as representing Kent in a single first-class match against the Marylebone Cricket Club.\nIn 1828 Deedes made his only first-class appearance for Hampshire against an early England team. Deedes also made two further appearances for Kent in 1828, with his final first-class appearance for the county coming against Sussex.\nIn 1829 Deedes played in the unusually named first-class fixture Married v Single, where Deedes represented the Single team, suggesting at this time Deedes was not married or had no partner of sorts. Deedes played a final fixture for the Gentlemen in the 1829 Gentlemen v Players and made a single first-class appearance for England against Surrey.\nDeedes died at Belgravia, Westminster on 11 January 1885.", "link_mentions": {}}}
