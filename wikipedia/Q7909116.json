He is best known as the founder of The Voice, a British weekly newspaper aimed at the Britain's black community, which he established in 1982 as a voice for the British African-Caribbean community. He was honoured as a pioneering publisher for the community, but also faced critics who deemed him sensationalistic.In the 100 Great Black Britons poll conducted in 1997, Val McCalla was voted number 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Seaford, East Sussex", "response": ["* Val McCalla, who was voted in 1997 as one of the top 100 black Britons of all time and was the founder of The Voice, lived in Seaford until his death in 2002."]}, {"page": "The Voice (British newspaper)", "response": ["The Voice was founded in 1982 by Val McCalla, who, while working on a London local paper called the East End News in 1981, led a group of businessmen and journalists in the creation of a weekly newspaper to cater for the interests of British-born African-Caribbean people. Up to that time, the African-Caribbean press in Britain had always addressed a generation of immigrants, relaying news from their countries of origin in the Caribbean and Africa. Publications were named accordingly, with titles such as the West Indian Gazette, West Indian World, The Caribbean Times and West Africa. According to Beulah Ainley, who worked with McCalla on the East End News, \"nobody thought the Voice would work\",Beckett, Andy, \"The Voice in the Wilderness\", The Independent, 11 February 1996. however, as The Independent has noted: \"The previous summer, Brixton had rioted, and African-Caribbean enterprises of all kinds were now being encouraged in the hope of preventing a repetition. London's councils, in particular, were keen to advertise for black staff, and even keener to do so in an African-Caribbean newspaper. McCalla also had a business partner, Alex Pascall, with BBC connections; soon the Corporation was advertising too.\""]}, {"page": "Black British people", "response": ["The black community in Britain has a number of significant publications. The leading key publication is The Voice newspaper, founded by Val McCalla in 1982, and Britain's only national Black weekly newspaper. The Voice primarily targets the Caribbean diaspora and has been printed for more than 35 years. Secondly, the Black History Month magazine is a central point of focus which leads the nationwide celebration of Black History, Arts and Culture throughout the UK. Pride Magazine, published since 1991, is the largest monthly magazine that targets black British, mixed-race, African and African-Caribbean women in the United Kingdom. In 2007, The Guardian reported that the magazine had dominated the black women's magazine market for over 15\u00a0years. Keep The Faith magazine is a multi-award winning Black and minority ethnic community magazine produced quarterly since 2005. Keep The Faiths editorial contributors are some of the most powerful and influential movers and shakers, and successful entrepreneurs within BME communities."]}, {"page": "British African-Caribbean people", "response": ["The Voice newspaper was the primary African-Caribbean newspaper in Britain, and was founded in the early 1980s by Val McCalla. However, today it is owned by a Jamaican publisher and has a Caribbean focus. Pride magazine, which has been going for 21 years, is the largest lifestyle magazine for the community and was described by The Guardian newspaper as the dominant lifestyle magazine for the black community in the UK for over 15 years. Its owner Pride Media also specialises in helping organisations target the community through a range of media. Other publications have included the Gleaner, Black Voice, New Editor and The Caribbean Times. The growth of such media is a response to the perceived imbalances of \"mainstream\" media. In 2006, Sir Ian Blair, Chief Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, joined a long list of commentators in branding the mainstream media as \"institutionally racist\" for its alleged failure to offer a proper balance in reporting affairs related to the community.\"Met chief accuses media of racism\", BBC news online. 26 January 2006.
