His games were notable for containing a large number of sprites and parallax scrolling, features which were largely unknown on the Spectrum at the time.\nHis most notable games include Cobra, (which was a license extremely loosely based on a Sylvester Stallone film) one of the first Spectrum games to exhibit full-colour parallax scrolling and his conversion of the arcade game Green Beret. A notable \"trademark\" of Smith's was his habit of writing his name (with \"Jonathan\" and \"Smith\" spelled various ways) as a mirror-image in his games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mike Follin", "response": ["In CRASH issue 59, Follin cited Knight Lore, Codename MAT and Pentagram as video game classics, with Jonathan Smith as his favorite programmer.

The Apple II version was developed by California-based Quicksilver Software; it requires a 128k IIe or IIc to run.

The disk version contained slightly remixed music and differences in enemy spawns.", "Batman: The Caped Crusader is an arcade adventure which uses a unique style, innovated by Jonathan Smith and Charles Davies, to display the action as though it takes place in a comic book. This technique involved having each game location set in its own panel, often with a comic book style caption in the upper-left corner, with inactive panels faded out behind the current active location. This concept was expanded upon by Sega's Comix Zone seven years later."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2010", "response": ["*Jonathan Smith, 43, British games developer."]}, {"page": "Joffa Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonathan Smith (games programmer)"]}]}}
