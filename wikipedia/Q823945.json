Since 2010, Myatt has written extensively about his rejection of his extremist past and about his rejection of extremism in general. Myatt has translated works of ancient Greek literature, translated and written a commentary on the Greek text of eight tractates of the Corpus Hermeticum, and written several collections of poems. He is currently translating and writing a commentary on the Greek text of the Gospel of John.The counterterrorism author Jon B. Perdue describes Myatt as \"[a] British iconoclast who has lived a somewhat itinerant life and has undertaken an equally desultory intellectual quest\u201d and is \"emblematic of the modern syncretism of radical ideologies\".Myatt is regarded as an \"example of the axis between right-wing extremists and Islamists\", and has been described as an \"extremely violent, intelligent, dark, and complex individual\"; as a martial arts expert; as one of the more interesting figures on the British neo-Nazi scene since the 1970s, and as a key Al-Qaeda propagandist.Before his conversion to Islam in 1998, Myatt was the first leader of the British National Socialist Movement (NSM), and was identified by The Observer, as the \"ideological heavyweight\" behind Combat 18.Myatt came to public attention in 1999, a year after his Islamic conversion, when a pamphlet he allegedly wrote many years earlier, A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution, described as a \"detailed step-by-step guide for terrorist insurrection\", was said to have inspired David Copeland, who left nailbombs in areas frequented by London's black, South Asian, and gay communities. Three people died and 129 were injured in the explosions, several of them losing limbs. It has also been suggested that Myatt's A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution might have influenced the German National Socialist Underground.In 2021 The Counter Extremism Project listed Myatt as one of the world's 20 most dangerous extremists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Satanism", "response": ["Various academics have argued that Long is the pseudonym of British National Socialist Movement activist David Myatt, an allegation that Myatt has denied."]}, {"page": "Superhuman", "response": ["The Neo-Nazi David Myatt advocated in the early 1990s that after the Western Imperium, a proposed future autocratic state governing all the areas inhabited by the Aryan race, is established, and the birth rate of the Aryan race is brought up from its present level of about 1.6 to a replacement rate of 2.1, that then a new super-race called Homo Galactica should be created by genetic engineering from the most perfect Aryans, which by then will have themselves been improved through genetic enhancement. This new super race would be genetically engineered to have super brains, super senses, and more delicate hands to be able to travel in starships, which would be sent out to colonize the entire Milky Way Galaxy with the descendants of Aryans."]}, {"page": "National Socialist Movement (United Kingdom)", "response": ["The roots of the NSM lay in a split that developed in Combat 18 in the mid to late 1990s.

Whilst Sargent was disowned by some of the rank and file membership of C18, his brother Steve, also a C18 member, supported Sargent and together with David Myatt led away fifty or so like-minded members to form a separate group, the National Socialist Movement, in June 1997.", "David Myatt was the first leader of the NSM Goodrick-Clark, N.
