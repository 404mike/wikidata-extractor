Simmons was born in Moseley, Birmingham. Following elementary education, he became a Primitive Methodist lay preacher at the age of 16. In World War I he served in the Worcestershire Regiment, seeing action in France, Egypt and Gallipoli. He was twice imprisoned whilst in the army, for protesting against field punishments and for appearing in uniform at a peace rally. He was wounded three times, the last at Vimy in Spring 1916, as a result of which his lower leg was amputated. Discharged from the army in November 1917 he continued campaigning for peace but was arrested in February 1918 and sentenced to three months imprisonment in Armley Gaol.After WW1, Simmons became a leading member of the National Union of Ex-Servicemen (NUX), a socialist group which fought for the rights of those returning from the war. Following the demise of the NUX as a national body, Simmons remained active on these issues in local organisations and when later elected to Parliament lobbied persistently on behalf of the British Limbless Ex-Servicemen's Association (BLESMA). A Christian Socialist, he also played a leading role in the Labour Church movement.He gained political office as a member of Birmingham City Council from 1921\u20131931 and 1942\u20131945.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Simmons"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Simmons"]}, {"page": "New Party (UK)", "response": ["On 6 December 1930, Mosley published an expanded version of the \"Mosley Memorandum\", which was signed by Mosley, his wife and fellow Labour MP Lady Cynthia and 15 other Labour MPs: Oliver Baldwin, Joseph Batey, Aneurin Bevan, W.
