Her claim to have given birth to various animal parts prompted the arrival of John Howard, a local surgeon, who investigated the matter.  He delivered several pieces of animal flesh and duly notified other prominent physicians, which brought the case to the attention of Nathaniel St. Andr\u00e9, surgeon to the Royal Household of King George I.\nSt. Andr\u00e9 concluded that Toft's case was genuine but the king also sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers, who remained skeptical.  By then quite famous, Toft was brought to London where she was studied in detail; under intense scrutiny and producing no more rabbits she confessed to the hoax, and was subsequently imprisoned as a fraud.\nThe resultant public mockery created panic within the medical profession and ruined the careers of several prominent surgeons. The affair was satirised on many occasions, not least by the pictorial satirist and social critic William Hogarth, who was notably critical of the medical profession's gullibility. Toft was eventually released without charge and returned home.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1726", "response": ["* November \u2013 Mary Toft allegedly gives birth to 16 rabbits in England; the story is later revealed to be a hoax."]}, {"page": "Leicester Square", "response": ["In 1726, anatomist Nathaniel St Andr\u00e9 claimed to have delivered rabbits from Mary Toft, a woman who lived at No.\u00a027 Leicester Square.
