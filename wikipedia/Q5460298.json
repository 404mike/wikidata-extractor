In 1770, Johan Zoffany had been able to paint the King, the Queen, and all six eldest children with little difficulty. In 1785, however, John Singleton Copley had so much difficulty getting the dogs, birds, and especially the three royal children to sit still that he never painted another portrait. Compared to the carefully planned education that Charlotte, Augusta, and Elizabeth had been given, the education given to Mary, Sophia, and Amelia was based solely on what had come before. Amelia was only five years old when her father suffered his first bout of madness. As a consequence of her father's declining health, she never experienced the closeness and affection that had characterized the family during her elder sisters' early years.Princesses, Flora Fraser"]}, {"page": "1996 Whitbread Awards", "response": ["*Flora Fraser, The Unruly Queen: The Life of Queen Caroline"]}, {"page": "Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh", "response": ["According to Flora Fraser, Mary was considered to be the most beautiful daughter of George III; Fraser calls her a \"bland beauty\".

Around 1796 Mary fell in love with the Dutch Prince Frederick, while he and his family lived in exile in London. Frederik was a son of William V, Prince of Orange, the Dutch stadholder, and younger brother to the future King William I of the Netherlands. However Frederik and Mary never wed because George III stipulated that her elder sisters should marry first.

Some historians contend that, sometime before August 1800 in Weymouth, Sophia gave birth to a child fathered by Garth. Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has questioned whether the child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure."]}, {"page": "Flora Fraser", "response": ["Flora Fraser may refer to:", "*Flora Fraser (writer)", "*Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun"]}, {"page": "John Conroy", "response": ["Princess Sophia's substantial income, provided from the civil list, had allowed Conroy to enjoy a wealthy lifestyle.

The Duke of Cambridge and the Duchess of Gloucester had a lawyer write to Conroy demanding that he account for the rest of their sister Sophia's funds, but Conroy simply ignored it. According to Flora Fraser, the most recent biographer of George III's daughters, Princess Sophia had in fact personally spent huge sums on Conroy, including heavy contributions to the purchase prices of his residences and supporting his family in a style he judged appropriate to their position.

He spoke of her \"unbounded power\" over Nelson, and complained that the vice-admiral's \"extravagant love\" had made him \"the laughing stock of the whole fleet.\" Lock became famous for the salacious letters he wrote home in which he denounced Lady Hamilton and Lord Nelson. Flora Fraser describes his letters as \"long, vituperative screeds about the horrors of Lady Hamilton.\" The letters Lock wrote contained \"scabrous comments\" and gained a wide circulation back in the United Kingdom among those who wished to attack the government by attacking its servants.Russell 1969, p. 98"]}, {"page": "Lady Charlotte Finch", "response": ["The historian Flora Fraser writes that \"in many ways, the education... ordered for the princesses would be as rigorous as\" that which the king ordered for the princes.

Subjects included geography, English, grammar, music, needlework, dancing, and art. A tutor, Julie Krohme, taught the children in the French language. Once old enough, the princesses would travel each day to receive their education at Finch's new house at Kew alongside the river. Conversely, the princes gradually saw less of Lady Charlotte as they became older and entered into the care of governors.
