When the case came to court the judge recorded a not guilty verdict. Jones later spoke of his bitterness about the handling of the case and claimed it was the cause of his father's death, who had died shortly after the allegations became public.In 2001, Jones became the manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers, guiding the club to promotion to the Premier League in the 2002\u201303 season, though they were relegated the following season and he was dismissed by Wolves in November 2004.\nJones had a six-year spell in charge of Cardiff City between 2005 and 2011.
