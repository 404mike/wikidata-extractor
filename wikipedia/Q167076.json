However, Jones also notes that British banks in this period were allowed to disguise their profits by making transfers to or from \"inner\" or \"secret\" reserves before reaching their published profits figure. The Imperial bank's real profits were on average twice as high as the published profits between 1890 and 1952.B. V. Anan'ich, Rossikoe Samoderzhavi i Vyvoz Kapitalov (Leningrad: 1975).
