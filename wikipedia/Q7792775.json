Anthropologist Christopher Fuller has said that, \"The Nayars' marriage system has made them one of the most famous of all communities in anthropological circles\". Thomas Nossiter has commented that their system, which included the pre-pubertal thalikettu kalyanam rite and permitted both hypergamy and a form of polyandry, \"was so loosely arranged as to raise doubts as to whether 'marriage' existed at all.\" Men and women could both have several partners, and they could both break away from those partners and take other partners with a minimum of effort."]}, {"page": "Ezhava", "response": ["The lowly status of the Ezhava meant that, as Thomas Nossiter has commented, they had \"little to lose and much to gain by the economic and social changes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\". They sought the right to be treated as worthy of an English education and for jobs in government administration to be open to them. An early Ezhava campaigner and their \"political father\", according to Ritty Lukose, was Padmanabhan Palpu. In 1896, he organised a petition of 13,176 signatories that was submitted to the Maharajah of the princely state of Travancore, asking for government recognition of the Ezhavas' right to work in public administration and to have access to formal education. Around this time, nearly 93 per cent of the caste members were illiterate. The upper caste Hindus of the state prevailed upon the Maharajah not to concede the request. The outcome not looking to be promising, the Ezhava leadership threatened that they would convert from Hinduism en masse, rather than stay as helots of Hindu society. C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer, realising the imminent danger, prompted the Maharajah to issue the Temple Entry Proclamation, which abolished the ban on lower-caste people from entering Hindu temples in the state. Steven Wilkinson says that the Proclamation was passed because the government was \"frightened\" by the Ezhava threat of conversion to Christianity."]}, {"page": "Dr Thomas Nossiter", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Nossiter"]}, {"page": "Nossiter", "response": ["*Thomas Nossiter   L.S.E professor"]}, {"page": "Edward Duyker", "response": ["Professor Thomas Nossiter of the London School of Economics praised Duyker's Tribal Guerrillas because 'it exemplifies the value of synthesising anthropology and history; and, more generally, it is a scholarly contribution to a literature on tribal rebellion and insurgency far wider than India, which embraces Greece, Vietnam and Algeria as well as sub-Saharan Africa where tribal responses to imperialism and modernisation have been significant' (Third World Quarterly, vol. 11, no. 2, April 1989, pp.\u00a0226\u20137). This meeting ground between history and anthropology can also be seen in An Officer of the Blue, Duyker's biography of Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne, in which he skilfully used missionary and other accounts of M\u0101ori oral history and French journals to explain the circumstances of the explorer's death in New Zealand's Bay of Islands in 1772.
