In May 2007, Moxon was confirmed as Director of Professional Cricket at Yorkshire, a role which he left in December 2021 in the wake of the Yorkshire County Cricket Club racism scandal in which he had been embroiled.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["His success on the field resumed in 1985, where he scored 1,657\u00a0runs at 75.31, second only to Viv Richards in the national averages. He also shared a record opening partnership of 351 with Martyn Moxon. In contrast to the poor relations between Boycott and the senior players, many junior members of the team remember 1985 and 1986 as pleasant times to be around Boycott, who often coached them on their technique.McKinstry, p. 253. 1986 saw Boycott score 890\u00a0runs at 52.35, his season cut short by injuries which were becoming more frequent as he passed the age of 45.McKinstry, p. 255. This season was the first since 1962 that he had not hit an overall total of 1,000\u00a0runs; he finished eight short in his final match, when he was run out for 61. He advised the then captain to enforce the follow-on, and did not bat again. Since 1984, support for Boycott had waned in light of his slow scoring, multiple injuries and the general atmosphere around him. Both Brian Close and Ray Illingworth increasingly advocated his removal to Yorkshire's committee, and on 23 September 1986 it was confirmed that he would not be offered a contract for the following year. A few months later, captain David Bairstow, a long term ally of Boycott whose leadership had Boycott's support, was ruled out of the running for captaincy for the following season, which was instead given to Phil Carrick, of whom Boycott disapproved. Boycott paid tribute to the Reform Group in 1987, describing them as \"dedicated Yorkshire members with a heartfelt stake in their club.\" He suggests that Close and Illingworth feared his popularity.Boycott, p. 297. Boycott was offered contracts by other counties, including Derbyshire and Glamorgan, but he never took these offers up, nor played professional cricket again.McKinstry, pp. 257\u2013258. At the time of his retirement he had scored more first-class runs than any other active player.Boycott, p. 375."]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Martyn Moxon"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Martyn Moxon", "* 2007-2021 Martyn Moxon"]}, {"page": "Steve Ogrizovic", "response": ["Ogrizovic was also a cricketer, reaching Minor Counties level as a medium-fast bowler.

Under Cook's guidance, Durham won their first major title in the club's history at Lord's in 2007, and went on to win the County Championship for the first time in 2008, and again in 2009.

The selectors decided that as Rashid had progressed to the next level of cricket, having appeared for England Lions, and therefore he shouldn't be pulled out of county cricket to play for England Under-19s. In continuing to play county cricket, he scored his maiden first-class century, 108 against Worcestershire at Kidderminster, and another half-century against Warwickshire.", "Just hours before the start of the 2013 county season, Rashid was quoted by the Independent as saying that if his 2013 season didn't go well he'd request to go on loan from Yorkshire to a different county, which forced Yorkshire to deny that there was any rift between Rashid and the club. Martyn Moxon, then Yorkshire's director of cricket, said that the interview had been in January, months before the start of the season and that there hadn't been any issues. Rashid also showed that his poor form was behind him as he started the season with his highest first-class score, a 180 against Somerset. He followed this up with two more centuries, one against Warwickshire and a second against Somerset, taking his average for the county season up to that point above 200. In 2014 Rashid continued to improve his bowling, particularly in limited overs cricket, bowling career-best figures of 5/33 in a one-day match against Hampshire."]}, {"page": "Bicentennial Test", "response": ["* Martyn Moxon"]}, {"page": "Ian Dews", "response": ["On 8 March 2007, Dews was confirmed as part of the Yorkshire first team management set-up.

Martyn Moxon fell to a third ball duck in the first over, caught by Waugh at point slashing at an out-swinger from Terry Alderman. Debutant Mike Atherton went two balls later, fooled by Alderman's now trademark in-swinging yorker which trapped him in front to be out LBW. England ended the first over 2 for 1. Tim Curtis fared little better, out a few overs later for 2, also out LBW to Alderman. Robin Smith and David Gower went someway to stabilising the England innings, but when captain Gower was tempted to play at an off-cutter outside the off stump by Geoff Lawson he got an outside edge and was caught behind for 11. Once again keeper Jack Russell was called upon to try to provide some lower order resistance for a failing England line-up. He did so, this time in the form of providing support for Smith, who started to look comfortable where the others had failed. Smith's stroke-play became audacious, even elegant at times. He soon moved past 50, but lost Russell soon after. The keeper-batsman caught behind by Healy off Lawson for 20. Hemmings likewise provided good support for Smith, chiming in with a useful 38, and helping Smith take the England total past 200 before he was spectacularly clean-bowled by Alderman. Smith soon crept over the line to make a well made century, but he was out 1 run later for 101, caught behind by Healy off Alderman, giving the West Australian yet another 5 wicket haul, his fifth of the series so far.
