Two second-half Jabo Ibehre goals proved to be the difference. Just three days later, on 5 March, Stevenage ended their run of defeats by beating high-flying Brentford 1\u20130 at Broadhall Way. Having dominated the match for large spells, the home side took the lead with fifteen minutes left when Marcus Haber dinked the ball over Simon Moore in the Brentford goal. Stevenage then lost 2\u20130 away to Preston North End on 9 March, with goals from Lee Holmes and Will Hayhurst in the opening fifteen minutes settling the match. Another defeat followed three days later, with the club losing 1\u20130 at home to Bournemouth. A first-half Brett Pitman penalty was the only goal of the game, as Darius Charles was sent-off late-on for a second bookable offence. Stevenage's next match, played four days later, was a 4\u20130 home victory over second-placed Sheffield United. Returning from a loan spell at Barnet, striker Dani L\u00f3pez made his first start for the club; opening the scoring just before half-time after turning Neill Collins inside the area and beating George Long in the Sheffield United goal. He then added a second shortly after the interval when he neatly converted a chipped through ball by Gavin Mahon.  L\u00f3pez scored his hat-trick just after the hour mark when Anthony Grant broke free and played a through ball to the Spanish forward, who then unleashed an unstoppable shot from just inside the area. Lucas Akins added Stevenage's fourth goal of the match with twenty minutes to go when he cut inside and beat Long with a low curling shot. Just three days after the club's impressive win over Sheffield United, Stevenage lost 2\u20130 to bottom-placed Bury at Gigg Lane. Goals from Craig Jones and Jonson Clarke-Harris, both of which coming within the final ten minutes of the match, proved to be the difference. Stevenage goalkeeper Steve Arnold also saved a first-half Steven Schumacher penalty. A day after the defeat by Bury, on 20 March, Stevenage announced that manager Gary Smith had been sacked following a run of 14 defeats in 18 games. Stevenage captain Mark Roberts was placed in caretaker charge while the club searched for a new manager, but could not prevent a 3\u20131 defeat by Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park on 24 March, a game that was televised live on Sky Sports. Tranmere went ahead after ten minutes when Zoumana Bakayoko tapped in from close range, before Stevenage equalised almost instantly courtesy of a curling Luke Freeman free-kick. Just three minutes later, on the fifteen-minute mark, Tranmere had regained their lead; Stevenage failed to clear a Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro shot and the ball fell to defender Ben Gibson, whose shot went in following a deflection off David Gray. Bakayoko then doubled his goal tally and Tranmere's advantage shortly before the interval when he tucked away Paul Black's through pass. Five days later, Roberts took charge of the side for their trip to Broadfield Stadium to face Crawley Town. Full back Miguel Comminges was sent-off for two bookable offences after just half an hour. Despite being a man light, Stevenage took the lead just before the interval when David Gray headed on Luke Freeman's free-kick, and Roberts was on hand to head the ball into the goal from six yards. Crawley equalised ten minutes into the second-half after Matt Sparrow tucked the ball into the bottom corner of the goal. Both sides had chances to take all three points, but the game ended 1\u20131. A day after the draw to Crawley, on 30 March, Stevenage announced that Graham Westley had been re-appointed as the club's new manager, his third spell in-charge of the Hertfordshire side."]}, {"page": "List of York City F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["|Preston North End|| Soccerbase credit the second goal York scored against Scunthorpe United on 3 May 2014 to Will Hayhurst.
