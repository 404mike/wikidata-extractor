On 30 October, Doyle helped Bradford into the quarter-finals of the League Cup by scoring his penalty in their penalty shoot-out victory over Wigan Athletic, after the game had finished 0\u20130 after extra time. Doyle was shown a red card in a 3\u20133 draw with Bristol Rovers on 24 November for allegedly kicking Seanan Clucas, resulting in a three-match ban. However, Bradford manager Phil Parkinson appealed the decision, which was overturned the following day by an independent Football Association panel. Doyle scored his first goals for the club on 12 February 2013, scoring twice in a 3\u20130 win away at Wycombe Wanderers. He was named in the starting lineup for the 2013 Football League Cup Final against Swansea City at Wembley Stadium on 24 February 2013, resulting in a 5\u20130 defeat. Bradford went on to secure a place in the League Two play-offs after a 1\u20130 win at home to Burton Albion on 20 April. Doyle played in both semi-final legs against Burton Albion, which Bradford won 5\u20134 on aggregate. Bradford played Northampton Town in the 2013 Football League Two play-off Final on 18 May, their second appearance at Wembley Stadium of the season and won the match 3\u20130, thereby earning promotion to League One. During the match, Doyle assisted Rory McArdle for Bradford's second goal with a cross. Following the end of the season, Doyle signed a new one-year contract with Bradford on 3 July.

His impressive performance caught the attention of the club's legend Billy Williamson who said he believed Magennis can achieve same the level of success at the club that he did. Soon after scoring his first goal of the season, Manager Craig Brown began negotiating with Magennis to sign a new contract. Due to the club's injury crisis, Magennis said he was willing to play in any position if any players suffered an injury.
