Taking over for Jason Shackell, Heaton was named as captain for the 2015\u201316 season, captaining the team for the first time on 8 August 2015, on the opening day of the 2015\u201316 Championship season against Leeds United in a 1\u20131 draw. Heaton kept 20 clean sheets during the season, second only to Dimitrios Konstantopoulos of Middlesbrough, as Burnley did not lose in the second half of the Championship season on their way to becoming champions and earning promotion back to the Premier League at their first attempt. Towards the end of the season, Heaton was named in the Championship PFA Team of the Year."]}, {"page": "Adam Drury (footballer, born 1978)", "response": ["In the close season of 2004 Norwich signed competition for Drury in the shape of the experienced Simon Charlton from Bolton Wanderers but Charlton often ended up playing in the centre of defence with Drury retaining his place on the left. Loss of form during the 2004\u201305 Premier League season did lead to Drury being dropped for a short time and he was relieved of the captaincy (which passed to Craig Fleming) until the start of the 2006\u201307 season when he was re-instated. Towards the end of the 2004\u201305 season he found his form again and turned in an outstanding display as part of the Norwich team that beat Manchester United 2\u20130 at Carrow Road. He continued to be a key member of the Norwich squad on their return to the Championship for season 2005\u201306. Norwich manager Nigel Worthington named Drury as Norwich City captain for the 2006\u201307 season, though Worthington's successor Peter Grant awarded the captaincy to Jason Shackell at the beginning of the 2007\u201308 campaign."]}, {"page": "Gary Doherty", "response": ["At Norwich City his career started well, with him having a regular place at the heart of the defence, but he lost his place in February to Jason Shackell and Norwich were eventually relegated. The following season, however, saw Doherty established as a regular choice at centre-back and his form and consistency improved considerably. Although Norwich had a difficult and disappointing 2005\u201306 season, the supporters recognised Doherty's contribution by voting him Norwich City player of the year."]}, {"page": "Rossi Jarvis", "response": ["It would be almost a year on from the League Cup game at Rotherham until Jarvis next played a competitive game for Norwich. With suspensions to Dion Dublin, Jason Shackell, and Julien Brellier, Jarvis started in a League Cup Third Round tie on 25 September 2007 away to then Premier League high-flyers Manchester City, along with fellow academy graduate Michael Spillane. Both players performances drew high praise from the media, as Norwich lost the game 1\u20130. Jarvis started his first ever league game for Norwich against Sheffield Wednesday four days later, and went on to start in three further games. However, he failed to feature under new Canaries manager Glenn Roeder, who was appointed on 30 October 2007, and was released by the club in May 2008."]}, {"page": "Bobby Hassell", "response": ["When Mark Robins was appointed Barnsley manager following the start of the 2009-10 season, Hassell initially dropped out of the team, yet soon found his way back in due to consistent performances and a high work rate. Hassell was made Barnsley vice-captain in the summer of 2010 when Robins handed the captaincy to Jason Shackell. The 2010-11 season was another successful one for Hassell who made his 200th league start for Barnsley against Millwall in January."]}, {"page": "Jake Buxton", "response": ["Ahead of the 2012\u201313 season, Buxton was placed as Derby's most experience available defender following the sale of Jason Shackell to Burnley and the injury to Barker, and Nigel Clough stated his faith in Buxton's ability to become a first team regular at Championship level, Buxton opened the season with three goals in two games, with a brace in a 5\u20135 League Cup draw with Scunthorpe United and a strike in the opening league game against Sheffield Wednesday. Buxton spent the start of the season in and out of the starting line-up, competing with new signing James O'Connor to start alongside captain Richard Keogh, a battle Buxton was winning until he was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 3\u20130 loss at Peterborough United on 27 October 2012. After several games on the bench after his suspension, Buxton returned to the starting before being ruled out for two months after picking up a knee injury following his goal in a 3\u20131 win against Leeds United. Buxton returned to first team action in a 2\u20132 draw at Sheffield Wednesday and was praised for his courage by Clough after he was forced to start at short notice due to an injury picked up by Mark O'Brien in the pre-match warm-up. Buxton retained his place in the starting line-up alongside Keogh and scored his fifth goal of the season with an 88th-minute winner in a 2\u20131 win at Leeds United on 1 April. Later on in the month, Buxton signed a new two-year contract."]}, {"page": "Stephen Foster (footballer)", "response": ["Foster was appointed Barnsley club captain until the start of the 2010/11 season when the captaincy was passed to new signing Jason Shackell to enable Foster to concentrate on his own game.

As a result, Manager Sean Dyche placed him in a midfielder position on several occasions following a midfield crisis. Although he played out different positions in both defender and midfielder, he was also placed on the substitute bench. It wasn't until on February 9, 2013 when he scored his first Burnley goal, in a 2\u20131 loss against Bolton Wanderers. His second goal of the season then came on April 20, 2013, in a 1\u20131 draw against Cardiff City. He went on to make thirty appearances (twenty\u2013seven in the league) and scoring two times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Shaun Barker", "response": ["As a result, Barker missed the first 16 games of the following season, returning to action in a reserve fixture against Sheffield United on 15 November 2011. He made his first team return as a late substitute in a 2\u20130 defeat against Hull City on 19 November 2011, making his first start in a 3\u20131 defeat at West Ham United on 26 November. Barker retained his place in the side where he partnered Jason Shackell in central defence, starting 21 games together, with Derby winning 8, drawing 4, losing 9 games and conceding 23 goals. On 13 March, in a game against Nottingham Forest Barker was involved in a collision and after a 6-minute break in the game was substituted and rushed off to hospital with a suspected broken leg. A day after the game, Barker was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a dislocated kneecap. However, on 22 March 2012 after further scans in hospital, Barker was facing a 16-month recovery from his injury, (ruling him out of the entire 2012\u201313 season) after rupturing his medial, anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligaments. Barker also had a 3 hour operation to remove damage to the patellar ligament, Barker will also wear a brace to the first 8 weeks to help protect the dislocated knee. Barker remains optimistic for a full recovery. Surgeon Dr Andrew Williams said in April 2012 that he was happy with the progress Barker had made in his injury recovery after his first check-up, with Barker expected to be in a leg brace and crutches for at least 12 weeks. Barker has also spent 6 hours a day in a Kneehab XP, which Barker calls a \"machine of death\" the machine helps rebuild quadriceps muscles through set spells of contraction and relaxation. Barker has also spent time in an ice machine.", "Because he would miss the 2012\u201313 season due to his injury, Barker was not given a squad number, with Nigel Clough allocating his no.5 shirt to Jake Buxton. Despite this, Clough stated that Barker will play an \"important part\" in the season as club captain despite being on the sidelines all season. Clough said; \"Shaun is going to be as important as ever; he is a great leader. He will be around the place and it will be a case of us supporting him, then him supporting us as well. We will help get Shaun through the next 12 months or so, but we feel as though he can be a major positive on the first team squad. He won't be moping around, he won't be sulking, he will be his usual positive self around the place and he is good to have around.\" Clough also said he saw similarities between Barker and club captain Richard Keogh, who joined the club as a replacement for the sold Jason Shackell. Despite this injury, Barker signed a one-year extension to his contract in September 2012, which extended his stay at the club until the summer of 2015. In February 2013. eleven months after his injury, it was reported that Barker had undergone three further operations and his rehab was stepped up by taking part in swimming sessions, Barker stated his relief at being able to exercise and step his recovery outside of Derby's training facility at Moor Farm and was again hopeful for a return to the Derby County team."]}, {"page": "Keith Treacy", "response": ["Treacy started the season well when he scored his first goal of the season and his first appearance of the 2013\u201314 season, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute, in a 3\u20130 win over Yeovil Town on 17 August 2013. After the match, Treacy praised Dyche for putting his career on track and credited the fitness coach Mark Howard for helping him lose weight and improving his physique. Treacy then set up a goal for Jason Shackell on 31 August 2013, in a 3\u20130 win over Derby County. However throughout the 2013\u201314 season, Treacy's first team was largely restricted to substitute appearances, due to strong competitions in Burnley's midfield positions. He also faced sidelined, including a suspension following his sending off against West Ham United in the fourth round of the EFL Cup on 29 October 2013, as the club lost 2\u20130. Treacy's second goal later came on 15 February 2014, in a 1\u20131 draw against AFC Bournemouth. His contributions helped Burnley gain promotion to the Premier League for the first time since 2009. At the end of the 2013\u201314 season, he went on to make thirty\u2013one appearances and scoring once in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Richard Keogh", "response": ["On 19 July 2012, Keogh signed a three-year contract at Derby County, for an undisclosed fee believed to be in excess of \u00a31 million. A day later, Keogh was named Derby's new captain, replacing the departed Jason Shackell, who covered the role after Shaun Barker's season-long injury. Keogh was also captain at Coventry and said, \"I thrive on the pressure. I feel it brings out the best in me. It's something I look forward to and I cannot wait to get out there and play.\"", "Keogh was again considered the first choice centre-back at the club by Clough ahead of the 2013\u201314 season. During the 2013\u201314 season, a mistake by Keogh led to Bobby Zamora scoring the winning goal in stoppage time of the Championship play-off final. In September 2014, he signed a new three-year contract with Derby. In April 2015, he was named in the Championship PFA Team of the Year. Keogh was an ever-present alongside Jason Shackell at the heart of Derby's defence as the side lost out 3\u20132 on aggregate to Hull in the Championship playoff semi-final."]}, {"page": "Mark Fotheringham (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["The 2007\u201308 season began well for Fotheringham, as he scored his first goal for the club in a 5\u20132 League Cup win over Barnet. However, on 18 August 2007, he suffered ankle ligament damage in a match against Southampton which kept him out of action for more than two months. Fotheringham returned to the Norwich side under new Canaries manager Glenn Roeder and for a while became a permanent fixture in the side. For Norwich's home match with Plymouth Argyle on 4 December 2007, Fotheringham was made Norwich captain in the absence of Jason Shackell and was subsequently given the role on a permanent basis."]}]}}
