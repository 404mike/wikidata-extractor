Although he played for the city reserves, he never made the progression to their first team, and in 1946 he joined local side Soundwell.\nBush's single season spent with Soundwell was a successful one, and the club finished as runners-up in Division Two of the Western League. His performances were good enough to earn him a second spell with a Football League club, when he signed his first professional contract for Bristol Rovers in 1947. He remained with \"The Pirates\" for eight years, until 1955, making 114 league appearances and scoring 19 goals.\nFollowing his departure from Bristol Rovers, Bush spent a single season with Trowbridge Town, before having an unsuccessful trial with Bath City in 1956. He then spent two years with Wells City before finishing his playing days with Bitton, the town where he had worked as a butcher at the start of his working life.\nLater in life he had worked as a salesman, before dying from a stroke on 25 August 2008, at the age of 83.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trowbridge Town F.C.", "response": ["*Bryan Bush"]}, {"page": "Soundwell F.C.", "response": ["Soundwell produced several young players who went on to become professionals, mostly with Bristol Rovers.
