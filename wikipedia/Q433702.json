Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as Florin Raducioiu; Davor \u0160uker, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances; Christian Bassila, who cost \u00a3720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football; Titi Camara; Gary Charles, whose wages amounted to \u00a34.4\u00a0million but made only three starts for the club; Rigobert Song; Paulo Futre; and Marco Boogers, a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League. His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks, while his third season would also see another relegation battle.
