Leake had an excellent debut, setting up Christopherson's first try after eluding his Welsh counterpart Hugh Ingledew. England won 7\u20133, and Leake was rewarded for his confident start with selection for the next two games of the tournament. Leake, partnered at half back with John Berry, was part of a winning England team in the second game, against Ireland, but England lost to Scotland in the Championship decider. The next season, the English selectors chose the Bradford pairing of Emmott and Briggs at half back, and Leake never represented his county again."]}, {"page": "Ingledew", "response": ["*Hugh Ingledew (1865\u20131937), Welsh rugby player"]}]}}
