This was in the aftermath of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, a joint operation by Egyptian Islamic Jihad and Al-Qaeda (the two would merge in 2001), killing 224 people. The \"Londonistan\" situation, as it was known, had long being criticised by some of the leading Arab world governments such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and others, who regarded the groups as a threat to their national security also. After the arrests, Omar Bakri described Britain in Al-Ahram Weekly as \"the spearhead of blasphemy that seeks to overthrow Muslims and the Islamic caliphate\" and claimed that the seven men had been \"lulled and betrayed into believing they could seek sanctuary in Britain from their corrupt regimes\", claiming that Britain was motivated by a desire for \"future economic favours\" from the likes of Saudi Arabia. Six months after the arrests, Al-Muhajiroun and others staged a demonstration in front of 10 Downing Street to protest the continued incarceration of the seven men and they, including al-Sibai were eventually released.al-Sharq al-Awsat, \"Islamic fundamentalist groups planning 12 March Downing St. Protest\", 5 March 1999 Tony Blair, who was the Labour Party's Prime Minister at the time of the arrests, two decades later in 2017 accused al-Sibai of having radicalised members of the so-called \"Beatles\" group of ISIS militants, including \"Jihadi John\" (Mohammed Emwazi) and El Shafee Elsheikh."]}, {"page": "Eccles, Greater Manchester", "response": ["The humanitarian aid worker Alan Henning was from Eccles before he was murdered by Jihadi John."]}, {"page": "Shinzo Abe", "response": ["On a tour of the Middle East in January 2015, Abe announced that Japan would provide 200\u00a0million dollars in non-military assistance to countries fighting against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as part of a 2.5\u00a0billion-dollar aid package. Shortly after this, ISIL released a video in which a masked figure (identified as Mohammed Emwazi or \"Jihadi John\") threatened to kill two Japanese hostages, Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa, in retaliation for the move unless Abe's government paid 200\u00a0 million dollars of ransom money. Abe cut short his trip to deal with the crisis, declared that such acts of terrorism were \"unforgivable\" and promised to save the hostages while refusing to pay the ransom. The Abe cabinet worked with the Jordanian government to attempt to secure the release of both hostages, after further videos were released by ISIL linking their fate to that of the pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh, with deputy foreign minister Yasuhide Nakayama conducting negotiations in Amman. Both hostages were killed, ISIL releasing news of Yukawa's death on 24 January and Goto's on 31 January. Abe condemned the killings as a \"heinous act\", declared that Japan would \"not give in to terrorism\" and pledged to work with the international community to bring the killers to justice. There was some criticism of Abe for his move to pledge aid against ISIL while they were holding Japanese citizens hostage, but polls showed support for his administration increasing in the aftermath of the crisis.
