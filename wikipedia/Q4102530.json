Other authors included Jack London, H.G. Wells, and Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman. Fiction, in the form of short stories and serialisations, was released during the magazine's entire span and took up a sizable proportion in issues. A slightly higher percentage of these contributions were written by women. The type of fiction varied, from romances and domestic narratives to fantasies and sociopolitical stories. The publication's targeted reader was the \"New Woman\", with enlightened ideas on education, health, independence, and employment. Victorian scholar Kathryn Ledbetter notes that The Lady's Realm was \"a handbook to the New Woman then being successfully marketed in popular novels... it provides many examples of this ideal in essays, illustrations, fiction, and poetry through the late 1890s\"."]}, {"page": "Mary Montgomerie Currie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Violet Fane"]}]}}
