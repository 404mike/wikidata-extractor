When in 1959 he was awarded a coveted French Government Bourse to study etching at S W Hayter's, renown Atelier 17 in Paris, (where some revolutionary new techniques of plate making and colour printing were being explored) he took with him a copy of the recently published collection of Graham's poems titled The Night Fishing. This work became the inspiration for a suite of etchings which Anthony named An Homage to the Night Fishing. These fresh, colourful etchings have the energy of Tachist paintings. The Bourse Committee, very impressed with the work, extended Anthony's study time by a month, so he could finish his work. Some test proofs were printed at the time, but the plates were not editioned somehow they were misplaced during a studio move and not found again until the late 1990s when Anthony's nephew and printer, Simon Marsh discovered them, still wrapped in a French newspaper. Partial editions were then printed. They were shown in an Exhibition curated by Chris Stephens, about Sidney Graham and his artist friends. The suite of innovative prints is now in the Tate Britain Collection."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Simon Marsh"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["| 10 April 2001 || Simon Marsh || Released || (Tamworth)", "!scope=\"row\"|Simon Marsh"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["| 10 December 1998 || Simon Marsh || Oxford United || \u00a3250,000", "!scope=\"row\"|Simon Marsh"]}, {"page": "Simon Marsh (disambiguation)", "response": ["Simon Marsh is a footballer.", "Simon Marsh may also refer to:", "*Simon Marsh (MP)", "*Simon Marsh, executive producer of Celebrity Super Spa"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Simon Marsh", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Simon Marsh", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Simon Marsh", "| Simon Marsh"]}]}}
