He completed National Service with the Royal Air Force, then worked as a solicitor in Kenilworth, where he joined the Conservative Party and was elected to the local council.In 1971, Whittaker married his second wife, Lesley Hill.  The two founded their own solicitors' practice back in Coventry.  The following year, Lesley accessed a write up in Playboy of \"a candid conversation with the outspoken population biologist\" Dr. Paul Ehrlich.  Inspired by the content of this interview, Tony, Lesley, and their friends Michael Benfield and Freda Sanders, organised a meeting which founded PEOPLE.  Whittaker served as the party's chair, and was election agent for Lesley's candidacies in the February and October 1974 UK general elections.Within the party, Whittaker championed the idea of a basic income and zero growth, and was a vocal opponent of socialism.\nConcerned that people did not associate the party name with its ideals, Whittaker championed the party's renaming as the Ecology Party in 1975.  However, by this point, the couple felt that the party was unlikely to achieve its ideals.  They moved to Exmoor to pursue self-sufficiency and reduced their involvement.At the 1979 general election, Whittaker stood for the Ecology Party in North Devon, a seat held by former leader of the Liberal Party Jeremy Thorpe.  He took fourth place with 1.2% of the vote, and gained much publicity for the party.  The couple then decided to withdraw from the party, although Tony continued to attend many party conferences, and to support local party candidates.In later years, Whittaker became manager of the post office in Hennock, and spent his spare time sailing his yacht and developing computer programmes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political parties in the United Kingdom", "response": ["| Tony Whittaker"]}, {"page": "Green Party (UK)", "response": ["The Green Party's origins go back to the PEOPLE Party, founded in February 1972. An interview with overpopulation expert Paul R. Ehrlich in Playboy magazine inspired a small group of professional and business people to form the 'Club of Thirteen', so named because it first met on 13 October 1972 in Daventry. This included surveyors and property agents Freda Sanders and Michael Benfield, Jitendrakumar Patel (1950-2016) and husband-and-wife solicitors Lesley and Tony Whittaker (a former Kenilworth councillor for the Conservative Party), all with practices in Coventry. Many in this 'club' were wary of forming a political party; so, after a few weeks, in November 1972 these five agreed to form 'PEOPLE' as a new political party to challenge the UK political establishment. Its policy concerns published in 1973 included economics, employment, defence, energy and fuel supplies, land tenure, pollution and social security, all set within an ecological perspective. \"Zero growth\" (or \"steady state\") economics were a strong feature in the party's philosophical basis.", "Party co-founder Tony Whittaker noted in an interview with Derek Wall \"\u2026 voters did not connect PEOPLE with ecology.
