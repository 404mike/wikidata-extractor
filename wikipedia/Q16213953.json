Lilith (Natalie Celino), a sultry ornithologist appeares out of a bird hide by a noisy pair of friends hiking through the woods.  Gaining their confidence, she and one of the men, Travis (Scott North) go into the woods for a quick tryst, but immediately there is a blood curdling scream.

Near Travis, Lilith explains to Stanley that the shadows had come to life and attacked them, and the two set off to seek help. When they end up at Jacob's cabin, the entire group comes under attack by supernatural forces of darkness. Rachel discovers Irish cowboy Phelan (Jonnie Hurn) hanging out in their barn.  Phelan is a vampire and himself a former vampire hunter.  He tells Rachel that the real danger to everyone is Lilith, and explains how Lilith had been Adam's willful first wife who, since having been exiled from the Garden of Eden, had been spawning demonic offspring in the world of man. Considered the mother to the Succubi, ruler of shadows, slaughterer of children, and consort to the devil himself, she had been re-awakened by, and drawn to the location of, the occult power inherent in the mirror carried by Jacob. Phelan has been harboring a centuries-long grudge against her for she having \"turned\" him 120 years earlier, and he had been tracking her for decades, equipped with the one relic that might finally kill her... a bone splinter from the rib of Adam himself."]}, {"page": "Shed of the Dead", "response": ["Shed of the Dead is a 2019 British comedy horror film directed by Drew Cullingham and produced by Nicholas David Lean & James Fisher.", "Director Drew Cullingham first discussed ideas for the film during a visit to a pub with Nick Lean and producing partner James Fisher."]}]}}
