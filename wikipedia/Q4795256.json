Joseph Stone (born Silverstone) was born in Wales to a British Jewish family. Richard Stone's father was a medical practitioner and after relocating to Hampstead acted as the personal physician to Harold Wilson, the two-times Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for the Labour Party from 1964 to 1970 and again from 1974 to 1976. Other close family members of Richard Stone, influential in British society included his uncle Arnold Silverstone, Baron Ashdown, who was involved with the Conservative Party during the time that Edward Heath was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and another uncle Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein, who was Chairman of Granada Television, playing a major role in the development of commercial television and was a Labour Party life-peer. During the Second World War in 1945, he had produced the German Concentration Camps Factual Survey documentary, in association with the Psychological Warfare Division. Consequently, Stone is also related to Alexander Bernstein, Baron Bernstein of Craigweil, another Labour Party life-peer who was among the financiers of Michael Levy's Labour Leader's Office Fund during the New Labour-era while Tony Blair was British Prime Minister."]}]}}
