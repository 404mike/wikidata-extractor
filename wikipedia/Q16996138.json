Some of the illustrated constellations are now obsolete, as are some of the subconstellations, such as Caput Medus\u00e6 (the head of Medusa, carried by Perseus). Urania's Mirror was originally advertised as including \"all the constellations visible in the British Empire\", but, in fact, it left out some southern constellations. By the second edition (1825), advertisements merely claimed illustration of the constellations visible from \"Great Britain\". Some cards focus on a single constellation, others include several, with Card 32, centered on Hydra, illustrating twelve constellations (several of which are no longer recognised). Card 28 has six, and no other card has more than four. Each card measures 8 inches by  (about 20 by 14\u00a0cm). A book by Jehoshaphat Aspin entitled A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy  (or, to give its full name, A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy, Explaining the General Phenomena of the Celestial Bodies; with Numerous Graphical Illustrations) was written to accompany the cards. The cards and book came in a box illustrated with a woman almost certainly intended to be  Urania, muse of astronomy. The cards and book were originally published by Samuel Leigh, 18 Strand, London, p. 238 although, by the fourth edition, the publishing firm had moved to 421 Strand and changed its name to M. A.
