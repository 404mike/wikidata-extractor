His second marriage was the subject of much gossip as his wife eloped with his cousin Thomas Hervey  and lived openly with him for the rest of her days. He is, however, perhaps best remembered as being one of the early editors of the works of William Shakespeare. \nHe was identified with the Hanoverian Tory faction at the time of the Hanoverian Succession in 1714.", "link_mentions": {}}}
