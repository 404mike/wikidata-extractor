Foster had served as a Sergeant in the RAF during the war, and made himself very unpopular with the entertainments staff. Foster invited Peggy to grant him sexual favours, in return for which he would make her a Yellowcoat. When Gladys confronted Foster about this, he propositioned her in the same way, causing Spike to come to her rescue. When Spike challenged him, Foster punched him in the face, giving him a black eye. During his time at the camp, Foster was cruel and rude to every member of the staff, and sacked Peggy and Clive. He was recalled to head office and his decisions were reversed by Joe Maplin, after Sammy Morris called in a favour which Maplin owed him. He returned later in the season to inspect the staff, and sacked Ted after he asked for a pay rise. Foster then hired Jimmy Jasper as the new camp host, but was forced to reinstate Ted because Jasper's act was a disaster with the campers. Foster returned once again in the final episode to break the news to the staff that their services would not be required the following season, and presented them with a copy of Joe Maplin's autobiography, titled How I Done It."]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Mary Miller,Gwen Nelson,Ewan Hooper,Doreen Aris,Billy Russell,Brian Cant,Leslie Anderson,Jonathan Holt,Maryann Turner"]}, {"page": "Personal Services", "response": ["* Ewan Hooper as Edward"]}, {"page": "Royal Exchange, Manchester", "response": ["* Hindle Wakes by Stanley Houghton.
