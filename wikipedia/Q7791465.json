He was a book and picture dealer before entering politics. He was a founder member of Sinn F\u00e9in and was elected to Dublin City Council. Kelly was arrested after the 1916 Easter Rising and sent to prison in England, and after becoming seriously ill, he was released back to Dublin.\nHe was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in MP for the Dublin St Stephens's Green constituency at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.Kelly was unanimously elected as Lord Mayor of Dublin while being held in Wormwood Scrubs prison in England. Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to formally take up the position.He was re-elected unopposed at the 1921 elections for the Dublin South constituency. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty but was too ill to attend the D\u00e1il vote. He served as substitute Minister for Labour from 19 March 1919 to end of October 1919. He was again re-elected at the 1922 general election as a member of Pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in but did not take his seat in the D\u00e1il.\nHe did not join Cumann na nGaedheal along with other pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TDs in 1923, nor did he contest the 1923 general election. In 1930 he joined Fianna F\u00e1il and was elected as a Fianna F\u00e1il Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) at the 1933 general election for Dublin South. He remained a TD and councillor until his death in 1942.", "link_mentions": {}}}
