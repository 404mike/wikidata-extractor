He served as Member of Parliament for Oxford, Derby then West Monmouthshire and held the offices of Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under William Ewart Gladstone before becoming Leader of the Opposition. A talented speaker in parliament, he was sometimes regarded as aloof and possessing only an intellectual involvement in his causes. He failed to engender much emotional response in the public and became only a reluctant and disillusioned leader of his party.Historian Roy Jenkins says he was \"too much of a party man. In manner and by origin he was a patrician figure, but he saw most issues exclusively in terms of parliamentary infighting....His views were usually much more of a reaction to what his political enemies, in the other party and in his own, were saying then the result of any objective thought. He inspired considerable loyalty among his followers--the Great Gladiator he was sometimes enthusiastically called--but his colleagues, partly as a result of his execrable temperament and his bullying...found him a difficult man with whom to work.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
