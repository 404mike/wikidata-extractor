Self-trained, Stubbs learnt his skills independently from other great artists of the eighteenth century such as Reynolds or Gainsborough. Stubbs' output includes history paintings, but his greatest skill was in painting animals, perhaps influenced by his love and study of anatomy. His series of painting on the theme of a lion attacking a horse are early and significant examples of the Romantic movement that emerged in the late 18th century. His painting, Whistlejacket, hangs in the National Gallery, London.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 25", "response": ["*1724 \u2013 George Stubbs, English painter and academic (d. 1806)"]}, {"page": "Circe", "response": ["The subjects of later paintings impersonating Circe have a history of sexual experience behind them, starting with \"Mary Spencer in the character of Circe\" by William Caddick, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780.
