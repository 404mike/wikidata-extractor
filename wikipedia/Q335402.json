After taking part as a junior officer in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, Sir Ralph Abercromby's expedition to Egypt and then the War of the Third Coalition, he served as military secretary to Sir John Moore at the Battle of Corunna. He then commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 66th Regiment of Foot and, later, the 52nd Regiment of Foot at many of the battles of the Peninsular War. At the Battle of Waterloo, Colborne on his own initiative brought the 52nd Regiment of Foot forward, took up a flanking position in relation to the French Imperial Guard and then, after firing repeated volleys into their flank, charged at the Guard so driving them back in disorder.\nHe went on to become commander-in-chief of all the armed forces in British North America, personally leading the offensive at the Battle of Saint-Eustache in Lower Canada and defeating the rebel force in December 1837. After that he was high commissioner of the Ionian Islands and then Commander-in-Chief, Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1778", "response": ["** John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton of Great Britain (d. 1863)"]}, {"page": "Corfu", "response": ["* John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton (1778\u20131863) 1843\u20131849"]}, {"page": "List of governors general of Canada", "response": ["| John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton(1778\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "Family Compact", "response": ["The Colborne Clique, named for John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton, was a federation united by geography in Goderich, Ontario, Scottish heritage, time of immigration to Upper Canada, and an association with the Dunlop brothers William \"Tiger\" Dunlop and Robert Graham Dunlop.
