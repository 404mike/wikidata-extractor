The first, by William Dalton, was called Will Adams, The First Englishman in Japan: A Romantic Biography (London, 1861). Dalton had never been to Japan and his book reflects romanticised Victorian British notions of the exotic Asian. Richard Blaker's The Needlewatcher (London, 1932) is the least romantic of the novels; Blaker attempted to de-mythologize Adams and to write a careful historical work of fiction. James Scherer's Pilot and Sh\u014dgun is less a novel than a series of incidents in Adams' life. American Robert Lund wrote Daishi-san (New York, 1960) also tackles the subject. In Christopher Nicole's Lord of the Golden Fan, published just two years before Sh\u014dgun, in 1973, Adams is portrayed as sexually frustrated by the morals of his time and seeks freedom in the East, where he has numerous sexual encounters.
