It was at Kingstonian that he started his managerial career, at the age of 28, managing them for five months, before spending a year in charge of Enfield. In 1999, Westley became manager of Farnborough Town, guiding them to the Football Conference in 2002. He left Farnborough the following season, to become manager of Stevenage. He took the club to within one game of promotion to the Football League, but left the club in 2006 when his contract expired. Westley then had a brief spell with Rushden & Diamonds, as well as acting as caretaker manager at Kettering Town.\nHe took a year out of the game, before rejoining Stevenage in May 2008. He managed the club to FA Trophy success in 2009, before securing promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history in April 2010, finishing the season as league champions. The club won back-to-back promotions in his first season as a Football League manager, following Stevenage's successful 2010\u201311 League Two play-off campaign. At the start of 2012, Westley left Stevenage to join Preston North End. He was sacked by the club in February 2013. A month later, Westley rejoined Stevenage, his third spell at the club. He managed the club for another two years, before leaving again in May 2015. He took charge at Peterborough United four months later, before being sacked shortly before the end of the 2015\u201316 season. He was appointed manager at Newport County in October 2016, with the club lying bottom of the Football League, and was sacked five months later.
