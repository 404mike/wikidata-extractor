Some of her work focuses on fraught relationships between men and women, together with an exploration of gender politics, notably News from the Front (1983), co-authored with the poet and novelist D. M. Thomas, in which each poet explores the conflictive relationship between a young Portuguese radical and a right-wing British businessman, with each sometimes adopting the feminine and sometimes the masculine persona.
