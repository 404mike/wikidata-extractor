In 2006, an Irish government committee inquiry found that there was widespread collusion between British security forces and loyalist terrorists in the 1970s, which resulted in eighteen deaths.  In 2012, a document based review by Sir Desmond de Silva QC into the 1989 murder of Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane found that MI5 had colluded with the Ulster Defence Association (UDA).  The review disclosed that MI5 assessments of UDA intelligence consistently noted that the majority came from MI5 sources, with an assessment in 1985 finding 85% came from MI5.  Prime Minister David Cameron accepted the findings, and apologised on behalf of the British government, and acknowledged significant levels of collusion with Loyalists in its state agencies."]}, {"page": "Royal Order of Francis I", "response": ["* Desmond de Silva (barrister)"]}, {"page": "Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)", "response": ["In 1945, with the end of the monarchy, the order was in effect exiled, but it was revived in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a decoration with a War Merit Division.Zakon o osnovnim pravima lica odlikovanih Ordenom Kara\u0111or\u0111eve zvezde s ma\u010devima, Ordenom Belog orla s ma\u010devima i Zlatnom medaljom Obili\u0107a (\"Slu\u017ebeni list SFRJ\", br. 67/72, 22/73, 33/76, 39/77 (Pre\u010di\u0161\u0107eni tekst), 53/82, 75/85, 87/89).
