Commentators have noted that it is too large to be an actual ermine, but its size is explained by its being of a largely symbolic nature.

There are several interpretations of the ermine's significance and they are often used in combination with each other.

The light dilates the pupils of both eyes, but the proper right far more than the left, something that is not possible. Some have argued that this is simply for dramatic effect, so that the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.

Christie's has stated that it was probably commissioned around 1500, shortly after Louis conquered the Duchy of Milan and took control of Genoa in the Second Italian War; Leonardo himself moved from Milan to Florence in 1500.
