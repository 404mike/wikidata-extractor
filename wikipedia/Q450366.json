The first college for women at the University of Cambridge, Girton, opened in 1873. However, women were only allowed to take exams; it was not until 1948 that they were able to receive degrees.  They were marked and scored separately, however, and the results of female candidates were enunciated in comparison to men's, for instance, \"between the 20th and 21st Optimes.\" Exam results from the 1860s onward suggested that women broadly did as well as men, though with the notable exception of mathematics. At that time, it was commonly thought that women were emotional creatures lacking the mental faculty to master mathematics. Thus it was big news when Philippa Fawcett was ranked \"above the Senior Wranger\" in 1890, scoring thirteen percent higher than the top male that year, Geoffrey Thomas Bennett. She was the first, and last, woman to score the highest on the Tripos."]}, {"page": "Millicent Fawcett", "response": ["John Stuart Mill introduced Millicent to many other women's rights activists, including Henry Fawcett, a Liberal Member of Parliament who had intended to marry her sister Elizabeth before she decided to focus on her medical career. Millicent and Henry married on 23 April 1867. Henry had been blinded in a shooting accident in 1858 and Millicent acted as his secretary. Their marriage was said to be based on \"perfect intellectual sympathy\"; Millicent pursued a writing career while caring for Henry, and ran two households, one in Cambridge, one in London. The family had some radical beliefs in support of proportional representation, individualistic and free trade principles, and opportunities for women. Their only child was Philippa Fawcett, born in 1868, who was much encouraged by her mother in her studies. In 1890 Philippa became the first woman to obtain top score in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams.Caroline Series, \"And what became of the women?\", Mathematical Spectrum, Vol. 30 (1997/1998), pp. 49\u201352."]}, {"page": "1890 in science", "response": ["* Philippa Fawcett is placed above the Senior Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge in England."]}, {"page": "1868 in science", "response": ["** Philippa Fawcett (died 1948), English mathematician."]}, {"page": "Newnham College, Cambridge", "response": ["Many young women in mid-19th century England had no access to the kind of formal secondary schooling which would have enabled them to go straight into the same university courses as the young men \u2013 the first principal herself had never been a pupil in a school.

Some of them, with an extra year's preparation, did indeed go on to degree-level work.
