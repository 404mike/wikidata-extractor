According to an often-repeated myth, Gilbert and Sullivan did not change the name to Iolanthe until just before the premi\u00e8re.Baily 1952, p. 209 In fact, however, the title was advertised as Iolanthe as early as 13 November 1882 \u2013 eleven days before the opening \u2013 so the cast had at least that much time to learn the name. It is also clear that Sullivan's musical setting was written to match the cadence of the word \"Iolanthe,\" and could only accommodate the word \"Perola\" by preceding it (awkwardly) with \"O\", \"Come\" or \"Ah\".Tillett, et al. 1982, pp. 6\u20137 Henry Irving had produced a W. G.

In 1873, at the Strand Theatre, he appeared as Doricourt in the comedy The Belle's Stratagem, which was a long-running success. He then returned to Drury Lane, playing in such roles as Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, and was popular as Captain Molyneux in Dion Boucicault's The Shaughraun, among others. He continued to play in various London theatres in the mid-1870s such roles as Julian Peveril in a successful adaptation of Peveril of the Peak and the title role in the stage adaptation of Nicholas Nickleby at the Adelphi Theatre. In 1878 he had a hit as Squire Thornhill in Olivia, an adaptation by W. G. Wills of The Vicar of Wakefield, alongside Ellen Terry and Hermann Vezin.

Many authors effectively merge Morgan with Morgause (traditionally a sister of Morgan and the mother of Mordred from an incestuous union with their brother Arthur) and combine her with the less savory aspects of the Lady of the Lake (this is further positioning a modern Morgan as a nemesis for Merlin, who has never been truly her foe in the medieval Arthurian lore). Such a composite character is then often turned into Mordred's mother or partner.
