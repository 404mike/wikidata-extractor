The next botanist to notice puriri, Allan Cunningham, did not do so until 1826 when he observed it on \"the rocky shores of Bay of Islands, growing frequently within the range of salt water.\" Cunningham named it Vitex littoralis, correctly assigning it to the genus Vitex but overlooking that \"littoralis\" had been used for a Malayan species 4 years earlier. Thomas Kirk proposed V. lucens in 1897 after attention had been drawn to the fact that V. littoralis was taken.A.C.
