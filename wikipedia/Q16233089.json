The first leg took place at Newport's home ground, Rodney Parade, on 9 May 2019. Mansfield took the lead early in the first half following combined play from Jacob Mellis and Danny Rose which allowed CJ Hamilton to strike the ball into the roof of Newport's net at the near post.  Despite Mansfield's first-half dominance, Newport applied pressure in the second half, with a 70th minute strike from Robbie Willmott being disallowed for offside. Mansfield goalkeeper Conrad Logan had made a number of second-half saves before bringing down Adebayo Azeez and conceding a penalty late in the game.  Azeez's strike was saved by Logan before P\u00e1draig Amond converted the rebound, and the game ended 1\u20131.  The second leg of the semi-final was played three days later at Field Mill in Mansfield.  Newport dominated the first half, striking the Mansfield crossbar twice, but failed to convert any of their chances as it ended goalless.  The second half was a more even competition but saves from both goalkeepers ensured the match ended 0\u20130 in regular time, forcing the tie into extra time.  The Newport goalkeeper Joe Day saved a Tyler Walker shot while Regan Poole blocked Rose's shot on the line.  With no goals in extra time, the tie went to a penalty shootout.
