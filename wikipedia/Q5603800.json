While the quotes could be found in the gift store and in the Tate\u2019s cafe, the artists nevertheless licensed the quotes for use. The artists, within the institutional corporate boundaries of the Tate, incorporate Carpenter\u2019s quotes under the guise of \u201cReena Spaulings\u201d. Spaulings, being an alter-ego, is faced with a disruption of artistic integrity due to appropriation. Merlin Carpenter viewed the appropriation as an attack against their work, thus, proving the ego to be a flexible and sometimes controversial guise of artistic integrity regarding commercial institution. Merlin Carpenter, in turn, installed a caf\u00e9 within the gallery of the Tate to comment on incorporating their work within the Tate's corporate spaces. Quotes could be read in the caf\u00e9, including \"You put my work in the Tate's caf\u00e9, so I'll put the Tate caf\u00e9 in your art gallery.\""]}]}}
