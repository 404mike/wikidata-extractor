Jonze produced and provided his voice to a character in the short film Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life (2010), based on Maurice Sendak's book of the same name. He co-directed the video for LCD Soundsystem's \"Drunk Girls\" with the band's frontman James Murphy and directed the video for Arcade Fire's \"The Suburbs\" in 2010, the latter being an edited version of Jonze's short film Scenes from the Suburbs (2011), a dystopian vision of suburbia in the near-future and an expansion of the themes of nostalgia, alienation, and childhood found in the song. A third Jackass film, Jackass 3D, premiered in 2010. He was part of the main cast for the black comedy series The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret as the supervisor to David Cross' character for the first two seasons in 2010 and 2012, before being replaced by Jack McBrayer in the third season. Jonze resumed his longtime collaboration with the Beastie Boys in July 2011, directing the video for their song featuring Santigold, \"Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win\", in which the band members are portrayed as action figures. He then directed the video for Kanye West and Jay-Z's 2011 single \"Otis\", which saw the pair driving a customized Maybach 57 around an industrial lot. Along with Simon Cahn, Jonze co-directed the stop-motion animated short film Mourir Aupr\u00e8s De Toi (2011), which is set in the Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris.
