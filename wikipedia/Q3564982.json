He was due to play in an England 'A' game when he was unexpectedly summoned to Twickenham to replace the injured Wade Dooley. With only a 20-minute line-out session with his new teammates before the game, Johnson was thrown into the deep end. An early clash of heads with French prop Laurent Seigne left Johnson concussed, but he continued to play as England won 16\u201315. Johnson did not feature again for England in the Five Nations that season but was called up for an uncapped tour to Canada.  After featuring in England's loss to Canada he was called up, again as a replacement for Dooley, for the 1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand.  Dooley had returned to England for his father's funeral and was blocked from returning to the tour by the Lions' own committee.

England, who had not won in Cardiff since 1963, led the game 15\u201312, before fullback Chris Martin failed to take a high kick and Davies (Jonathan) scored a crucial try.

On that day Hadley eclipsed his English counterparts Wade Dooley and Martin Bayfield, and rallied an understrength Canadian side to a respectable outcome. Many however point to Canada's narrow quarter-final defeat to the New Zealand All Blacks in the 1991 World Cup as Canada's finest hour, where Hadley and a big, tough forward pack clearly had the upper hand over New Zealand. That highly regarded 1991 Canadian team made a big impact defeating Fiji and Romania and giving both France and New Zealand difficult games.  Always outspoken, a dispute with national team management saw him not play the 1995 World Cup, where his team desperately needed him in a tough pool that included South Africa and Australia."]}, {"page": "1993 British Lions tour to New Zealand", "response": ["|Wade Dooley||Preston Grasshoppers||||", "|Martin Johnson||Leicester||||Replacement for Wade Dooley"]}, {"page": "1989 British Lions tour to Australia", "response": ["|Wade Dooley"]}, {"page": "Preston Grasshoppers R.F.C.", "response": ["Grasshoppers' players who have progressed to bigger stages include A.N.
