In an interview in the 1990s describing Epstein's involvement in the band's rise to fame, Martin declared, \"He's the fifth Beatle, if there ever was one.\"", "thumb|left|275px|George Martin (second-right) working with the Beatles", "===George Martin===", "George Martin produced nearly all of the Beatles' recordings (except for the Let It Be album, produced by Phil Spector, and the songs \"Real Love\" and \"Free as a Bird\", produced by Jeff Lynne) and wrote the instrumental score for the Yellow Submarine film and soundtrack album, and the string and horn (and even some vocal) arrangements for almost all of their songs (with the famous exception of Spector's re-production on Let It Be, and \"She's Leaving Home\", which was arranged by Mike Leander). His arrangement of the string octet backing for \"Eleanor Rigby\" was widely noted.", "Lennon disparaged Martin's importance to the Beatles' music. In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, Lennon said, \"[Dick James is] another one of those people, who think they made us. They didn't. I\u2019d like to hear Dick James' music and I'd like to hear George Martin's music, please, just play me some.\" In a 1971 letter to Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, \"When people ask me questions about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only one answer, 'What does he do now?' I noticed you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth.\"  Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music.  Commenting specifically on \"Revolution 9\", Lennon said, \"For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask any of the other people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone.\"  In a tribute to Martin after his death, McCartney said \"If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle, it was George. From the day that he gave The Beatles our first recording contract, to the last time I saw him, he was the most generous, intelligent and musical person I've ever had the pleasure to know.\" Julian Lennon called him \"The Fifth Beatle, without question\".", "Andy White played drums on the US pressing of \"Love Me Do\", which was the Beatles' first single in the United States. Ron Richards, assistant producer to George Martin, was in charge of recording on 11 September 1962.  In June, the band had recorded \"Love Me Do\" with Best, then a second time in early September with brand new (three weeks) member Starr, before deciding to record it a third time.  Richards brought experienced session drummer White in for drums on this recording, with Starr playing tambourine.  White and Starr also both played percussion on \"P.S. I Love You\" during this session, with White on drums and Starr on maracas.", "* \"A Song-by-Song Look at What Made George Martin the Fifth Beatle\" (The New York Times; March 15, 2016)."]}, {"page": "Atlantic Records", "response": ["Recording engineer and producer Tom Dowd played a crucial role in Atlantic's success. He initially worked for Atlantic on a freelance basis, but within a few years he had been hired as the label's full-time staff engineer. His recordings for Atlantic and Stax influenced pop music. He had more hits than George Martin and Phil Spector combined."]}, {"page": "Mellotron", "response": ["Mike Pinder worked at Streetly Electronics for 18 months in the early 1960s as a tester, and was immediately excited by the possibilities of the instrument. After trying piano and Hammond organ, he settled on the Mellotron as the instrument of choice for his band, the Moody Blues, purchasing a second-hand model from Fort Dunlop Working Men's Club in Birmingham and using it extensively on every album from Days of Future Passed (1967) to Octave (1978). Pinder says he introduced John Lennon and Paul McCartney to the Mellotron, and convinced each of them to buy one. The Beatles hired a machine and used it on their single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", recorded in various takes between November and December 1966. Author Mark Cunningham describes the part in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" as \"probably the most famous Mellotron figure of all-time\". Though producer George Martin was unconvinced by the instrument, describing it \"as if a Neanderthal piano had impregnated a primitive electronic keyboard\", they continued to compose and record with various Mellotrons for the albums Magical Mystery Tour (1967) and The Beatles (1968, also known as \"the White Album\"). McCartney went on to use the Mellotron sporadically in his solo career."]}, {"page": "Post-rock", "response": ["Earlier uses of the term include its employment in a 1975 article by American journalist James Wolcott about musician Todd Rundgren, although with a different meaning. It was also used in the Rolling Stone Album Guide to name a style roughly corresponding to \"avant-rock\" or \"out-rock\". The earliest use of the term cited by Reynolds dates back as far as September 1967. In a Time cover story feature on the Beatles, writer Christopher Porterfield hails the band and producer George Martin's creative use of the recording studio, declaring that this is \"leading an evolution in which the best of current post-rock sounds are becoming something that pop music has never been before: an art form.\" Another pre-1994 example of the term in use can be found in an April 1992 review of 1990s noise-pop band The Earthmen by Steven Walker in Melbourne music publication Juke, where he describes a \"post-rock noisefest\"."]}, {"page": "Sgt.

A key work of British psychedelia, it incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. The band continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, the group coloured much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" and \"A Day in the Life\". Recording was completed on 21 April. The cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures, was designed by the pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth.", "On the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. George Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way and holidayed in Kenya with Mal Evans, one of the Beatles' tour managers. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono.

The album topped Record Retailers LP chart for 30 weeks, an unprecedented achievement for a pop album at that time.", "Nationwide interest in the Beatles had been piqued with the success of their second UK single and Parlophone, hoping to take advantage of this, promptly decided to follow it up with an album. Consequently, their record producer, George Martin, urgently needed ten more tracks if he was to include the four sides (\"Love Me Do\" / \"P.S. I Love You\" and \"Please Please Me\" / \"Ask Me Why\") of the group's first two singles: \"I asked them what they had which we could record quickly, and the answer was their stage act,\" Martin said (the norm for British 12\" vinyl pop albums in 1963 was to have seven songs on each side whereas American albums usually had five or six songs per side). Martin considered recording live at The Cavern Club, but on deciding the venue was unsuitable for live recording purposes, a session was booked at EMI Studios in London. Martin said, \"It was a straightforward performance of their stage repertoire \u2013 a broadcast, more or less.\" Initially, a morning and afternoon session only were booked; the evening session was added later.", "George Martin was an honorary fellow of the Zoological Society of London, which owns London Zoo and he thought that it might be good publicity for the zoo to have the Beatles pose outside the insect house for the cover photography of the album. However, the society turned down Martin's request, and instead, Angus McBean was asked to take the distinctive colour photograph of the group looking down over the stairwell inside EMI's London headquarters in Manchester Square. Martin was to write later: \"We rang up the legendary theatre photographer Angus McBean, and bingo, he came round and did it there and then. It was done in an almighty rush, like the music. Thereafter, though, the Beatles' own creativity came bursting to the fore.\" In 1969, the Beatles asked McBean to recreate this shot. Although the 1969 photograph was originally intended for the then-planned Get Back album, it was not used when that project saw eventual release in 1970 as Let It Be. Instead, the 1969 photograph, along with an unused photograph from the 1963 photo shoot, was used in 1973 for the Beatles' retrospective albums 1962\u20131966 and 1967\u20131970.

The shift from the experimental nature of the late 50s dramas to theme tunes was noticeable enough for one radio presenter to have to remind listeners that the purpose of the Workshop was not pop music. In fact, in 1962 one of Fagandini's interval signals \"Time Beat\" was reworked with assistance from George Martin (in his pre-Beatles days) and commercially released as a single using the pseudonym Ray Cathode. During this early period the innovative electronic approaches to music in the Workshop began to attract some significant young talent including Delia Derbyshire, Brian Hodgson and John Baker, who was in fact a jazz pianist with an interest in reverse tape effects.

The cover photograph was taken by the fashion photographer Robert Freeman and has since been mimicked by several music groups over the years. A different cover was used for the Australian release of the album, which the Beatles were displeased with.", "Impressed with Robert Freeman's black-and-white pictures of John Coltrane, Brian Epstein invited the photographer to create the cover image. George Harrison later said that, whereas the cover of Please Please Me had been \"crap\", their second LP was \"the beginning of us being actively involved in The Beatles' artwork ... the first one where we thought, 'Hey, let's get artistic.'\" The group asked Freeman to take inspiration from pictures their friend Astrid Kirchherr had taken in Hamburg between 1960 and 1962, featuring the band members in half-shadow and not smiling. To achieve this result, on 22 August 1963, Freeman photographed them in a dark corridor of the Palace Court Hotel in Bournemouth, where the band were playing a summer residency at the local Gaumont Cinema. To fit the square format of the cover, he put Ringo Starr in the bottom right corner, \"since he was the last to join the group. He was also the shortest\". Paul McCartney described the result as \"very moody\", adding: \"people think he must have worked at [it] forever and ever. But it was an hour. He sat down, took a couple of rolls, and he had it.\" The original concept was to paint the picture from edge to edge, with no bleeding, title or artist credit \u2013 a concept that went against music industry practice and was immediately vetoed by EMI. The first album to carry an edge-to-edge cover was the Rolling Stones' self-titled debut, released five months later. EMI also objected to the fact that the Beatles were not smiling; it was only after George Martin intervened, as head of Parlophone, that the cover portrait was approved.
