He played as a central defender for Partick Thistle, for the successful Liverpool team of the late 1970s and 1980s, and for the Scotland national football team. As a football pundit, Hansen became known for his outspoken views, particularly on teams' defensive performances, frequently criticising what he believed was \"diabolical\" or \"shocking\" defending. He co-hosted Match of the Day from 1992 to 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Beckham", "response": ["United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\"), which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. When experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis left the club after the end of the 1994\u201395 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including Darren Anderton, Marc Overmars and Roberto Baggio, but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3\u20131 defeat at Aston Villa,The most famous comment was Alan Hansen's \"You can't win anything with kids\", quoted in The Boss 405. Beckham scored United's goal (his first for them in the league) from a distance of around 30\u00a0metres. with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game.

Lineker's first game for Everton happened to be away to Leicester City; at half time, he walked into the Leicester dressing room by mistake. He was again the First Division's leading goal scorer, this time with 30 goals (including three hat-tricks), and helped Everton finish second in the league. While at Everton, they reached the FA Cup final for the third consecutive year but lost 3\u20131 to Liverpool, despite Lineker giving them an early lead when he outpaced Alan Hansen to score. Liverpool had also pipped Everton to the title by just two points. \"I was only on Merseyside a short time, nine or 10 months in total really, but it was still a happy time personally, while professionally it was one of the most successful periods of my career\", he says. \"I still have an affinity towards Everton.\""]}, {"page": "June 13", "response": ["*1955 \u2013 Alan Hansen, Scottish footballer and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.", "response": ["| Alan Hansen || 1985\u20131988", "| Alan Hansen || 1989\u20131990"]}, {"page": "Alex Ferguson", "response": ["A youthful United team lost 3\u20131 in their opening league game of the 1995\u201396 season, against Aston Villa. On Match of the Day, pundit Alan Hansen criticised their performance, ending his analysis with the words, \"You can't win anything with kids.\" United won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of Cantona, who made his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995. For much of the season, the team trailed league leaders Newcastle and found themselves ten points behind by Christmas; this later was narrowed to seven points after defeating them on 27 December 1995. The gap increased to 12 points, but a series of wins, coupled with Newcastle dropping points, meant by late March, United moved to the top of the table.  In a televised outburst after his team's win against Leeds, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan responded angrily to Ferguson's comments: \"We're still fighting for this title, and he's got to go to Middlesbrough\u00a0... I would love it if we beat them, love it.\" A win against Middlesbrough on the final day sealed the title for United and the team beat Liverpool by a goal to nil to win the 1996 FA Cup Final; this was their second double in three years.

With Edwin van der Sar, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes all retiring in 2011, Ferguson spent big by signing defender Phil Jones from Blackburn and winger Ashley Young from Aston Villa for around \u00a317\u00a0million each, and goalkeeper David de Gea from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for around \u00a319\u00a0million."]}, {"page": "Hillsborough disaster", "response": ["In 1999, Anfield was packed with a crowd of around 10,000 people ten years after the disaster.

According to Stephen Kelly, hiring Twentyman as chief scout was \"perhaps Shankly's finest signing ever\".Kelly, p. 244. It was through Twentyman that Liverpool found the new players and, after Shankly retired, Twentyman gave sterling service to Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan by finding players including Phil Neal, Alan Hansen and Ian Rush.Kelly, pp. 245\u2013246. As always, Shankly kept things simple and Twentyman was told to look for a prospect's basic qualities which were the abilities to pass the ball and move into position to receive a pass.Hughes, p. 17. Shankly also wanted Twentyman to check the player's personality and ensure he had the right attitude for a professional footballer. Above all, said Twentyman, \"he wanted to know if the lad had the heart to play for Liverpool\". Although Shankly sometimes paid large transfer fees he was loath to do so and Twentyman's brief was to find young players so he (Shankly) could mould them into what he wanted.Hughes, p. 44."]}]}}
