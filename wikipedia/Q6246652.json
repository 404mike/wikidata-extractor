An NCO was wounded and a medical officer who went to his aid was also wounded. Second Lieutenant Craig went out at once and got the NCO under cover, but while taking the medical officer to shelter was himself wounded. Nevertheless, the rescue was effected, and he then scooped cover for the wounded, thus saving their lives.Craig served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scottish Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["*John Manson Craig \u2013 1917; Egypt"]}, {"page": "Royal Scots Fusiliers", "response": ["*Second Lieutenant John Manson Craig, First World War (5 June 1917)"]}, {"page": "John Craig", "response": ["*John Manson Craig (1896\u20131970), Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Craig (surname)", "response": ["*John Manson Craig (1896\u20131970), Scottish soldier"]}, {"page": "155th (South Scottish) Brigade", "response": ["* 2nd Lieutenant John Manson Craig, 1/4th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers, First World War"]}]}}
