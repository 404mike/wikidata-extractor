Ashamed of his family and background, Ken was constantly apologising to her. This frustrated Susan, who actually liked Coronation Street.Roache 2010, p.117. Fifty years later, it transpired that their relationship had left Susan pregnant, resulting in the birth of a son, Lawrence. After Susan, Ken's early love interests included Marian Lund (Patricia Heneghan), a librarian eleven years his senior; Yvonne Chappell (Alex Marshall), a hotel receptionist he met en route to first wife Valerie's funeral; Norma Ford (Diana Davies), an impressionable young shop-assistant; Wendy Nightingale (Susan Tebbs), a married woman who moved in with Ken, making them Coronation Streets first unmarried cohabiting couple;Egan 2010, pp.138\u2013139. and Elaine.Roache 2010, pp.118\u2013122. Roache believes that Ken was in love with Elaine, though her feelings for him were less intense. He recalls some discussion of re-introducing her to the series in 2009; however, this did not come to fruition.Roache 2010, p.121. Upon separating from Elaine, Ken confided in his friend Rita (Knox) that, \"There were other fellers more glamorous, more successful, more wealthy and more interesting than me.\" According to Roache, the line offers insight into Ken's psyche, evidencing that he truly belongs on Coronation Street, despite his desires to the contrary.Roache 2010, p.122."]}, {"page": "Rita Sullivan", "response": ["Len is appointed Deputy Mayor.
