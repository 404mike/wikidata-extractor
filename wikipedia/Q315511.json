(Document made available by Columbia University Libraries. PDF downloads automatically.) Use of the word lesbianism to describe erotic relationships between women had been documented in 1870.Zimmerman, pp. 776\u2013777. In 1890, the term lesbian was used in a medical dictionary as an adjective to describe tribadism (as \"lesbian love\"). The terms lesbian, invert and homosexual were interchangeable with sapphist and sapphism around the turn of the 20th century. The use of lesbian in medical literature became prominent; by 1925, the word was recorded as a noun to mean the female equivalent of a sodomite.\"Lesbian\", Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, 1989.

In the early seventeenth century, John Donne wrote \"Sapho to Philaenis\", returning to the idea of Sappho as a hypersexual lover of women. The modern debate on Sappho's sexuality began in the 19th century, with Welcker publishing, in 1816, an article defending Sappho from charges of prostitution and lesbianism, arguing that she was chaste \u2013 a position which would later be taken up by Wilamowitz at the end of the 19th and Henry Thornton Wharton at the beginning of the 20th centuries. In the nineteenth century Sappho was co-opted by the Decadent Movement as a lesbian \"daughter of de Sade\", by Charles Baudelaire in France and later Algernon Charles Swinburne in England. By the late 19th century, lesbian writers such as Michael Field and Amy Levy became interested in Sappho for her sexuality, and by the turn of the twentieth century she was a sort of \"patron saint of lesbians\"."]}, {"page": "Sestina", "response": ["In the 1870s, there was a revival of interest in French forms, led by Andrew Lang, Austin Dobson, Edmund Gosse, W. E. Henley, John Payne, and others.White 1887 p xxxix The earliest sestina of this period is Algernon Charles Swinburne's \"Sestina\".This is the earliest-published sestina reprinted by Gleeson White (White 1887 pp\u00a0203\u201312), and he doesn't mention any earlier ones. It is in iambic pentameter rhyming ABABAB in the first stanza; each stanza begins by repeating the previous end-words 6 then 1, but the following 4 lines repeat the remaining end-words ad lib; the envoi is (1) 4 / (2) 3 / (5) 6. In the same volume (Poems and Ballads, Second Series, 1878) Swinburne introduces a \"double sestina\"Lennard 2006 p. 53 (\"The Complaint of Lisa\") that is unlike Sidney's: it comprises 12 stanzas of 12 iambic pentameter lines each, the first stanza rhyming ABCABDCEFEDF. Similar to his \"Sestina\", each stanza first repeats end-words 12 then 1 of the previous stanza; the rest are ad lib. The envoi is (12) 10 / (8) 9 / (7) 4 / (3) 6 / (2) 1 / (11) 5.", "The sestina has been subject to some variations, with changes being made to both the size and number of stanzas, and also to individual line length. A \"double sestina\" is the name given to either: two sets of six six-line stanzas, with a three-line envoy (for a total of 75 lines), or twelve twelve-line stanzas, with a six-line envoy (for a total of 150 lines). Examples of either variation are rare; \"Ye Goatherd Gods\" by Philip Sidney is a notable example of the former variation, while \"The Complaint of Lisa\" by Algernon Charles Swinburne is a notable example of the latter variation. In the former variation, the original pattern of line-ending words, i.e. that of the first stanza, recurs in the seventh stanza, and thus the entire change of pattern occurs twice throughout. In the second variation, the pattern of line-ending words returns to the starting sequence in the eleventh stanza; thus it does not, unlike the \"single\" sestina, allow for every end-word to occupy each of the stanza ends; end-words 5 and 10 fail to couple between stanzas."]}, {"page": "Thomas Bowdler", "response": ["The Bowdlers were not the first to undertake such a project, but Bowdler's commitment not to augment or add to Shakespeare's text, merely remove sensitive material, contrasted with earlier practice. Nahum Tate as Poet Laureate had rewritten the tragedy of King Lear with a happy ending; in 1807, Charles Lamb and Mary Lamb published Tales from Shakespeare for children with synopses of 20 of the plays, but seldom quoted the original text. Though The Family Shakespeare was seen as a negative example of censorship by the literary establishment and its commitment to \"authentic\" Shakespeare, the Bowdler editions made it more acceptable to teach Shakespeare to wider and younger audiences. According to the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, \"More nauseous and more foolish cant was never chattered than that which would deride the memory or depreciate the merits of Bowdler.
