He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford.  He was a Major in the Royal North Gloucestershire Militia and a J.P. for Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire.In March 1878 Chester-Master was elected at a by-election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Cirencester. He held the seat until the parliamentary borough was abolished at the 1885 general election.  Chester-Master did not stand for Parliament again until the 1892 general election, when he contested the new Cirencester division of Gloucestershire. He tied in votes with Harry Lawson Webster Lawson but lost in the run-off by-election in 1893.Chester-Master died at the age of 73.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Thomas Chester-Master (1841\u20131914), Conservative MP for Cirencester (1878\u20131885; 1892\u20131893)Harrow, 1800\u20131911, p. 279"]}, {"page": "Cirencester (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["However, the name was transferred to the county constituency in which the town was placed, formally called The Eastern (or Cirencester) Division of Gloucestershire. This was a substantially-sized constituency fairly similar in its boundaries to the modern Cotswold District Council, with a strong rural element but including a number of small towns apart from Cirencester - Chipping Campden, Fairford, Moreton-in-Marsh, Tetbury and Stow-on-the-Wold among them. In character it proved more Liberal than Cirencester borough had done, though this may have been as much from the dilution of the Bathurst influence as from political factors - consequently instead of being a safe Conservative seat it was generally a knife-edge marginal. Arthur Winterbotham, the Liberal who had won the constituency by 700 votes at its first election, in 1885, was re-elected unopposed when he became a Liberal Unionist in 1886, but when he switched back to the Liberals at the next general election his majority fell to 153. Winterbotham died later the same year, and the by-election was decided in favour of the Conservative candidate, Colonel Thomas Chester-Master, by just 3 votes; but his defeated opponent petitioned against the result and after further scrutiny of the ballots the result was revised and declared to be tied. It was impossible at this stage to give a casting vote to the returning officer (the usual solution to a tied election at that period), so the election had to be run again.", "|rowspan=\"2\"| Thomas Chester-Master I", "| Thomas Chester-Master II", "| Thomas Chester-Master "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Chester-Master"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|Thomas Chester-Master", "|Thomas Chester-Master"]}, {"page": "Thomas Chester-Master", "response": ["Thomas Chester-Master may refer to:", "* Thomas Chester-Master (1815\u20131899), Member of Parliament (MP) for Cirencester 1837\u20131844", "* Thomas Chester-Master (1841\u20131914), MP for Cirencester 1878\u20131885, 1892\u20131893"]}, {"page": "Thomas Chester-Master (1841-1914)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Chester-Master (1841\u20131914) "]}, {"page": "John Etherington Welch Rolls", "response": ["Rolls' daughters, Elizabeth Harcourt, Patty, Anne Katherine and Ellen, all married well; Georgina Emily married Thomas Chester-Master who was a Conservative MPDebretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1881 whilst Rolls' third daughter Mary Octavia Rolls did not marry."]}, {"page": "List of UK Parliamentary election petitions", "response": ["| 13 October 1892 || Cirencester || Harry Lawson Webster Lawson || Colonel Thomas Chester-Master || Recount with scrutiny || Void election || The original result had been a majority of 2 for Chester-Master.
