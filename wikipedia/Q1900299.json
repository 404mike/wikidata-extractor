He turned professional in 1985 but opted for a career as a club professional rather than attempting a touring career, due to his desire to stay close to his young family. His club career culminated in a position as senior professional at Kedleston Park Golf Club in Derbyshire, where he succeeded former European Tour player David J. Russell. During this stage of his career, Wesselingh won the European Club Professionals Championship, played three times in The Open Championship and played on three GB&I teams against the USA in the PGA Cup.Upon turning 50 in 2011, Wesselingh opted to play on the European Senior Tour, coming through the qualifying school at the end of that year. He was runner-up in his first tournament, and claimed his first win three events later at the ISPS Handa PGA Seniors Championship. Wesselingh defended the ISPS Handa PGA Seniors Championship in 2013, winning by four strokes for his second win on the seniors tour. Victories as such lead to him receiving the Rookie of the Year in 2012. Following his early success on the European Seniors Tour, he continued making himself a strong contender in the years to follow. 2013 saw his most successful year to date, winning five tournaments including the tour championship event held at Belle Mare Plage resort in Mauritius, earning him the number one spot for the tours Order of Merit for the 2013 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Montgomerie", "response": ["| Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn,  Paul Wesselingh"]}, {"page": "Bernhard Langer", "response": ["| Philip Golding,  Paul Wesselingh"]}, {"page": "European Senior Tour", "response": ["|2013 || Paul Wesselingh ||  || align=right|311,644"]}, {"page": "Barry Lane", "response": ["| Paul Wesselingh"]}, {"page": "Philip Golding", "response": ["| Bernhard Langer,  Paul Wesselingh"]}, {"page": "Wales Seniors Open", "response": ["| 2015 || Paul Wesselingh ||  || Celtic Manor || align=center|203 || align=center|\u22127 || 2 strokes ||  Peter Fowler Ian Woosnam"]}, {"page": "PGA Seniors Championship", "response": ["| 2013 ||  Paul Wesselingh (2) || align=center|272 || align=center|\u221220 || 4 strokes ||  \u00c1ngel Franco || Mottram Hall || ", "| 2012 ||  Paul Wesselingh || align=center|210 || align=center|\u22126 || 1 stroke ||  Anders Forsbrand Andrew Oldcorn || Slaley Hall || "]}, {"page": "Swiss Seniors Open", "response": ["| 2013 ||  Paul Wesselingh || align=center|201 || align=center|\u22129 || Playoff ||  Kevin Spurgeon"]}, {"page": "Travis Perkins Masters", "response": ["| 2013 || Colin Montgomerie ||  || align=center|206 || align=center|\u221210 || 6 strokes ||  Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn Paul Wesselingh"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Paul Wesselingh||1961\u2013"]}, {"page": "2004 Open Championship", "response": [":Turnberry Kintyre \u2013 Lloyd Campbell (a), Steven Tiley (a), Paul Wesselingh, Sean Whiffin"]}, {"page": "2003 Open Championship", "response": [":Littlestone \u2013 Steven Bowditch, Robert Coles, Scott Godfrey (a), Adam Le Vesconte, Christopher Smith, Anthony Wall, Paul Wesselingh"]}, {"page": "Gary Wolstenholme", "response": ["| Mike Harwood,  Paul Wesselingh, Chris Williams"]}, {"page": "2012 European Senior Tour", "response": ["| Paul Wesselingh (1)", "|align=center|5 || Paul Wesselingh ||  || align=center|191,663"]}, {"page": "2013 in golf", "response": ["*European Senior Tour \u2013 England's Paul Wesselingh topped the Order of Merit for the first time with earnings of \u20ac311,644."]}, {"page": "2013 European Senior Tour", "response": ["The 2013 European Senior Tour was the 22nd season of the European Senior Tour, the professional golf tour for men aged 50 and above operated by the PGA European Tour.
