It was established as a protest against, and an alternative to, the perceived middle-class bias and assumptions of regular churches. Its aims were to help the schools in their teaching of socialism. A manual was prepared for the use of teachers. It contained sample lesson plans and teaching tips to help teachers, together with suggested readings for socialist education."]}, {"page": "Caroline Eliza Derecourt Martyn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Caroline Martyn"]}, {"page": "Carrie Martyn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Caroline Martyn"]}, {"page": "Jeannie Mole", "response": ["Mole was an early follower of dress reform, a feminist movement against the cumbersome garments of the Victorian era, and would regularly wear an outfit reminiscent of Greek robes.

He became interested in Georgism, and founded a local Democratic Club to promote the principle, then when he was twenty-seven, he heard a talk by Caroline Martyn which convinced him to become a socialist.  He joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and served for many years as president of its West Bromwich branch.  He proposed the formation of district councils and federations within the party.  This was approved, and by 1906, Brockhouse was president of the party's South Staffordshire Federation.  That year, he was elected to the ILP's National Administrative Committee, serving for three years as the representative of its Midlands Division.  From 1903, he also served as chair of the party's Divisional Council."]}]}}
