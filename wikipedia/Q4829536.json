Ritz eventually sold the station in a deal which saw the staff go unpaid to Mean Radio, part of Vince Power's Mean Fiddler group. It was in turn purchased by Asian radio tycoon Avtar Lit, owner of Sunrise Radio, who renamed it Easy 1035. After a year or so of broadcasting a mixed easy listening/country format, Mr Lit applied to Ofcom to transfer Easy to a digital platform, thus freeing the 1035 frequency for Kismat Radio, a further Asian-language station. \"Easy 1035\" stopped broadcasting on the analogue AM service in 2003 but continued broadcasting (now called Easy Radio London) via its digital frequency.
