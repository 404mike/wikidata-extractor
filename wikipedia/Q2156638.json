Before the outbreak of Civil War, he had served as a diplomatic representative, first in the North, and then replacing George Buckley-Mathew in Charleston, who was causing diplomatic problems. In particular, Mathew was vocally against South Carolina's recent rule of incarcerating British African sailors while in port.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trent Affair", "response": ["On May 18 Russell had instructed Lyons to seek Confederate agreement to abide by the Paris Declaration. Lyons assigned this task to Robert Bunch, the British consul in Charleston, South Carolina, who was directed to contact South Carolina Governor Francis Wilkinson Pickens. Bunch exceeded his instructions: he bypassed Pickens, and openly assured the Confederates that agreement to the Paris Declaration was \"the first step to [British] recognition\". His indiscretion soon came to Union ears. Robert Mure, a British-born Charleston merchant, was arrested in New York. Mure, a colonel in the South Carolina militia, had a British diplomatic passport issued by Bunch, and was carrying a British diplomatic pouch (which was searched). The pouch contained some actual correspondence from Bunch to Britain, and also pro-Confederate pamphlets, personal letters from Southerners to European correspondents, and a Confederate dispatch which recounted Bunch's dealings with the Confederacy, including the talk of recognition.Berwanger, pp. 39\u201351."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Venezuela", "response": ["* 1878\u20131881: Robert Bunch"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Colombia", "response": ["*1866\u20131873: Robert Bunch", "*1873\u20131878: Robert Bunch"]}, {"page": "Bunch, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Bunch"]}]}}
