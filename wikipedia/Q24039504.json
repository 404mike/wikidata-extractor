Time wrote in 1980: \"It is widely known that Ron's parents have not managed to see a single ballet performance of their son, who is clearly very good, having been selected to the Joffrey second company, and is their son nonetheless. Ron talks of his parents with much affection. But these absences are strange and go back a ways.\" Reagan and Nancy went to see Ron perform at the Lisner Auditorium on Monday, May 18, 1981.
