He suffered from rheumatism and sciatica ever afterwards. It nearly disabled him while laying the cable from Lowestoft to Norderney in Germany for Paul Reuter in 1866. This line was designed by Forde & Jenkin, manufactured by Messrs. W. T. Henley & Co., and laid by the Caroline and William Cory. Clara Volkman, a niece of Reuter, sent the first message, with the telegraph engineer C. F. Varley holding her hand."]}, {"page": "Homing pigeon", "response": ["In 1818, a great pigeon race called the Cannonball Run took place at Brussels. In 1860, Paul Reuter, who later founded Reuters press agency, used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminus of early telegraph lines. The outcome of the 1815 Battle of Waterloo has often been claimed to have been delivered to London by pigeon but there is no evidence for this, and it's very unlikely; the pigeon post was rare until the 1820s. During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between besieged Paris and the French unoccupied territory. In December 1870, it took ten hours for a pigeon carrying microfilms to fly from Perpignan to Brussels."]}, {"page": "James Gordon Bennett Jr.", "response": ["He did not marry until he was 73.

The text was jointly prepared by Paul Reuter, the legal adviser at the Foreign Ministry and his aide  and Jean Monnet and two of his team, Pierre Uri and \u00c9tienne Hirsch. The French government agreed to the Schuman Declaration, which invited the Germans and all other European countries to manage their coal and steel industries jointly and democratically in Europe's first supranational Community, with its five fundamental institutions. On 18 April 1951, six founder members signed the Treaty of Paris, which formed the basis of the European Coal and Steel Community. They declared that date and the corresponding democratic, supranational principles to be the 'real foundation of Europe'. Three communities have been created so far. The Treaties of Rome (1957) created the Economic Community and the nuclear non-proliferation Community, Euratom. Together with intergovernmental machinery of later treaties, they eventually evolved into the European Union. The Schuman Declaration was made on 9 May 1950 and since then, 9 May is designated to be Europe Day."]}, {"page": "1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat", "response": ["Throughout the 19th century, Iran was caught between two advancing imperial powers, Russia and Britain. In 1892, the British diplomat George Curzon described Iran as \"pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out a game for the dominion of the world.\" During the latter half of the 19th century, the concession policies of the monarchy faced increased opposition. In 1872, a representative of British entrepreneur Paul Reuter met with the Iranian monarch Naser al-Din Shah Qajar and agreed to fund the monarch's upcoming lavish visit to Europe in return for exclusive contracts for Iranian roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works, in which Reuter would receive a stipulated sum for five years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. However, the so-called \"Reuter concession\" was never put into effect because of violent opposition at home and from Russia. In 1892 the Shah was forced to revoke a tobacco monopoly given to Major G. F. Talbot, following protests and a widespread tobacco boycott."]}, {"page": "List of companies named after people", "response": ["* Reuters \u2013 Paul Reuter"]}, {"page": "Josaphat", "response": ["* Israel Beer Josaphat, the birth name of Paul Reuter"]}, {"page": "List of eponyms (L\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Paul Reuter, German-British journalist and businessman \u2013 Reuters news agency."]}, {"page": "List of British Jews", "response": ["* Paul Reuter, founder of Reuters"]}, {"page": "Reuter", "response": ["* Paul Reuter (1816\u20131899), founder of Reuters news agency"]}, {"page": "Mister Peabody", "response": ["# \"Paul Reuter\""]}, {"page": "Paul Julius, Baron von Reuter", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Reuter"]}, {"page": "Herbert Chermside", "response": ["Chermside was married twice.

Making a reasonable though not entirely perfect deal, he returned to Washington, reissued his book on his Russian journey down the Amur and was now able to take a back seat. Sibley recommended to the Western Union board that they buy all of Collins' rights and set up a subsidiary company. He received $100,000 and one tenth of the stock in the new Western Union Extension Company. The remaining stock was snapped up. With US Government support finalized through a bill signed by Abraham Lincoln and the British Columbia colonial assembly ratifying what had been agreed with London earlier, thus began the Russian American Telegraph (known in British Columbia as the Collins Overland Telegraph)."]}, {"page": "List of characters played by multiple actors in the same film", "response": ["*Dickie Moore and Edward G.
