In the same year, Gildon wrote a biography of Aphra Behn, claiming to have been a close friend of hers.  Inasmuch as he and Behn were both probably from Dorset and royalists (although only Gildon's family had been active during the Interregnum, whereas Behn was probably a Cavalier spy), it is possible that Gildon did know and seek out Behn, but his account of her life has many demonstrable errors in it (including a wholly credulous reading of Oroonoko).  At the time, however, he was a social correspondent with John Dryden and William Wycherley, as well as Behn, and he lived a courtly lifestyle.  He was a Deist around 1693\u20131698, and Daniel Defoe attacked him as a rake who had six well-fed whores and a starving wife.  Gildon edited the Works of Charles Blount in 1693 and added his own Deist tract, Oracles of Reason, to the edition.  In 1695, he produced a Life of Blount that made his subject heroic.  At the same time, he wrote a defense of Dryden's modernism against Thomas Rymer in 1694."]}, {"page": "Thomas Halyburton", "response": ["*Natural Religion Insufficient, and Revealed Religion Necessary, to Man's Happiness in his Present State (1714), an able statement of the orthodox Calvinistic criticism of the deism of Lord Herbert of Cherbury and Charles Blount"]}, {"page": "John Leland (Presbyterian)", "response": ["A View of the Principal Deistical Writers was first published in 1754 and subsequently expanded twice.

He ran into trouble in the case of an anonymous pamphlet called, King William and Queen Mary Conquerors which was really by Charles Blount. It argued a case similar to Bohun's own views. Thomas Babington Macaulay claimed that the Whig Blount in writing it deliberately set out to entrap the unpopular Bohun, but this is no longer accepted. In a House of Commons debate in 1693, Tories defending Bohun pointed out that the bishops Gilbert Burnet and William Lloyd had published similar arguments. The outcome was that Bohun lost the position, which was shortly abolished, and Burnet's Pastoral Letter of 1689 was included in a suppression order covering William and Queen Mary Conquerors. Bohun was briefly imprisoned, and after a two-year renewal of the Press Act providing for a Licenser as censor to 1695, the pre-publication censorship of the press was allowed by Parliament to lapse.David Hayton, Eveline Cruickshanks, Stuart Handley, The House of Commons, 1690-1715: Volume 1 (2002), p. 1066.Evan Whitton, Patrick Cook, The Cartel: Lawyers and Their Nine Magic Tricks (1998), p. 60.", "*Mark Goldie, \u2018Charles Blount's Intention in Writing \"King William and Queen Mary Conquerors\" (1693)\u2019, Notes and Queries 223 (1978): pp.\u00a0527\u201332."]}, {"page": "Henry Blount (knight)", "response": ["Blount married Hester Mainwaring, n\u00e9e Wase  and had seven sons including Thomas Pope Blount The Peerage website (see Blount baronets) and Charles Blount."]}, {"page": "Atheism during the Age of Enlightenment", "response": ["According to Justin Champion, the question in England was not one of determining religious truth, whether or not there was a god, but rather one of understanding how the priesthood had gained the power to determine what was accepted as truth.Justin Champion, The Pillars of Priestcraft Shaken (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 7.
