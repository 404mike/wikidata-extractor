Brief encounters: meetings with remarkable people (2001) p. 214 Macmillan's Defence Minister, Duncan Sandys, wrote at the time: \"Eden had no gift for leadership; under Macmillan as PM everything is better, Cabinet meetings are quite transformed\".Goodlad & Pearce, 2013 p.169 Many ministers found Macmillan to be more decisive and brisk than either Churchill or Eden had been. Another of Macmillan's ministers, Charles Hill, stated that Macmillan dominated Cabinet meetings \"by sheer superiority of mind and of judgement\".Goodlad & Pearce, 2013 p.170 Macmillan frequently made allusions to  history, literature and the classics at cabinet meetings, giving him a reputation as being both learned and entertaining, though many ministers found his manner too authoritarian. Macmillan had no \"inner cabinet\", and instead maintained one-on-one relationships with a few senior ministers such as Rab Butler who usually served as acting prime minister when Macmillan was on one of his frequent visits abroad. Selwyn Lloyd described Macmillan as treating most of his ministers like \"junior officers in a unit he commanded\". Lloyd recalled that Macmillan: \"regarded the Cabinet as an instrument to play upon, a body to be molded to his will...very rarely did he fail to get his way\" Macmillan generally allowed his ministers much leeway in managing their portfolios, and only intervened if he felt something had gone wrong. Macmillan was especially close to his three private secretaries, Tom Bligh, Freddie Bishop and Philip de Zulueta, who were his favourite advisers. Many cabinet ministers often complained that Macmillan took the advice of his private secretaries more seriously than he did their own."]}, {"page": "Beaumont College", "response": ["* Sir Philip de Zulueta (1925\u20131989), Private Secretary to the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan."]}, {"page": "Zulueta", "response": ["*Sir Philip de Zulueta (1925\u20131989), British diplomat and businessman"]}, {"page": "Francis de Zulueta", "response": ["He was a leading Catholic figure at Oxford for many years and the first Catholic Regius Professor since the Reformation, befriending Tolkien amongst others with whom he debated the nature of good and evil prior to The Lord of the Rings.
