It was written in both English and Zulu. Henry Callaway was an English missionary. His interest in the Zulu people began when he settled on the banks of the Nsunguze river where he created various books influenced by them. One of those books was The Religious Systems of The Amazulu. The book is presented in question and answer format. It is divided into four different sections which include, Unkulunkulu, Amatonga, Izinyanga Zokubula, and Abatakati.

He was born on January 17, 1817 at Lymington Somerset. After giving birth to Callaway, his family moved to London and then Crediton where he officially got educated in Crediton Grammar School. Callaway then went to become an assistant teacher in a small school in Heavitree. During his time at Heavitree, he was introduced to the idea of Quakerism by the headmaster of the school, William Dymond. He was prone to the idea of Quakerism and by the Spring of 1837, Henry Callaway was admitted to be the member of the Society of Friends, which is an official group for Quakers. He was admitted through a Quaker family that he privately tutored in\u00a0 Wellington. After his years in teaching, he decided to move into the medical field."]}, {"page": "Euphorbia cupularis", "response": ["Missionary Henry Callaway, living near the Umkomazi River recorded stories of the magical and spiritual power of the umdlebe tree in The Religious System of the Amazulu.

In Bishop Callaway's new diocese, apart from the mission station he started at Clydesdale, there were five or six other centres of missionary work. The oldest being St Mark's.  The first part of Callaway's work was spent trying to find the best way to organise the diocese.  The chief problem was to link Clydesdale with the St Mark's group in the south. He first attempted to establish the See at Clydesdale, which was too far north, and then at St Andrew's, not far from Lusikisiki, which turned out to be inaccessible except by sea.  He finally settled on a place on the Mthatha River.  A town sprang up around the bishop's mission station and Pro-cathedral.", "| Henry Callaway"]}, {"page": "College of the Transfiguration", "response": ["St Bede's College in Mthatha was founded in 1879 by Henry Callaway, the first bishop of the Diocese of St John. The purpose of the institution was the \"training of young natives, and colonists as clergy and teachers.\" At that time the primary task was to train clergy and catechist for the diocese. A shift happened in the mid-twentieth century when the college was given some provincial recognition as a result of a synod of bishops in 1955. Pressures brought to bear by the apartheid regime, and other institutional factors, resulted in the consideration of different schemes of amalgamation as early as the seventies. The college was temporarily closed in 1983 and the premises were leased to the University of Transkei for a year, before being re-opened in 1985. At the time of its closure in 1992 the college had an influential role in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa."]}, {"page": "Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Crediton", "response": ["* Henry Callaway, missionary"]}, {"page": "Callaway (surname)", "response": ["*Henry Callaway, bishop of the Anglican Church"]}, {"page": "Peter Masiza", "response": ["In 1871 Peter's brother, Paul Masiza was ordained deacon in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa by the Henry Cotterill, bishop of Grahamstown.
