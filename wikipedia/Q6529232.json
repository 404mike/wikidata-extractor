The following year, however, he made 1,071 runs at an average of 21 and appeared in virtually every match. He was then a regular member of the team until he retired, at the age of 45, at the end of the 1951 season.\nAs well as the 1,000 runs he scored in 1925, he passed the 1,000-run mark in every English first-class cricket season from 1928 to 1950, and his 2,446 runs at an average of more than 50 runs an innings in 1937 remains the Leicestershire record for a season. His first century, against Worcestershire at Ashby-de-la-Zouch in 1928, was a score of 207 at not much short of a run a minute, and by the time he retired he had added 44 others for Leicestershire: the total of 45 first-class centuries remains the county record. He also holds the county record for most first-class runs with 30,143, and his seven centuries in 1937 have been equalled for Leicestershire by Willie Watson and Brian Davison, but never beaten.\nBerry was a record-holder in another respect as well: when cricket resumed after the Second World War, Leicestershire had no suitable amateur to captain the side, so Berry became the county captain. Though Ewart Astill had captained Leicestershire in a similar hiatus in 1935, Berry was the first professional captain for one of the English cricket counties who was more than a stopgap: he was reappointed for two further seasons, and in his final season as captain, 1948, he was joined as a professional county captain by Tom Dollery of Warwickshire.\nBerry was perhaps unlucky not to be chosen for representative matches, but was not very successful in the few games he played for teams other than Leicestershire. Every single one of his scores of 50 and over was made for the county side. He was a good outfielder but no bowler.\nAfter retiring from cricket, he became the cricket coach at Uppingham School. For most of his cricket career, he was known as L. G. Berry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Les Berry|| 30,143"]}, {"page": "James Langridge", "response": ["Langridge was captain of Sussex from 1950 to 1952, only the third professional player, after Les Berry of Leicestershire and Tom Dollery of Warwickshire, to be appointed the regular captain of a county club in the 20th century (Ewart Astill captained Leicestershire for a season in 1935, but only because no amateur could be found to do the job).

In Les Berry, they had the only professional captain in the County Championship. In July, they were involved in two exciting finishes, first when Middlesex were set to score 66 in 25 minutes and got them, courtesy of Edrich and Compton, to win by ten wickets with only four minutes to spare. Second, in their home match against Derbyshire, Leicestershire themselves succeeded in a run chase scoring 391 to win by three wickets at over eighty runs an hour, the winning run coming from a straight six off the third ball of the final over. Leicestershire were a strong batting side with Berry, Vic Jackson, Gerry Lester, Francis Prentice, Maurice Tompkin and George Watson all exceeding 1,000 runs while all-rounder Anthony Riddington scored over 800. Wicketkeeper Percy Corrall claimed 59 victims in championship matches. The main bowler was Jack Walsh, a great exponent of slow left-arm wrist-spin, who took 152 wickets in all matches. Jackson and the veteran James Sperry bowled well but Leicestershire's main need was a good pace bowler.

He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win.

He took four wickets in his first match against Hampshire, and this was followed by scores of 21 and 40 in the second game, which was against Essex. In 1948, Leicestershire had appointed the professional, Les Berry, as captain, only the second appointment of a professional by one of the first-class counties since the 1890s (the previous instance had also been by Leicestershire, when Ewart Astill was appointed captain for the 1935 season). In both 1935 and 1948, the appointment had been necessitated because no amateur was available to lead the team: Wisden also reported that \"possibly affected by the cares of captaincy\", Berry \"did not reproduce the form of previous years\"."]}, {"page": "Kirkby Road", "response": ["* Highest individual innings: 89 by Les Berry for Leicestershire v Warwickshire, 1946"]}, {"page": "Francis Prentice", "response": ["The move to open the innings was an immediate success: in 1937, Prentice scored 1506 runs at an average of 32.73 and of his opening partnership with Les Berry Wisden wrote that \"with the exception perhaps of Yorkshire and Sussex no other county possessed such consistent opening batsmen\". It added: \"Prentice confirmed all the high opinions formed of him. Using more strokes than previously, he also retained his solid defence and proved an extremely difficult batsman to dislodge.\" In the first match of the season, Prentice made his first first-class century, an innings of 163 against Hampshire. He followed that with 127 in the second game, against Northamptonshire, and in both games he shared a century opening partnership with Berry. He made four centuries in the season. In addition, because of a shortage of spin bowlers, he bowled more than 400 overs of off-spin, and though his 24 wickets cost more than 55 runs apiece, against Lancashire he took five wickets for 82 runs, his first five-wicket return, though the Lancastrians totalled 469 in their only innings of the match. He was less prolific in both 1938 and 1939, failing to score 1000 runs in either season and missing a few matches through injury in each of them."]}, {"page": "Norman Armstrong", "response": ["In 1933, at the age of 40, Armstrong became the first Leicestershire player to score more than 2,000 runs in a season when he made 2112 runs at an average of 43.10. It was a very poor season for Leicestershire and they finished bottom of the County Championship for the first time (they had been jointly at the bottom twice before). Leicestershire's improvement and a slightly wetter season accounted for a fall in his aggregate in 1934 \u2013 he played 10 fewer innings in the season than he had in 1933 \u2013 but he maintained his average at 42.52. He averaged more than 40 again in 1937, though Les Berry was higher in the averages, and in 1939 he was top of the Leicestershire table again, though once more it was in a season when the county finished at the bottom of the Championship."]}, {"page": "Gerry Lester", "response": ["Lester returned to Leicestershire for the resumption of first-class cricket in 1946; the county had recruited Vic Jackson as well as Walsh, and Lester's bowling was used less frequently. Ironically, though he had slipped down the pecking order in terms of bowling, Lester's record in 1946 was his best-ever in terms of average, his 31 wickets costing 17.93 runs apiece, ahead of both Walsh and Jackson in the averages. More importantly in terms of the side's needs, however, he started making more runs, and by the end of the season he had frequently become captain Les Berry's opening partner, with Frank Prentice moving down to No 3. The record in 1946 was not spectacular, with 696 runs at an average of 23.20. But in 1947, batting up and down the order, he played regularly in virtually every game for the first time, passed 1,000 runs in a season for the first time and also scored his first century, an unbeaten innings of 106 against Somerset. His batting was not entertaining: \"Instinctively, he was a free-scoring player, but the pressures of professional cricket turned him into one of the circuit's stodgier players,\" Wisden recorded in his obituary in 1999. In a very dry and hot summer and with Leicestershire lacking bowlers, Lester bowled more than 600 overs in 1947, and his 42 wickets included his career-best figures of six for 42 against the South Africans."]}, {"page": "Gustavus Fowke", "response": ["Fowke was one of those over-40s, but was in fact only at the start of his cricket career, and he remained as Leicestershire's captain for the next five seasons, overseeing a transition in the team that saw the retirement of older players such as John King, Samuel Coe and Arthur Mounteney and the introduction of the nucleus of the team of the 1930s with Les Berry, Norman Armstrong, Haydon Smith and Alan Shipman. His own performances did not equal those of 1922, but nor did they fall much short: he made at least 500 runs in each season and his season average only once dipped below 15 runs per innings. His only century for Leicestershire was an innings of 104 in the match against Northamptonshire in 1923. In that match and in others until the emergence of Eddie Dawson, Berry and Shipman as regular opening batsmen, Fowke opened the innings, but later he dropped down the batting order to No 6 or No 7, and sometimes even lower. He missed a few matches in 1926 through a leg strain, but otherwise maintained fitness through to the end of the 1927 season, when he played in 29 first-class matches, more than in any other season, and then retired."]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Among their better players were the wicket-keepers Tom Sidwell and Percy Corrall; batsmen Norman Armstrong, Les Berry and Eddie Dawson; and bowlers Ewart Astill, George Geary and Haydon Smith."]}]}}
