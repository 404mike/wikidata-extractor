The popularity of the latter song gave Wang Chung the ability to spend two months touring the United States on their own and with the Romantics and Berlin. In 1984 they would be the opening act for the Cars on their \"Heartbeat City\" tour; Costin would leave the band following this tour, and went on to form his own group, Heroes, which released the album Here We Are on RCA Records in 1987.Huang Chung.
