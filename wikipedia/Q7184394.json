A former fairground worker employed at the Rainbow pub in the Digbeth area of the city, Smith killed his victims over a four-day period in November 2000, befriending two of them at the Rainbow before carrying out the crimes. All three victims were mutilated almost beyond recognition, but Smith was quickly identified as the killer because of the overwhelming evidence linking him to the deaths.\nSmith's first victim was Jodie Hyde, a recovering butane gas addict whom he met at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He is thought to have strangled her before setting her body on fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, as he drove home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out.\nSmith was apprehended after he contacted West Midlands Police saying that he wished to make a statement about Corcoran's disappearance. At the time, however, her body had not been positively identified, and inquiries quickly established that some aspects of his account were false. The murder inquiry, named Operation Green, uncovered a large quantity of strong evidence incriminating Smith, but at first he denied responsibility. He maintained his innocence as his trial began in July 2001, but later in the proceedings changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The motive for his crimes was unclear, but police who arrested him believed that a \"lack of permanent sexual relations\" was a contributing factor.\nDetectives also investigated the death of a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip Smith", "response": ["*Philip Smith (British Army officer) (died 1894)", "*Philip Smith (criminal) (born 1965), British spree killer", "*Philip Smith (footballer) (1885\u20131918), British footballer", "*Philip Smith (musician) (born 1952), American trumpeter", "*Philip Smith (theater owner) (died 1961), American theater owner", "*Philip Smith (VC) (1829\u20131906), Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*Philip Smith, Baron Smith of Hindhead (born 1966), Conservative member of the British House of Lords", "*Philip Smith (Northern Ireland politician) (born 1967), member of the Northern Ireland Assembly", "*Philip Smith (producer), New Zealand film and television producer and writer", "*Philip Smith (born 1988), founder of the Friends of the British Overseas Territories"]}, {"page": "Rose West", "response": ["*Philip Smith, fellow multiple killer who was a former neighbour of the Wests"]}, {"page": "Philip John Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philip Smith (criminal)"]}, {"page": "Jodie Hyde", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philip Smith (criminal)"]}, {"page": "Rosemary Corcoran", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philip Smith (criminal)"]}, {"page": "Operation Green (police investigation)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philip Smith (criminal)"]}, {"page": "Murdered sex workers in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Possible victim of Alun Kyte, the 'Midlands Ripper' or Philip Smith", "| Philip Smith was jailed for her murder and the murder of two other women", "* Philip Smith"]}, {"page": "List of nicknames of serial killers", "response": ["** Philip Smith"]}]}}
