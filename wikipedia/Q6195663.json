He was born in Werneth, Oldham, Lancashire, and died at Oldham. His name was Jim, not James. \nThe younger brother of England and Lancashire bowler Malcolm Hilton, Jim Hilton was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. Unable to break into regular Lancashire first team cricket because of the competition for slow bowling places from his brother and Roy Tattersall, Hilton moved south and played two full seasons for Somerset in 1954 and 1955. Even in a side as poor as Somerset's \u2013 the county finished bottom of the County Championship for four consecutive seasons from 1952 to 1955 \u2013 Hilton's bowling opportunities were limited by the presence of Johnny Lawrence and John McMahon, and he did not take more than 42 wickets in a season. \nIn 1956, fellow off-spinner Brian Langford returned from National Service and became first-choice, and though Hilton played fairly regularly again in 1957, he left the county's staff at the end of the season. \nHe reappeared for Lancashire in Second Eleven matches for several further years, but did not play first-class cricket again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alnwick", "response": ["*Jim Hilton (1894\u20131964), painter for Shell Oil and immigrant to Canada"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Hilton", "response": ["1956 was Hilton's best season. He took 147 wickets and was chosen as one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year. However, in 1957, he lost accuracy and was frequently left out in favour of Tommy Greenhough. He came back with 94 wickets in 1958, including a career best 8 for 19 against the New Zealanders. His younger brother Jim played a few times for Lancashire, and more often for Somerset. At Weston-super-Mare in 1956, Malcolm Hilton took 14 Somerset wickets and Jim Hilton responded with eight Lancashire victims."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Jim Hilton (1954\u20131957) 71 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Hilton (surname)", "response": ["*Jim Hilton, Canadian businessman, advertiser and singer"]}, {"page": "John McMahon (Surrey and Somerset cricketer)", "response": ["Somerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.", "The reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved."]}, {"page": "Geoff Lomax", "response": ["Lomax was one of three new Somerset players in 1954 with previous experience of county cricket \u2013 the others were his Lancashire off-spin colleague Jim Hilton and the Australian-born Surrey slow left-arm bowler John McMahon. As at Lancashire, the balance of the Somerset bowling attack was very much towards spin bowling; Lomax was used as an opening bowler, but even so he bowled fewer than half the overs that McMahon delivered, and his 46 wickets for the season came at the rather high bowling average of 32.52. These figures, however, included a return of six for 75 in Surrey's first innings in the match at The Oval, and these were to remain the best bowling figures of his career. Lomax's batting improved and he batted mostly at No 6 or No 7 in the order. Early in the season against Yorkshire he equalled his previous highest score of 78. Then in mid-August he scored 101, his maiden first-class century, in the match against Northamptonshire at Taunton, despite sustaining an elbow injury against an attack that included Frank Tyson, then at the height of his fast-bowling powers. In all matches, Lomax made 983 runs at an average of 19.27 runs per innings. He was awarded his Somerset county cap."]}, {"page": "Roy Smith (cricketer, born 1930)", "response": ["After that, Smith's cricket career declined. In 1954, Somerset had recruited other slow bowlers, John McMahon and Jim Hilton, so his bowling was not called on at all. But his batting failed and he made less than half his 1953 total of runs: 474, at an average of 13.94, with only one score of more than 50. There was no respite in 1955, when new recruits to Somerset's batting line-up meant there was room for him in only five matches, and in 1956, when Somerset finally came off the bottom of the Championship table after four years there, he played only for the second team, leaving the staff at the end of the season."]}]}}
