A well-liked man (who, in later years, kept a pub in his native Sheffield), Ulyett was popularly known as \"Happy Jack\", once musing memorably that Yorkshire played him only for his good behaviour and his whistling. A fine all round sportsman, Ulyett played football in the 1882\u201383 and 1883\u201384 seasons as goalkeeper for Sheffield Wednesday.", "link_mentions": {}}}
