He first appeared in the County Championship in 1993 for Derbyshire and looked capable of being a first-team choice for the Peakites, before going back to study in 1994. Finding limited overs cricket difficult upon his return, and conceding to the freer styles of batsmen such as Daffy Defreitas, his bowling become just as overlooked, though when he was given his chance he was shown to possess a superb economy rate. Steer was also the first player to score a 1000 runs in a season for Derbyshire 2nd XI (1993) and in the same season won rapidcricketline player of the month in July.\nSteer played in the International Youth Tournament and the Oxbridge Festival finals in 1987 and 1988 respectively, finishing on the winning side both times. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler, and an occasional wicket-keeper.\nGary now works as the Director of Cricket at *Bedford School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bedford School", "response": ["*Gary Steer (born 1970) Derbyshire County Cricket Club"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1993", "response": ["The season saw the debuts of Adrian Rollins, Gary Steer and Matthew Vandrau who all played in the following season.
