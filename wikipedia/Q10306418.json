He appears in Dante's Inferno in the lowest circle of Hell, set apart for traitors: \"him who, at one blow, had chest and shadow / shattered by Arthur's hand\" (Canto XXXII).Inferno, Canto XXXII, lines 61\u201362 (Mandelbaum translation). Mordred is especially prominent in popular modern era Arthurian literature, as well as in film, television, and comics.Torregrossa, Michael A., \"Will the 'Reel' Mordred Please Stand Up? Strategies for Representing Mordred in American and British Arthurian Film\" in Cinema Arthuriana: Twenty Essays (Rev. edn.), ed. Kevin J. Harty. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2002 (pb. 2009), pp. 199\u2013210. He has been portrayed on screen by Leonard Penn (The Adventures of Sir Galahad 1949), Brian Worth (The Adventures of Sir Lancelot 1956\u20131957), David Hemmings (Camelot 1967), Robert Addie (Excalibur 1981), Nickolas Grace (Morte d'Arthur 1984), Simon Templeman (The Legend of Prince Valiant 1991\u20131994), Jason Done (Merlin 1998), Craig Sheffer\u00a0(Merlin: The Return 2000), Hans Matheson (The Mists of Avalon 2001), and Asa Butterfield and Alexander Vlahos (Merlin 2008\u20132012), among others. In such modern adaptations, Morgause is often conflated with (and into) the character of Morgan le Fay, who may be Mordred's mother or alternatively his lover or wife. A few works of the Middle Ages and today, however, portray Mordred as less a traitor and more a conflicted opportunist, or even a victim of fate.The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 394. Even Malory, who depicts Mordred as a villain, notes that the people rallied to him because, \"with Arthur was none other life but war and strife, and with Sir Mordred was great joy and bliss.\""]}, {"page": "1998 in film", "response": ["| Merlin || NBC / Hallmark Entertainment || Steve Barron (director); Edward Khmara, David Stevens, Peter Barnes (screenplay); Sam Neill, Helena Bonham Carter, John Gielgud, Rutger Hauer, Miranda Richardson, Isabella Rossellini, Martin Short, James Earl Jones, Billie Whitelaw, Lena Headey, Jason Done, Rachel De Thame, Mark Jax, Jeremy Sheffield, Sebastian Roch\u00e9, John McEnery, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Nicholas Clay, Robert Addie, Keith Baxter, Nickolas Grace, John Turner, Peter Woodthorpe ||  Action, Adventure, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Yasunori Matsumoto", "response": ["* Merlin \u2013 Mordred (Jason Done)"]}, {"page": "Merlin (miniseries)", "response": ["After some initial hostility, the nobles unite behind Arthur as their rightful king.
