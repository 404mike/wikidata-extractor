Storylines included the cot death of 14-month-old Hassan Osman, Nick Cotton's (John Altman) homophobia, racism and murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton), Arthur Fowler's (Bill Treacher) unemployment reflecting the recession of the 1980s, the rape of Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) in 1988 by James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) and Michelle Fowler's (Susan Tully) teenage pregnancy. The show also dealt with prostitution, mixed-race relationships, shoplifting, sexism, divorce, domestic violence and mugging. In 1989, the programme came under criticism in the British media for being too depressing, and according to writer Colin Brake, the programme makers were determined to change this. In 1989, there was a deliberate attempt to increase the lighter, more comic aspects of life in Albert Square. This led to the introduction of some characters who were deliberately conceived as comic or light-hearted. Brake suggested that humour was an important element in EastEnders storylines during 1989, with a greater amount of slapstick and light comedy than before. He classed 1989's changes as a brave experiment, and suggested that while some found this period of EastEnders entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility. Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as domestic violence, drugs, rape and racism, Brake reflected that the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between \"light and heavy storylines\" gave the illusion that the show had lost a \"certain edge\"."]}, {"page": "1979 in film", "response": ["| Quadrophenia || World-Northal Corporation / The Who Films Ltd || Franc Roddam (director/screenplay); Dave Humphries, Martin Stellman, Pete Townshend (screenplay); Phil Daniels, Leslie Ash, Toyah Willcox, Philip Davis, Mark Wingett, Sting, Ray Winstone, Gary Shail, Garry Cooper, Trevor Laird, Andy Sayce, Kate Williams, Michael Elphick, Kim Neve, Benjamin Whitrow, Daniel Peacock, Jeremy Child, John Phillips, Timothy Spall, Patrick Murray, George Innes, John Bindon, P.H.

Dot first appeared in EastEnders in July 1985 as the mother of notorious criminal Nick Cotton (John Altman). The character worked as a launderette assistant for most of that time, along with original character Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Dot moved away with her son and his family in 1993. In reality, Brown left the show in 1993, unhappy with the axing of her co-star Peter Dean, who played Pete Beale from the show's first episode to early 1993. Brown returned to the role in April 1997, and on 28 April 2017, Dot overtook Pat Butcher (Pam St Clement) as the second-longest-serving character in EastEnders, surpassed only by original character Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt).  In a special episode entitled EastEnders: Dot's Story (2003) a young Dot was played by Tallulah Pitt-Brown in flashbacks. In April 2012, Brown took a six-month break from the show to write her memoirs. Dot temporarily departed on 18 May 2012. She returned on 14 January 2013. In February 2015, Dot began appearing less frequently due to Brown gradually losing her eyesight; this aspect of her life was later written into her character the following year. Brown left the role in January 2020.", "Aged 18, Dot married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock). The following year, he forced her to have an abortion; threatening to leave her if she did not, but left anyway. While Dot was giving birth to their son, Nick (John Altman), Charlie was having an affair with her sister, Rose, in Liverpool. She raised Nick alone, with Charlie making unannounced returns and departures sporadically, and although Dot doted on Nick, she was not an affectionate mother.", "Although Dot had been referred to since the very early episodes of the programme as the mother of villain Nick Cotton (John Altman), she did not actually appear on-screen until episode 40 in July 1985. Dot was conceptualised by show creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, along with the other original characters. Introduced as the \"bible thumping, arch-gossip\" of the launderette, Dot was a character who bridged the generations. The actress June Brown was given the role after being recommended by actor Leslie Grantham, who played original character, Den Watts.", "Dot's relationship with her wayward son Nick (John Altman), has been a feature of the character's narrative since her inception. Unlike Dot, Nick is scripted as a semi-regular character, one who comes and goes sporadically and, as authors Jill Marshall and Angela Werndly have observed, \"we know heartache is in store for Dot Cotton every time her son, 'Nasty Nick', turns up [...] The recurrence of generic elements means we derive pleasure from expectation and prediction.\"", "Executive producer Diederick Santer has discussed the \"wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship\" Nick shares with Dot and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: \"There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They've let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they'll have changed.\" Actor Leslie Grantham has stated that Dot is the \"one friend in [Nick's] life\", while series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: \"Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot.\" Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: \"No matter what he does, she'll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know.\"", "Following pleas from Brown to resurrect Nick, John Altman returned to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin), who was born in 2002 after Nick's previous exit.  Altman explained: \"Nick needed something, because I think if he didn't have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast.\" As the storyline progressed, it was revealed that Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.", "Producers decided to kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died off-screen when crashing his lorry on a motorway. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick had been involved in a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: \"We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [Nick] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only in a state of shock and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [her friend] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change.\" Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, \"I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste.

Nick's eventual demise in 2015 pays homage to this relationship, with Dot \u2013 finally realising the extent of Nick's villainous behaviour and accepting his inability to change \u2013 ultimately deciding to allow Nick to die, rather than seeking medical assistance after he has a fatal reaction to heroin. Her motive being to let Jesus decide whether Nick should live or die. John Altman, however, tells that producers were told to 'write him out' of the show after he opposed a decision to make his character gay.John Altman, AKA Eastender's Nasty Nick: It's almost like the Taliban. You can't say what you like., GB News, Sep 13, 2021", "Nick Cotton was the twenty-fourth character invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Nick was not part of Holland's and Smith's original vision for EastEnders, and his creation came about as an afterthought. The first episode of the series was to include the death of an elderly resident, Reg Cox, who had been brutally attacked in his home, and left to die. During the first writers' meeting, where the writers were introduced to the intended characters and early scripts, each independently wanted to know which character had killed Reg. However, Holland and Smith had never intended for the murderer to be unveiled. They had no idea who had killed Reg Cox, and they had felt that \"the who\" was not important. The fact that he was dead following an attack was the important issue, and Reg's murder was not intended to be solved, it was only there to tell the audience, from the outset, that Walford was a rough and tough place. The writers opposed this. They accused Holland of throwing away a great opportunity and suggested that a murder hunt would provide an array of dramatic possibilities that would captivate the audience. After deciding that all of the twenty-three original characters were incapable of committing the crime, Holland decided to invent an entirely new character, in the form of Nick Cotton. The original character outline for Nick read: \"His image is exclusively macho. Vanishes for weeks on end. Mum doesn't ask questions... Unlike Den, Nick is a real crook. Worms his way into people's confidentiality and homes. From then on, lives on his wits. Waiting for the moment to strike; to nick the cash and disappear...Usually chooses his victims who, for one reason or another, are frightened to report him...Nick's a heroin addict\". As Nick was only intended to be a semi-regular character, Julia Smith was not involved in his casting and the actor John Altman was chosen by the directors. However, she requested he was axed, after he refused to portray Nick having a gay relationship with Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) because he thought it was out of character.", "Nick has been described by EastEnders' executive producer Diederick Santer as \"the show's premier villain\". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who \"thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him\". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: \"You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them\", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that \"There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever\". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: \"It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn\u2019t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy.\" John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the \"wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship\" Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton (June Brown), and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: \"There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They\u2019ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they\u2019ll have changed.\" Grantham has stated that Dot is the \"one friend in [Nick's] life\", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: \"Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot.\" Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: \"No matter what he does, she\u2019ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know.\"", "John Altman reprised his role as Nick after a five-year absence in March 1998. He ran into Dot's close friend Nigel Bates who told him to stay away. He returned a few weeks later after Dot discovered him hiding in her house. He tells Dot that he is dying of AIDS caused by his drug addiction, and that he was planning an armed robbery to pay for his medication. Dot believed Nick and arranged the money for him but soon discovered he had been lying about his illness all along, and had him rearrested and sent back to prison.", "John Altman was nominated for 'Villain of the Year' at The British Soap Awards 2015, but lost out to Hollyoaks star, Jeremy Sheffield.", "* Walford Gazette, John Altman Interview"]}, {"page": "Ethel Skinner", "response": ["Ethel lives above Doctor Legg's (Leonard Fenton) surgery and works as the cleaner in the pub.

The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick (John Altman). Nick had been involved in a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: \"We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [Nick] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him.

John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste.
