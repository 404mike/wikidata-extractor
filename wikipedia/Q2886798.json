He became a full-time writer in 1970. In addition to horror and detective fiction, Copper was perhaps best known for his series of Solar Pons stories continuing the character created as a tribute to Sherlock Holmes by August Derleth. Copper's interests included swimming, gardening, travel, sailing and historic film material. One of England's leading film collectors, his private archive contained almost one thousand titles (at 1977). He founded the Tunbridge Wells Vintage Film Society and often gave talks at various film organisations in London. He was  a member of the British Film Society and the Vintage Film Circle of London. Copper was a longtime resident of Sevenoaks in Kent, and was survived by his French-born wife Annie (n\u00e9e Guerin) to whom he had been married since 1960.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fu Manchu", "response": ["* several stories in August Derleth's detective series Solar Pons, in which he appears as \"the Doctor\"; Derleth's successor, Basil Copper, also made use of the character."]}, {"page": "Night Gallery", "response": ["Serling wrote many of the teleplays, including \"Camera Obscura\" (based on a short story by Basil Copper), \"The Caterpillar\" (based on a short story by Oscar Cook), \"Class of '99\", \"Cool Air\" (based on a short story by H.P.
