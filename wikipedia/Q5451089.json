True to his nature, Finn declined the inheritance of his castle and although he retained his title, he preferred the life of an anonymous drifter. Carol and Finn embarked on a passionate and sometimes tumultuous relationship, climaxing in a marathon 48-hour session on Finn's bus, yet Chis free-spirited nature and roving eye brought the relationship to a premature close.

After using Finn's title to secure a bank loan, the pair finally got the go ahead to build The Loft. Problems in Finn's relationship with Tony resurfaced when an unsuspecting Finn embarked on an affair with a woman called Victoria (Fiona Mollison). Even Finn was shocked to discover that she was Tony's mother. Unsurprisingly, Tony was actively against the union, but the two carried on regardless. Soon, Victoria became Victoria Finnigan and along with the marriage came Finn's new role as Tony's stepfather.
