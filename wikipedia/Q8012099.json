Gatley produced a model of a large bas-relief representing \"The Overthrow of Pharaoh in the Red Sea\", which was highly praised by Gibson. Early in 1855 he was entrusted with the companion bas-relief, \"The Song of Moses and Miriam\". The Pharaoh bas-relief was finished in time for the 1862 International Exhibition, but the 'Song of Miriam' was completed only just before the sculptor's death. In the judgement of Robert Edmund Graves, Gatley's DNB biographer, \"The two bas-reliefs are in strong contrast to each other, the idea of rejoicing being as powerfully given in the one work as is that of fear and impending destruction in the other\"."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Henry Miller||Whig"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Henry Miller||Whig"]}, {"page": "Samuel Christy-Miller", "response": ["Christy was related, though distantly, to William Henry Miller, who died in 1848.

Miller was childless, so upon his death in 1848, the execution of his will fell to a distant relative, Samuel Christy. The will contained instructions to bury Miller's body in a 20-foot-deep pit above which, The Scotsman reported, would be built a monument \"in commemoration of the private virtues of the deceased, for, as a public character, he was unknown.\" \u00a320,000 was allocated for construction. Although the monument would originally have been a solitary structure in a moorland half a mile east of Miller's house, it is now somewhat incongruously surrounded by 1930s bungalows on Craigentinny Crescent.
