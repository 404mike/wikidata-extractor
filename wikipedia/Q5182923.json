He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1905 to 1918, representing Torrens (1905\u20131915) and Sturt (1915\u20131918). Elected for the United Labor Party, he served as Treasurer in the Verran government, succeeded Verran as Labor leader in 1913, and was elected Premier after the Labor victory at the 1915 state election.\nVaughan's career was curtailed by the 1916\u201317 Labor split over conscription in World War I, as Vaughan and other supporters of conscription were expelled from the Labor Party in early 1917. Vaughan continued in office until July heading a minority government of the splinter National Party; however, his government was then ousted by the conservative Liberal Union opposition of Archibald Peake. The National Party went into coalition, serving under Peake as junior instead of senior partner, but Vaughan did not take a ministerial portfolio, spent most of his remaining term overseas, and was defeated at the 1918 election after launching a last-minute campaign as an independent candidate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 15", "response": ["*  1947 \u2013 Crawford Vaughan, Australian politician, 27th Premier of South Australia (b. 1874)"]}, {"page": "July 14", "response": ["*  1874   \u2013 Crawford Vaughan, Australian politician, 27th Premier of South Australia (d. 1947)"]}, {"page": "Premier of South Australia", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Vaughan, Crawford\"| Crawford Vaughan(1874\u20131947)MHA for Sturt"]}, {"page": "Vaughan (surname)", "response": ["*Crawford Vaughan (1874\u20131947), Australian politician, Premier of South Australia 1915\u20131917"]}, {"page": "Dean Brown", "response": ["Brown became the first premier to leave office without facing an election since Crawford Vaughan."]}, {"page": "Arthur Blackburn", "response": ["Blackburn was the first member of the 10th Battalion and first South Australian to be awarded the VC, and his VC was earned in the costliest battle in Australian history. He was discharged from hospital on 30 September, and attended an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 4 October to receive his VC from King George V. The same day, McCann received the Military Cross for his own actions at Pozi\u00e8res that immediately preceded those of Blackburn. Blackburn embarked at Southampton for Australia aboard the hospital ship Karoola on 16 October for six months' rest, arriving home via Melbourne on 3 December. The train he arrived on was met by the state premier, Crawford Vaughan, but he declined to speak to the assembled crowd about his exploits. The following day he was f\u00eated by the staff and students of St Peter's College."]}, {"page": "1916 Australian conscription referendum", "response": ["Hughes met with the Victorian Political Executive of the Labor Party, chaired by Executive President E. J. Holloway. \"For an hour, he addressed members, trying by every one of his many oratorical, logical and political tricks to convert all, or at least some, of the Executive members to support his referendum campaign\". Arguing on points of morale and maintaining Australian honour, Hughes concluded that he \"was going to fight for a \"Yes\" vote as though he were fighting for his very life\". Holloway and his supporters were unconvinced, and were not moved by the speech. Hughes would have a similar lack of success at other state Labor organisations. Days later he spoke before the New South Wales Labor executive and then a special meeting convened of the New South Wales Trades and Labor Council. No records are kept of those meetings; however, motions were passed at their conclusion reaffirming opposition to conscription. Some prominent Labor politicians, though, including New South Wales Premier William Holman and South Australian Premier Crawford Vaughan, backed Hughes and rejected the party line. Ultimately, Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria declared themselves against the proposal in state caucuses. South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania did not take a position, and supported the principle of the referendum for the people to decide. Hughes had been unsuccessful in taking the bulk of his party along with him."]}, {"page": "Millicent Preston-Stanley", "response": ["Preston-Stanley married Crawford Vaughan, former Premier of South Australia, in 1934.
