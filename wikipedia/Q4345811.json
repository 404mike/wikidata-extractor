His great-uncle Thomas Parry was bishop of Barbados and his great-grandfather Edward Parry was Rector of Llanferres, Denbighshire.Parry himself studied at the Middle Temple and was called to the Bar in 1885. He was Judge of Manchester County Court 1894-1911 and became Judge of Lambeth County Court in 1911. He wrote several plays and books for children. He was appointed to sit on a Pensions Appeal Tribunal in the summer of 1917, which dealt with appeals against governmental decisions on military pensions, and later published a book on War Pensions: Past and Present, co-authored with Sir Alfred Codrington, another member of the Tribunal.He died in Sevenoaks, Kent, aged 80.Beyond the stark details of this curriculum vitae, much can be learnt about Parry as a man from his autobiography. To cite one anecdote, he took a summer holiday, probably in 1895 or 1896, in the tiny village of Rhoscolyn on Anglesey and became a great friend of the Revd. John Hopkins, the Rector. When Hopkins died in 1901, Parry was instrumental (with others) in erecting a fine copper memorial tablet in the church. He also published an appreciation in the Cornhill Magazine. The obvious mutual empathy and warmth of the friendship between two men of such different backgrounds is a credit to both: the London-educated judge, son of a barrister and the iron miner (before his ordination) and son of a Merthyr publican, fined for selling beer during the time of divine service.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Furniss", "response": ["*Gamble Gold by Judge Edward Abbott Parry \u2014 1907"]}, {"page": "Culture of Manchester", "response": ["Edward Abbott Parry (born in London in 1863) was a judge and dramatist who lived in Manchester as judge of Manchester County Court 1894\u20131911.Resident of Burlington Road, Withington--Lejeune, C.

Shaw was six years older than Denis Eden but shared a similar background, having attended St John's Wood Art School before the Royal Academy Schools, and was also influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite movement in style and subject matter.For more on Byam Shaw see Tim Barringer, 'Not a \"modern\" as the word is now understood'? Byam Shaw, imperialism and the poetics of professional society', in David Peters Corbett & Lara Perry (eds.), English Art, 1860\u20131914: Modern Artists and Identity (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000). It seems likely that Helen Parry was in turn influenced by Shaw's medievalist aesthetic \u2013 although there seem to be no available reproductions of her work."]}]}}
