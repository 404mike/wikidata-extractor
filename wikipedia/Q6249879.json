He was Member of Parliament (MP) for East Kerry from 1900 to 1910, taking his seat in the United Kingdom House of Commons.Murphy was first elected to Parliament at the general election in October 1900 when he was returned unopposed as a candidate of the Irish Parliamentary Party. He was re-elected at the 1906 general election, with a narrow majority of 54 votes over rival nationalist candidate Eugene O'Sullivan. However, at the next general election, in January 1910, O'Sullivan won the seat with a majority of 489 votes (10%).Murphy then launched an electoral petition, claiming that the vote had been rigged and that O'Sullivan had only won through violence and intimidation. The court cleared O'Sullivan of vote rigging but found him guilty of intimidation. The election was declared void, unseating O'Sullivan and creating a vacancy, but no by-election was called before the December 1910 general election. Murphy did not stand again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Murphy", "response": ["John Murphy may refer to:", "*John Murphy (priest) (1753\u20131798), one of the leaders during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 ", "*John Murphy (Saint Patrick's Battalion) (fl. 1846-1848), Irish soldier", "*John Murphy (fiddle player) (1875\u20131955), Irish fiddle player", "*John Murphy (musician) (1959\u20132015), Australian drummer and multi-instrument musician", "*Kim Deal or Mrs. John Murphy (born 1961), musician", "*John Murphy (composer) (born 1965), British composer of film scores", "*John Murphy (Alabama politician) (1786\u20131841), American Democratic Governor and Congressman from Alabama", "*John Murphy (Queensland politician) (1820\u20131883), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*John Murphy (1821\u20131883), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "*John Murphy (Irish Parliamentary Party politician) (1870\u20131930), member of the UK Parliament for East Kerry, 1900\u20131910", "*John Murphy (Canadian politician) (born 1937), member of the Canadian House of Commons, 1993\u20131997", "*John Murphy (Texas politician) (born 1945), councilmember and former mayor pro tem of Richardson, Texas", "*John Murphy (Australian politician) (born 1950), member of the House of Representatives", "*John Murphy (priest) (1753\u20131798), one of the leaders during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 ", "*John Murphy (bishop) (1905\u20131995), Roman Catholic archbishop", "*John Murphy (pitcher) (1858\u20131905), baseball pitcher", "*John Murphy (footballer, born 1872) (1872\u20131924), English footballer", "*John Murphy (infielder) (1879\u20131949), baseball infielder", "*John Murphy (footballer, born 1886), for Bradford and Luton", "*John Murphy (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u20131921), Scottish footballer with Hamilton Academical, Bury, Rotherham County ", "*John Murphy (footballer, born 1898), Scottish footballer for Heart of Midlothian and Kilmarnock ", "*John Murphy (1900s footballer), for Stoke and Bradford", "*John Murphy (athlete) (1895\u20131972), American high jumper", "*John Murphy (sport shooter) (1919-1997), Australian Olympic shooter", "*John Murphy (basketball) (1924\u20132003), American basketball player", "*John Murphy (American football coach) (born c.1932), college football coach for the Toledo Rockets", "*John Murphy (footballer, born 1942) (1942-2020), Scottish footballer", "*John Murphy (Australian rules footballer) (born 1949), former champion player with the Fitzroy Football Club in the 1960s and 1970s", "*John Murphy (swimmer) (born 1953), retired American Olympic gold medalist in swimming", "*John Murphy (cyclist) (born 1984), American professional cyclist", "*John Murphy (sportscaster), American football announcer for the Buffalo Bills", "*John Murphy (footballer, born 1976), English footballer", "*John Murphy (soccer) (born 2000), American soccer player", "*John Murphy (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer", "*John Murphy (hurler), Irish hurler", "*John Murphy (Down Gaelic footballer) (1948\u20132020) Irish Gaelic footballer, manager, coach and selector", "*John Murphy (Gaelic footballer) (?\u20132009), Irish Gaelic footballer", "*John Murphy (bellfounder) (fl. 1837\u20131879), Irish bellfounder", "*John Murphy (sanatorium operator) (1912\u20131977), nicknamed Dropkick, American sanatorium operator and namesake of the band Dropkick Murphys", "*John Murphy (contractor) (1913\u20132009), British building contractor", "*Joe Murphy (contractor) (1917-2000), Irish civil engineering contractor, brother of the above and born John Murphy", "*John Murphy (playwright) (1929\u20131998), Irish dramatist, author of The Country Boy", "*John Murphy (engineer) (born 1943), credited with inventing ARCNET, the first commercial networking system", "*John Murphy (branding consultant) (born 1946), founder of Interbrand", "*John Murphy (technical analyst) (fl. 1960s\u20132000s), financial market analyst", "*John Murphy (voice actor), English voice actor in The Little Prince", "*John Murphy, a character in The 100", "*John Murphy, a character in The Leftovers"]}, {"page": "East Kerry (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Murphy"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1900 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Murphy"]}, {"page": "John Murphy (Irish Parliamentary Party)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Murphy (Irish Parliamentary Party politician)"]}]}}
