In particular, Pauling introduced the concept of hybridisation, where atomic s and p orbitals are combined to give hybrid sp, sp2, and sp3 orbitals. Hybrid orbitals proved powerful in explaining the molecular geometries of simple molecules like methane (tetrahedral with an sp3 carbon). However, slight deviations from these ideal geometries became apparent in the 1940s. A particularly well known example is water, where the angle between hydrogens is 104.5\u00b0, far less than the expected 109.5\u00b0. To explain such discrepancies, it was proposed that hybridisation can result in orbitals with unequal s and p character. A. D. Walsh described in 1947 a relationship between the electronegativity of groups bonded to carbon and the hybridisation of said carbon. Finally, in 1961, Bent published a major review of the literature that related molecular structure, central atom hybridisation, and substituent electronegativities  and it is for this work that Bent's rule takes its name."]}, {"page": "Arthur Walsh", "response": ["*A.
