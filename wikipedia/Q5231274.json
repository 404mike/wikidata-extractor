Bell was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\nHe was approximately 22 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Andaman Islands Expedition when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. The VC was not awarded for bravery in action against the enemy, but for bravery at sea in saving life in storm off Andaman Islands.\nOn 7 May 1867 at the island of Little Andaman, eastern India, in the Bay of Bengal, Private Bell was one of a party of five (the others being James Cooper, Campbell Mellis Douglas, William Griffiths and Thomas Murphy) of the 2/24th Regiment, who risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through dangerous surf to rescue some of their comrades who had been sent to the island to find out the fate of the commander and seven of the crew, who had landed from the ship Assam Valley and were feared murdered by the cannibalistic islanders.\nThe citation was gazetted on 17 December 1867:\n\nTHE Queen has been graciously pleased to signify Her intention to confer the decoration of the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned Officer and Private Soldiers of Her Majesty's Army, whose claims to the same have been submitted for Her Majesty's approval, for their gallant conduct at the Little Andaman Island, as recorded against their names, viz. :\u2014\n\n2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment: Assistant-Surgeon Campbell Millis Douglas, M.D, Private Thomas Murphy, Private James Cooper, Private David Bell, Private William Griffiths.\n\nFor the very gallant and daring manner in which, on the 7th of May, 1867, they risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through a dangerous surf to the rescue of some of their comrades, who formed part of an expedition which had been sent to the Island of Little Andaman, by order of the Chief Commissioner of British Burmah, with the view of ascertaining the fate of the Commander and seven of the crew of the ship \" Assam Valley,\" who had landed there, and were supposed to have been murdered by the\nnatives.\n\nThe officer who commanded the troops on the occasion reports : About an hour later in the day Dr. Douglas, 2nd Battalion, 24th\n.\"Regiment, and the four Privates referred\" to, gallantly manning the second gig, made their way through the surf almost to the shore, but finding their boat was half filled with water, they retired. A second attempt made by Dr. Douglas and party proved successful, five of us being safely passed through the surf to the boats outside. A third and last trip got the whole of the party left on shore safe to the boats. It is stated that Dr. Douglas accomplished these trips through the surf to the shore by no ordinary exertion. He stood in the bows of the boat, and worked her in an intrepid and seamanlike manner, cool to a degree, as\nif what he was then doing was an ordinary act of every-day life. The four Privates behaved in an equally cool and collected manner, rowing through the roughest surf when the slightest hesitation or want of pluck on the part of any one of them would have been\nattended by the gravest results. It is reported that seventeen officers and men were thus saved from what must otherwise have been a fearful risk, if not certainty of death.\n\nHe later achieved the rank of sergeant, and died Gillingham, Kent, 7 March 1920. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh in Brecon, Powys, Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gillingham, Kent", "response": ["*David Bell \u2013 Victoria Cross recipient"]}, {"page": "David Bell", "response": ["David Bell may refer to:", "* David Bell (university administrator) (born 1959), Scottish academic administrator and civil servant", "* David Bell (philosopher) (born 1947), British philosopher", "* David Bell (artist) (1915\u20131959), British curator and writer", "* David Bell (historian) (born 1961), American historian of France", "* David Bell (author) (born 1969), American author and professor", "* David Bell (golfer) (born 1880), Scottish golfer", "* David Bell (field hockey) (born 1955), Australian field hockey player and coach", "* David Bell (baseball) (born 1972), Former American baseball player and current manager of the Cincinnati Reds", "* David Bell (basketball) (born 1981), American basketball player", "* David Bell (sportsman) (born 1949), Scottish rugby union and cricket representative", "* David Bell (footballer, born 1985), Irish footballer", "* David Bell (footballer, born 1984), Irish footballer", "* David Bell (Australian footballer) (1890\u20131961), Australian rules footballer", "* David Bell (American football) (born 2000), American football wide receiver", "* David Bell (Australian politician) (1828\u20131894), New South Wales politician", "* David Bell (Irish Republican) (1818-1890)", "* David Bell (television executive) (1937\u20131990), Scottish television producer and director", "* David Bell (VC) (1845\u20131920), Irish soldier", "* David Bell (composer) (born 1954), American composer", "* David Bell (publisher) (born 1946), American publisher", "* David Belle (born 1973), French actor, film choreographer, and stunt coordinator"]}, {"page": "James Cooper (VC)", "response": ["On 7 May 1867 at the island of Little Andaman, eastern India, in the Bay of Bengal, Private Cooper was one of a party of five (David Bell, Campbell Mellis Douglas, William Griffiths, Thomas Murphy) of 2/24th Regiment.
