These in turn spawned imitators from across Europe and the U.S. The sample montage craze would soon burn itself out, since many of the later records relied heavily on recycling the same samples already heard on the aforementioned hits. Litigation would also play its part, and the adage \"Where there's a hit \u2014 there's a writ\" was coined as both house and hip hop artists underwent a period of legal trouble for using unlicensed samples in their recordings. The sampling style was also being parodied, notably by Star Turn on 45 (Pints) with their UK number 12 hit \"Pump Up the Bitter\", and by Harry Enfield's \"Loadsamoney\" single (produced by a young William Orbit).
