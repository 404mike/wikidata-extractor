A major figure in it was William Allen, another Quaker, who acted as treasurer. It went by the name Royal Lancasterian Society. According to Henry Dunn, writing in 1848, the others on the initial committee were William Corston, Joseph Foster (of Bromley), Joseph Fox, John Jackson and Thomas Sturge.

Using Plough Court for meetings, he also co-founded the Askesian Society.

A second laboratory was opened for the development of new chemicals, a few miles away in Plaistow.", "Allen was approached to help fund the ideas of Joseph Lancaster and his monitorial system, under which one teacher supervised several senior pupils, who in turn instructed many junior ones. In 1808 Allen, Joseph Fox and Samuel Whitbread co-founded the Society for Promoting the Lancasterian System for the Education of the Poor, from 1814 the British and Foreign School Society. In 1810 Allen became treasurer of the Society, whose aim was to open progressive schools in England and abroad."]}, {"page": "British and Foreign School Society", "response": ["The Society for Promoting the Lancasterian System for the Education of the Poor was formed in 1808 to continue Lancaster's lead. The Society was founded by Joseph Fox, William Allen and Samuel Whitbread. It was supported by several evangelical and non-conformist Christians, including William Wilberforce. In 1814, the Society was renamed the British and Foreign School Society for the Education of the Labouring and Manufacturing Classes of Society of Every Religious Persuasion. During the 19th century, based on non-sectarian principles, the Society started a number of \"British Schools\" and teacher training institutions, which in many places maintained an active rivalry with the \"National Schools\" of the Established Church. It also established schools abroad, helping with the provision of staff and other support."]}, {"page": "William Brodie Gurney", "response": ["Gurney joined with his friend, Joseph Fox, in 1795 and opened a Sunday school at Walworth, of which he in the following year became the secretary. In 1801 he commenced the Maze Pond Sunday school, an establishment almost akin to a ragged school, and here he introduced the Scottish method of catechising in the scriptures. On 13 July 1803 he was present at a public meeting in Surrey Chapel schoolroom, when the \"Sunday School Union\" was established. Of this society he became successively secretary, treasurer, and president, and at the jubilee meeting in 1853 was one of the three surviving original subscribers. In 1805, with other persons, he commenced The Youth's Magazine, a cheap popular periodical, devoted to religious subjects. It was the earliest publication of the kind, and one of the most successful. For ten years Gurney was a joint editor of this work, for thirty years its treasurer, and until his death an occasional contributor exercising some general supervision. A large profit made on it was devoted to educational and missionary institutions. He was a member of the first committee of the London Female Penitentiary, formed in 1807, and was one of the lay preachers who for many years took the Sunday services in that institution."]}, {"page": "History of education in England", "response": ["Prior to the nineteenth century, there were few schools.

In 1811, the Anglican National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church in England and Wales was established.  The schools founded by the National Society were called National Schools. Most of the surviving schools were eventually absorbed into the state system under the Butler Act (1944), and to this day many state schools, most of them primary schools, maintain a link to the Church of England, reflecting their historic origins.
