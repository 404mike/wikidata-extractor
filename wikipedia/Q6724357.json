He was Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury, a judge of the county courts and a Law Member of the Viceroy's Council in India. Chalmers also served as Permanent Under Secretary of State of the Home Office from 1903 to 1908.\nHis mother was Matilda, the daughter of Rev. William Marsh. He was educated at King's College London, and Trinity College, Oxford.Chalmers is best remembered today as the draftsman of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882, and in 1888 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893.  The original Bill was settled by Lord Herschell who introduced it into the House of Lords in 1889, with a view to obtaining criticism of its provisions.  The Bill was referred to a Select committee consisting of Lord Herschell, the Earl of Halsbury, Baron Bramwell and Lord Watson.  The 1893 Act was repealed and re-enacted as the Sale of Goods Act 1979. Sir Mackenzie is also known for drafting the Marine Insurance Act 1906, which is still in force.\nHe was appointed as Chief Justice of Gibraltar in 1894.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Marsh (priest)", "response": ["From 1848 he was an honorary canon of Worcester, and from 1860 to his death rector of Beddington, Surrey. Few men preached a greater number of sermons. His conciliatory manners gained him friends among all denominations. He died at Beddington rectory on 24 August 1864. He was married three times: first, in November 1806, to Maria, daughter of Mr. Tilson\u2014she died 24 July 1833; secondly, on 21 April 1840, to Lady Louisa, third daughter of Charles, first earl of Cadogan\u2014she died in August 1843; thirdly, on 3 March 1848, to the Honourable Louisa Horatia Powys, seventh daughter of Thomas, baron Lilford. Mackenzie Dalzell Chalmers was his grandson. He had five children and the fourth Catherine Marsh lived with him. She would write his biography and before he died she began her success as a published author."]}, {"page": "Marine Insurance Act 1906", "response": ["The Act was drafted by Sir Mackenzie Dalzell Chalmers, who had earlier drafted the Sale of Goods Act 1893. The Act is a codifying act, that is to say, it attempts to collate existing common law and present it in a statutory (i.e. \u201ccodified\u201d) form.  In the event, the Act did more than merely codify the law, and some new elements were introduced in 1906. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 has been highly influential, as it  governs not merely English Law, but it also dominates marine insurance worldwide through its wholesale adoption by other jurisdictions."]}, {"page": "Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (United Kingdom)", "response": ["*Sir Mackenzie Dalzell Chalmers (1902\u20131903).\"Chalmers, Sir Mackenzie Dalzell\", Who Was Who (online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007).
