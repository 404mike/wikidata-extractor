He did not bowl at all that year, although he did score the first of his three half-centuries: 51* against Middlesex near the end of the season.\nHe played much more (11 matches) in 1961, and hit two fifties, the higher of these being the 76 he scored against Glamorgan in late June.\nThat was in fact his penultimate appearance in first-class cricket: his only other game was against Northamptonshire a week later.\nDavies died on 21 December 2013, at the age of 75 from lung cancer. He was married to Marina for fifty years and they had two children.", "link_mentions": []}}
