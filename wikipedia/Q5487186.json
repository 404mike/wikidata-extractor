Nic Bullen was becoming frustrated with the musical direction of the group, and began to lose interest as a whole: as a result, Jim Whiteley was asked to join as bass player. The band played a number of concerts as a four-piece before Justin Broadrick left the group to play the drums for local band Head of David. The group attempted to find a new guitarist by asking Shane Embury (ex-Unseen Terror and a fan of the group) to join and giving a trial period to Frank Healy (ex-Annihilator, later of Cerebral Fix and Sacrilege). After Broadrick's departure, Nic Bullen's dissatisfaction with the musical direction of the group led him to leave the group in December 1986 (in order to focus on his studies in English Literature and Philosophy at university), leaving the group without any of its original members.", "*Frank Healy \u2013 guitars (1986)"]}, {"page": "Scum (Napalm Death album)", "response": ["After the recording sessions, there was tension in the band. Bullen attributed this to the fact that every band member wanted to take over the leading role.Glasper, Trapped in a Scene, pp. 17.  In September 1986, Jim Whiteley joined as bass player while Bullen switched to singing exclusively. This coincided with Bullen's loss of interest in Napalm Death and music more generally.Mundrain, Choosing Death, pp. 33.

The line-up includes its founding members Tam and Damian, as well as Frank Healy (bass) and Spike T. Smith (drums); it is the same line-up that recorded Turn Back Trilobite, the band's last official release in 1989.", "Their second release, Within the Prophecy, which saw the band heading further into thrash metal territory, was recorded in January 1987, again at Rich Bitch Studios with engineer Rob Bruce and producer Mike Ivory. It was released later that year through Under One Flag Records, a subsidiary of Music for Nations, and in the USA by Metal Blade records.  The album was well received although the production was far from perfect, though some of the band's original punk following did not appreciate the group's more metal direction. Frustrated by a general lack of creative talent, Sacrilege underwent a significant line-up change at this juncture, replacing drummer Baker with Paul Brookes, bassist May with Paul Morrisey, and adding rhythm guitarist Frank Healy. After another change in which they replaced Brookes with new drummer Spike T. Smith, the new line-up recorded the band's third album, Turn Back Trilobite, issued in April 1989. This record saw the band moving away from their punk/thrash metal roots into a more doom metal musical direction with touches of folk, something virtually unheard of within the contemporaries of the time. New members Frank and Spike rose naturally to the ambitious project. This period of the band saw them gigging alongside the likes of Candlemass, Girlschool, and Sabbat.  This album, although now regarded as a classic of its day, was met with many puzzled expressions from fans and press alike as the band strayed away from thrash into highly experimental pieces which were difficult for people to pigeon hole (mixing doom metal, folk, multi-layered harmony vocals, extended acoustic pieces, and even touches of jazz).  This was the band's parting shot at that time.", "Shortly after recording Turn Back Trilobite, the band quietly went their separate ways. Damian and Tam grew disillusioned by the restrictions and expectations they felt were heaped upon the band. The pair, who were partners throughout this period, went off to live in a converted bus and have two daughters.  No official statement was ever made regarding the ceasing of the band at this point. The band has since stated that they never officially split up, preferring to say that they took a 25-year rest.  Whilst Bassist Frank Healy went on to eventually join Benediction (after stints in Cerebral Fix and Napalm Death) with whom he still plays, and drummer Spike T Smith joining forces with artists such as Morrissey, The Damned, Steve Ignorant, Conflict, English Dogs, and many others. Guitarist Damian Thompson went on immerse himself into purer forms of 'folk' music, becoming an accomplished wooden flute player within traditional Irish music and taking several extended trips to study classical Indian music in India.  Sacrilege are today cited by many people as being ahead of their time during the 1980s in terms of their sound. They are now recognized as a major influence on many later bands and for being unafraid to use musical and idealistic experimentation within the confines of a certain musical genre, even to the detriment of greater commercial appeal.  The band has thus maintained a strong underground following amongst its fans.  Several unofficial and sometimes poor quality bootleg releases of the band's back catalogue and early demos have appeared during their long absence much to the disappointment of founder members Damian Thompson and Lynda 'Tam' Simpson (who between them wrote the entirety of the group's musical and lyrical content).[ Sacrilege biography @ Allmusic]"]}, {"page": "Frank Healey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Healy"]}, {"page": "Tower of Spite", "response": ["The DIY skate/thrash/grindcore approach of the previous outing had been consigned to history and the band started afresh with an effort which was more composed, both musically and in terms of production quality \u2013 as would be expected from a switch to a major label.
