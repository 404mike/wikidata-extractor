Ahead of the Football League Trophy visit to York City in January 2001, McMahon agreed with manager Gary Bennett's suggestion that he had not been at his best; he responded by producing a run that forced a York defender to bring him down for a penalty kick, and then, collecting the ball from a throw-in with his back to goal on the edge of York's penalty area, he \"turned and sent a left-foot curler past the outstretched hand\" of the goalkeeper for Darlington's third goal. As the club brought in other forwards during the season, including David Brightwell, Steve Harper and Clint Marcelle, McMahon lost his place. His last of eleven appearances in all competitions was on 24 February as a substitute.
