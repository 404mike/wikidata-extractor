Having acquired striker Micky Quinn in November 1992 they continued what had already been a blistering start, with away wins at Tottenham Hotspur (2\u20130) Sheffield Wednesday (2\u20131) and Wimbledon (2\u20131) to add to already impressive home wins against Middlesbrough (2\u20131). By the early autumn the Sky Blues briefly topped the inaugural Premier League and would only lose five league games prior to Christmas. The addition of Micky Quinn to the squad led to further outstanding home wins against Aston Villa (3\u20130) and Liverpool (5\u20131). In February 1993, they won 4-2 against title chasing, big spending Blackburn Rovers. However, a barren final few weeks of the season and a run in that would see back to back games against Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leeds United saw them slip from fifth in the league in February to 15th in the final table. The season finished with a thrilling performance from Ndlovu in a 3\u20133 draw against Leeds United. Ndlovu was a key component throughout the season in Gould's fast pacey front line which included John Williams, Kevin Gallacher (until his departure to Blackburn) and Robert Rosario, who formed a worthy partnership with Micky Quinn. Ndlovu's goal against Norwich City, in a 1\u20131 draw in late September, was a signature piece of Ndlovu flair which earned him the Match of Day 'Goal of the month' competition."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Kevin Gallacher"]}, {"page": "2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)", "response": ["* Kevin Gallacher"]}]}}
