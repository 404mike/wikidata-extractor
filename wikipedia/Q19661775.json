His first season veered between surprise wins at Cork City and champions Dundalk to bad defeats against Bray and a FAI cup exit at struggling Wexford Youths, where Rovers had won 5\u20130 two weeks prior. Still this season was the more encouraging of this period and a top half finish saw them become one of the first League of Ireland clubs invited to take part in the Scottish League Challenge cup. A bad opening day defeat in the 2017 season and resultant poor form led to Robertson\u2019s sacking. Three sides would be automatically relegated as the Premier Division was being reduced to ten teams and this hastened the dismissal. Irish League manager Gerard Lyttle was hired but struggled to move the club out of the relegation zone. The turning point came in a televised August success at runaway leaders Cork City with more victories following, though safety was only assured on the final day of the season.", "* 2015 Dave Robertson"]}, {"page": "David Robertson", "response": ["David or Dave Robertson may refer to:", "*Dave Robertson (Massachusetts politician), state representative", "*Dave Robertson (baseball) (1889\u20131970), baseball player", "*Dave Robertson (football manager) (born 1973), football manager and coach", "*Dave Robertson (political scientist), American political scientist"]}]}}
