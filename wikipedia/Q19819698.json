T.; 24 March 1821 \u2013 30 November 1880) was an English hymnwriter of the Victorian era and author of other sacred poems. She published Woodsorrel, 1856; The Babe and the Princess, 1864; Sunshine and Shadow, 1873; and two little prose works.Threlfall was brought up by an uncle and other relatives as her parents died when she was young. Suffering from poor health during the greater part of her life served to deepen her spiritual faith, and gave her time to write hymns. Her literary and religious accomplishment were lauded after her death in 1880, by such authorities as Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Dean Frederic Farrar, and Bishop Christopher Wordsworth. \"We praise Thee in the morning\" may be taken as a specimen of her style, while her Palm Sunday hymn, \"Hosanna! loud hosanna\", was very popular with children.\n\n", "link_mentions": []}}
