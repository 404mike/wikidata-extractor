This was the first time United had lost consecutive league games all season. They secured a much-needed home win over Salisbury with a late Alfie Potter goal on 5 April, and were boosted by AFC Wimbledon's failure to beat York City on 7th, which meant United were mathematically certain of a play-off place, though their chance of automatic promotion as champions looked to be gone as the end of the season loomed. With the pressure eased, United's form improved as the month progressed; after the Salisbury match they won three of their next four fixtures (beating Altrincham away and Mansfield and Wrexham at home, and drawing at Cambridge). An experimental eleven lost 1\u20130 to Eastbourne, ending a run of 5 matches without conceding, on the last day of the regular season.
