He believed that while Wotanism expounded polytheism for the wider population, those who were members of the Armanist elite were aware of the reality of monotheism. List's Armanism would later be classified as a form of \"Ariosophy\", a term which was coined by Lanz von Liebenfels in 1915. Goodrick-Clarke considered List's ideas to be a \"unique amalgam of nationalist mythology and esotericism\". Religious studies scholar Olav Hammer noted that List's Wotanism \"increasingly came to consist of an original synthesis of his reading of Germanic mythology with Theosophy\". List's early Theosophical influence came largely from the writings of German Theosophist Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth, who had combined Theosophical ideas with his own interpretations of Germanic mythology and emphasis on racial doctrines, thus anticipating Ariosophy. In later work, this Theosophical influence over List's thinking grew, and he began referencing works such as Helena Blavatsky's Die Geheimlehre (\"The Secret Doctrine\") and William Scott-Elliot's The Lost Lemuria in his publications. He expressed the view that Norse mythology accorded with \u2013 and thus proved \u2013 the cosmogonical teachings of Theosophy."]}, {"page": "Vril", "response": ["Some readers have believed the account of a superior subterranean master race and the energy-form called \"Vril\", at least in part; some theosophists, notably Helena Blavatsky, William Scott-Elliot, and Rudolf Steiner, accepted the book as based on occult truth, in part.Strube (2013), 55\u2013123.
