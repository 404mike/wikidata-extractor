The genre has close ties with melodic techno with the differences that mostly characterize the difference between house and techno. Both genres derived from progressive house, while melodic house also draws its roots in the early 2010s deep house scene and thus remains more beat-oriented, retaining house structure. Melodic techno has a more atmospheric and hypnotic sound, with emphasis on arpeggiated minor melodies closely tying it with progressive trance. The tempo of the genres stays around 120 bpm, while melodic techno could be slightly faster sometimes, but usually not higher than 130 bpm. Melodic house artists known to make this genre include Dixon, Solomun, Kidnap Kid, Lane 8, Bicep and CamelPhat. Melodic techno artists are Maceo Plex, Tale of Us, K\u00f6lsch and Boris Brejcha."]}, {"page": "Osheaga Festival", "response": ["Friday: Millimetrik, EC Twins, Carnage, Kidnap Kid, Rudimental, Vilify & Henward, Jets, Baauer, A Tribe Called Red"]}, {"page": "LeeFest", "response": ["Jake Bugg, Slaves, Annie Mac, Jungle, Kate Tempest, Wild Beasts, Wilkinson, Mr Scruff, Maribou State, Crazy P, Parcels, Zak Abel, Oxide & Neutrino, Tom Grennan, Kidnap Kid, Fickle Friends, Pumarosa, Lewis Watson, Keston Cobblers Club, Moxie, Shame"]}, {"page": "Amir Amor", "response": ["On Worthington's advice, they seek out a small existing label.
