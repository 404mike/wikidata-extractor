He was a founder member of the pioneering 1960s-1970s rock band Necromandus, widely hailed as the second Black Sabbath, and by Melody Maker as \"Black Sabbath play Yes\". After Necromandus, Hall collaborated with Ozzy Osbourne's first solo project after leaving Black Sabbath.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Necromandus", "response": ["In 1968, two West Cumbrian bands, Jug and Heaven, broke up. Members from both bands, Barry \"Baz\" Dunnery (lead guitar), Dennis McCarten (bass), Frank Hall (drums), and singer Bill Branch, formed a heavy progressive blues outfit they called Hot Spring Water. They were briefly renamed Taurus before settling on Necromandus after a radio show asked their audience for name suggestions. ", "In early 1973, Necromandus, under Iommi's guidance, recorded the album Orexis of Death at London's Morgan Studio. Iommi also added some guitar to the title track. A deal was arranged with Vertigo and the band began opening for Sabbath as well as Tony Kaye's Badger. Dunnery left the band in 1973, and as a result the album was shelved by Vertigo. Necromandus continued to receive praise and support, with Ozzy Osbourne initially wanting Necromandus's guitarist, bassist and drummer for his Blizzard of Ozz project. Dennis McCarten, Barry Dunnery, and Frank Hall were in fact the Original Blizzard Of Ozz with Osbourne in 1977.", "The only surviving member of the original lineup of Necromandus is Frank Hall: Dennis McCarten died of a kidney illness in December 2004 at the age of 54, and Barry Dunnery (the elder brother of Francis Dunnery) died of cancer on 29 May 2008 at the age of 56. Bill Branch died in June 1995 at the age of 45.  Entry at FamilySearch for William J Branch: born 21 Mar 1950, died Jun 1995.
