He also spent time on loan to Norwich City without appearing for the first team, and played non-league football for St Albans City.During his spell at Sheffield United, Webster broke his leg in two places, an injury re-inflicted by a training-ground tackle by Julian Dicks within weeks of joining West Ham United. Although Webster was able to play again, he chose to retire from the professional game in November 1995 to study physiotherapy. Once qualified, he worked for West Ham United and Gillingham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlton Athletic F.C.", "response": ["|1992|| Simon Webster"]}, {"page": "Linvoy Primus", "response": ["Due to injuries to first team centre backs Simon Webster and Darren Pitcher, Primus made his professional debut against Birmingham City.

New signing Simon Webster had a long-term injury having had his leg broken by Dicks in a training session accident. Fellow new signee Dale Gordon had failed to make the impression on the side his transfer had intended. In a move engineered by West Ham's then-Assistant Manager Harry Redknapp, Dicks was transferred in order to bring in new players. Liverpool manager Graeme Souness, on the recommendation of Redknapp, watched Dicks play in a West Ham match against Swindon Town on 11 September 1993. Souness thought Dicks to be \"my kind of player\"  and signed him for Liverpool that week in a swap deal which involved David Burrows and Mike Marsh moving to West Ham. Extra money received by West Ham from the transfer was used by Redknapp to buy veteran striker, Lee Chapman. Dicks' signing had been part of an effort by Souness to \"toughen up\" the Liverpool team as he had planned to pair him with fellow hard man, Neil Ruddock."]}, {"page": "Charlton Athletic W.F.C.", "response": ["* Head of sports medicine and physiotherapy: Simon Webster"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 in English football", "response": ["11 November 1995: Simon Webster, 31-year-old West Ham United defender, retires after failing to recover from a broken leg suffered in a training ground collision with Julian Dicks."]}, {"page": "List of Charlton Athletic F.C. players", "response": ["|Simon Webster||||DF||1990\u201393||143||7"]}, {"page": "Webster (surname)", "response": ["*Simon Webster (footballer), English  professional footballer", "*Simon Webster (rugby union), Scottish International Rugby Union player"]}, {"page": "Simon Webster", "response": ["Simon Webster may refer to:", "*Simon Webster (rugby union)", "*Simon Webster (footballer)"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Simon Webster||||DF||22||0||3||0||2||0||1||0||28||0"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Simon Webster||||DF||39||1||2||0||3||0||1||0||45||1"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Simon Webster||||DF||41||2||2||0||2||0||45||2"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Simon Webster||||DF||16||1||0||0||0||0||16||1"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Simon Webster||||1985\u20131988||118||4||7||0||7||0||2||0||0||0||134||4"]}]}}
