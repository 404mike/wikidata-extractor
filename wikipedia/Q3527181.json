He was an all-rounder, scoring over 19000 runs and taking over 600 first-class wickets.\nWorthington was born at Bolsover, Derbyshire and went to Netherthorpe Grammar School, Staveley, Derbyshire. He became an electrician with the Bolsover Colliery Company and played for the Colliery Club in the Bassetlaw League. Fred Tate, who was talent-spotting for Derbyshire, saw him and introduced him to the club in 1923.Worthington played his debut for Derbyshire in August 1924 against Nottinghamshire, his only game that year. He scored a duck in his first innings and 12 in his second, but took four wickets in the match. He played three matches in 1925 and from 1926 played for the full season for the rest of his career.\nWorthington was a middle order right-hand batsman and a medium-fast right-arm bowler. In neither role did he often hit the headlines, but his consistency and reliability was big factor in the success that Derbyshire enjoyed through the 1930s. The county, normally one of the weaker English first-class cricket teams, won the County Championship for the only time in its history in 1936, for which each player was awarded with a Gold Watch, engraved with the players name, date and championship title.\nWorthington played Test cricket nine times for England, starting with the New Zealand tour in 1929/30. His greatest success was against India in 1936, when he scored 87 at Old Trafford and 128 at The Oval. In the second game, he shared a fourth wicket partnership of 266 with Wally Hammond that remains a record for Tests between England and India. He then toured Australia and New Zealand with Gubby Allen, but an attempt to turn him into an opener was not a success, and he played no more Test cricket.\nWorthington with Derbyshire stayed for a couple of seasons after the Second World War and then played Minor counties cricket for Northumberland. He was Lancashire coach in the sixties, nurturing players like Harry Pilling. David Lloyd said he used to coach in a trilby, a cravat and a cigarette holder. Lloyd says \u201che ruled the place with a rod of iron, he was feared by the players.\u201dHe was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1937.\nWorthington died at King's Lynn in 1973.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Stan Worthington"]}, {"page": "1936 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Charlie Barnett, Bill Copson, Alf Gover, Vijay Merchant, Stan Worthington "]}, {"page": "Sid Barnes", "response": ["Barnes had come to the attention of the New South Wales selectors by the 1936\u201337 season and was included as twelfth man in the side to play the visiting English side, taking a catch on the boundary to dismiss Stan Worthington.Smith, p. 15.

From 1926, the nucleus of a good team emerged around some doughty batting from Denis Smith, Stan Worthington and George Pope. Pope's bowling and that of his brother Alf, leg spinner Tommy Mitchell and seam bowler Bill Copson took the team to their one and so far only Championship victory in 1936. They won 13 of their 28 matches outright and five on first innings. Worthington, Les Townsend, Smith and Alderman all passed 1,000 runs and Copson and Mitchell took over 100 wickets, with Alf Pope taking 94.

They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson.

During these years, Alderman was able to keep his batting average ticking over and around the 25 mark, and, having played more times during the 1936 season than any other to date, cemented his place in the Derbyshire opening attack, most notably with Test cricketer Stan Worthington and sometime wicket-keeper Harry Storer alongside him. Alderman was also noted for his deep fielding. At The Oval in 1936, Surrey batsman Tom Barling swept a ball from Bill Copson to leg which looked as if it was carrying for six. Alderman sprinted 30 yards round the fine-leg boundary to catch it with his outstretched right hand just above the palings. Wisden pronounced that \"the catch should live in the memories of all those who were present on the Wednesday\".", "In 1937 he had his best batting season, with 1,509 runs at 33.53 which included three centuries.

He bowled 11 overs and took the wickets of Eddie Dawson and Alan Shipman for 21, before rain forced the abandonment of the final day's play.  His second, and final game, was the County Championship clash against Derbyshire again at Bramall Lane, in August.
