Somerset played the two university sides, first Oxford and then Cambridge in consecutive matches in a single week in mid-May. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Somerset started the week at Oxford in some disarray: \"Somerset were in such a plight that they had to complete their side by including four Oxford men,\" it said. Three of the four were certainly Kenneth Blaikie, Louis Wharton and John Frazer \u2013 the first two went on to play other matches for Somerset, but Frazer's county cricket was otherwise for Sussex. It is not clear who the fourth was, but as all the other players in the Oxford match had played before for Somerset, Wisden could have meant Fairbanks-Smith. Either way, he batted at No 10, made 0 and 6, took one catch and did not bowl. Alone of the four Oxford conscripts, Fairbanks-Smith accompanied the Somerset side on to Cambridge, where he was 0 not out at the end of the Somerset first innings and then \"absent\" in the second innings.Cricket Archive has Fairbanks-Smith as \"absent hurt\" in the second innings, but there is no record of any injury and given Somerset's difficulty in raising a side that week he may simply have had to leave before the end of the match.  He did not appear in first-class cricket afterwards."]}]}}
