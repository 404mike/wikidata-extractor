He was a friend and schoolmate of Joyce, Oliver St. John Gogarty, Tom Kettle, and Frank O'Brien (the father of Conor Cruise O'Brien).

On Tuesday 25 April, Dubliner Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, a pacifist nationalist activist, had been arrested by British soldiers. Captain John Bowen-Colthurst then took him with a British raiding party as a hostage and human shield. On Rathmines Road he stopped a boy named James Coade, whom he shot dead. His troops then destroyed a tobacconist's shop with grenades and seized journalists Thomas Dickson and Patrick MacIntyre. The next morning, Colthurst had Skeffington and the two journalists shot by firing squad in Portobello Barracks. The bodies were then buried there. Later that day he shot a Labour Party councillor, Richard O'Carroll. When Major Sir Francis Vane learned of the killings he telephoned his superiors in Dublin Castle, but no action was taken. Vane informed Herbert Kitchener, who told General John Maxwell to arrest Colthurst, but Maxwell refused. Colthurst was eventually arrested and court-martialled in June. He was found guilty of murder but insane, and detained for twenty months at Broadmoor. Public and political pressure led to a public inquiry, which reached similar conclusions.

His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, George Clancy, Tom Kettle, and Francis Sheehy-Skeffington,. While at University College, he was also exposed to the scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas, which continued to have a strong influence on his thought for the rest of his life. Joyce also continued to develop as an author. In 1900, his laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken was published in The Fortnightly Review; it was his first publication. He subsequently sent a fan letter in Norwegian to Ibsen. Inspired by Ibsen's works, Joyce wrote his first play, A Brilliant Career, which he later destroyed. He also translated some of the poetry of Paul Verlaine, an experience that would impact his writing style in the years to come.

Whereas during the Lockout the ICA had been a workers' self-defence militia, Connolly conceived of it as a revolutionary organisation dedicated to the creation of an Irish socialist republic. He had served in the British Army in his youth, and knew something about military tactics and discipline. Other active members in the early days included the Secretary to the Council, Se\u00e1n O'Casey, who tried to have Constance Markievicz expelled for her close associations with the Volunteers, which he considered as being \"inimical\" to the ICA's best interests. Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and O'Casey left the ICA when it became apparent that Connolly had started gravitating towards the radical nationalist group, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). The ICA was grossly under-funded. John Devoy, the prominent Irish-American member of IRB Fenians, believed the existence of \"a land army on Irish soil\" was the most important sign since the founding of the Gaelic League.Dudley Edwards, \"Patrick Pearse\", pp.184-197.; Sean Farrell Moran, \"Patrick Pearse and the Politics of Redemption\", (Washington, DC, 1994); Townshend, p.50. James Connolly, a convinced Marxist socialist and Irish Republican, believed that achieving political change through physical force, in the tradition of the Fenians, was legitimate.

At his trial, it was revealed that he had been a \"particular friend\" of Chapman, and had been drinking heavily since 11 December. Concerned that parallels would be made between this case and the killing of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, the British Cabinet directed that Hart should be examined by at least two medical experts, a highly unusual intervention. These medical witnesses testified that Hart was insane at the time of the murders and the court-martial concluded that he \"was guilty of the offenses with which he was charged, but was insane at the time of their commission\".
