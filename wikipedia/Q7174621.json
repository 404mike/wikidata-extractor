In the late 1960s a new generation emerged and sought to develop a uniquely Albertan style of architecture that responded to the province's landscape and culture.

In lieu of the right angles and rectilinear forms of the former style, Pettick employed flowing curvature and a less formal order. One of the greatest influences on Pettick's design was Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, and specifically Niemeyer's Edif\u00edcio Copan in S\u00e3o Paulo. The Saskatchewan Power Building is also one of the first examples of a new Canadian prairie style of architecture, which would be further developed over the next two decades by architects such as Douglas Cardinal and Peter Hemingway. Pettick chose to colour the building a light tan, similar to that of a prairie field. From above, the curvature of the building can also be seen as symbolic of wind-blown wheat."]}, {"page": "Hemingway, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Hemingway"]}]}}
