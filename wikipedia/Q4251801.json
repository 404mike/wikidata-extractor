On his second appearance, he scored his first senior goal: in the 84th minute, he latched on to a long goalkeeping clearance and \"showed his strength to hold off Jordan Mustoe and bundle it past Simpson into the net\" to put Cheltenham 2\u20131 up, which proved to be a winning lead after Accrington Stanley's Kal Naismith missed a late penalty. He scored again a week later as Cheltenham came back from 2\u20130 down to win at Tranmere Rovers, and further enhanced his \"super-sub\" reputation with a 90th-minute header in the next match to secure a 1\u20130 win against Hartlepool United that took Cheltenham top of the table. Given his first start in the Football League Trophy, he scored Cheltenham's second goal, again with a header, to ensure their progress to the second round at Oxford United's expense. He made his first league start on 13 September, in a 1\u20130 defeat away to Luton Town, and was recalled by Birmingham the following day."]}, {"page": "List of foreign Veikkausliiga players", "response": ["* Jordan Mustoe \u2013 SJK \u2013 2018"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|Jordan Mustoe", "|Jordan Mustoe"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Wigan Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| Jordan Mustoe", "|align=\"left\"|27||DF||Jordan Mustoe"]}, {"page": "Mustoe (surname)", "response": ["*Jordan Mustoe (born 1991), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Belgian football transfers winter 2014\u201315", "response": ["| January 4, 2015 ||  Jordan Mustoe || Free agent ||  Westerlo || NA "]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Jordan Mustoe"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|37||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Jordan Mustoe"]}, {"page": "List of Belgian football transfers summer 2017", "response": ["| End of 2016-17 season ||  Jordan Mustoe ||  Westerlo || Free Agent || Released"]}, {"page": "2018 SJK season", "response": ["| Jordan Mustoe", "|11||||DF||Jordan Mustoe||1||0||1||0||2||0"]}, {"page": "List of foreign League of Ireland players", "response": ["* Jordan Mustoe \u2013 Finn Harps"]}]}}
