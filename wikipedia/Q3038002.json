Once the war broke out, he joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE), but was returned to the Sudan to serve in the famous Gideon Force during the liberation of Ethiopia. After the East African campaign, he served on SOE's planning staff in London, before taking command roles in the Mediterranean Theatre.\nIn political life, he served twice as a Member of Parliament (MP).  He was MP for Banbury from 1945 to 1959, holding three junior ministerial positions from 1953 to 1957.  In particular, he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs through the Suez Crisis in 1956.  Unlike Sir Anthony Nutting, who resigned as Minister of State at the Foreign Office, Dodds-Parker considered it his duty to remain in office even though he did not support the plan for Britain and France to invade Egypt under the pretext of separating the Egyptians from a prearranged invasion by Israel; he was, however, sacked from government in the following year.  He stood down from his seat in the House of Commons in 1959, but returned to Parliament as MP for Cheltenham from 1964 to 1974.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "response": ["|Douglas Dodds-Parker", "|Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "Banbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1945 || Douglas Dodds-Parker || Conservative"]}, {"page": "Cheltenham (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Douglas Dodds-Parker"]}, {"page": "Third Churchill ministry", "response": ["|Douglas Dodds-Parker||11 November 1953 \u2013 18 October 1954||\u00a0", "|Douglas Dodds-Parker||18 October 1954||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "List of members of the European Parliament for the United Kingdom (1973\u20131979)", "response": ["|Sir Douglas Dodds-Parker||Conservative||1 January 1973 \u2013 28 February 1975"]}, {"page": "Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke", "response": ["With the onset of World War II in the Far East and the likelihood that Ceylon would face a military threat from Japan, Goonetilleke was given the additional duty as Civil Defence Commissioner in the War Cabinet of Ceylon, heading the newly formed Civil Defence Department to undertake civil defense preparations. Some civil defence works such as knocking down buildings to create fire breaks in Colombo proved unpopular, but proved to be justified when the Imperial Japanese Navy carried out air raids on Colombo and other cities in the spring of 1942. In this capacity, Ivor Jennings, Principle of the Ceylon University College, served as Goonetilleke's deputy, and the two worked closely with D. S. Senanayake, the Minister of Agriculture and Lands.
