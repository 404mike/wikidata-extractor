Unlike his comic book incarnation, Constantine is a full-fledged member of the Justice League. He appears in \"Abate and Switch\" where he helps Batman save Superman and Wonder Woman after their powers were temporarily disabled by the remaining Brothers Djinn Abnegazar, Rath, and Nyorlath. During this time, John Constantine had accidentally cast a British accent spell on himself causing Batman to translate it. Batman can understand it, thanks to his genius-level intellect and his life as Bruce Wayne with Alfred. He later joins in the battle with the three Brothers Djinn members and Black Adam. After the four villains were defeated by Shazam and the Justice League, John Constantine sent the four villains through a portal to an unknown location that Batman couldn't get the translation from John Constantine from. In the episode \"Zombie King\", John Constantine is shown fighting Brother Night at the time when Zatanna heads out to help Batman and Swamp Thing fight Solomon Grundy. In the episode \"Trick or Threat\", John Constantine, Batman, Doctor Fate, and Zatanna are turned into children by Klarion the Witch Boy in order to lure them into the House of Mystery and steal the Helmet of Fate. In the episode \"Supernatural Adventures in Babysitting\", John Constantine is called in by Batman to help him and Stargirl fight Klarion the Witch Boy when he gets his hands on the Magdalene Grimore at the time when Stargirl (who mistakes him for a homeless person) was babysitting Professor Anderson's son Timmy. When the Magdalene Grimore is reclaimed and Klarion the Witch Boy is defeated, John Constantine takes possession of the Magdalene Grimore.

When the cursed pirates ambush Dauntless, Gillette, who was left in charge of Dauntless at the time, fights off the cursed pirates with the remainder of his crew before Norrington and his men arrive to reinforce the dwindling resistance against the pirates.

Almost a year later, Disney announced that Depp would be paid $55.5 million for his role, realizing that without him the franchise would be \"dead and buried.\" Geoffrey Rush expressed interest in returning to his role as Barbossa, and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence. Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him \"angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character\", and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes. While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk. Three other actors from the previous films returned, Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Greg Ellis as Lt. Theodore Groves, and Damian O'Hare as Lt. Gilette. Keith Richards also had a cameo, reprising his role as Captain Teague from At World's End; he and Depp tried to persuade Mick Jagger to audition for the part of a pirate elder. Previous cast members Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) and Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) stated that they would not reprise their roles, as they wanted to be involved in different films. They both thought the storyline involving their characters had gone as far as it could. On August 1, 2009, Bill Nighy expressed his desire to return as Davy Jones, who died in the previous film, citing a possibility to resurrect the character, but at the end, his inclusion was scrapped. On February 5, 2010, Mackenzie Crook also announced he would not be reprising his role of Ragetti, stating, \"They haven't asked me. But actually I don't mind that at all.
