He started training at a stable near Louth, Lincolnshire in 1987, and his first winner was Hinari Video at Carlisle.  He has been training in Middleham since 1988 when he purchased Kingsley House (often falsely attributed to be the former home of Charles Kingsley, author of The Water Babies).\nIn 2004 he won the 1,000 Guineas with Attraction. Other successful horses he has trained are Mister Baileys, winner of the 2,000 Guineas, Shamardal, 2004 European Champion Two-Year-Old, and Double Trigger, winner of the Ascot Gold Cup.\nJohnston's horses are known for their front running style and bravery in a finish, two attributes that were best advertised by the exploits of Attraction. He cites Shamardal as the best horse he ever trained, and Attraction as the one he is most proud of.He reached his 4,000th winner on the flat in Britain when Dominating won at Pontefract on Monday 23 October 2017. He is only the third trainer in either code to reach that figure.On 23 August 2018 Mark Johnson became the most successful British Flat Trainer of all time when Frankie Dettori rode Poet's Society to win the 3.00 at York at odds of 20\u20131 to give Mark his 4,194 winner. \nThe motto of the stable is \"Always Trying\".He is married to Deirdre, a former teacher.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing", "response": ["|Mark Johnston"]}, {"page": "2000 Guineas Stakes", "response": ["| Mark Johnston"]}, {"page": "Horse racing in Great Britain", "response": ["The two dominant forces in flat training in Britain in the modern era are Irish-based trainer Aidan O'Brien and Godolphin, through their trainers Saeed Bin Suroor and Charlie Appleby.  They largely concentrate on Group races.  Operating in much larger numbers of runners, but with a greater spread of quality, are trainers such as Mark Johnston, Richard Hannon Jr. and Richard Fahey."]}, {"page": "Middleham", "response": ["Today's Middleham is a centre of horse racing and home to Middleham Trainers' Association. The first racehorse trainer at Middleham was Isaac Cape in 1765. Today there are several, including Mark Johnston, Jedd O'Keefe, James Bethell, and Ben Haslam. Racing is the foremost employer in the town and tourism the second. The castle is a ruin, having been dismantled in 1646, but the keep, built by Robert Fitz Ralph in the 1170s, survives, as do the 13th-century chapel and 14th-century gatehouse."]}, {"page": "Kieren Fallon", "response": ["The 2010 Flat racing season saw Kieren Fallon employed largely by trainers Luca Cumani, Mark Johnston and Kevin Ryan. Although major wins were less frequent, Fallon had success, riding 140 winners in 2010 and 154 in 2011.
