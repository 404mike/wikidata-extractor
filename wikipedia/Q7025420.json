In 1711, Adriaan Reland published a book containing the text of 17th-century writings, five attacking and five defending it. As critical of the use of \"Jehovah\" it incorporated writings by Johannes van den Driesche (1550\u20131616), known as Drusius; Sixtinus Amama (1593\u20131629); Louis Cappel (1585\u20131658); Johannes Buxtorf (1564\u20131629); Jacob Alting (1618\u20131679). Defending \"Jehovah\" were writings by Nicholas Fuller (1557\u20131626) and Thomas Gataker (1574\u20131654) and three essays by Johann Leusden (1624\u20131699). The opponents of \"Jehovah\" said that the Tetragrammaton should be pronounced as \"Adonai\" and in general do not speculate on what may have been the original pronunciation, although mention is made of the fact that some held that Jahve was that pronunciation."]}, {"page": "Crookham, Berkshire", "response": ["In 1445 the sub-manor of Chamberhouse was formed.
