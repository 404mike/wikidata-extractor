Digger objections and minor riots led to Governor Barkly's visit to New Rush in September the following year, when he revealed a plan instead to have Griqualand West proclaimed a Crown Colony. Richard Southey would arrive as Lieutenant-Governor of the intended Crown Colony in January 1873. Months passed however without any sign of the proclamation or of the promised new constitution and provision for representative government. The delay was in London where Secretary of State for the Colonies, John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley, insisted that before electoral divisions could be defined, the places had to receive \"decent and intelligible names. His Lordship declined to be in any way connected with such a vulgarism as New Rush and as for the Dutch name, Vooruitzigt \u2026 he could neither spell nor pronounce it.\" The matter was passed to Southey who gave it to his Colonial Secretary J.B. Currey. Roberts writes that \"when it came to renaming New Rush, [Currey] proved himself a worthy diplomat. He made quite sure that Lord Kimberley would be able both to spell and pronounce the name of the main electoral division by, as he says, calling it 'after His Lordship'.\" New Rush became Kimberley, by Proclamation dated 5 July 1873.  Digger sentiment was expressed in an editorial in the Diamond Field newspaper when it stated \"we went to sleep in New Rush and waked up in Kimberley, and so our dream was gone.\""]}, {"page": "Griqualand West", "response": ["* Administrator and then Lieutenant Governor Richard Southey (10 January 1873 \u2013 3 August 1875)"]}, {"page": "British diaspora in Africa", "response": ["*Richard Southey (1808\u20131901), Colonial Secretary and Treasurer, Lieutenant-Governor of Griqualand-West"]}, {"page": "1873 in South Africa", "response": ["* Lieutenant-Governor of Griqualand West: Sir Richard Southey (from 17 July).The British Empire: Griqualand West Administrators (Accessed on 16 April 2017)", "* 17 \u2013 Sir Richard Southey becomes the first Lieutenant-Governor of Griqualand West."]}, {"page": "1874 in South Africa", "response": ["* Lieutenant-Governor of Griqualand West: Sir Richard Southey.The British Empire: Griqualand West Administrators (Accessed on 16 April 2017)"]}, {"page": "1875 in South Africa", "response": ["* Lieutenant-Governor of Griqualand West: Richard Southey (until 3 August) William Owen Lanyon (until 3 August)."]}, {"page": "Xhosa Wars", "response": ["Originally assured of his personal safety during the treaty negotiations, Hintsa rapidly found himself held hostage and pressured with massive demands for cattle \"restitution\". Other sources say he offered himself as a hostage until the indemnity was paid and even suggested that he accompany Colonel Smith in collecting Xhosa cattle. He attempted to escape at the Nqabarha River but was pursued, pulled off his horse, and immobilized with shots through the back and the leg. Immediately, a soldier named George Southey (brother of colonial administrator Sir Richard Southey) came up behind Hintsa and shot him in the back of the head; furthermore, Hintsa's ears were cut off after his death. Other sources say his horse bolted and Harry Smith tried to shoot the fleeing man but both his pistols misfired. Giving chase, he caught hold of Hintsa and dragged him heavily to the ground. Hintsa was still full of fight. \"He was jabbing at me furiously with his assegai,\" Colonel Smith recalled in his autobiography, and the king succeeded in breaking away to find cover in a nearby stream bed. There, while pleading for mercy, the top of his skull was blown off by one of Smith's officers and his body was afterwards mutilated by British and colonial troops. These actions shocked the government in London, which condemned and repudiated Governor D\u2019Urban.
