He was an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, the eldest son of George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan by his wife Kaitlin Dawson. Lucan was an evacuee during the Second World War but returned to attend Eton College, and served with the Coldstream Guards in West Germany from 1953 to 1955. Having developed a taste for gambling, he became skilled at backgammon and bridge, and was an early member of the Clermont Club. Lucan's losses often exceeded his winnings, yet he left his job at a London-based merchant bank and became a professional gambler. He was known as Lord Bingham from April 1949 until January 1964, during his father's lifetime.", "Richard John Bingham was born on 18 December 1934 at 19 Bentinck Street, Marylebone, London, the second child and elder son of George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan, an Anglo-Irish peer, and his wife Kaitlin Elizabeth Anne Dawson. A blood clot found in his mother's lung forced her to remain in a nursing home, so John, as he became known, was initially cared for by the family's nurserymaid, Lucy Sellers. Aged three years, he attended a pre-prep school in Tite Street with his elder sister Jane. In 1939, with war approaching, the two were taken to the relative safety of Wales."]}, {"page": "Lucan (disambiguation)", "response": ["*George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan"]}, {"page": "George Bingham", "response": ["*George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan (1898\u20131964), British Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations"]}, {"page": "George Charles Patrick Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan "]}, {"page": "Bingham (surname)", "response": ["**George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan (1898\u20131964)"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst", "response": ["* George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan"]}, {"page": "Lord Bingham (disambiguation)", "response": ["*George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan (1898\u20131964), known as Lord Bingham from 1914 to 1949"]}]}}
