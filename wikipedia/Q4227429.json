He first attracted public attention by his performance, on 5 February 1842, of Damon on the production of Acis and Galatea (Handel) under William Macready at Drury Lane. In John Edmund Cox's Musical Recollections, he is identified as \"the only person worth listening to, in spite of the limited powers of his organ\".. In 1843, under the same management, he played Acis and Phaon in Giovanni Pacini's opera Saffo, when the heroine on each occasion was Clara Novello, and later in the autumn he played at the Princess's Theatre as Edward III in the English version of Balfe's Le Puits d'Amour."]}, {"page": "John Edmond Cox", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Edmund Cox"]}]}}
