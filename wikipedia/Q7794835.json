Thomas Walker Horsfield FSA (christened 2 December 1792, Sheffield - 26 August 1837, Chowbent, Lancashire), was an English Nonconformist minister, topographer, and historian best known for his works The History and Antiquities of Lewes (1824-26) and The History, Antiquities and Topography of the County of Sussex (1835).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lewes", "response": ["During the Roman period there was an aristocratic villa at Beddingham,Russell, M., 2006: Roman Sussex. Tempus. pp. 166\u2013169. at the foot of Mount Caburn, and there have been several finds of Roman coins and pottery sherds in Lewes itself. The Victorian historian Thomas Walker Horsfield therefore reckoned that there must have been a Roman settlement on the site, and he identified it with the otherwise unlocatable town of Mutuantonis. Another antiquarian, John Elliot, even suggested that central Lewes's distinctive network of twittens was based on the layout of a Roman legionary fortress; however modern historians are rather more cautious about the possibility of a Roman Lewes, as there is as yet no archaeological evidence for a built-up area dating back to the Roman period."]}, {"page": "Withyham", "response": ["Withyham was also home to the Gildredge family, who later moved to Eastbourne, acquiring a large share of the town's land by purchase and through marriage. \"Gildredge House and estate was formerly the property and residence of the family of the same name,\" says Thomas Walker Horsfield in his history of Sussex, \"who afterwards (temp. Henry VIII) removed to and became lords of the manor of Eastbourne.\" Today's Gildredge Park in Eastbourne is named after the family.

In 1821, most of this land was turned into a graveyard.  It replaced the original burial ground, which was full by 1760, and a small private plot \"scarcely larger than the space covered by a small room\" which had been created soon afterwards for the Browne family.  This is on the other side of The Twitten from the main graveyard.  The oldest headstones in the original part of the burial ground date from 1730 and 1731.  In 1815\u201316, some of the Gunsfield land had been used by Robert Chatfeild junior's sons John and Robert to build a pair of single-sex schools.  They were Free Schools, funded by contributions from the chapel congregation and other donations.  The boys' school was finished in 1815, and the girls' building was ready the year after.  They were initially successful\u2014Thomas Walker Horsfield noted that \"at one time half the people of Ditchling were educated there\"\u2014but by the 1830s they were struggling financially, partly due to the sudden death of the rector of Westmeston who had been a major financial supporter.  Both schools closed in about 1836, when a National School (not associated with the chapel) was opened elsewhere in the village.  The cottage of 1672, a timber-framed and wattle and daub building, was extended on its south side in 1808.  The new section, taller than the original building, was built of brick and tiles.  It housed the Elder of the chapel, who later became the schoolmaster."]}, {"page": "Henry Michell Wagner", "response": ["Under Wagner's guidance, Brighton's parish church was also rebuilt from its state of \"sad disrepair\" in 1853\u201354 to the design of Richard Cromwell Carpenter.
