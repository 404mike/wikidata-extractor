He served in British Parliament as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tralee from 1832 to 1837, and from 1838 until his death.\nO'Connell attended Miss Everina Wollstonecraft's school, Dublin, in 1810, Edward Whyte's school, Dublin, in 1813, Clongowes Wood College in 1815, Trinity College, Dublin, in 1819, and King's Inns in 1821.In 1832 he married Mary, daughter of Bindon Scott of County Clare, and they had several  children. The marriage was unhappy and Maurice is said to have had numerous affairs; some of the stories of his father's womanising are said to be based on Maurice's actions. His conduct, combined with chronic ill-health, wrecked his political career. Though described as \"frank, popular and enthusiastic\" he never lived up to the hopes his father and others had for him.\nIn 1834 he held the position of Director of the National Bank of Ireland.His brothers John, Morgan and Daniel were also MPs.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
