He served in British Parliament as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tralee from 1832 to 1837, and from 1838 until his death.\nO'Connell attended Miss Everina Wollstonecraft's school, Dublin, in 1810, Edward Whyte's school, Dublin, in 1813, Clongowes Wood College in 1815, Trinity College, Dublin, in 1819, and King's Inns in 1821.In 1832 he married Mary, daughter of Bindon Scott of County Clare, and they had several  children. The marriage was unhappy and Maurice is said to have had numerous affairs; some of the stories of his father's womanising are said to be based on Maurice's actions. His conduct, combined with chronic ill-health, wrecked his political career. Though described as \"frank, popular and enthusiastic\" he never lived up to the hopes his father and others had for him.\nIn 1834 he held the position of Director of the National Bank of Ireland.His brothers John, Morgan and Daniel were also MPs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Daniel O'Connell", "response": ["O'Connell seemed implicitly to concede the separateness of the Protestant North. He spoke \"invading\" Ulster to rescue \"our Persecuted Brethren in the North\". In the event, and in the face of the hostile crowds that disrupted his one foray to Belfast in 1841 (\"the Repealer repulsed!\"), he \"tended to leave Ulster strictly alone\".Foster, p. 306 Perhaps persuaded by their presence through much of the south as but a thin layer of officials, landowners and their agents, O'Connell proposed Protestants had not the staying power of true \"religionists\". Their ecclesiastical dissent (and not alone their unionism) was a function, he argued, of political privilege. To Dr Paul Cullen (the future Cardinal and Catholic Primate of Ireland) in Rome, O'Connell wrote:The Protestants of Ireland... are political Protestants, that is, Protestants by reason of their participation in political power... If the Union were repealed and the exclusive system abolished, the great mass of the Protestant community would with little delay melt into the overwhelming majority of the Irish nation. Protestantism would not survive the Repeal ten years.O'Connell to Cullen, 9 May 1842. Maurice O'Connell (ed.) The Correspondence of Daniel O'Connell.
