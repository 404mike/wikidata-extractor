Amy Steel, who starred as heroine Ginny Field in Friday the 13th Part 2, co-starred with Peter Barton on the TV series The Powers of Matthew Star. Barton was offered the role of Doug when the series was cancelled, but he was initially reluctant as he wanted no part in any horror film, especially after he disliked working on Hell Night.
