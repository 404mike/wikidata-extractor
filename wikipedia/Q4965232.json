On publication it went to the number one slot on the Indian non-fiction section best seller list. Hirsh Sawhney, writing in The Guardian, admires the book's 'awareness of the world's innate cosmopolitanism' and 'remarkably diverse array of characters'. He calls Nine Lives a 'compelling and poignant' work, but believes that Nine Lives does not challenge the partitioning of the world into 'anachronistic, seemingly irreconcilable compartments' like the author's other works. Brian Schofield in The Sunday Times acknowledges the power and humanity of Dalrymple's portraits, calling them the work of \"a towering talent\" but also remarks on its narrow focus. In contrast, Pico Iyer, in TIME Magazine, praises the \"powerful restraint and clarity\" the book brings to \"precisely the two subjects \u2014 India and faith \u2014 that cause most observers to fly off into cosmic vagueness or spleen. The result is a deeply respectful and sympathetic portrait.\" The distinguished Sanskritist  Wendy Doniger also raved about the book in a cover story for the Times Literary Supplement: \"Dalrymple vividly evokes the lives of these men and women, with the sharp eye and good writing that we have come to expect of his extraordinary travel books about India..  A glorious mixture of journalism, anthropology, history, and history of religions, written in prose worthy of a good novel, not since Kipling has anyone evoked village India so movingly. Dalrymple can conjure up a lush or parched landscape with a single sentence.\""]}, {"page": "The Sunday Times Travel Magazine", "response": ["* 2003: Brian Schofield"]}, {"page": "Schofield, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Schofield"]}]}}
