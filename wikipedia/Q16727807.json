The Trainspotter caricature was supposedly based on the man pictured on the cover of Issue 1 of Your Spectrum. As with the Jugglers, this was drawn by Nick Davies.

It was a lot of fun, although I found myself questioning some of the gameplay choices.\" The two versions of the game, for the PC and the Amiga, were developed separately and simultaneously, in order to make the best possible product for each platform rather than a quick port from one system to another. A version for the Amiga CD32 had also been planned. The game mixes backgrounds hand-drawn with acrylic paint and then digitized by Mohr, and sprite bitmap graphics made in Deluxe Paint and Brilliance on the Amiga with some rotoscoped animations. The animators Billy Allison and Stuart Atkinson created \"huge\" DPaint-made character sequences but they had to implement them in game in more efficient way due to computer memory limitations.Stuart Campbell, \"Things to come: Curse of Enchantia\". Amiga Power 17 (September 1992), page 20. In addition, the PC version used the full 8-bit color of a 256-color palette, but the Amiga version had to be downscaled to only 32 colors (including 24 colors for the background and eight colors for the main character; the other characters had to be drawn with these colors).\"Life, Core Design and everything\", The One Amiga (January 1994), pages 36-37. The game also uses various digitized sound effects.Amazing Computer Magazine Volume 8 Issue 3 (June 1993), pages 83-84.", "Allison described the projects as a \"zany Pythonesque take on the classic fairy tales.\" The game's story and elements were partially inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The Snow Queen, and Disney animated films, and relies heavily on surreal humor and slapstick. It contains several Easter egg pop culture references, including the shop called \"Benn's Costume Shop\" complete with a costume of Batman, a band named \"The Slugs\" consisting of four humanoid slugs, getting into a frozen realm through a wardrobe, and encountering the wreck of Marie Celeste. Other connections might be accidental, such as its likeness to Lure of the Temptress, another fantasy adventure game that was developed at the same time (released in June 1992). Stuart Campbell, who described as Curse of Enchantia as \"a funny version of Lure of the Temptress with a different plot,\" was not the only one who noted the two games' similarities to each other, especially regarding the initial dungeon-escape scenes in both games. As written in adventure gaming magazine Red Herring, \"obvious similarities abound as you find that: 'the downtrodden villagers are praying for a return to a peaceful life, and the death of the evil one', which Is pretty much what they are doing in Lure of the Temptress.\""]}, {"page": "Dangerous Streets", "response": ["The game was derided by critics.

Virgin Interactive initially defended the use of the poppy as an anti-war statement, which the Daily Star in turn dismissed as a \"publicity writer's hypocrisy\". Magazine Amiga Power became involved in the controversy because of its planned reuse of the poppy on the cover of an issue also to be released on Armistice Day. This had been changed in response to criticism in the Daily Star original article, but the newspaper published another piece focussing on a perceived inflammatory retort by Amiga Power editor Stuart Campbell: \"Old soldiers? I wish them all dead.\" The article featured further quotes from the British Legion. The magazine apologised for including the comment although Campbell himself felt he was \"entitled to an opinion\" regardless of its insensitivity. The game was ultimately released with a soldier rather than a poppy on the box art, though the poppy was still displayed on the game's title screen. Amiga Power also changed its cover after \"legal scrapes with the British Legion over whether a poppy is just a flower or a recognisable symbol of a registered charity.\" Stuart Campbell elsewhere pointed out that the game was ironically anti-war, while contemporary Amiga Format reviewer Tim Smith also praised the game as intelligently anti-war. Metro later acknowledged \"a relatively profound statement on the futility of war\" which had been unrecognised by the Daily Star. Kieron Gillen defended the game as ironic and anti-war in a retrospective.
