He worked at Madame Tussauds museum as a wax figure sculptor but left when his brother John Theodore Tussaud became chief artist and manager of the museum after a limited company was formed in 1888 and sold in 1889. The main shareholder was Edwin Josiah Poyser.\nLouis Tussaud created a waxwork museum in London, 207 Regent Street, which opened 24 December 1890. The Regent Street waxwork museum was destroyed in a fire on 20 June 1891. He moved to Blackpool in 1900. He first set up a waxworks in Blackpool in the basement of the Hippodrome Theatre, Church Street, opening it in July 1900. The following year, he moved the exhibition to the Brunswick Caf\u00e9, South Shore. In 1929 the Louis Tussaud's Waxworks opened on Central Promenade. It was closed in 2010 and re-opened as Madame Tussauds in 2011.\nLouis Tussaud wax museums were later established in Atlantic City; Belle Vue, Greater Manchester; Brighton (1937-1979); Copenhagen (1974-2007); Great Yarmouth and St. Petersburg, Florida. There was a Louis Tussaud shakespearian waxworks in Stratford from 1971 to 1983.\nOther Louis Tussaud's wax museums owned by Ripley Entertainment are in:\n\nNiagara Falls, Ontario, Canada\nSan Antonio, Texas, USA\nGrand Prairie, Texas, USA\nNewport, Oregon, USA \nBangalore-Innovative Film City, India\nPattaya, ThailandLouis Tussaud's museums are not connected to his great-grandmother's Madame Tussauds wax museum nor to the Josephine Tussaud's (1900\u20131985) wax museum in Hot Springs, Arkansas.\nLouis Tussauds, Blackpool, (which was temporarily owned by Leisure Parcs) was bought out by Blackpool Council.

Adam, Consummatum Est, Jacob and the Angel and Genesis, and other works, were initially displayed in an old drapery shop surrounded by red velvet curtains. The crowds were ushered in at the cost of a shilling by a barker on the street. After a small tour of American fun fairs, the works were returned to Blackpool and were exhibited in the anatomical curiosities section of Louis Tussaud's waxworks. The works were displayed alongside dancing marionettes, diseased body parts and conjoined (\"Siamese\") twin babies in jars. Placing Epstein within the context of freakish curiosity perhaps added to Epstein's decision not to create further large-scale direct carvings."]}, {"page": "List of Have I Got News for You episodes", "response": ["|2 November 2012The show ended in a 6\u20136 draw, so a quickfire tiebreak round was played where the panel had to identify the waxworks of the Louis Tussaud museum in Great Yarmouth, which had featured as a news item earlier in the show as it was facing closure.

In September 2000, the museum left its original location towards the bottom of the hill, opening in a new location just above the hill on Victoria Avenue in 2005. The museum, the largest wax museum in Canada, imitates the wax museums of Louis Tussaud's great-grandmother Madame Tussaud, as the figures are placed within reach of its visitors. Figures represented in the museum include actors, music artists, politicians, fictional characters from film and television, and historical figures.", "Located at the bottom of Clifton Hill, across the street from the original Louis Tussauds, is the Movieland Wax Museum of the Stars, which displays celebrities from movies, music, and television. Unlike Louis Tussauds, where most of the figures are placed together in large galleries, the majority of the figures displayed here are in contained displays decorated to resemble famous movie scenes, and are dressed as their respective fictional characters. Most of the figures are behind glass or out of reach. At the end of the museum is an interactive hall of horrors that acts as a small haunted house attraction, complete with a mirror maze, animatronic figures, and a mechanical replica of an electric chair that shakes and blows smoke. The museum's exit formerly ushered visitors into a wax hand studio and gift shop, which was removed during the COVID-19 lockdown. In 2005, the museum relocated out of what is now the glow-in-the-dark Wizard's Golf miniature golf to its present, larger location, which had been home to the now-closed Circus World arcade and gift shop from 1984 until 2001.
