Kelly was first choice during Bohemians' UEFA Champions League campaign in 2003 but never made the goalkeeping spot his own during his time at Dalymount Park. Kelly joined Longford Town from Bohs in 2005 and played a crucial role in the club's FAI Cup run in 2007 and also their gallant battle against relegation that same season. Following a mass exodus of players at the end of that season, Kelly remained on as one of only three players for the 2008 season (the others being Daire Doyle and Alan O'Riordan) as then manager Aaron Callaghan attempted to assemble a squad almost from scratch. Due to persistent back problems, Kelly retired during the summer of 2008.
