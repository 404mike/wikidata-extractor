Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids) such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float."]}, {"page": "July 7", "response": ["*1934 \u2013 Robert McNeill Alexander, British zoologist (died 2016)"]}, {"page": "Trinity Hall, Cambridge", "response": ["* Robert McNeill Alexander, CBE, FRS - Zoologist "]}, {"page": "1934 in science", "response": ["* July 7 \u2013 Robert McNeill Alexander (died 2016), British zoologist, authority on animal locomotion."]}, {"page": "Lisburn", "response": ["* Robert McNeill Alexander (1934\u20132016) \u2013 zoologist"]}, {"page": "Zoological Society of London", "response": ["*2002 Professor Robert McNeill Alexander, CBE, FRS", "*Professor Robert McNeill Alexander, CBE, FRS (1992\u20131999)"]}, {"page": "1934 in Ireland", "response": ["*7 July \u2013 Robert McNeill Alexander, zoologist, authority on animal locomotion (died 2016)."]}, {"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*1979: Robert McNeill Alexander and P.

These were largely taken from specimen HMN SII, a subadult individual between  in length and about twelve meters (forty feet) tall. The often mentioned length of 22.46 metres is by Werner Janensch, the German scientist who described Giraffatitan, and was the result of a simple adding error: the correct number should have been 22.16 metres. Mass estimates are more problematic and historically have strongly varied from as little as  to as much as . These extreme estimates are now considered unlikely due to flawed methodologies. There are also a large number of such estimations as the skeleton proved to be an irresistible subject for researchers wanting to test their new measuring methods. The first calculations were again made by Janensch. In 1935, he gave a volume of 32 m\u00b3 for specimen SII and of 25 m\u00b3 for specimen SI, a smaller individual. It is not known how he arrived at these numbers. In 1950, he mentioned a weight of forty tonnes for the larger skeleton. In 1962, Edwin Harris Colbert measured a volume of 86.953 m\u00b3. Presuming a density of 0.9, this resulted in a weight of 78,258 kilogrammes. Colbert had inserted a museum model, sold to the public, into sand and observed the volume displaced by it. Gregory S. Paul in 1988 assumed that the, in his opinion, unrealistically high number had been caused by the fact that such models used to be very bloated compared to the real build of the animal. In 1980, Dale Alan Russell et al published a much lower weight of 14.8 tonnes by extrapolating from the diameter of the humerus and the thighbone. In 1985, the same researcher arrived at 29 tonnes by extrapolating from the circumference of these bones. In 1985, Robert McNeill Alexander found a value of 46.6 tonnes inserting a toy model of the British Museum of Natural History into water."]}, {"page": "McNeill (surname)", "response": ["*Robert McNeill Alexander (1934\u20132016), British zoologist"]}, {"page": "List of Old Tonbridgians", "response": ["* Robert McNeill Alexander, CBE, FRS, Professor of Zoology at the University of Leeds "]}, {"page": "Robert MacNeil (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Robert McNeill Alexander (1934\u20132016), British zoologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Robert McNeill Alexander||17/03/1987||7 July 1934\u2013 21 March 2016 UK Zoologist"]}, {"page": "R.
