John Pretyman Newman was one of the founders and became its first Chairman, a position he resigned when he was elected Vice-President on 9 July 1922. Speaking at the meeting when the MCU was relaunched as the National Citizens Union in 1921 Askwith rather pointedly said \"the Union supported the maintenance of representative government and would oppose direct action for political purposes\" (The Times, 19 December 1921).

Early in 1916 the Ottomans claimed that the British had been driven back on to Aden itself, and had retreated to within range of the covering fire of their warships, where they had been inactive for some months. Many of the Ottoman claims were greatly exaggerated, and some wholly false. In February 1916, Major John Pretyman Newman, MP, asked in the British Parliament for any information about the fighting near Aden. Austen Chamberlain, then Secretary of State for India, responded that the Ottoman claim of success which had recently been put forward would seem to have been founded on an engagement which took place on 12 January between a reconnoitring column of the Aden garrison and an Ottoman force in the neighbourhood of Shaikh Othman. The loss on our side was one British officer and thirty-five Indian rank and file killed, and four British and thirty-five Indian rank and file wounded. The enemy losses were severe, amounting to about two hundred killed and wounded. The British column was neither annihilated nor defeated, but withdrew when the purpose of the movement was completed, Chamberlain said."]}, {"page": "Destruction of Irish country houses (1919\u20131923)", "response": ["| Newberry Manor || Mallow || County Cork ||John Pretyman Newman || 3 June 1921 || Rebuilt; now a nursing home"]}, {"page": "Neil Kennedy, Lord Kennedy", "response": ["The landowners' hostility was reflected in the newspapers.
