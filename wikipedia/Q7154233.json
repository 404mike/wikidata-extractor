He became a popular player amongst the Stoke support and scored the winning goal against Peterborough United to see Stoke through to the 1992 Football League Trophy Final where they beat Stockport County 1\u20130. Ware played a major role in 1992\u201393 which saw Stoke win the Second Division title before he was sold to Stockport County in September 1994. Ware then went on to play for Cardiff City, Hednesford Town, Macclesfield Town, Nuneaton Borough, and Rochdale before ending his playing career with a return to Hednesford. After his playing career had ended he battled against a brain tumour and he died on 17 April 2013 aged 42.\nIn 2018 a street was named in his honour on the Victoria Park housing development built on the former Stoke City Football Ground.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 7", "response": ["*  1970   \u2013 Paul Ware, English footballer (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "Sandbach School", "response": ["*Paul Ware, Stoke City footballer"]}, {"page": "Dave Kevan", "response": ["In February 1990, Kevan joined Stoke City under the management of Alan Ball. His debut for Stoke was in the Potteries derby against Port Vale in a 0\u20130 draw at Vale Park on 3 February. Stoke were relegated out of the Second Division at the end of the 1989\u201390 season. He found himself out of the team in 1990\u201391, making eight appearances and spending time out on loan at Maidstone United in the Fourth Division. He failed to make much impact at Watling Street either, featuring just three times for the \"Stones\". New Stoke manager Lou Macari moved Kevan into defence in 1991\u201392 and he played in 57 matches, including in the 1992 Associate Members' Cup Final as City beat Stockport County 1\u20130 at Wembley. However this would be his final season as a key fixture in the first eleven as the following campaign would prove to be very competitive for central midfield places with Paul Ware, Carl Beeston and Steve Foley all in contention.
