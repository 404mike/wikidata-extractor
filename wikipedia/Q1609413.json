The song's transgressive lyrics evaded radio censorship. Though the jazzy arrangement (courtesy of bassist Herbie Flowers and saxophonist Ronnie Ross) was musically atypical for Reed, it eventually became his signature song. It came about as a result of a commission to compose a soundtrack to a theatrical adaptation of Nelson Algren's novel of the same name; the play failed to materialize. \"Walk on the Wild Side\" was Reed's only entry in the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, at No. 16."]}, {"page": "Bassist", "response": ["*Herbie Flowers"]}, {"page": "Lewes", "response": ["Lewes is the birthplace of 16th-century madrigalist Nicholas Yonge.
