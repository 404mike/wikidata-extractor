For instance, sexologist John Money suggests the distinction between biological sex and gender as a role. Moreover, Ann Oakley, a professor of sociology and social policy, says \"the constancy of sex must be admitted, but so also must the variability of gender.\"Oakley, Ann (1972). Sex, Gender and Society. London: Temple Smith. p. 16 . The World Health Organization states, \"'[s]ex' refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women,\" and \"'gender' refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women.\"World Health Organization (2002). \"Gender and Reproductive Rights: Working Definitions\". Retrieved 15 November 2012. Thus, sex is regarded as a category studied in biology (natural sciences), while gender is studied in humanities and social sciences.

Beauvoir had denied being a feminist multiple times but ultimately admitted that she was one after the influential Second Sex became crucial in the world of feminism. The work has had a profound influence, opening the way for second wave feminism in the United States, Canada, Australia, and around the world. Despite the fact that Beauvoir has been quoted as saying \"There is a certain unreasonable demand that I find a little stupid because it would enclose me, immobilize me completely in a sort of feminist concrete block.\" Her works on feminism have paved the way for all future feminists. Founders of the second wave read The Second Sex in translation, including Kate Millett, Shulamith Firestone, Juliet Mitchell, Ann Oakley and Germaine Greer.  All acknowledged their profound debt to Beauvoir, including visiting her in France, consulting with her at crucial moments, and dedicating works to her.  Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book The Feminine Mystique is often regarded as the opening salvo of second wave feminism in the United States, later said that reading The Second Sex in the early 1950s \"led me to whatever original analysis of women's existence I have been able to contribute to the Women's movement and to its unique politics.

Throughout this time period, the role of the housewife was not only accepted in society, but a sought-after desire. Eventually, women, due to the difficulty and consuming nature of these tasks, began to focus solely on one profession.

Some feminist researchers are influenced by the works of writer and researcher, Ann Oakley, who pioneered an interview methodology based on an anti-oppression framework. Oakley argues that the form of structured interviews positions the interviewee as a subordinate, which supports the masculine \"paradigm of inquiry\" and produces a \"perfect interview\" that is \"morally indefensible\". As an alternative, Oakley writes that \"the best way to find out about someone else's lives is through non-hierarchical relationships where the interviewer is prepared to invest their own personal identity in the research relationship, answering questions and sharing knowledge\". Oakley argues that interviews need to be conducted as equal relationships so that the research can lead to a retrieval of more fruitful and significant data. Together, Howard Becker and Oakley have argued that interviews should be more natural and more like an everyday conversation. Oakley argues that traditional guidelines contradict the aims of feminist research and that for a feminist interviewing women, the \"use of prescribed interviewing practice is morally indefensible [and] general and irreconcilable contradictions at the heart of the textbook are exposed\". This approach is viewed by many contemporary researchers as ethically responsible and it is very relevant in terms of developing research approaches that are grounded by the experience of in minorities. \"Feminists have argued that the production of atomistic 'facts' and figures fracture people's lives\" and letting others speak for themselves allows work to be produced which challenges stereotypes, oppression, and exploitation. Only one small part of experience is abstracted typically from structured interviews and questionnaires as the focus for attention as it is only \"a simple matrix of standardized variables which is unable to convey an in-depth understanding of, feeling of, the people under the study\". To break down imbalances of power within the relationships of the interviewer and the interviewee, the unstructured interview approach to research maximizes the ability to explore a full account of life experience. It can be seen that the principle belief of feminist research \"must begin with an open-ended exploration of women's experiences, since only from that vantage point is it possible to see how their world is organized and the extent to which it differs from that of men\". It is also important to note that this approach to research is used to explore life experience from those belonging to all other minority groups.", "===Ann Oakley===", "Distinguished British sociologist, feminist, and writer, Ann Oakley has written numerous academic works focusing on the lives and roles of women in society. Oakley is a well-known pioneer in the unstructured interview research approach directed towards qualitative research that challenges existing power imbalances within the relationships of the interviewer and the interviewee. Oakley sees both issues as interlinked or, as she puts it \"no intimacy without reciprocity\". In 1974, Oakley interviewed women twice before the birth of their children and then twice afterwards. Each woman was interviewed for around nine hours on average. The women also asked her questions during the interviews and Oakley responded as openly and honestly as she wished for them to respond. Oakley wanted the respondents to be collaborators in her research rather than just interviewees causing the women to become increasingly interested in the research and contacting her with any information they thought important after the interviews. Oakley as well used the unstructured interview approach to study women's experiences of both house work and maternity care. Oakley interviewed 40 women about how much housework they did and how they and their partners organised domestic work. Both unstructured interview studies \"were aimed at raising awareness of women's experiences and of promoting policy changes - for example, Oakley called for domestic work to be recognized as 'work' and to be given an appropriate status in relation to paid employment\". These are prime examples of the advantages of rapport and the depth of information even beyond the interview using the unstructured interview research approach."]}, {"page": "Oakley (surname)", "response": ["*Ann Oakley (born 1944), British sociologist, feminist, and writer"]}, {"page": "Annie Oakley (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Ann Oakley (born 1944), British sociologist, feminist, and writer"]}, {"page": "Laura Lamson", "response": ["She and King divorced in 1986 and she brought up their two young sons, Matthew and Jamie, as a single parent.
