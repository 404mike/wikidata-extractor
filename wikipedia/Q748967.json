The value of forests was realised very early and forest management was introduced early on the sub-continent. The links between water, climate and forest cover were noted particularly early and warnings on deforestation were sounded as early as 1840 by surgeons in the East India Company like Edward Balfour.Grove, Richard. 1995 Green Imperialism: Colonial Expansion, Tropical Island Edens and the Origins of Environmentalism, 1600\u20131860. Cambridge University Press.  This was to lead to forest conservation measures although the later policies of forest management were aimed at the production of commercial products such as teak timber. The post of a conservationist was created and this term was related to the patches of forests that they managed, called conservancies, and was not related to biodiversity conservation. Even today, vast tracts of Indian forests are covered with teak plantations, low in biodiversity and seasonally ravaged by forest fires. The first foresters in India were highly influenced by forest management in Germany and many forest officers in India were trained in the German school of thought brought into India by Dietrich Brandis (1824\u20131907)-the father of tropical forestry.Barton, Gregory Allen (2002) Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism. Cambridge University Press  Numerous officers including James Sykes Gamble (1847\u20131925), Alexander Gibson and Hugh Francis Cleghorn in the Indian Forest service added information on the flora of India. Several amateurs also worked alongside from other civil services and they were assisted by professional botanists such as Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817\u20131911), John Gerard Koenig (1728\u20131785), Robert Wight (1796\u20131872), Nathaniel Wallich (1786\u20131854) and William Roxburgh (1751\u20131815), the Father of Indian Botany.Bole, P.
