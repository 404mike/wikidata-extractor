Her mother's name is not recorded. She had at least one brother and at least one sister, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d (died c.\u20091002). \u00c6lffl\u00e6d was married to Byrhtnoth, who probably succeeded her father as ealdorman of Essex. Byrhtnoth was killed at the Battle of Maldon in 991. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d and \u00c6lffl\u00e6d were \u00c6lfgar's heirs at his death, some time between 946 and 951 based on the dating of his will, S1483.\n\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d married Edmund following the death in 944 of his first wife \u00c6lfgifu, mother of the future kings Eadwig and Edgar. She and Edmund are not known to have had any children, and Edmund was killed in 946, leaving \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as a wealthy widow. Records of Ely Cathedral, to which she, her sister, and her brother-in-law, were generous benefactors, say that she then married ealdorman  \u00c6thelstan, probably \u00c6thelstan Rota.\nHowever, the suggestion that she remarried has been disputed.\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's will survives, S1494, and her will, and thus her death, is dated to between 962, and more probably 975, and 991.
