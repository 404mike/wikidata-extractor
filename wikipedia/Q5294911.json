When Paul Munden returned to the Leicestershire first team later in the season it was as a direct replacement for Vic, who had played in the previous match and who did not play any further first-team cricket thereafter. Paul Munden's first-class cricket overlapped with the shorter first-class career of his other brother, Donald Munden, and they played alongside each other as middle order batsmen in two matches in the 1961 season."]}]}}
