Others are less convinced. Suhayl Saadi (a writer of Pakistani descent), for instance, praises \"the powerful, sometimes homoerotic, depiction of violence and sexual frustration\" but notes that the \"good\" people in the novel all tend to speak in Received Pronunciation accents (\"Empathy is created for South Asians only if they speak with a British accent\") and this linguistic stereotyping leads Saadi to conclude that Londonstani \"is a shabby, 21st-century, Orientalism and is not dissimilar from the mentality via which the Middle East is being re-colonised.\"", "The plot, and especially the ending, was praised by some and severely criticized by others. Tim Martin praised the \"shattering twist that maintains total narrative cogency while turning the entire book upside down,\" but Suhayl Saadi calls it \"contrived and unconvincing\" and complains of a \"clunky\" plot. James Bridle, on ReadySteadyBook, agrees, in an otherwise positive review: \"The less said about the final twist, which smacks of rushed, massive-advance-mediated desperation, the better.\" Mandy Sayer, writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, praises the novel for exuding a \"charming, original energy\" but criticizes \"the surprise ending and resolution [which] is disappointing, clich\u00e9d and trite.\" Her overall conclusion: \"As a contemporary cultural artefact, Londonstani is second to none. As a novel, it is overwritten and undercrafted. I have no doubt it will do very well.\""]}, {"page": "Roman Turovsky-Savchuk", "response": ["Roman Turovsky-Savchuk (Ukrainian: \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0422\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439-\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0443\u043a) is an American artist-painter, photographer and videoinstallation artist,http://culturecatch.com/art/head-show as well as a lutenist-composer,Suhayl Saadi Uncensored \u00ab Kitaab.
