George was the younger brother of James Burns (1789-1871), with whom he formed a partnership, J. & G. Burns. Together, they started sailing ships between Glasgow and Liverpool, as well as across the Atlantic to Canada and the United States. J. & G. Burns set up the regular steamer service to the Inner and Outer Hebrides. This was sold to David Hutcheson & Co in 1851, and by the mid-1870s, it formed the basis of David MacBrayne Ltd, which today operates as Caledonian MacBrayne across the west coast of Scotland.\nBurns was party to the consolidation of a number of companies, including the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, into the Cunard Line, which had been begun by Sir Samuel Cunard. The Cunard Line merged with the White Star Line in 1936, and was to launch liners such as the RMS Queen Mary (1936). Today it is a US-owned cruise company, which operated the famous RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2).\nIn addition to his shipping interests, Burns was also one of the largest shareholders in The Glasgow and South-Western Railway\nBurns retired to Wemyss Bay in Renfrewshire (Inverclyde). He was made a baronet at age 94 in 1889, the oldest ever recipient of the award. A devout Episcopalian, Edwin Hodder wrote a hagiography of Burns, and J.J. Burnet's Inverclyde Church was instituted in the memory of Burns and his wife. John Burns (1829\u20131901), his eldest son, succeeded him in the baronetcy, became head of the Cunard Company and was created a peer, under the title of Baron Inverclyde, in 1897.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet (1795\u20131890), shipping magnate"]}, {"page": "George Burns (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet (1795\u20131890), Scottish shipping magnate"]}, {"page": "Sir George Burns", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Baron Inverclyde", "response": ["*Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet (1795\u20131890)"]}, {"page": "George, Baronet Burns", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "George Burns (shipping magnate)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "1795 in Great Britain", "response": ["* 10 December \u2013 Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet, shipping magnate (died 1890)"]}, {"page": "James Burns (Scottish shipowner)", "response": ["Unlike his older brothers, James Burns turned to commerce, and was joined by his younger brother, Sir George Burns, 1st Baronet (1795\u20131890), in 1818, setting up as J. & G.

After six years, the two brothers moved into shipping, joining with Hugh Mathie of Liverpool to establish a small shipping line of six sailing vessels plying between the two ports. The Clyde was then the leading waterway for steam navigation; within a year James and George Burns had ordered their first steamer, and they quickly replaced all their sail ships by steamboats. While George was mainly interested in the technical aspects of the ships, it was James who was the chief commercial influence in the business, supervising the day-to-day transactions, the negotiation of cargoes and contracts."]}, {"page": "John Burns, 1st Baron Inverclyde", "response": ["John Burns, 1st Baron Inverclyde,  (24 June 1829 \u2013 12 February 1901) was a ship owner.
