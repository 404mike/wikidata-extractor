In his BBC years he introduced works by foreign composers, including Bart\u00f3k, Berg, Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Webern.  A modest man who disliked the limelight, Boult felt as comfortable in the recording studio as on the concert platform, making recordings throughout his career. From the mid-1960s until his retirement after his last sessions in 1978 he recorded extensively for EMI.
