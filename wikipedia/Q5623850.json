The 1991 series featured the saga Where is Don Day? starring Tony Robinson and Michelle Collins, about a bank manager whose dull life is suddenly changed when he accidentally becomes involved in a robbery from his own bank. 1992 saw Dead Ringer starring Tony Slattery; a thriller about a man suffering from amnesia trying to discover who he really is, whilst being hunted down by a hitman named Preston, played by Roger Lloyd-Pack. In 1993, the round featured Roy Barraclough and Annabel Giles in a collection of investigative police stories, with Barraclough playing a retired police detective.

Kathy is horrified when she hears about Ben wanting to donate some of his liver to Phil. She firmly tells him that she will not allow him to do so but Ben insists. Kathy accompanies Ben to his appointment to discuss the transplant. Kathy tries to support him but ends up embarrassing him when she mentions Paul's death and suggests that it is a reason for Ben wanting to donate. An angry Ben later tells Kathy to stay out of his life as she always has done. Kathy joins the Walford Players and clashes with the Christmas show's director, Geraldine Clough (Gwyneth Strong) over her plans initially to run a talent show, then to have a fairy godmother in her version of A Christmas Carol and finally for casting Kathy as a pantomime horse. Kathy's protests lead to Geraldine's resignation and Kathy becoming the director.

Phil gives Ben The Arches and Kathy lets slip to Ben about the value of the car lot land, which Phil hands over to Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick). Kathy insists to Phil that he justifies his reasons to Ben about the car lot land. Kathy returns from holiday and finds out from Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) about the gas explosion that left Jane severely injured and that Steven has died. Ian rejects Kathy's support. Ben tells Kathy that Ian may still have anger towards her for faking her death, despite accepting her. Kathy confides in Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) about her relationship with Ian and Carmel advises her to work at it. Kathy tells Ian and Ben that she feels that she has become irrelevant to them, but is determined to be their mum and apologises for not being there and Ian finally shows his emotions."]}, {"page": "The Jolly Boys' Outing", "response": ["*Gwyneth Strong as Cassandra Trotter"]}, {"page": "Edward the Seventh", "response": ["*Gwyneth Strong as Minny (episodes 4\u20135)"]}, {"page": "Gwyneth", "response": ["*Gwyneth Strong (born 1959), an English actress"]}, {"page": "Yuppy Love", "response": ["| Gwyneth Strong"]}, {"page": "Chain Gang (Only Fools and Horses)", "response": ["| Gwyneth Strong"]}, {"page": "Fatal Extraction", "response": ["| Gwyneth Strong"]}, {"page": "List of Only Fools and Horses characters", "response": ["| Gwyneth Strong", "| Cassandra || Gwyneth Strong|| \"Yuppy Love\""]}, {"page": "Heroes and Villains (Only Fools and Horses)", "response": ["| Gwyneth Strong"]}, {"page": "Modern Men (Only Fools and Horses)", "response": ["| Gwyneth Strong"]}, {"page": "Little Problems", "response": ["| Gwyneth Strong"]}, {"page": "Lorraine Bowen", "response": ["She studied music at the University of Surrey, and then busked around London.
