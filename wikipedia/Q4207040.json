In the Enchanted Forest, Malcolm leaves his son in the care of two spinners, who give Rumplestiltskin a magical bean to create a portal to leave his careless father. Using the magic bean, Malcolm and Rumplestiltskin travel to Neverland, a place which Malcolm envisions in his dreams. He decides to stay in Neverland, abandoning Rumplestilskin. Malcolm transforms into his younger self, adopting the name of Peter Pan. The Shadow informs Pan that his youth is limited, and he will die when the hourglass of Skull Rock is complete. Some time later, Pan visits Hamelin in the Enchanted Forest posing as the Pied Piper to expand what would later become the Lost Boys. He also blackmails John and Michael Darling to help him with his tasks, in exchange for their sister Wendy's life, who had been lured back to Neverland, sending them to the Land Without Magic before the Queen's curse to retrieve a boy soon-to-be-born. After Henry is brought to Neverland, he tricks him by being a fugitive boy. He later reveals to Henry that he has the Heart of the Truest Believer.

After death, Malcolm's Peter Pan form ends up in the Underworld. When the heroes arrive in the Underworld, Pan plans to return to the living by exchanging one of their lives. Mr. Gold later enlists Pan as part of a loophole for a deal with Hades that involves abducting Zelena before the two of them can have dinner together. After the contract for Gold and Belle's baby is ripped up by Hades, Pan and Mr. Gold then plan to use Robin's heart to revive Pan. However, it was a trick by Mr. Gold as the heart he has put into Pan's body is actually a wineskin he had filled with water from the River of Lost Souls and glamoured as a heart sending him into the River of Lost Souls."]}]}}
