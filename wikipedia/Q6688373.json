He appeared once for Oxford University in 1920, and then 11 times for Somerset in 1921 and 1922.\nEducated at Douai School, Wharton was a right-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional bowler, though his bowling style is not known. He was at Oxford University as a \"senior\" in 1920 and played in two of three trial matches at the start of the season. He figured in only one first-class match for the university, however, in what Wisden described as \"a very weak side\" against The Army. Despite scoring 47 of a total of 95 in the second Oxford innings, and taking two of the three wickets he managed in his career during this match, he was not picked again.In 1921, Wharton appeared spasmodically across the season for Somerset, batting with some success in several matches. His most successful period came towards the end of June. Against Derbyshire at Derby, he made 60 in Somerset's first innings, his first score of more than 50. Then in the following game, against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, he top-scored in both Somerset innings, making 86 in the first and an unbeaten 55 to win the match in the second. The 86 was his highest first-class score.\nWharton reappeared for Somerset in two matches in 1922 but was not successful and did not play first-class cricket again after this.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Louis Wharton (1921\u20131922) 11 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Douai School", "response": ["*Louis Wharton (1896\u20131957), cricketer", "External fixtures, which were unknown at old Douai, were soon organized after the move to England. Cricket and hockey were played at the new school from 1905, and from 1918 to 1919 rugby union replaced soccer as the main winter sport (soccer returned as a minor sport in 1962). In 1920, the Trinidadian Louis Wharton became Douai's first Oxford University cricketer, having won a Blue for soccer the previous year. He went on to play cricket for Somerset. After the war the Surrey all-rounder Alan Peach was cricket coach, succeeded by Frank Shipston of Nottinghamshire. An indoor swimming pool was built in 1937."]}, {"page": "Cuthbert Fairbanks-Smith", "response": ["Fairbanks-Smith's cricket career was brief and undistinguished. Somerset played the two university sides, first Oxford and then Cambridge in consecutive matches in a single week in mid-May. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Somerset started the week at Oxford in some disarray: \"Somerset were in such a plight that they had to complete their side by including four Oxford men,\" it said. Three of the four were certainly Kenneth Blaikie, Louis Wharton and John Frazer \u2013 the first two went on to play other matches for Somerset, but Frazer's county cricket was otherwise for Sussex. It is not clear who the fourth was, but as all the other players in the Oxford match had played before for Somerset, Wisden could have meant Fairbanks-Smith. Either way, he batted at No 10, made 0 and 6, took one catch and did not bowl. Alone of the four Oxford conscripts, Fairbanks-Smith accompanied the Somerset side on to Cambridge, where he was 0 not out at the end of the Somerset first innings and then \"absent\" in the second innings.Cricket Archive has Fairbanks-Smith as \"absent hurt\" in the second innings, but there is no record of any injury and given Somerset's difficulty in raising a side that week he may simply have had to leave before the end of the match.  He did not appear in first-class cricket afterwards."]}, {"page": "Wharton (name)", "response": ["* Louis Wharton (1896\u20131957), West Indian-born English cricketer"]}]}}
