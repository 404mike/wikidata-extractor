He appeared once for Oxford University in 1920, and then 11 times for Somerset in 1921 and 1922.\nEducated at Douai School, Wharton was a right-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional bowler, though his bowling style is not known. He was at Oxford University as a \"senior\" in 1920 and played in two of three trial matches at the start of the season. He figured in only one first-class match for the university, however, in what Wisden described as \"a very weak side\" against The Army. Despite scoring 47 of a total of 95 in the second Oxford innings, and taking two of the three wickets he managed in his career during this match, he was not picked again.In 1921, Wharton appeared spasmodically across the season for Somerset, batting with some success in several matches. His most successful period came towards the end of June. Against Derbyshire at Derby, he made 60 in Somerset's first innings, his first score of more than 50. Then in the following game, against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, he top-scored in both Somerset innings, making 86 in the first and an unbeaten 55 to win the match in the second. The 86 was his highest first-class score.\nWharton reappeared for Somerset in two matches in 1922 but was not successful and did not play first-class cricket again after this.", "link_mentions": {}}}
