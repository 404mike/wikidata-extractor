Despite waking up the morning of the competition with severe abdominal pain and being told by doctors to withdraw, Iordache competed in the qualification round. In the qualification round, she placed fourth in the all-around with a score of 54.698 behind Russians Angelina Melnikova, Viktoria Listunova, and Vladislava Urazova. Because Russia could only earn one Olympic spot at the European Championships, Iordache successfully qualified a nominative spot for the Olympics.  She also qualified in first place to the balance beam final, despite a fall, and sixth place in the floor exercise final. She later withdrew from the all-around and event finals due to a kidney infection that required hospitalization. She had to take two weeks off of training once she was released from the hospital. At the end of the European Championships, Iordache was presented with the Shooting Star award from the event's sponsor, SmartScoring, alongside Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan. The award is given to a female and a male gymnast who have an exceptional story and are inspirations for future gymnasts."]}, {"page": "McClenaghan", "response": ["*Rhys McClenaghan (born 1999), Irish artistic gymnast"]}, {"page": "2015 Northern European Gymnastics Championships", "response": ["||   Kieran Behan  Jack Neill  Rhys McClenaghan  Andrew Smith  Rohan Sebastian "]}, {"page": "2017 in gymnastics", "response": ["** Men's pommel horse winner: Rhys McClenaghan"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland at the 2018 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|align=left|Rhys McClenaghan", "|align=left rowspan=2|Rhys McClenaghan"]}, {"page": "2018 in artistic gymnastics", "response": ["|TF:  EnglandAA:  Nile WilsonFX:  Marios GeorgiouPH:  Rhys McClenaghanSR:  Courtney TullochVT:  Christopher RemkesPB:  Marios GeorgiouHB:  Nile Wilson", "|TF:   Russia FX: Dominick Cunningham PH: Rhys McClenaghan SR: Eleftherios Petrounias VT: Artur Dalaloyan PB: Artur Dalaloyan HB: Oliver Hegi", "|FX:  Ahmet OnderManrique LarduetPH:  Rhys McClenaghanSR:  Ibrahim ColakVT:  Ren\u00e9 CournoyerPB:  Andrei MunteanHB:  Umit Samiloglu", "|  Rhys McClenaghan", "| Rhys McClenaghan", "| Rhys McClenaghan", "|Rhys McClenaghan"]}, {"page": "2018 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series", "response": ["|  Rhys McClenaghan"]}]}}
