He returned to Scotland in the late 18th century, where his major work was the development of cotton mills and a town next to Carlingwark Loch. This was a planned town set around a grid plan system of streets, similar to that of Edinburgh's New Town, planned at around the same time. This town was named Castle Douglas in 1792, having previously been known as \"Carlingwark\". Sir William also established cotton mills in Newton Stewart, which was temporarily renamed \"Newton Douglas\" in his honour,  and a range of industries in Castle Douglas including a brewery, woollen mill, soap works and tannery.\nDouglas was granted a baronetcy in 1801. In 1805 he built himself a mansion at Gelston Castle, which has been attributed to architect Robert Crichton. The castellated mansion is currently a vacant shell.An obelisk was erected in the village of Gelston in his memory.  He died unmarried, in 1809, and his lands were divided amongst his nieces and nephews, whilst his baronetcy became extinct.\nHis body was buried in a mausoleum which has been attributed to architect Walter Newall, named The Douglas Mausoleum, and this was added upon with at least 20 more members of family over the years. The site on Kelton Hill overlooks Carlingwark towards Castle Douglas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Castle Douglas", "response": ["* Sir William Douglas, 1st Baronet 1801, (1745-1809), Founder of the burgh of Castle Douglas.
