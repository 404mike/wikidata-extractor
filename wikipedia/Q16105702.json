His best season as a wicketkeeper was 1961, when he received his county cap and took 72 catches with 7 stumpings. As a batsman, he scored 561 runs in 1960 with an average of 12.46 and a highest score of just 44: the high aggregate reflects the fact that he went in at No 8 because in Terry Spencer, John Savage and Brian Boshier or Peter Broughton, there were usually three even worse batsmen than he was, and Leicestershire usually batted twice in each match. His highest score, one of only two innings over 50, was 51, made against Worcestershire in 1962 as a high-scoring match petered out to a draw."]}, {"page": "1957\u201358 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| John Mitten"]}, {"page": "Mitten, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Mitten"]}]}}
