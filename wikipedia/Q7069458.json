In 1981, he joined ITV Sport's horse racing coverage which moved, during 1984 and 1985, to Channel 4 as Channel 4 Racing. In October 2012, the channel announced that he would be dropped from its team, which McCririck blamed on ageism and took the matter to an employment tribunal, but lost the case.\nFrom the 1980s, McCririck appeared as a contestant on numerous television shows, including Bullseye,  You Bet!, Celebrity Big Brother, Weakest Link, Wife Swap and Celebrity Poker Club.
