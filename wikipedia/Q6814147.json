At the Royal College, he was told by the then director Sir David Willcocks that he would have to study a second instrument; so he chose the harpsichord, which began his interest in early keyboards.Upon returning to Singapore in 2005, he was fined for not having done National Service in Singapore, although he was studying in London during the time he was required to serve, he had already started a busy concert career, and he had already acquired British citizenship.During his development as a pianist, Tan developed a passion for the fortepiano, which he has promoted throughout his career, and thereby changed other musicians' perceptions of this instrument. He has now returned mainly to the pianoforte and performs a wide-ranging repertoire from Bach to Messiaen. Of Messiaen, Tan has announced that mastering the composer's Vingt regards sur l'enfant-J\u00e9sus has been his proudest accomplishment: \"It took me nearly two years to learn it, but it was the most life-enriching, the most life-changing experience because it was so spiritual and it changed the way I performed.\"He has lived in London since 1978, and continues to give concerts worldwide. In 2007, he performed at the Royal Academy of Arts for Jasper Conran's London Fashion Week collection.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yehudi Menuhin School", "response": ["*Melvyn Tan, pianist"]}, {"page": "Anglo-Chinese School", "response": ["** Melvyn Tan, international pianist"]}, {"page": "Fortepiano", "response": ["A number of modern harpsichordists and pianists have achieved distinction in fortepiano performance, including Susan Alexander-Max, Paul Badura-Skoda, Malcolm Bilson, Hendrik Bouman, Ronald Brautigam, Wolfgang Brunner, Gary Cooper, J\u00f6rg Demus, Ursula D\u00fctschler.

Clarity over how judges would sentence a defaulter was clearer in successive landmark cases. In 2010, Seow Wei Sin was initially given an 18-month sentence, which was lowered to S$5,000 on appeal after the courts had determined that Seow had little substantial connection to Singapore except being born here, and thus had a low culpability for committing the default. In 2016, Brian Joseph Chow was initially handed a S$4,500 fine, which was set aside for one-and-a-half month jail time upon appeal.
