Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy from a poor working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair\u2014adopting the Latin motto per aspera ad astra (through hardship to the stars)\u2014began engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, as well as the Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as aluminium foil to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons's mother sent him away to study at the Brown Military Academy for Boys, a private boarding school in San Diego, but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.", "In 2005 Weidenfeld & Nicolson published Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons by George Pendle, who described Parsons as \"the Che Guevara of occultism\". Pendle said that although Parsons \"would not live to see his dream of space travel come true, he was essential to making it a reality.\" Pendle considered that the cultural stigma attached to Parsons' occultism was the primary cause of his low public profile, noting that \"Like many scientific mavericks, Parsons was eventually discarded by the establishment once he had served his purpose.\" It was this unorthodox mindset, \u200acreatively facilitated by his science fiction fandom and \"willingness to believe in magic's efficacy\", \u200aPendle argued, \"that allowed him to break scientific barriers previously thought to be indestructible\"\u2014commenting that Parsons \"saw both space and magic as ways of exploring these new frontiers\u2014one breaking free from Earth literally and metaphysically.\""]}, {"page": "Qian Xuesen", "response": ["While at Caltech, Tsien had secretly attended meetings with J.
