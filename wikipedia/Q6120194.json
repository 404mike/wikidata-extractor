In 2009, Doctor Who Magazine readers voted it in eighth place. In a more recent 2014 poll, the magazine's readers voted it fifth best Doctor Who story of all time. A 2008 article in The Daily Telegraph named City of Death one of the ten greatest episodes of Doctor Who. John Condor, writing in the fanzine DWB in 1991, hailed the story as \"the best blend of kitsch, surrealism, fantasy and comedy-drama seen in our favourite Time Lord's annals\".Howe & Walker, The Television Companion, p, 478. Vanessa Bishop, reviewing the serial's DVD release, described it as \"imaginatively written, well-performed and beautifully made, City of Death is a story where pretty much everything works\". Reacting to the serial, as part of Doctor Who Magazines ongoing \"Time Team\" feature, Jacqueline Rayner said \"you're suddenly, almost violently, made aware this is happening in our world... with people just getting on with their business and two Time Lords walking through it. I don't think I've ever experienced that with Doctor Who up till now... it's the tiny touches of mundanity amid the fantastical that lift the story even higher\". Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it on their list of \"10 TV Episodes that Changed Television\", citing \"the sharp dialogue and clever use of time travel [that] prefigure everything Steven Moffat has done with the series in recent years.\" The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn described City of Death as the \"gem\" of the seventeenth season, finding Adams' subtle comedy script \"easily the funniest and most quotable the series ever achieved\".

According to DWM editor Tom Spilsbury, it hadn't occurred to him before that he was anything other than being alive, and that \"it might come down to semantics over what being alive means\". Doctor Who scriptwriter Gareth Roberts believed that Rassilon is dead and the face that appears is \"a clever AI\". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies believed that Rassilon is \"clearly alive\", with his big face in the story being \"A projection from the Matrix. A mental life extending beyond the body's death.\" Spin-off writer George Mann believed that Rassilon was dead, but the Time Lords had figured out a way of \"resurrecting dead people in extreme circumstances\", doing \"something horrible and timey wimey\". Spin-off writer and DWM columnist Jacqueline Rayner described his condition as \"a permanent sleep which is pretty much indistinguishable from death\", and that \"He's immortal, but he has no awareness,\" and when the trap inside the Tomb of Rassilon is triggered, \"he becomes semi-aware so he can oversee or judge what's going on, before going back into his eternal sleep again\". DWM deputy editor Peter Ware believed that Rassilon is dead by the time of The Five Doctors, and his dead mind is speaking from the Matrix to the Doctors and Borusa. He mentions the line from the episode \"Hell Bent\" (2015)\u2014\"Rassilon the resurrected\", as further proof that he had died. Doctor Who scriptwriter Mark Gatiss quipped that Rassilon is \"biding his time until he regenerates into [actor] Daniel Craig\". Head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat, who also wrote \"Hell Bent\", understood that Rassilon was \"alive, but in 'eternal sleep'\", having got up from his eternal sleep to participate in the Time War, \"And got killed. And resurrected. Because that happened a lot in the Time War.\" According to scriptwriter Terrance Dicks, who wrote The Five Doctors, Rassilon has \"gone to a higher plane where he's a benevolent being who can, if he feels it's a big enough crisis, intervene\"."]}, {"page": "Harry Sullivan (Doctor Who)", "response": ["In David A.

In \"New Earth\" (2006), Rose's body is temporarily inhabited by Cassandra, who kisses the Doctor romantically. This is one of the few scenes in the entire programme where the Doctor is kissed romantically by his companion. In \"School Reunion\" (2006), the arrival of the Doctor's previous companion Sarah Jane Smith and his reaction to seeing her again prompts jealousy and worry from Rose, and Sarah all but admits that she has long been in love with the Doctor. The Doctor also expresses dismay at having his companions age while he regenerates. In the episode, \"The Girl in the Fireplace\" (2006) (written by Steven Moffat), the Doctor develops a romantic relationship with Madame de Pompadour, with whom he shares a passionate kiss. She even takes him away to \"dance\", but how far the metaphor (coined in the episode \"The Doctor Dances\") is taken is not seen on screen. Rose does not openly exhibit jealousy towards Madame de Pompadour. In the novel The Stone Rose, by Jacqueline Rayner, the Doctor kisses Rose after she saves him from being petrified, with it being described as \"a kiss of gratitude and joy and unspeakable pleasure at being alive\". In \"The Impossible Planet\" (2006), the Doctor and Rose share an awkward moment when they have to consider settling down in one time period and Rose suggests they do so together. She later plants a kiss for good luck on the Doctor's spacesuit prior to his descent into the pit. In \"The Satan Pit\" the Doctor, fearing for his life, tells someone \"If you see Rose, tell her... tell her... oh, she knows.\" In \"Doomsday\", when the Doctor says his goodbye to Rose, she finally tells him that she loves him.

Not originally cast in the production, Tennant was recording a radio play in a neighbouring studio, and when he discovered what was being recorded next door convinced the director to give him a small role. This personal enthusiasm for the series had also been expressed by his participation in several audio plays based on the Doctor Who television series which had been produced by Big Finish Productions, although he did not play the Doctor in any of these productions. His first such role was in the Seventh Doctor audio Colditz, where he played a Nazi lieutenant guard at Colditz Castle. In 2004 Tennant played a lead role in the Big Finish audio play series Dalek Empire III as Galanar, a young man who is given an assignment to discover the secrets of the Daleks. In 2005, he starred in UNIT: The Wasting for Big Finish, recreating his role of Brimmicombe-Wood from a Doctor Who Unbound play, Sympathy for the Devil. In both audio productions, he worked alongside Nicholas Courtney, who reprised the character of Sir Alastair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. He also played an unnamed Time Lord in another Doctor Who Unbound play Exile. UNIT: The Wasting, was recorded between Tennant getting the role of the Doctor and it being announced. He played the title role in Big Finish's adaptation of Bryan Talbot's The Adventures of Luther Arkwright (2005). In 2006, he recorded abridged audio books of The Stone Rose by Jacqueline Rayner, The Feast of the Drowned by Stephen Cole and The Resurrection Casket by Justin Richards, for BBC Worldwide."]}]}}
