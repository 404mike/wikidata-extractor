Razer skilfully avoided the axe and lowered its arm into Terrorhurtz's polycarbonate armour panels. Terrorhurtz lined up for another strike, but Razer slid its wedge under Terrorhurtz's chassis, burying its arm in its opponent, carried Terrorhurtz to the pit release button, and dropped it into the pit. Only Tornado stood between Razer and a successful title defence. However, after having suffered two sound defeats by Razer, the developers of Tornado had added a metal frame with a large horizontal rotating blade. Having declared the modification to the judges prior to the competition, it controversially qualified as an \"interchangeable weapon\", and the added advantage of this setup was that the size of the framework needed to support the large spinning blade prevented Razer's claw from reaching Tornado's chassis. Team Razer responded by attaching a metal lifting hook to the front of their robot's crushing arm just moments before the fight. Although the team knew this additional weapon would still not allow them to pierce Tornado's main body, they hoped that it could lift it into the air by the framework. In the battle, Tornado's superior pushing power was used to great effect early on, as it slammed Razer into the arena wall and the house robots, but it suffered severe damage to its external frame in the process, resulting in the rotating blade severing its own drive belt. Despite suffering a few dents from its encounter with the arena walls and one huge blow from Shunt's axe, Razer turned the tables in the fight's last moments. Razer lifted Tornado up using its new hook and carried it over to the pit, but the size of the additional framework prevented Tornado from falling in, the first example of what commentator Jonathan Pearce called an 'anti-pit device' or 'APD'. The fight was stopped about 15 seconds later, but the Razer team argued that Tornado was suspended above the pit and therefore immobilised. After a 45-minute discussion, during which the judges inspected each of the robots for damage and took the final stages of the fight into account, the judges narrowly and controversially ruled in favour of Tornado becoming the new UK champion.", "The European Championship was Razer's next\u2014and final\u2014televised tournament, for which it qualified as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser to set up a semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries once again attached the anti-crusher frame that had proven so effective in their previous meeting in the series six grand final, but the Razer team had clearly prepared for this, and installed a revised, stronger version of the lifting hook. Although Tornado was the early aggressor, Razer's new hook proved far more effective, hoisting Tornado into the air and dragged it towards the pit. However, once again, the size of Tornado's framework made it virtually impossible for Razer to drop it in. Indeed, commentator Jonathan Pearce wondered aloud during live commentary whether the judges, following the conclusion of the fight, would take a look at Torando's external 'rigging' for future iterations of Robot Wars and discuss whether it should be allowed. With Razer unable to drop Tornado in the pit, time expired and the result went to a judges' decision, who awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight throughout. However, in a split decision, the Razer team decided this was an unfair ruling, given that the judges had not realised that the strain of lifting Tornado in the second half of the battle had caused Razer's drive motors to burn out, technically rendering it immobile for more than 30 seconds. They therefore graciously conceded the match to  Tornado, who went on to beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title."]}, {"page": "The Game (audio drama)", "response": ["*Garny Diblick \u2014 Jonathan Pearce"]}, {"page": "Steve Wilson (football commentator)", "response": ["After several years working for Capital Gold supporting Jonathan Pearce, Wilson moved to BBC Radio Five Live in the summer of 1998.
