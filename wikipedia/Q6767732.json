Borland again struggled to break into the first team and played only once more for Scunthorpe before being released at the end of the season. A career in non-league football followed; he signed for Accrington Stanley ahead of the 1997\u201398 season and spent 18 months with the club before being released after the arrival of new manager Wayne Harrison in January 1999. After spending several months without a club, Borland joined North West Counties League side Rossendale United along with fellow former Accrington players Glenn Little and Paul Daughtry. Borland was a regular starter for Rossendale during his first year at the club, but then suffered a back injury which limited his appearances and eventually forced him to announce his retirement from football in November 2001."]}, {"page": "2012 UEFA European Under-17 Championship", "response": ["* Mark Gavin"]}, {"page": "1986 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["| || ||Mark Gavin"]}, {"page": "Gavin, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Gavin"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Mark Gavin"]}]}}
