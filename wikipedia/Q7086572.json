She was recruited as an MI5 infiltration agent by Maxwell Knight of B5(b) Section in 1931. Under the instructions of Knight, Gray moved to London and became a member of the Friends of the Soviet Union in 1932. Knight's reasoning behind Gray's becoming a member of a pro-Soviet organisation but not actually offering to spy on Britain for the Soviet Union, was that the most successful counterespionage agents were those who were approached by the enemy organisation.\nThis plan met with success in 1934. Then, after a period of working for the Anti-War Movement, she was approached by Harry Pollitt and asked to undertake a 'special mission', on behalf of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Having accepted the request, Gray was sent to Paris on June 6, 1934; she was to rendezvous with Percy Glading, an officer of League Against Anti-Imperialism and a founding member of the CPGB.Following the meeting, Gray was instructed by Glading to go to India to deliver money and messages to insurgent elements. However, the cover story provided to Gray by the CPGB was so flimsy for a woman travelling alone during the monsoon season to India that she would easily rouse the suspicion of the authorities. Knight's B5(b) section, therefore, stepped in to concoct a plausible cover story to enable her to continue to gain evidence of CPGB espionage.On her return from India, Gray worked as Pollitt's personal secretary until she dropped all work with the communists in 1935 because of the strain of maintaining a double life.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Pollitt", "response": ["In Operation MASK (1934\u20131937), Olga Gray, an MI5 agent, infiltrated the party, and was for a time Pollitt's personal secretary and clandestine radio operator.  This allowed John Tiltman and his colleagues to crack the code and decrypt, for a few years, messages between Moscow and some of its foreign parties, such as the CPGB.  They revealed the Comintern's close supervision of the Communist Party and Pollitt, as well as the substantial financial support CPGB received from Moscow. Among other things, Pollitt was instructed to refute news leaks about a Stalinist purge.  Some messages were addressed to code names, while others were signed by Pollitt himself. In his transmissions to Moscow, Pollitt regularly pleaded for more funding from the Soviet Union. One 1936 coded instruction advised Pollitt to publicise the plight of Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, a German Communist leader who had been arrested by the Nazis and who later died at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Pollitt replied that he was \"having difficulties\" getting British statesmen to make public declarations supporting Th\u00e4lmann but that they promised they would speak privately with German officials in London. In one of the more amusing dispatches, Pollitt (1936) informed his Soviet contact about a recent visit to France to make campaign appearances for candidates from the French Communist Party. \"At great inconvenience went to Paris to speak in the election campaign\". Pollitt went on to complain that he was \"kept sitting two days and comrades refused to allow me to speak. Such treatment as I received in Paris is a scandal.\""]}, {"page": "Olga Grey", "response": ["Olga Grey (born Anushka Zacsek or Anna Zacsek, November 10, 1896 \u2013 April 25, 1973Social Security Death Index, listed as Anna Zacsek Accessed April 25, 2009) was an American silent film actress, sometimes billed with the alternate spelling of her last name, Olga Gray."]}, {"page": "Maxwell Knight", "response": ["During his career with MI5, Knight found that there was \"a very long standing and ill-founded prejudice against the employment of women as agents\", a position with which he did not agree. Indeed, many of his best agents were women.

The documents had been stolen from Woolwich Arsenal."]}, {"page": "Percy Glading", "response": ["Around 1934, Soviet Intelligence recruited Glading as a spy. Although he no longer worked at the Arsenal, he had maintained contact with men of similar sympathies who still did so. The Arsenal was of interest to the Soviets, who knew that Britain was on the verge of creating the biggest naval gun yet. Glading had set up a safe house in Holland Park, West London, where he photographed various sensitive plans and blueprints. Unbeknown to him, the secret service had infiltrated the CPGB in 1931, with an agent known later as \"Miss X\"\u2014Olga Gray. Glading trusted her and involved her in his espionage activities and lodged her in the Holland Park safe house.", "A 2017 biography of Olga Gray's handler, Maxwell Knight, described Glading as having \"thick lips\" and \"lank hair\". He \"wore large round glasses that made him look like an overgrown schoolboy\" but was \"quick-witted and likeable\".", "Glading's original purpose in India, on behalf of the CPGB, was seeking to forge links with Roy as well as to study Indian working conditions specifically and more generally to promote the Communist Party.  Nigel West says Glading was unimpressed by the efforts of the Indian Communist Party to organise the workers. Indian Political Intelligence noted that Glading had particularly focussed his attention on \"shipyards, munitions works, dockyards and arsenals where strike committees or 'Red Cells' existed\". Rajani Palme Dutt, in Glading's 1970 obituary, reported that Glading was eventually \"deported under the authority of the Viceroy\". Covert journeys to India such as these were common for the CPGB during this period. Pollitt was to persuade Olga Gray to make such a trip in 1934 to transfer funds from Glading to the Indian communist movement. She left England on 11 June 1934 and met Glading in Paris to receive the money and instructions. On her return, Glading obtained work for Gray as Pollitt's secretary.", "Historian Richard Davenport-Hines says there was \"nothing stealthy about his allegiance\" to his chosen causes. In 1930 he became a full-time paid officer for the League Against Imperialism (LAI), where he first encountered Olga Gray, who joined the LAI in 1932. In June 1931, Glading was suspected of personally receiving the CPGB's intelligence reports from its various espionage groups and being the individual responsible for sending them to the USSR. Some of Glading's pro-Soviet activities were undertaken with his wife, who shared his political outlook. She too, for example, had links with the Kirchenstein circle. Another of Glading's associates was Jessie Ayriss, who was married to George Hardy, a fellow member of the Communist Party; Ayriss herself was employed as a typist at the Soviet embassy from 1937 to 1944. Espionage expert Nigel West has suggested she may have acted as a courier for Glading.", "In January 1937, after Maly's recall, Glading was summoned to meet Maly's successor as controller of the Royal Arsenal ring. This was Mikhail Borovoy, a member of the OGPU's Technical Section, who was travelling with his wife under false Canadian passports (as Willy and Mary Brandes) and had arrived in London in October 1936. They lived in Forset Court off the Edgware Road. With Maly the Soviets' resident spy, the Brandes' were to act independently of the rezidentura and deal specifically with the Soviets' special assets: the Cambridge (and, to a lesser extent, Oxford) spy ring. To Glading they went under the names \"Mr and Mrs Stevens\", but they only stayed in London a few weeks before making their way to Paris. In that time, Glading met them at Forset Court. This in itself was a \"highly unusual step\" according to William Duff but essential in assessing the material Glading expected to collect and the resources he needed to do so. They also met Glading's agent within Royal Arsenal, George Whomack, and photographed some secret documents in the Holland Road safe house. Glading and the Stevens also received blueprints from George Whomack in Hyde Park. Mrs Stevens, who was travelling in the guise of a photographer for a furniture company, assisted with the photography during their stay. It was immediately after Glading met the Brandes that he instructed Olga Gray to find a suitable flat or apartment (for example, he specified that there should be no porter to espy their comrades' comings and goings). Glading's operation at Woolwich consisted of George Whomack smuggling out blueprints at the end of a late shift\u2014past military police guards\u2014on the day the document had been released to the arsenal. Around this time Glading told Gray that he was \"doing hardly any work for the party now, it is mostly for other people\".", "The MI5 mole, Olga Gray did not discover his spying for several years. In 1937, she assisted Glading to purchase the ground-floor flat at 82, Holland Road in West London. MI5 likely enabled the sale. The CPGB paid Glading the flat's annual \u00a3100 annual rent (), and he paid Gray the monthly instalments to settle herself. Glading also provided \u00a360 to buy furniture on hire purchase, including a gateleg table for their large-scale photography work. Three sets of keys were cut, of which Glading kept two. During his later prosecution, Gray described some of the activities that went on. The team focussed on photography\u2014which Glading told her was of \"a very secret nature\"\u2014and began extensive testing (on local bus maps) with home-made cameras to make the end product as clear to their Russian recipients as possible. Glading saw Gray as a valuable member of his team: in May 1937, he suggested she give up her job, take a professional photography course, and work for him in the flat full-time. In return, he offered to make up her salary to five pounds a week; Gray accepted, although she was worried that she knew far too little of photography to be of much use; Glading reassured her. He also paid for her to take a holiday which she took at the end of June. Gray was expected to reside at the flat, and Glading promised her that he would only arrive by appointment. On 11 October 1937, Glading instructed Gray to replace the gateleg table with a refectory table as the former had turned out not to be strong enough to bear the weight of the equipment. In the event, Glading bought one himself from Maple & Co. four days later, and it was installed on the 17th.", "By the end of 1937, a provisional case against Glading had been established. MI5 knew of his interest in the fourteen-inch heavy naval gun that was now in production at the Royal Arsenal, and that Whomack was removing the blueprints for it and bringing them to Holland Road for copying. The copying was done by Stevens in 42 exposures on the evening of 21 October 1937, and then the blueprint was returned over night or the next day. Although the men could be searched by the Arsenal's security on entry, even the simple expedient of folding the plans between a folded-up newspaper was sufficient to avoid detection on at least one occasion. Olga Gray, says Davenport-Hines, brewed a pot of tea for the group \"while the films were hung in the bathroom to dry\". Gray was later able\u2014by standing on the edge of the bath\u2014to surreptitiously note down the serial numbers of the pieces of blueprint. In November, Glading removed the camera to his own house in South Harrow. The following January, Glading informed Gray he had a major operation coming up. This was the copying, not just of a blueprint, but a 200-page manual. For this purpose, the security services laid on extra watchers at Glading's house, where the work was to take place. It began on 15 January; it must have been completed overnight, as the following day, Glading was observed taking a package to Charing Cross station. Meeting Charles Munday in the public lavatory, they adjourned to a nearby restaurant where the handover took place.", "After a seven-year operation, Olga Gray set Glading up for arrest. On 20 January he telephoned Gray at the safe house, asking her to meet him the next day. Glading took Gray out to lunch at the Windsor Castle bar to discuss a \"significant\" operation he had planned for 82 Holland Road that same night. He had brought a suitcase with him; she was to be at the safe house by 6:00\u00a0PM. William Duff quotes Glading as telling Gray that Glading had \"got the stuff parked all over London\"\u2014negatives of blueprints he kept at various locations\u2014and that he mentioned a pre-arranged meeting with someone that evening, again at Charing Cross. This was the cue the security services had been waiting for. Gray telephoned MI5 and duly reported what Glading had told her.", "Olga Gray, although she was able to give her evidence at Glading's trial anonymously, had been \"terrified\" at the prospect. Hennessey and Thomas have argued that, at this point, \"the reality of her role struck home: that she had effectively destroyed a man who had trusted her implicitly and of whom she had become extremely fond\"."]}]}}
