He chronicled his Kafiristan experience in the book The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush. Some have suggested that Robertson's year-long expedition and subsequent book (originally published in 1896) provided background and inspiration for Rudyard Kipling's short story \"The Man Who Would Be King\". However, Kipling's work was originally published in 1888, predating Robertson's travels to the region.", "link_mentions": {}}}
