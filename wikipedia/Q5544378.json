He chronicled his Kafiristan experience in the book The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush. Some have suggested that Robertson's year-long expedition and subsequent book (originally published in 1896) provided background and inspiration for Rudyard Kipling's short story \"The Man Who Would Be King\".

George Scott Robertson considered them to be part of the old Indian population of Eastern Afghanistan and stated they fled to the mountains while refusing to convert to Islam after the Muslim invasion in the 10th century. The name Kator was used by Lagaturman, last king of the Turk Shahi. The title \"Shah Kator\" was assumed by Chitral's ruler Mohtaram Shah who assumed it upon being impressed by the majesty of the erstwhile pagan rulers of Chitral.

Thus, it is but natural that some writers make mistakes in identifying these remnants of ancient Kambojas of the Pamirs/Hindukush with the Turks or the Hephthalites.There are even some noted scholars who identify the Kambojas as a branch of the Tukharas (See for example: Buddhism in Central Asia, 1987, p. 90, Dr B.

It narrates how Queen Victoria rules over nearly a quarter of the earth's land surface, with the brightest jewel in her crown being India. Yet the might of the Raj is not to go unchallenged in the high mountains of the Hindu Kush. The State of Chitral which had till then existed as a buffer between British and Russian spheres of influence and tilted towards the Government of India in the second half of the 19th century, with the death of the Mehtar of Chitral in 1892 descends into civil war. A small British force led by Surgeon-Major George Scott Robertson is caught up in the Fort at Chitral which was to come under siege for seven weeks while a relief force was organised. The book narrates the follies of a vanished age."]}]}}
