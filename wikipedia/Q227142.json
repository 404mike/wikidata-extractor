After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member of the company and found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors.Hordern, p. 144. Writing in his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote: \"Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land.\"Hordern, p. 145. Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose,\"The Slipper and the Rose\", British Film Institute, accessed 18 February 2016. and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre.\"Jumpers\", The Spectator, 1 October 1976, p. 28.
