A versatile forward, he was used by Arsenal in every attacking position, including striker and a Winger. Although he only made his Arsenal debut midway through his first season, against Sunderland on 28 December 1907, he finished the 1907-08 season as the club's second-top goalscorer, with eight, one behind Peter Kyle.\nFor the next two seasons Lewis featured regularly, playing the majority of Woolwich Arsenal's matches. However, at the time the club were struggling in the First Division, skirting relegation in 1909-10 (finishing 18th out of 20), before financial problems forced the club to sell its best players. Arsenal finished bottom of the First Division in 1912-13 having only scored 18 League goals; Lewis was Arsenal's top scorer that season, albeit with only four goals.\nBy now, Lewis mainly played as a supporting striker; this combined with Arsenal's poor attacking form meant he scored relatively few goals for the club. He faithfully stayed with the club (which in the meantime had moved to Highbury and renamed themselves \"The Arsenal\"), as they battled for promotion from the Second Division. The arrival of World War I robbed Lewis of the peak of his career; although he played in some wartime matches, by the time peace had broken out and Arsenal had returned to Division One in 1919, he was 33. He played in five League matches in 1919-20 before dropping down to the reserves.\nLewis left Arsenal in 1921, having played 220 times for the club, scoring 34 goals. He played for Margate before retiring. He died aged 80, in 1967.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Lewis", "response": ["Charles Lewis may refer to:", "*Charles Lewis (Australian politician) (1870\u20131935), Australian politician", "*Charles Lewis (cyclist) (born 1968), Belizean cyclist", "*Charles Lewis (footballer) (1886\u20131967), English football player", "*Charles Lewis (rugby union) (1853\u20131923), Welsh rugby international", "*Charles Lewis (sculler) (died 1863), winner of the Wingfield Sculls in 1831 and 1833", "*Charles Lewis (New Zealand politician) (1857\u20131927), New Zealand politician", "*Sir Charles Lewis, 1st Baronet (1825\u20131893), Member of Parliament for Londonderry City, 1872\u20131886, and North Antrim, 1887\u20131892", "*Charles Lewis (soldier) (1733\u20131774), Virginian colonel killed in the Battle of Point Pleasant, namesake of Lewis County, West Virginia", "*Charles Lewis (painter) (1753\u20131795), English still life painter", "*Charles Lewis Jr. (1963\u20132009), co-founder of Tapout clothing", "*Charles Lewis (bookbinder) (1786\u20131836), English bookbinder", "*Charles Lewis African American Veteran who was lynched on December 16, 1918", "*Charles Lewis (journalist) (born 1953), founder of the Center for Public Integrity"]}, {"page": "List of Arsenal F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Charles Lewis"]}, {"page": "Lewis (surname)", "response": ["*Charles Lewis (journalist) (born 1953), founder of the Center for Public Integrity", "*Charles Lewis (footballer) (1886\u20131967), English football player"]}, {"page": "David Neave", "response": ["By then, Neave had been made to share the left wing position with Charles Lewis; he had only played in half the matches of Arsenal's 1909-10 campaign.

He had a run of seven league matches, counting the visit of Aston Villa abandoned because of bad light, before Charles Lewis took over at outside left and David Greenaway returned to the side on the right wing."]}]}}
