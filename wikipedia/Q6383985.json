In those days the MCC saw tours as a means of encouraging overseas cricket and strengthening the ties that bound the Commonwealth. Lord Cobham gave a speech in which he reminded the team that it was more important to not disgrace the face of English cricket even at the cost of series, though several young players had other ideas about this.p6, Tyson The party was a large one of 18 players, Denis Compton suffered a recurrence of his knee trouble which had plagued him on the 1950-51 tour and required remedial surgery. Yorkshire's \"Farmer Vic\" Wilson was a surprise choice as his replacement and Compton was later flown out to join the team in Australia. The other 17 were seen off by family, friends and well-wishers on the Orsava. Frank Tyson saw \"a spare, stooped old man, dressed immaculately in a pin-stripe suit\" telling the young Colin Cowdrey, \"when you reach Australia, just remember one thing - hate the bastards!\". He spoke with such vehemence that Tyson asked George Duckworth who the old gent was, \"That was Douglas Jardine\", the reason behind Lord Cobham's speech on good sportsmanship. They travelled first class on the Orsova, which took six weeks to arrive in Western Australia, after stopping for a one-day game against Ceylon. Unused to the lavish fare and freed of rationing, the players soon added weight and Frank Tyson increased his weight from 161 lbs (73\u00a0kg) to 182\u00a0lbs (83\u00a0kg).p12, Tyson Unfortunately for the Australians he exercised regularly so the extra weight was turned into muscle.

Strangely every batsman in the Queensland team except the absent Lindwall got into double figures, but none of them made fifty and they were out for 288. Mick Harvey made 49 and thrashed a ball into Jim McConnon's groin, a painful injury that put the unlucky spinner out of contention for weeks. Alex Bedser still had his unexplained rash, but bowled 31 eight ball overs for 2/56 and Brian Statham and Trevor Bailey both took 3/74. The MCC made 288 as well in their second innings despite being 8/2 when the makeshift opener Colin Cowdrey and wicket-keeper Keith Andrew batting at number 3 were out for ducks. Simpson made 38, but it was May (77), Compton (69) and Bailey (51 not out) who made the runs as no bowler took more than 2 wickets. There was no time to consider a run chase, but Simpson surprised everybody when his off-spinners took 2/5 to leave Queensland on 25/2.90-97, Tyson", "Some of the oldest grade clubs in Australia are in Tasmania, but it was a weak state side that did not fully complete in the Sheffield Shield for another twenty years.

Thanks to the Third Test a record 20,000 spectators turned out on the small Hobart ground to watch. The Tasmanian captain Emerson Rodwell won the toss and batted only to see Favell out for a duck, thanks to Alec Bedser (3/56) as the ball swung heavily. Peter Loader (4/81) took two more wickets and Benaud was caught off \"Big Al\" to leave them 72/4, but Harvey (82) and Rodwell (72) added 60 before Trevor Bailey (3/29) reduced 132/4 to 146/7. Rodwell added another 54 runs with Terence Cowley (12) before Bailey caught him off Bedser, Loader took the last two wickets and the Combined XI were out for 221. This looked good as the tourists now fell to the swing bowling of Alan Davidson (4/45) as they collapsed to 167/7 with Denis Compton making 46. Bailey stuck around for 53 and Bedser took the score up to 242 with 19. The Combined XI batted again, but waited until they were 184/6 before Rodwell declared, with Neil Harvey 47 and Richie Benaud 68 not out. The unlucky Jim McConnon broke his little finger when fielding a powerful Harvey on-drive, as it would take until the end of the tour to mend he was sent home when they reached the mainland.
