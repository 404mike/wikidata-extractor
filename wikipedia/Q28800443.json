Bogle was recalled by his parent club, fringe players Luke Maxwell and Dan Scarr moved on, Viv Solomon-Otabor and Steve Seddon loaned out, and Stewart was recalled from Kilmarnock and loaned to Aberdeen instead.

A bid of \u00a312\u00a0million from Burnley was the highest reported. The Times suggested that a refusal to sell might constitute a further aggravated breach of the P&S rules. It also emerged that the restriction also applied to extending the contracts of existing players, which had particular relevance to team captain Michael Morrison whose contract was due to expire at the end of the season.", "| 8 January 2019 || Luke Maxwell || Solihull Moors || Undisclosed", "| 2 July 2018 || Luke Maxwell || Solihull Moors || 5 January 2019"]}, {"page": "Maxwell, Luke", "response": ["#redirectLuke Maxwell"]}]}}
