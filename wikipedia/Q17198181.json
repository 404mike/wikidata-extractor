In August 2015 George Hamilton, the PSNI chief constable, stated that the IRA no longer exists as a paramilitary organisation. He said that some of its structure remains, but that the group is committed to following a peaceful political path and is not engaged in criminal activity or directing violence. However, he added that some members have engaged in criminal activity or violence for their own ends. The statement was in response to the recent killings of two former IRA members. In August Kevin McGuigan was shot dead, believed to be a revenge killing by former IRA members over the shooting death of former Belfast IRA commander Gerard Davison three months earlier. The chief constable stated there was no evidence that the killing of McGuigan was sanctioned by the IRA leadership. In response, the British government commissioned the Assessment on Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland, which concluded in October 2015 that the IRA, while committed to peace, continued to exist in a reduced form."]}, {"page": "Police Service of Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Sir George Hamilton"]}, {"page": "Order of precedence in Northern Ireland", "response": ["#The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (George Hamilton)"]}, {"page": "George Hamilton", "response": ["George Hamilton may refer to:", "* George Hamilton (musician) (1901\u20131957), father of the actor George Hamilton", "* George Hamilton IV (1937\u20132014), American country music performer", "* George Hamilton (actor) (born 1939), American actor", "* George Hamilton (Resident Evil), fictional character in the video games Resident Outbreak File #1 and File #2", "* Sir George Hamilton, Comte Hamilton (est. 1635 \u2013 1676), Irish soldier in French service", "* George Hamilton (soldier) (aft. 1658 \u2013 aft. 1728), Scottish soldier, Member of Parliament for Anstruther Burghs, and Jacobite", "* George FitzGeorge Hamilton (1898\u20131918), British Army officer", "* Sir George Hamilton, 1st Baronet, of Donalong (c. 1607\u20131679), Irish baronet", "* George Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Abercorn (c. 1636 \u2013 bef. 1683), Scottish nobleman", "* George Hamilton, 4th Baron Hamilton of Strabane (1636/7 \u2013 1668), Irish peer", "* George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney (1666\u20131737)", "* George Hamilton (MP for Wells) (c. 1697\u20131775), Member of Parliament for Wells and for St Johnstown, Donegal", "* George Hamilton (1732\u20131793), MP for Belfast", "* George Hamilton (1732\u20131796), MP for Augher", "* George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen (1784\u20131860), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1852\u20131855", "* Lord George Hamilton (1845\u20131927), British politician", "* Sir George Hamilton, 1st Baronet (1877\u20131947) of Ilford, British politician", "* George Hamilton (city founder) (1788\u20131836), Canadian politician and founder of Hamilton, Ontario", "* George Hamilton (footballer) (1917\u20132001), Scottish footballer", "* George Hamilton (broadcaster) (born 1951), association football commentator with RT\u00c9", "* Eppie Hamilton (George Hamilton, born 1900), American baseball player", "* George Hamilton (moderator) (1635\u20131712), moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1699", "* George Hamilton (canon) (1718\u20131787), Canon of Windsor", "* George Hamilton (priest) (1823\u20131905), Archdeacon of Lindisfarne and of Northumberland", "* George Hamilton (lumber baron) (1781\u20131839), lumber baron in the Ottawa Valley", "* George Hamilton (Australian police officer) (1812\u20131883), senior South Australian police commissioner", "* George Hamilton (police officer) (born 1967), Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland from 2014"]}, {"page": "Cressida Dick", "response": ["Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe subsequently ousted her from her position as the MPS's counterterrorism head after their relationship became strained.Vikram Dodd, Cressida Dick walking a tightrope over policing of Sarah Everard vigil, The Guardian (14 March 2021).
