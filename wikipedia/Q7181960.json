She pointed out that private screening companies could make claims such as, \u201cwe\u2019ve saved thousands of lives\u201d, in advertising materials, irrespective of whether these claims were grounded in evidence. McCartney has shown that the outcomes of these evidence-free, private screenings, which were not sanctioned by the UK National Screening Committee,  often resulted in an additional burden for the National Health Service. McCartney has argued that 'sexed up' medicine; in which people make medical decisions based on overselling, incomplete information and unfair claims, is bad of people's health. As part of her campaigning efforts, she contacted the Advertising Standards Authority, who upheld her complaints on the use of misleading information and non-evidence based inspections. In 2016 McCartney joined Phil Hammond for a month long show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where the pair urged the audience to protect the National Health Service from \"market mayhem\"."]}]}}
