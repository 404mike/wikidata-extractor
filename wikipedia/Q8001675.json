The game ended in a goalless draw, forcing a replay at The Dell four days later which the Saints won, thanks to Rawlings' second brace in the competition. Wilf Phillips missed a penalty during the game for the hosts. In their second FA Cup semi-final in three years, the club faced First Division side Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, the home of Chelsea. The Gunners took the lead following an own goal by Saints right-back Ted Hough, and doubled their lead later through Charlie Buchan. Rawlings pulled one back for the Second Division side late on, before the game was shrouded in controversy. According to Southampton director A. A. Wood, the team were denied three penalties in the final minutes of the game. In the words of one London-based newspaper, there was at least one \"palpable\" penalty ignored by the referee which \"robbed\" Southampton of their first place in an FA Cup final in 25 years."]}]}}
