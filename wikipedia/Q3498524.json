The Streets of Ankh-Morpork, the first Discworld map, was co-designed by Briggs and Pratchett and painted by Stephen Player in 1993. This was followed by The Discworld Mapp (1995), also painted by Stephen Player, and A Tourist Guide to Lancre (1998), painted by Paul Kidby.\nBriggs also adapted over 20 Pratchett novels for the amateur stage \u2013 Wyrd Sisters, Mort, and Guards!
