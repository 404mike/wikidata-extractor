At a British Supersport round in September, Hutchinson crashed in wet conditions soon after the start suffering a badly broken left leg after being hit by a following rider's machine. The leg-break needed many surgical operations and much time to recover. He again fractured the leg in 2012 when riding an off-road bike practicing exhibition-riding for a motorcycle show at the Excel Arena in London.Returning to racing with modifications to his race machines involving changing the gear-lever to the right side and fitting a thumb-operated rear brake instead of a footbrake lever, in 2013 he won the Macau Grand Prix.\nIn 2015 he had a dramatic return to top form with three wins, a second and third places at the 2015 Isle of Man TT races riding PBM Kawasaki (1000 cc) and Team Traction Control Yamaha (600 cc) machines, which contributed to his overall points tally, winning the Joey Dunlop TT Championship Trophy for 2015.He also competed in selected rounds of the 2015 British Superbike Championship on the Kawasaki ZX-10R.\nHutchinson was placed sixth in his last race on the PBM Kawasaki at the Macau Grand Prix in November 2015. For 2016, he was contracted to ride Tyco BMWs for the Superbike and Superstock classes, with a return to Keith Flint's Team Traction Control Yamahas for the Supersport class at North West 200, Isle of Man TT, and Ulster Grand Prix.In 2017, Hutchinson crashed during a race on the Isle of Man breaking his thighbone. Subsequent races on the Isle of Man in 2018 were not successful, with three DNFs together with places at 11 and 16, and three DNFs in 2019.Prior to becoming a professional road-racer Hutchinson worked as a motorcycle mechanic for the late Colin Appleyard, MBE.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isle of Man TT", "response": ["|Ian Hutchinson", "| Classic TT Trophy || Ian Hutchinson || Yamaha YZF-R6 || Metzeler || 2016 || ", "| Joey Dunlop Trophy || Ian Hutchinson || BMW S1000RRYamaha YZF-R6 || 2016", "| TT Supporters' Club Trophy || Ian Hutchinson|| Yamaha YZF-R6 || 2016"]}, {"page": "Keith Flint", "response": ["Flint was a keen motorcyclist.
