He attended Peter Maxwell Davies' composition classes at the Dartington Summer School of Music, and co-founded the Cardiff Composers' Ensemble while a student there. In the 1970s he co-founded, with James Clarke, the ensemble Suoraan, which specialised in performances of music by contemporary composers, including Iannis Xenakis, Michael Finnissy and James Dillon.\nIn 2002, M\u00e9tier released a CD of Emsley's music, entitled Flowforms.\nIn addition to composing, Emsley works as a music engraver.
