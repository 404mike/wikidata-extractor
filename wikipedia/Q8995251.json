However, for the second successive season Leeds finished fourth and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals, this time losing 1\u20130 to Everton at Old Trafford. They finally won major honours by beating Arsenal 1\u20130 in the final of the League Cup; Terry Cooper scored the only goal of the game despite allegations that Charlton pushed goalkeeper Jim Furnell in the build-up to the goal. Leeds then went on to lift the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after beating CA Spora Luxembourg, FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland) and Dundee (Scotland) to reach the final with Hungarian club Ferencv\u00e1rosi.
