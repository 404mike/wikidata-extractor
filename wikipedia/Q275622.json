Prior to the 1930s, the majority of archaeological work taking place in British Palestine was biblical archaeology focused on historic periods, and little was known about the region's prehistory. In 1928, Garrod was invited by the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (BSAJ) to excavate Shuqba cave, where prehistoric stone tools had been discovered by P\u00e8re Mallon four years earlier. She discovered a layer sandwiched between the Upper Palaeolithic and Bronze Age deposits characterised by the presence of microliths. She identified this with the Mesolithic, a transitional period between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic which was well-represented in Europe but had not yet been found in the Near East. A year later, when she discovered similar material at el-Wad Terrace, Garrod suggested the name \"the Natufian culture\", after Wadi an-Natuf that ran close to Shuqba. Over the next two decades Garrod found Natufian material at several of her pioneering excavations in the Mount Carmel region, including el-Wad, Kebara and Tabun, as did the French archaeologist Ren\u00e9 Neuville, firmly establishing the Natufian culture in the regional prehistoric chronology. As early as 1931, both Garrod and Neuville drew attention to the presence of stone sickles in Natufian assemblages and the possibility that this represented a very early agriculture."]}, {"page": "Rosalind Franklin", "response": ["Franklin's letter to her parents in January 1939 is often taken as reflecting her own prejudiced attitude, and the claim that she was \"not immune to the sexism rampant in these circles\". In the letter, she remarked that one lecturer was \"very good, though female\". Maddox maintains that was a circumstantial comment rather than an example of gender bias, and that it was a expression of admiration because, at the time, woman teachers of science were a rarity. In fact, Maddox says, Franklin laughed at men who were embarrassed by the appointment of the first female professor, Dorothy Garrod.Maddox, p. 48."]}, {"page": "Imagery intelligence", "response": ["American personnel had for some time formed an increasing part of the CIU and on 1 May 1944 this was finally recognised by changing the title of the unit to the Allied Central Interpretation Unit (ACIU).

Garrod discovered Neanderthal and early modern human remains, including the skeleton of a Neanderthal female, named Tabun I, which is regarded as one of the most important human fossils ever found.Christopher Stringer, custodian of Tabun I, Natural History Museum, quoted in an exhibition in honour of Garrod; Callander and Smith, 1998 The excavation at el-Tabun produced the longest stratigraphic record in the region, spanning 600,000 or more years of human activity. The four caves and rock-shelters (Tabun, Jamal, el-Wad, and Skhul) together yield results from the Lower Paleolithic to the present day, representing roughly a million years of human evolution. There are also several well-preserved burials of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens and the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer groups to complex, sedentary agricultural societies is extensively documented at the site. Taken together, these emphasize the paramount significance of the Mount Carmel caves for the study of human cultural and biological evolution within the framework of palaeo-ecological changes.\""]}, {"page": "Newnham College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Dorothy Garrod"]}, {"page": "1892 in archaeology", "response": ["*May 5 - Dorothy Garrod, English Palaeolithic archaeologist of the Near East (died 1968)."]}, {"page": "1937 in archaeology", "response": ["* Dorothy Garrod - The Stone Age of Mount Carmel: excavations at the Wady el-Mughara."]}, {"page": "1926 in archaeology", "response": ["* Dorothy Garrod finds 'Gibraltar 2', fossilized components of a Neanderthal child's skull, in excavations at the Devil's Tower rock shelter on Gibraltar."]}, {"page": "Creswellian culture", "response": ["The Creswellian is a British Upper Palaeolithic culture named after the type site of Creswell Crags in Derbyshire by Dorothy Garrod in 1926.
