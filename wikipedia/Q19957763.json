Professor David Feldman, director of the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, argues that Holocaust inversion is often not antisemitic because it is a commonly used rhetorical device \"used in many arguments about many subjects, often light-mindedly, lacking any specifically antisemitic content\", such as Israeli politicians who refer to each other as Nazis, and because the inversion (in relation to the 2014 Gaza war) is not motivated by an anti-Jewish subjectivity but by criticism of Israeli policy. Extrapolating from a 2011 study which found that a substantial minority of respondents agreed with the statement that \"Israel is carrying out a war of extermination against the Palestinians\", Manfred Gerstenfeld concluded that some 150 million, out of 400 million, European Union (EU) citizens espouse a view that demonizes Israel.
