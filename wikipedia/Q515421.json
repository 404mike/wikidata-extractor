There was, though, another resurgence in sword and sorcery at the end of the 20th century. Sometimes called the \"new\" or \"literary\" sword and sorcery, this development places emphasis on literary technique, and draws from epic fantasy and other genres to broaden the genre's typical scope. Stories may feature the wide-ranging struggles of national or world-spanning concerns common to high fantasy, but told from the point of view of characters more common to S&S, and with the sense of adventure common to the latter. Writers associated with this include Steven Erikson, Joe Abercrombie, and Scott Lynch, magazines such as Black Gate and the ezines Flashing Swords (not to be confused with the Lin Carter anthologies), and Beneath Ceaseless Skies publish short fiction in the style.  According to the literary critic Higashi Masao, of Japanese works, Guin Saga and Sorcerous Stabber Orphen were initially planned by their authors as novels that could be classified as belonging to the European sword and sorcery subgenre. but later Guin Saga volumes center too much around conspiracy, while Sorcerous Stabber Orphen is only officially published in light novel format, and its later development involved increased reliance on magic and elements of high fantasy."]}, {"page": "List of fantasy authors", "response": ["* Joe Abercrombie, (born 1974) author of The First Law series"]}, {"page": "Lancaster, Lancashire", "response": ["*Joe Abercrombie (born 1974) \u2013 fantasy writer and film editor, was born in Lancaster and attended LRGS."]}, {"page": "Lascelles Abercrombie", "response": ["Abercrombie was the brother of architect and noted town planner Patrick Abercrombie.
