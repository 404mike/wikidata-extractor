He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cambridge and Bachelor of Science from University of London in 1887. He was awarded Master of Arts degree from Cambridge in 1891 and D.Sc. degree from London in 1898. He won scholarships from his school and universities that covered most of the cost of his education and his move from Cambridge to London was prompted by a vacancy for a salaried position as an assistant in the Botanical Department of the British Museum. This made him focus on systematic botany for his career, focusing on gymnosperms, monocotyledons,\nand the Apetalae. In 1894 he obtained a lectureship at The Birkbeck Institute, teaching during the evenings.\nHe was Keeper of Botany at the Natural History Museum from 1906 to 1930, in succession to George Robert Milne Murray.\nIn 1905, Rendle attended the International Botanical Congress in Vienna, where he was appointed on to the editorial committee for the International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature (now superseded by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants and the International Code of Nomenclature for Bacteria) a role which he continued in until 1935.\nRendle published a number of books.  Perhaps the best known of these was The Classification of Flowering Plants, which saw a gap of over 20 years between the publication of its two volumes \u2013 the first was published in 1904, but readers had to wait until 1925 for volume two.  This long gap was attributed by Rendle to his \"increasing official and non-official duties\".  These included acting as botany editor for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, published in 1911, editor of the Journal of Botany (1924 \u2013 1938), and revising the 7th edition Handbook of British Flora (1924, author G. Bentham).\nRendle was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1916 to 1921 and president of the Linnean Society from 1923 to 1927. he had been a Fellow of the Linnean Society since 1888, and was its secretary 1916 \u2013 1923.\nHis contemporaries considered that he had a keen sense of duty which he brought to his roles at the British Museum and contribution to the scientific community.  His teaching focused on delivering fundamental knowledge to undergraduates rather than advanced study.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brassicaceae", "response": ["Carl Linnaeus in 1753 regarded the Brassicaceae as a natural group, naming them \"Klass\" Tetradynamia. Alfred Barton Rendle placed the family in the order Rhoedales, while George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker in their system published from 1862\u20131883, assigned it to their cohort Parietales (now the class Violales). Following Bentham and Hooker, John Hutchinson in 1948 and again in 1964 thought the Brassicaceae to stem from near the Papaveraceae. In 1994, a group of scientists including Walter Stephen Judd suggested to include the Capparaceae in the Brassicaceae. Early DNA-analysis showed that the Capparaceae\u2014as defined at that moment\u2014were paraphyletic, and it was suggested to assign the genera closest to the Brassicaceae to the Cleomaceae. The Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae diverged approximately 41 million years ago. All three families have consistently been placed in one order (variably called Capparales or Brassicales). The APG II system, merged Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae. Other classifications have continued to recognize the Capparaceae, but with a more restricted circumscription, either including Cleome and its relatives in the Brassicaceae or recognizing them in the segregate family Cleomaceae. The APG III system has recently adopted this last solution, but this may change as a consensus arises on this point. Current insights in the relationships of the Brassicaceae, based on a 2012 DNA-analysis, are summarized in the following tree."]}, {"page": "List of Old Olavians", "response": ["* Alfred Barton Rendle FRS, Botanist"]}, {"page": "List of systems of plant taxonomy", "response": ["*:Alfred Barton Rendle.
