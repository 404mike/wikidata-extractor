He was a right-handed batsman who played first-class cricket for Marylebone Cricket Club and Sussex. He was born in Rajahmundry and died in Wormit.\nAnstruther made his debut in the 1873 season, playing for the MCC, though it wasn't until almost exactly a year later he made his next first-class appearance. Anstruther made six appearances for the MCC in total, before moving to play with Sussex.\nAnstruther made his first appearance for Sussex in 1878, playing as captain and making the highest score of his debut Sussex innings. However, his team lost the match by an innings margin. He played four further games for the team that season, though his Sussex team failed to win a single one.\nFollowing this, Anstruther played in just two first-class matches, both for the MCC, the first in 1880, and the final one seven years later.\nAnstruther's nephew, Robert Anstruther, played one first-class match in the 1910\u201311 season.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
