He employed Watson to take apart the buildings, muster up the remaining cattle and overland them to Macartney's other property at Auvergne Station on the Victoria River in the north-western region of the Territory. The stock-routes in the Northern Territory that drovers such as Watson utilised to transport cattle were known places of violence. After interviewing Watson about them, the Administrator of the Northern Territory, Charles Dashwood, came to the conclusion that the drovers \"shot the blacks down like crows along the route\". Before heading out from Darwin to shutdown Florida Station, it was communicated to Watson that a number of Yolngu men were going to kill him. Reports emerged that Watson was speared to death while dismantling Florida in 1893 but these proved to be false."]}]}}
