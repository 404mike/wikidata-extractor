Rex.While working for the local Tax office, Currie played with local Grimsby group \"The Rumble Band\". He joined T. Rex (recently renamed from Tyrannosaurus Rex) as bass guitarist in November 1970 (although the band were still listed as a duo) and continued to play with them until late 1976.\nHe appeared on all of Marc Bolan's hit singles from \"Hot Love\" (1971) to \"Laser Love\" (1976), as well as the albums Electric Warrior (1971) to Dandy in the Underworld (1977). His innovative and, for the time, sophisticated bass playing can be seen to good effect in the movie Born to Boogie.After leaving T. Rex, he went into session work, working for Chris Spedding.\nHe died in a car crash on 28 April 1981, while returning to his home near Vale de Parra, Algarve, Portugal. Steve Currie is commemorated with a memorial plaque on the steps at Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 20", "response": ["*1947 \u2013 Steve Currie, English bass player (d. 1981)"]}, {"page": "List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees", "response": ["| Marc Bolan, Steve Currie, Mickey Finn, and Bill Legend"]}, {"page": "1981 in music", "response": ["*April 28 \u2013 Steve Currie, bassist of T.Rex, 33 (car crash)"]}, {"page": "1947 in music", "response": ["*May 20 \u2013 Steve Currie (T.

Rex by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist Steve Currie and drummer Bill Legend, and cutting a five-minute single, \"Hot Love\", with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by \"Hey Jude\". Bolan performed \"Hot Love\" on Television BBC show Top of the Pops wearing glitter on his face: the performance was later recognized as the foundation of glam rock. For the viewers, it was a defining moment: \"Bolan was magical, but also sexually heightened and androgynous\". The song was number one for six weeks and was quickly followed by \"Get It On\", a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song, re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" when released in the United States, reached No. 10 in the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1972, the only top 40 single the band had in the US. When performing \"Get it On\" on Top of the Pops, Bolan wore bigger glitter teardrops under the eyes, along with a shiny jacket."]}, {"page": "Grimsby", "response": ["*Steve Currie (1947\u20131981) bass player and long-term member of the English glam rock band T.

Inspired by a Hawkwind gig he attended, Gray started learning bass guitar at the age of 13, his playing influenced by bassists such as Steve Currie, Lemmy, John Entwistle, Felix Pappalardi and Roger Glover. He joined Eddie and the Hot Rods as bassist after answering an advert in the Southend Evening Echo. The band had several hit singles and albums in the late 1970s, including \"Do Anything You Wanna Do\". While working with Eddie and the Hot Rods, he also recorded bass for Larry Wallis, Rob Tyner and Johnny Thunders, as well as filling in as temporary bassist for The Members. In early 1980, following the departure of Graeme Douglas, Gray left Eddie and the Hot Rods and, on the insistence of Captain Sensible and Rat Scabies, joined the punk rock band The Damned, replacing former bassist Algy Ward. Gray contributed to two studio albums, The Black Album and Strawberries, as well as numerous singles and the Friday 13th EP. Frictions in the band led to Gray's departure in February 1983.  Shortly afterwards, he joined UFO and remained until their split in 1987."]}, {"page": "The Slider", "response": ["* Steve Currie \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Futuristic Dragon", "response": ["* Steve Currie \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Tanx", "response": ["* Steve Currie \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Currie (surname)", "response": ["* Steve Currie (1947\u20131981), bassist for T.
