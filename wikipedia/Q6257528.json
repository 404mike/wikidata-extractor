In the second edition of his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1568), Giorgio Vasari used maniera in three different contexts: to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term maniera greca to refer to the medieval Italo-Byzantine style or simply to the maniera of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality.Cheney 1997, 17. Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as \"la maniera moderna\", or the \"modern style\".Briganti 1961, 6. James V. Mirollo describes how \"bella maniera\" poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch.Mirollo 1984,  This notion of \"bella maniera\" suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, \"bella maniera\" utilized the best from a number of source materials, synthesizing it into something new.", "As a stylistic label, \"Mannerism\" is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt and popularized by German art historians in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century \u2013 art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. \"High Renaissance\" connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur and the revival of classical antiquity. The term \"Mannerist\" was redefined in 1967 by John ShearmanShearman 1967. following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by Fritz Grossmann at Manchester City Art Gallery in 1965.Grossmann 1965. The label \"Mannerism\" was used during the 16th century to comment on social behaviour and to convey a refined virtuoso quality or to signify a certain technique. However, for later writers, such as the 17th-century Gian Pietro Bellori, la maniera was a derogatory term for the perceived decline of art after Raphael, especially in the 1530s and 1540s.Smyth 1962, 1\u20132.

Nevertheless, the series was criticised from within the academy for its evident biases. Many of its authors were German \u00e9migr\u00e9s, consequently there was a methodological preference for the kunstwissenschaft practiced in Vienna and Berlin between the wars; a formalism that ignored the social context of art.The point of view maintained at the Courtauld, for example: \"After the war many older art historians took the view that the primary tasks of art history had already been accomplished, and that the time had come for summaries. This was the platform from which Pevsner launched his Pelican History of Art project, but it was not how the situation was perceived at the Institute.\" \"A History of the Courtauld\".
