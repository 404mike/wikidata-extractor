As a student, he earned extra cash illustrating learned academic papers and designing menus, toast lists and illuminated addresses, and during national service he drew cartoons for the official army magazine Soldier.He originally invented Littlenose to entertain his children, but failed to find a publisher until BBC commissioned him to both write and present his stories of a little Neanderthal boy who was always getting into trouble. These proved a great success, and he went on to write and illustrate over 13 Littlenose books between 1968 and 1993.\nGrant died in Edinburgh on 23 February 2014, leaving his wife Elizabeth, children Euann, Niall, Kirsty and Andrew, as well as six grandchildren.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*John Grant (1930\u20132014) \u2013 Little Nose stories"]}, {"page": "1968 in literature", "response": ["*John Grant \u2013 Littlenose (first in the Littlenose series of 15 books)"]}, {"page": "Jackanory", "response": ["*John Grant (55 programmes reading his Littlenose stories)"]}, {"page": "Ultra Magnus", "response": ["Ultra Magnus appeared in the 1986 Ladybird Books story Decepticon Hideout by John Grant."]}, {"page": "Jazz (Transformers)", "response": ["Jazz was featured in the 1985 Transformers audio books Autobots' Lightning Strike and Autobots Fight Back by John Grant, published by Ladybird Books."]}, {"page": "John Grant", "response": ["John Grant may refer to:", "* John Grant (author) (1949\u20132020), pseudonym used by science fiction writer Paul Le Page Barnett", "* John Grant (children's author) (1930\u20132014), Scottish writer and illustrator known for the Littlenose series", "* John Grant (novelist) (born 1933), writes under the pen name Jonathan Gash", "* John Grant (pipe-major) (1876\u20131961), Scottish bagpipe player", "* John Grant (musician) (born 1968), lead vocalist with The Czars", "* John Grant (screenwriter) (1891\u20131955), wrote for Abbott and Costello", "* John Grant (born 1960), pseudonym Jock Strap, vocalist with London punk band The Straps", "* John Grant, character in Action for Slander", "* John Grant, character in Wake in Fright", "* John Grant (Royal Navy officer) (1908\u20131996), Rear Admiral who commanded the Reserve Fleet of the Royal Navy", "* John Grant (British diplomat) (born 1954), British diplomat and head of the UK's Mission to the European Union", "* John Grant (British politician) (1932\u20132000), British Labour and SDP Member of Parliament", "* John Grant (Gunpowder Plot) (c. 1570\u20131606), one of the conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot", "* John Grant (Manchester politician), Manchester councillor for Whalley Range", "* John Grant (Australian politician) (1857\u20131928), Australian Senator", "* John Grant (Queensland politician) (born 1954), member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 2012 to 2015", "* John Grant (Canadian politician) (1841\u20131919), Scottish-born merchant and political figure in British Columbia", "* John Grant, 13th Earl of Dysart (born 1946), Scottish peer, landowner and conservationist", "* John Grant (American football) (born 1950)", "* John Grant (Scottish footballer) (1931\u20132021)", "* John Grant (footballer, born 1891), English", "* John Grant (footballer, born 1981), English", "* John Grant (rugby league) (born 1950), Australian", "* John Grant (cricketer) (born 1941), Australian", "* John Grant Jr. (born 1974), Canadian lacrosse player", "* John Grant (priest) (fl. 1731\u20131744), Archdeacon of Barnstaple", "* John Grant (neurosurgeon) (1922\u20132013), neurosurgeon and disability sport administrator"]}, {"page": "Scorponok", "response": ["Scorponok appeared in the 1988 Ladybird Books story Decepticons at the Pole by John Grant.
