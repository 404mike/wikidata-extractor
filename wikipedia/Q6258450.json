One such unit was the 3rd Manchester Rifles, which soon had five companies at 'Henry's', Cheetham Hill, Knott Mill, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and Newton Heath. 'Henry's' Company was raised by employees of A. & S. Henry, with Major John Snowdon Henry as the first commanding officer (CO) of the 3rd Manchesters. In December 1859 men connected with newspapers and publishing formed a Manchester Press Company, which enlisted 200 men, and another company was formed at Prestwich. The 3rd Manchesters were formally adopted on 29 February 1860 as the 40th (3rd Manchester) Lancashire RVC, and the whole unit paraded at Chetham's College Yard in April, when Major Henry announced that its motto would be 'Defence not Defiance'.Beckett, Appendix VIIFrederick, p. 132.Westlake, Rifle Volunteers, pp. 145, 149.Lancashire Record Office Handlist 727th Manchesters at Regiments.org."]}]}}
