Some of the most controversial stories were written by Holmes himself. A scene from Holmes' story The Deadly Assassin, in which the Fourth Doctor's head is held under water as the cliffhanger, led to BBC Director General Sir Charles Curran apologising to Mary Whitehouse for the offence caused.Graeme Burk and Robert Smith Who's 50: The 50 Doctor Who Stories to Watch Before You Die\u2014An Unofficial Companion, Toronto: ECW Press, 2013, p.148-49 On 11 February 1977, the Daily Express published an interview with Holmes by Jean Rook under the title \"Who do you think you are, scaring my innocent child?\", in which Holmes said \"Parents would be terribly irresponsible to leave a six-year-old to watch it alone.
