In 1795, Schelling, as a precocious philosopher trying to construct a philosophy that would provide an \u2018immanentistic affirmation of the infinite\u2019 and undermine the strictures of dogma, dashed off a letter to his then close friend Hegel, enthusiastically confessing: \u2018I have become a Spinozist!\u2019. In 1881, Nietzsche himself, in a letter to Overbeck, remarked on Spinoza: \u2018I am amazed, delighted! I have a precursor, and what a precursor!\u2019, before listing his closeness to the fundamental tenets of Spinoza's thought. Marx himself, in his formative years, once composed an entire notebook consisting of a complete rearrangement of one of Spinoza's treatises, and then quixotically entitled it \u2018Tractatus Theologico-Politicus by Karl Marx\u2019.\" ('The Politics of Spinozism: Composition and Communication', Paper presented at the Cultural Research Bureau of Iran, Tehran, 4 January 2005)", "* Alberto Toscano: \"Though Spinozists have existed ever since the radical circles that rippled through Europe in the wake of Spinoza's death, I think it is fair to say that only in the past 50 years or so has there been a Spinozism to match in hermeneutic rigour and creative interventions the history of Kantianism or Hegelianism, that only now has the hereticism that Althusser referred to been complemented by the labour of the concept. Arguably, it is only now then that the scope of his thought and its relevance to our social and political existence can be truly appreciated, at a historical juncture when the communicative power of the multitude and of what Marx called the general intellect is so intensified that the physics, ethics, ontology and politics of Spinoza (what are ultimately indissociable facets of his philosophizing) can be thought simultaneously. Today more than ever, one might argue, is Spinoza, as Pierre Macherey puts it, \u2018an irreplaceable reactor and developer\u2019.\" ('The Politics of Spinozism: Composition and Communication', Paper presented at the Cultural Research Bureau of Iran, Tehran, 4 January 2005)", "* Alberto Toscano: \"That a Spinozist social science should be of French concoction is no coincidence: from the historical scholarship of Martial Gu\u00e9roult to Alexandre Matheron's pioneering study of the individual and community in Spinoza; from the centrality of Spinoza's materialism to the Althusserian project to Gilles Deleuze's radical re-working of his philosophy of immanence and the advances of contemporary scholarship, France has an altogether impressive tradition of Spinoza interpretation. At the heart of this retooling of a seventeenth-century metaphysics is the liquidation of the \u2018Cartesian\u2019 bourgeois-individual subject which supposedly animated the humanist visions of French phenomenology and existentialism. Althusser, of course, approached Spinoza's work philosophically\u2014as a detour, seeking grounds for a critique of idealism, en route to a properly materialist Marxist philosophy\u2014but also critically, noting for example its lack of a theory of contradiction. Lordon, by contrast, was looking for a conceptual framework through which to rethink social, economic and political life; Spinoza's work is only glancingly contrasted to that of his peers\u2014there is no \u2018outside\u2019 to his thinking here. Yet, as with Althusser or Deleuze, Lordon's perspective would remain anchored in the affirmation of Spinoza as the thinker who can emancipate us from the delusions of free will or untrammelled individual choice, allowing us to grasp human struggles for existence in a disabused materialist fashion.\" ('A Structuralism of Feeling?
