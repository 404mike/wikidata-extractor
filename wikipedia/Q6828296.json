During the marriage, Pat gave birth to two sons, David (Michael French) and Simon (Nick Berry), the latter of whom Pete believed to be his. Yet Pat could not settle down.

Pete was shell-shocked to discover that Simon, was not really his child, and that he was possibly the son of his brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). The storyline spanned several years, since the arrival of Pete's first wife Pat (Pam St. Clement) in 1986, until the long-awaited showdown between Pete, Pat and Kenny in February 1988. The episode written by Tony McHale contained shocking revelations that would affect several relationships on the Square for years to come. In the on-screen events, Simon was shown to bond with Kenny, despite Pat admitting that she did not know which of the Beale brothers had fathered Wicksy. A final plot twist mid-1988 saw Pat finally reveal what she thought was the truth, that Simon's real father was Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield), Pat's second husband and Wicksy's adoptive father. Despite this revelation on-screen, writer Colin Brake stated in an official EastEnders' book in 1994 that the true parentage of Simon was still uncertain in the minds of the producers. He stated, \"At various times over the years the story has been amended, until the only certainty is that we will never be certain about the actual facts.\" He added that, at the time of writing the book for EastEnders' 10th anniversary in 1994, \"the current producers believe that Pete was the father of [Simon's older brother] David and may have been the father of Simon.\""]}, {"page": "List of former EastEnders characters", "response": ["|Kenny Beale || Michael Attwell || 1988"]}, {"page": "The First Churchills", "response": ["*Henry St John: Michael Attwell"]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2006", "response": ["*Michael Attwell, 63, British actor."]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac episodes", "response": ["| Norman Wisdom, Michael Attwell, Sheila Ruskin, Elvi Hale, Jeff Rawle, Kevin Stoney, David Quilter, Penelope Lee, Roy Spencer"]}, {"page": "Simon Wicks", "response": ["Pat arrives in Walford, much to Pete's dismay, and tells Pete that he is not Simon's father.

As part of the original storyline, Wicksy's mother, Pat (Pam St Clement), was introduced as a major antagonist for the Beale family, when she announced that her former husband, Pete, was not Simon's biological father, as had previously been claimed. So began a long-running storyline played out throughout the year and continuing into 1988, which included other characters being implemented as the potential father of Simon, including Pete's older brother Kenny Beale (Michael Attwell). In the on-screen events, Simon was shown to bond with Kenny, despite Pat's admitting that she did not know which of the Beale brothers had fathered Wicksy.
