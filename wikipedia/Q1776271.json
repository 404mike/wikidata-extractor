Things didn't appear to get any easier to start June as the schedule read a quick trip up to Toronto to face the surging Reds who were enjoying their best start to a season in club history. They had tallied 12 of 12 home points and riding a four match unbeaten streak that consisted of three victories and one very impressive scoreless draw at Home Depot Center against the unstoppable Galaxy. Jimmy Nielsen kept the Wiz in the match long enough to allow referee Baldomero Toledo to send off TFC Defender Nick Garcia in the 27th minute. For the remainder of the first half the visitors enjoyed some attacking football but couldn't break down the defense and would have to settle for going to half up a man and even on the score sheet. Toledo's performance in the middle would be questioned by both sides before the game ended and in the 57th minute Craig Rocastle put himself in a position to be sent off and Toledo granted him the wish. The match would end scoreless with ten a side in what would repeatedly be called an uninspired performance by both sides but the point earned was the first road point for the club in 2010.", "|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Craig Rocastle"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["| Craig Rocastle"]}, {"page": "List of foreign EFL Championship players", "response": ["*Craig Rocastle \u2013 Sheffield Wednesday 2005\u201306"]}, {"page": "2010 MLS Expansion Draft", "response": ["|Eric Kronberg||Craig Rocastle||"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw Martin Foyle sign Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Keith Lowe on a season long loan, and both Paul Edwards and Craig Rocastle from Oldham Athletic.

Adam Eckersley then returned to the club after his release from Manchester United, as Sinnott's first non-loan signing. Sinnott then signed Dave Mulligan from Scunthorpe United on a short-term contract. Midfielder David Howland also arrived on loan from Birmingham City, and would join the club permanently at the end of the season. Fellow Birmingham player Krystian Pearce also signed on loan, though would impress enough to win a longer stay with Birmingham. Sinnott then raided another Birmingham club, this time Aston Villa, to bring Australian teenager Chris Herd on a one-month loan, as well as Swedish youngster Tobias Mikaelsson. He also allowed Rocastle to join Gillingham on a two-week loan. Sinnott also completed the signings of Chasetown pair Chris Slater and Kyle Perry, who left their jobs to become full-time professional footballers.
