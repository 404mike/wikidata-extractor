He received the same number of votes as another candidate, Lieutenant-Colonel John Montgomery Templeton, with the returning officer declaring Templeton the winner on his casting vote. Kennedy then lodged a petition with the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, alleging irregularities in the electoral process (the Devenish booth had received no electoral roll), and also that Templeton held an office of profit under the crown as a member of the Victorian militia and an official liquidator. In November 1893, the Committee of Elections and Qualifications declared the election in Benalla and Yarrawonga void, although it also ruled that liquidator was not an office of profit under the crown. A by-election was held on 20 November, which Kennedy won."]}, {"page": "1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours", "response": ["*Colonel John Montgomery Templeton, commanding the Militia Infantry Brigade in the Colony of Victoria."]}]}}
