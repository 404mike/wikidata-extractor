Griffiths, it was found that just over one in five gamers (21%) said they preferred socializing online to offline. Significantly more male gamers than female gamers said that they found it easier to converse online than offline. It was also found that 57% of gamers had created a character of the opposite gender, and it is suggested that the online female persona has a number of positive social attributes.Hussain, Zaheer (2008), Gender Swapping and Socializing in Cyberspace: An Exploratory Study"]}, {"page": "Free-to-play", "response": ["In single-player games, another concern is the tendency for free games to constantly request that the player buy extra content, in a similar vein to nagware and trialware's frequent demands for the user to 'upgrade'. Payment may be required in order to survive or continue in the game, annoying or distracting the player from the experience. Some psychologists, such as Mark D. Griffiths, have criticized the mechanics of freemium games as exploitative, drawing direct parallels to gambling addiction."]}, {"page": "The Truman Show delusion", "response": ["In 2008, Paolo Fusar-Poli from the British Journal of Psychiatry conducted a study that displayed individuals having signs of delusion.

Griffiths, professor of gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University, has repeatedly called for more regulation of sites like MadBid, but the UK's Gambling Commission has stated that it does not believe that such sites involve gambling, and while the Office of Fair Trading has worked against other sites which utilise automatic bidding against customers, it says it has nothing to add to the work already done."]}, {"page": "Violence and video games", "response": ["Some scholars suggested that the APA's policy statement ignored discrepant research and misrepresented the scientific literature. In 2013 a group of over 230 media scholars wrote an open letter to the APA asking them to revisit and greatly amend their policy statement on video game violence, due to considering the evidence to be mixed.
