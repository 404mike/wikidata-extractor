Approximately one twentieth of the collection is displayed and the remainder in storage but available for study by interested persons. Much of the collecting was done in the second half of the 19th century and among the collections are the David Homfray collection from the Cambrian and Ordovician strata of Wales and the collections of George H. Hickling and D. M. S. Watson from the Silurian of the Dudley district, West Midlands and from the Old Red Sandstone. Other specimens include the fossilised plants of the Coal Measures, the S. S. Buckman collection of ammonites, an ichthyosaur from Whitby and 40,000 mammalian bones from an excavation at Creswell Crags, Derbyshire and the David Forbes World Collection of minerals. Since the 1920s there has been a policy of complementary collecting by the museum and the university Department of Geology by which the museum specialises in hard rock petrology.The Manchester Museum.

Not convinced by this, Wright concluded that the tooth, in view of its sharpness, belonged to a carnivorous reptile of unknown affinities.Wright, T. (1852).

In 1846 he worked with David Forbes and William Hallowes Miller on crystallised slags. In 1847 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and served on the council from 1857 to 1859. In 1851 he was elected Fellow of the Geological Society, and was appointed lecturer on metallurgy at the newly founded Metropolitan School of Science in London, under Sir Henry Thomas de la Beche; the post was later made a professorship. Percy exerted influence, while holding this position, on metallurgy as a discipline, and through his pupils. The silver process was the only metallurgical one he actually invented, but his work suggested others; and the Gilchrist-Thomas process for making Bessemer steel from iron ores containing phosphorus was an outcome of his work, and was discovered by pupils."]}, {"page": "List of burials at Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["* David Forbes FRS (1828\u20131876)"]}]}}
