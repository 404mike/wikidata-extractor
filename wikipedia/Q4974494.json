Kym Marsh who plays Michelle Connor confirmed the storyline in June 2012, Marsh said: \"Ryan's been off doing his own thing, and has got heavily involved in drugs. Michelle expected him to come back as the same kid he was before he went away, but that's not going to happen.\" Asked how difficult this experience will be for Michelle, the actress replied: \"Very hard. Michelle's got her work cut out trying to get Ryan back on the straight and narrow, but we'll see her get support from outside influences.\" Speaking of the storyline Sol Heras said: \"It's a very serious storyline but in the real world it does happen. As long as it's done professionally and done well, it's great. I think it'll be good for young people to see the consequences that come from drugs. You'll see that the drugs are the reason that Ryan is falling out with everyone and causing trouble. There's a loneliness to Ryan because no-one really trusts him. It just shows that it's a bad way to go.\" Speaking of being compared to Ben Thompson (who previously portrayed Ryan) he said: \"Ryan is not the way he was before and he's picked up bad habits, so that's enabled me to come in and essentially be a fresh character, He's changed so much that I didn't have to stick to how the previous actor had played him, which really helps when you're coming into a new show.\""]}, {"page": "Dennis Tanner", "response": ["In May 2011, teenage couple Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) and Sian Powers (Sacha Parkinson) volunteer at a soup kitchen for homeless people where they meet Dennis, unaware of his past and that he used to live on the street.
