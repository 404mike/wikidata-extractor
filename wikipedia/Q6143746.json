A round arm fast bowler, he took 534 of his 540 first-class wickets for Surrey. Subsequently he became an umpire, appearing in that role between 1873 and 1899, but in only two matches before 1877. He umpired in one Test Match, that between England and Australia at The Oval on 11 and 12 August 1890.\nHe did not become a regular in the Surrey side until 1868, and even after he had established himself his bowling figures were not especially good by the standards of the time. His best seasons were 1872 and 1873, when he took 60 wickets at an average of 15.11 and then 70 at 17.57.\nHis brother, George Street, and his son, Alfred Street, were both umpires, his son also playing for Surrey as well as surpassing his father by umpiring in seven Tests.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["Following a brilliant season in 1864 when the team won eight and drew three of its eleven first-class matches, Surrey went into free-fall in the latter half of the 1860s, owing to the decline of key players Caesar, Stephenson and Mortlock and a puzzling inability to find quality bowlers to support the incomparable James Southerton,Baily\u2019s Magazine of Sports and Pastimes, Volume 17 (1870) p. 25 whose combination with wicket-keeper Ted Pooley virtually carried the team.Baily\u2019s Magazine of Sports and Pastimes, Volume 19 (1871); pp. 98\u2013100 Although Southerton broke many bowling records and Harry Jupp developed into the most prolific scorer among professional batsmen, Surrey's record in purely county matches during the seventeen seasons from 1866 to 1882 was 59 victories, 107 losses, two ties and 37 drawn games.Wynne-Thomas, Peter; The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records; p. 53  The team bottomed out in 1871 when they did not win a single county match for the only time until 2008. Southerton, except in 1872 when fast bowler James Street helped him to win seven of twelve games, had no adequate support in bowling after underarm left-arm spinner George Griffith declined, and except when Richard Humphrey achieved prominence in 1872 the batting depended almost entirely on Jupp. The fielding was also generally below the standard expected of first-class cricket."]}, {"page": "William Barton (New Zealand cricketer)", "response": ["Born in England, Barton was educated at Cranleigh School in Surrey, where he was coached at cricket by the professional players Harry Jupp and James Street. He migrated to New Zealand on the ship St Leonards, arriving in November 1877, and worked for the Bank of New Zealand, first in Wanganui, then in Auckland from 1882, in Blenheim from early 1888, in Whangarei from late 1888, in Kaikoura from 1895, then as manager of the Rangiora branch from 1906.

Surrey batted first and were bowled out for 161, largely due to George Strachan who took 5/45. Grace opened the Gloucestershire first innings with his brother E. M. but both were dismissed cheaply and Gloucestershire had to recover from a position of 7\u20132 to make 315, half-centuries being scored by Charles Gordon, Fred Grace and Robert Miles. James Street took 7/141 for Surrey. Batting again, Surrey needed 154 to avoid the innings defeat but were bowled out for 94 by E. M. and W. G.

He averaged 78.25 and the next best average by a batsman playing more than a single innings was 39.57, barely more than half his figure. His aggregate for the season was 2,739 and this was the first time that anyone had scored 2,000 first-class runs in a season; Harry Jupp was next best with 1,068.
