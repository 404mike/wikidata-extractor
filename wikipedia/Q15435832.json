When mixed with sulphuric acid, the coprolite forms a fertiliser.O'Connor (2001) pp. 46\u201357 One author attributes the Stretham coprolite pit, in Little Thetford, as being owned by John Bailey Denton, 1814\u20131893, the surveyor and civil engineer. The site was worked from 1866. Mainly local labour was used in shovelling the coprolite from the pit, for washing and sorting. In 1871, six\u00a0percent of the population of Little Thetford worked at the pit. The coprolite was transported to the James Fison (now Fisons Ltd) factory in Thetford, Norfolk, by river and then onwards by railway.Grove (1976) pp. 36\u201343"]}, {"page": "Josiah Parkes", "response": ["A Birmingham manufacturer on Parkes's suggestion produced in 1844 the first set of drain-cutting implements, and in 1843 John Reade, a self-taught mechanic, invented a cylindrical clay pipe as a cheap conduit for the water. Sir Robert Peel in 1846 helped finance drainage on Parkes's principle. Parkes, though, had less success with practical projects, was touchy, and rejected innovations in his field by John Bailey Denton and others. His last major work was for the War Department: the draining, forming and fixing of sea slopes in the fortifications at Yaverland and Warden Point, Isle of Wight, from 1862 to 1869. Immediately afterwards he retired from business. "]}, {"page": "Denton (surname)", "response": ["* John Bailey Denton (1814\u20131893), English surveyor, and civil engineer"]}, {"page": "J.
