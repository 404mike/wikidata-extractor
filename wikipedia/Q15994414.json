Dr Simpson and two of his assistants, Dr George Skene Keith (1819-1910) and James Matthews Duncan (1826-1890), used to sit every evening in Dr Simpson's dining room to try new chemicals to see if they had any anaesthetic effect. Following a visit to Linlithgow, where Simpson was recommended to trial a sample of chloroform from a local pharmacist, David Waldie, Simpson then returned to Edinburgh. On 4 November 1847, Simpson and his friends decided to try chloroform themselves, which Simpson had obtained from local pharmacist William Flockhart of Duncan and Flockhart of North Bridge, Edinburgh. On inhaling the chemical they found that a general mood of cheer and humour had set in, but suddenly all of them collapsed only to regain consciousness the next morning. Simpson knew, as soon as he woke up, that he had found something that could be used as an anaesthetic. They soon had Miss Petrie, Simpson's niece, try it. She fell asleep soon after inhaling it while singing the words, \"I am an angel!\". There is a prevalent myth that the mother of the first child delivered under chloroform christened her child \"Anaesthesia\"; the story is retailed in Simpson's biography as written by his daughter Eve. However, the son of the first baby delivered by chloroform explained that Simpson's patient had been one Jane Carstairs, and her child was baptised Wilhelmina. \"Anaesthesia\" was a nickname Simpson had given the baby."]}, {"page": "Charlotte Square", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"James Matthews Duncan\"|Dr James Matthews Duncan then Prof William Rutherford Sanders"]}, {"page": "James Duncan", "response": ["*James Matthews Duncan (1826\u20131890), Scottish physician"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| James Matthews Duncan||07/06/1883||April 1826 \u2013 1 September 1890"]}, {"page": "Robert Barnes (physician)", "response": ["A leading teacher and gyn\u00e6cologist in London, Barnes was a rival of James Matthews Duncan both in debates at the Obstetrical Society,  and in practice.
