A year later Elliott reached three semi-finals with Bolton, who were now managed by Sam Allardyce.

In the same year, he acquired experience abroad with a successful loan spell at Haka of the Finnish Veikkausliiga, winning both the Finnish championship and the Finnish Cup. In 1999, he had a further loan spell with Ipswich Town, scoring one goal against Bury in six appearances. Harewood went on to forge a reputation as one of the most lethal strikers in the First Division. He scored 51 goals in 124 league games and 58 substitute appearances for Forest and also scored four goals in 23 cup appearances. He formed a brilliant attacking partnership with close friend David Johnson. They scored 50 goals between them, of which Harewood netted 21 goals including 4 in one game against Stoke City, to fire Paul Hart's Forest into the playoffs for the 2002\u201303 season. He caught the eye of West Ham fans when he scored for Forest in an FA Cup Third Round clash at Upton Park on 4 January 2003. However, Harewood's contract was due to expire in summer 2004 and having been offered a worse contract than he was already on, rejected it and decided to leave."]}, {"page": "Richard Naylor", "response": ["Born in Leeds, West Yorkshire, Naylor graduated through the Ipswich Town youth academy and played for Ipswich for 14 years.

Naylor came on as a first-half substitute for the injured David Johnson, and was widely credited at the time for changing the shape of the match in Ipswich's favour, scoring one and setting up another sending Ipswich back into the Premier League for the first time since 1995."]}, {"page": "David Johnson (Jamaican football player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Johnson (footballer, born 1976)"]}, {"page": "Steel City derby", "response": ["* David Johnson"]}, {"page": "John Thompson (footballer, born 1981)", "response": ["Thompson made his full debut for Nottingham Forest against Sheffield United in 2002 at Bramall Lane in a 0\u20130 draw, with a man of the match performance .

Forest's fortunes took a downturn largely caused by a mass exodus of players during the previous summer. Taylor played a big part in the recovery with some very important goals. His first goal for Forest came against his former club Burnley at Turf Moor, where Nottingham Forest won 3\u20130.

This paid off with Grabban once again finishing as Forest's top scorer, becoming the first Forest striker to score 20 goals in a single season since David Johnson and Marlon Harewood both achieved that feat during the 2002\u201303 season. He received particular praise for the increase in his work rate, with Lamouchi saying \"Lewis is so crucial for us. If he is running like that, fighting like that and working hard for the team ... we can achieve anything\"."]}]}}
