This time Davies' half-back partner was Llanelli team mate David Morgan. The Welsh selectors often favoured less able half-back pairing which came from the same club team, giving a level of continuity to the back play. Morgan was first capped in the last game of the 1895 tournament, a home win over Ireland. Morgan was retained, while his partner Ralph Sweet-Escott was dropped to allow Davies another chance. Played away at Rectory Field in Blackheath, Wales were completely outclassed, losing 25-0. Neither Morgan or Davies were ever selected for Wales again."]}, {"page": "David Morgan (rugby union)", "response": ["Morgan first played international rugby when he was selected for the final game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship in a game against Ireland. Morgan was brought in as a replacement for Cardiff's Selwyn Biggs and was paired at half back with another Cardiff player, Ralph Sweet-Escott. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales faced Ireland in a 'wooden spoon' decider, with both countries having already lost against England and Scotland. Wales won the game 5-3, thanks to an inventive try from Tom Pearson. The next season the Welsh selectors kept faith with Morgan bringing him into the team for the opening game of the 1896 Championship. This time the selectors chose a Llanelli pairing, bringing in Ben Davies, to whom this was also his second international. The match was a sporting disaster for Wales, losing 25-0, and although the forwards took the brunt of the blame, the selectors also reacted by dropping both Morgan and Davies, neither of whom ever represented Wales again."]}, {"page": "Sweet-Escott", "response": ["* Ralph Sweet-Escott (1869\u20131907) English rugby union player"]}]}}
