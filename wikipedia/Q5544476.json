Shaw was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm off break.  He was born in Treharris, Glamorgan.\nShaw made his first-class debut for Glamorgan against the Combined Services in 1951.  He made 15 further first-class appearances for Glamorgan, the last of which came against Surrey in the 1955 County Championship.  A bowler, Shaw took 26 wickets for Glamorgan, at an average of 27.15, with best figures of 5/38.  These figures came in his second first-class match against the Combined Services in 1952, a match in which he also took his other five-wicket haul of 5/67, to give him match figures of 10/105.  Typically though, he found it harder against county professionals.He emigrated to Australia in 1978, where six years later he was killed in a car crash outside Port Pirie, South Australia, on 2 August 1984.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Shaw", "response": ["George Shaw may refer to:", "* George Shaw (biologist) (1751\u20131813), English botanist and zoologist", "* George Shaw (academic dress scholar) (1928\u20132006), biologist and British expert on academic dress", "* George Shaw (artist) (born 1966), English contemporary artist", "* George Shaw (Australian politician) (1913\u20131966), member of the Australian House of Representatives", "* George Shaw (civil servant), Lieutenant Governor of the British Crown Colony of Burma, 1913", "* George Shaw (composer), musician and film composer", "* George Shaw (Tasmanian politician) (born 1932), member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council", "* George Shaw (architect) (1810\u20131876), English architect", "* George Shaw (American football) (1933\u20131998), American football quarterback", "* George Shaw (cricketer, born 1839) (1839\u20131905), English cricketer", "* George Shaw (cricketer, born 1931) (1931\u20131984), Welsh cricketer", "* George Shaw (footballer, born 1877) (1877\u20131954), Australian rules footballer in the 1890s", "* George Shaw (footballer, born 1886) (1886\u20131971), Australian rules footballer in the 1910s", "* George Shaw (footballer, born 1899) (1899\u20131973), English football player", "* George Shaw (footballer, born 1969), Scottish football player & manager of Forfar", "* George Shaw (triple jumper) (1931\u20131988), American Olympic athlete", "* Slotch Shaw (George Shaw, 1865\u20131928), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* George Shaw (1951\u20131955) : G.
