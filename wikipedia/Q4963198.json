He played at representative level for Great Britain, England and Yorkshire, and at club level for Stanley Rangers, York, Huddersfield, St. Helens (Heritage No. 749) and Wakefield Trinity (Heritage No. 665), as a second-row, i.e. number 11 or 12, during the era of contested scrums.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wakefield Trinity", "response": ["Wakefield Trinity was invited to visit South Africa during June and July 1962. Neil Fox, Harold Poynton, Gerry Round, Derek 'Rocky' Turner and Jack Wilkinson, were unable to accompany the team on the six-match tour, as they were in Australia with the GB tourists. Wakefield Trinity's Chairman Stuart Hadfield was also touring with the national team as Great Britain manager. Trinity therefore added four South African players who were playing for British clubs at that time to their squad. They were Fred Griffiths (Wigan), Tom van Vollenhoven (St. Helens), Wilf Rosenberg (Hull F.C.) and Edward \"Ted\" Brophy (Leigh). Wakefield had three South Africans of their own in the squad in Alan Skene, Jan Prinsloo and Colin Greenwood, with the rest of the party made up of Fred Smith, Ken Hirst, Ken Rollin, Keith Holliday, Dennis Williamson, Milan Kosanovi\u0107, Geoff Oakes, Brian Briggs, Albert Firth and Don Vines. It was some squad so, not surprisingly; they were comfortable winners of all six matches. The tour opened on Saturday 30 June 1962 at Milner Park, Johannesburg, where the local Johannesburg Celtic club were overpowered by 52\u20136."]}, {"page": "List of St Helens R.F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"  |Brian Briggs"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain national rugby league team players", "response": ["* Brian Briggs circa-1954"]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Northern Rugby Football League season", "response": ["|11|| Brian Briggs"]}, {"page": "Brian Briggs (disambiguation)", "response": ["Brian Briggs (1932\u20131996) was an English rugby league footballer.", "*Brian Briggs (musician), English musician", "*Brian Briggs, founder of BBspot"]}, {"page": "1958\u201359 Lancashire Cup", "response": ["|Charlie Winslade||11||Brian Briggs"]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 Lancashire Cup", "response": ["|||11||Brian Briggs"]}, {"page": "1957 Yorkshire Cup", "response": ["|Brian Briggs||11||Basil Watts"]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 Yorkshire Cup", "response": ["|Brian Briggs||11||Don Devereux"]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Yorkshire Cup", "response": ["|Brian Briggs||11|||Jack Fairbank"]}, {"page": "Briggs, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Briggs"]}]}}
