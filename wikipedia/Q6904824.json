His family emigrated to England when he was a child. He played in 3 One Day Internationals for England and in 359 first-class matches.Lynch was a hard-hitting batsman, an occasional off-spin bowler and a fine slip fielder. Lynch played in the County Championship for Surrey between 1977 and 1994, and for Gloucestershire from 1995 to 1998.\nLynch played one season for Guyana in the 1982\u201383 Shell Shield 4-day competition. He also played for the unofficial West Indies team on the rebel tour of South Africa the following season.\nMonte Lynch was picked for England and played in three One Day Internationals versus the West Indies in 1988, but after scores of 0, 2 and 6 he was not picked again.Since retiring from first-class cricket he has continued to play club cricket in Surrey and started his own sporting goods company, MAL Skills. He was the cricket coach at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and then the coach of the Southern Rocks cricket team in Zimbabwe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "South African rebel tours", "response": ["The participants received a life ban from Caribbean cricket in 1983. In many instances, they were ostracised socially and professionally, such was the hostility toward players that complied with the South African apartheid system.Pg 120, Michael Holding and Tony Cozier, Whispering Death: The Life and Times of Michael Holding, 1993 In contrast, the players commented on a warm reception from both blacks and whites in South Africa and the tour may have been a positive influence on relations between races. It was one of the few occasions when white and black people had played sport together in South Africa. The players' bans were lifted in 1989 (although Monte Lynch appeared in ODI's for England a year earlier against the touring West Indians) but the only tour member who played for West Indies again was Moseley, at the age of 32 (two tests in the 1989\u201390 home series against England: though he did not take many wickets, his appearance was chiefly notable for breaking Graham Gooch's hand, forcing Gooch \u2013 now England's captain \u2013 to miss the remainder of the series). Franklyn Stephenson and Clarke had very successful first-class careers in South African and English domestic cricket: and Stephenson in particular could perhaps be thought unlucky not to be given a chance in Test cricket, given the precedent set by Moseley's selection and the fact that his performances in the English county championship had been nothing short of spectacular.", "*1983-4 squad: Lawrence Rowe (captain), Hartley Alleyne, Faoud Bacchus, Sylvester Clarke, Colin Croft, Alvin Greenidge, Bernard Julien, Alvin Kallicharran, Collis King, Monte Lynch, Everton Mattis, Ezra Moseley, David Murray, Derick Parry, Franklyn Stephenson, Emmerson Trotman, Albert Padmore (player/manager)."]}, {"page": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1988", "response": ["In reply, Graham Gooch and Chris Broad had a confident start and made an opening partnership of 70 before Broad was caught by Greenidge off Marshall's bowling.  With the West Indies focus on restricting Gatting, Gooch was able to progress relatively unhindered but was dismissed for 43 by Ambrose, caught by Harper, and England were 119 for two.  Then, described by Mike Selvey, writing in The Guardian, as a \"loony period of kamikaze running\", Monte Lynch was run out on his debut while both Gatting and Lamb narrowly avoided a similar fate. The latter was bowled by Hooper on 11, with England then 153 for four.  Gatting, partnered by Pringle, made his fifty, and guided England to the total required with two overs to spare, winning the match by six wickets.  Small was named man of the match for what Selvey described as \"inspired bowling\"."]}, {"page": "David Banks (cricketer, born 1961)", "response": ["Banks remained at Worcestershire for a couple more years, but scored only two more half-centuries (both in first-class games) and when 1986 came around he was playing in the Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire. Although more of his matches were minor, the NatWest Trophy afforded him the chance of List A games occasionally. In June 1988 Staffordshire played Surrey at Burton upon Trent, and although they lost the game they put in a creditable performance thanks largely to Banks. He scored 62*, his only List A half-century, and took the wickets of Alec Stewart and Monte Lynch.

Somerset captain Rose won the toss on an overcast morning and chose to field first. Heavy rain in the week leading up to the match meant that the outfield was slow, making scoring difficult early in the day. Surrey started slowly; after the first ten overs they were seven for one, having lost Jack Richards. They added another eight runs in the next eight overs, and lost their other opener, Grahame Clinton. Somerset's bowlers were partly credited for the start; Ian Botham was extracting a lot of swing from some of his deliveries, while the Times journalist John Woodcock praised Joel Garner as being \"notoriously difficult to get away\". Geoff Howarth, one of Surrey's overseas players, was described as \"out of form\" in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack summary of the match, and scored 16 runs. Early in his innings, the Surrey captain Knight struggled against Somerset's fast-medium pace bowlers; he frequently missed balls which passed outside his off stump, but he settled in against the slower bowlers, and scored 92 runs before being caught behind off the bowling of Garner. In all, Garner collected five wickets; four of them coming towards the end of the innings. He also conceded fourteen runs from his eleven overs, the best economy rate of any bowler in the match; Scyld Berry of The Observer described him as \"the world's most dangerous bowler in the one-day game\". Monte Lynch and Sylvester Clarke both batted more aggressively for Surrey in the afternoon, when the sun helped make scoring a little easier, but neither batted long enough to make a significant impact on the score: Lynch struck a six and two fours during his 22, while Clarke scored 15 before being caught by a diving effort from Popplewell. Surrey completed their 55 overs on 194 for eight, setting Somerset a target of 195 runs to win.", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Monte Lynch "]}]}}
