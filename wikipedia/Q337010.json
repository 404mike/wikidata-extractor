Pele's singles never reached the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart, with it being often remarked that Pele sold more of their famous primary colour T-shirts than they did records. However they scored a number one single in South Africa with \"Megalomania\", and had other hits in Holland, Portugal and Belgium. After nine tours of the UK, including those with Del Amitri and The Pogues, they split in 1996 due to problems with the record company whose efforts to make Prowse record as a solo artist were resisted by the singer."]}, {"page": "Lord Michael Levy", "response": ["#redirect Michael Levy, Baron Levy"]}, {"page": "Hackney Downs School", "response": ["* Michael Levy, Baron Levy"]}, {"page": "Michael Levy", "response": ["*Michael Levy, Baron Levy (born 1944), British music industry executive and life peer"]}, {"page": "Amanda Delew", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Levy, Baron Levy"]}, {"page": "Lord Cashpoint", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Levy, Baron Levy"]}, {"page": "Baron Levy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Levy, Baron Levy"]}]}}
