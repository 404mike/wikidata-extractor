From the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, he was a prominent figure in the Soviet dissident movement, well known at home and abroad. He spent a total of twelve years in the psychiatric prison-hospitals, labour camps, and prisons of the Soviet Union.After being expelled from the Soviet Union in late 1976, Bukovsky remained in vocal opposition to the Soviet system and the shortcomings of its successor regimes in Russia. An activist, a writer, and a neurophysiologist, he is celebrated for his part in the campaign to expose and halt the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.A member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a director of the Gratitude Fund (set up in 1998 to commemorate and support former dissidents), and a member of the International Council of the New York City-based Human Rights Foundation, Bukovsky was a Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.In 2001, Vladimir Bukovsky received the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom, awarded annually since 1993 by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of the Soviet Union (1982\u20131991)", "response": ["* Soviet Archives collected by Vladimir Bukovsky"]}, {"page": "December 30", "response": ["*1942 \u2013 Vladimir Bukovsky, Russian author and activist (d. 2019)"]}, {"page": "Palestine Liberation Organization", "response": ["*Documents regarding the Soviet Ministry of Defense 1983 special operation requested by Yasir Arafat: delivery of two German-built coast guard cutters belonging to the PLO from Syria to Tunis \u2013 (PDF in Russian) from the Soviet Archives  collected by Vladimir Bukovsky"]}, {"page": "Tom Stoppard", "response": ["The accusations of favouring intellectuality over political commitment or commentary were met with a change of tack, as Stoppard produced increasingly socially engaged work. From 1977, he became personally involved with human-rights issues, in particular with the situation of political dissidents in Central and Eastern Europe. In February 1977, he visited the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries with a member of Amnesty International. In June, Stoppard met Vladimir Bukovsky in London and travelled to Czechoslovakia (then under communist control), where he met dissident playwright and future president V\u00e1clav Havel, whose writing he greatly admires. Stoppard became involved with Index on Censorship, Amnesty International, and the Committee Against Psychiatric Abuse and wrote various newspaper articles and letters about human rights. He was instrumental in translating Havel's works into English. Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1977), \"a play for actors and orchestra\" was based on a request by conductor/composer Andr\u00e9 Previn and was inspired by a meeting with a Russian exile.

Andropov headed the organisation which persecuted the most remarkable people of our country.\" From Petrov's point, it was a shame for the country that the persecutor of intelligentsia, the persecutor of freedom of thought, a man of whom as an oppressor of freedom legends were composed, became leader of the country. According to Roy Medvedev, the year that Andropov spent in power was memorable for increasing repression against dissidents. During most of his KGB career, Andropov crushed dissident movements, isolated people in psychiatric hospitals, sent them to prison and deported them from the Soviet Union. According to political scientist Georgy Arbatov, Andropov bears responsibility for many injustices in the 1970s and early 1980s: for deportations, for political arrests, for persecuting dissidents, for the abuse of psychiatry, for notorious cases such as the persecution of academician Andrei Sakharov. According to Dmitri Volkogonov and Harold Shukman, it was Andropov who approved the numerous trials of human rights activists such as Andrei Amalrik, Vladimir Bukovsky, Viacheslav Chornovil, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Alexander Ginzburg, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Petro Grigorenko, Anatoly Sharansky, and others."]}, {"page": "Samizdat", "response": ["* December 1970 report by KGB regarding \"alarming political tendencies\"in Samizdat and Preventive measures (from the Soviet Archives, collected by Vladimir Bukovsky)"]}, {"page": "2019", "response": ["** Vladimir Bukovsky, Russian-born British human rights activist and political dissident (b. 1942)"]}, {"page": "Great Purge", "response": ["While being the most visible part, the trials and executions of the former Bolshevik leaders were only a minor aspect of the purges.

The only hard evidence published was a discussion between Gorbachev and Bulgaria's Aleksandar Lilov from 23 May 1990 (after Iliescu's victory in the 20 May elections) in which Gorbachev says that Iliescu holds a \"calculated position\", and that despite sharing common views with Iliescu, Gorbachev wanted to avoid sharing this impression with the public."]}, {"page": "Wilfred Burchett", "response": ["During his return visits to Moscow in the early 1990s, veteran dissident Vladimir Bukovsky was given access by the Russian government to classified documents from the archives of the CPSU Central Committee.
