Scenes of Rihanna with her romantic interest (Dudley O'Shaughnessy) in both love and hate scenarios intersperse, as they experience mounting difficulties in their relationship. After enduring the overwhelming effects of recreational drugs and physical violence, she finds her boyfriend unconscious on the floor of his apartment, and leaves him, having had enough of the relationship. Images of the song's producer and featured artist Calvin Harris appear in outdoor DJ scenes, while the video has regular references to popular culture, such as themes of films and content of other singers' videos.", "Extras for the shoot were not told what was expected of them until the last minute, in order to keep the content of the video as secret as possible. Regarding the video's content, Rihanna posted a message on Twitter that read: \"I really can't stop thinking about this video we just shot! EASILY the BEST video I've done thus far!\" Rihanna elaborated on the concept of the video: \"We've never done a video like this before. This is probably one of the deepest videos I've ever done\u00a0... it's all about love and love being like a drug, you definitely get that from this.\" The male love interest in the video is Dudley O'Shaughnessy, a model and former boxer. Upon the release of the video, Matsoukas explained the content of the video in an interview with MTV:", "After the release of the video, critics commented on the resemblance between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound explained that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing \"The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps\". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, \"The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts\u00a0... you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you have the good.\" In conclusion, Goodman commented that  the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: \"during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?\"", "* Dudley O'Shaughnessy \u2015 starring role"]}, {"page": "England Boxing National Amateur Championships Welterweight Champions", "response": ["| 2010 || Dudley O'Shaughnessy || West Ham ABC"]}, {"page": "Joseph A Adesunloye", "response": ["thumb|Joseph a.
