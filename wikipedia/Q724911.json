In 1999 he joined Prodrive who had the works Ford contract, to help develop their Mondeo. Again he struggled in his first season while setting up the car.

The following year he won three races and finished second in the championship to Will Hoy, taking Vauxhall's first ever overall BTCC win. In 1992 Cleland battled with Hoy and Tim Harvey for the title, but was denied at the last round by a controversial collision with Steve Soper, the teammate of eventual champion Harvey.
