He was still there when, on 6 March, he had a further heart attack and died at the age of 56. The obituarist for The Times wrote that \"he was the amateur of the old smoking concert platform turned into a music-hall professional of genius\", while Donald Zec, writing in the Daily Mirror, called him \"as great an entertainer as any of the giants of the music-hall\". The Guardian considered that \"with his ukulele, his songs, and his grinning patter, the sum was greater than any of those parts: a Lancashire character\", while in the eyes of the public, Formby's \"passing was genuinely and widely mourned\"."]}, {"page": "Call Me Bwana", "response": ["When asked by journalist and close Broccoli affiliate Donald Zec if they had any ideas for their non-Bond film, Harry Saltzman, who had previously made The Iron Petticoat with Hope, suggested a Bob Hope movie.
