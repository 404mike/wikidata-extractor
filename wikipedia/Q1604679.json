Following his release in 1831, he went to Marseille in France, where he organized a new political society called La Giovine Italia (Young Italy), whose motto was \"Dio e Popolo\" (God and People), which sought the unification of Italy.Denis Mack Smith, Mazzini (1996).", "Denis Mack Smith argues that:", "In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Austria contested with Prussia the position of leadership among the German states.  The Kingdom of Italy seized the opportunity to capture Venetia from Austrian rule and allied itself with Prussia.Denis Mack Smith, Italy: a modern history (1969) pp 76\u201382.  Austria tried to persuade the Italian government to accept Venetia in exchange for non-intervention. However, on 8 April, Italy and Prussia signed an agreement that supported Italy's acquisition of Venetia, and on 20 June Italy issued a declaration of war on Austria. Within the context of Italian unification, the Austro-Prussian war is called the Third Independence War, after the First (1848) and the Second (1859).", "Revisionism of Risorgimento produced a clear radicalization of Italy in the mid-20th century, following the fall of the Savoy monarchy and fascism during World War II. Reviews of the historical facts concerning Italian unification's successes and failures continue to be undertaken by domestic and foreign academic authors, including Denis Mack Smith, Christopher Duggan, and Lucy Riall.  Recent work emphasizes the central importance of nationalism."]}, {"page": "Umberto II of Italy", "response": ["Umberto was born at the Castle of Racconigi in Piedmont. He was the third child, and the only son, of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and his wife, Jelena of Montenegro. As such, he became heir apparent upon his birth, since the Italian throne was limited to male descendants. Umberto was given the standard military education of a Savoyard prince.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 182\u2013183. During the crisis of May 1915, when Victor Emmanuel III decided to break the terms of the Triple Alliance by declaring war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he found himself in a quandary as the Italian Parliament was against declaring war; several times, the king discussed abdication with the throne to pass to The 2nd Duke of Aosta instead of Umberto.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 210\u2013211. The British historian Denis Mack Smith wrote that it is not entirely clear why Victor Emmanuel was prepared to sacrifice his 10-year-old son's right to succeed to the throne in favour of the Duke of Aosta.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 211.", "Umberto was brought up in an authoritarian and militaristic household and was expected to \"show an exaggerated deference to his father\"; both in private and public, Umberto always had to get down on his knees and kiss his father's hand before being allowed to speak, even as an adult,Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 272. and he was expected to stand to attention and salute whenever his father entered a room. Like the other Savoyard princes before him, Umberto received a military education that was notably short on politics; Savoyard monarchs customarily excluded politics from their heirs' education with the expectation that they would learn about the art of politics when they inherited the throne.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 271\u2013272.", "Umberto was the first cousin of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. He was accorded the title Prince of Piedmont, which was formalised by Royal Decree on 29 September. In a 1959 interview, Umberto told the Italian newspaper La Settimana Incom Illustrata that in 1922 his father had felt that appointing Benito Mussolini as Prime Minister was a \"justifiable risk\".Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 254.", "Umberto was educated for a military career and in time became the commander-in-chief of the Northern Armies, and then the Southern ones. This role was merely formal, the de facto command belonging to his father, King Victor Emmanuel III, who jealously guarded his power of supreme command from Il Duce, Benito Mussolini. By mutual agreement, Umberto and Mussolini always kept a distance. In 1926, Mussolini passed a law allowing the Fascist Grand Council to decide the succession, though in practice he admitted the prince would succeed his father.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 265.", "Following the Savoyards' tradition (\"Only one Savoy reigns at a time\"), Umberto kept apart from active politics until he was named Lieutenant General of the Realm. He made an exception when Adolf Hitler asked for a meeting. This was not considered proper, given the international situation; thereafter Umberto was more rigorously excluded from political events. In 1935, Umberto supported the war against the Ethiopian Empire, which he called a \"legitimate war\" that even Giovanni Giolitti would have supported had he still been alive.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 271. Umberto wanted to serve in the Ethiopian war, but was prevented from doing so by his father, who did however allow four royal dukes to serve in East Africa. Umberto conformed to his father's expectations and behaved like an army officer; the prince also always obediently got down on his knees to kiss his father's hand before speaking. However, Umberto privately resented what he regarded as a deeply humiliating relationship with his cold and emotionally distant father. Umberto's attitude toward the Fascist regime varied: at times he mocked the more pompous aspects of Fascism and his father for supporting such a regime, while at other times he praised Mussolini as a great leader.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 272\u2013273.", "Umberto shared his father's fears that Mussolini's policy of alliance with Nazi Germany was reckless and dangerous, but he made no serious move to oppose Italy becoming one of the Axis powers.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 287. When Mussolini decided to enter the Second World War in June 1940, Umberto hinted to his father that he should use the royal veto to block the Italian declarations of war on Britain and France, but was ignored.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 291. After the war, Umberto criticised the decision to enter the war, saying that Victor Emmanuel was too much under \"Mussolini's spell\" in June 1940 to oppose it. At the beginning of the war, Umberto commanded Army Group West, made up of the First, Fourth and the Seventh Army (kept in reserve), which attacked French forces during the Italian invasion of France. Umberto was appointed to this position by his father, who wanted the expected Italian victory to also be a victory for the House of Savoy, as the King feared Mussolini's ambitions.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 292. A few hours after France signed an armistice with Germany on 21 June 1940, the Italians invaded France. The Italian offensive was a complete fiasco, with Umberto's reputation as a general only being saved by the fact that the already defeated French signed an armistice with Italy on 24 June 1940. Thus, he was able to present the offensive as a victory. The Italian plans called for the Regio Esercito to reach the Rhone river valley, which the Italians came nowhere close to reaching, having penetrated only a few kilometres into France.", "After the capitulation of France, Mussolini kept Umberto inactive as an Army commander. In the summer of 1940, Umberto was to command a planned invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but Mussolini subsequently cancelled the invasion of Yugoslavia in favour of invading the Kingdom of Greece.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 293. In June 1941, supported by his father, Umberto strongly lobbied to be given command of the Italian expeditionary force sent to the Soviet Union, saying that, as a Catholic, he fully supported Operation Barbarossa and wanted to do battle with the \"godless communists\".Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 298. Mussolini refused the request, and instead gave Umberto the responsibility of training the Italian forces scheduled to participate in Operation Hercules, the planned Axis invasion of Malta. On 29 October 1942, he was awarded the rank of Marshal of Italy (Maresciallo d'Italia). During October\u2013November 1942, in the Battle of El Alamein, the Italo-German force was defeated by the British Eighth Army, marking the end of Axis hopes of conquering Egypt. The Axis retreated back into Libya. In November 1942, as part of the Battle of Stalingrad, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, which saw the Soviets annihilate much of the Italian expeditionary force in Russia and encircle the German 6th Army. The disastrous Italian defeats at Stalingrad and El Alamein turned Umberto against the war and led him to conclude that Italy must sign an armistice before it was too late. In late 1942, Umberto had his cousin, The 4th Duke of Aosta, visit Switzerland to contact the British consulate in Geneva, where he passed on a message to London that the King was willing to sign an armistice with the Allies in exchange for a promise that he be allowed to keep his throne.", "In the first half of 1943, as the war continued to go badly for Italy, a number of senior Fascist officials, upon learning that the Allies would never sign an armistice with Mussolini, began to plot his overthrow with the support of the King.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 300. Adding to their worries were a number of strikes in Milan starting on 5 March 1943, with the workers openly criticising both the war and the Fascist regime which had led Italy into the war, leading to fears in Rome that Italy was on the brink of revolution. The strike wave in Milan quickly spread to the industrial city of Turin, where the working class likewise denounced the war and Fascism.Gerhard Weinberg, A World in Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 485 The fact that during the strikes in Milan and Turin, Italian soldiers fraternised with the striking workers, who used slogans associated with the banned Socialist and Communist parties,  deeply worried Italy's conservative establishment. By this point, the successive Italian defeats had so psychologically shattered Mussolini that he become close to being catatonic, staring into space for hours on end and saying the war would soon turn around for the Axis because it had to, leading even his closest admirers to become disillusioned and to begin looking for a new leader.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 302. Umberto was seen as supportive of these efforts to depose Mussolini, but as Ciano (who had turned against Mussolini by this point) complained in his diary, the prince was far too passive, refusing to make a move or even state his views unless his father expressed his approval first.", "On 10 July 1943, in Operation Husky, the Allies invaded Sicily.Gerhard Weinberg, A World in Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 594 Just before the invasion of Sicily, Umberto had gone on an inspection tour of the Italian forces in Sicily and reported to his father that the Italians had no hope of holding Sicily.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 303. Mussolini had assured the King that the Regio Esercito could hold Sicily, and the poor performance of the Italian forces defending Sicily helped to persuade the King to finally dismiss Mussolini, as Umberto informed his father that Il Duce had lied to him. On 16 July 1943, the visiting Papal Assistant Secretary of State told the American diplomats in Madrid that King Victor Emmanuel III and Prince Umberto were now hated by the Italian people even more than Mussolini.Ellwood, David Italy 1943\u20131945, Leicester: Leicester University Press, 1985 p. 35. By this time, many Fascist gerarchi had become convinced that it was necessary to depose Mussolini to save the Fascist system, and on the night of 24\u201325 July 1943, at a meeting of the Fascist Grand Council, a motion introduced by the gerarchi Dino Grandi to take away Mussolini's powers was approved by a vote of 19 to 8.Gerhard Weinberg, A World in Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 597 The fact that the majority of the Fascist Grand Council voted for the motion showed just how disillusioned the Fascist gerarchi had become with Mussolini by the summer of 1943. The intransigent and radical group of Fascists led by the gerarchi Roberto Farinacci, who wanted to continue the war, were only a minority, while the majority of the gerarchi supported Grandi's call to jettison Mussolini as the best way of saving Fascism.", "On 25 July 1943, Victor Emmanuel III finally dismissed Mussolini and appointed Marshal The 1st Duke of Addis Abeba as Prime Minister with secret orders to negotiate an armistice with the Allies. Baron Raffaele Guariglia, the Italian ambassador to Spain, contacted British diplomats to begin the negotiations. The Duke of Addis Abeba went about the negotiations in a halfhearted way while allowing a massive number of German forces to enter Italy. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that Addis Abeba as Prime Minister \"...did almost everything as stupidly and slowly as possible\", as he dragged out the secret peace talks going on in Lisbon and Tangier, being unwilling to accept the Allied demand for unconditional surrender.Gerhard Weinberg, A World in Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 598 During the secret armistice talks, Addis Abeba told Count Pietro d'Acquarone that he thought he might get better terms if Victor Emmanuel abdicated in favour of Umberto, complaining that the armistice terms that the King wanted were unacceptable to the Allies.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 310. D'Acquarone told Addis Abeba to keep his views to himself as the King was completely unwilling to abdicate, all the more so as he believed that Umberto was unfit to be monarch.", "On 17 August 1943, Sicily was taken and the last Axis forces crossed over to the Italian mainland. On 3 September 1943, the British Eighth Army landed on the Italian mainland at Reggio Calabria while the U.S. 5th Army landed at Salerno on 9 September 1943, a few hours after it was announced that Italy had signed an armistice.Gerhard Weinberg, A World in Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 599 Adolf Hitler had other plans for Italy, and in response to the Italian armistice ordered Operation Achse on 8 September 1943, as the Germans turned against their Italian allies and occupied all of the parts of Italy not taken by the Allies.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 315\u2013316. In response to the German occupation of Italy, neither Victor Emmanuel nor Marshal The 1st Duke of Addis Abeba made any effort at organised resistance; they instead issued vague instructions to the Italian military and civil servants to do their best, and fled Rome during the night of 8\u20139 September 1943.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 316\u2013317. Not trusting his son, Victor Emmanuel had told Umberto nothing about his attempts to negotiate an armistice nor about his plans to flee Rome if the Germans should occupy it.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 318\u2013319. For the first time in his life, Umberto openly criticised his father, saying the King of Italy should not be fleeing Rome and only reluctantly obeyed his father's orders to go south with him towards the Allied lines. The King and the rest of the Royal Family fled Rome via a car to Ortona, to board a corvette, the Baionetta, that took them south. A small riot took place at the Ortona dock as about 200 senior-ranking Italian military officers, who had abandoned their commands and unexpectedly showed up, begged the King to take them with him. Almost all of them were refused permission to board, making the struggle to get to the head of the queue pointless.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 318 With the exceptions of Marshal Enrico Caviglia, General Calvi di Bergolo and General Antonio Sorice, the Italian generals simply abandoned their posts on the night of 8\u20139 September to try to flee south, which greatly facilitated the German take-over, as the Regio Esercito was left without senior leadership. On the morning of 9 September 1943, Umberto arrived with Victor Emmanuel and The Duke of Addis Abeba in Brindisi.", "In northern Italy, a guerrilla war began against the fascists, both Italian and German, with most of the guerrilla units fighting under the banner of the National Liberation Committee (Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale-CLN), who were very strongly left-wing and republican.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 336. Of the six parties that made up the CLN, the Communists, the Socialists and the Action Party were republican; the Christian Democrats and the Labour Party were ambiguous on the \"institutional question\", and only the Liberal Party was committed to preserving the monarchy, though many individual Liberals were republicans.M.L.K \"Republic versus Monarchy in Italy\" pp. 305\u2013313 from The World Today, Vol 2, Issue 7, July 1946 p. 307. Only a minority of the partisan bands fighting for the CLN were monarchists, and none were led by a prince of the House of Savoy. After the war, Umberto claimed that he wanted to join the partisans, and only his wartime duties prevented him from doing so. The Italian Royal Court relocated itself to Brindisi in the south of Italy after fleeing Rome. In the fall of 1943, many Italian monarchists, like Benedetto Croce and Count Carlo Sforza, pressed for Victor Emmanuel III to abdicate and for Umberto to renounce his right to the succession in favour of his 6-year-old son, with a regency council to govern Italy as the best hope of saving the monarchy.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 322\u2013323. Count Sforza tried to interest the British members of the ACC in this plan, calling Victor Emmanuel a \"despicable weakling\" and Umberto \"a pathological case\", saying neither were qualified to rule Italy. However, given the unwillingness of the King to abdicate, nothing came of it.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 323.", "At a meeting of the leading politicians from the six revived political parties on 13 January 1944 in Bari, the demand was made that the ACC should force Victor Emmanuel to abdicate to \"wash away the shame of the past\".Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 324. Beyond removing Victor Emmanuel, which everyone at the Congress of Bari wanted, the Italian politicians differed, with some calling for a republic to be proclaimed at once, some willing to see Umberto succeed to the throne, others wanting Umberto to renounce his claim to the throne in favour of his son, and finally those who were willing to accept Umberto as Luogotenente Generale del Regno () to govern in place of his father. Since northern and central Italy were still occupied by Germany, it was finally decided at the Bari conference that the \"institutional question\" should be settled only once all of Italy was liberated, so all of the Italian people could have their say.", "As the Allies freed more and more of Italy from the Sal\u00f2 Republic, it became apparent that Victor Emmanuel was too tainted by his previous support of Fascism to have any further role. A sign of how unpopular the House of Savoy had become was that on 28 March 1944, when the Italian Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti returned to Italy after a long exile in the Soviet Union, he did not press for an immediate proclamation of a republic. Togliatti wanted the monarchy to continue as the best way of winning the Communists support after the war.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 326\u2013327. For the same reason, Count Sforza wanted a republic as soon as possible, arguing the House of Savoy was far too closely associated with Fascism to enjoy moral legitimacy, and the only hope of establishing a liberal democracy in Italy after the war was a republic. By this point, the government of The 1st Duke of Addis Abeba was so unpopular with the Italian people that Umberto was willing to accept the support of any party with a mass following, even the Communists. The fact that, contrary to expectations, Togliatti and The Duke of Addis Abeba got along very well, led to widespread fears amongst liberal-minded Italians that a Togliatti-Addis Abeba duumvirate might emerge, forming an alliance between what rapidly was becoming Italy's largest mass party and the military.Ellwood, David Italy 1943\u20131945, Leicester: Leicester University Press, 1985 p. 88. The power and influence of The Duke of Addis Abeba's government, based in Salerno, was very limited, but the entry of the Communists, followed by representatives of the other anti-Fascist parties, into the Cabinet of that government in April 1944 marked the moment when, as the British historian David Ellwood noted, \"...anti-Fascism had compromised with the traditional state and the defenders of Fascism, and this compromise had been engineered by the Communist Party. A quite new phase in Italy's liberation was opening\".Ellwood, David Italy 1943\u20131945, Leicester: Leicester University Press, 1985 p. 89. Besides the \"institutional question\", the principle responsibility of the Royal Italian Government was reconstruction of the liberated areas of Italy.Gerhard Weinberg, A World in Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004 p. 487 As the Allies pushed northwards, aside from the damage caused by the fighting, the retreating Germans systematically destroyed all of the infrastructure, leading to a humanitarian disaster in the liberated parts. Umberto, together with the rest of his father's government, spent time attempting to have humanitarian aid delivered.", "Under strong pressure from Robert Murphy and Harold Macmillan of the ACC at a meeting on 10 April 1944, Victor Emmanuel transferred most of his powers to Umberto.Holland, James Italy's Year of Sorrow, 1944\u20131945, New York: St. Martin's Press, 2008 p. 249. The King bitterly told Lieutenant-General Sir Noel Mason-MacFarlane that Umberto was unqualified to rule, and that handing power over to him was equivalent to letting the Communists come to power.Mack Smith, Denis Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989 p. 326 However, events had moved beyond Victor Emmanuel's ability to control. After Rome was liberated in June, Victor Emmanuel transferred his remaining constitutional powers to Umberto, naming his son Lieutenant General of the Realm. However, Victor Emmanuel retained the title and position of King. During his period as Regent, Umberto saw his father only three times, partly out of a bid to distance himself and partly because of tensions between father and son. Mack Smith wrote that Umberto was: \"More attractive and outgoing than his father, he was even more a soldier at heart, and completely inexperienced as a politician...In personality less astute and intelligent than his father...less obstinate, he was far more open, affable and ready to learn\".Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p.325 & 330.", "As Regent, Umberto initially made a poor impression on almost everyone as he surrounded himself with Fascist-era generals as his advisers, spoke of the military as the basis of his power, frequently threatened to sue for libel anyone who made even the slightest critical remarks about the House of Savoy, and asked the ACC to censor the press to prevent the criticism of himself or his father.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 325. The British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, wrote after meeting Umberto, in a message to London, that he was \"the poorest of poor creatures\", and his only qualification for the throne was that he had more charm than his charmless father. The historian and philosopher Benedetto Croce, a minister in The Duke of Addis Abeba's cabinet, called Umberto \"entirely insignificant\" as he found the Prince of Piedmont to be shallow, vain, superficial, and of low intelligence, and alluding to his homosexuality stated his private life was \"tainted by scandal\".", "After Togliatti and the Communists entered The Duke of Addis Abeba's cabinet, taking the oaths of loyalty to Umberto in the so-called Svolta di Salerno (\"Salerno turn\"), the leaders of the other anti-Fascist parties felt they had no choice but to join the cabinet as to continue to boycott it might lead Italy to being open to Communist domination. The other parties entered the cabinet on 22 April 1944 in order to preempt the Communists who joined the cabinet on 24 April.Giuseppe Mammarealla Italy After Fascism A Political History 1943\u20131965, Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1966 p. 68 The Christian Democratic leader Alcide De Gasperi believed in 1944 that a popular vote would ensure a republic immediately, and sources from the Vatican suggested to him that only 25% of Italians favoured continuing the monarchy.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 332. The Catholic Church was in favour of Umberto, who, unlike his father, was a sincere Catholic who it was believed would keep the Communists out of power. However, De Gasperi admitted that though the monarchy was a conservative institution, \"it was difficult to answer the argument that the monarchy had done little to serve the interests of the country or people during the past thirty years\".", "Umberto's own relations with the Allies were strained by his insistence that after the war Italy should keep all of its colonial empire, including Ethiopia and the parts of Yugoslavia that Mussolini had annexed in 1941.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 341. Both the British and Americans told Umberto that Ethiopia had its independence restored in 1941 and would not revert to Italian rule, while the Allies had promised that Yugoslavia would be restored to its pre-war frontiers after the war. Umberto later stated that he would have never signed the peace treaty of 1947 under which Italy renounced its empire. On 15 April 1944, in an interview with The Daily Express, Umberto stated his hope that Italy would become a full Allied power, expressing his wish that the Regia Marina would fight in the Pacific against the Japanese Empire and the Regio Esercito would march alongside the other Allied armies in invading Germany.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 328. In the same interview, Umberto stated that he wanted post-war Italy to have a government \"patterned on the British monarchy, and at the same time incorporating as much of America's political framework as possible\". Umberto admitted that, in retrospect, his father had made grave mistakes as King and criticised Victor Emmanuel for a suffocating childhood, where he was never permitted to express his personality or hold views of his own.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 331. In the same interview, Umberto stated that his hope was to make Italy a democracy by executing \"the vastest education programme Italy has ever seen\" to eliminate illiteracy in Italy once and for all.", "A few days later, on 19 April 1944, Umberto in an interview with The Times complained that the ACC was too liberal in giving Italians too much freedom, as the commissioners \"seemed to expect the Italian people to run before they could walk\". In the same interview, Umberto demanded the ACC censor the Italian press to end the criticism of the Royal Family, and claimed he had no choice but to support Mussolini because otherwise he would have been disinherited. Finally, Umberto made the controversial statement that Mussolini \"at first had the full support of the nation\" in bringing Italy into the war in June 1940, and Victor Emmanuel III had only signed the declarations of war because \"there was no sign that the nation wanted it otherwise. No single voice was raised in protest. No demand was made for summoning parliament\". The interview with The Times caused a storm of controversy in Italy, with many Italians objecting to Umberto's claim that the responsibility for Italy entering the war rested with ordinary Italians and his apparent ignorance of the difficulties of holding public protests under the Fascist regime in 1940.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 328\u2013329. Sforza wrote in his diary of his belief that Victor Emmanuel, \"that little monster\", had put Umberto up to the interview with the aim of discrediting his son.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 329. Croce wrote:\"The Prince of Piedmont for twenty-two years has never shown any sign of acting independently of his father. Now he is simply repeating his father's arguments. He chooses to do this at the very moment when, having been designated lieutenant of the kingdom, he ought to be overcoming doubt and distrust as I personally hoped he would succeed in doing. To me it seems unworthy to try to unload the blame and errors of royalty on the people. I, an old monarchist, am therefore specially grieved when I see the monarchs themselves working to discredit the monarchy\". Various Italian politicians had attempted to persuade the Allies to revise the armistice of 1943 in Italy's favour on the grounds that there was a difference between the Fascist regime and the Italian people. Umberto's statement that the House of Savoy bore no responsibility, when he asserted that the Italian people had been of one mind with Mussolini in June 1940, was widely seen as weakening the case for revising the armistice.Giuseppe Mammarealla Italy After Fascism A Political History 1943\u20131965, Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1966 p. 63", "Umberto, in September 1944, vetoed an attempt by the Bonomi government to start an investigation of who was responsible for abandoning Rome in September 1943 as he feared that it would show his father was a coward.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 334. The same month, The Duke of Addis Abeba, who was kept on as an adviser by Umberto, made an offer to the British and the Americans on behalf of the regent in September 1944 for Italy to be governed by a triumvirate consisting of himself, Bonomi and another former Prime Minister, Vittorio Orlando, which purged the prefects in the liberated areas who were \"agents of Togliatti and Nenni\" with Fascist-era civil servants. The Duke of Addis Abeba also spoke of Umberto's desire not to lose any territory after the war to Greece, Yugoslavia and France. Addis Abeba's offer was rejected as Admiral Ellery W. Stone of the ACC was opposed to Umberto's plans to have Bonomi share power with The Duke of Addis Abeba and Orlando, seeing this as upsetting the delicately achieved political consensus for no other reason than to increase the Crown's power.Ellwood, David Italy 1943\u20131945, Leicester: Leicester University Press, 1985 p. 105.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 338.", "In October 1944, Umberto, in an interview with The New York Times, stated that he favoured a referendum to decide whether Italy was to be a republic or a monarchy, instead of having the \"institutional question\" decided by the national assembly that would write Italy's post-war constitution.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 333\u2013334. Umberto's interview caused some controversy as it was widely feared by the republican parties that a referendum would be rigged, especially in the south of Italy.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 335. In the same interview, Umberto mentioned his belief that, after the war, monarchies all over the world would move towards the left, and stated that under his leadership Italy would go leftwards \"in an ordered, liberal way\" as he understood \"the weight of the past is the monarchy's greatest handicap\", which he would resolve by a \"radical revision\" of the Statuto Albertino.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 333. Umberto spoke favourably of Togliatti as he was \"clever, agreeable, and easy to discuss problems with\". In private, Umberto said he found Togliatti \"to be a very congenial companion whose intelligence he respected, but was afraid that he suited his conversation according to his company\".", "In the belated hope of influencing public opinion ahead of a referendum on the continuation of the monarchy, Victor Emmanuel formally abdicated in favour of Umberto on 9 May 1946 and left for Egypt. Before departing for Egypt, Victor Emmanuel saw Umberto for the last time, saying farewell in a cold, emotionless way. The Catholic Church saw the continuation of the monarchy as the best way of keeping the Italian left out of power, and during the referendum campaign Catholic priests used their pulpits to warn that \"all the pains of hell\" were reserved for those who voted for a republic.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 339. The Catholic Church presented the referendum not as a question of republic vs. monarchy, but instead as a question of Communism vs. Catholicism, warning to vote for a republic would be to vote for the Communists. On the day before the referendum, 1 June 1946, Pope Pius XII, in a sermon on St. Peter's Square, said in what was widely seen as endorsing Umberto: \"What is the problem? The problem is whether one or the other of those nations, of those two Latin sisters [elections were taking place in France on the same day] with several thousands of years of civilisation will continue to learn against the solid rock of Christianity,...or on the contrary do they want to hand over the fate of their future to the impossible omnipotence of a material state without extraterrestrial ideals, without religion, and without God. One of these two alternatives shall occur according to whether the names of the champions or the destroyers of Christian civilization emerge victorious from the urns\". Umberto believed that the support from the Catholic Church would be decisive and that he would win the referendum by a narrow margin.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 340. The De Gasperi cabinet accepted Umberto as King, but refused to accept the normal appellation for Italian kings \"by the Grace of God and the will of the people\".", "In northern Italy, which had been the scene of the guerrilla struggle against the Italian Social Republic and the Germans, much of the population had been radicalised by the struggle, and feelings were very much against the monarchy. Kogan wrote Victor Emmanuel's flight from Rome was \"bitterly remembered\" in the Nord as an act of cowardice and betrayal by the King who abandoned his people to the German occupation without a fight.Kogan, Norman A Political History of Postwar Italy, London: Pall Mall Press, 1966 p. 34 The socialist leader Sandro Pertini warned Umberto not to campaign in Milan as otherwise he would be lynched by the Milanese working class if he should appear in that city. Republican cartoonists mercilessly mocked Umberto's physical quirks, as the American historian Anthony Di Renzo wrote that he was: \"Tall, stiff, and balding, he had smooth, clean-shaven blue cheeks, thin lips, and a weak chin. Dressed in military uniform as First Marshal of the Empire, decorated with the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, he seemed more like a majordomo than a king. On the campaign trail, Umberto was received with much more friendliness in the south of Italy than in the north. People in the Mezzogiorno loved their King, who on the campaign trail in Sicily showed an encyclopedic knowledge of Sicilian villages which greatly endeared him to the Sicilians. Umberto's principal arguments for retaining the monarchy were it was the best way to revive Italy as a great power; it was the only institution capable of holding Italy together by checking regional separatism; and it would uphold Catholicism against anti-clericalism.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 338\u2013339. The republicans charged that Umberto had done nothing to oppose Fascism, with his major interest being his \"glittering social life\" in the high society of Rome and Turin, and that as a general knew that Italy was unready for war in 1940, but did not warn Mussolini against entering the war.Giuseppe Mammarealla Italy After Fascism A Political History 1943\u20131965, Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1966 p. 62", "Mack Smith wrote that \"some of the more extreme monarchists\" expressed doubts about the legitimacy of the referendum, claiming that millions of voters, many of them pro-monarchist, were unable to vote because they had not yet been able to return to their own local areas to register.Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press pp. 339\u2013341. Nor had the issue of Italy's borders been settled definitively, so the voting rights of those in disputed areas had not been satisfactorily clarified. Other allegations were made about voter manipulation, and even the issue of how to interpret the votes became controversial, as it appeared that not just a majority of those validly voting but of those votes cast (including spoiled votes), was needed to reach an outcome in the event the monarchy lost by a tight margin.", "The republic was formally proclaimed four days later, ending Umberto's brief 34-day reign as King. Umberto at first refused to accept what he called \"the outrageous illegality\" of the referendum, and took his deposition badly. In his last official statement as King, Umberto refused to accept the republic, saying he was the victim of a coup d'\u00e9tat by his ministers and the referendum had been rigged against him.Kogan, Norman A Political History of Postwar Italy, London: Pall Mall Press, 1966 p. 38 In response, De Gasperi, who became Acting President, replied in a press statement: \"We must strive to understand the tragedy of someone who, after inheriting a military defeat and a disastrous complicity with dictatorship, tried hard in recent months to work with patience and good will towards a better future. But this final act of the thousand-year old House of Savoy must be seen as part of our national catastrophe; it is an expiation, an expiation forced upon all of us, even those who have not shared directly in the guilt of the dynasty\". Some monarchists advocated using force to prevent a republic from being proclaimed, even at the risk of a civil war, but Mack Smith wrote that: \"Common sense and patriotism saved Umberto from accepting such counsel\".Denis Mack Smith, Italy and Its Monarchy, New Haven: Yale University Press p. 339 Umberto rejected the advice that he should go to Naples, proclaim a rival government with the intention of starting a civil war in which the Army would presumably side with the House of Savoy, under the grounds that \"My house united Italy. It will not divide it\". The monarchy of the House of Savoy formally ended on 12 June 1946, and Umberto left the country. Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi assumed office as Italy's interim Head of State. At about 3\u00a0pm on 13 June 1946, Umberto left the Quirinal Palace for the last time with the servants all assembled in the courtyard to see him off and many were in tears. At Ciampino Airport in Rome, as Umberto boarded the aeroplane that was to take him to Lisbon, a carabiniere grabbed him by the hand and said: \"Your Majesty, we will never forget you!\""]}, {"page": "Wolfson College, Oxford", "response": ["Notable current and former fellows of the college include: William Bradshaw, Baron Bradshaw, Member of the House of Lords; Anthony Epstein, discoverer of the Epstein-Barr virus; Steven Schwartz, Vice Chancellor of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia; Denis Mack Smith, historian at Oxford; Niko Tinbergen, Dutch ethologist and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; and Dorothy Hodgkin, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry."]}, {"page": "History of Montenegro", "response": ["The English historian Denis Mack Smith wrote that the Queen of Italy (considered the most influential Montenegrin woman in history) convinced her husband the King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III to impose on Mussolini the creation of an independent Montenegro, against the wishes of the fascist Croats and Albanians (who wanted to enlarge their countries with the Montenegrin territories).
