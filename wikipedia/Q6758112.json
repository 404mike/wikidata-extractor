Marcus Crouch, writing in 1975, thought that it derived from the Home Counties Circuit of courts that since at least the 18th century had surrounded London. Looking further back, he suggested that it included the counties in which, since Tudor times, it has been possible for civil servants and politicians to have their country homes and still be able to travel into London without excessive delay when they were needed. A distant Anglo-Saxon origin has also been speculated.", "Marcus Crouch, however, has made the point that the home counties have been more affected by migration from within and without the United Kingdom than any other region of the country, making them the most cosmopolitan region of England and meaning that there is no typical home counties inhabitant. One result of this diversity, he argues, is that local loyalties are shallower in the home counties than in, for instance, Yorkshire or parts of Scotland where there has been less population mobility.", "Marcus Crouch has identified one of the principal characteristics of the home counties as being a shared chalk geology that is broadly mirrored north and south of the Thames."]}, {"page": "Ironside (cavalry)", "response": ["The Ironsides are featured in Rosemary Sutcliff's 1953 historical fiction novel Simon, and are portrayed as being very professional soldiers with strong puritan religious tendencies.Marcus Crouch, Treasure Seekers and Borrowers: Children's books in Britain 1900-1960,  The Library Association, 1962, pp 125-126: \"suddenly, in Simon (1953), the author found her strength in a brilliant realistic picture of life in the civil wars.\" "]}, {"page": "Ruth Manning-Sanders", "response": ["Manning-Sanders died in 1988 in Penzance, England.

What makes the book a true novel, though, is Armstrong's exposition and analysis of character.
