However, the follow-up work of Johannes Holtfreter, Dorothy M. Needham and Joseph Needham, Conrad Waddington and others showed that organizers killed by boiling, fixing or freezing were also capable of causing induction. The conclusion was that the actual controllers were inert molecules, though little headway was made until the end of the 20th century in discovering how signalling took place."]}, {"page": "Transferase", "response": ["Transamination, or the transfer of an amine (or NH2) group from an amino acid to a keto acid by an aminotransferase (also known as a \"transaminase\"), was first noted in 1930 by Dorothy M. Needham, after observing the disappearance of glutamic acid added to pigeon breast muscle. This observance was later verified by the discovery of its reaction mechanism by Braunstein and Kritzmann in 1937.  Their analysis showed that this reversible reaction could be applied to other tissues.   This assertion was validated by Rudolf Schoenheimer's work with radioisotopes as tracers in 1937. This in turn would pave the way for the possibility that similar transfers were a primary means of producing most amino acids via amino transfer."]}, {"page": "Lu Gwei-djen", "response": ["In 1938, she came to the UK for a year's postgraduate study at the University of Cambridge under Dorothy M.
