His father was Arthur Hughes, a civil servant, and his mother Louisa Grace Warren who had been brought up in the West Indies in Jamaica.  He was educated first at Charterhouse School and graduated from Oriel College, Oxford in 1922.\nA Charterhouse schoolmaster had sent Hughes's first published work to the magazine The Spectator in 1917. The article, written as a school essay, was an unfavourable criticism of The Loom of Youth, by Alec Waugh, a recently published novel which caused a furore for its account of homosexual passions between British schoolboys in a public school. At Oxford he met Robert Graves, also an Old Carthusian, and they co-edited a poetry publication, Oxford Poetry, in 1921. Hughes's short play The Sisters' Tragedy was being staged in the West End of London at the Royal Court Theatre by 1922. He was the author of the world's first radio play, Danger, commissioned from him for the BBC by Nigel Playfair and broadcast on 15 January 1924.\nHughes was employed as a journalist and travelled widely before he married the painter Frances Bazley (1905-1985) in 1932. They settled for a period in Norfolk and then in 1934 at Castle House, Laugharne in South Wales. Dylan Thomas stayed with Hughes and wrote his book Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog whilst living at Castle House. Hughes was instrumental in Thomas relocating permanently to the area.He wrote only four novels, the most famous of which is The Innocent Voyage (1929), or A High Wind in Jamaica, as Hughes renamed it soon after its initial publication. Set in the 19th century, it explores the events which follow the accidental capture of a group of English children by pirates: the children are revealed as considerably more amoral than the pirates (it was in this novel that Hughes first described the cocktail Hangman's Blood). In 1938, he wrote an allegorical novel, In Hazard, based on the true story of the S.S. Phemius that was caught in the 1932 Cuba hurricane for four days during its maximum intensity. He wrote volumes of children's stories, including The Spider's Palace.\nDuring World War II, Hughes had a desk job in the Admiralty. He met the architects Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry, whose children stayed with the Hughes family for much of that time. After the end of the war, he spent ten years writing scripts for Ealing Studios, and published no more novels until 1961. Of the trilogy The Human Predicament, only the first two volumes, The Fox in the Attic (1961) and The Wooden Shepherdess (1973), were complete when he died; twelve chapters, less than 50 pages, of the final volume are now published. In these he describes the course of European history from the 1920s through World War II, including real characters and events\u2014such as Hitler's escape after the abortive Munich putsch\u2014as well as fictional.\nLater in life Hughes relocated to Ynys in Gwynedd.\nHe was churchwarden of Llanfihangel-y-traethau, the village church, where he was buried when he died at home in 1976.Hughes was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and, in the United States, an honorary member of both the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1946.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Richard Hughes (1900\u20131976, E/W)"]}, {"page": "Martin Amis", "response": ["In 1965, at the age of 15, Amis played John Thornton in the film version of Richard Hughes' A High Wind in Jamaica."]}, {"page": "Under Milk Wood", "response": ["In 1938, Thomas suggested that a group of Welsh writers should prepare a verse-report of their \"own particular town, village, or district.\"Letter to Meurig Walters, written in Blashford, Hampshire, 28 March 1938 in Collected Letters.

The author Richard Hughes, who lived in Laugharne, has recalled that Thomas spoke with him in 1939 about writing a play about Laugharne, in which the villagers would play themselves.

However, several clergymen, including the Archbishop of York, were angered by the book's lack of emphasis on Christianity, while other right-wing authors objected to a perceived sympathy with the Soviet Union.

Weiler of The New York Times wrote, \"Although hands involved are either experienced or willing, a good deal of the nuance, philosophy and insight into the human condition for which the book was lauded, appear to be missing on the screen. This is simply a voyage full of sound and fury but one without much conviction or meaning.\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called it \"an absorbing, unusual and fit-for-the-family film, though it will not satisfy those who treasure the Richard Hughes novel ... By shifting the focus onto the pirate-captain, the film all but buries the role the children play.\" Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"it is a good movie, an entertaining movie, but it lacks the dirk-sharp bite of the author's prose, and the antic madness that made it such an astonishing delight now cuts through only fitfully.\"Scheuer, Philip K. (23 May 1965) \"'Rolls' Purrs Smoothly\u2014'Wind' Blows Hot and Cold\". Los Angeles Times. Calendar, p. 17. Variety was generally positive, noting a \"warm screenplay\" and \"often spectacular treatment\" given to the color photography. A review in The Monthly Film Bulletin stated that although Hughes' novel had \"undergone a softening process,\" it was \"surprising how well the film manages to suggest the feeling that the children are living in a world of their own as they play happily throughout their ordeal ... Equally good is the atmosphere of superstitious terror among the native crew, fed by the children's innocent teasing.\""]}, {"page": "Lilly Library", "response": ["* Richard Hughes, author of A High Wind in Jamaica."]}, {"page": "Castle House, Laugharne", "response": ["Until recently Castle House was in the ownership of the Starke family, who had held it since the early 19th century, although it is now the private residence of David Thomas and Abi Thomas, daughter of the local artist David Petersen.
