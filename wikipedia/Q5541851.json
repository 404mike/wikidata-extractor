Harry Storer was replaced as manager by Dick Bayliss, who had been his assistant, and some pre-war players, such as George Mason and Harry Barratt and goalkeeper Alf Wood, remained with the club. Another returnee was George Lowrie, who had been signed in 1939 and would go on to become the club's leading centre-forward. City finished eighth in 1946\u201347 and established a reputation for being difficult to beat. They suffered a major setback when Bayliss, who was returning from a scouting mission to Scotland, became stranded in a snowstorm in Yorkshire. He became seriously ill and died in April 1947. He was replaced by Billy Frith, who guided the club to another mid-table finish in 1947\u201348. The following season started disastrously, with City losing ten of their opening sixteen games and Frith was dismissed in November 1948. Storer was persuaded to leave Birmingham and return to Coventry, and had an instant effect with the team winning the first five games of his second spell and going on to escape relegation. This feat, following his earlier success with the club, enhanced his popularity with the club's supporters."]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. international footballers", "response": ["|George Lowrie"]}, {"page": "Wales national football team results (1946\u20131959)", "response": ["|1947\u201348 British Home Championship|| Trevor Ford, George Lowrie|| 88,000", "|1947\u201348 British Home Championship|| George Lowrie, George Edwards || 32,310"]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| George Lowrie", "|align=left| George Lowrie"]}, {"page": "Lowrie, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Lowrie"]}]}}
