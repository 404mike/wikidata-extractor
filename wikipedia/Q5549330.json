Lawrence studied stagecraft with Frank Benson before founding his own Shakespearean company with William Haviland (1860-1917) - the Haviland and Lawrence Shakespearian & Dramatic Company - which during 1897 and 1898 toured South Africa where, among others, they performed Hamlet and Much Ado About Nothing. In the cast was Lawrence's wife Lilian Braithwaite, whom he had married shortly before the tour.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ralph Richardson", "response": ["Richardson left the run of Yellow Sands in March 1928 and rejoined Ayliff, playing Pygmalion in Back to Methuselah at the Royal Court Theatre; also in the cast was a former colleague from the Birmingham Repertory, Laurence Olivier.Clough, p. 52 The critics began to notice Richardson and he gained some favourable reviews. As Tranio in Ayliff's modern-dress production of The Taming of the Shrew, Richardson played the character as a breezy cockney, winning praise for turning a usually dreary role into something richly entertaining. For the rest of 1928 he appeared in what Miller describes as several unremarkable modern plays. For much of 1929 he toured South Africa in Gerald Lawrence's company in three period costume plays, including The School for Scandal, in which he played Joseph Surface. The sole venture into musical comedy of his career was in Silver Wings in the West End and on tour. It was not a personal triumph; the director's final injunction to the company was, \"For God's sake don't let Richardson sing\". In May 1930 Richardson was given the role of Roderigo in Othello in what seemed likely to be a prestigious production, with Paul Robeson in the title role. The biographer Ronald Hayman writes that though a fine singer, \"Robeson had no ear for blank verse\" and even Peggy Ashcroft's superb performance as Desdemona was not enough to save the production from failure.Gielgud (2000), p. 157; and Hayman, p. 63 Ashcroft's notices were laudatory, while Richardson's were mixed; they admired each other and worked together frequently during the next four decades.Miller, p. 34"]}, {"page": "Twelfth Night", "response": ["An adaptation of Twelfth Night by Cathleen Nesbitt for the BBC was the first complete Shakespeare play ever broadcast on British radio.
