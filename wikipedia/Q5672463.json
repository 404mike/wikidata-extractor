He first played for Gloucestershire in 1912 and took over as regular wicket-keeper from Jack Board in 1914. From then until 1931, he was a regular in the side, often batting at No 3 in a team perennially reliant for its runs on just a few players.\nHe played just one Test match, the first match ever against the West Indies at Lord's in 1928. He scored seven runs and took one catch, but made way in the next match for Harry Elliott, who in turn made way for George Duckworth for the third and final Test.\nSmith missed the whole of the 1932 season through illness, prompting Wisden in 1933 to an unusual tribute in its usually emotion-free pages: \"Smith's absence,\" it wrote, \"meant something more than the loss of a thoroughly dependable wicket-keeper and a batsman capable of getting runs when runs were most needed, because, perhaps unconsciously, his fellow professionals had come to regard him as their father, and, in an unassuming way, he was a source of strength to his captain on the field. His value was equally marked in the dressing room and on the long journeys which continually had to be faced.\"[2]Smith did not appear in first-class cricket in 1933 or 1934, but in 1935, Gloucestershire having failed to find an adequate successor as wicket-keeper, he returned for 15 county matches, though he was ill and his batting was negligible. He died little over two years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Smith", "response": ["Harry Smith is the name of:", "* Harry Smith (infielder) (1856\u20131898), American baseball player", "* Harry Smith (pitcher) (1889\u20131964), American baseball player", "* Harry Smith (1900s catcher) (1874\u20131933), British-born baseball player & manager", "* Harry Smith (1910s catcher) (1890\u20131922), American baseball player", "* Harry Smith (Australian cricketer) (1887\u20131916), Australian cricketer, played first-class cricket for Tasmania and Victoria", "* Harry Smith (cricketer, born 1884) (1884\u20131935), South African cricketer", "* Harry Smith (cricketer, born 1886) (1886\u20131955), English cricketer, for Derbyshire and Warwickshire", "* Harry Smith (cricketer, born 1890) (1890\u2013?), English cricketer, played first-class cricket for Essex", "* Harry Smith (cricketer, born 1891) (1891\u20131937), English Test cricketer", "* Harry Smith (American football) (1918\u20132013), American football player", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u2013?), footballer for Stoke and Walsall", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u20131960), Australian rules footballer for Fitzroy and Geelong", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1894), English footballer for Northampton Town", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1901), English footballer for Clapton Orient", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1904) (1900\u2013?), English footballer for West Ham United", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1908) (1908\u20131993), English footballer for Nottingham Forest, Darlington and Bristol Rovers", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1916) (1916\u20131983), Australian rules footballer for Richmond", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1930), English footballer for Chester in 1950s", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1932), English footballer for Torquay United and Bristol City", "* Harry Smith (footballer, born 1995), English footballer for Leyton Orient F.C.", "* Harry Smith (soccer) (1907\u20131983), American soccer full back", "* Harry Smith (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer", "* Harry Smith (coach), Tampa Bay Buccaneers strength coach (1976\u20131979)", "* Harry Smith (ice hockey) (1935\u20132020), Canadian ice hockey player", "* Harry Smith (ice hockey, born 1883) (1883\u20131953), Canadian ice hockey player", "* Harry Smith (rugby league) (born 2000), rugby league footballer", "* Harry Smith (runner) (1888\u20131962), American marathoner and great-grandfather of pro wrestler Harry Smith", "* Harry Smith, known as Davey Boy Smith Jr. (born 1985), Canadian professional wrestler and great-grandson of American marathoner Harry Smith", "* Harry Smith (poet) (1936\u20132012), American poet and editor", "* Harry Smith (American journalist) (born 1951), US broadcast journalist", "* Harry Smith (British journalist) (1951\u20132020), British broadcast journalist", "* Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet (1787\u20131860), British soldier", "* Harry Smith (Australian soldier) (born 1933), senior officer of the Australian Army", "* Harry Smith (MP) (1829\u20131910), British politician in Falkirk Burghs", "* Harry Smith (Alberta politician) (1873\u20131928), Canadian politician", "* Harry Smith (microbiologist) (1921\u20132011), British microbiologist", "* Harry Smith (Egyptologist) (born 1928), British Egyptologist and academic", "* Harry Smith (botanist) (1935\u20132015), British botanist"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Harry Smith \u00b7"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Harry Smith (1912\u20131935) : H.
