Nation wrote the scripts between writing episodes of The Saint (1962\u20131969).

His first script, The Myth Makers, a tongue-in-cheek historical based like several of his radio plays on Greek mythology, pushed comedic elements to the limit. Cotton's planned episode titles were altered due to BBC disapproval of the punning theme the author had devised for them.
