Originally an actor in non-musical plays, he was persuaded to try opera and made an immediate success. He played a range of buffo parts in operas, at Glyndebourne and internationally.  Wallace maintained a simultaneous career in revue, straight theatre, and broadcasting. He appeared in pantomime and at the Royal Variety Performance. As a broadcaster, he was a long-time panellist on the BBC radio panel game My Music, and he presented a television series of introductions to operas in the 1960s, as well as appearing in light entertainment shows singing a range of songs from ballads to comedy numbers.  He performed his one-man show for many years.  Flanders and Swann wrote several songs for him, and their best-known novelty song, \"The Hippopotamus\", became indelibly associated with him.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Toad of Toad Hall", "response": ["In the 1960s and 1970s there were annual West End revivals during the Christmas season, with Goolden returning to the part of Mole in every year except one.Herbert, pp. 482\u2013483 Among the actors appearing in the play in London and elsewhere were, in the title role Michael Bates,Herbert, p. 391 Hywel Bennett,Herbert, p. 403 Derek Godfrey,Herbert, p. 658 Nicky Henson,Herbert, p. 723 Michael Hordern,Herbert, p. 745 Paul Scofield,Trewin, p. 8 Ian Wallace,\"Theatres\", The Times, 23 December 1964, p. 11 Michael Williams,Herbert, p. 1257 Peter WoodthorpeHerbert, p. 1269 and Patrick Wymark.\"Toad of Toad Hall\", Royal Shakespeare Company.
