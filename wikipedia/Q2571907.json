Originally an actor in non-musical plays, he was persuaded to try opera and made an immediate success. He played a range of buffo parts in operas, at Glyndebourne and internationally.  Wallace maintained a simultaneous career in revue, straight theatre, and broadcasting. He appeared in pantomime and at the Royal Variety Performance. As a broadcaster, he was a long-time panellist on the BBC radio panel game My Music, and he presented a television series of introductions to operas in the 1960s, as well as appearing in light entertainment shows singing a range of songs from ballads to comedy numbers.  He performed his one-man show for many years.  Flanders and Swann wrote several songs for him, and their best-known novelty song, \"The Hippopotamus\", became indelibly associated with him.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
