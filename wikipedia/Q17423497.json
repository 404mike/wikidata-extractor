He was born at Lavenham, Suffolk and died at Cambridge.\nJohnson was the eldest son of the rector of Lavenham, also named Richard Johnson, and his wife, the former Mary Ann Cubitt. He was educated at Bury St Edmunds Grammar School and at Clare College, Cambridge. He was followed to Cambridge and into the cricket team there by his younger brother, George Randall Johnson \u2013 whose son, Peter Randall Johnson, took the same path 50 years later and was then a famous Somerset cricketer.\nJohnson played cricket for Cambridge University in two matches, one each at home and away, against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1850, batting as a middle-order batsman. It is not recorded whether he batted right-handed or left-handed and the scorecards for both matches are incomplete, and so it is not recorded that he bowled, but if he did, he took no wickets. His top score of 28 came in the match at Lord's.Johnson died suddenly at Cambridge from typhoid fever while still an undergraduate; his close friend Edmund Keble White, who had been at school with him and was at Trinity College, Cambridge \u2013 their fathers had been fellows at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge \u2013 also died in the same typhoid outbreak.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Johnson", "response": ["Richard Johnson or Dick Johnson may refer to:", "* Richard Johnson, former director of the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies", "* Richard Johnson (war artist) (born 1966), Canadian journalist and war artist", "*Richard Johnson (actor) (1927\u20132015), English actor", "*Richard Johnson (columnist), American gossip columnist", "*Richard Johnson (director) (born 1974), American film director who founded Joystick Films in 2005", "* Richard Johnson (16th century) (1573\u2013c. 1659), romance writer", "* Richard Johnson (pianist) (born 1975), American composer, jazz pianist, and music professor", "* Richard Johnson, test-pilot of the X-4 Bantam", "* Richard Johnson (mayor), American politician and city manager", "* Richard Johnson (judge) (born 1937), president of the High Court of Ireland", "* Richard Johnson (cricketer, born 1829) (1829\u20131851), English cricketer", "* Richard Johnson (cricketer, born 1974), English cricketer", "* Richard Johnson (cricketer, born 1979), former English cricketer", "* Richard Johnson (cricketer, born 1988), cricketer for Warwickshire County Cricket Club", "* Richard Johnson (golfer) (born 1972), Welsh professional golfer", "* Richard Johnson (rugby) (born 1985), rugby league player for Bradford Bulls", "* Richard Johnson (soccer) (born 1974), Australian footballer", "* Richard Johnson (defensive back) (born 1963), former NFL cornerback", "* Richard Johnson (wide receiver) (born 1961), former NFL wide receiver", "* Richard Johnson (jockey) (born 1977), British jockey", "* Richard Johnson (chaplain) (c. 1753\u20131827), chaplain to first settlement in New South Wales", "* Richard Johnson (engineer) (1827\u20131924), British engineer, chief engineer to the Great Northern Railway", "* Richard Johnson (architect) (born 1946), Australian architect", "* Richard Johnson (entrepreneur), founder of hotjobs.com"]}, {"page": "George Randall Johnson", "response": ["Johnson was the second son of the Reverend Richard Johnson, rector of Lavenham, Suffolk.
