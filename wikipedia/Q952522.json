His only international goal came in a 5\u20131 win against Belgium in November 1949.

Paul took the kick, but it was saved by Norman Uprichard. Paul's failure cost Wales victory, as Jimmy Jones equalised in the second half and the match finished 1\u20131.A Red Dragon of Wales, pp. 73\u201374. A draw in the remaining fixture between Scotland and England meant that the miss also denied Wales victory in the tournament. Instead, for the first and only time there was a four-way tie.
