Known for her blue-eyed soul vocals, she was the first female singer from the UK to sign with Motown's Tamla Records.Dee is best known for her 1973 hit \"Amoureuse\", her 1974 hit \"I've Got the Music in Me\" and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", her 1976 duet with Elton John, which went to number 1 on both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Her 1981 single \"Star\" became the theme song for the talent show Opportunity Knocks when it was revived by the BBC in 1987. In 1993, she performed another duet with John for his Duets album, a cover version of Cole Porter's \"True Love\", which reached number 2 in the UK. During her career, she has released 40 singles, three EPs and 12 albums.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Disco", "response": ["Several of Motown's solo artists who left the label went on to have successful disco songs. Mary Wells, Motown's first female superstar with her signature song \"My Guy\" (written by Smokey Robinson), abruptly left the label in 1964. She briefly reappeared on the charts with the disco song \"Gigolo\" in 1980. Jimmy Ruffin, the elder brother of the Temptations lead singer David Ruffin, was also signed to Motown, and released his most successful and well-known song \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" as a single in 1966. Ruffin eventually left the record label in the mid-1970s, but saw success with the 1980 disco song \"Hold On (To My Love)\", which was written and produced by Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, for his album Sunrise. Edwin Starr, known for his Motown protest song \"War\" (1970), reentered the charts in 1979 with a pair of disco songs, \"Contact\" and \"H.A.P.P.Y. Radio\". Kiki Dee became the first white British singer to sign with Motown in the US, and released one album, Great Expectations (1970), and two singles \"The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday\" (1970) and \"Love Makes the World Go Round\" (1971), the latter giving her first-ever chart entry (number 87 on the US Chart). She soon left the company and signed with Elton John's The Rocket Record Company, and in 1976 had her biggest and best-known single, \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", a disco duet with John. The song was intended as an affectionate disco-style pastiche of the Motown sound, in particular the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye with Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston."]}, {"page": "March 6", "response": ["*1947 \u2013 Kiki Dee, English singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "1947", "response": ["** Kiki Dee, English pop singer (Don't Go Breaking My Heart)"]}, {"page": "Live Aid", "response": ["| 20:50 || Elton John || \"I'm Still Standing\"\"Bennie and the Jets\"\"Rocket Man\"\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" (with Kiki Dee)\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" (with Wham!)\"Can I Get a Witness\""]}, {"page": "Dusty Springfield", "response": ["In 1966 Springfield scored with three other UK hits, all varying in style: the snappy \"Little By Little\" (no. 17), a cover of Gerry Goffin and Carole King's poignant and reflective \"Goin' Back\" (no. 10), and the sweeping dramatic ballad \"All I See Is You\" (no. 9), co-written by Ben Weisman and Clive Westlake.

Archived from the original on 2007-11-22. Retrieved 2007-11-14: \"Lonnie Mack wailed a soul ballad as gutsily as any black gospel singer. The anguished inflections which stamped his best songs (\"Why?\", \"She Don't Come Here Anymore\" and \"Where There's a Will\") had a directness which would have been wholly embarrassing in the hands of almost any other white vocalist.\" Groups such as The Rascals had soul-tinged pop songs,  but it was the soulful vocals of Felix Cavaliere that gave them the blue-eyed soul sound. By the mid-1960s, British singers Dusty Springfield, Eric Burdon, and Tom Jones had become leading vocal stars of the emerging style. Other notable UK exponents of blue-eyed soul included The Spencer Davis Group (featuring Steve Winwood), Van Morrison, and archetypal mod band The Small Faces, whose sound was heavily influenced by the Stax label's house band Booker T. & the M.G.'s.

Some British rock groups of the 1960s\u2014such as the Spencer Davis Group, the Animals, the Rolling Stones (\"My Girl\"), and the Who (\"Heat Wave\")\u2014covered Motown and rhythm and blues tracks. In 1967, Jerry Lee Lewis, whose latter days at Sun Records (1961\u201363) had been characterized by R&B covers, recorded an album for Smash entitled Soul My Way. Delaney and Bonnie (Bramlett) produced the blue-eyed soul album Home on Stax in 1969. Michael Sembello, who left home at age 17 to tour with Stevie Wonder, wrote and performed on numerous blue-eyed soul hits for Wonder, Brian McKnight, David Sanborn, Bill Champlin, and Bobby Caldwell.
