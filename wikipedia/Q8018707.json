Lunn died in 1915 at the age of about 75 and Billington was asked to take over his class with John Adams (who later ran the Poole Pottery). She taught pottery at the Central School of Arts and Crafts from 1919 and left the RCA in 1925 when William Rothenstein appointed William Staite Murray as pottery instructor. The circumstances of her leaving remain somewhat unclear. By that date Rothenstein had been in place for five years, and although he supported Billington's work he criticised the teaching of pottery and other crafts as \"too unexperimental and derivative. No consistent attempt appears to have been made to deal with the interpretation of the contemporary world in design and execution... the research work towards the discovery of new subject matter and new treatment, so noticeable on the Continent, seem to have been wanting.\"Colman, including Rothenstein quote"]}, {"page": "Anglo-Japanese style", "response": ["With the advent of the further academic understanding of Japanese aesthetics, the Anglo-Japanese style ended, morphing into Modernism with the death of the 'Japan Craze' and Japanese art objects having become permanent parts of European and American Museum collections.

It is represented by potters all over the world but has strong roots in Britain, with potters such as Bernard Leach, William Staite Murray, Dora Billington, Lucie Rie and Hans Coper. Bernard Leach (1887\u20131979) established a style of pottery influenced by Far-Eastern and medieval English forms. After briefly experimenting with earthenware, he turned to stoneware fired to high temperatures in large oil- or wood-burning kilns.  This style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th-century.  The Austrian refugee Lucie Rie (1902\u20131995) has been regarded as essentially a modernist who experimented with new glaze effects on often brightly coloured bowls and bottles. Hans Coper (1920\u20131981) produced non-functional, sculptural and unglazed pieces.  After the Second World War, studio pottery in Britain was encouraged by the wartime ban on decorating manufactured pottery and the modernist spirit of the Festival of Britain.  The simple, functional designs chimed in with the modernist ethos.  Several potteries were formed in response to this fifties boom, and this style of studio pottery remained popular into the nineteen-seventies.Harrod, Tanya, \"From A Potter's Book to The Maker's Eye: British Studio Ceramics 1940\u20131982\", in The Harrow Connection, Northern Centre for Contemporary Art, 1989 Elizabeth Fritsch (1940-) took up ceramics working under Hans Coper at the Royal College of Art (1968\u20131971). Fritsch was one of a group of outstanding ceramicists who emerged from the Royal College of Art at that time. Fritschs' ceramic vessels broke away from traditional methods and she developed a hand built flattened coil technique in stoneware smoothed and refined into accurately profiled forms. They are then hand painted with dry matt slips, in colours unusual for ceramics."]}, {"page": "Denise Wren", "response": ["During the early 20th-century, British pottery production was a large scale industry and pottery was not taught in art schools. This began to change in 1920 when Bernard Leach established the Leach Pottery at St. Ives in Cornwall and in 1925 William Staite Murray became pottery tutor at the Royal College of Art. In contrast to Leach and his followers, who mainly made wheel-thrown pots, Wren used a wide variety of techniques such as building with slabs or coils of clay and making tiles and figurines in moulds: partly inspired by her lessons from Archibald Knox. Denise Wren's early pots were often incised with Celtic designs inspired by Archibald Knox. Wren also used commercially produced glazes, though often in an experimental way. Ceramicists like Denise Wren were part of a new aesthetic movement that began to emerge after the First World War. 'British Studio Potters' -men and women working alone or in small workshops designing and making pots and figurines. Wren's technical understanding of ceramic work was demonstrated at a meeting of the Craft Potters Association in 1960 where she produced a detailed scheme of categories against which a pot's quality could be judged. Each category was in turn, comprehensive: one contained 87 questions. Michael Casson referred to it as 'a brilliant piece of planning'."]}, {"page": "Bernard Rackham", "response": ["Bernard Rackham matriculated in October 1895 at Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating there B.A. 1898 and M.A. 1907.
