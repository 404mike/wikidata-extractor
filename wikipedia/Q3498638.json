While many of his professors were well established and knowledgeable, Xia criticized Walter Perceval Yetts, one of his professors in archeology for his incompetence in both Chinese and archaeology, and challenged his ironic role in heading the department of Chinese Art and Archaeology at London University. He pointed out how Yetts could not read Chinese when a student raised a question during a lecture and how he struggled to comprehend dynastic jargon when analyzing the authenticity of an original record by the Qing imperial court kept in the British Museum.Xia, Diary of Xia Nai, Volume 2, pp.120-1. Xia accumulated a handful of field experience in archaeology by participating in Wheeler's excavation at Maiden Castle in Dorset in July 1936 and returned to London in September later that year.Xia, Diary of Xia Nai, Volume 2, pp.78-96.

The archaeological and Egyptological communities in England rallied to obtain monetary support for her work: Sir John L. Myres arranged a grant for her to compile a bibliography of prehistoric Italy and Malta, and she also taught evening classes on the Egyptian language for University College London (UCL). This however did not occupy much of her time, so in 1936 she approached Stephen Glanville, the head of UCL's Egyptology department, for permission to work with the department's collections (what would become the Petrie Museum). The department had recently obtained the substantial personal collection of Glanville's predecessor, Sir Flinders Petrie, which was uncatalogued and poorly labelled.
