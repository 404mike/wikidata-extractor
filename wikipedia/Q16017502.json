The last pitched battle between Scotland and England before the Union of the Crowns, it was part of the conflict known as the Rough Wooing and is considered to have been the first modern battle in the British Isles. It was a catastrophic defeat for Scotland, where it became known as \"Black Saturday\".Phillips, p. 193 A highly detailed and illustrated English account of the battle and campaign authored by an eyewitness William Patten was published in London as propaganda four months after the battle.Marcus Merriman, The Rough Wooings: Mary Queen of Scots, 1542\u20131551 (Tuckwell: East Linton, 2000), pp. 7\u20138.", "Although the Scots blamed traitors for the defeat, it may be fairer to say that a Renaissance army defeated a medieval army. Henry VIII had taken steps towards creating standing naval and land forces which formed the nucleus of the fleet and army that gave Somerset the victory. However, the military historian Gervase Phillips has defended Scottish tactics, pointing out that Arran moved from his position by the Esk as a rational response to English manoeuvres by sea and land. In his 1877 account of the battle, Major Sadleir Stoney commented that \"every amateur knows that changing front in presence of an enemy is a perilous operation\".F. Sadlier Stoney, Life and Times of Ralph Sadleir (Longman: London, 1877), p. 109.

In 1548, the Scottish Master of Artillery, Lord Methven, gave his opinion that the battle was lost due to growing support in Scotland for English policy, and the mis-order and great haste of the Scottish army on the day.Annie I.
