This created antagonism between Mandelson and Brown, though they were considered allies in the Labour Party. In 1994 Kate Garvey suggested that Mandelson (who was at the time being derided by the trade unions and other Labour factions), should adopt a \"nom de guerre\" throughout Blair's leadership bid, so that he might conceal his considerable role within the campaign team. Mandelson agreed to be called \"Bobby\" for the duration and was thanked by Blair using this name in his victory speech."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Wales", "response": ["Wales married Kate Garvey at Wesley's Chapel in London on October 6, 2012.

Unlike some of his predecessors, Campbell was a political appointee and had not come up through the Civil Service. Despite his overtly political role, he was paid from public funds as a civil servant. Also in Blair's team were a number of strong female aides, who acted as gatekeepers and go-betweens, including Anji Hunter, Kate Garvey, Ruth Turner and Sally Morgan."]}, {"page": "Philip Gould, Baron Gould of Brookwood", "response": ["In 2007, he assumed a non-executive director role at Freud Communications,Philip Gould takes Freuds position, PR Week, 17 January 2007, by Hannah Marriott. the firm of Blair's former diary secretary, Kate Garvey."]}, {"page": "MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist/Archives/2013/09", "response": ["====Kate Garvey speaker bio at personal assistant conference====", "Where:  Kate Garvey"]}]}}
