Although primarily remembered as a batsman, he began his career as a fast-medium bowler. With George Lohmann, Tom Richardson and William Lockwood carrying all before them, Brockwell had few opportunities until they declined. However, from 1897 onwards, he was a very useful bowler and took 105 wickets in the 1899 season when Richardson was out of form and Lockwood never fully fit. Even in 1902, he took six for 37 on an excellent pitch in the last match of the season against Warwickshire.\nBorn in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, Brockwell played his county cricket for the very strong Surrey side of the last years of the 19th century. He made his first-class debut against Derbyshire in 1886. He played only occasionally up to 1890, but established himself in 1891 and 1892, when Surrey were at the height of their powers as a county side. However, it was not until 1893 that Brockwell became a vital member of the Surrey eleven, when he took 51 wickets at the same cost as the incomparable Richardson and, despite often going in late, proving to be one of the most consistent batsmen. In the very wet 1894 season, Brockwell, despite the consistently treacherous pitches, made a remarkable advance. He scored more runs (1,491) than any other player, and hit five centuries, and consequently was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He declined a great deal in 1895, but from the following year up to 1899, formed a formidable batting trio with Bobby Abel and Tom Hayward that made Surrey invincible on the perfect Oval pitches.\nBrockwell played seven Test matches for England, all against Australia \u2013 one in 1893, five on the 1894/95 tour and a final match in 1899 \u2013 but was not a success at this level and averaged under 17 with a highest score of just 49. He played on for Surrey until 1903, but from 1900 his powers as a batsman declined severely and after two final first-class matches for London County he retired from cricket.\nBrockwell spent the last fifteen years of his life homeless and he died in poverty at Richmond, Surrey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1894 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Bill Brockwell 1491 @ 38.23 (HS 128)", "* Wisden Five Young Batsmen of the Season \u2013 Bill Brockwell, Jack Brown, C B Fry, Tom Hayward, Archie MacLaren"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Bill Brockwell"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Bill Brockwell"]}, {"page": "1894 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden (Five Young Batsmen of the Season) \u2013 Bill Brockwell, Jack Brown, C B Fry, Tom Hayward, Archie MacLaren ", "|Bill Brockwell || Surrey || 16 || 754 || 34.27 || 3 || 3", "|Bill Brockwell || Players, South of England, Surrey || 32 || 1491 || 38.23 || 5 || 6"]}, {"page": "1898 English cricket season", "response": [" | Bill Brockwell || Surrey || 24 || 1468 || 43.17 || 5 || 5", " | Bill Brockwell || Players, Surrey || 30 || 1686 || 38.31 || 6 || 5"]}, {"page": "Walter Lees (cricketer)", "response": ["The following few years, however, were very patchy and Lees struggled to maintain his place in the side against competition from the rejuvenated Lockwood and Bill Brockwell.

He took part in the early development of the great gold mining industries, but without any very great measure of financial success. Throughout the stirring days of Barberton's beginnings, and the initial mining in the district of Witwatersrand, he remained steadily at work in Pretoria, although none of his local ventures proved really successful. Bourke was a well known patron of sports and athletics. His interest in Pretoria cricket was very keen, and he arranged for visits from the famous cricketers like Bill Brockwell, Albert Trott, and Len Braund. In his early days Bourke was captain of the Maritzburg Rugby team, and took a hearty interest in the game throughout his life.
