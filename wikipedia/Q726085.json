He was also known as Wor Jackie (particularly in North East England, a Geordie dialectal.\nCousin to the mother of Jack and Bobby Charlton, Milburn played two trial matches at St James' Park as a 19-year-old in 1943. In the second of these, he scored six second half goals. Milburn made his competitive debut in the FA Cup in the 1945\u201346 season and was initially deployed on the left wing as a supplier to Charlie Wayman. However, Wayman was dropped before a 4\u20130 defeat to eventual winners Charlton Athletic in a 1947 FA Cup semi-final and when he afterwards vowed not to play for United again, manager George Martin made the decision to switch Milburn to centre forward. In his next match, on 18 October 1947, Milburn wore the number nine shirt for the first time and scored a hat-trick.Milburn's subsequent achievements, particularly his two goals which won the 1951 FA Cup Final and his 45-second opener in the 1955 FA Cup Final which was the fastest ever Wembley FA Cup Final goal until it was beaten by Roberto Di Matteo in 1997, brought him national recognition and afforded him iconic status on Tyneside. In total, Milburn played in three FA Cup winning finals for United; 1951, 1952 and 1955. Despite his achievements, Milburn was reportedly a very shy and self-deprecating individual, whose modesty further endeared him to Newcastle United supporters, though according to Tom Finney, this stemmed from an \"innate inferiority complex\".By the time Milburn left Newcastle in 1957, he had become the highest goalscorer in Newcastle United's history. He remained so until he was surpassed by Alan Shearer in February 2006. Milburn remains Newcastle's second highest goalscorer, having scored 200 competitive goals. Milburn's transfer to Linfield in 1957 was almost jeopardised when the Newcastle board demanded a substantial signing fee, and much to the anger of fans, Milburn was not immediately granted a testimonial. His signing for Linfield \"added thousands to the gate\" and he made 54 appearances, scoring 68 goals in four seasons in all competitions for the club. He was finally granted a testimonial ten years later, in 1967.\nMilburn died of lung cancer on 9 October 1988, aged 64. His funeral took place on 13 October, and was attended by over 1,000 mourners at St Nicholas's Cathedral in Newcastle. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to watch the cort\u00e8ge pass. A statue of Milburn, costing \u00a335,000 and paid for by donations received from Newcastle United supporters was erected on Newcastle's Northumberland Street before it was relocated in 1999 to St James' Boulevard and then moved again to its present position on Strawberry Place, just outside St James' Park.\nMilburn was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in October 2006. In 2009, Goal.com listed Milburn as 43rd in their list of the top English players of all time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bobby Charlton", "response": ["Charlton was born in Ashington, Northumberland, England on 11 October 1937 to coal miner Robert \"Bob\" Charlton (24 May 1909 \u2013 April 1982)England & Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1916-20071939 England and Wales Register and Elizabeth Ellen \"Cissie\" Charlton (n\u00e9e Milburn) (11 November 1912 \u2013 25 March 1996).

They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the 1947\u201348 season. During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup three times in five years, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952 and Manchester City in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960\u201361 season under the management of Charlie Mitten. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964\u201365 season after winning the Second Division title. Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967\u201368 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6\u20132 over two legs against Hungary's \u00dajpest in the final."]}, {"page": "Alan Shearer", "response": ["The middle of 2005 saw Shearer reverse his decision to retire, after persuasion from manager Graeme Souness.

On 17 April 2006, with three games remaining in his final season as a player, Shearer suffered a tear to the medial collateral ligament in his left knee after a collision during a 4\u20131 win at Sunderland in which he scored his 206th and final goal in what was his 395th appearance for the club.

Arthur Cox had left the club after leading the \"Magpies\" to the First Division and key player Kevin Keegan announced his retirement. His first action was to release Terry McDermott from his contract, who refused to agree to Charlton's offer of a new contract. He had little money to spend in preparation for the 1984\u201385 season, though he did have young talents in Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley.

Keegan played football at Hyde Park using his baby brother Michael's pushchair as a goal post. As a boy he supported Doncaster Rovers. His favourite player was Alick Jeffrey, a player, once described by Matt Busby's assistant Jimmy Murphy as the English Pel\u00e9, and once described by Jackie Milburn as \"the best young player he had ever seen\". As a schoolboy, Keegan had a trial for Coventry City, under manager Jimmy Hill. Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract, though they did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back Brian Joy who also went on to have a 15-year career in football.

He was named as the PFA Young Player of the Year and listed on the PFA Team of the Year in the 1987\u201388 season. However his period at Newcastle coincided with a period of unrest and instability at the club, which left the club unable to hold on to such a talented young player. Gascoigne promised Alex Ferguson that he would sign for Manchester United. Ferguson duly went on holiday to Malta, expecting to sign Gascoigne. On his holiday, he received the news that Gascoigne had signed for Tottenham Hotspur, for a record British fee of \u00a32.2\u00a0million. In his 1999 autobiography, Ferguson claimed that Gascoigne was wooed into signing for Spurs after they bought a house for his impoverished family.Ferguson, Alex (1999) Managing My Life.
