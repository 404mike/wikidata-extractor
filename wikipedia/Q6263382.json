He was described as having 'catarrhal inflammation', and rest may improve it. However, he did not improve and was considerably weak, thin and pale with little exercise tolerance due to intermittent claudication. A series of X-rays were reviewed which, reported by Peter Kerley, a Westminster Hospital radiologist, suggested a tumour, and after Sir Horace Evans consulted Price Thomas, a bronchoscopy was organised. The bronchoscopy and biopsy were performed on 16 September, transported to the Brompton hospital by Price Thomas' son, Brian, and the result did confirm lung cancer. The diagnosis was kept secret from the king, who was sent for surgery to remove a blockage. It was also not customary for the public to need to know too much detail. By 11\u00a0am on Sunday 23 September 1951, the operation on the king's lung was being performed by Price Thomas and his assistants Charles Edwin Drew and Peter Jones in the Buhl room of the palace. Even the changing the King's guard was switched to St James's palace to avoid disturbance outside the operating theatre, where it would have otherwise taken place. Attempting to perform the surgery in their routine manner whereby the assistants sewed up the wound following removal of the tumour, Price Thomas is recalled to have remarked \"I haven't stitched up a chest for 25 years and I'm not going to start practising today!\" Following surgery, the king was moved back into his own bedroom, Drew and Jones staying overnight to supervise his early recovery. Distracted on his way home from the palace on the day of the operation, Price Thomas collided with another car, an accident the police refused to prosecute him for."]}, {"page": "Medical Service Ministries", "response": ["John Weir was a notable treasurer for the Missionary School of Medicine due to his contributions to the formation of the school's endowment fund.
