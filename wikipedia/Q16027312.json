The work was given in the Americas and across Europe. The Berlin premiere of 1893 so excited Ferruccio Busoni that he drafted a letter to Verdi, in which he addressed him as \"Italy's leading composer\" and \"one of the noblest persons of our time\", and in which he explained that \"Falstaff provoked in me such a revolution of spirit that I can\u00a0... date [to the experience] the beginning of a new epoch in my artistic life.\"Beaumont (1987), pp. 53\u201354. Antonio Scotti played the title role in Buenos Aires in July 1893; Gustav Mahler conducted the opera in Hamburg in January 1894; a Russian translation was presented in St Petersburg in the same month. Paris was regarded by many as the operatic capital of Europe, and for the production there in April 1894 Boito, who was fluent in French, made his own translation with the help of the Parisian poet Paul Solanges.Hepokoski, pp. 76\u201377 This translation, approved by Verdi, is quite free in its rendering of Boito's original Italian text. Boito was content to delegate the English and German translations to William Beatty-Kingston and Max Kalbeck respectively. The London premiere, sung in Italian, was at Covent Garden on 19 May 1894. The conductor was Mancinelli, and Zilli and Pini Corsi repeated their original roles. Falstaff was sung by Arturo Pessina; Maurel played the role at Covent Garden the following season.\"Performance History\", programme booklet, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, 6 December 1999, p. 43 On 4 February 1895 the work was first presented at the Metropolitan Opera, New York;Kimbell, p. 461 Mancinelli conducted and the cast included Maurel as Falstaff, Emma Eames as Alice, Z\u00e9lie de Lussan as Nannetta and Sofia Scalchi as Mistress Quickly.\"Verdi's great Falstaff, The New York Times, 5 February 1895"]}, {"page": "La Tosca", "response": ["*Giacomo Puccini: Tosca \u2013 Complete libretto of the opera in the original Italian and in English translation by William Beatty-Kingston at the Internet Archive"]}, {"page": "Reichshund", "response": ["Bismarck's dogs came to the public's attention and began to be called 'Reichshund' after Tyras attacked the Russian chancellor, Alexander Gorchakov, at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.

Her public debut was a concert organized by impresario Andreoli in Milan on 2 April 1882. The program included four arias from Handel, Haydn, Jommelli, and Rossini. Schumann and Schubert were her specialities for recitals. A review by William Beatty-Kingston in The Theatre praised the two chamber music recitals she gave at Prince's Hall in July 1886. He referred to her as the best cantatrice di camera in Europe and described her singing as \"the outcome of a rare and surprising combination of natural gifts and indefatigable cultivation.\" Her program for the recitals illustrated the development of vocal music since the 17th century. Beatty-Kingston wrote that \"All the laudatory adjectives in my vocabulary are insufficient to express my sense of the beauty, grace and poetical feeling characterising her rendering of these compositions, one and all.\" In addition to singing, she performed as a violinist on occasion. Barbi spent considerable time abroad, traveling to Austria, Germany, England, and Russia."]}, {"page": "Le grand mogol", "response": ["Reviewing the London adaptation, William Beatty-Kingston wrote in The Theatre, \"There is not a spontaneous or unaffected melody in the whole work \u2026 a dull work of minute intrinsic value.\"Beatty-Kingston, William. \"The Grand Mogul\", The Theatre, 1 December 1884, p. 293  The Times expressed regret that so intelligent an artist as Florence St John should have let herself be involved in so inane a spectacle, and added, \"M.
