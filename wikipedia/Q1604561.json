William's sister, the poet and diarist Dorothy Wordsworth, to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the Earl of Abergavenny, was wrecked off the south coast of England; and Christopher, the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.", "In November 1791, Wordsworth visited Revolutionary France and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and Britain's tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year.Everett, Glenn, \"William Wordsworth: Biography\" at The Victorian Web, accessed 7 January 2007. The circumstances of his return and his subsequent behaviour raised doubts as to his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The Reign of Terror left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years.", "Between 1795\u20131797, Wordsworth wrote his only play, The Borderers, a verse tragedy set during the reign of King Henry III of England, when Englishmen in the North Country came into conflict with Scottish border reivers. He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797, but it was rejected by Thomas Harris, the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, who proclaimed it \"impossible that the play should succeed in the representation\". The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revision.Stephen Gill, William Wordsworth: A Life, Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. 132\u2013133.", "William Wordsworth died at home at Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of pleurisy on 23 April 1850,\"Poet Laureate\", The British Monarchy official website.Stephen Gill, William Wordsworth: A Life, Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. 422\u20133. and was buried at St Oswald's Church, Grasmere.

While Traherne credits a divine source for its creation, his praise of nature seems nothing less than what one would expect to find in Thoreau. Many scholars consider Traherne a writer of the sublime, and in his writing he seems to have tried to reclaim the lost appreciation for the natural world, as well as paying tribute to what he knew of in nature that was more powerful than he was. In this sense Traherne seems to have anticipated the Romantic movement more than 130 years before it actually occurred. There is frequent discussion of man's almost symbiotic relationship with nature, as well as frequent use of \"literal setting\", that is, an attempt to faithfully reproduce a sense experience from a given moment, a technique later used frequently by William Wordsworth.", "Given Traherne's calling and piety, many modern settings of Traherne's work have a devotional context.
