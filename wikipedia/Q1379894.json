The repair bill of nearly \u00a3250,000 put the club in financial trouble; key players such as Alan Hudson, Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff were sold to cover the repairs. With the team depleted, Stoke were relegated in the 1976\u201377 season.

However, he could not prevent the club's relegation to the Second Division in 1976\u201377. Eastham left in January 1978 after only ten months in charge, and was replaced by Alan Durban from Shrewsbury Town. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in the 1978\u201379 season, but after consolidating the club's position in the First Division, he left to manage Sunderland in 1981. Richie Barker was appointed for the 1981\u201382 season, but was sacked in December 1983 and was replaced by Bill Asprey.

England began the campaign well with a 3\u20130 victory over Czechoslovakia at Wembley, Mick Channon and Colin Bell scoring the goals. However a 0\u20130 home draw with Portugal was a minor setback, despite Malcolm Macdonald scoring all the goals in a 5\u20130 win over Cyprus following a morale boosting 2\u20130 friendly win over 1974 FIFA World Cup champions West Germany. Kevin Keegan scored the only goal of the game at the Tsirion Stadium to secure maximum points in Cyprus, and leave England in a strong position going into the two tough final group games in Czechoslovakia and Portugal. Though only drawing with Wales and Northern Ireland, a 5\u20131 victory over Scotland secured England the 1974\u201375 British Home Championship title and left England in confident mood for the crucial qualifying games. However, despite Channon opening the scoring they fell to a 2\u20131 defeat to the Czechoslovakians in Bratislava after playing with what was for Revie uncharacteristic attacking tactics. A 1\u20131 draw in Lisbon then allowed Czechoslovakia to clinch the group with a win over Cyprus. Czechoslovakia then went on to win the whole tournament. Revie was criticised for his constant changing of players during the qualifying group, particularly his decision to drop captains Emlyn Hughes and Alan Ball from his squad entirely, his mistrust of flair players like Charlie George and Alan Hudson, and his willingness to play players out of position."]}, {"page": "Colin Bell", "response": ["Bell scored a brace in Don Revie's first game in charge of England, a 3\u20130 victory over Czechoslovakia. In Revie's third game in charge, Bell helped England defeat the then World Champions, Germany, 2\u20130, in 1975, at the one hundredth international game played at Wembley Stadium. The team that beat the Germans in that game consisted of a forward line-up of Channon, Keegan, Malcolm Macdonald, Alan Hudson and Alan Ball, as well as Bell. Channon commented that he did not understand why Revie did not continue with this line-up which he considered was as good as any forward line England had had since 1970. In the game against the West Germans, the energy and tackling of Bell and Ball had freed Hudson to show his full range of playmaking skills. Bell also helped England to win the 1974\u201375 British Home Championship. Bell played in a 0\u20130 draw with Northern Ireland, a 2\u20132 draw with Wales and a 5\u20131 victory against Scotland (in which he also scored)."]}, {"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["Despite the cup success and arrival of new signing Geoff Hurst, Stoke laboured to a 15th-place finish in 1972\u201373. Smith blamed the car crash and subsequent injury to Gordon Banks in October 1972 as the cause for the club's mid-season slump, which compounded an already poor start to the season. Any concerns over relegation disappeared though with six victories in the final eight league matches. After a poor start to 1973\u201374, Waddington signed Alan Hudson in January 1974 to help revive the club's fortunes. The defence also improved, as Smith helped to ensure only two goals were conceded in the last nine matches of the season as Stoke finished fifth. On 23 February 1974, Smith scored the winning goal against Leeds to end their opponent's 29-match unbeaten run. Leeds went on to have a \u00a3250,000 bid for Smith turned down by Stoke in the summer.", "He underwent an operation to remove cartilage in his knee in November 1975, and his recovery was not entirely successful. He later admitted that after returning to match fitness from the injury he was only ever able to play at \"half pace\". His long-term replacement was young defender Alan Dodd. The club also faced a major decline following a gale which severely damaged the Victoria Ground's Butler Street stand, and a lack of adequate insurance cover left a significant repair bill meaning the club had to sell Alan Hudson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Sean Haslegrave and Ian Moores to fund the repair; Eric Skeels and John Ritchie also retired. Waddington filled in the gaps left by these players with youngsters, and it also meant that Smith could continue to be a regular for the club despite his reduced mobility. Waddington was dismissed in March 1976, and new manager George Eastham failed to prevent Stoke from being relegated at the end of 1976\u201377. Following relegation Smith formed another good partnership, this time with Mike Doyle, which helped Stoke gain promotion in 1978\u201379 under new manager Alan Durban. Smith claimed his two seasons in the Second Division were \"boring\", as even with his reduced mobility few attackers in the division posed too much of a threat for him."]}, {"page": "Sammy McIlroy", "response": ["Stoke City paid Manchester United a club record fee of \u00a3350,000 for McIlroy on 2 February 1982. He arrived at Stoke with the club in deep relegation trouble in 1981\u201382 and he played in 18 matches as Stoke avoided the drop by two points. In 1982\u201383 Stoke had a solid midfield with McIlroy playing alongside former Manchester United team-mate Mickey Thomas, Mark Chamberlain and Paul Bracewell and the side finished in a mid-table position of 13th in 1982\u201383. However the 1983\u201384 season saw Stoke struggle again and McIlroy and the returning Alan Hudson helped Stoke stage a revival which saw they stay up by two points. In 1984\u201385 Stoke suffered an embarrassing relegation going down with a then record low points tally of 17 with McIlroy winning the player of the year award. He was handed a free transfer in the summer of 1985 and McIlroy went on to play at Manchester City in the 1985\u201386 season, Swedish club \u00d6rgryte IS in 1986, Bury from 1986 to 1989 and Preston North End from 1989 to 1991.

He hit ten goals in 44 games in 1973\u201374, not including his brace against Hull City in the final of the Watney Cup at the Victoria Ground. Greenhoff then began to play to the best of his abilities with the arrival of Alan Hudson. He scored fifteen goals in 47 games in 1974\u201375, making him the club's top-scorer for a second time after he outscored Terry Conroy and Geoff Hurst by two and four goals respectively. A volley against former club Birmingham in December 1974 was voted ITV's goal of the season. He hit thirteen goals in 46 games in 1975\u201376, making him the club's joint-top scorer along with Ian Moores. England manager Don Revie picked Greenhoff to play against Wales in March 1976, but he was unable to play due to it clashing with a league fixture, and never got another chance at international level."]}, {"page": "Dave Sexton", "response": ["Sexton started off as a coach at Chelsea, before leaving to begin his managerial career at Leyton Orient in 1965. In 1966 he was appointed by Arsenal manager Bertie Mee as the Gunners' first-team coach, but a year later returned to Chelsea to become manager following the departure of Tommy Docherty. He led the club to FA Cup success in 1970 and the European Cup Winners' Cup a year later. Chelsea also reached the League Cup final in 1972, but lost to Stoke City. However, Sexton fell out with several players, including Peter Osgood and Alan Hudson, who were subsequently sold. This, combined with other problems at the club, ensured that Sexton did not come close to repeating his earlier success and early in the 1974\u201375 season \u2013 which ended in Chelsea's relegation \u2013 he was dismissed."]}, {"page": "Peter Storey", "response": ["Mee retired in the summer of 1976, and his successor was Terry Neill, who was the Arsenal captain when Storey made his debut.

Storey played his final game for Arsenal on 29 January 1977, replacing Malcolm Macdonald as a substitute in a 3\u20131 victory over Coventry City in the FA Cup. He refused to train with the reserves and was again suspended by the club before accepting a free transfer to Fulham in March 1977."]}]}}
