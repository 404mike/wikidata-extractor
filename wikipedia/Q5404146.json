She is best known for the ballad Roddy McCorley and the Song of Ciabh\u00e1n; the latter was set to music by Ivor Gurney. In Belfast in the late 1890s, with Alice Milligan she produced The Shan Van Vocht, a nationalist monthly of literature, history and comment that gained a wide circulation in Ireland and in the Irish diaspora. Her poetry was collected and published after her death under the pen name Ethna Carberry, adopted following her marriage to the poet Seumas MacManus in 1901.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aos S\u00ed", "response": ["* MacManus, Anna (Ethna Carbery).
