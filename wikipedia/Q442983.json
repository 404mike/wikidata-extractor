Burnside (1839\u20131920).\n\nWilliam Burnside (2 July 1852 \u2013 21 August 1927) was an English mathematician. He is known mostly as an early researcher in the theory of finite groups.\nBurnside was born in London in 1852. He went to school at Christ's Hospital until 1871 and attended St. John's and Pembroke Colleges at the University of Cambridge, where he was the Second Wrangler (bracketed with George Chrystal) in 1875. He lectured at Cambridge for the following ten years, before being appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich. While this was a little outside the main centres of British mathematical research, Burnside remained a very active researcher, publishing more than 150 papers in his career.\nBurnside's early research was in applied mathematics. This work was of sufficient distinction to merit his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1893, though it is little remembered today. Around the same time as his election his interests turned to the study of finite groups. This was not a widely studied subject in Britain in the late 19th century, and it took some years for his research in this area to gain widespread recognition.\nThe central part of Burnside's group theory work was in the area of group representations, where he helped to develop some of the foundational theory, complementing, and sometimes competing with, the work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, who began his research in the subject during the 1890s. One of Burnside's best known contributions to group theory is his paqb theorem, which shows that every finite group whose order is divisible by fewer than three distinct primes is solvable.\nIn 1897 Burnside's classic work Theory of Groups of Finite Order was published. The second edition (pub. 1911) was for many decades the standard work in the field. A major difference between the editions was the inclusion of character theory in the second.Burnside is also remembered for the formulation of Burnside's problem that concerns the question of bounding the size of a group if there are fixed bounds both on the order of all of its elements and the number of elements  needed to generate it, and also for Burnside's lemma (a formula relating the number of orbits of a permutation group acting on a set with the number of fixed points of each of its elements) though the latter had been discovered earlier and independently by Frobenius and Augustin Cauchy.\nHe received an honorary doctorate (D.Sc.) from the University of Dublin in June 1901.In addition to his mathematical work, Burnside was a noted rower. While he was a lecturer at Cambridge, he also coached the rowing crew team. In fact, his obituary in The Times took more interest in his athletic career, calling him \"one of the best known Cambridge athletes of his day\".\nHe is buried at the West Wickham Parish Church in South London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Group (mathematics)", "response": ["The convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with Camille Jordan's  (1870). Walther von Dyck (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an \"abstract group\", in the terminology of the time. As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and William Burnside, who worked on representation theory of finite groups, Richard Brauer's modular representation theory and Issai Schur's papers. The theory of Lie groups, and more generally locally compact groups was studied by Hermann Weyl, \u00c9lie Cartan and many others. Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of algebraic groups, was first shaped by Claude Chevalley (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of Armand Borel and Jacques Tits."]}, {"page": "Simple group", "response": ["At about the same time, it was shown that a family of five groups, called the Mathieu groups and first described by \u00c9mile L\u00e9onard Mathieu in 1861 and 1873, were also simple. Since these five groups were constructed by methods which did not yield infinitely many possibilities, they were called \"sporadic\" by William Burnside in his 1897 textbook."]}, {"page": "Burnside problem", "response": ["The Burnside problem asks whether a finitely generated group in which every element has finite order must necessarily be a finite group. It was posed by William Burnside in 1902, making it one of the oldest questions in group theory and was influential in the development of combinatorial group theory. It is known to have a negative answer in general, as Evgeny Golod and Igor Shafarevich provided a counter-example in 1964. The problem has many refinements and variants (see bounded and restricted below) that differ in the additional conditions imposed on the orders of the group elements, some of which are still open questions.

Its various eponyms are based on William Burnside, George P\u00f3lya, Augustin Louis Cauchy, and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius. The result is not due to Burnside himself, who merely quotes it in his book 'On the Theory of Groups of Finite Order', attributing it instead to .", "William Burnside stated and proved this lemma, attributing it to , in his 1897 book on finite groups. But, even prior to Frobenius, the formula was known to Cauchy in 1845. In fact, the lemma was apparently so well known that Burnside simply omitted to attribute it to Cauchy. Consequently, this lemma is sometimes referred to as the lemma that is not Burnside's (see also Stigler's law of eponymy). This is less ambiguous than it may seem: Burnside contributed many lemmas to this field."]}, {"page": "Hyperbolic sector", "response": ["The analogy between circular and hyperbolic functions was described by Augustus De Morgan in his Trigonometry and Double Algebra (1849).Augustus De Morgan (1849) Trigonometry and Double Algebra, Chapter VI: \"On the connection of common and hyperbolic trigonometry\" William Burnside used such triangles, projecting from a point on the hyperbola xy = 1 onto the main diagonal, in his article \"Note on the addition theorem for hyperbolic functions\".William Burnside (1890) Messenger of Mathematics 20:145\u20138, see diagram page 146"]}, {"page": "Burnside", "response": ["* William Burnside (1852\u20131927), English mathematician", "* William Burnside (comics), a fictional incarnation of Captain America"]}, {"page": "West Wickham", "response": ["*William Burnside, mathematician, buried in West Wickham parish church."]}]}}
