After a board of directors' meeting O'Casey agreed to modify some of the terms used as well as to cut out Rosie Redmond's song in act II that was deemed as being especially offensive. George O'Brien, the government nominee on the Abbey Theatre's board of directors, argued that a theatre that received a state subsidy should reflect the values of the state and that disregarding this could lead to the formation of hostile movements that would make it difficult for the government to continue funding the Abbey. Viewing this as a threat, Lady Gregory wrote to O'Brien stating that \"If we have to choose between the subsidy and our freedom, it is our freedom we choose.\" Yeats agreed with Lady Gregory and argued that removing any part of the play for reasons relating to anything other than dramatic tradition would be denying their traditions."]}, {"page": "George O'Brien", "response": ["George O'Brien may refer to:", "*George O'Brien (actor) (1899\u20131985), American film actor", "*George O'Brien (baseball) (1889\u20131966), American baseball player", "*George O'Brien (cricketer) (born 1984), Bermudian cricketer", "*George O'Brien (cyclist) (born 1931), British cyclist", "*George O'Brien (footballer, born 1935) (born 1935), Scottish football player for Dunfermline Athletic, Leeds United and Southampton", "*George O'Brien (1900s footballer), English football player for Manchester United", "*George O'Brien (Irish politician) (1892\u20131973), Irish politician, economist and academic", "*George O'Brien (painter) (1821\u20131888), New Zealand painter", "*George O'Brien (writer) (born 1945), Irish academic and writer of short fiction and memoir", "*George O'Brien, a fictional politician in the Kingston Trio song \"M.T.A.\""]}]}}
