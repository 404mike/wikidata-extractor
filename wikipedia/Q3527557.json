(1855-1900)", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bates", "wikipedia_page": {"main": "Willie Bates (19 November 1855 \u2013 8 January 1900), known as Billy Bates, was an English cricketer. Skilled with both bat and ball, Bates scored over 10,000 first-class runs, took more than 870 wickets and was always reliable in the field. A snappy dresser, Bates was also known as \"The Duke\".\nBorn to a humble family in Lascelles Hall, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, Bates became a professional cricketer for Rochdale in 1873 and made his first-class debut for Yorkshire four years later, taking four for 69 in Middlesex's first innings to begin a ten-year career in the first-class game. He played fifteen Test matches for England between 1881\u201382 and 1886\u201387, all of them in Australia.\nAt the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1882/83, Bates excelled by scoring 55 in England's only innings before taking 7 for 28 (including a hat-trick) to force Australia to follow on. He then claimed 7 for 74 in the second innings to help his team to the first-ever innings victory in Test cricket. Bates set several individual records in this game as his hat-trick was the first for England in Test cricket, and his return of 7 for 28, and his match tally of 14 wickets, were then the best-ever by a Test match bowler. In addition, no Test bowler had previously taken 10 or more wickets and scored a half-century in the same match.\nIn domestic cricket, Bates topped 100 first-class wickets only once, when he took 121 in 1881, but he passed 80 on another 4 occasions. His best bowling of 8 for 21 was achieved in 1879 for Yorkshire against Surrey at The Oval. As a batsman he passed 1,000 runs in 5 seasons and scored 10 centuries, including 3 in 1884. He made his highest first-class score of 144 not out in 1882 for Under 30 v Over 30 at Lord's, where he also returned an economical second-innings analysis of 22\u201315\u201317\u20133.\nThe end of Bates' career came suddenly. On a non-Test tour of Australia with G.F. Vernon's XI in 1887\u201388, he was bowling in the nets when he was hit in the eye by a ball struck by a teammate. His eyesight was sufficiently impaired that he was never able to play first-class cricket again, although he did appear in club cricket in the early 1890s and was still able to coach.\nHis enforced retirement caused him great depression. On the voyage home from Australia, he attempted suicide and, at the end of December 1899, caught a chill whilst attending the funeral of fellow Yorkshire player John Thewlis. His condition quickly deteriorated and he died a few days later in Huddersfield, aged just 44.An interesting feature of Bates' Test career was that all 15 of his matches were played outside England, which is still the Test record for most matches in a complete career without ever playing at home.His son William Bates had a long first-class career with Yorkshire and Glamorgan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Melbourne Cricket Ground", "response": ["| Billy Bates", "| Billy Bates", "| Billy Bates"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket records", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Billy Bates || 821 || 50", "|  Billy Bates ||  || Melbourne Cricket Ground || 1882\u201383"]}, {"page": "Sydney Cricket Ground", "response": ["| Billy Bates"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Billy Bates"]}, {"page": "Ted Bates (footballer)", "response": ["Edric Thornton Bates MBE (3 May 1918 \u2013 28 November 2003) was a former Southampton F.C. player, manager, director and president which earned him the sobriquet Mr. Southampton.

He was the grandson of Billy Bates who was one of the finest all-rounders for England in the early years of international cricket."]}, {"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["In a tribute to Hawke, the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack related that Hawke's \"strength of the character was tested\" when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of \"elements that were not entirely harmonious\". Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgment and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England\". Derek Birley commented on the Yorkshire team to 1883 as \"gifted but scarcely house-trained professionals\" who were often described as \"ten drunks and a parson\".Birley, pp. 134\u2013135. The odd man out was Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for them. Their best players included Emmett, Ephraim Lockwood, George Ulyett, Ted Peate, Billy Bates and Allen Hill, while Bobby Peel made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882. Birley added that their performances and \"rough-hewn image\" had become an embarrassment to the gentlemanly wing of the club and the decision was taken to appoint a captain who would \"instill discipline and sobriety into this wayward team\".", "Although some people assumed that Hawke had turned his back on Yorkshire, he returned with new vigour in 1886 to begin what he himself referred to as his consistent association with the county. While Hawke had formerly been the figurehead who tossed the coin, he now took complete charge of operations and began the transformation of the team in earnest.Coldham, p. 47. The team that Hawke inherited from Emmett, which Hawke referred to as \"the boys of my old brigade\", was in decline by 1886 and several players would retire or be dismissed during the next couple of years so that, by the end of the 1887 season, it was clear that Yorkshire faced what Coldham called \"a protracted period of rebuilding\".Coldham, p. 59. Within the next seasons, the likes of Ted Peate, Billy Bates, Tom Emmett, Louis Hall and George Ulyett had all retired. Left arm spinner Bobby Peel, wicket-keeper David Hunter, all-rounder George Hirst, opening batsman Jack Brown and the amateurs Stanley Jackson and Ernest Smith were among the replacements who formed Yorkshire's successful teams of the 1890s and 1900s.Hodgson, p. 53."]}, {"page": "ICC Men's Player Rankings", "response": ["| 1887 || Arthur Shrewsbury ||  || Billy Bates || "]}, {"page": "Louis Hall", "response": ["Defensive by nature, Hall was not an attractive batsman, with his primary shot being the front foot defence. He was awarded a benefit match against Surrey in 1890, but he deferred it so that the injured Billy Bates could have his that year. Hall's benefit match, against Surrey at Sheffield in 1891, earned him 570 pounds. After his active career ended in 1894, he served as a coach at Uppingham School."]}, {"page": "Tom Emmett", "response": ["Born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, Emmett first joined Yorkshire when almost 25 as a professional fast left-arm bowler with a near roundarm action, though in his later years he took to bowling slow-medium. Once discovered, however, Emmett climbed almost immediately to the top of the cricketing tree, playing for England against Surrey & Sussex in Tom Lockyer's benefit match at the Oval in 1867, his second season. An even greater bowler, George Freeman, was approaching his best at the same time, and, from 1867 to the end of 1871, they dominated the English bowling scene. After 1871, however, business commitments took Freeman away from first-class cricket, but Emmett stayed on and found another able colleague in the excellent Allen Hill. In later years, Emmett shared the Yorkshire bowling duties with George Ulyett, Billy Bates, Ted Peate and Bobby Peel. He called his most famous delivery the \"sostenuter\": after pitching on leg the ball would break back a long way to take the off-stump. As time went on, Emmett's pace deserted him."]}, {"page": "Tom Cole (umpire)", "response": ["A timeless Test, the match lasted four days, starting on 12 December and ending on 16 December, with 14 December as a rest day.
