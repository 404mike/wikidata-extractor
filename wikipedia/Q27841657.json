There he was a Member of His Majesty's Colonial Council of Sierra Leone and was thus accorded the title of 'Honorable'. In 1841 papers were found aboard the Segunda Rosario, a ship engaged in the slave trade condemned at the Havana Mixed Commission Court. This raised concerns that Campbell was involved in the slave trade. When Campbell was subsequently investigated, he replied that he had been engaged in trade with Niara Bely (aka Isabela Lightbourn) for sixteen years but only as regards legitimate commodities such as ivory, hides, wax, gold and coffee. Although Mrs Lightbourn also herself engaged in the slave trade, Campbell denied any personally involvement, and indeed claimed that he had suffered personal losses following the destruction of his property on the Nunez River, owing to his opposition to the slave trade.:\u200a21\u200aHe was appointed as Consul in Lagos on 21 July 1853 and served in this capacity until his death on 17 April 1859.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bight of Biafra", "response": ["*1853\u2014April 1859          Benjamin Campbell"]}, {"page": "Ben Campbell", "response": ["* Benjamin Campbell, founder of Campbell, California", "* Benjamin Campbell (consular agent) (died 1859), British merchant and consular agent"]}, {"page": "Efunroye Tinubu", "response": ["In December 1851 and under the pretext of abolishing slavery, the British bombarded Lagos, dislodged Kosoko from the throne, and installed a more amenable Akitoye as Oba of Lagos. Though Akitoye signed a treaty with Britain outlawing the slave trade, Tinubu subverted the 1852 treaty and secretly traded slaves for guns with Brazilians and Portuguese traders. Further, she obtained a tract of land from Akitoye which now constitutes part of the present-day Tinubu Square and Kakawa Street. Later, a conflict developed between Tinubu and some slave traders including Possu, a Kosoko loyalist. Consequently, Possu, Ajenia, and other traders tried to instigate an uprising against Akitoye because of Madam Tinubu's influence in Lagos. In the interest of peace, Benjamin Campbell, the British Consul in Lagos, asked Akitoye to exile Tinubu. After Akitoye died, Tinubu returned to Lagos and gave her support to his successor, Dosunmu. Under Dosunmu's reign Tinubu had a massive security force composed of slaves and she sometimes executed orders usually given by the king. As a result, Dosunmu grew wary of her influence in Lagos. A new development was the colonial government's  support for the return of repatriated captives (mostly of Yoruba heritage) to settle in Lagos. Many of the returnees, also called Saro, were favored by the British in commerce and soon began dominating legitimate trade in Lagos."]}, {"page": "Lagos Colony", "response": ["In the first half of the 19th century, the Yoruba hinterland was in a state of near-constant warfare due to internal conflicts and incursions from the northern and western neighbouring states. By then the fortified island of Lagos had become a major centre of the slave trade. The United Kingdom abolished import of slaves to their colonies in 1807 and abolished slavery in all British territories in 1833. The British became increasingly active in suppressing the slave trade. At the end of 1851 a naval expedition bombarded Lagos into submission, deposed Oba Kosoko, installed the more amenable Oba Akitoye, and signed the Great Britain-Lagos treaty that made slavery illegal in Lagos on January 1, 1852. A few months later Louis Fraser  from the Bight of Benin consulate was posted to the island as vice-Consul. The next year Lagos was upgraded to a full consulate with Benjamin Campbell appointed as Consul."]}, {"page": "Ajele Cemetery", "response": ["* Consul Benjamin Campbell"]}, {"page": "John MacCormac", "response": ["MacCormac was one of the wealthiest merchants in Sierra Leone and he was appointed by His Majesty's Colonial Council of Sierra Leone in the 1820s. MacCormac was a contemporary of Honorable Kenneth Macaulay, a Scottish merchant and colonial official in Sierra Leone, who served on the Colonial Council of Sierra Leone. MacCormac also served on the Colonial Council alongside Benjamin Campbell, a British merchant of Scottish descent who served as the first Consul-General to the Lagos Colony. MacCormac and Campbell entered into a treaty with the Koya Temne on behalf of Governor Alexander Findlay the representative of the Crown colonial government."]}, {"page": "Niara Bely", "response": ["In 1841, when Benjamin Campbell was investigated for involvement in the slave trade, he freely admitted that he had done business with \"Mrs Lightbourn\", but said that he had only bought legitimate goods such as ivory, hides, wax, gold and coffee."]}, {"page": "Segunda Rosario", "response": ["In 1840 Segunda Rosario set sail for West Africa from Havana laden with tobacco and \"ready made clothes\".

A second document signed by Benjamin Campbell certifying that John Boson was a free native of Rio Pongo and that he had hired himself as cook for the vessel.

Gollmer but withheld this information from the paramount chiefs, instead inquiring from them who Akitoye's heir should be. In unison, the chiefs agreed that Dosunmu was the rightful heir and only then did Campbell relay the news of Akitoye's death to them. Campbell then informed Dosunmu about his accession to the Obaship followed by hasty accession ceremonies at the palace.
