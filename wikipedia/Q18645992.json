Greenway was let out to a series of tenants until it was sold twice in quick succession, the last time to Richard Harvey\u2014a Cornish copper and tin magnate\u2014and his wife Susannah. The Harveys developed the estate extensively, restoring the stables and lodge house, installing two new greenhouses and redecorating the interior. They restored much of Galmpton, including building the village school and the Manor Inn; Harvey also acquired the Lordship of the manor of Galmpton. Harvey died in 1870, his wife in 1882; they had no children to pass the estate on to, and it was sold for \u00a344,000 to Thomas Bedford Bolitho. Bolitho, the industrialist MP for St Ives, added what Burdett describes as \"a Cornish influence\" on the gardens, introducing plants such as Camellias, magnolias, rhododendrons and laurels. He built a new east wing to the house in 1892, which included a billiard room, study and bedrooms; this was demolished in 1938. Bolitho died in 1919 and the house passed to his daughter Mary, and her husband, Charles Williams, whose family owned Caerhays Castle near St Michael Caerhays, Cornwall. Between them the couple added several new varieties of plants from nurseries in Cornwall. In 1937 they returned to Cornwall and sold the estate to Alfred Goodson.

Despite the company's long association with sailing ships, he was able to convince his sceptical father that the future of shipping depended on steam. He visited the shipyard of John Readhead & Co at South Shields with finance provided by Bolitho's bank (the forerunner of Barclays; a director, Thomas Bedford Bolitho, preceded Hain as MP of St Ives) and placed the first of many orders for the company. The first steamer was launched on 19 November 1878 and named Trewidden in honour of the Bolitho estate outside Penzance.
