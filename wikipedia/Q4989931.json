He worked in a rubber factory until he was 15 when he continued with his education. His education was paid for through donations when it was heard that poems he had published when he was 14 and later in London in June 1896 were from a factory worker.\nIn 1900 he won a history scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1904. He secured a lectureship to the University of Sheffield following graduation. In 1912 he published his first book, The Normans in Lower Italy.\nHe applied for the then vacant Erasmus Smith's Chair of Modern History at Trinity College Dublin and was appointed in 1914. He held this post for 25 years. After, from 1939, he held the Lecky Chair of History (also at Trinity) for the 4 years prior to his death in 1943.\nAs part of his work with the Irish Manuscripts Commission he published with R. B. McDowell the Irish Historical Documents, 1172-1922 on the year of his death.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Confederate Ireland", "response": ["The first Confederate General Assembly was held in Kilkenny on 24 October 1642, where it set up a provisional government.

Se\u00e1n Duffy is not the author, editor or publisher but he provides valuable biographical data on the actual author (many \"classic\" book usually have this kind of preface describing the author or the circumstances of the book's publication). In effect we're not actually citing the book author but the separate writer of the introduction. How do I do this ?

Using the 'other' and 'page' fields as suggested above will get the right information into the citation, but not ideally formatted. Perhaps there really should be an additional field to support this, such as a 'mainauthor' field (Edmund Curtis in this example) that can be used in cases where a non-compilation has a single chapter or section (mostly commonly an introduction/preface or afterword) by a different author. --RL0919 (talk) 13:51, 10 August 2009 (UTC)"]}, {"page": "Agnes Conway", "response": ["*(with a chapter by Edmund Curtis) Henry VII's relations with Scotland and Ireland, 1485-1498 (1932).
