As a result, she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged the rest of her career.Pope, p. 138 The writer and feminist Laura Ormiston Chant, who was a member of the Social Purity Alliance, disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances, and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes. Her campaign persuaded the London County Council to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, as part of the licensing conditions.Farson, p. 64\"Sources for the history of London Theatres and Music Halls at London Metropolitan Archives\" , London Metropolitan Archives, Information Leaflet Number 47, pp. 6\u20137, accessed 23 December 2017 The screens were unpopular and protesters, among them the young Winston Churchill, later pulled them down.Gillies, p. 315Gillies, p. 89 That November at the Tivoli theatre, Lloyd performed \"Johnny Jones\", a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend.Gillies, p. 101 The song, although not lyrically obscene, was considered to be offensive largely because of the manner in which Lloyd sang it, adding winks and gestures, and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience. Social reformers cited \"Johnny Jones\" as being offensive, but less so compared to other songs of the day.Gillies, p. 102 Upon the expiry of a music hall's entertainments licence, the Licensing Committee tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal. As a result, Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee.Pope, p. 140 She sang \"Oh! Mr Porter\" (composed for her by George Le Brunn); \"A Little of What You Fancy\"; and, according to some writers, \"She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas\",Nuttall, Carmichael, p. 34 which she retitled \"I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks\" after some protest.\"The BBC should see the funny side of risqu\u00e9 humour\", The Telegraph (online edition), accessed 8 April 2013 The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss. Feeling disgruntled at the council's interference, she then rendered Alfred Tennyson's drawing-room ballad \"Come into the Garden, Maud\" with leers and nudges to illustrate each innuendo. The committee were left stunned at the performance,Pope, p. 141 but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was \"all in the mind\"."]}, {"page": "List of women's rights activists", "response": ["*Laura Ormiston Chant (1848 \u20131923) \u2013 social reformer, womens rights activist, writer, and member of the International Council of Women (1888)."]}, {"page": "Alice Ayres", "response": ["Emilia Aylmer Blake wrote perhaps the first poem about Ayres, titled Alice Ayres, which she recited at a social gathering in June 1885. Sir Francis Hastings Doyle also wrote a well-received poem in honour of Ayres, as did leading social reformer and women's rights campaigner Laura Ormiston Chant. By the late 1880s Ayres was coming to be seen as a model of British devotion to duty, and her story was told in collections of heroic and inspirational stories for children, including as the first story in F. J. Cross's influential Beneath the Banner, in which Cross remarked that: \"She had tried to do her best always. Her loving tenderness to the children committed to her care and her pure gentle life were remarked by those around her before there was any thought of her dying a heroic death.

In addition to literary activities, the club organized civics classes, which were addressed by city officials and state senators, and foreign-language classes. At its peak the club had over 300 members. Its motto was \"Lofty thoughts and kindly deeds,\" and its emblem was a pansy, a symbol of thought. The women worked to improve local schoolrooms, clean the streetcars, and elect women to the school board. They successfully campaigned for a half-holiday for store clerks, and published a book of proverbs. Honorary members included Mary Livermore and Laura Ormiston Chant.
