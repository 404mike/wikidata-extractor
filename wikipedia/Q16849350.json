He was also known variously as \"The Bard of Galloway\", the itinerant singer and \"pedlar-poet\", or \"Wandering Wull\". His best writing makes distinctive use of his native Scots language and many of his works are in the form of song.\nHe was encouraged by James Hogg and Dr. Alexander Murray. Nicholson's published collections include Tales, in Verse, and Miscellaneous Poems: Descriptive of Rural Life and Manners (1814), a work which contains some 60 original poems, including \"The Ghost of Crazy Jane\", \"The Fairy Dance\", and \"A Tale of Terror\", a number of which have been anthologised. One common anthology piece sometimes associated with his name is also \"The Aiken Drum\".\nHe is best remembered today for \"The Brownie of Blednoch\" (1828), a favourite of the poet Marion Angus (1865\u20131946), and \"The Braes of Galloway\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scottish Enlightenment", "response": ["* William Nicholson (1782\u20131849) poet "]}, {"page": "William Nicholson", "response": ["William Nicholson may refer to:", "*William Nicholson (bishop of Gloucester) (1591\u20131672), Bishop of Gloucester", "*William Nicholson (chemist) (1753\u20131815), English chemist, publisher, and inventor", "*William Nicholson (poet) (1782\u20131849), Scottish poet, known as the Bard of Galloway", "*William Nicholson (naval officer) (c. 1790 \u2013 1872), U.S. naval officer", "*William Nicholson (Australian politician) (1816\u20131865), Mayor of Melbourne and Premier of Victoria", "*William Nicholson, 1st Baron Nicholson (1845\u20131918), British Field Marshal and Chief of the Imperial General Staff", "*William Nicholson (artist) (William Newzam Prior Nicholson, 1872\u20131949), English painter and engraver", "*William Nicholson (artist, born 1781) (1781\u20131844), portrait-painter and etcher", "*William Nicholson (distiller) (1825\u20131909), British Member of Parliament for Petersfield, 1866\u20131874 and 1880\u20131885, cricketer and cricket benefactor", "*William Nicholson (Royal Navy officer) (1863\u20131932), British admiral", "*William Nicholson (journalist) (1877\u20131957), New Zealand clerk, local politician, builder, journalist and editor", "*William Nicholson (Reformed Episcopal bishop) (1822\u20131901), American bishop of the Reformed Episcopal Church", "*William Nicholson (writer) (born 1948), British screenwriter, playwright and novelist", "*William Nicholson (sound engineer) (born 1937)"]}, {"page": "Aiken Drum", "response": ["Aiken Drum is also the name given by the Scottish poet William Nicholson to the brownie in his poem \"The Brownie of Blednoch\" (1825).

The church no longer remains as a complete building, but two burial enclosures in the middle of the yard appear to incorporate some of the fabric of its original walls. There are gravestones and memorials in the churchyard dating back to the 18th century, and because Lance Corporal Francis James Elms, who died in October 1918 during the First World War, is buried there, the churchyard is registered as a Commonwealth War Grave. A carved stone cross, dated to the 11th or 12th century and now standing in the forecourt of the Stewartry Museum in Kirkcudbright, is thought to have been taken from the churchyard. The poet William Nicholson, who was born in Borgue, is buried in the graveyard, and there is a memorial to Robert McWhae, a Covenanter martyr killed in 1685."]}]}}
