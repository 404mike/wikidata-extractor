In 1835, Dublin shipowner Captain Richard Bourne joined the business, and the three men chartered the William Fawcett and started a regular steamer service between London and Spain and Portugal \u2013 the Iberian Peninsula \u2013 using the name Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, with services to Vigo, Oporto, Lisbon and C\u00e1diz. The company flag colours are directly connected with the Peninsular flags: the white and blue represent the Portuguese flag in 1837, and the yellow and red the Spanish flag. At the height of the Carlist Wars the British lent their support to the legitimate heirs of Spain and Portugal and all three of P&O founders played their part, from gun running to chartering steamers.

The Crown attempted to press gang Anderson but Bressay man Thomas Bolt persuaded the Royal Navy to wait until he had finished his apprenticeship before his impressment in 1808. Anderson was discharged 10 years later in Plymouth. Like many Shetland men, he was left destitute 600 miles from home after his service to King and country during the Napoleonic wars. Anderson moved to London and eventually became a clerk in the London shipping and insurance firm of Brodie McGhie Willcox where he became a partner in 1822 and the firm was renamed Wilcox and Anderson. They developed the shipping business between Britain and the Iberian peninsula, at one stage shipping guns and the British Legion to fight Portuguese conservatives and Spanish Carlists during their internal wars of the 1830s."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Brodie McGhie Willcox||Liberal"]}, {"page": "P&O Cruises", "response": ["In 1834, Brodie McGhie Willcox, a ship broker from London, and Arthur Anderson, a sailor from the Shetland Islands, formed an association with Captain Richard Bourne, a steamship owner from Dublin. In 1837, the trio won a contract and began transporting mail and passengers from England to the Iberian Peninsula, founding the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company. In 1840, the company merged with the Transatlantic Steam Ship Company and expanded their operations to the Orient, becoming the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O). In 1844, P&O expanded its passenger operations from transportation to leisure cruising, operating sailings from England to the Mediterranean that were the first of their kind. By the mid-1900s, passenger shipping for the purposes of transportation was threatened by the increasing affordability of air travel. Consequently, in the 1970s, P&O dedicated its passenger operations entirely to leisure cruising and, in 1977, relisted its passenger ships under the new subsidiary P&O Cruises."]}, {"page": "Southampton (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Brodie McGhie Willcox"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1857 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Southampton(two members)||Brodie McGhie Willcox||Liberal"]}, {"page": "Brodie McGhie Wilcox", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brodie McGhie Willcox"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1857\u20131868)", "response": ["|Brodie McGhie Willcox"]}, {"page": "William Fawcett (paddle steamer)", "response": ["In 1835 Bourne partnered with Brodie McGhie Willcox and Arthur Anderson to charter the William Fawcett for five voyages between London and the Iberian Peninsula.

In 1837 and again in early 1838, the ship was chartered by the Peninsular company for a trip from London to northern Spain and return. The ship was refitted later in 1838, and afterwards chartered by the Peninsular company for two trips between London and Madeira. The William Fawcett had been broken up by April 1845."]}]}}
