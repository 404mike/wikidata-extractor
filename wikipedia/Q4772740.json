As a junior officer, he took part in the Cape Frontier War of 1851 and then saw action at the Battle of Canton in December 1857 and the Battle of Taku Forts in May 1858 during Second Opium War. Once promoted to flag officer rank, he acted as Second-in-Command of the Fleet at the bombardment of Alexandria in July 1882 during the Anglo-Egyptian War. He went on to be First Naval Lord in September 1891 but in that role took a relaxed view of the size of the Fleet and did not see the need for a large shipbuilding effort on the scale envisaged by some of his colleagues, such as Admiral Sir Frederick Richards and Admiral Sir John Fisher who were concerned about French and German naval expansion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1901", "response": ["* June 21 \u2013 Anthony Hoskins, British admiral (b. 1828)"]}, {"page": "1828", "response": ["* September 1 \u2013 Anthony Hoskins, British admiral (d. 1901)"]}, {"page": "Second Sea Lord and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff", "response": ["* Admiral Sir Anthony Hoskins, 1885\u20131888"]}, {"page": "Hoskins", "response": ["*Anthony Hoskins (1828\u20131901), Royal Navy admiral and First Sea Lord"]}, {"page": "Mediterranean Fleet", "response": ["| align = left | Vice-Admiral Sir Anthony Hoskins"]}, {"page": "George Tryon", "response": ["In August 1891 Tryon was appointed to command the Mediterranean station, the most powerful force within the Royal Navy at that time. The Mediterranean was recognised as the sea area then of greatest importance to Britain.

Tryon assumed command on 21 September. The division toured Port Mahon, Madelena, Naples, Malta, Nauplia and Milo, where they were joined by the second division under rear-admiral Lord Walter Kerr. The fleet then exercised until November, when they again divided: the first division wintering at Malta while the second remained in the Levant.Fitzgerald pp. 313\u2013314"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty", "response": ["**Anthony Hoskins, Junior Naval Lord", "**Anthony Hoskins, Junior Naval Lord", "**Sir Anthony Hoskins, Second Naval Lord", "**Sir Anthony Hoskins, Second Naval Lord", "**Sir Anthony Hoskins, Second Naval Lord", "**Sir Anthony Hoskins, Second Naval Lord", "**Sir Anthony Hoskins, Second Naval Lord", "**Sir Anthony Hoskins, First Naval Lord", "**Sir Anthony Hoskins, First Naval Lord", "**Sir Anthony Hoskins, First Naval Lord"]}]}}
