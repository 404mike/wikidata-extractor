Records of the manor, the predecessor to Great Billing Hall, date back to the 12th century. It was originally owned by the Barry family and Baron Dundalk built it in 1629. It became the county seat of the Earls of Thomond, descendants of Brian Boru, King of Ireland in 1002. With the arrival of the Elwes family in 1779 the history of Great Billing became inextricably linked to them. Perhaps the Hall's most famous resident was Gervase Elwes, the English tenor, who died in a rail accident in Boston, USA in 1921.", "On Mr. Cary-Elwes' death, his son, Gervase Elwes, the famous tenor, took over the estate. Married to the Earl of Denbigh's daughter, Lady Winifride Feilding, and having a gregarious nature, he made the Hall and village both the centre of Catholic life and the musical focus for the area. Elwes was friends with many of the eminent musicians of the day including Ralph Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar. He was Elgar's favourite Gerontius, singing this demanding role 118 times. He held many musical soir\u00e9es at the Hall and famous musicians came from far and wide to attend. He and many members of his family, including his parents, his brother Bishop Dudley, and his son, Monsignor Valentine Elwes, who was parish priest of the village in the 1960s, are buried in the Catholic cemetery in the village. His second youngest daughter, Margaret, was buried there in 1997, aged 91 years. The Hall was sold in 1930 by Geoffrey Elwes and, a project for converting it into a home for indigent musicians in memory of Gervase Elwes having failed, it was sold again in 1935 to Mr. Hancock, a shoe-manufacturer of Northampton, and by him to Mr. J. P. B. Miller, who pulled down part of the Hall. In the village of Great Billing is a bronze memorial tablet to Gervase Elwes (d. 1921), the 'beloved squire' and famous singer.", "Although Billing Hall was not converted into a home for musicians, Elwes' contribution to music, his interest in amateur music-making, professional musicians who had fallen on hard times, and innovation created by composers, singers and instrumentalists working together, led to the foundation, in 1921, of the Gervase Elwes Memorial Fund for Musicians which was incorporated in 1930 as the Musicians Benevolent Fund."]}, {"page": "Oxford and Cambridge Musical Club", "response": ["*Gervase Elwes"]}, {"page": "Coenraad V.
