The new home kit for the season is a modern twist on the kit used during the 1914\u201315 season and pays tribute to the squad and the anniversary of McCrae's Battalion. The club lost seven players during World War I, John Allan, James Boyd, Duncan Currie, Ernest Ellis, Tom Gracie, James Speedie and Harry Wattie. As a mark of respect the kit features no sponsor and a unique badge. Speaking about the kit the club said that \u201cThe strip for season 2014/15 is dedicated to the club\u2019s greatest ever team which went to war in 1914,\u201d \u201cTheir efforts have been recorded in story and in song and we felt strongly that the centenary of this side should now be marked in an appropriate fashion by the current first-team players. \u201cHaving consulted the supporters about a commemorative crest, we believe the unique badge for the new season is another fitting tribute to the team of 1914\u201315 and we would like to take this opportunity to thank the SPFL and the Scottish FA for granting their approval of this change. The club's new home kit went on sale to people who had preordered on 15 May, priced at \u00a345.00 for an adults top with kids priced at \u00a335.00. The kit went on general public sale on 9 June, having been delayed from 15 May due to over 4,000 pre orders being taken for the new kit."]}, {"page": "Heart of Midlothian F.C. and World War I", "response": ["* Harry Wattie \u2013 killed in action, 1 July 1916", "Harry Wattie"]}, {"page": "Paddy Crossan", "response": ["Paddy married the sister of Harry Wattie on 30 July 1926."]}, {"page": "George Miller (footballer, born 1894)", "response": ["The Scottish League continued to operate during the war, and Miller replaced Harry Wattie (also a product of Tranent, who was one of the players training for the Western Front and who would ultimately perish at the Battle of the Somme).
