He was the son of Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton and brother-in-law of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn.

Sub-leases were very common at this time. The yearly rent was \u00a330 (besides taxes) and it consisted of a house, coach house, stable and other appurtenances. Just three years later, on the 19th May 1788, Crosbie (described as 'Richard Crosbie formerly of the City of Dublin, now of Ballycumber in the Kings County, Esquire') assigned the house back to Archibald Armstrong for the remainder of the 900 years. The same house was subsequently re-assigned back to Crosbie on the 1st October 1790, including \"several goods and articles of household furniture\". It is not known why the house changed hands so often. From the memorial we can see that the house adjoining Crosbie's to the north was one in which Henry Luttrell, 2nd Earl of Carhampton had lately lived. At some point prior to May 1827, a fire broke out at Crosbie's home on Cumberland Street destroying a number of original deeds relating to the leases and documents concerning the house.Extract from Registry of Deeds memorial: 827-288-556424.
