For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy. Aaron Sidwell was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him.

Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive. I still wake up and think: 'Oh my God, I'm in EastEnders.' It's brilliant.\" Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said \"[Steven] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how he kind of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded...

He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man \u2013 and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's nothing you can do about it and if you try to hide it, people get hurt.\" After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him, as a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales' lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out, and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality.

Fi and Max make amends and suggests to her that she takes \u00a310,000 off the repairs bill to get the Carters on her side. The Carters accept her help to raise the money. Fi catches Luke throttling Josh and breaks them up and Josh is hurt that Fi is in on Project Dagmar whilst he is excluded. When Carmel finds a ring at her house left behind by Max, she thinks Max will propose and invites people to The Vic. Fi finds out that the Carters have raised \u00a350,000 and when Max arrive, the pair kiss and Carmel is devastated whilst people turn on Max. James, Luke and Hugo later arrive and James tells them they own Grafton Hill. They serve the Carters with an eviction notice, putting up the money owed to the original amount \u00a360,000. James reveals that they plan to turn their obtained buildings into luxury flats. When Max proposes to Fi, James and Luke reveal that they have used him as they have doubted his loyalty and burn his cheque. Kathy confronts Fi over what James did to her and about all the women James has destroyed, including her own mother. Whilst James and Fi attend a press launch, Josh downloads files that can get the development stopped and Lauren gets arresting when she stages a protest at the launch to hold James and Fi up. When James returns, Lauren contacts Josh and James demands the downloaded files, so Josh decides to quit his job. Fi tries to get Josh to return, but he tells Fi that James has ruined and controls their lives just like with their mothers. When Fi attempts to question James over why he never allowed Josh's mother Wendy to get a job or why Elizabeth committed suicide, James pushes her to the ground. Fi asks Kathy about the rape and her version causes Fi to be physically sick. When James shows Fi documents that could ruin him, Fi says she believes he did rape Kathy, causing James to throw her out. After reconciling with Max and confiding in him her inability to see her father for who he is until too late, Fi sneaks into James' office, trashes it and steals most of the documents. James suffers a heart attack while trying to destroy the remaining evidence pointing to him before the police arrest him and Fi threatens Hugo with the files into signing the company deeds to her. Fi visits Mick and Linda and offers them a chance to buy back the freehold for the Vic for \u00a3150,000. Linda rejects this offer, calling it unrealistic and telling her that her family will get their comeuppance. Fi agrees and leaves Walford after visiting Kathy with a letter giving her the cafe back. Fi visits James in hospital, telling him she is not going to keep on trying to get his approval as she wanted his love. As James reaches out for Fi, she tells staff that she is not his daughter and walks out on him for good. Off-screen, Fi later agrees to give The Vic back to Mick and Linda in exchange for a diamond ring, worth \u00a3200,000."]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders characters (1989)", "response": ["Steven Beale is played by Edward Farrell from 1989 to 1990, Stuart Stevens from 1992 to 1996, Edward Savage from 1997 to 2002, and Aaron Sidwell from 2007 to 2008 and 2016 to 2017.

She is the twin sister of Peter (Thomas Law), and has three half siblings, older brother Steven (Edward Savage, Aaron Sidwell), younger sister Cindy (Eva Sayer) and younger brother Bobby (Alex Francis). Apart from her on-screen birth, the character has few storylines of her own until 2004 when the role was recast to an older actress. Storylines featuring Lucy have since focused upon her teenage rebellion. In 2010, Suffield left EastEnders, after she was allegedly axed due to \"unruly behaviour.\" On 14 November 2011, it was announced Lucy would be returning in 2012 with Bywater taking over the role. She returned on 12 January 2012. In February 2014 it was announced that the character would be killed off. She made her final appearance on 22 April 2014 when her father goes to identify her body. In July 2007, Gareth McLean of The Guardian lamented the lack of strong female characters in EastEnders, noting that Lucy \"is yet to come into her own\". Fellow Guardian critic Grace Dent commented on the repetitive nature of EastEnders storylines by comparing Lucy's relationship with Jane (Laurie Brett) to the fraught mother-daughter bond between Kat (Jessie Wallace) and Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan).", "Peter Beale, played by Francis Brittin-Snell from 1993 to 1996, Alex Stevens from 1997 to 1998, Joseph Shade from 1998 to 2004, James Martin from 2004 to 2006, Thomas Law from 2006 until 2010 and Ben Hardy from 2013 onwards, is the son of Ian (Adam Woodyatt) and Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins).

Peter left EastEnders on 24 December 2010, with a return not ruled out but unconfirmed. Peter was introduced in 1993 along with his twin sister Lucy, and was originally played by Francis Brittin-Snell as a baby and toddler from 1993 to 1996. In 1997, the role was given to Alex Stevens and he played Peter until 1998. Joseph Shade took over until 2004 and James Martin played him from 2004 until 2006. It was announced on 17 August 2006 that actor Thomas Law had been cast as Peter. Law said of the role: \"I couldn't believe it when I heard that I got the part, I'm really excited as I am a big fan of EastEnders.\" He made his first appearance on 31 August 2006. He is described on the EastEnders website as being laid back, and Ian's \"golden boy\". In May 2009, Executive producer Diederick Santer praised the younger cast of EastEnders, including Law. Stuart Heritage from The Guardian expressed a dislike for Peter in April 2010, saying he should be written out, \"before his increasingly spectacular haircut goes power mad and starts to colonise the entire set.
