Unexpectedly, Lancashire managed to recover from the injury and returned to training, but remained on the bench until coming on as substitute for Jamie Allen in the 33rd minute of a 3\u20132 win over Leyton Orient on 27 September 2014. Following his return, Lancashire retained his first team place, captaining the side in a FA Cup first round 0\u20130 draw against Northampton Town. In the replay, Lancashire scored in the last minute to send Rochdale through to the next round.
