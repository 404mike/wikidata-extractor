He was successful at biology early on, receiving the Biological Council Prize upon leaving secondary school.  He then attended Oxford University, receiving a first class B.A. degree in 1981.  He did his PhD under Prof. Jamshed Tata at the National Institute for Medical Research, London.  He was awarded an EMBO long-term postdoctoral fellowship in 1984 and moved to the laboratory of Donald D. Brown at the Department of Embryology, Carnegie Institution of Washington in Baltimore. He joined the National Institute of Health in 1987, working firstly with Gary Felsenfeld in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases).  In 1990 he was appointed Chief of the newly founded Laboratory of Molecular Embryology (LME).  He left NIH and moved to the biotechnology firm Sangamo BioSciences Inc. in Richmond, California, in 2000, as Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer. He was a prolific writer, publishing hundreds of articles, literature reviews and two books.  He will be known mainly for his work in promoting the idea that chromatin plays a dynamic role in regulating gene expression.\nHe died as a result of injuries suffered in a road accident in Rio de Janeiro on 26 May 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wolffe", "response": ["* Alan Wolffe (1959\u20132001), British cell biologist"]}, {"page": "Sangamo Therapeutics", "response": ["* Alan Wolffe"]}, {"page": "Genevi\u00e8ve Almouzni", "response": ["From 1988 to 1989 and 1991 to 1993, she went to the United States to work as a post-doc in the research centre of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, in the laboratory of Professor Alan Wolffe.She has been a research director at the CNRS since January 2000."]}, {"page": "Mary Dasso", "response": ["In 1992, Dasso brought her UCSD cell cycle projects to the National Institutes of Health as a staff scientist in Alan Wolffe's laboratory of molecular embryology at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).
