He is best known for his 1997 album Earthbound which was released on Colin Lester's and Ian McAndrew's Wildstar label.\nReeves scored five Top 40 singles in the UK Singles Chart, was nominated for a Brit Award for British Breakthrough Act in the 1998 Brit Awards. He performed as support act for many singers, including Whitney Houston on her European tour in 1998.  After breaking with Wildstar Records, Reeves focused on writing songs for other artists like Artful Dodger, Joss Stone, Debbie McGee, Sami Yusuf, Joe Cocker and Tina Turner amongst many others..He gave his song \"As Love Is My Witness\" to the Irish pop band Westlife for their album Where We Are.\nIn November 2005, he released the critically acclaimed EP Welcome to the Future through Still Waters Recordings.On 17 March 2007, a song he wrote titled \"I Can\", performed by former East 17 singer Brian Harvey, participated in the United Kingdom's national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. He co-wrote the tracks \"Mouth to Mouth\" and \"Porcelain\" with X Factor winner Matt Cardle on his 2013 album Porcelain, as well as being credited with backing vocals and keyboards. After spending a couple of years writing and performing in South West France, he returned to London in 2016 where he now continues to write for various UK and International projects as well as working towards releasing new material as an artist in his own right.\nIn an interview with Headliner Magazine in 2019 (which noted that he \"has a soulful singing voice that inexplicably makes listeners want to cry with happiness\"), he revealed why he had stepped out of the limelight for 22 years, and his intention to release new music: \"There won\u2019t be any: \u2018I love you baby, you drive me crazy,\u2019 or \u2018up in the club\u2019. I think that\u2019s been done enough! I like the songs I can really put my heart and soul into. That\u2019s what makes it soul. It\u2019s those kind of songs when I can stand up and say: \u2018I mean every word of this,\u2019 so hopefully people will get that. It just feels like I\u2019m on the right path again after that massive detour. A 20 year break! I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to lead, I really don\u2019t. But I\u2019m on it, and I\u2019m not getting off it again.\u201d", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Namu My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d", "response": ["* \"They Say\" \u2014 Conner Reeves (1997)"]}, {"page": "Brian Harvey", "response": ["On 17 March 2007, Harvey performed a song entitled \"I Can\" for Making Your Mind Up, the United Kingdom's national final for the Eurovision Song Contest.
