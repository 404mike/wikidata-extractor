The park was left to the town under the will of John Frederick Cheetham along with his house, Eastwood, and his collection of paintings, which now form part of the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery collection. The park is landscaped informally with large areas of woodland. Adjacent to Cheetham's Park lies the Eastwood Nature Reserve. Eastwood was one of the first reserves to be owned by the RSPB. It is managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve is a cut-over, lowland, raised mire SSSI, surrounded by a woodland fringe. Characteristic bog plants include sphagnum mosses, cotton grass and cross-leaved heath. Nine species of dragonfly and damselfly have been recorded on the reserve, along with the green hairstreak butterfly. The steep-sided broad-leaved woodland is bisected by Acres Brook and contains several old mill ponds. The geology is shale and sandstone, with a rich variety of plants and animals typical of woodland habitat on an acid soil. Access is from the A6018 Mottram Road.

The space was turned into a gallery to house the Astley Cheetham Collection, bequeathed in 1932. This collection has grown with gifts and donations throughout the 20th century and is one of the most interesting small regional collections of 15th century Italian paintings. The collection of work by Italian old masters includes 'Portrait of a Young Man' by Alessandro Allori. Also, British art of the 19th and 20th centuries is represented by artists such as John Linnell, Richard Parkes Bonington, George Price Boyce, Burne-Jones, Mark Gertler and Duncan Grant. Aske Hall by J. M. W. Turner is also part of the gallery's collection. Alongside exhibitions of the collection, the gallery also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions by regional artists."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1910\u20131936)", "response": ["*John Frederick Cheetham (1835\u20131916)"]}, {"page": "Stalybridge (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Frederick Cheetham"]}, {"page": "North Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|John Frederick Cheetham || Liberal"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|John Frederick Cheetham"]}, {"page": "John Cheetham (manufacturer)", "response": ["His son John Frederick Cheetham was MP for North Derbyshire and later for Stalybridge."]}, {"page": "United Kingdom by-election records", "response": ["*John Frederick Cheetham was 70 when he won the 1905 Stalybridge by-election for the Liberals.
