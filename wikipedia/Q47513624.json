In 2001, the award was replaced by the Young Sports Personality of the Year, and sprinter Amy Spencer was the first recipient of that award. The only two non-English recipients to win the award are Scottish tennis player Andy Murray, who won in 2004, and British-Japanese skateboarder Sky Brown, who won in 2021, and represents Great Britain whilst living in both Japan and the United States. The only person to win the award more than once is diver Tom Daley, who won the award three times, in 2007, 2009, and 2010, and was nominated to the ten-person shortlist in five successive years (2007\u20132011).

The badge is shield-shaped and made from the same material as the common Blue badge. It is a white badge with a medal shape on the front of it (the round-shaped medal which is blue, but has the white Blue Peter ship on it. The ribbon 'attached' to the medal is made from stripes of blue, white and red.) The child could earn the badge by introducing someone to a new sport, maybe a friend or a brother or sister. Children could apply for the sport badge during the summer months of every year since, with slight changes in the badge's design. The 2014 and 2015 badge had borders added to the design, which were blue and red respectively. To celebrate the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, a competition was launched to design the 2016 sport badge. The sports badge was also awarded in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
