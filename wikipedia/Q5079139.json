The death of Southerton and retirement of other veterans paved the way for new talent in Maurice Read, William Roller, left-arm spinner Edward Barratt and pace bowler Charles Horner to lay a foundation for long-term success in the middle 1880s. With the rapid rise of George Lohmann in 1885, Surrey challenged for the unofficial title of Champion County for the first time in twenty years; then, by winning 32 of 42 matches in 1887, 1888 and 1889, Surrey were first or equal first in the final three years before official County Champions emerged."]}, {"page": "Charles Horner", "response": ["Charles Horner may refer to:", "* Charles Horner (jeweller) (1837\u20131896), English jeweller", "* Charles Horner (cricketer) (1857\u20131925), English cricketer", "* Charles Horner (diplomat) (born 1943), U.S. diplomat"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Charles Horner (1885)"]}]}}
