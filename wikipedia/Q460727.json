It was devised by German mathematician Max Munk and further refined by British aerodynamicist Hermann Glauert and others in the 1920s. The theory idealizes the flow around an airfoil as two-dimensional flow around a thin airfoil.  It can be imagined as addressing an airfoil of zero thickness and infinite wingspan."]}, {"page": "List of Old Edwardians (Sheffield)", "response": ["* Hermann Glauert (1892\u20131934), aerodynamicist, who developed the Prandtl\u2013Glauert transformation"]}, {"page": "List of scientific equations named after people", "response": ["| Prandtl\u2013Glauert equation || Compressible flows || Ludwig Prandtl and Hermann Glauert"]}, {"page": "Prandtl\u2013Glauert transformation", "response": ["Ludwig Prandtl had been teaching this transformation in his lectures for a while, however the first publication was in 1928 by Hermann Glauert.

Glauert was killed in an accident in 1934 and so Douglas was appointed Head of Aerodynamics Department and Bradfield became the Head of Wind Tunnels (more informally known as the small wind tunnel section of the model research department), a role she held for the remainder of the 1930s and throughout World War II."]}, {"page": "Gwen Alston", "response": ["Alston joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough Airfield in 1933, working under Hermann Glauert and supervising the Aero department's spinning tunnel.

Her first publication in her early career at Farnborough was on theoretical streamlines for the flow over an aerofoil. In 1919 she went to study at Bryn Mawr for a year and then undertook postgraduate studies in aeronautics at Cambridge. In August 1922 she published her paper 'On the use of very small pitot-tubes for measuring wind velocity' in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. A Pitot tube is a slender tube with two holes used to calculate speed through the air or water, used by both ships and aeroplanes. Barker was the first researcher to demonstrate that the difference between the Pitot tube's reading and the static pressure is proportional to the flow speed rather than to its square. In the same year she returned to the RAE, and became engaged to, and later married, the aerodynamicist Hermann Glauert, Principal Scientific Officer at the RAE.", "She was married to Hermann Glauert, who died in 1934. They had three children: Michael, and twins Audrey and Richard. Muriel Glauert died in 1949 and was buried alongside her husband."]}]}}
