The death of her sister in 2012 terminated the abeyance in favour of the Countess, who succeeded in the baronies at that point. Since her own death in 2013, the titles are in abeyance once more.\nOn 15 November 1952, Lady Diana married Robert Miller (d. 1990, in an automobile accident in Harare) and they had two daughters - co-heiresses to the baronies:\n\nHon. Marcia Anne - adopted name: Anthea Lycett (born 21 June 1954)\nHon. Beatrix Diana (born 23 August 1955).When pregnant with Marcia, Lady Diana put her baby for adoption, which was agreed and accepted by Moira Lycett and her husband Michael, who changed her name to Anthea. In August 1958 Moira and Anthea were flying to London in a Central African Airways Viscount, which crashed near Benghazi. Moira was killed and Anthea injured. Lady Diana's family sought to reclaim the child to the exclusion of the adopted father, who refused. He subsequently remarried to the child's aunt, Lady Wendy. Beatrix Diana married in 1991 Simon Armstrong, son of C. W. Armstrong who have two sons.", "link_mentions": {}}}
