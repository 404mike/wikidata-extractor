It was here that the Chartist leader Henry Vincent, who had sought the right of all men to vote in parliamentary elections, was imprisoned before being tried at the assizes. Vincent was convicted, but the unpopularity of the verdict led to protests that eventually led to miners being killed in a clash with the military at Newport on 4 November 1839. John Frost was arrested in Newport shortly after the riot, followed by other leaders of the group.  A Special Commission opened at Shire Hall on 10 December 1839, and an appointed Grand Jury considered what charges to bring against them. The Grand Jury included Lord Granville Somerset, brother of the Duke of Beaufort; John Etherington Welch Rolls; Octavius Morgan; and four Members of Parliament, Joseph Bailey, William Addams Williams, Reginald James Blewitt, and Sir Benjamin Hall.   Frost, William Jones, Zephaniah Williams and five others were duly charged with high treason, and their trial began on 31 December.  It has been described as \"one of the most important treason trials in the annals of British law\".  The judges were the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Nicholas Tindal; Sir James Parke; and Sir John Williams, who was notorious for sentencing the Tolpuddle Martyrs to transportation in 1834.  Counsel for the Crown was the Attorney General, Sir John Campbell; Frost's counsel was Sir Frederick Pollock."]}, {"page": "Liverpool ministry", "response": ["| Lord Granville Somerset"]}, {"page": "Granville Somerset", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lord Granville Somerset"]}, {"page": "Alexander Milne (civil servant)", "response": ["Milne first became a commissioner on 14 August 1834 when William IV appointed him a \"Commissioner of His Majesty's Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, and Buildings\".
