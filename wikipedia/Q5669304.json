In his time at Swansea he filled multiple roles, as player, physio, coach, trainer, assistant manager and manager. As a player, he made 421 appearances for Swansea Town scored 72 goals, and was also capped by Wales.He left to join Merthyr Tydfil in 1964, but returned to Swansea as a coach in 1967, and between 1975 and 1978 was Swansea's manager.Despite promising performances at the start of the 1977\u201378 season, Griffiths resigned as manager, doubting his ability to take the club any further. He worked as John Toshack's assistant until his death on 25 April 1978, when he suffered a heart attack prior to the win against Scunthorpe United which the team won 3\u20131.  The following Saturday they beat Halifax Town 2-0 and clinched promotion to the Third Division.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ivor Allchurch", "response": ["Allchurch was persuaded to remain at the club, encouraged by Sykes and McCandless' belief in a number of local youth players making their way through the Swans setup, including Cliff Jones, Harry Griffiths and Allchurch's brother Len. In September 1952, Swansea rejected a bid of \u00a330,000 from Arsenal for Allchurch, the bid just \u00a35,000 below the British record transfer fee that Sheffield Wednesday had paid for Jackie Sewell a year previously. He finished the 1952\u201353 season as the club's second highest top scorer with 15 goals, including his first career hattrick during a 3\u20132 victory over Brentford on 6 April 1953. The Swans attacking trio of Allchurch, Medwin and Griffiths accounted for more than half of the club's league goals during the season."]}, {"page": "John Toshack", "response": ["Having secured his release from his contract at Liverpool, Toshack looked to move into management and approached his former club Cardiff City over a coaching position but was rejected by manager Jimmy Andrews who questioned his qualifications for the role. Toshack instead received a phone call from Swansea City chairman Malcolm Struel and was invited to a meeting at the club. Following this, he was appointed player-manager of Fourth Division club Swansea on 1 March 1978, becoming the youngest manager in the Football League at the age of 29. Succeeding Harry Griffiths who stepped down to become his assistant, Toshack's appointment was seen as a significant coup for Swansea and the crowd for his first match in charge, a 3\u20133 draw with Watford, more than doubled from the club's previous home match with over 15,000 in attendance."]}, {"page": "1978 in Wales", "response": ["*25 April - Harry Griffiths, footballer and manager, 47"]}, {"page": "April 1978", "response": ["**Harry Griffiths, Welsh footballer and manager (b. 1931)"]}, {"page": "1931 in Wales", "response": ["*4 January - Harry Griffiths, footballer (died 1978)"]}, {"page": "Alan Curtis (footballer)", "response": ["Despite being retained by Gregg, Curtis had to work as a builder's apprentice during the summer of 1973 to supplement his low income. Despite the arrival of John Charles as a coach and Herbie Way's promotion to player-coach, Gregg continued the physical style of football favoured by Bentley that did not suit Curtis well. Regardless of being ill-suited to this approach Curtis established himself as a first-team regular and made 40 appearances in the 1973\u201374 season. Gregg left Swansea midway through the 1974\u201375 campaign, and new manager Harry Griffiths insisted on playing a pass-and-move style of football. Initial results were poor, and the club had to apply for re-election after finishing 22nd at the end of the campaign."]}, {"page": "South Wales derby", "response": ["Before the 1960s the rivalry was a typically a friendly one and many fans held no animosity towards their Welsh rivals. In the area between the two cities, some fans supported both teams and matches between the sides in the post-war decade often saw opposing fans standing alongside each other on the terraces. The 1960s saw that change as football culture became more aggressive and local rivalries became more important than shared regional identities. The earliest trouble of note between the two teams occurred in February 1960 during a Welsh Cup sixth round tie. Cardiff were due to play a league match two days later and approached the Football Association of Wales (FAW) to postpone the match. The request was denied and in response, Cardiff manager Bill Jones named a reserve side for the fixture. Despite fielding a weakened team, Cardiff went on to win the tie 2\u20131 in a match that saw several confrontations. Cardiff's Colin Hudson was sent off for a foul with ten minutes remaining before his teammate Steve Mokone and Swansea's Harry Griffiths were also dismissed after wrestling each other to the ground and throwing mud in retaliation. The FAW subsequently fined Cardiff \u00a3350 for fielding a weakened side in the competition and warned the club against doing so again in future. Swansea historian Gwyn Rees has stated that fans' animosity began to increase in the late 1960s, citing the 1969 Welsh Cup final as a turning point. The match was the first derby that saw notable issues of violence between the two sets of supporters. At the end of the 1969\u201370 season, Swansea Town changed its name to Swansea City after the area was granted city status."]}]}}
