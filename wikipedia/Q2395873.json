Towards the end of his playing career, Hughes took on coaching responsibilities, and was appointed manager of Falkirk in 2003 (initially as co-manager with Owen Coyle). Hughes guided the club to promotion to the Scottish Premier League and a Scottish Cup Final during his time in charge. He eventually left Falkirk to take up the managerial role at Hibernian in 2009, but left by mutual consent after sixteen months.\nHughes was appointed manager of Livingston in February 2012, but left in November to take over at English club Hartlepool United. He departed Hartlepool in May 2013 after being unable to prevent their relegation to League Two. Hughes was appointed manager of Inverness Caledonian Thistle in December 2013. He led the club to their first major silverware with the Scottish Cup in May 2015, and their first foray into European football, before he left in May 2016. Hughes then had a brief stint with Raith Rovers, which ended in them being relegated to Scottish League One.

Five minutes before the end of the second leg at Anfield, Bobby Lennox appeared to score a goal that would have put Celtic through on the away goals rule, but it was controversially disallowed for offside. Celtic were involved in a tight Scottish league championship race with Rangers, who they also played in the 1966 Scottish Cup Final. The final was lost after a replay, to a goal by Kai Johansen.
