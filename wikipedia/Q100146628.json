As a member of the group, she played Jean Mutrie as female lead in The Gorbals Story, a successful play by Robert McLeish which opened in 1946 at the Queen's Theatre, Gallowgate and then toured the UK, including a residence at London's Garrick Theatre in 1948. Thomson reprised the role in the film version (1950). This was her screen debut and the cast included Russell Hunter, who became her first husband.She specialised in the stage through the 1950s until her TV debut on 1 January 1960.
