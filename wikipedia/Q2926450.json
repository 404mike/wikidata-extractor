In the course of his investigation he encounters Jeanne Gardella (Mathilda May), the wife of the businessman Antoine Gardella (Jacques Dutronc), a member of organized crime, and the son of the murdered couple. Antoine Gardella and his wife Jeanne live harmoniously, but Jeanne Gardella was forced by Thurson (Vernon Dobtcheff), a dubious agent of Interpol to her \"role as wife\" in the context of an undercover action against the European organized crime. Despite his criminal background, Jeanne loves her husband. Thurson also urges Christophe Vade to investigate Gardella and his wife in connection with the murder of those parents, and to get an additional pressure medium to gouge Jeanne Gardella to continue that farce. Thurson does not explain that plan either to inspector Vade or Jeanne Gardella, who fell in love, finally tolerated by Antoine Gardella who accepts that his wife was forced to that undercover action by Thurson. Tightly interwoven with the main story, the subplot plays in the milieu of the Swiss city of Z\u00fcrich, and the advances of the brutal and corrupt city police officer Scatamacchia (Hans Heinz Moser) against a hostess allow a very personal view on Scandurat (Bruce Myers), Gardella's business partner and close friend. Finally, Vadella is forced to kill Vade and Jeanne, but refuses and choices suicide, to meet the unwritten rules within the organized crime.", "* Bruce Myers as Scandurat "]}, {"page": "Let There Be Light (1998 film)", "response": ["* Bruce Myers as The Rabbi"]}, {"page": "2020 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Bruce Myers, 77\u201378, actor (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Let There Be Light), comedian, and director."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2020", "response": ["*Bruce Myers, 78, British actor (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Let There Be Light), comedian, and director, COVID-19.E\u2019 morto per coronavirus l\u2019attore Bruce Myers, per sette anni insegnante alla Scuola di recitazione del Teatro Stabile "]}, {"page": "List of deaths due to COVID-19", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Bruce Myers"]}, {"page": "Bruce Myers", "response": ["Bruce Myers may refer to:", "*Bruce Myers (actor) (1942\u20132020), British actor, comedian and director", "*Bruce Myers (bishop) (born 1972), Canadian bishop"]}, {"page": "Gyula Shakespeare Festival", "response": ["2009 \u2013 the V Shakespeare Festival: this year\u2019s Festival opened with a performance entitled \u201cLove is My Sin\u201d, in which famous actors Natasha Perry and Bruce Myers performed Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets.
