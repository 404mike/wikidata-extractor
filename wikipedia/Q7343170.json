The first substantive Principal was Walter Adams, who served from 1955 until 1966 and was later Director of the London School of Economics (he was knighted in 1970). Adams was succeeded by Terence Miller, who lasted a mere two years as his racially progressive views brought him into conflict with the Rhodesian government. His successor, Scottish theologian Robert Craig, who later was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, served from 1969 to 1980. Leonard J. Lewis served as Principal for around a year during the transition to Zimbabwe's independence. He was succeeded in 1981 by law professor Walter Kamba, who became Vice-Chancellor, the post created to replace that of Principal. Like Miller, Kamba clashed with the government and announced his resignation at the 1992 graduation ceremony, in a speech that cited government interference in the university and threats to academic freedom. He was succeeded by Gordon Chavunduka until 1996, and then by Graham Hill from 1997 to 2002. Levi Nyagura, the longest-serving Vice-Chancellor, held the office from 2003 to 2018, when he was suspended on charges that he unprocedurally awarded a PhD degree to former First Lady Grace Mugabe. President Emmerson Mnangagwa appointed agricultural engineering professor Paul Mapfumo as acting Vice-Chancellor in August 2018."]}, {"page": "List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland", "response": ["*1986 Robert Craig CBE (Jerusalem (Emeritus))"]}, {"page": "Bell Baxter High School", "response": ["* The Very Reverend Professor Robert Craig CBE former Moderator of the Church of Scotland "]}, {"page": "Robert Craig", "response": ["*Robert Craig (theologian) (1917\u20131995), academic and church leader", "*Robert Craig (representative) (1792\u20131852), U.S. Representative from Virginia", "*Robert Craig (Medal of Honor) (1919\u20131943), Scottish-born U.S. Army officer awarded the Medal of Honor for his  service on Sicily"]}]}}
