Her sculptures were exhibited in Italy, France and the United Kingdom. Some of her pieces: Head (c.1980), Reclining Figure (c.1980) and La Joie de Vivre (1988) were featured, for sale, in the Wolseley Fine Arts Catalogue of Modern and Contemporary Sculpture. In 2013, some of her previously unseen works were exhibited at the Glyndebourne Festival alongside the work of Sean Henry and Michael Craig-Martin. She was described by Roy Oppenheim as \"one of the most exciting sculptors of our time\". An image of Campavias, taken by Ida Kar is held in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery."]}]}}
