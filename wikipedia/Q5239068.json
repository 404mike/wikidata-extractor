In March 1990 he was sold on to Peterborough United for \u00a340,000, and helped the club to two successive promotions into the Second Division. He later played for Kettering Town, Ponsonby (in New Zealand), Boston United, and King's Lynn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darren Beckford", "response": ["He scored his first hat-trick for the club on 2 April 1988, during a 5\u20130 demolition of Doncaster Rovers. Throughout 1987\u201388 he was the club's top scorer with ten goals, along with David Riley. That season Vale won every game in which Beckford made it onto the score sheet. He was once again top scorer in 1988\u201389, this time bagging 23 goals as the club won promotion to the Second Division via the play-offs. On 19 September, he scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20130 home win over Chesterfield. On 25 March, he scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20131 victory over Notts County. On 25 May, he scored a hat-trick as Vale beat Preston North End 3\u20131 in the play-off semi-final second leg, giving them a 4\u20132 aggregate victory. He also provided the crucial second goal of the 1989 final, flicking on a corner for Robbie Earle to knock into the net. He adapted well to tougher opposition in the 1989\u201390 season. He managed 21 goals to become the club's top scorer yet again. With 23 goals in 1990\u201391, he became the club's top scorer for the fourth consecutive season. He managed to bag a hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers, and also found the net against former club Manchester City in the FA Cup."]}, {"page": "List of Port Vale F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Darren BeckfordDavid Riley"]}, {"page": "David Sidney Riley", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Riley (footballer)"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The 1987\u201388 season was Port Vale's 76th season of football in the English Football League, and second successive (17th overall) season in the Third Division. John Rudge's side started the season well, but then suffered following the sale of star striker Andy Jones. Just as Rudge seemed to be struggling, the Vale earned a memorable 2\u20131 victory over top-flight Tottenham Hotspur at Vale Park in the FA Cup Fourth Round. They exited the competition at the next stage at the hands of Watford, following a replay. Vale's league form also improved, as they finished in eleventh place, helped by midfielders Ray Walker and Robbie Earle, defenders Phil Sproson and Bob Hazell, and goalkeeper Mark Grew. Darren Beckford and David Riley were joint-top-scorers with ten goals each. Vale exited the League Cup and the Associate Members' Cup at the First Round.", "The season began with Andy Jones scoring all four goals in his 100th appearance for the club, to beat Aldershot 4\u20132. With Pearson performing poorly, Darren Hughes was signed from Brighton & Hove Albion for a \u00a310,000 fee. Paul Smith was also offloaded to Lincoln City for \u00a340,000. Vale then won three consecutive games to go top of the table. After goal machine Andy Jones was sold to First Division Charlton Athletic for \u00a3350,000 \u2013 a sale Rudge described as like 'cutting off my right arm' \u2013 Vale slid down the table. Alex Williams was also forced to retire with a back injury, leading to the return of a fit again Mark Grew in goal. More injuries came as Chris Banks had his nose broken after a reserve match at Barnsley when he was attacked by a gang of youths whilst waiting at a fish and chip shop. Alan Webb then suffered second degree burns at Preston North End's plastic pitch at Deepdale. The next month Rudge tried to replace Jones when he signed David Riley from Nottingham Forest for \u00a320,000. Despite a good start Riley soon entered a goal drought, as Vale went twelve league games without a win (including eight defeats). Robbie Earle missed much of this period with a hernia injury. In November Kevin Steggles was signed from West Bromwich Albion for 'a small fee' to replace the still-injured Webb. More signings were made with former England international Peter Barnes arriving on loan from Manchester City, and 'hard-working' Simon Mills purchased from York City for \u00a335,000.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| David Riley", "|\u2013||FW||||David Riley||8||1||0||1||10", "| October 1987 || FW ||  || David Riley || Nottingham Forest || \u00a320,000 || "]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with a 4\u20132 win over Preston North End on a plastic pitch at Deepdale. David Riley \"discussed a transfer\", but remained at the club despite being unhappy at starting the season from the bench. A weak defensive performance then cost them at home to Chester City, though Rudge was happy with the performance of Simon Mills, a midfielder who was learning a new position at right-back. A disciplined performance was enough to win a point away at Bury, with goalkeeper Mark Grew in impressive form. With Atkinson injured and Steve Harper out of form, Rudge tried unsuccessfully to bring in Liverpool's Steve Staunton and Bournemouth's Mark O'Connor on loan. The campaign though kicked into gear with \"a stunningly ruthless\" 6\u20131 thrashing of \"a by no means inadequate\" Cardiff City. They followed this up with a 5\u20130 mauling of a \"dreadful\" Chesterfield \u2013 Darren Beckford claiming a hat-trick \u2013 and moved to the top of the table.

With Atkinson injured, John Jeffers was taken on loan from Liverpool, though David Riley's form kept Jeffers on the bench. On 17 December, Vale overcame Reading 3\u20130 to hit second in the table. On Boxing day, Vale recorded a 1\u20130 win at Mansfield Town despite having Ray Walker sent off. They then missed the chance to end the calendar year on top of the table after falling to a 1\u20130 loss at relegation fodder Gillingham. Before the year was out, Paul Millar was signed from Irish club Portadown for \u00a320,000, but severely damaged his knee ligaments in one of his early training sessions.

This moved Vale to within three points of the play-offs. A poor March dragged them down the table though, as the stadium's capacity was again reduced and the police bill spiralled. In April, Rudge sold David Riley to Peterborough United for \u00a340,000, whilst \u00a320,000 was spent bringing in Gary McKinstry from Portadown. The club's play-off dreams were killed off by a 2\u20131 defeat from Newcastle United, after which only two points were won from the final four games. Despite this the supporters held popular player Neil Aspin aloft following the team's final home game (a 2\u20131 defeat to Sunderland).
