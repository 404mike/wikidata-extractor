On 12 June 1932 the Reverend Richard Cattell arrived to officiate at the evening service in Stiffkey. He had just begun when Davidson entered the church and attempted to seize the Bible. The two priests wrestled with the book for some seconds before Cattell yielded, telling the congregation: \"As nothing short of force will prevent Mr Davidson from taking part, I can see nothing left to do but to withdraw.\"Cullen, p. 167 The crowds of reporters and sightseers at weekends led the Archdeacon of Lynn to issue a statement deploring the \"media circus\" and asking that \"the full spirit of worship\" be restored to Sunday services.Tucker, pp. 101\u201303"]}]}}
