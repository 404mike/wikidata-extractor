In June 2015, ownership of the club was taken up by a new consortium made up of 10 local business people.

After a 2\u20131 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday, McCormick lost his spot to the returning Larrieu, who played in a dozen games before falling ill to testicular cancer again, seeing McCormick become first choice once again. He received his first red card of his career in the 71st minute of a 1\u20130 defeat away to Scunthorpe United, for handling the ball outside his area. Defender Lee Hodges took over goalkeeping duties for the rest of the game, and emergency-loan signing Rab Douglas played the next game, before McCormick re-gained his place in the team, as Argyle went on to finish 10th in the Championship. A 1\u20130 defeat away to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 4 May 2008 would prove to be his final game for over four years.

Joining him in Berkshire was Barnet teammate Lee Hodges. Primus partnered Keith McPherson in defence but Reading started the season poorly with just one point from the first six games despite Primus saying \"I played well from the word go\". Due to an injury crisis, Reading lost their penultimate league match at Nottingham Forest and were relegated from Division One. This was Primus' first experience of relegation.

Steve Tully was relieved of his managerial duties and replaced by Lee Hodges, who had only left the club three years prior.", "The club's lack of consistency was prominent again in the 2018\u201319 season, where after just two games long-serving manager Lee Hodges resigned. The club poached Taunton Town manager Leigh Robinson and his assistant Michael Meaker, but they were both sacked in March 2019, with the club 19th in the league. Paul Wilkinson was named caretaker-manager but couldn't save the club, who eventually finished 20th and were relegated to the Southern League.
