The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical and numerical operations, while the analog component often serves as a solver of differential equations and other mathematically complex equations. The first desktop hybrid computing system was the Hycomp 250, released by Packard Bell in 1961. Another early example was the HYDAC 2400, an integrated hybrid computer released by EAI in 1963. In the 1980s,  Marconi Space and Defense Systems Limited (under Peggy Hodges) developed their \"Starglow Hybrid Computer\", which consisted of three EAI 8812 analog computers linked to an EAI 8100 digital computer, the latter also being linked to an SEL 3200 digital computer. Late in the 20th century, hybrids dwindled with the increasing capabilities of digital computers including digital signal processors.The Analogue Alternative, the Electronic Analog Computer in Britain and the USA, 1930-1975, by James S Small"]}, {"page": "Whitney Straight", "response": ["In 1967, he donated the Whitney Straight Award to the Royal Aeronautical Society to recognise the achievement and status of women in aviation.[Flight International, 22 February 1968] The award consisted of a cheque and a sculpture by Barbara Hepworth.

It was still a period when a talented person could rise from the technician ranks without a degree, as defence engineer Joan Lavender was able to do at DeHavillands and engineering software designer Judy Butland was able to do at Manchester University and then with her own software business. The defence industry, aviation and the emerging computer hardware and software industries were areas when many women found careers at that time. Examples include Elizabeth Killick, WES presidents Elizabeth Laverick and Peggy Hodges and the founder of the UK's first independent commercial software company, Dina St Johnston."]}, {"page": "International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists", "response": ["The third International Conference of Women Engineers and Scientists was held in Turin, Italy ( 30 August - 5 September 1971), organised by Dr Anna Amour and AIDIA (the Italian Association for Women in Engineering and Architecture), and supported by the late Dr. Emma Strada.
