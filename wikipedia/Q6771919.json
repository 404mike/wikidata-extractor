He trialled with Everton in May 2002, and played in a friendly against Falkirk in the Alex Scott Memorial Trophy, keeping a clean sheet. He revealed he was interested in a move to Everton, and due to Fettis' good form for York, he decided to pursue a move. After his contract expired on 30 June 2002, Howarth joined Wolves for a second trial in July for a two-week period. After playing in Wolves' opening pre-season friendly against Morecambe, he was invited to join them for their pre-season tour of Portugal. Despite being out of contract at York, the club was entitled a fee as he was under 24 years of age, but a bid of \u00a360,000 from Wolves was rejected. He was recalled by York to take part in a pre-season friendly against Sunderland, although he refused to participate. Howarth told Dolan he did not want to play for the club, as any potential injury could have ended his proposed transfer. His proposed move to Wolves continued until August 2002, and late that month he trained with Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. He played in a practice match for Tottenham, but after they failed to follow up their interest in him Wolves made a bid to sign him on loan, which York rejected. After Marlon Beresford left York, and Howarth's proposed moves elsewhere fell through, he re-signed for the club in September 2002 on a week-to-week contract. Despite this, he spent two days on trial with Premier League club Newcastle United in late September 2002. Howarth's first appearance of 2002\u201303 came in a 4\u20133 away defeat to Lincoln City on 22 October 2002 in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round, after Fettis was rested due to injury."]}, {"page": "Dean Brill", "response": ["With regular goalkeeper Marlon Beresford unavailable, Brill began 2005\u201306 as the number one goalkeeper, impressing against newly relegated Crystal Palace during a 2\u20131 victory at Selhurst Park on the opening day of the season."]}, {"page": "Lincoln Christ's Hospital School", "response": ["*Marlon Beresford (born 1969), professional footballer with Middlesbrough F.C., Burnley F.C. and Luton Town F.C.: 1982\u201386"]}, {"page": "Danny Alcock", "response": ["He joined Barnsley in August 2003.
