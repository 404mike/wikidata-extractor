He commented that the cuisines of many countries were covered, but the main ones were French, Greek, Turkish and Arab. In The New York Times Mimi Sheraton wrote that the book was a \"large, handsome volume [with] helpful shopping, storing and cooking information on all the vegetables included in recipes, and the range of dishes is worldwide if strongest on European specialties\". Sheraton remarked on the \"especially good lentil recipes, wonderful fragrant and bracing soups, and intriguing preparations for lesserknown vegetables such as chayote squash, Jerusalem artichokes and hop shoots\". Wilshaw, reviewing the paperback edition for The Guardian, praised Grigson's \"warm and erudite style\u00a0... an encyclopaedic account of vegetables, their history and their place in modern kitchens\".

Grigson did not believe that anything is truly original in recipes, and happily included those of other writers in her books, being careful to acknowledge her sources\u2014\"There's nothing new about intellectual honesty\". Her influences were not exclusively European: among those she credited in her Fish Cookery (1973) were Claudia Roden's A Book of Middle Eastern Food, Mary Lamb's New Orleans Cuisine and James Beard's Delights and Prejudices. Nevertheless, Fish Cookery is, of Grigson's books, the one most focused on the British cook, because, as she observes, the same edible birds and quadrupeds are found in many parts of the world, but species of fish are generally more confined to particular areas. Even given that limitation, Grigson urges her British readers to be more adventurous in their choice of fresh fish. She points out that there are more than fifty species native to British waters, not including shellfish or freshwater fish, and she urges cooks to venture beyond \"cod and plaice, overcooked and coated with greasy batter\"."]}, {"page": "Mediterranean cuisine", "response": ["Levantine cuisine is the cooking of the Levant (including the Middle Eastern Mediterranean coast, east of Egypt).
