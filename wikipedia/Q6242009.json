This proved his undoing at the 1868 General Election when he was defeated in a four-cornered contest for the two seats. On the one hand, Edward Sartoris, a radical Liberal actively sought the support of both the radical wing of the Liberal Party and the powerful nonconformist interest. The Conservatives, meanwhile, fielded both John Jones (brother of the previous member, David Jones, who stood down) and Henry Puxley, a landowner with extensive interests in Ireland. There was much focus during the campaign upon disestablishment of the Church of England in Ireland and Pugh's views were regarded as vague, thus alienating both traditional Conservatives who supported Jones and Puxley, and the more radical Liberals who were supported Sartoris. Pugh, who had been returned unopposed at previous elections, fought a lacklustre campaign, which was chiefly brought to life by the active support of Pugh's close friend, W.R.H. Powell. Although the result was determined to a great extent by a significant increase in the number of industrial workers who were enfranchised, Pugh's defeat was later ascribed to his 'hazy and indefinite opinions'. He was said to have accepted his defeat with 'good humour' but was thereafter regarded as a supporter of Gladstone."]}, {"page": "John Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Jones (Carmarthenshire MP)"]}, {"page": "1890 East Carmarthenshire by-election", "response": ["It may well have been that popular momentum would have been behind Gwilym Evans, not least because of his well-known reputation as producer of his famous 'Quinine Bitters'. However, a number of questions were raised about his candidature. It was stated that he owned half a dozen public houses in the constituency. There were claims that he had publicly supported a Conservative candidate, John Jones, at the General Election of 1880. Evans countered by giving his own full version of the episode and stating that Jones had assisted him in gaining a public office. However, more recently it was stated that Evans had opposed the Association in 1886 and taken up a position akin to a Liberal Unionist over Irish Home Rule."]}]}}
