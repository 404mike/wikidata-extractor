Mary had inherited the Llysdulas estate on Anglesey from her uncle, including Parys Mountain, which later became the largest copper mine in Europe and gained the Hughes family great wealth. The Kinmel estate in Denbighshire was acquired by Reverend Edward Hughes in 1786.William Lewis Hughes was returned to parliament as one of two representatives for Wallingford in 1802, a seat he held until 1831. The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Dinorben, of Kinmel in the County of Denbigh. He was also a philanthropist and notably founded a free school for local girls at Kinmel.Lord Dinorben died in February 1852, aged 84, and was succeeded in the barony by his younger but only surviving son, William.

Gertrude, whose husband had become rich from copper mining on Anglesey at Parys Mountain, also rebuilt the main house of Llys Dulas in the mid-1850s; it was demolished in 1976 after becoming derelict. Her daughter and heiress Gwyn Gertrude Hughes laid the foundation stone on 14 September 1854, using a silver trowel and ebony mallet.  A box placed underneath the stone contained a Bible, a prayer book, a document with details of the event and an example of every British coin minted in that year. Those present were addressed in Welsh by the clergyman James Williams and in English by the curate of the parish, Morris Williams (more commonly known by his bardic name \"Nicander\").

He employed an architect to carry out some further restoration work, although the details are unknown.  The church was in need of further repair by the middle of the 19th century, and the congregation needed a larger building.  A new church was therefore built between 1854 and 1856 about two-thirds of a mile (1.1\u00a0km) away, financed largely by the widow of William Hughes, 1st Baron Dinorben (the son of Edward Hughes).
