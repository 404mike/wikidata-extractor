Hawkshaw worked extensively for the KPM production music company in the 1950s to the 1970s, composing and recording many stock tracks that have been used extensively in film and TV. \nHe was the composer of a number of theme tunes including Grange Hill (originally library music recorded in Munich known as \"Chicken Man\") and Countdown. In addition, he was an arranger and pianist, and in the United States with the studio group Love De-Luxe scored a number 1 single on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart with \"Here Comes That Sound Again\" in 1979. His song \"Charlie\" is heard on Just for Laughs Gags. \nHe was the father of singer-songwriter Kirsty Hawkshaw (a member of the dance music group Opus III from 1991 to 1995) and also worked with artists such as Ti\u00ebsto, Delerium, BT, Seba and Paradox.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 27", "response": ["*1937 \u2013 Alan Hawkshaw, English keyboard player and songwriter "]}, {"page": "Countdown (game show)", "response": ["Though the style and colour scheme of the set have changed many times (and the show itself moved to Manchester, after more than 25 years in Leeds), the clock has always provided the centrepiece and, like the clock music composed by Alan Hawkshaw, is an enduring and well-recognised feature of Countdown.
