He began his teaching career at Croydon School of Art, later teaching at the Royal College of Art from 1948 to 1975, where his students included Sandra Blow. Initially influenced by Walter Sickert, the Camden Town Group, and the portraiture of the Euston Road School, his work often has a narrative quality, with elements of humour and gentle satire. As one of the thirty eight\nOfficial War Artists in Britain in the Second World War, between 1942-44, Spear was commissioned  by the War Artists' Advisory Committee, under the chairmanship of Kenneth Clark, given a short-term contract, and producing several works for the scheme.Because he used a wheelchair due to childhood polio, much of his work concerned his immediate surroundings. He rendered the citizens of Hammersmith relaxing in and around the local pubs, theatres and shops.  In 1980, a retrospective of Spear's work was held at the Royal Academy in London.\nSpear's paintings are held in important public collections in the United Kingdom, including the Tate Gallery Collection, Arts Council England, National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War Museum, Government Art Collection and the Royal Academy of Arts, and worldwide. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1979. Spear was the father of musician Roger Ruskin Spear.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1942 in art", "response": ["* Ruskin Spear \u2013 We Can Take It"]}, {"page": "English art", "response": ["Notable English artists of the mid-20th century and after include: Graham Sutherland (1903\u20131980); Carel Weight (1908\u20131997); Ruskin Spear (1911\u20131990); pop art pioneers Richard Hamilton (1922\u20132011), Peter Blake (b. 1932), and David Hockney (b. 1937); and op art exemplar Bridget Riley (b. 1931).", "File:Patients waiting Outside a First Aid Post in a Factory Art.IWMARTLD2683.jpg|Ruskin Spear's Patients waiting Outside a First Aid Post in a Factory; 1942."]}, {"page": "John Redcliffe-Maud, Baron Redcliffe-Maud", "response": ["He retired as Master of University College in 1976, to be succeeded by the leading lawyer Lord Goodman.

Shortly afterwards Spoons secured the band their first regular pub gig at The Kensington in Notting Hill, where they were noticed by \"Big\" Sid Nicholls who would soon join them as second banjo-player. Big Sid in turn introduced Roger Ruskin Spear (son of the British artist Ruskin Spear) to the band. With his interest in sculpture and the manufacture of early electronic gadgets, objets d'art, and sound-making systems, and having already recently played in a one-off impromptu scratch band with Slater and Innes, Spear also soon became a member of the Bonzos. From his own defunct band The Jungle Orchestra, Spear brought with him trumpeter Leon \"Lenny\" Williams to replace the departing Wilkes.", "In November The Bonzos released their second album The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse (the title being a euphemism for an outside toilet), which showcased a marked change in musical direction from Gorilla. After an introductory series of straight-faced street interviews with bewildered pedestrians (conducted by current bassist Joel Druckman and featuring the public's reactions to Vivian Stanshall cavorting about wearing only his underpants, shoes and a papier-mache rabbit head) self-proclaimed 'breezy opener' \"We Are Normal\" soon launches itself towards a faintly terrifying Zappa-esque psychedelic crescendo. Elsewhere, \"Can Blue Men Sing the Whites?\" rather savagely teases some of the heavy-hitters of the then highly-fashionable British Blues Boom against a reasonably-authentic Brit-blues musical backdrop of its own. Other songs such as \"Postcard\" and \"My Pink Half of the Drainpipe\" skewer parochial suburban British pastimes and attitudes, while the anarchic \"Trouser Press\" \u2014 featuring a 'solo' by Roger Ruskin Spear on a genuine trouser press he had had fitted with a pickup \u2013 later gave its name to the American anglophile rock magazine Trouser Press. 1920s-style croon-along \"Hello Mabel\" (complete with musical flock of sheep) is the only real reminder of The Bonzos' original musical style, while \"Eleven Moustachioed Daughters\", Stanshall's darkly tribal homage to Screamin' Jay Hawkins' \"Feast of the Mau-Mau\", closes the LP in an unexpectedly nightmarish manner.", "It was at this point the stress of managing the group's affairs, while simultaneously writing half of their material and performing front of stage, began to take a serious toll on Stanshall's physical and mental health. Nevertheless, he and the others opted to embark upon a second American tour during September. Innes said that when the band picked him up at his house to drive to the airport, Stanshall answered the door with his head completely shaved, which gave him a startled, almost frightened look. True to bad form, the trip was cut short after Roger Ruskin Spear suffered a personal family tragedy and shockingly no-one from the UK office saw fit to inform him or the others about it until well after the event. An understandably enraged Spear immediately abandoned the tour and returned to the UK. Initially the band attempted to fulfill the remaining dates without him, but the tour really began to derail after a rancorous press interview where Stanshall and Innes complained about recent events and the general lack of support and promotion from their record company. Their candour only led to the band and Liberty Records becoming further alienated from each other. When Stanshall also began displaying signs of a complete nervous collapse under the strain of his duties as front man and manager, he and the band quickly decided to cut the tour short at great expense to their future ambitions. As a collective, they would never return to America.", "While the group formally disbanded in 1970, their record company compelled them to reunite in late 1971 to fulfil a contractual obligation and record a final album.  Titled Let's Make Up and Be Friendly, the album was released in 1972.  The edition of the Bonzo Dog Band that made the Friendly LP featured only Stanshall, Innes and bassist Dennis Cowan from the \"classic\" earlier line-ups, although Roger Ruskin Spear appears on one track, and \"Legs\" Larry Smith on two.

There were also a number of special guests attempting with various degrees of success to be Vivian Stanshall, one of two members of the band not still living (the other being bass player Dennis Cowan).  The various Stanshall impersonators included Stephen Fry, Ade Edmondson, Phill Jupitus and Paul Merton (who needed to read the words to \"Monster Mash\" from cue cards at the show).
