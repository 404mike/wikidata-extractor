His brother Max is also a judoka who has represented Great Britain internationally. Elliot took up the sport during his childhood and competed for Team GB at the 2004 European Cadet Judo Championships in Rotterdam as an able-bodied athlete. After suffering rapid deterioration in his eyesight, he was diagnosed with keratoconus: he underwent emergency surgery in 2017 which prevented a complete loss of sight but his vision had declined to the point where he was unable to compete as an able-bodied judoka and had to give up his job teaching judo in schools. However he subsequently underwent testing to find out whether he could compete as a visually impaired competitor, and received a B3 classification, enabling him to continue full-time training at the GB Judo Centre of Excellence with his father as his coach."]}]}}
