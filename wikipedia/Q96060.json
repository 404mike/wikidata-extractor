Born to a wealthy family in Munich, he moved to London in 1900 to train as a financier, but took up photography and rapidly achieved great success.\nHe was the only son of a prominent banker, and was educated in the finest schools of Munich, Paris and Vienna. Upon leaving school he served apprenticeships in German banks for ten years, before accepting a position with the Shanghai Banking Corporation. He never arrived in China. The first leg of his journey took him to England where he met an old school friend. Hopp\u00e9 married his old school friend's sister, Marion Bliersbach, and stayed in London. While working for the Deutsche Bank, he became increasingly enamored with photography, and, in 1907, jettisoned his commercial career and opened a portrait studio. According to Bill Jay, \n\n\"Within a few years, E.O. Hopp\u00e9 was the undisputed leader of pictorial portraiture in Europe. To say that someone has a \"household name\" has become a clich\u00e9, yet in Hopp\u00e9's case the phrase is apt. Rarely in the history of the medium has a photographer been so famous in his own lifetime among the general public. He was as famous as his sitters. It is difficult to think of a prominent name in the fields of politics, art, literature, and the theatre who did not pose for his camera.\"Although Hopp\u00e9 was one of the most important photographic artists of his era and highly celebrated in his time, in 1954, at the age of 76, he sold his body of photographic work to a commercial London picture archive, the Mansell Collection. In the collection, the work was filed by subject in with millions of other stock pictures and no longer accessible by author. Almost all of Hopp\u00e9's photographic work\u2014that which gained him the reputation as Britain's most influential international photographer between 1907 and 1939\u2014was accidentally obscured from photo-historians and from photo-history itself. It remained in the collection for over thirty years after Hopp\u00e9's death, and was not fully accessible to the public until the collection closed down and was acquired by new owners in the United States.\nIn 1994 photographic art curator Graham Howe retrieved Hopp\u00e9's photographic work from the picture library and rejoined it with the Hopp\u00e9 family archive of photographs and biographical documents. This was the first time since 1954 that the complete E.O. Hopp\u00e9 Collection was gathered together. Many years were spent in cataloguing, conservation, and research of the recovered work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hilaire Belloc", "response": ["thumb|upright|Hilaire Belloc portrait by Emil Otto Hopp\u00e9, 1915"]}, {"page": "Walkabout (magazine)", "response": ["This first issue with its cover by internationally known photographer Emil Otto Hopp\u00e9 set the benchmark, with profuse illustrations by others in the articles; 'Coming Down with Cattle', by Arthur W.
