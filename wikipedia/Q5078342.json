He sang 14 different principal roles with the company between 1919 and 1936, including all of the leading tenor roles in the company's 11 Gilbert and Sullivan productions, plus Cyril in Princess Ida, Strephon in Iolanthe and Mr. Box in Cox and Box.  Despite his long service with the company, he was disappointed, whenever the more famous tenor Derek Oldham appeared with the company, to be given second choices of the tenor roles or to be omitted altogether, in the case of two American tours.  Oldham also played the tenor roles in most of the recordings made by the company during Goulding's tenure.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Frederic||Henry Herbert||Dewey Gibson||Charles Goulding||John Dean||John Dean"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|Nanki-Poo||Dewey Gibson||Charles Goulding||Charles Goulding||John Dean||Neville Griffiths"]}, {"page": "Ruddigore", "response": ["|Richard Dauntless||Durward Lely||Courtice Pounds||Derek Oldham||Charles Goulding||John Dean"]}, {"page": "H.M.S.
