Their artistic styles were heavily influenced by their teacher, and none of them produced notable works of art. Arthur James Stark specialised in depicting landscapes and animals, and drew the cattle on a few of his father's pictures."]}, {"page": "Henry Bright (painter)", "response": ["Bright developed friendships with other leading artists, including Samuel Prout, Henry Jutsum, David Cox, George Lance, William Collingwood Smith, William Leighton Leitch and James Duffield Harding. He was influenced by Harding's oil and pencil technique and, like him, issued a number of drawing-books in the 1840s.  His use of chalk and stump on buff paper is similar to that of Robert Leman (1799\u20131863), while John Middleton strongly influenced his use of watercolour, particularly in around 1847."]}, {"page": "James Dafforne", "response": ["|Henry Jutsum"]}]}}
