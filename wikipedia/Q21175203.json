His methods make extensive use of the arts with particular emphasis on literary and vocal mediums of expression including creative writing, storytelling, and music. He is cited by peers as a pioneer in recognition of his original contribution to the expressive therapies.Newham began by teaching young adults with physical and developmental disabilities, many of whom could not articulate speech, assisting them in combining instrumental music and nonverbal vocalization as an expressive alternative to spoken communication. Subsequently, he worked psychotherapeutically with adults who were verbally articulate yet nonetheless could not satisfactorily communicate their reactions to traumatic events using spoken words. Newham therefore developed techniques that helped his clients understand the seemingly wordless nature of their distressing experience, and express it through artistic mediums, including dance, music, and drama. These techniques have been incorporated into professional practice by practitioners from a diverse range of disciplines.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eva Ibbotson", "response": ["Through her father, Ibbotson was half-sister of the writer Paul Newham and the Canadian filmmaker Barry Stevens, but never met them."]}, {"page": "Dartington College of Arts", "response": ["* Paul Newham (Psychotherapist and educator)"]}, {"page": "Jessica Kingsley Publishers", "response": ["* Paul Newham (Using Voice and.. in Therapy series, Therapeutic Voicework)"]}, {"page": "Subpersonality", "response": ["Early methods include Jungian analysis, psychosynthesis, transactional analysis, and gestalt therapy.

These include British psychotherapist  Paul Newham who pioneered the therapeutic use of expressive arts to explore subpersonalites through costume, mask, drama, and voice.McNiff, S., Integrating the Arts in Therapy: History, Theory, and Practice.
