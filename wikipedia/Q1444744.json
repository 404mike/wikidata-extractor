Rotations to scale numbers were standardized only in 1923. George Simpson, CBE (later Sir George Simpson), director of the UK Meteorological Office, was responsible for this and for the addition of the land-based descriptors. The measures were slightly altered some decades later to improve its utility for meteorologists. Nowadays, meteorologists typically express wind speed in kilometres or miles per hour or, for maritime and aviation purposes, knots; but Beaufort scale terminology is still sometimes used in weather forecasts for shipping and the severe weather warnings given to the public."]}, {"page": "George Simpson", "response": ["George Simpson may refer to:", "* Sir George Simpson (HBC administrator) (1792\u20131860), Scottish explorer and governor of Rupert's Land", "*  George Simpson (Canadian politician) (1858\u20131906), politician in Prince Edward Island, Canada", "* George Simpson (Western Australian politician) (1856\u20131906), member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia", "* George Simpson (Queensland politician) (1849\u20131919), member of the Parliament of Queensland", "* George Simpson (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u20131955), English football player for Doncaster Rovers and Chesterfield", "* George Simpson (footballer, born 1883) (1883\u2013?), English footballer for Sheffield Wednesday and West Bromwich Albion", "* George Simpson (footballer, born 1933) (1933\u20132012), English football player for Mansfield Town and Gillingham", "* Sir George Simpson (meteorologist) (1878\u20131965), meteorologist for Robert Falcon Scott's Antarctic expedition", "* George Simpson (botanist) (1880\u20131952), New Zealand botanist", "* George Simpson (Royal Navy officer) (1901\u20131972), British admiral", "* George Simpson (sprinter) (1908\u20131961), American runner", "* George Simpson, Baron Simpson of Dunkeld (born 1942), British businessman", "* George Simpson (golfer) (1887\u20131920), Scottish professional golfer"]}, {"page": "Apsley Cherry-Garrard", "response": ["Scott had left orders for dog-driver Meares and surgeon Edward L.

Assuming a water vapor-saturated stratosphere, Komabayashi and Ingersoll independently calculated the limit on outgoing infrared radiation that defines the runaway greenhouse state.

He concluded that over the previous fifty years the global land temperatures had increased, and proposed that this increase could be explained as an effect of the increase in carbon dioxide.Callendar, G. S. (1938) \"The artificial production of carbon dioxide and its influence on temperature\", Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, doi: 10.1002/qj.49706427503 These estimates have now been shown to be remarkably accurate,Hawkins, Ed & Phil Jones (2013) \"On increasing global temperatures: 75 years after Callendar\", Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, doi: 10.1002/qj.2178 especially as they were performed without the aid of a computer.Fleming, J.R. (2007) The Callendar Effect: the life and work of Guy Stewart Callendar (1898\u20131964) Amer Meteor Soc., Boston.  Callendar assessed the climate sensitivity value at 2\u00b0C, which is on the low end of the IPCC range. His findings were met with scepticism at the time; for example, Sir George Simpson, then director of the British Meteorological Society thought his results must be taken as a coincidence. However, his ideas did influence the scientific discourse of the time, which had been generally sceptical about the influence of changes in CO2 levels on global temperatures in the previous decades after debate over the idea in the early 20th century. His papers throughout the 1940s and 50s slowly convinced some other scientists of the need to conduct an organised research programme on CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, leading eventually to Charles Keeling's Mauna Loa Observatory measurements from 1958, which proved pivotal to advancing the theory of anthropogenic global warming. He remained convinced of the accuracy of his theory until his death in 1964 despite continued mainstream scepticism."]}, {"page": "C. S. Wright", "response": ["In Antarctica, Wright carried out numerous experiments on ice formations and ground radiation, and assisted meteorologist George Simpson. From January to mid-March 1911, he was one of four expedition members (with Thomas Griffith Taylor, Frank Debenham (Geologist) and Edgar Evans) who explored and mapped the western mountains of Victoria Land (the first western journey), performing scientific studies and geological observations. On 1 November 1911, Wright was a member of the Southern Party team that set off from their base camp at Cape Evans with the intention of reaching the South Pole. He hoped to be included in the polar party selected to accompany Scott on the final push to the Pole; however, on 22 December 1911 at latitude at 85\u00b0 15' South, seven weeks into the journey, while still 300 miles from the pole, he was in the first supporting party which Scott sent back. He spent the next five weeks helping the party navigate the 580 miles back to Cape Evans, where they waited for Scott and his party's return from the pole. Scott never arrived. On 12 November 1912, it was Wright, as a member of the 11-man search party led by Edward Atkinson, who first spotted the tent containing the bodies of Scott, Edward Wilson, and Henry Bowers, who had all perished on their return trek from the South Pole eight months earlier."]}, {"page": "List of Old Derbeians", "response": ["*Sir George Simpson FRS (1878\u20131965), meteorologist"]}, {"page": "Minna Bluff", "response": ["The researches of George Simpson, meteorologist on Scott's Terra Nova Expedition established that Minna Bluff has an effect on polar weather.

This division of the wind direction is, among other consequences, the cause of the \"windless bight\" area on the southern coast of Ross Island,Cherry-Garrard, Map, p. 346 an exceptionally cold area of fogs and low winds, encountered on various land journeys between McMurdo Sound and Cape Crozier undertaken on Scott's two expeditions."]}, {"page": "Cecil Meares", "response": ["Some controversy surrounds Meares's \"unavailability\" for further Barrier (Ross Ice Shelf) work for the 2 months prior to his boarding the Terra Nova to return home, while the base camp was under the command of George Simpson and then Edward Atkinson. Meares's return to civilisation before the Antarctic winter of 1912 was not unexpected (in Scott's instructions to the commanding officer of the Terra Nova written before his departure for the pole he stated that Meares might return on the ship, depending on letters from home), but it remains unclear as to why he was not available to undertake sledge work with the dogs during the autumn season, nor why Simpson or Atkinson did not force him to do so, given that the expedition was run on strict naval terms.

He also instructed Meares to take the dogs on a third journey over the barrier in early February. It is his orders concerning this journey that appear to be confused: it was initially planned merely to hasten the return of the polar party (in order to give them a chance of catching the ship), and not as a relief mission. However, the instructions Scott gave to Atkinson when the latter turned for home at the top of the Beardmore glacier, were for the dogs to \"come as far as they can.\" Unfortunately, Scott did not clarify his purpose (nor was he asked to \u2013 this was a Naval expedition), but perhaps at that stage he was anticipating that the dogs might be needed to see him home."]}, {"page": "Simpson Glacier", "response": ["Simpson Glacier () is a glacier, 6 miles (10\u00a0km) long, in the Admiralty Mountains.
