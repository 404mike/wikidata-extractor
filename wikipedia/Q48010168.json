He joined Birmingham City as a nine-year-old, went on to make his senior debut for the club in the 2017\u201318 FA Cup, and played ten times in the 2018\u201319 Championship. Despite missing two months with injury, Lakin managed 25 appearances on loan at League Two club Stevenage before the 2019\u201320 season ended prematurely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
