Holly also tells of thousands of years of holy wars fought by two factions: those who believed the humorous hats at Fuchal should be red and those who believed they should be blue. Ironically, Lister had wanted them to be green. Eventually, the two factions formed a truce and built two great space arks to go and search for Lister and the promised land. One of the two arks, following a set of sacred directions (Lister's laundry list, which he lined Frankenstein's basket with), promptly crashed into an asteroid. According to a dying cat priest (Noel Coleman), \"the sick and the lame\" cat people did not go on the arks with the rest of the cats, and were left on Red Dwarf to die. Two of these cats were the Cat's parents, a female \"cripple\" and a male \"idiot\" who ate his own feet. Over time, the rest of the cat people died off."]}, {"page": "Captain Pugwash", "response": ["These episodes were transmitted live and voiced by Noel Coleman.
