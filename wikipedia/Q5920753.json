His contributions to philosophy include a defense of sense-datum theories of perception and a variety of arguments against physicalism about the mind. He published an alternative version of the popular Knowledge Argument in his book Matter and Sense independently and in the same year as Frank Jackson, but Robinson's thought experiment involves sounds rather than colors. He is Professor of Philosophy at Central European University and recurring visiting professor at Rutgers University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Idealism", "response": ["* Howard Robinson"]}, {"page": "Mind\u2013body dualism", "response": ["Howard Robinson argues that, if predicate dualism is correct, then there are \"special sciences\" that are irreducible to physics. These allegedly irreducible subjects, which contain irreducible predicates, differ from hard sciences in that they are interest-relative. Here, interest-relative fields depend on the existence of minds that can have interested perspectives. Psychology is one such science; it completely depends on and presupposes the existence of the mind."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (D\u2013H)", "response": ["* Howard Robinson"]}, {"page": "Central European University", "response": ["* Howard Robinson, Philosophy"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* Howard Robinson (born 1945)"]}, {"page": "List of Oriel College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Howard Robinson \u2013 philosopher, Fellow and lecturer in philosophy (1970\u20131974), Provost (Pro-Rector) of the Central European University."]}, {"page": "Qualia", "response": ["===Howard Robinson and William Robinson===", "Howard Robinson is a philosopher who has concentrated his research within the philosophy of mind. Taking what has been through the latter part of the last century an unfashionable stance, he has consistently argued against those explanations of sensory experience that would reduce them to physical origins. He has never regarded the theory of sense-data as refuted, but has set out to refute in turn the objections which so many have considered to be conclusive. The version of the theory of sense-data he defends takes what is before consciousness in perception to be qualia as mental presentations that are causally linked to external entities, but which are not physical in themselves. Unlike the philosophers so far mentioned, he is therefore a dualist, one who takes both matter and mind to have real and metaphysically distinct natures. In one of his articles he takes the physicalist to task for ignoring the fact that sensory experience can be entirely free of representational character. He cites phosphenes as a stubborn example (phosphenes are flashes of neural light that result either from sudden pressure in the brain \u2013 as induced, for example, by intense coughing, or through direct physical pressure on the retina), and points out that it is grossly counter-intuitive to argue that these are not visual experiences on a par with open-eye seeing."]}]}}
