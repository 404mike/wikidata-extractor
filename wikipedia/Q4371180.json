Both ties and lugs were weakened by high local stresses where the bolt bore on them. Four of the fourteen lugs tested were unsound, having failed at lower than expected loadings. Some column top lugs outlasted the wrought iron, but the bottom lugs were significantly weaker.Mins of Ev pp. 303\u2013304 (Henry Law)", "Bouch had designed the bridge, assisted in his calculations by Allan Stewart.

Benjamin Baker said he would design to  with a safety margin, but in 15 years of looking he had yet to see wind overthrow a structure that would withstand .

Cochrane testified that he was not surprised that boltholes had been cast conical. He noted that moulders were notorious for this, unless you stood over them. Even so, he would not rely on supervision or inspection, he would have the holes bored or reamed to ensure they were cylindrical because it had an important bearing on the stability of the structure.
