Grimes (18 April 1927 \u2013 12 September 1988) was an English production designer and art director. He won an Oscar and was nominated for two more in the category Best Art Direction.Starting work in the British film industry after the Second World War as a sketch-artist, from the mid-1950s to the late 1960s Grimes worked almost exclusively with John Huston, a collaboration that resulted in 14 films in over 30 years. Grimes also had a fruitful long-term working relationship with Sydney Pollack, making seven films with him, and he was also employed by directors such as David Lean, Peter Yates, Mark Rydell and Ulu Grosbard.\nOne of his great strengths as a production designer was his skill as an artist: in researching and preparing a film he would produce many beautiful, dramatic and atmospheric sketches. These would help the director, director of photography and other key personnel to create the visual style and look of a film. Grimes understood the importance of light, space and texture \u2013 he put more into his sketches than most art directors \u2013 and tended to make sketches as much as or more than take photographs. He was not lavish; he liked the challenge of getting a good visual look with essentials, combining observation and imagination. Grimes was conscientious with high standards, and poured himself into his work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Production Design", "response": ["| Stephen B.

Two months after they asked him to join the project and after he finished work on directing Eyewitness (1981), Yates read the screenplay of The Dragons in Krull. He was \"intrigued\" with what he read and accepted the position of directing the film as a \"challenge\". He reasoned in a 1983 interview that Krull would be one of those rare films that \"can take full advantage of today's special effects techniques\" and would differ from his more realistic previous works in that, instead of having to research, he would have to make the movie entirely based on his imagination. The film was in a year of pre-production, which involved Sherman editing the script, Yates creating storyboards, Stephen B. Grimes and Derek Meddings coming up with and drawing set concepts, and Ken Marshall and Anthony being cast as Colwyn and Lyssa respectively."]}]}}
