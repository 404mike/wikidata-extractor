Upon its release, the song failed to reprise the success of \"Dilemma\". In April 2011, Rowland appeared on Italian DJ Alex Gaudino's single \"What a Feeling\", which became another UK top-ten hit. Originally scheduled for release in 2010, Rowland's third studio album Here I Am was released on July 26, 2011, in the United States. The album sold 77,000\u00a0copies in its first week and debuted atop the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Here I Am produced the successful lead single \"Commander\", which peaked in the top-ten of many charts in Europe, and the UK top-ten single \"Down for Whatever\". It also included another successful single \"Motivation\", with Lil Wayne, which topped the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Motivation\" won Song of the Year at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards and Top R&B Song at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Rowland was the face of Diddy's women's fragrance Empress, the female counterpart to his men's fragrance I Am King. She was also the worldwide ambassador for watchmakers company TW Steel.

Later that year, it was confirmed that Rowland would replace Dannii Minogue as a judge for the eighth series of The X Factor UK alongside Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow (who replaced Simon Cowell), and Tulisa Contostavlos (who replaced Cheryl Cole). Rowland's team of finalists in the \"Girls\" category, including Amelia Lily, finished in third place in one series. Due to a conflicting schedule, Rowland did not return for the ninth series in 2012 and was replaced by former judge of The X Factor USA, Nicole Scherzinger. During the Black Women in Music event held on February 8, 2012, Essence magazine honored Rowland and music executive Sylvia Rhone for their contributions to music. In April 2012, Rowland toured Australia alongside Ludacris, Chris Brown, Trey Songz, T-Pain, Ice Cube, Lupe Fiasco, and Big Sean for the urban festival, Supafest.
