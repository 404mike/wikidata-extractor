All the while, returning silver medalist Mutaz Essa Barshim and former world indoor champion Gianmarco Tamberi maintained a clean sheet to be tied for first place. Jumping in the first position, Barshim's perfection put pressure on the rest of the field to maintain at each new height, which only Tamberi could match. At 2.37 metres, Barshim cleared again. After missing once at 2.35 metres, Maksim Nedasekau strategically passed to 2.37 metres and made it on his first attempt. After Tamberi also cleared 2.37 metres, the three other athletes still in contention passed to 2.39 metres, with Nedasekau holding the bronze medal position pending the results at 2.39.
