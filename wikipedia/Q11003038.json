After losing an arm in active service in 1917, he was a Test cricket umpire for 31 years. Wisden stated in his obituary that he \"raised umpiring to a higher level than had ever been known in the history of cricket\".Chester was born in Bushey. An all-rounder, Alec Hearne suggested that he qualify for Worcestershire. Chester played as a left-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm bowler in 55 first-class matches for Worcestershire as a teenager from 1912 to 1914. In 1913, when he was 17 years old, he scored 108 against Somerset to become the youngest player then to score a county century, a record that still stood until the 1950s. During 1913 Chester was summoned to meet Dr W G Grace who wished to congratulate him on a century scored at Lord's that season. He was praised in the 1913 Wisden as the \"youngest professional regularly engaged in first-class cricket ... Very few players in the history of cricket have shown such form at the age of seventeen and a half\". In 1914, he scored his highest first-class score, 178 not out, against Essex.\nHe volunteered to served in the First World War and joined the Royal Field Artillery in a battery commanded by Major Allsopp, captain of the Worcestershire Second Eleven. He served at the Second Battle of Loos and moved with his unit to Salonika he lost his right arm below the elbow in July 1917 after a shrapnel wound became gangrenous, ending his cricket playing career.\nChester turned to umpiring when he returned to England, using an artificial arm to make the necessary signals, and stood in his first first-class match in 1922, showing early promise and an uncompromising fairness. In his first county match as an umpire, between Essex and Somerset at Leyton, he gave both captains out, J. W. H. T. Douglas lbw and John Daniell stumped.  He was widely recognised as the best umpire in England for many years.  Sir Donald Bradman said he was the greatest umpire under whom he had played, but Chester objected to the strident appealing of the visiting Australians in 1948 and 1953, and did not stand in the 1953 Ashes Tests after the First Test.One unusual decision was when Sonny Ramadhin bowled Doug Insole off his pads in the Test between England and West Indies at Trent Bridge in 1950.  Chester doggedly stuck to his decision to give Insole out lbw rather than bowled, claiming that he raised his finger to mark the dismissal in the time between the ball touching Insole's pads and then hitting the stumps.\nChester stood in what was then a world record 48 Tests from 1924 to 1955. The record was later passed by Dickie Bird. Two years after officiating in his last Test match, Chester died in the town of his birth, Bushey, Hertfordshire, having suffered from stomach ulcers for much of his later years, a painful complaint that created an irascible temper that marred his decision-making towards the end of his career. E.W. Swanton described him as \"as nearly infallible as a man could be in his profession\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Fingleton", "response": ["An infamous incident occurred in Australia's second innings. As Australia were 247 runs behind on the first innings and forced to follow on, they played for a draw and Brown and Fingleton batted slowly in the second innings. Sections of the crowd heckled his slow batting by using a slow hand clap. Bradman then sent Mervyn Waite out to deliver orders to the openers that they should back away from their positions and hold up proceedings until the barracking stopped. Fingleton said that he was not perturbed by the crowd but obeyed; umpire Frank Chester and England captain Wally Hammond had no issues with this. At one point, Fingleton theatrically decided to take off his gloves, put down his bat and sit down on the pitch and refusing to resume before the gallery quietened, but this only caused a huge uproar.Growden, p. 143. Wisden later criticised him, saying that he lost \"all true sense of the situation...an extraordinary action on the part of a cricket in a Test match.\" They regarded the gesture as disrespectful as a majority of the spectators had not heckled him."]}, {"page": "Lindsay Hassett", "response": ["In the Fourth Test, the Australians worked themselves into a position to win the match and thus retain the Ashes. Hassett made 37 as his team compiled 266 and took a 99-run first innings lead. The tourists looked set for victory and retention of The Ashes at the start of the final day, but time-wasting and defiant defence from the English batsmen left Australia a target of 177 in the last two hours. This would have required a scoring rate much higher than in the first four days of the match.Haigh, p. 79. Hassett made only four, but Australia had made 111 in 75 minutes and were on schedule for a win. At that point, English medium-pacer Trevor Bailey began bowling with the wicket-keeper more than two metres down the leg side in order to deny the Australians an opportunity to hit the ball, but the umpires did not penalise them as wides. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 4/147 when time ran out. English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans said that \"they were right\" in claiming that Bailey's bowling was \"the worst kind of negative cricket\" and that he had \"cheated [them] of victory\".Haigh, p. 80. The match was also marred by a series of umpiring decisions made by Frank Chester against the Australians, leading Hassett to request that he not be appointed for the Fifth Test, something the English cricket authorities granted.Haigh, p. 123."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Frank Chester||||48||1924||1955"]}, {"page": "George Hele", "response": ["Although known primarily for his role in the Bodyline series, Hele was recognised as the best umpire in South Australia at the time of his selection to umpire in Test matches, and was held in high regard by players and officials from both Australian teams and touring international teams. In an interview after Hele's first Test series as umpire, the English captain, Percy Chapman reported that, although the English missed the retired Bob Crockett, Hele had \"proved a worthy successor to that great umpire, and [he] would hold his own anywhere\".\"Chapman Interviewed\" \u2013 The Examiner (Launceston, Tasmania). Published 18 March 1929. Retrieved 2 November 2012. Despite Hele's opinion of Douglas Jardine's tactics during the bodyline, Jardine respected his umpiring ability, and in a 1932 letter to an Australian cricket official, placed him on the same level as England's Frank Chester: \"as you know, we in England bracket Hele and Chester as the two best umpires in the world\". Similarly, Sir Donald Bradman wrote in his 1950 book Farewell to Cricket that both he and the Englishmen agreed that Hele was \"the best Australian umpire between the two wars\". In 1959, writing his book Australian Cricket: A History, noted cricket journalist Johnny Moyes wrote \"in the opinion of those qualified to judge, [Hele] was perhaps the finest umpire Australia has produced\".Moyes, A. G., Australian Cricket: A History, Sydney, Angus & Robertson, 1959. As late as 1970, a journalist described Hele as a \"gentle man, still tall and erect, and with a keen eye\"."]}, {"page": "Geoff Griffin", "response": ["The Laws of Cricket, in their various formulations, had always specified that the ball delivered to the batsman must be bowled, not thrown \u2013 that is, the bowler's arm must be straight at the point of delivery. This rule had, from time to time, created problems in the game. Around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the Australian umpire Jim Phillips no-balled the Australian fast bowler Ernie Jones for throwing; the same umpire ended the career of England's star bowler Arthur Mold by declaring his bowling action illegal. Fifty years later, during South Africa's 1951 tour of England,  the umpire Frank Chester wanted to no-ball the South African quick bowler Cuan McCarthy, but was told by the Lord's authorities to desist: \"These people are our guests\". England's Tony Lock was called for throwing during a Test Match in the West Indies, in 1953\u201354 (he subsequently remodelled his bowling action). The issue arose again during England's 1958\u201359 Australian tour, which was dominated by the suspect actions of four Australian bowlers: Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke, Keith Slater and Jim Burke; Jack Fingleton, the former Australian batsman, provocatively entitled his account of the series Four Chukkas to Australia. Neither England's captain, Peter May, nor the tour manager, Freddie Brown, raised the issue publicly during the series, but did so afterwards, causing considerable concern to the leading administrators on each side, Gubby Allen and Sir Donald Bradman. The principal issue in these administrators' minds was what would happen if these bowlers were brought to England in 1961, when the Australians were due to visit. They decided that the matter had to be resolved before then, and accordingly they resolved to adopt what they termed a \"zero tolerance\" policy during the intervening period, especially with regard to the forthcoming 1960 tour to England  by South Africa."]}, {"page": "Frank Chester (cricket)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Chester (umpire)"]}, {"page": "Throwing (cricket)", "response": ["An epidemic of throwing plagued cricket in the 1950s.

Barnes made an appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Barnes walked down the pitch and reportedly muttered to umpire Frank Chester in a casual tone \"Eh, the light!\", which allegedly shocked the arbiter. During the previous Ashes series in Australia, Barnes had continuously made time-wasting appeals against the light, which forced cricket administrators to limit the batting team to one appeal; if this was declined it would be up to the umpires to offer an adjournment.Fingleton, p. 88. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs.Arlott, pp. 33\u201334. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball bowling of Edrich and Bedser. They reached stumps at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on six. Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon, and Yardley's decision to place his bowlers Young and Bedser in that region raised surprise; bowlers tend to lack the agility and reflexes needed for such positions. At this stage, following their tail-end resistance, England were in a good position with runs on the board if rain struck overnight and caused a sticky wicket, forcing the Australians to bat in hostile conditions the following day."]}, {"page": "Sid Barnes with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["The following match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were almost a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman chose Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown continued out of position in the middle order. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. For players on both sides, it was a chance to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted and Morris fell with the score at 1/11. Barnes added 160 for the next wicket with Bradman before falling for 81 with the score at 2/171. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings; Barnes caught John Deighton and Jack Robertson and took 0/15 from four overs. During the match, Barnes again gained attention for placing himself extremely close to the batsman when fielding at short leg, with one foot on the edge of the cut strip. According to retired Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, himself a former fielder in the leg trap, \"[Barnes\u2019s position] was the closest I have ever seen any fieldsman on the leg side\". Bradman had suggested Barnes do so when leading English batsman Len Hutton was playing, in an attempt to distract or intimidate him. Barnes later claimed he was at little risk as Hutton was reluctant to hook Australia's pace bowlers towards him and preferred to duck bowling aimed at his upper body. He said Hutton often talked pessimistically to teammates and that the Australians would benefit if they dampened Hutton's confidence.Perry (2008), pp. 68\u201369. Although Hutton top-scored in both innings, scoring 52 and 64, Barnes said the batsman's eyes betrayed discomfort. The theatrical Barnes also decided to test the umpire's patience by hovering his foot over the pitch, as though he were about to place it down on the batting surface, which was against the laws of cricket. Umpire Frank Chester, who was also known for his flamboyance and penchant for making himself visible, at one point held up proceedings momentarily when Barnes feigned to put his foot on the surface as the bowler was preparing to deliver the ball.Perry (2008), pp. 74\u201375.", "Having overcome food poisoning leading up to the match,Perry (2008), pp. 104\u2013106. Barnes was selected for the First Test at Trent Bridge, as were the other two openers in the squad. England elected to bat first,Fingleton, p. 82. and Australia's fast bowlers reduced the home side to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first afternoon. In Australia's reply, Barnes partnered Morris at the top of the order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. The pair had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Bill Edrich. Barnes walked down the pitch and was reported to have casually muttered to umpire Frank Chester \"Eh, the light!\", which appeared to shock the official. During the previous Ashes series in Australia in 1946\u201347, Barnes continuously appealed against the light, forcing cricket authorities to limit the batting team to one appeal, after which only the umpire can call off play, at his own prerogative.Fingleton, p. 88. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball attack of Edrich and Alec Bedser to reach stumps at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on 6. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs.Arlott, pp. 33\u201334.

Late in the day, after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind by Don Tallon after attempting a cut shot from Johnson's bowling. Edrich did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39.Fingleton, p. 97. Denis Compton came in and he ran down the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block the ball on the run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount of spin from the surface.O'Reilly, p. 43.

Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250.Fingleton, p. 165. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester's actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes.O'Reilly, p. 126. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls,Fingleton, p. 166. but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control."]}, {"page": "Dai Davies (cricketer)", "response": ["He also became a Test umpire, standing in at least one Test match in England each summer from 1947 and 1958.

After consulting with fellow umpire Frank Chester, Davies gave Len Hutton out for obstructing the field, the only occasion of this dismissal arising in Test cricket. Hutton had miscued a hook shot against Athol Rowan, and hit the ball a second time to defend his stumps, impeding the South African wicketkeeper Russell Endean as he tried to take the catch."]}]}}
