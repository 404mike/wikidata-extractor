Following his father's promotion in the peerage in 1529 to Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, he adopted his father's junior title Viscount Rochford (created in 1525) as a courtesy title. He was accused of incest with his sister Anne during the period of her trial for high treason, as a result of which both were executed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1503", "response": ["** George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, English diplomat (d. 1536)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire", "response": ["* George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford (c. 1504 - 17 May 1536), eldest surviving son and heir apparent who predeceased his father, having been executed in 1536 together with his sister the queen.

Anne's brother, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford (with whom she was accused of committing incest), is shown anxiously trying to advise and counsel her to be more prudent and cautious in her conduct with the King. But Anne continues to berate Henry for his infidelities, which elicits not-so-veiled threats from him in return. Anne's final failure to give Henry a son seals her doom. The storyline was heavily influenced by academic theories that believed Anne was the victim of a factional and political plot, concocted by her many enemies (among them, Thomas Cromwell and Lady Rochford, Anne's sister-in-law), who capitalised on the king's disillusionment with her. The scriptwriter used Anne's final confession of her sins (a burden that Archbishop Thomas Cranmer would have to bear to the end of his days), to suggest her innocence on charges of adultery, incest, treason and witchcraft."]}, {"page": "Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford", "response": ["Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford (n\u00e9e Jane Parker; c. 1505 \u2013 13 February 1542), was an English noblewoman. Her husband, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, was the brother of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII. Jane had been a member of the household of Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon. It is possible that she played a role in the verdicts against, and subsequent executions of, her husband and Anne Boleyn. She was later a lady-in-waiting to Henry's third and fourth wives, and then to his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, with whom she was executed."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire", "response": ["*George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford (c. 1503 \u2013 17 May 1536)."]}, {"page": "Mark Smeaton", "response": ["At 6\u00a0pm on 1 May, Smeaton was sent to the Tower of London. Before his arrest, Smeaton was known to spend lavishly on horses and liveries.  This was seen as suspicious, as Smeaton earned only \u00a3100 a year; the implication being that he had received money from the Queen in exchange for \"services\" as her lover.  While at the Tower, Smeaton confessed to being the Queen's lover.  The confession did not align with the facts: Smeaton stated he was with the Queen on 13 May 1535 at Greenwich. However, it is recorded that she was not at Greenwich on that date but at Richmond.  It is believed that when being pressured to confess, Smeaton also supplied the names of members of the Queen's circle and all were subsequently arrested. Those arrested for alleged adultery with Anne as a result of Smeaton's confession were Sir Francis Weston, Henry Norris, William Brereton, and her brother, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford.  All but Smeaton maintained their innocence, but none of them was tortured as Smeaton was.  Out of all those arrested for adultery, Smeaton's arrest caused the greatest scandal, because those who knew of the charges were shocked that the Queen would have an affair with a person of such low degree."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Seymour, Lady Cromwell", "response": ["In May 1536, Anne Boleyn was accused of treason and adultery with Mark Smeaton, a court musician, the courtiers Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, William Brereton and her brother, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford.", "This undated letter is placed at the end of July 1540 in Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII. It was probably written while Thomas Cromwell was imprisoned in the Tower, as Elizabeth refers to her father-in-law, and not her late father-in-law.

His father is said to have offered all the family had in order to gain a pardon for his son. The evidence supporting the accusations is dubious. Although a myth has arisen in the last twenty years that the men were accused of \"buggery\" as well as treason, this is unlikely to be true. This myth has arisen solely due to the unsubstantiated theories of Retha Warnicke in her 1989 biography of Anne Boleyn. None of the men was charged with \"buggery\" with the Queen or with each other, and there were no extant claims of homosexual nor heterosexual misconduct relating to any of them. Francis was beheaded on Tower Hill on 17 May 1536 along with his co-accused, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford; William Brereton; Henry Norris and Mark Smeaton."]}, {"page": "Boleyn", "response": ["*George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, brother of Anne"]}, {"page": "Master of the Buckhounds", "response": ["*1528: George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford"]}, {"page": "List of people executed by the Tudors", "response": ["|George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford"]}, {"page": "Writ of acceleration", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"1533-2-5\"|5 February 1533 || George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford || Viscount Rochford || Never succeeded || Only son of Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire; brother of Anne Boleyn"]}, {"page": "The Other Boleyn Girl (2008 film)", "response": ["* Jim Sturgess as George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford.
