They were based at RAF Waddington in the UK and assigned to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for nuclear operations; neither aerial refuelling nor conventional bombing had been practised for several years. A request from Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward, the commander of the British aircraft carrier group heading south, on 11 April for recommendations for targets to attack in the Falkland Islands led to reconsideration of the possibility of attacks using Vulcans. Options for attacks on airfields and ports on the Argentine mainland were discarded as politically provocative and unlikely to produce worthwhile results. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Beetham argued that the Vulcan threat would cause the Argentinians to retain fighters in the north of Argentina."]}, {"page": "Marshal of the Royal Air Force", "response": ["|14 October 1982||100px||Sir Michael Beetham||1923||2015||Chief of the Air Staff 1977\u20131982Promoted and retired on the same day."]}, {"page": "RAF Second Tactical Air Force", "response": ["* 19 January 1976 \u2013 Air Marshal Sir Michael Beetham"]}, {"page": "Marshal of the air force", "response": ["|United Kingdom||1982|| ||Sir Michael Beetham||Marshal of the Royal Air Force||1923||2015||Promoted and retired on the same day (14 October 1982).Probert, p. 137."]}, {"page": "1959 in South Africa", "response": ["* 9 \u2013 Wing Commander Michael Beetham flying a Royal Air Force Vickers Valiant sets a record of 11 hours 27 minutes for a non-stop London-Cape Town flight."]}, {"page": "Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment", "response": ["The memorandum of understanding establishing the unit was signed in 1979 by the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy and the unit came into existence on 29 January 1981 with Sir Michael Beetham in attendance.
