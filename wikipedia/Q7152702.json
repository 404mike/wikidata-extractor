C. Green and later, Justin Broadrick, since 1983 in noise outfit Fall of Because; a band that would break up in 1987 and later reform in 1988 at Broadrick\u2019s initiative, now evolved into the industrial noise core that was Godflesh.Neville is noted for his distinctive style, which can be said to be influenced by that of Geordie Walker of Killing Joke, but with an even greater experimental edge and a flair for drawn out improvisation, creating an unusual and original synergy of noise and melody akin to some of the work of Norman Westberg, Justin Broadrick and Robert Hampson.Apart from his work with Fall of Because and Godflesh, Neville is also the founder of the underground experimental noise band Cable Regime, also featuring Diarmuid Dalton (now also bassist with Jesu) and Steve Hough (also involved with Justin Broadrick\u2019s Final, and once a Godflesh touring member), which has been his main project since 1992.\nNeville continues to be on good terms with Justin Broadrick, with Broadrick co-producing all of Cable Regime\u2019s albums and Neville making a guest appearance on the track \u201cMan/Woman\u201d from Jesu\u2019s eponymous debut album.\nNeville has also featured in a techno collaboration called AKA, but little is known of this outfit apart from a track released on the Lo Fibre Companion in 1998.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Godflesh", "response": ["The band that would eventually become Godflesh, Fall of Because, formed in 1982 when G. C. Green and Paul Neville, two young musicians living in cheap council estate housing in east Birmingham, started experimenting musically alongside a drum machine. Fall of Because, so named for a Killing Joke song and a chapter from an Aleister Crowley book, found a live drummer when Justin Broadrick, who lived in the same council housing as Green and Neville, joined the group in 1984 after organising a concert at The Mermaid in Birmingham. At that show, Fall of Because, Final (Broadrick's first musical act) and an early incarnation of Napalm Death performed before a crowd of twenty-five people. In the months following that concert, Broadrick joined Napalm Death as a guitarist and Fall of Because as a drummer and altered the latter's sound by introducing albums from Swans, Sonic Youth and Discharge to Green and Neville.

The first name they went under was Atrocity Exhibition, named after a Joy Division track (which, itself, takes its name from a book by J. G. Ballard). Their first recording was titled Live in the Studio and was the first catalogued release on their cassette label Post Mortem Rekordings. Shortly after, the project was named Smear Campaign, after a Nocturnal Emissions track. This was the name they went under at their first live performance on 7 July 1984 in The Mermaid in Birmingham. Promptly after the show they settled on the name Final. Final was then inspired lyrically and musically by acts such as Throbbing Gristle and Maurizio Bianchi. \"We were pretty heavily into the whole industrial tape culture and fanzines of the very early '80s\", Broadrick says. The project developed to embrace the power electronics subgenre of industrial music in 1983, releasing material by them and other industrial projects on Post Mortem Rekordings (which was renamed Uprising Productions in 1985) such as Family Patrol Group, Mental Health Act, Ashenden, The Grey Wolves, Con-Dom, Death Magazine 52, Fern and Un-Kommuniti.

In December, the self-titled debut LP was released. This release featured Ted Parsons on drums, Diarmuid Dalton on bass and a guest appearance from Paul Neville. The album was more melodic than his previous work. \"I was still making low-tuned, heavy, guttural music, at the heart of this there was something quite pretty and beautiful, just being construed in an almost ugly fashion\", said Broadrick. In November 2005 Broadrick played live as Final for the first time in 20 years and supported Jarboe. Final's two-disc release 3 had been in making for nearly five years and was put out in 2006. Broadrick toured Europe as Final in March 2006. In April 2006 the Silver EP was released through Hydra Head Records. The second full-length album, Conqueror, was released in February 2007. Jesu toured with Sunn O))) and Isis and Broadrick played as a guest with both bands. On 30 April 2007 Jesu released a 12\" called Sun Down/Sun Rise. Broadrick began to release limited runs of material on his Avalanche Recordings label, including new material by Final and a Jesu full-length compilation of electronic tracks titled Pale Sketches. In 2008, Broadrick collaborated with former Swans vocalist Jarboe for an album titled J\u00b2.
