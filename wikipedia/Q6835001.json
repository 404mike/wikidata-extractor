He scored 95 goals in 458 competitive matches in a 15-year career.\nBeginning his career with Manchester United, he enjoyed a loan spell with Sheffield United, without ever making a league appearance for the \"Red Devils\". He signed with Port Vale in July 2000, moving on to non-league Leigh RMI a year later. In 2002, he transferred to Chester City, joining Morecambe two years later. He won promotion into the English Football League with both clubs, helping Chester to the Conference title in 2003\u201304 and playing for the \"Shrimps\" in their play-off final success in 2007. After six years with Morecambe, he moved on to Altrincham via Stalybridge Celtic in 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Giuliano Grazioli", "response": ["Grazioli joined Barnet as part of a deal that took Junior Agogo to Bristol Rovers. Rovers paid \u00a3110,000 for Agogo with Grazioli going the other way. He helped Barnet gain promotion from the Football Conference to the Football League in 2004/2005. He was the top scorer in the conference with 29 goals - seven more than nearest rival Michael Twiss of Morecambe. A hand injury kept Grazioli out of much of the following season - Barnet's first season back in League Two."]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["In preparation for life in the Second Division, Horton signed Dean Delany, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and Michael Twiss on free transfers. Horton came under pressure from the board at the start of the 2000\u201301 campaign, as his team went 13 games without a win, and were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League Canvey Island. Horton described it as \"the greatest embarrassment of my football career\". He responded to this humiliation by placing five players on the transfer list. He signed Steve Brooker for \u00a315,000; brought in Onandi Lowe and Richard Burgess on free transfer, whilst also offloading Jeff Minton to Rotherham United. Vale's form improved, as they avoided defeat to Stoke City in both Potteries derby games. Horton was named Manager of the Month in March, after a good run of results ended fears of a second successive relegation. He also won his first trophy as a manager as Vale lifted the Football League Trophy, coming from behind to beat Brentford at the Millennium Stadium. Vale upset supporters by selling Dave Brammer to Crewe Alexandra for \u00a3500,000."]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["| Michael Twiss"]}, {"page": "Twiss", "response": ["* Michael Twiss (born 1977), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Manchester United F.C.
