His chance meeting with James MacLaren has been described as \"undoubtedly a seminal point in the subsequent development of the Arts and Crafts Movement\", and led to the furnishing of the meeting room of the Art Workers Guild with a large number of his chairs which can still be seen today. These chairs have been \"highly influential\", having been \"seen by almost everyone involved in art and design from the late 1880s\".  They particularly influenced Ernest Gimson who, in 1890, spent six weeks with Clissett learning to make ladderback chairs. Clissett's chairs were popular with the Arts and Crafts cognoscenti, and were used by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in early commissions, and by the architectural team of Richard Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin.

After each produced a site layout, Baines accepted one submitted by Phillips who had concluded the estate should look \u2018as if it had grown and not merely been dropped there\u2019. It has been described as 'the first and most spectacular of the garden suburbs built by the government during the First World War to house munitions workers.' The estate was intended from the start to be a showpiece solution to the emergency housing problems created by the war. Phillips' layout followed the low-density principles established by Richard Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin and others involved in the Garden city movement between 1900 and the outbreak of World War I. Faced with the acute wartime problems of materials supply, Baines's approach was to make use of all and any materials that might be available; architecturally the result was a tour-de-force of picturesque design. Variety in materials and finishes (timber-framing, tile-hanging, slate-hanging, stone, brick and rendering) was matched by the complexity of shape and silhouette, and combined with period details such as the raised pavement to produce a virtuoso re-creation of the \u2018old English Village\u2019.Mark Swenarton in Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England, London 2 South, Penguin Books, 1983 The uniqueness of the design of the estate still makes the area popular today.http://progressestate.blogspot.com/ Residents' Association Website"]}, {"page": "Listed buildings in Marple, Greater Manchester", "response": ["|The house, stable and coach house were designed by Richard Barry Parker in Arts and Crafts style.
