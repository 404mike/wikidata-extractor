The first is that faith schools contribute successfully to community cohesion; they are culturally diverse and there is no evidence that there is any social division on racial or ethnic grounds. The second important fact acknowledged in the Theos report is that faith schools do not intentionally filter or skew admissions in a way which is designed to manipulate the system.\" The study also stated that much \"of the debate [about faith schools] is by nature ideological, revolving around the relative rights and responsibilities of parents, schools and government in a liberal and plural society.\" The Bishop of Oxford concurred, stating that \"children are being denied the chance to go to some of Britain\u2019s best schools because antireligious campaigners have turned attempts to expand faith schools into an ideological battle-ground\".  Responding to the report, BHA, now Humanists UK Chief Executive Andrew Copson commented, \"Although the report masquerades as a new, impartial, survey of evidence surrounding \"faith\u201d schools, it is in fact more like apologetics for such schools. The report omits evidence, misrepresents evidence and even makes basic errors about types of school and types of data that undermine its claim to be taken seriously.
