Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\", the latter of which attacked Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they popularised punk rock in the UK. \"God Save the Queen\" was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the \"most heavily censored record in British history\".", "The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar.
