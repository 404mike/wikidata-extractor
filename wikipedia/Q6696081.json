He went to Ebersdorf, near Lobenstein, Vogtland, Germany in 1853, studying botany and chemistry for a year. In 1855, he accompanied Robert MacAndrew on a dredging excursion from the Shetland Islands to Norway and beyond the Arctic Circle; he subsequently made other cruises, to Greenland and to the coast of Spain. These expeditions laid the foundations of an extensive knowledge of the distribution of marine life.\nJames Scott Bowerbank named in 1858 a new species of deep-sea sponge after him: Geodia barretti. It had been collected by R. MacAndrew and L. Barrett on the Norwegian coast.\nIn 1855, he was engaged by Adam Sedgwick to assist in the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge. During the following three years, he aided the professor by delivering lectures. He discovered bones of birds in the Cambridge Greensand, and he prepared a geological map of Cambridge on the one-inch Ordnance map. In 1859, when he was twenty-two, he was appointed director of the Geological Survey of Jamaica. There, he determined the Cretaceous age of certain rocks that contained Hippurites. S. P. Woodward named the new genus Barrettia after him. Barrett also collected many fossils from the Miocene and newer strata.\nHe drowned, at the age of twenty-five, while investigating the sea-bottom off Kingston, Jamaica. His posthumous son Arthur Barrett and grandson Lucas Barrett were electrical engineers and ran the firm of Baily, Grundy and Barrett in Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1837 in science", "response": ["* November 14 \u2013 Lucas Barrett (died 1862), Canadian-born British naturalist."]}, {"page": "1862 in science", "response": ["* December 18 \u2013 Lucas Barrett (born 1837), English naturalist (drowned)"]}, {"page": "List of drowning victims", "response": ["*Lucas Barrett, English naturalist and geologist in 1862."]}, {"page": "1837 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 14 November \u2013 Lucas Barrett, naturalist (died 1862)"]}, {"page": "List of Old Gowers", "response": ["*Lucas Barrett (OG ?-?), English geologist and naturalist"]}, {"page": "1862 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 19 December \u2013 Lucas Barrett, naturalist and geologist (b. 1837)"]}, {"page": "Barrett (name)", "response": ["* Lucas Barrett (born 1837), English geologist"]}, {"page": "Geodia barretti", "response": ["This sponge was named in honor of one of its discoverers, the biologist Lucas Barrett (1837-1862).", "This sponge was collected by biologists Robert McAndrew and Lucas Barrett in 1855 on the South side of Vikna Island (formerly called Vigten or Vikten Island), North-Tr\u00f8ndelag, Norway, at a depth of 183 meters.
