Boyd plays as a striker and started off playing in school while attending Grange Primary School, in his hometown of Hartlepool.\nDuring his studies at Hartlepool Manor School of Technology, he played for Hartlepool United, making his debut in 1999. Signing professional forms there, he stayed at his hometown club until 2006, save for a short loan spell at Boston United in 2004. He then moved to Luton Town for a fee of \u00a3500,000, but found the style of football employed in the Championship difficult to adjust to, and left a year later, joining Leyton Orient on a free transfer. After spending two seasons at Orient, he returned to Hartlepool United. However, his second spell at the club was not as successful as his first, and he was quietly released in 2012. Since then, he has played non-league football, with Celtic Nation, Lincoln City, Spennymoor Town and Bishop Auckland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 25", "response": ["*1982 \u2013 Adam Boyd, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Leyton Orient F.C.", "response": ["Leyton Orient kicked off the 2008\u201309 season with a 2\u20131 win over Hereford United at home. Dean Beckwith put Hereford ahead before JJ Melligan and Adam Boyd gave Orient the win. Orient then continued the season with multiple poor results and performances throughout September and October and their only wins were away matches against Walsall and Southend United in the Football League Trophy first round. However Orient were knocked out of the trophy in the following round in an away match at Brighton & Hove Albion. They were in 22nd position in the League One table. Orient booked a place in the second round of the FA Cup after beating Colchester United 1\u20130. Two Goals from Jason Demetriou and Danny Granville in a 1\u20132 away victory against Bradford City put Orient through to the third round of the FA Cup where they played Sheffield United at home. They lost 4\u20131 and, after a run of bad form in the league, Orient parted company with manager Martin Ling and assistant Dean Smith. Youth team manager Kevin Nugent was named caretaker manager overseeing three games. On 5 February 2009 Geraint Williams was announced as manager until the end of the season. He enjoyed a very positive start, winning seven of his first nine matches and moving Orient up to 15th. After Geraint Williams' positive influence on the team they secured their League One status on 13 April with a 1\u20130 win over Swindon Town at the County Ground and eventually finished the season in 14th place."]}, {"page": "Adam (given name)", "response": ["* Adam Boyd (born 1982), English footballer "]}, {"page": "Kevin Blackwell", "response": ["On 27 March 2007, Blackwell was announced as the new manager of Luton Town and began his tenure with a draw against Burnley. Luton were already in the bottom 3 when Blackwell took over and were 9 points from safety with 3 games to go. Blackwell set about rebuilding the side, his priority to get in some experience. To achieve this he sold centre back Leon Barnett to West Bromwich Albion, and defender Kevin Foley to Wolves, as well as releasing centre-back Russ Perrett and \u00a3500,000 signing Adam Boyd, who went on to score 14 goals that season for Leyton Orient. He also lost Markus Heikkinen on a free transfer. In replacement he brought in high-profile players such as Paul Peschisolido, Chris Perry, Don Hutchison, Paul McVeigh and Paul Furlong.

After a slow start he forced his way into the team after coming on as a substitute against Doncaster Rovers and scoring two late goals to secure a dramatic 3-2 win. This earned him a place alongside Adam Boyd in the Hartlepool line-up and the pair formed a legendary strike partnership. He then went on to notch 14 goals in 37 appearances.

After developing into a good footballer, he joined Hartlepool's Youth Development programme, the same programme that developed players such as Adam Boyd and Jim Provett into first team regulars.

He received his first red card against Milton Keynes Dons after a tussle with Izale McLeod but he more than made up for it when he scored his first hattrick against Chesterfield in his next appearance. Sweeney's deceiving runs from midfield enabled him to get in behind opposition defences and this helped him to notch up 12 goals for the season, making him Hartlepool's highest scoring midfield player. This made him one of the front-runners for both Hartlepool's Fans' and Players' Player of the Year, but he missed out to Joel Porter and Adam Boyd respectively."]}, {"page": "Eifion Williams", "response": ["Williams' spent the majority of the 2004\u201305 season on the right wing with manager Neale Cooper preferring the partnership of Adam Boyd and Joel Porter up front.
