The reason for this delay was that he had to spend four years fighting manslaughter charges in Belgium for his alleged involvement in the Heysel Stadium disaster; he was finally found Not Guilty when his trial concluded in April 1989."]}, {"page": "Kevin Young (footballer)", "response": ["Young began his career as an apprentice at Burnley, turning professional under Harry Potts in May 1979 after making his league debut in the 1978\u201379 season. He made 27 appearances in the 1979\u201380 season, as the \"Clarets\" were relegated out of the Second Division under the stewardship of Brian Miller. During the 1980\u201381 campaign, he scored his first goal in the Football League on 16 September, in a 2\u20130 win over Hull City at Turf Moor, and also claimed goals in victories over Oxford United and Chester. He scored seven goals in 49 appearances in the 1981\u201382 season, as Burnley won promotion as Third Division champions. He scored two goals in 38 games in the 1982\u201383 season, as caretaker-manager Frank Casper failed to steer the club away from relegation. He featured just twice in the 1983\u201384 season, and it became apparent that he had no future at the club under new boss John Bond. In November 1983, he moved to Torquay United on loan, and scored one goal in three Fourth Division games for Bruce Rioch's \"Gulls\"; his spell at Plainmoor was brief. In December 1983, he moved on loan to Port Vale until the end of the season, becoming John Rudge's first signing as \"Valiants\" manager. Adding balance to the midfield, he scored four goals in 28 Third Division games. After returning to Burnley from Vale Park, he made a permanent transfer to Lancashire rivals Bury."]}, {"page": "Alistair Brown (footballer, born 1951)", "response": ["Brown played for Second Division Crystal Palace in 1983, before moving on to Alan Buckley's Walsall in the Third Division. He finished as the club's top scorer in 1983\u201384 with 15 goals, his only season at Fellows Park. In July 1984 he joined Port Vale, then in the Fourth Division under John Rudge's stewardship, making his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town at Vale Park on 25 August 1984. With 21 goals in 49 games in the 1984\u201385 season he became the club's top scorer, forming a deadly forward pairing with Robbie Earle. However the next season he struggled with injuries and retired from the game in May 1986, at the age of 35. His six goals in 33 games did though help the secure the \"Valiants\" the fourth automatic promotion place. Despite smoking cigarettes during the half-time break, his experience on the field helped to improve the goal-scoring skills of Robbie Earle and Andy Jones."]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["He made 38 appearances in the 1996\u201397 campaign, as the club posted their highest ever post-war finish, eighth in the second tier. He played 29 games in the 1997\u201398 and 32 games in 1998\u201399 seasons. In January 1999, manager John Rudge, who had signed Aspin ten years earlier, was replaced by Brian Horton. Aspin also left the club at the end of the season, with 410 league and cup appearances to his name, and enjoyed a testimonial featuring Vale supporting pop-star Robbie Williams.", "On 4 October 2017, Aspin was appointed as manager of former club Port Vale, who were 22nd in League Two after a poor start to the 2017\u201318 season; his former manager John Rudge also returned to the club in an advisory role. Aspin said that his new squad was too big with 33 senior professionals at the club, and added that he would try to find a formation to suit the players at his disposal and that he wanted the team to push further forward to support target-man striker Tom Pope. He picked up his first win as Vale manager on 14 October, with Pope scoring a brace in a 3\u20131 home win over Cheltenham Town. Seven days later, Aspin was named as manager of the week after his side won 1\u20130 away at Exeter City. He went on to be nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award after three wins in five games and five goals in the month of October. He signed a new two-and-a-half year contract with the club in December 2017. He was also nominated for that month's Manager of the Month award after collecting 13 points from Vale's five matches, including a 4\u20130 victory over league leaders Luton Town and a 1\u20130 win over promotion chasing Coventry City; however the award instead went to Danny Cowley at Lincoln City."]}, {"page": "Michael Walsh (footballer, born 1977)", "response": ["He signed for John Rudge's Port Vale in June 1998 for a fee of \u00a3100,000.

Walsh made 48 appearances in 2000\u201301, and went on to receive his only honour at the club in 2001, as he helped Vale to beat Brentford 2\u20131 in the Football League Trophy final at the Millennium Stadium. However his injury saga began not long after signing a new contract under Brian Horton in 2001 when Walsh underwent surgery, but by the end of the year he seemed to have recovered. However, by June 2003 another operation was needed to correct a shoulder injury. After this latest procedure he picked up an abdominal strain, though he again slowly began to recover. By November of that year he was injured again, this time because of his back, he required a series of injections and again consulted a surgeon. By February 2004 he was on the road to recovery, but the next month picked up a neck injury in a collision with Barnsley's Chris Shuker, meaning another operation."]}, {"page": "Darren Beckford", "response": ["In all he played 214 games and scored 81 times for John Rudge's side. He was sold to Norwich City in June 1991. The fee that Norwich paid for him \u2013 \u00a3925,000 \u2013 was set by a Football League tribunal (Vale had wanted \u00a31.5 million) and was a club record that stood until 1994. \u00a3200,000 of the sum went to Manchester City. Vale signed his brother Jason to replace him, though he could not replicate his elder sibling's success."]}, {"page": "Arjan van Heusden", "response": ["Van Heusden began his career in his native Netherlands with VV Noordwijk, moving to England in December 1993 for a trial with Port Vale, signing permanently in May 1994 for a fee of \u00a34,500.

A man of discipline, within his first fortnight with the club he had levied two fines. He demanded dedication and effort from his players and managed to steady the ship at Vale Park following brief and unsuccessful reigns from rookie managers Dennis Butler and Alan Bloor, stating that \"the holiday is over\". The \"Valiants\" had flat-lined, and finished fifth-from-bottom in the Fourth Division in 1979\u201380, outside of the re-election zone on goals scored. He appointed John Rudge as his assistant on a recommendation. McGrath offloaded many under-performing players, transfer-listing fifteen of them, and signed goalkeeper Mark Harrison and defender Lee Harwood from Southampton.", "The following season, however, McGrath was in conflict with chairman Jim Lloyd, who instructed him to speak to the press only on team matters; numerous players also were disgruntled over contract issues.What If There Had Been No Port in the Vale?: Startling Port Vale Stories! (Witan Books, 2011, ) By December 1983, Vale were three points adrift at the foot of the Third Division and McGrath was sacked. McGrath had made some poor choices during his final months at the club, signing Ireland international striker Eamonn O'Keefe from Wigan Athletic for \u00a310,000 only to play him in midfield, and allowing player unrest to fester as several rejected new contracts and four stayed at the club on weekly contracts \u2013 this was despite Vale paying the third-highest wage bill in the division (\u00a39,000 a week). He also offloaded top-scorer Bob Newton to Chesterfield in exchange for Martin Henderson, who was not a success. McGrath retained the support of the fans however, who criticised the board for their decision to sack him. His assistant, John Rudge, was appointed as manager and failed to avoid relegation, though would take the club to great success in a sixteen-year spell at the club.", "During his time at Vale Park he made some unorthodox decisions; such as putting fifteen players on the transfer list at once, taking the team for a swim at Blackpool, and one time sending assistant manager John Rudge hundreds of miles on a scouting mission, only to rip up the report in the dressing room, declaring to his players that 'It's not about them, it's about us!'", "In 1986, Preston North End came calling. The once proud club was on its knees and after ending the 1985\u201386 season in 91st position (in the Football League) they needed some new blood and new ideas. McGrath was just the man for the job, although he was not the board's not first choice, with Preston courting the services of Tranmere manager Johnny King and his successor at Port Vale John Rudge, before settling on McGrath."]}]}}
