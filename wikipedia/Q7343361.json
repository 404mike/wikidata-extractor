Through the influence of his great-uncle General William Dyott, on 25 October 1827 he was appointed an ensign in the British Army's 63rd Regiment of Foot. In February 1829 Dale embarked for Western Australia on HMS Sulphur as part of a detachment of troops commanded by Captain Frederick Chidley Irwin.  On arrival at the colony, he was seconded as an assistant to Surveyor General John Septimus Roe, whose Survey Department was suffering under an extreme workload.  Dale spent four years with the Survey Department, surveying, clearing roads and exploring.  He was the first European to cross the Darling Range, where he discovered the fertile Avon Valley and explored the future locations of Northam, Toodyay and York.  He was also the first European to see and describe the numbat.In November 1832 Dale purchased a vacated lieutenancy, but the following year returned to England.  He took with him the smoked head of Yagan, a Noongar Aboriginal who had been ambushed and killed by a young settler. He remained on leave until he sold his commission in 1835. The sale of his commission, along with \u00a3500 inherited from his grandfather, who had died in January 1835, enabled Dale to set himself up as a timber merchant in Liverpool in November 1835. He became involved in promoting the use of the Western Australian timber jarrah.  He died of tuberculosis in Bath on 20 July 1853.Mount Dale, one of the highest points in the Darling Range, to the south of Mundaring Weir, is named after him. The Dale River, a tributary of the Avon River, is also named after him, as is Ensign Dale Place in Northam, Western Australia.\n\nThe Panoramic View of King George's Sound, Part of the Colony of Swan River, a 2.7-metre-long (9 ft) hand-coloured aquatint panorama of Albany after sketches by Dale, was published in 1834 by Robert Havell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darling Scarp", "response": ["The earliest traverses by British settlers in the Swan River Colony occurred in the 1830s.

It was discovered by an exploration party exploring the Avon Valley under the leadership of Robert Dale.

According to the historian Paul Turnbull, Dale appears to have persuaded Irwin to let him have the head as an \"anthropological curiosity\". After arriving in London, Dale tried to sell the head to scientists, approaching a number of anatomists and phrenologists. His price of \u00a320 failed to find a buyer, so he made an agreement with Thomas Pettigrew for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months. Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian, was well known in the London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and autopsied ancient Egyptian mummies. He displayed the head on a table in front of a panoramic view of King George Sound reproduced from Dale's sketches. For effect, the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the red-tailed black cockatoo."]}, {"page": "Northam, Western Australia", "response": ["The area around Northam was first explored in 1830 by a party of colonists led by Ensign Robert Dale, and subsequently founded in 1833. It was named by Governor Stirling, probably after a village of the same name in Devon, England. Almost immediately it became a point of departure for explorers and settlers who were interested in the lands which lay to the east."]}, {"page": "Toodyay, Western Australia", "response": ["The Avon River valley in which Toodyay was to be located was discovered for the white settlers by Ensign Robert Dale in 1830, leading to further exploration by settlers including James Drummond, Captain Francis Whitfield and Alexander Anderson.

Drummond established his homestead Hawthornden a few kilometres to the north."]}, {"page": "Stirling Range", "response": ["Alexander Collie explored to the north of the Sound in 1831. On 29 April, he described the Stirling Range and recorded names for the main peaks.  The following year, Robert Dale led an expedition to the Range. On 24 January 1832, he made the first recorded ascent of a peak in the Stirling Range, scaling Toolbrunup.  Late in 1835, Governor James Stirling and John Septimus Roe led an expedition from Albany to Perth. They first saw the Stirling Range on 3 November, and on travelling closer to them the following day, Roe gave them their name. Because Stirling personally led the Pinjarra massacre and later threatened the Noongar people with genocide, there are some calls to rename the Stirling Range."]}, {"page": "King George Sound (Western Australia)", "response": ["In 1834 Robert Dale published in London a panorama print of the view from Mount Clarence accompanied by a pamphlet describing the sound and the geography, geology, flora, fauna and native inhabitants of the immediate region."]}, {"page": "Greenmount, Western Australia", "response": ["Ensign Robert Dale reached the summit on 18 October 1829.

He then learned that William Mackie had been appointed Chairman of the Courts of Petty and Quarter Sessions in the previous December, effectively eliminating any chances of an official judicial appointment for Moore.  He therefore turned his attention to the problems of obtaining his land grant and establishing a farm.  By the end of November, Moore had claimed a large area of land in the Avon Valley, which he had not yet seen but had been highly recommended by Robert Dale, who had explored the area in July.  Moore also obtained half of William Lamb's grant in Upper Swan by agreeing to undertake the improvements necessary to secure the entire title.", "In September 1831, Robert Dale led a large party in cutting a road from Guildford to the Avon Valley.  Eager to see his grant for the first time, Moore joined the party.  On arriving at the intended site for the town of York, Moore and Dale explored much of the Avon River, correctly guessing that the Avon and the Swan were in fact the same river.  The information Moore gathered on this expedition guided him in relocating his inland grant to an area with vastly better pasture land."]}, {"page": "York, Western Australia", "response": ["Ensign Robert Dale, a 20-year-old officer of the 63rd Regiment, led a small party in the first exploratory journey over the Darling Range, during the winter months of 1830 into what was later to be known as the Avon Valley.", "*Robert Dale (1810\u20131853), the first European to cross the Darling Range, where he discovered the fertile Avon Valley and explored the future locations of Northam, Toodyay and York."]}, {"page": "Beverley, Western Australia", "response": ["The town is believed to be named after Beverley in Yorkshire, from where some of the earliest explorers of the Avon valley originated, including Colonial Surgeon Charles Simmons, an early landowner in the district.

A large corroboree was recorded there in 1841. Today there are no registered Aboriginal sites within the Gwambygine farm property, but the Avon River and the Pool do have mythological significance.

They established their farms on  fronting the Swan River, at what is now known as Maylands, and called it the Peninsula. During this time either Michael or James joined Robert Dale, who was charged by Governor James Stirling to lead a party to explore the country east of the Darling Range. The party left in late 1830, and found and named the Avon River flowing through good pastoral country. The townsites of Beverley, York and Northam were marked out and the land opened for selection. Among the first claimants for land grants were Joseph Hardey and the Clarkson brothers.
