For four days and nights by skilful disposition he held the position under heavy fire of all kinds and against several counterattacks. Although short of supplies and ammunition, his determination never wavered and when the enemy attacked in greatly superior numbers and had almost ejected our troops from the redoubt, he personally led a counter-attack which finally cleared the enemy out of the southern and western faces.He later transferred to the Army Education Corps and achieved the rank of colonel. He wrote a history of the corps, published in 1963.His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Green Howards Museum in Richmond, North Yorkshire, England.  A book on his life and that of his schoolfriend and fellow VC Donald Simpson Bell called 'A Breed Apart' by Richard Leake was published by Great North Publishing in 2008.  \"The story of White and Bell deserves to be known by a wider audience.  To have two school friends both awarded the VC on the same battlefield is probably unique in British military history,\" said Richard Leake.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Green Howards", "response": ["* Captain Archie Cecil Thomas White, VC MC (27 September\u00a0\u2013 1 October 1916)"]}, {"page": "Royal Army Educational Corps", "response": ["Two Army Educational Corps officers won the Victoria Cross in the First World War: Archie Cecil Thomas White and James Lennox Dawson."]}, {"page": "Educational and Training Services Branch", "response": ["*Archie Cecil Thomas White VC after serving as a captain in the Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment) transferred to the Army Education Corps and reached the rank of Colonel to serve as Command Education Officer Home Forces from November 1940 to August 1943."]}, {"page": "Archie Cecil White", "response": ["#REDIRECT Archie Cecil Thomas White"]}, {"page": "Archie C.
