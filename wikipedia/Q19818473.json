Kay  is a British-born chronobiologist who mainly works in the United States. Dr. Kay has pioneered methods to monitor daily gene expression in real time and characterized circadian gene expression in plants, flies and mammals. In 2014, Steve Kay celebrated 25 years of successful chronobiology research at the Kaylab 25 Symposium, joined by over one hundred researchers with whom he had collaborated with or mentored. Dr. Kay, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., briefly served as president of The Scripps Research Institute. and is currently a professor at the University of Southern California.

He was inspired to study chronobiology by Joseph Takahashi in the fall of 1992 after learning about the Drosophila clock in a lecture. In 1999 Hogenesch completed a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at Northwestern University's Chicago campus, studying transcription factors with basic helix-loop-helix (BHLH) and PAS protein domains. Hogenesh was mentored by Chris Bradfield, now a professor of oncology and the Director of the Molecular and Environmental Toxicology Graduate Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He continued his research on functional genomics as a postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Steve A. Kay at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation.", "Later in 1999, he became a postdoctoral associate with Steve A. Kay and Peter G. Schultz. Kay was employed by the University of California at San Diego and the Scripps Research Institute, while Schultz was employed at the Scripps Research Institute and was founder and director of The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) in La Jolla, CA.

Repressed in the dark by other proteins, CCA1\u2019s expression is activated when light is sensed by the phytochrome in the plant. After translation, the CCA1 protein needs to be phosphorylated by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2). This phosphorylation is necessary for the protein to form a homodimer and to bind to its target promoters. Hyperphosphorylation, due to the overexpression of CK2, will lead to altered circadian rhythms in the mutants where CCA1 showed shorter mRNA circadian oscillation than in wild-type plants.Xavier, Daniel, and Shoji Sugano. \"CK2 phosphorylation of CCA1 is necessary for its circadian oscillator function in Arabidopsis\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Vol. 101. 3292-3297 CK2 overexpression is significant in demonstrating CCA1 is part of the clock. The protein motif CCA1 uses to bind to its target DNA sequences is its Myb-like domain. CCA1 only has one Myb domain, whereas other plant and mammalian proteins could have multiple Myb domains. The presence of only one Myb domain in CCA1 shows its importance influence in the circadian clock. LUX is also an important Myb transcription factor that is necessary for CCA/LHY transcription. This can also help account for problems in the repressilator model described below.Samuel P. Hazen, Thomas F. Schultz, Jose L. Pruneda-Paz, Justin O. Borevitz, Joseph R. Ecker, and Steve A. Kay. LUX ARRHYTHMO encodes a Myb domain protein essential for circadian rhythms.

CCA1 acts to suppress the expression of the DNA sequence it binds to. The stability of CCA1 protein is not affected by light or dark. It is regulated by its proteasome. Inhibiting proteasome function leads to a circadian rhythm with a longer period.Kangisser, Shlomit, Esther Yakir, and Rachel M. Green. \"Proteasomal regulation of the CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) stability is part of the complex control of CCA1\" Plant Signaling & Behavior Vol. Volume 8, Issue 3.
