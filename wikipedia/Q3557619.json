While at school he played for England Under 18s.  He went on to the University of Birmingham to study Chemical engineering.   While at university he played for Moseley.  He went on to St Anne's College, Oxford where he was selected to play for the University of Oxford RFC and achieved his Blue.  After leaving Oxford he joined Bath Rugby. He started for Bath in the victorious 1998 Heineken Cup Final as they defeated Brive.  In 1992 he became a prop for the England national rugby union team where he remained until 1999.\nCombining the size and strength typical of a prop with unusual speed for a player specializing in this position, Ubogu was often a highly effective ball-carrier in broken play. Against well-drilled international defences he sometimes lacked penetration, but he frequently embarrassed club-level opposition.Ubogo founded the \"Shoeless Joe's\" chain of sports bars.In 2001, Ubogu appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank.Since 2004 he has run a successful, high-end travel and sporting hospitality company, using his initials as its name.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jonathan Edwards (triple jumper)", "response": ["Edwards was born in Westminster, London and attended West Buckland School in Devon where his potential for the triple jump was spotted at an early age.

Contemporaries with Edwards at West Buckland School included Victor Ubogu and Steve Ojomoh, both former Bath and England Rugby international players. Edwards now has a Sports Hall at West Buckland named after him, The Jonathan Edwards Sports Centre.

There was much speculation amongst many established England players as to what changes the new coach would bring to the England setup, particularly one with such close ties to a successful Bath Rugby Club. Rowell claimed he would rid England of the cautious, forward-dominated 10-man game which had done so well for them earlier in the decade, and play running rugby more similar to Bath's. Leonard kept his place in the England team, which now included several new players such as Mike Catt, Ben Clarke, Victor Ubogu, Steve Ojomoh (all Bath players) and Tim Rodber. In the 1995 Five Nations, Leonard won a record (for a prop) 38th cap for England, playing against Scotland, and the victory meant his third Grand Slam."]}, {"page": "Fort Boyard (game show)", "response": ["Series 3 aired two celebrity editions of Fort Boyard following the success of the 1999 special; broadcast on 5 January and 25 August 2001, one edition featured Rhodri Williams, Lisa Rogers, \"Handy\" Andy Kane, Tricia Penrose and Phil Gayle as the contestants.

One notable variant in 2001 saw the regulars feeling an animal, having been shown a clip of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson on Italian television trying to identify animals by touch alone. David Gower and Jonathan Ross correctly guessed their animal (a zebra) but Gary Lineker and Rory McGrath failed to get theirs (an alligator \u2013 they failed to even touch it), with McGrath and Lineker removing their blindfolds and running off the set in panic. Occasionally, the guests get to play in lieu of one of the regulars; a notable example was Sharron Davies, when the sportsman was her then husband Derek Redmond, whom she recognised."]}]}}
