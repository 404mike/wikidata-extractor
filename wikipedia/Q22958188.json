Digby (n\u00e9e Kidd; 1900\u20131960) was a British artist.\nDigby was born in 1900 into the class of British colonial civil servants and engineers which by the time of her death in 1960 was fast disappearing. She came from a family where painting had been a leisure pursuit for many generations. Violet Digby and her two elder brothers were taught to draw and paint by their father William, who was a skilled draftsman, designer and engineer. Violet Digby took her talents back to India as the wife of Kenelm Digby. After Kenelm's death in 1944 she joined the community of artists in St Ives where she would remain until her suicide in 1960.\nShe exhibited her paintings regularly at the St Ives Society of Artists exhibitions, including the Festival of Britain Exhibition in 1951. Her paintings were accepted at the annual exhibitions of The Pastel Society, and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in London. She also put up exhibitions in Delhi and in Cornwall. Her paintings were accepted every year but one from 1950 to 1960 by the Paris Salon of the French Society of Artists. There is an archive of her work and papers held by the Simon Digby Memorial Charity in Jersey in the Channel Islands. The charity commissioned a biographical catalogue of her work which was published in 2015. The first major exhibition of her work since her death in 1960 takes place at the cultural wing of the Indian High Commission, the Nehru Centre, London in April 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Violet (given name)", "response": ["* Violet M.
