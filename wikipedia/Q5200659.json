He was active in the Liberal Party, and was elected to Liverpool City Council in 1962.  He focused on building the party's strength in the city, and served as Chairman of the Liberal Party nationally from 1972 for a year.  In 1974, the Liberals became the largest party in Liverpool, and Carr served for a year as leader of the council.Also in 1974, Carr involved himself in successful negotiations to release the Pentecostal minister David Hathaway from prison in Czechoslovakia, where he had been charged with distributing religious literature.  In 1975, he proposed the addition of \"Social Democrat\" to the Liberal Party's name, as he believed that this would appeal to both Labour Party and some Conservative Party voters.  This suggestion was not taken up until the 1988, when the Liberals merged with the Social Democratic Party.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liverpool City Council", "response": ["| Cyril Carr"]}, {"page": "Carr (name)", "response": ["*Cyril Carr (1926\u20131981), British politician"]}, {"page": "Chris Rennard, Baron Rennard", "response": ["Rennard was educated at the Liverpool Blue Coat School and gained a BA (Hons) Social Studies in 1982 from the University of Liverpool. From his early teens he was an active member of the Liberal Party. He began his political activism in Liverpool in the late 1970s, where he chaired the Liverpool University Liberals. He cites the early pioneers of community politics in Liverpool, including Cyril Carr, Trevor Jones and David Alton, as having had a major influence on him. Rennard was Deputy Chair of the Liverpool Liberal Party and organised many of the party's election campaigns in the 1980s, at a time when the Liberal Party controlled the City Council. The first successful parliamentary by-election campaign he worked on was the Liverpool Edge Hill by-election in March 1979, at which the party's candidate was David Alton. Rennard was Alton's agent when he successfully contested the newly created Liverpool Mossley Hill constituency in 1983 (after boundary changes) and helped to secure an excellent result there in a general election that saw a landslide Conservative victory nationally."]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Cyril Carr, Chairman of the Liberal Party, 1972\u201373, Leader of Liverpool City Council 1974\u201375."]}, {"page": "1973 Liverpool City Council election", "response": ["Leader of the Council and Chair of Policy and Finance Committee Cyril Carr"]}]}}
