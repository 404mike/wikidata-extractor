In 1898, he served in the United States Navy during the short Spanish\u2013American War.\nIn 1907, his management skills led to his recruitment by the UERL, which was struggling through a financial crisis that threatened its existence. He quickly integrated the company's management and used advertising and public relations to improve profits. As managing director of the UERL from 1910, he led the take-over of competing underground railway companies and bus and tram operations to form an integrated transport operation known as the Combine.\nHe was Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne from December 1916 to January 1920 and was President of the Board of Trade between December 1916 and May 1919, reorganising the board and establishing specialist departments for various industries. He returned to the UERL and then chaired it and its successor the LPTB during the organisation's greatest period of expansion between the two World Wars, making it a world-respected organisation considered an exemplar of the best form of public administration.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 8", "response": ["*1874 \u2013 Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield, English businessman and politician, President of the Board of Trade (d. 1948)"]}, {"page": "November 4", "response": ["*1948 \u2013 Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield, English businessman and politician, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (b. 1874)"]}, {"page": "1948", "response": ["** Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield, British-born American businessman (b. 1874)"]}, {"page": "1874", "response": ["* August 8 \u2013 Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield, British-American businessman (d. 1948)"]}]}}
