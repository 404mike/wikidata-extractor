Bought from Chelsea, where he had made just a handful of first team appearances, Barnard initially played on the left wing for City. However, manager Joe Jordan started to play him at left wing-back shortly after his move to the club, and before long, Barnard was a fully fledged left wing-back. His ability to run with the ball down the wing, overlap with Brian Tinnion and, of course, his free kicks had earnt him some plaudits. Barnard left the club soon after, to join Barnsley in the Premier League, so this partnership was never seen in a competitive City side.

He did not feature heavily at Ashton Gate and instead was loaned out to Port Vale in October 2004. The next month Swansea City manager Kenny Jackett was on the lookout for a quality winger, Goodfellow meanwhile was prepared to go out on loan to the League Two club. Jackett managed to persuade City to allow Goodfellow to join the \"Swans\" on loan. He impressed at the Welsh club and his loan spell was extended the following month. However, he was quickly recalled to Ashton Gate after a spate of injuries at the Bristol club. Soon after Swansea attempted to buy Goodfellow off City, however, City manager Brian Tinnion informed Goodfellow he still had a future at the club.
