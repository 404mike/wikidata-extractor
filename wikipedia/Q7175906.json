In 2009, he was named in the Team Sky+ HD track cycling team alongside names such as Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.In November 2012 it was announced that Mitchell was joining the British paralympic cycling squad as a pilot for the tandem events. Mitchell teamed up with Paralympic gold medallist and multiple world champion Neil Fachie for the 2013 British National Track Championships, where they were second in both the kilo time trial and the 200-metre flying start time trial for mixed blind/visually impaired competitors. In addition he scored a solo second place in the sprint, being defeated in the final by Jason Kenny.Fachie and Mitchell continued their partnership for the 2014 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Aguascalientes, Mexico. The pair won the gold medal in the tandem 1km time trial, and broke the world record set by Fachie and Barney Storey at the 2012 Paralympics by setting a time of 59.460 seconds, becoming the first tandem pairing to clock a sub-minute time for the kilo time trial. They subsequently won a second gold in the tandem sprint.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Peter Mitchell"]}, {"page": "Peter Mitchell", "response": ["* Peter Mitchell (Three Men and a Baby), from the film Three Men and a Baby and its sequel", "*Peter Mitchell (newsreader) (born 1960), Australian journalist", "*Peter Mitchell (photographer) (born 1943), British documentary photographer", "*Peter Mitchell (cyclist) (born 1990), British racing cyclist", "*Peter Mitchell (golfer) (born 1958), English golfer", "*Peter Mitchell-Thomson, 2nd Baron Selsdon (1913\u20131963), British peer and racing driver", "*Peter Mitchell (politician) (1824\u20131899), Canadian politician"]}, {"page": "British National Tandem Sprint Championships", "response": ["|2013 || London Dynamo/Sportcity VeloCraig MacLeanMatt Rotherham|| Ythan CC/Performance CCNeil FachiePeter Mitchell ||VC St RaphaelPeter Boyd Dave Heald", "|2014 || Yasumitsu Schlapp/Performance CCAnthony KappesPeter Mitchell || Brooks Cycles/Sportcity VeloPhilip HoultonThomas Rotherham  ||  Newport Velo Youth CyclingMatthew EllisIeuan Williams", "|2015 || Sportcity VeloMatt RotherhamThomas Rotherham  || Black LineNeil FachiePeter Mitchell ||VC St RaphaelBen ElliottAndrew Leveton"]}, {"page": "British National Team Sprint Championships", "response": ["| 2011 || North West Region AJason Kenny, Jason Queally, Chris Hoy  || North West Region BRoss Edgar, Peter Mitchell, David Daniell  || North West Region CKian Emadi, Philip Hindes, Liam Phillips ", "| 2012 || North West Region BDavid Daniell, Peter Mitchell, Lewis Oliva || City of Edinburgh RCBruce Croall, John Paul, Callum Skinner  || North West Region AMatthew Crampton, Jody Cundy, Craig MacLean ", "| 2014 ||North West RegionPhilip Hindes, Jason Kenny, Callum Skinner ||Sportcity Velo Jack Payne, Matt Rotherham, Thomas Rotherham ||Performance Cycle CoachingPeter Mitchell, Ryan Owens, Thomas Scammell", "| 2015||North West Region A Jason Kenny, Matthew Crampton, Philip HindesBNTC Results from Britishcycling.org.uk, 28 September 2015.  || Black LinePeter Mitchell, Matt Roper, Tom Scammell ||Sportcity Velo Jack Payne, Matt Rotherham, Tom Rotherham", "|2019 ||Team Inspired & SES RacingJack Carlin, Jason Kenny, Philip Hindes, Ryan Owens  ||SlingshotAlistair Fielding, Lewis Stewart, Hamish Turnbull||Black LinePeter Mitchell, Niall Monks, Matthew Roper, Alex Spratt"]}, {"page": "2008 UEC European Track Championships", "response": ["|Peter Mitchell||", "|Steven HillLuc JonesPeter Mitchell||46.435"]}, {"page": "2009 UEC European Track Championships", "response": ["|Jason KennyDavid DaniellPeter Mitchell||"]}, {"page": "Sky Track Cycling", "response": ["The team was launched in October 2008 with Hoy, Kenny, Pendleton, Staff, Ross Edgar and Shanaze Reade.
