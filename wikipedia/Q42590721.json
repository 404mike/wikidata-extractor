After working on the reconstruction of Windsor Castle to designs of Sir Jeffry Wyatville, he was employed by the Admiralty from 1838 to his retirement in 1867. Throughout his career of almost three decades, Scamp designed naval facilities in Britain, Malta, Gibraltar and Bermuda.\nScamp's early works from the 1840s include a dockyard and the Royal Naval Bakery in Malta. During his stay in Malta, he oversaw the construction of St Paul's Pro-Cathedral, making significant alterations to the building in the process. His most notable works in Britain were extensions of the Chatham and Portsmouth Dockyards carried out from the 1860s to the 1880s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 5", "response": ["*1801 \u2013 William Scamp, English architect and engineer (d. 1872)"]}, {"page": "January 13", "response": ["*1872 \u2013 William Scamp, English architect and engineer (b. 1801)"]}, {"page": "1801", "response": ["* June 5 \u2013 William Scamp, English architect and engineer (d. 1872)"]}, {"page": "1872", "response": ["* January 13 \u2013 William Scamp, English architect and engineer (b. 1801)"]}, {"page": "Scamp", "response": ["* William Scamp (1801\u20131872), English architect and engineer"]}, {"page": "1801 in architecture", "response": ["*June 5 \u2013 William Scamp, English architect working in Malta (died 1872)"]}, {"page": "1872 in architecture", "response": ["*January 13 \u2013 William Scamp, English architect (born 1801)"]}, {"page": "St Paul's Pro-Cathedral, Valletta", "response": ["The cathedral was commissioned by the Dowager Queen Adelaide during a visit to Malta in the 19th Century when she found out that there was no place of Anglican worship on the island.

Queen Adelaide laid the foundation stone on 20 March 1839 and her banner hangs above the choir stalls. The original plans were designed by Richard Lankasheer; however, the building proved unstable, thus work had to resume on plans by Scamp in 1841. Scamp's designs located the altar on the west side of the church, but the Bishop of Gibraltar had a more conservative view, thus the designs were altered and Scamp designed an apse inside the great doors to hold the sanctuary on the east side."]}, {"page": "Malta Maritime Museum", "response": ["The museum is housed in a large building on the Birgu waterfront which was formerly the Royal Naval Bakery.
