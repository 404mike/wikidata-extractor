He was also on the books of Torquay United, but without representing that club in league competition.Robinson spent six seasons with home-town club Darlington, and contributed to their promotion to the Second Division in 1925. In the club's second season at that level, he lost his place to Jimmy Waugh, the club's then record signing. When Robinson moved on to Southend United at the end of the season, after Darlington had been relegated back to the Third Division North, the Daily Express reported that he \"was thought to be unlucky to lose his place in the 'Quakers' side when Waugh was signed from Sheffield United and yet failed to save Darlington from relegation.\" He played little senior football after leaving Darlington.In August 1932, he returned to the club as assistant trainer.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Robinson", "response": ["* Billy Robinson (footballer, born 1925) (1925-1953), English footballer for Stockport County and Accrington Stanley", "* Billy Robinson (Australian footballer) (1890\u20131969), Australian rules footballer for Carlton", "* Billy Robinson (English footballer) (1903\u2013?), English football centre half for Darlington, Southend United and Carlisle United", "* Billy Robinson (1938\u20132014), British professional wrestler and trainer", "* Billy Robinson (aviator) (1884\u20131916), American aviator"]}, {"page": "Hughie Dickson", "response": ["In September 1924, a crowd of 5,000 saw Scottish club Raith Rovers, with former Darlington player Peter Bell in their team, visit Feethams for Dickson's benefit match.
