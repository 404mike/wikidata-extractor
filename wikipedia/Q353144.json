British historical biographer Robert Payne, in his book The Life and Death of Adolph Hitler (Praeger, 1973) believed that Hitler's diet was ascetic and deliberately fostered by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels to emphasize Hitler's self-control and total dedication to Germany. Rynn Berry\u2014an authority on vegetarian history\u2014supported the notion that Hitler's vegetarianism was \"a marketing scheme concocted by Nazi propagandists\" who wished to create a better public perception of Hitler, and was mostly due to health reasons rather than moral ones (noting his fondness for liver dumplings), concluding that \"Hitler was in no way an ethical vegetarian\"."]}, {"page": "The Bronze God of Rhodes", "response": ["Robert Payne in The Saturday Review deems the difficulty in setting a novel in the Hellenistic era \"to find a central character who will represent the quintessence of those times,\" a problem \"de Camp has brilliantly solved ... by choosing Chares of Lindos, ... a sympathetic character [with] the charm of a character in a good picaresque novel.\" He finds de Camp \"in his element\" in the Rhodian scenes, noting that \"[w]henver he writes of Greeks and purely Greek affairs, he writes masterfully,\" but considers \"[t]he Egyptian adventure ... pretty terrible.\"Payne, Robert. \"A Colossus Was Cast in Hellas.\" Review in The Saturday Review, Feb. 6, 1960, p. 18."]}, {"page": "1983 in poetry", "response": ["* February 18 \u2013 Robert Payne, 71 (born 1911), English professor of English literature in the U.S., lecturer in naval architecture, novelist, historian, poet and biographer"]}, {"page": "Mao Tse-tung: Ruler of Red China", "response": ["Mao Tse-tung: Ruler of Red China is a book written by Robert Payne and published by Henry Schuman, New York in 1950, shortly after Mao Zedong (here his name is transliterated as Mao Tse-tung) came to power.Also Secker and Warburg 1951  Fifteen years before the Cultural Revolution, Payne anticipated Mao's wider interests:"]}, {"page": "Robert Payne", "response": ["Robert Payne may refer to:", "*Robert Payne (agriculturalist) (died 1593), planter in Ireland", "*Robert Payne (Gloucester MP) (c. 1630 \u2013 1713), MP for Gloucester", "*Sir Robert Payne (Huntingdonshire MP) (1573\u20131631), MP for Huntingdonshire", "*Robert Payne (natural philosopher) (1596\u20131651), clergyman and natural philosopher", "*Robert Payne Smith (1818\u20131895), Anglican Dean of Canterbury", "*Robert Payne (author) (1911\u20131983), English novelist, historian and biographer"]}, {"page": "Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great", "response": ["* Robert Payne published a novel in 1954 about Alexander's life, Alexander the God (not to be confused with the Druon novel, below).Review: Alexander the God by Robert Payne.

He has been compared to other clerks from the \"natural school\" such as \"The Overcoat\"'s Akaky Akakievich. Although trying to use literature to understand life, Devushkin does not discuss these topics separately, and falsely believes that Dobroselova's letters reflect his life, taking short stories as realistic works. He exhibits typical sentimental characteristics; according to Robert Payne, Dostoyevsky \"writes on the edge of sentimentality, but he is a completely credible and rounded figure\". Devushkin's name derives from devushka, meaning maiden or girl, possibly symbolizing virginity and innocence, although Joseph Frank remarked it is an incongruent description.", "Belinsky and others saw The Overcoat as the inspiration for the novel. Later critics stated that the sentimental-humanitarian Poor Folk contained a great deal of parody and satire of Gogol books; however, there are some dissenters. Karin Jeanette Harmon guesses in \"Double Parody Equals Anti-Parody\" that Dostoyevsky mixes the parody of the sentimental epistolary novel with the parody of the naturalistic sketch of the clerk.  Robert Payne rejects the idea of any satiric content; he notes that satire began in The Double. A similar view was held by Belinsky, who also stated that \"Dostoyevsky's talent is\u00a0... not descriptive, but to the highest degree creative.\" Victor Terras thought that Dostoyevsky did not use satire except in a few cases, but instead employed a \"humor derived from the eternal conflict between the simple soul of a good man and the complex apparatus of the soulless, institutionalized society run by 'clever' people.\" Joseph Frank, who suggested that the whole work is a \"serious parody\", recalled that Poor Folk burlesques the \"high-society adventure novel, the Gogolian humorous local color-tale\" and \"the debunking physiological sketch\". Victor Terras dubbed it a \"travesty of the sentimental epistolary love story.\" The Contemporary stated \"In this work comedy is somehow explored and includes an appreciable tone, colour and even the language of Gogol and Kvitka\". \"Through his tale\", wrote The Northern Bee, \"Dostoyevsky wanted to utilize Gogol's humour with naive simplicity of the undisturbed Osnovyanenko [pen name of Kvitka].\"The Northern Bee, in Russian, 1846, vol. 25 Another perspective that describes the connection between Poor Folk and The Overcoat is the position that the former is considered the continuation of the latter, that Dostoevsky picked up where Gogol left off in his tale about poor civil servants. This view does not imply that Dostoevsky did not offer innovations since this novel also distinguished itself by humanizing those that that were \u2013 in Gogol's tale - mechanical and lifeless. This is aligned with the theory that Dostoevsky attempted \u2013 both in Poor Folk and The Double \u2013 to penetrate into the psychology of Gogol's characters. It is claimed that the result of Dostoevski's unequivocal humanization of the Gogolian model intensified its effect. Gogol's debonair portrayal of social-psychic frustrations is a case in point. Dostoevski took a different path by highlighting its tragic aspect."]}, {"page": "Pierre Stephen Robert Payne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Payne (author)"]}, {"page": "Richard Cargoe", "response": ["#Redirect Robert Payne (author)"]}, {"page": "Valentin Tikhonov", "response": ["#Redirect Robert Payne (author)"]}, {"page": "Howard Horne", "response": ["#Redirect Robert Payne (author)"]}, {"page": "John Anthony Devon", "response": ["#Redirect Robert Payne (author)"]}, {"page": "Ana Jak\u0161i\u0107", "response": ["* Robert Payne & Nikita Romanoff: Ivan the Terrible"]}]}}
