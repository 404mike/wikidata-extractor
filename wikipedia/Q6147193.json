Veteran Stuart Bimson had moved on, to Cambridge United, and youngster Paul Mayo was sold to Watford for an initial \u00a375,000, but the acquisitions of Jamie McCombe, Marcus Richardson, Gary Taylor-Fletcher, Francis Green and loanee Kevin Ellison meant that they finished in the play-off places. Lincoln were beaten by Huddersfield Town in the semi-finals."]}, {"page": "Simon Grayson", "response": ["On 20 February 2012, just five days after Lee Clark was dismissed as manager, Grayson became the new manager of League One club Huddersfield Town on a -year deal. His first game in charge of the Terriers was in their 2\u20130 home victory over Exeter City when both defender Jamie McCombe and leading striker Jordan Rhodes scoring he also introduced Icelandic midfielder Joey Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson to the squad for the first time all season. While remaining unbeaten, his next five games in charge proved to be mostly unspectacular, resulting in four draws against Stevenage, Bury, Rochdale and Colchester United also defeating Hartlepool United in a 1\u20130 home victory. The early pattern of these results remained similar to those of the previous manager, Lee Clark who managed a number of draws, which were held responsible for the Terrier's inability to cement a place in the automatic promotion spots. With 10 games remaining Town occupied 4th position in League One, contrary to the chairman Dean Hoyle's brief urging the club to reach one of the top two positions. On 26 May 2012, Grayson led Huddersfield to play-off victory over Sheffield United, gaining promotion to the Championship."]}, {"page": "Gareth McAuley", "response": ["However, when Dean West was dropped from the squad and club captain Paul Morgan sidelined with an injury, McAuley moved into central defence to partner Ben Futcher.

He was a regular starter for Preston during the opening months of the season and also played in the cup competitions as the team reached the third round of the League Cup before being eliminated by Southampton and progressed to the same stage of the Football League Trophy with penalty shoot-out victories over Morecambe and Rochdale. He was handed a one-match ban after receiving his fifth yellow card of the campaign in the FA Cup first round defeat to Southend United on 22 November 2011. Preston manager Phil Brown brought in Jamie McCombe on loan as cover for Carlisle, and the Huddersfield Town loanee kept his place in the starting line-up throughout December 2011. Carlisle returned to the Preston team for the visit to Rochdale on 2 January 2012, when he was selected to play alongside Craig Morgan by caretaker managers Graham Alexander and David Unsworth. He played five times during that month, scoring on his 27th and final appearance for the club in the 1\u20132 loss to Yeovil Town.
