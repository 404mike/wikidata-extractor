He was the sprint coach at Wasps Rugby Club for the 2015\u201316 season. He competed in the 100 metres and 200 metres, as well as the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay.\nCampbell was a promising junior athlete and won a number of medals at the World and European Junior Championships. He spent two years away from athletics, playing professional football but returned in 1995, attending his first Olympics shortly afterwards. He began to compete as part of the British 4 \u00d7 100 m relay team and between 1997 and 2000 he won two World Championship medals, a gold medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, and set the European record in the event. Success also came in the individual events: he became the 1998 European Champion in the 100 m and won his first Olympic medal, a silver in the 200 m at the 2000 Sydney Games. In the 100 m he won silver at the 2002 European Championships and was the 2003 World Championships bronze medallist.\nCampbell formed part of perhaps Britain's most successful relay team \u2013 they won in the European Cup in 1999 and 2000, at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and took the gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics (the first time a British team had done so since 1912). Campbell had also won a gold medal at the 2002 European Championships and a 2003 World Championship silver medal but had to return them when his running-mate, Dwain Chambers, tested positive for banned substances, sparking much animosity between the two. He won his last medal in 2006, again taking the relay gold at the European Championships, and he retired shortly afterwards. His personal bests of 10.04 s in the 100 m and 20.13 s in the 200 m were not prodigiously quick by elite global standards, but over his career he earned an impressive reputation as a 'championship' runner, saving his best for finals and collecting significantly more medals than his times alone would indicate.\nHe now works with various Premier League football clubs, working with the players to improve their sprinting ability. He also regularly visits schools to promote sport among children, on behalf of the Youth Sport Trust, and he also recently appeared as a VIP guest at Sheffield Hallam University's annual Sports Ball held at Ponds Forge International Sports Centre.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1973", "response": ["** Darren Campbell, British athlete"]}, {"page": "Linford Christie", "response": ["In the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay event Christie's performance as anchor, alongside Colin Jackson, Tony Jarrett and John Regis, set a European record of 37.77\u00a0s at the 1993 World Championships.

He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with a run of 10.03\u00a0s for third place and won a relay gold medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100\u00a0m semi finalist and set a games record as part of the 4\u00d7100\u00a0m relay team.'I thought I'd won' . Sports Illustrated (21 September 1998). Retrieved on 5 May 2009.Commonwealth Games Records . Commonwealth Games official website. Retrieved on 5 May 2009. His ability attracted the attention of former sprinter and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane, who became his coach. He came first in the 100\u00a0m in the 1999 European Cup, then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European sprinter (after Linford Christie) to break the ten second barrier with a time of 9.99\u00a0s. Fellow British sprinter Jason Gardener scored a time of 9.98\u00a0s in Lausanne soon after, becoming the third Briton to break the barrier. In spite of this, Chambers remained some distance behind his North American counterparts.", "With the 2000 Sydney Olympics approaching, Chambers studied the technique of other sprinters. In an interview with BBC journalist Tom Fordyce, Chambers commented on the stamina Greene and Surin had gained from running in the 200\u00a0metres event and Jason Gardener's improved acceleration through running the 60\u00a0metres event. He experimented with distances at the beginning of 2000, sprinting over 50, 60 and 200\u00a0m in various competitions. He set a personal best of 6.55\u00a0s in the 60\u00a0m event in Ghent in February. A hamstring injury caused him to miss six-weeks of training and when he returned his 100\u00a0m performances were lacklustre. He finished ninth at the Golden Gala in Rome with a slow time of 10.41\u00a0s and was seventh in a tame 10.30\u00a0s at the London Grand Prix, results that led him to consider quitting the season altogether. A late rejuvenation at the British Olympic trials guaranteed his selection as he snatched first place with 10.11\u00a0s (just one hundredth of a second ahead of Darren Campbell). Victory against in-form world record holder Maurice Greene in Gateshead raised Chambers' confidence and he stated his aim to take home a medal from the Games.", "His season's best came under unusual circumstances at the British Grand Prix \u2013 due to a system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96\u00a0s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100\u00a0m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within a split second of each other and Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4\u00d7100\u00a0m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team to beat him to the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, there was a sense of disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.", "After further investigation, it was revealed on 22 October 2003 that Chambers had tested positive for the banned steroid THG. Analysis of his backup sample also tested positive and the outcome was confirmed on 7 November 2003, making Chambers the first person to test positive for the new drug. Chambers was suspended the same day with an independent UK Athletics tribunal pending. The disciplinary hearing on 24 February 2004 resulted in a two-year ban from athletics, backdated to begin on 7 November 2003. He was also banned for life from the Olympics, and stripped of the medals he had won since mid-2002, after admitting that he had taken THG from that date. Chambers' 2002 relay gold medal performance was erased, costing teammates Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Christian Malcolm their medals in the process. Chambers was also ordered by the IAAF to pay back his earnings from the period of his athletics career that was affected by his drug abuse.", "Chambers lamented the effects of his drug use and noted the irony that the drugs did not do much to improve the consistency of his performances. On his return to international competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use: in the 100\u00a0m final at the 2006 European Championships, Chambers ran a sub-par 10.24\u00a0s and finished in fifth place. He was part of the gold medal-winning British 4\u00d7100\u00a0m team, but Darren Campbell, who was angry about losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers' ban, refused to join the team in a celebratory lap. After the competition, Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football, and completed a week-long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November.", "Chambers is the current European record holder in the 60\u00a0m with 6.42\u00a0s and is the fourth fastest sprinter in the history of the event after Christian Coleman Andre Cason, and Maurice Greene. Chambers shares the British and European records for the 4\u00d7100\u00a0metres relay with Gardener, Darren Campbell and Marlon Devonish with their 37.73\u00a0s finish at the 1999 Seville World Championships. It is also the fastest time recorded by a team outside of the IAAF's North, Central American and Caribbean region."]}, {"page": "Katharine Merry", "response": ["The following year she became World number One.

In doing so, Kenteris became the first white male to win a 200 m sprinting medal at the Olympics since Pietro Mennea achieved the feat, winning the 200 m gold at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.
