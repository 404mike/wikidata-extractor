We will work towards a Whyte rematch for early next year. It's a fight that I think boxing needs to see again.\" Chisora fought Croatian Robert Filipovic (4-2, 3 KOs) at the Echo Arena in Liverpool, on 30 September. Filipovic was a late replacement for Jay McFarlane (3-3, 2 KOs). The fight was scheduled for 6 and ended in round 5 when the referee had seen enough, giving Chisora the win via TKO.
