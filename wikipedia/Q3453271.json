However, he missed the team's 1879 F.A. Cup final triumph through injury.Also in 1879, Anderson made his sole appearance for the England team, playing in goal (his usual position being that of a forward) against Wales. The match was hampered by snowy conditions and the game was reduced to just sixty minutes of play. The game ended 2-1 to England.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Old Etonians F.C.", "response": ["*Rupert Anderson (1 cap)"]}, {"page": "Anderson (surname)", "response": ["*Rupert Anderson (1859\u20131944), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1850s in association football", "response": ["* 29 April \u2013 Rupert Anderson (d. 1944), England international goalkeeper for one match in 1879."]}, {"page": "Lindsay Bury", "response": ["He later emigrated to Florida where he became an orange planter, possibly in association with his former Eton College and Cambridge University compatriot Rupert Anderson who had gone to Florida at the same time."]}, {"page": "Rupert Darnley Anderson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rupert Anderson"]}]}}
