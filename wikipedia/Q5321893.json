Her father died in 1917 and she and her sister moved away from Gilling, eventually settling in Staines (where Ranjitsinhji had a house). According to cricket writer E. H. D. Sewell, to whom Ranjitsinhji told the story, Ranjitsinhji asked Edith to marry him following her father's death. However, she refused as she had fallen in love with someone else, and the engagement ended after 18 years. Sewell also claimed that her father had come to approve of the proposed marriage. However, the story may not be reliable and Simon Wilde speculates that Borrisow had simply tired of waiting and broke off the engagement. It is likely the pair remained friends, but Ranjitsinhji was deeply affected by the end of the relationship."]}, {"page": "Dave Gallaher", "response": ["Paul Verdon, in his history of All Black captains, Born to Lead, writes: \"The overwhelming evidence suggests Gallaher's leadership style, honed from time spent in the Boer War, was very effective.\" Gallaher's biographer Matt Elliott asserts that in the century since his playing retirement \"his reputation as a player and leader have only enhanced\". According to historian Terry McLean: \"In a long experience of reading and hearing about the man, one has never encountered, from the New Zealand angle, or from his fellow players, criticism of his qualities as a leader.\" In the view of the English rugby journalist E. H. D. Sewell, writing soon after Gallaher's death, the New Zealand captain was \"a very quiet, taciturn sort of cove, who spoke rarely about football or his own achievements\u00a0...

Other West Indians looked to follow his example, and several were approached by English counties with a view to qualifying. At least one of Ollivierre's Derbyshire colleagues was unhappy playing alongside a black cricketer; Bill Storer, according to the cricket writer E. H. D. Sewell, believed in \"England for the English\" and specifically objected to presence of black people.Quoted in  However, there is no evidence that Ollivierre experienced any difficulties from spectators, and the historian Jack Williams suggests that despite racism inherent in English cricket at the time, Ollivierre's presence may have \"created goodwill towards non-whites among [Derbyshire's] white supporters\"."]}, {"page": "Johnny Williams (rugby union, born 1882)", "response": ["A month later, on 1 January 1907, Cardiff played hosts to the South Africans and beat the visitors 17\u20130 in front of 30,000 spectators. Heavy rain turned the ground into a \"quagmire\", and a strong wind blew from one end to the other. Cardiff won the toss and opted to play with the wind. Williams' first touch of the ball was erratic, failing to hold on to a catch in the initial stages, when he had a clear run to the tryline. After Cardiff had scored two tries in the first half with no response from the Springboks, Williams had another chance to score, but again fumbled the ball. At half time, Cardiff was leading by 11 points, already the largest score against the South Africans in any of the tour matches. Well into the second half, Williams received a pass from Rhys Gabe. Between him and the tryline was Marsberg, the opposition fullback, and \"one of the most magnificent tacklers\" to have played in Wales. Williams approached Marsberg and, with a swerving run, \"diddled\" him, and scored a try in the corner. Marsberg then ran up to him and shook him by the hand in recognition of the move. The contemporary rugby journalist E. H. D. Sewell commented that the try he scored \"against the South Africans for Cardiff will never be forgotten by those that witnessed it.\""]}, {"page": "David Bedell-Sivright", "response": ["Writing in 1919, rugby journalist and author E.

It was in 1908 that he earned his first cap for , against Ireland, on 29 February 1908. He was selected a second time for Scotland, to play against  at Inverleith on 6 February 1909.

England took an early lead, when Tarr put Mobbs in for a try in the opening stages. That try has been described by his contemporary, rugby journalist and author E. H. D.
