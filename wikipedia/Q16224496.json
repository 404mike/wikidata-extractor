England were forced into a late change for the tournament during this series, when Susie Rowe fractured her thumb and was replaced by the uncapped Amy Jones. England were grouped with Australia, India and Pakistan in Group A, following their group stage exit in the previous World Twenty20.", "Following on from the disappointment of not winning the world Twenty20, England headed to India for the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, defending their 2009 title. England added Georgia Elwiss to their squad from the World Twenty20, and were in Group A with Sri Lanka, West Indies and hosts India. England's tournament got off to a disastrous start, losing a thrilling match to the unfancied Sri Lanka. Sarah Taylor, Laura Marsh and Anya Shrubsole all missed the game injured, and Sri Lanka won the toss and inserted England to bat. The toss would prove crucial many times in this tournament, as the early start times meant that batting during the first hour was extremely difficult, and so it proved in this match, with Charlotte Edwards, Danielle Wyatt and Lydia Greenway all out within the first eight overs. Arran Brindle (31) and Heather Knight (38) lead the recovery, but as soon as England had gained the ascendancy they were both dismissed. It was left to vice-captain Jenny Gunn and debutant Amy Jones to get England to a defendable score, and they did, with Gunn making 52 and Jones 41. Some late hitting from Katherine Brunt and Danielle Hazell lifted England to 238\u20138, and it seemed as though the disaster the early wickets had promised had been averted. Sri Lanka however pulled off a stunning victory, Chamari Atapattu scoring 62, and supported by Mendis and Siriwardene, put Sri Lanka in an extremely strong position. Brunt and Elwiss struck back for England, before a brutal 56 from Eshani Lokusuriyage took Sri Lanka to within a run of victory. She was run out in the final over, but Dilani Manodara hit the final ball of the match from Elwiss for six as Sri Lanka won by just one wicket, their first every victory over England.", "| Amy Jones ||  || Right-handed bat || \u2014 || Central Sparks || 2 || 50 || 57 || 40 || Central", "| 8 || Amy Jones || 2013\u2013 || 63 || 52 || 927 || 20.60 || 89 || 120.07 || 5 || 0 || 109 || 13", "| 8 || Amy Jones || 89 || 52 || 11 || 3 || 171.15 || Pakistan || 19 December 2019"]}, {"page": "John Willmott School", "response": ["* Amy Jones - English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Western Australia women's cricket team", "response": ["* Amy Jones (2013)"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire Women cricket team", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|\u2013|| Amy Jones\u00a0 || style=\"text-align:center\"| ||  || Right-handed || \u2013 ||", "* Amy Jones (2013)"]}, {"page": "Fran Wilson", "response": ["In April 2015, she was named as one of the England women's Academy squad tour to Dubai, where England women will play their Australian counterparts in two 50-over games, and two Twenty20 matches.
