He was rich, successful and at the top of the gangster hierarchy when his son Jason died of a heroin overdose in 1992, at the age of 21. This tragedy led to Grimes becoming a police informer with the aim of bringing down the drug dealers who he felt had destroyed his son's life. His evidence has led to successful prosecutions against high-profile dealers such as John Haase and Curtis Warren.
