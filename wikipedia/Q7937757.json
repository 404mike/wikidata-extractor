Murray was said to be a strong supporter of Lloyd George's government. The Asquithians gave their backing to Vivian Phillipps, Asquith's private secretary. A third name was also under consideration, that of Sir John Fleming, an ex-Provost of Aberdeen.The Times, 16 March 1917 p6 Fleming may well have been seen as a good compromise candidate, as, following the intervention of the prime minister himself, Murray was persuaded to withdraw from the contest and Fleming was formally selected.The Times, 21 March 1917 p5"]}]}}
