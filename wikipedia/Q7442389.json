In a July 2005 interview with The Observer, Herbert spoke frankly of the responsibilities and difficulties in managing a historic home and estate. He wanted to increase the number of celebrity events, such as Madonna's birthday party, at Wilton House to increase revenues; however, opening the property to more tourists does not pay in the long run, he said, as it increases wear-and-tear on the house. He also spoke frankly of the need for him to marry and father a son to secure the succession (for the sake of his immediate family as well as the estate and house and all those who depend on it for a livelihood). His heir presumptive at that time was the present George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon (born 1956), who has legitimate male issue."]}, {"page": "Old Bryanstonians", "response": ["* Sebastian Conran (born 1956), designer"]}, {"page": "Alex McDowell", "response": ["McDowell wanted to become a painter from an early age, and studied fine art at the Central School of Art and Design in London where in 1975 he and Sebastian Conran staged the Sex Pistols first headline concert.
