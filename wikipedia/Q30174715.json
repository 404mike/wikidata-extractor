On Twitter, she denied calling the flag racist or calling for it to be banned, and in her Commons maiden speech, said that her comments \"had been taken out of proportion\", and that she had received \"many abusive messages\" over the issue. The controversy was the subject of a question in Prime Minister's Questions, in which Theresa May defended the flag, saying \"The Black Country remains a great place to do business, and I'd like to congratulate Gracie on designing that flag at the age of only 12 years. And I have to say that I am sure that she and others, including the Express & Star, have been surprised at the attitude from the benches opposite on this particular issue\". In 2018, a United Kingdom Independence Party supporter from Castlecroft (an area in Smith's constituency) was given a nine-week suspended prison sentence for sending racist and threatening emails to several MPs, including Smith, in which he told her to be put on \"the first banana boat\" to \"the jungle clearing you came from\".
