He found the heat and altitude at Guadalajara, Mexico difficult to cope with. The team's efforts at acclimatisation were not helped when Bobby Moore was falsely accused of stealing the infamous \"Bogot\u00e1 Bracelet\". Despite this, a Geoff Hurst goal was enough to beat their first opponents, Romania. A far tougher test awaited on 7 June, when England faced Brazil.

Milan and Barcelona, though the team was eventually knocked out in the semi-final, as they were in the FA Cup for the second consecutive year. The signing of Alex Stepney at the end of that season briefly threatened his position as Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper, and he considered putting in a transfer request, but Stepney ultimately made only one appearance for the club and was sold to Manchester United a few months later. Chelsea eventually reached an FA Cup final in 1967, where they faced Tottenham Hotspur, but the team got outplayed on the day and Bonetti could do little to stop Spurs winning 2\u20131."]}, {"page": "Mitcham", "response": ["*Alex Stepney \u2013 former Manchester United footballer and 1968 European Cup winner"]}, {"page": "Peter Shilton", "response": ["Despite playing at a lower level, he impressed England manager Alf Ramsey sufficiently to give him his debut against East Germany in November 1970. England won 3\u20131. Little more than six months later, Leicester were promoted back to the First Division. His second England cap came in a goalless draw against Wales at Wembley; and his first competitive match for his country was his third appearance as England drew 1\u20131 with Switzerland in a qualifying game for the 1972 European Championships. At this stage, Banks was still England's first choice keeper, but the remaining brace of back-ups from the 1970 World Cup, Peter Bonetti and Alex Stepney, had been cast aside by Ramsey so Shilton could begin to regard himself as his country's number two goalkeeper at the age of 22. His fourth and fifth England caps came towards the end of 1972, before a tragic incident suddenly saw Shilton propelled into the limelight as England's number one keeper. In October 1972, Gordon Banks was involved in a car crash which resulted in the loss of the sight in one eye and thus ended his career. Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence was called up to make his debut a month later for England's opening qualifier for the 1974 World Cup, (a 1\u20130 win over Wales).

After disposing of Maltese Hibernians, United advanced past Yugoslavian Sarajevo with a 2\u20131 home win \u2013 Best assisted John Aston for the first and scored the second himself, and was described by Geoffrey Green of The Times as \"the centrepiece of the chessboard\u00a0... a player full of fantasy; a player who lent magic to what might have been whimsy\". In the quarter-finals United advanced past Polish club G\u00f3rnik Zabrze 2\u20131 on aggregate, having held on to their aggregate lead in freezing temperatures in front of 105,000 at Silesian Stadium; despite losing the away tie 1\u20130, Best described the defeat as \"one of our best-ever performances, given all the unwelcome circumstances\". Facing six times champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals, Best scored the only goal of the home fixture with a 15-yard strike that Alex Stepney described as one of Best's finest goals. In the tie at the Bernab\u00e9u, Best was marked effectively by Manuel Sanch\u00eds Mart\u00ednez, but on the one time Best got the better of him he made a telling cross to Bill Foulkes, who calmly found the net to level the game at 3\u20133 and to win the aggregate tie 4\u20133.", "In an interview, Manchester United's Alex Stepney said, \"Best would knock the ball on to the goalkeeper's shin, who would be rushing towards this feet to close down the angle, and the ball would bounce back to him and he would score.

This was thanks largely to managers Billy Gray, who laid the foundations, and Benny Fenton, a former player who continued to build on Gray's side. All the players, which included winger Barry Rowan, goalkeeper Alex Stepney and strikers Hugh Curran and Len Julians, were presented with a commemorative gold cigarette lighter by the Football Association.

Stiles played well without keeping Eus\u00e9bio wholly quiet, and with the score at 1\u20131 and just a few minutes left, the Portuguese legend got away from the United defence with just goalkeeper Alex Stepney to beat, yet only managed to slam the ball straight into Stepney's midriff.

Eventually Greenhoff was moved back into his preferred centre half position - by accident, according to Docherty, as his team were chasing a goal in a cup tie - and the modern United centre half was born. Disappointment in the 1976 FA Cup Final, where the image of a tearful Greenhoff being consoled by his manager became an iconic one, was followed by the best season of the player's career in 1976\u201377. A man of the match performance against Ajax in the UEFA Cup came in a strong start to the season, where he also became a regular at the heart of the defence in the England national team.
