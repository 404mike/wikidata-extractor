There are exceptions to this: \"Waterlily\" \u2014 the tale of a man whose lover is killed during the war in Yugoslavia, based on the book Cold Night Lullaby by Colin Mackay \u2014 offers no such comfort. \"Only One Way\", on the other hand, is an upbeat song with a strong political theme and some biting humour."]}, {"page": "List of atheist authors", "response": ["* Colin Mackay (1951\u20132003): British poet and novelist.\"There was grim humour in such careful planning.
