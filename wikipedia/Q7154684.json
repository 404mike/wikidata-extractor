She won a gold medal in the 3000 metres at the 1978 Commonwealth Games, and on 13 September 1981 she set the world record for the 5000 metres with 15.14.51, the first recognised women's 5000m world record by the IAAF. This record remained the British record until 1985 when it was broken by Zola Budd. She also won a bronze medal in the 3000 metres at the 1982 European Indoor Championships.\nFudge made her marathon debut at the 1985 Columbus Marathon, winning in a time of 2:35:10. She then won a team gold medal at the 1985 World 15km Road Race Championships, and finished fifth individually. She improved her marathon personal best to 2:32:25 at the 1986 London Marathon. After the withdrawals of her twin sister Ann Ford and Priscilla Welch due to injury, and Veronique Marot declining selection, Fudge was selected to compete in the marathon at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but she too turned the offer down. A month after the Olympics, she ran her best-ever marathon time, when finishing third at the Chicago Marathon in 2:29:47.In 2003, Fudge broke the UK W50 record by running 79:39 at the Fleet Half Marathon. A record that stood until 2011. She became an athletics coach at her running club Windsor, Slough, Eton and Hounslow Athletic Club\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fudge (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Paula Fudge (born 1952), English long-distance runner"]}, {"page": "Reading Half Marathon", "response": ["| Paula Fudge"]}, {"page": "1982 IAAF World Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Paula Fudge || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 14"]}, {"page": "1979 IAAF World Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Paula Fudge || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 17"]}, {"page": "List of 5000 metres national champions (women)", "response": ["*1983: Paula Fudge"]}, {"page": "Wokingham Half Marathon", "response": ["|7th||1991|| ||\tDavid Taylor\t||1.08.41\t||Paula Fudge\t||1.15.59"]}, {"page": "Sally Eastall", "response": ["Born in Stowmarket, Suffolk, Eastall finished 11th at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo.

A year later, she ran 2:34:47 for eighth at the 1987 London Marathon and was selected for the 1987 World Championships in Rome, where she finished 11th (and first Briton) in 2:38:12. The British trial race for the Seoul Olympics was the 1988 London Marathon on 17 April. With the top two British finishers assured of selection, she was the fourth British athlete, after Ann Ford, Susan Tooby and Sue Crehan, finishing eighth overall in 2:36:11. The third athlete selected to join Ford and Tooby in Seoul was Priscilla Welch, who decided to miss the London trial race and run the Boston Marathon the following day instead. In Boston, Welch ran faster than all the British women in London. In August 1988, both Ford and Welch withdrew from the Olympic team due to injury and an Olympic place was offered to Veronique Marot, who declined it due to injury. The place was then offered to Paula Fudge, who also turned it down. Finally, only a few weeks before the Olympic marathon on 23 September, Sue Crehan and Hulley (then Pain), were both selected to join Tooby in the British Olympic team. In Seoul, she ran her best ever marathon, running 2:30:51 for 10th place.
