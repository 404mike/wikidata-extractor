One explanation by Smith follows that the song is about the disturbing songs his father sung to him as a kid, and the horrible ending they would always have. Tim Pope, a long-time collaborator of the Cure on many of its music videos, interprets \"Lullaby\" as an allegory for lead singer Robert Smith's drug-addled past.", "The music video, directed by Tim Pope and edited by Peter Goddard, won British Video of the Year at the 1990 Brit Awards.", "Category:Music videos directed by Tim Pope"]}, {"page": "Friday I'm in Love", "response": ["The video, directed by Tim Pope, features the band performing the song in front of various backdrops on a soundstage, in homage to French silent filmmaker Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s: the video features the appearance of characters from his The Eclipse, or the Courtship of the Sun and Moon. Throughout the video the band play with various props and costumes while several extras wander around, causing chaos and ultimately trashing the set. Tim Pope makes a cameo at the beginning, riding a rocking horse and yelling out high-pitched stage directions through a plastic megaphone after inhaling helium from a balloon. The band's Japanese make-up artist also makes an appearance. The final shot is of bassist Simon Gallup crouching and peering into the camera while wearing a bridal veil and holding some champagne. The producer of \"Friday, I'm in Love\", Dave M. Allen, makes an appearance in the background, also holding up props.
