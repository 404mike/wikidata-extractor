In traditional logic there is more than one contrapositive inferred from each original statement. In regard to the \"A\" proposition this is circumvented in the symbolism of modern logic by the rule of transposition, or the law of contraposition. In its technical usage within the field of philosophic logic, the term \"contraposition\" may be limited by logicians (e.g. Irving Copi, Susan Stebbing) to traditional logic and categorical propositions. In this sense the use of the term \"contraposition\" is usually referred to by \"transposition\" when applied to hypothetical propositions or material implications."]}, {"page": "Bedford College, London", "response": ["*First woman to hold a chair in philosophy in the UK, Susan Stebbing."]}, {"page": "List of women philosophers", "response": ["*Susan Stebbing (1885\u20131943)"]}, {"page": "William Ernest Johnson", "response": ["Johnson's students included I.
