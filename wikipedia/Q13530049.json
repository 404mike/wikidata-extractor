By the late 17th century, the electorate of the three seats comprised the resident freemen of Monmouth, Newport and Usk, and after the Great Reform Act of 1832 the constituency was generally referred to as the Monmouth Boroughs.  The Representation of the People Act 1918 led to Newport becoming a parliamentary borough in its own right, and Monmouth was included in the new Monmouth county constituency.  The town has remained part of the Monmouth constituency in subsequent elections, although the constituency boundary has changed several times.  Notable Members of Parliament (MPs) for the area have included the industrialist Crawshay Bailey from 1852 to 1868; Peter Thorneycroft, Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1957\u201358 and Chairman of the Conservative Party 1975\u201381, who was the town's MP from 1945 to 1966; and John Stradling Thomas, MP from 1970 to 1991.  The constituency has returned a Conservative MP at most recent elections; the current member is David Davies, first elected in 2005.  In elections for the Welsh Assembly, the town is part of the Monmouth constituency; the current MS is Peter Fox (Conservative).
