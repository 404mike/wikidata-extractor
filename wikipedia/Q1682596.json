By the 1st century CE, most elite women avoided breast-feeding their infants themselves, and hired wet-nurses.Rawson, \"The Roman Family,\" p. 30. The practice was not uncommon as early as the 2nd century BCE, when the comic playwright Plautus mentions wet-nurses casually.Plautus, Miles Gloriosus 697. Since a mother's milk was considered best for the baby,As noted by Soranus (1st century AD) in his Gynaecology 2.18. aristocratic women might still choose to breast-feed, unless physical reasons prevented it.Jane F. Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society (Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 242. If a woman chose to forgo nursing her own child she could visit the Columna Lactaria  (\"Milk Column\"), where poor parents could obtain milk for their infants as charity from wet nurses, and those who could afford it could choose to hire a wet nurse.Lawrence Richardson, \"A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,\" (JHU Press, 1992), p. 94. Licinia, the wife of Cato the Elder (d. 149 BCE), is reported to have nursed not only her son, but sometimes the infants of her slaves, to encourage \"brotherly affection\" among them.Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder 20.3; Christopher Michael McDonough, \"Carna, Procra and the Strix on the Kalends of June,\" Transactions of the American Philological Association 127 (1997), p. 322, note 29. By the time of Tacitus (d. 117 CE), breastfeeding by elite matrons was idealized as a practice of the virtuous old days.Tacitus, Dialogus 28, as noted by McDonough, p. 322.", "Large families were not the norm among the elite even by the Late Republic; the family of Clodius Pulcher, who had at least three sisters and two brothers, was considered unusual.W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), p. 33ff. The birth rate among the aristocracy declined to such an extent that the first Roman emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BCE\u201314 CE) passed a series of laws intended to increase it, including special honors for women who bore at least three children (the ius trium liberorum).Janine Assa, The Great Roman Ladies (New York, 1960), p. 32; A History of Women in the West from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints, vol. 1, p. 115.
