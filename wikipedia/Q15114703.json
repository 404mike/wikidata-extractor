Cook's school also released six handbooks over an eight year period, known as the Perse Playbooks, containing various items produced by the school's pupils. (For details of Cook's approach, see Sydney Morning Herald, 5 January 1920 and, also, Cook (1917)). Following that sojourn in England, Lamb-Smith also studied in France, before returning to his instructional duties in Belgium, from whence he  was repatriated on 6 October 1919.", "One of the significant consequences of the time Lamb-Smith had spent at King's College London, and the reinvigoration and inspiration received from his studies of the \"play way\" approach of Henry Caldwell Cook, was his active encouragement of students' extra-curricular pursuits on his return to teaching at Caulfield Grammar."]}]}}
