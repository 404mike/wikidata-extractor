A former colliery worker, he was spotted on Hughie Green's Opportunity Knocks TV show by Les Reed, who signed him to a long-term deal with Chapter One Records. He had a high and distinctive falsetto voice, and managed to notch up chart hits for the Chapter One label, including \"Sally\", a song first made popular by Gracie Fields in the 1930s. Monroe's version was co-produced and co-arranged by Reed. In 1997 an album, Sally: Pride of Our Alley, was released on compact disc on the Gold Dust label. Monroe also recorded a tribute to Bobby Charlton in 1973, following the footballer's retirement, called \"Goodbye Bobby Boy\".\nMonroe died in October 1989 at the age of 56.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Opportunity Knocks (British TV series)", "response": ["Entertainers who appeared included Freddie Starr and the Delmonts, Su Pollard, Paul Daniels, Darren Day, Pete the Plate Spinning Dog, Los Caracas, later to become Middle of the Road,  Mary Hopkin, Bonnie Langford, Les Dawson, Maureen Myers, Barry Cummings, Royston Vasey (later to find fame as Roy 'Chubby' Brown), Little and Large, Bobby Crush,  Berni Flint, Tony Holland (The Muscle Man), Millican & Nesbitt, Neil Reid, Peters and Lee, Lena Zavaroni, Frank Carson, Max Boyce, Pam Ayres, Juniper Green, Gerry Monroe, Debra Stephenson, Tammy Jones, Paper Lace, Barry and Paul Elliott and Tony Monopoly.
