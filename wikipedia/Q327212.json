Besides being the drummer for the band, Heaton was also responsible for much of the band's songwriting, contributing particularly heavily towards the musical content of the album Thunder and Consolation. He was probably the first person to play a synchronous drum and harmonica solo, doing so in the song 'Shot 18' on the No Rest for The Wicked tour. \nAlthough Heaton was the fourth drummer in New Model Army he was the band's first touring and recording drummer, featuring on all albums from the band's first; 'Vengeance', released in 1984, until their seventh 'Strange Brotherhood', which was released in 1998, shortly before his departure due to health related reasons. Heaton also drummed for Hawkwind for a brief period in the 1980s, featuring on 'The Earth Ritual Preview' which was recorded in late 1983 and released in 1984.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hawkwind", "response": ["In the early 1980s, Brock had started using drum machines for his home demos and became increasingly frustrated at the inability of drummers to keep perfect time, leading to a succession of drummers coming and going. First, Griffin was ousted and the band tried King again, but, unhappy with his playing at that time, he was rejected. Andy Anderson briefly joined while he was also playing for The Cure, and Robert Heaton also filled the spot briefly prior to the rise of New Model Army. Lloyd Langton Group drummer John Clark did some recording sessions, and in late 1983 Rick Martinez joined the band to play drums on the Earth Ritual tour in February and March 1984, later replaced by Clive Deamer."]}, {"page": "Knutsford", "response": ["* Robert Heaton (1961 in Knutsford \u2013 2004) an English musician, drummer in the English rock band New Model Army"]}, {"page": "51st State (song)", "response": ["#\"No Rest\" (live) (Sullivan, Morrow, Robert Heaton)"]}, {"page": "New Model Army (band)", "response": ["New Model Army are an English rock band formed in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 1980 by lead singer, guitarist and main composer Justin Sullivan, bassist Stuart Morrow and drummer Phil Tompkins.  Sullivan has been the only continuous member of the band, which has seen numerous line-up changes in its four-decade history. Their music draws on influences across the musical spectrum, from punk and folk to soul, metal and classical. Sullivan's lyrics, which range from directly political through to spiritual and personal, have always been considered as a key part of the band's appeal.  By the time they began making their first records in 1983, Robert Heaton, a former drum technician for Hawkwind, had replaced Tompkins.", "===Death of Robert Heaton, and Carnival to Today is a Good Day (2001\u20132009)===", "After touring Eight, the band again took time out, most notably so that Sullivan could concentrate on his solo album Navigating by the Stars which was eventually released in 2003, and toured by Sullivan, Dean and White.
