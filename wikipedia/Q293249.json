The comparison originated from playwright Dennis Potter, who labeled Birt a \"croak-voiced Dalek\" in his MacTaggart Lecture delivered in August 1993 at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. The BBC's post-production department made a Christmas tape casting Birt as Davros, the head of the Daleks, which was alluded to many years later on a BBC DVD commentary for Genesis of the Daleks by former director  David Maloney.Voice-over commentary on the BBC DVD \"Genesis of the Daleks\" (1975, 2006) Journalist Mark Lawson wrote at the time that Potter's \"tendency towards unfocused vitriol and noisy self-examination made his contribution easily swattable by the BBC's damage controllers\".
