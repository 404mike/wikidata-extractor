A graduate of Oxford University, where he studied under Carolus Oldfield in the Department of Psychology in the 1950s, Stevens has two degrees in psychology in addition to a research doctorate (MD); during the 1950s Stevens also studied under Oldfield in the Department of Psychology at Reading. He is a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and a senior member of the Independent Group of Analytical Psychologists.\nEarly in his career Stevens did research under the supervision of John Bowlby into the development of attachment bonds between infants and their nurses at the Metera Babies Centre in Athens.  This led him to appreciate the role played by archetypal components in the formation of mother-child attachments and was to provide him with the basic insights which inspired his magnum opus, Archetype : A Natural History of The Self.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Evolutionary psychology", "response": ["Adaptationist hypotheses regarding the etiology of psychological disorders are often based on analogies between physiological and psychological dysfunctions, (adaptationist perspective to both physiological and psychological dysfunctions) as noted in the table below. Prominent theorists and evolutionary psychiatrists include Michael T. McGuire, Anthony Stevens, and Randolph M. Nesse. They, and others, suggest that mental disorders are due to the interactive effects of both nature and nurture, and often have multiple contributing causes."]}, {"page": "Carl Jung", "response": ["Within the field of analytical psychology, a brief survey of major concepts developed by Jung include (alphabetical):Anthony Stevens (1991) On Jung London: Penguin Books, pp. 27\u201353", "* Individuation \u2013 the process of fulfilment of each individual \"which negates neither the conscious or unconscious position but does justice to them both\".Anthony Stevens (1991) On Jung London: Penguin Books, p. 199.", "* Anthony Stevens \u2013 analytical psychologist, psychiatrist, and author", "* Anthony Stevens, Jung.

"]}, {"page": "Analytical psychology", "response": ["Whereas (Freudian) psychoanalysis relies entirely on the development of the transference in the analysand (the person under treatment) to the analyst, Jung initially used the transference and later concentrated more on a dialectical and didactic approach to the symbolic and archetypal material presented by the patient. Moreover his attitude towards patients departed from what he had observed in Freud's method. Anthony Stevens has explained it thus:", "The shadow is an unconscious complex defined as the repressed, suppressed or disowned qualities of the conscious self.Anthony Stevens, On Jung (London 1990) p. 43 According to Jung, the human being deals with the reality of the shadow in four ways: denial, projection, integration and/or transmutation. Jung himself asserted that \"the result of the Freudian method of elucidation is a minute elaboration of man's shadow-side unexampled in any previous age.\"Jung, C. G. 1993. The Practice of Psychotherapy. London. According to analytical psychology, a person's shadow may have both constructive and destructive aspects. In its more destructive aspects, the shadow can represent those things people do not accept about themselves. For instance, the shadow of someone who identifies as being kind may be harsh or unkind. Conversely, the shadow of a person who perceives himself to be brutal may be gentle. In its more constructive aspects, a person's shadow may represent hidden positive qualities. This has been referred to as the \"gold in the shadow\". Jung emphasized the importance of being aware of shadow material and incorporating it into conscious awareness to avoid projecting shadow qualities on others."]}, {"page": "Shadow (psychology)", "response": ["From one perspective, the shadow \"is roughly equivalent to the whole of the Freudian unconscious\";Anthony Stevens, On Jung (London 1990) p. 43 and Carl Jung himself asserted that \"the result of the Freudian method of elucidation is a minute elaboration of man's shadow side unexampled in any previous age\".Jung, C. G. 1993. The Practice of Psychotherapy. London. Contrary to a Freudian definition of shadow, however, the Jungian shadow can include everything outside the light of consciousness and may be positive or negative. Because one tends to reject or remain ignorant of the least desirable aspects of one's personality, the shadow is perceived to be largely negative. There are, however, positive aspects that may also remain hidden in one's shadow (especially in people with low self-esteem, anxieties, and false beliefs).Young-Eisendrath, P. and T. Dawson. 1997. The Cambridge Companion to Jung.
