Martin was not interested in sacrificing so much of the overall story. When the pilot for the HBO adaptation went into production years later, one of the first parts cast was Jon, with Kit Harington announced in the role in July 2009. Alfie Allen and Iwan Rheon had also auditioned for the role, and were brought into the show to play Theon Greyjoy and Ramsay Snow instead, respectively. In October 2014, Harington and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. The Hollywood Reporter called the raises \"huge\", noting that the deal would make the performers \"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\". Deadline Hollywood put the number for season five at \"close to $300,000 an episode\" for each actor, and The Hollywood Reporter wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \"upward of $500,000 per episode\" for seasons seven and the potential eight.

It is revealed that Maximus' Terrigenesis made him human causing him much envy towards Black Bolt, especially since their father, Agon, has denied Maximus his desire to rule. He stages a coup with the help of Auran and the Inhuman Royal Guards that are on his side while the rest of the Royal Family flee to Hawaii through Lockjaw. Though Lockjaw is stunned by Pulsus and Crystal is placed under house arrest. He attempts to have Crystal support him, but she rebels and flees to Hawaii as well, leaving Maximus to convince the council of the Royal Family's incompetence. He further sends out dangerous Inhumans, such as Mordis, to hunt the Royal Family. Maximus further has the human Dr. Evan Declan working for him so that he can study Black Bolt and hopefully use his DNA to create a new Terrigenesis for him. Maximus learns of Auran's position with Declan, but informs her to not tell him of her association with him. Maximus believes that in order for \"his\" people to gain freedom they have to earn it, therefore he sends Inhumans to hunt his family. Unbeknownst to him, some of the people of Attilan are plotting against him. He later finds out through genetic council member Tibor and has him and his conspirators killed as an example while asking the prophetic Inhuman Bronaja to pick a side. Maximus is reunited with his family for a parley. However, he cheats his family by taking Declan and forces him to prepare a second Terrigenesis. When he is alerted of his family's next move, he tries to escape, but is captured by Triton. He is brought to Black Bolt and tells him that he installed a failsafe so that if he kills him, Attilan will be destroyed. Maximus refuses to give up the throne or stop the dome over the city from collapsing and learns through Bronaja that he will remain the King of Attilan and that Black Bolt was nowhere in sight. Soon, Auran leaves him as the whole city and the Royal Family, sans Black Bolt, escape to Earth. Maximus reveals to Black Bolt that he indirectly killed his parents when he forged a signature for Black Bolt to get lobotomized. Maximus is knocked out and trapped in Attilan's bunker. As he looks at the well stocked room, Maximus realizes that he is still the king of Attilan and that Black Bolt has in fact left him as its only population as Bronaja predicted."]}, {"page": "Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series", "response": ["| Alfie Allen, John Bradley-West, Oona Chaplin, Gwendoline Christie, Emilia Clarke, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Mackenzie Crook, Charles Dance, Joe Dempsie, Peter Dinklage, Natalie Dormer, Nathalie Emmanuel, Michelle Fairley, Jack Gleeson, Iain Glen, Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Kristofer Hivju, Paul Kaye, Sibel Kekilli, Rose Leslie, Richard Madden, Rory McCann, Michael McElhatton, Ian McElhinney, Philip McGinley, Hannah Murray, Iwan Rheon, Sophie Turner, Carice van Houten, Maisie Williams", "| Alfie Allen, Ian Beattie, John Bradley-West, Gwendoline Christie, Emilia Clarke, Michael Condron, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Ben Crompton, Liam Cunningham, Stephen Dillane, Peter Dinklage, Nathalie Emmanuel, Tara Fitzgerald, Jerome Flynn, Brian Fortune, Joel Fry, Aiden Gillen, Iain Glen, Kit Harington, Lena Headey, Michiel Huisman, Hannah Murray, Brenock O'Connor, Daniel Portman, Diana Rigg, Iwan Rheon, Owen Teale, Sophie Turner, Carice van Houten, Indira Varma, Maisie Williams, Tom Wlaschiha"]}, {"page": "1985 in Wales", "response": ["**Iwan Rheon, screen actor"]}, {"page": "Soccer Aid", "response": ["* Iwan Rheon", "|MF ||12|| Iwan Rheon || || "]}, {"page": "List of biographical films", "response": ["||Iwan Rheon", "||Iwan Rheon"]}, {"page": "List of Family Guy guest stars", "response": ["|Iwan Rheon"]}, {"page": "Curtis Brown (agency)", "response": ["*Iwan Rheon, Welsh actor, singer and musician best known for his role in Game of Thrones."]}, {"page": "Music of Cardiff", "response": ["*Iwan Rheon"]}, {"page": "Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf", "response": ["* Iwan Rheon, actor"]}, {"page": "Spring Awakening (musical)", "response": ["| Iwan Rheon", "| Iwan Rheon"]}, {"page": "Green Man Festival", "response": ["Mogwai, Caribou, Fontaines D.C, Tirzah, Thundercat, Teenage Fanclub, Django Django, This Is The Kit, Jose Gonzalez, Gruff Rhys, The Staves, Nadine Shah, Black Midi, Shame, Lump, Kokoroko, BC Camplight, Nubya Garcia, Self Esteem, Richard Dawson, Kelly Lee Owens, Ghost Poet, Greentea Peng, Georgia, Snapped Ankles, Goat Girl, Billie Marten, Erland Cooper, Catrin Finch & Seckou Keita, Gwenno, Vanishing Twin, Porridge Radio, Viagra Boys, Working Men's Club, Boy Azooga, Ross From Friends (live), The Orielles, Matt Maltese, Emma-Jean Thackray, Pictish Trail, The Surfing Magazines, Peggy Sue, Yazmin Lacey, Overmono, Los Bitchos, Big Joanie, Jockstrap, Crack Cloud, Giant Swan, DJ Rap, Stephen Fretwell, Hen Ogledd, Alabaster Deplume, Falle Nioke, Liz Lawrence, Wu-Lu, Katy J Pearson, Steam Down, PVA, Sinead O\u2019Brien, Phoebe Green, NewDad, King Hannah, Hak Baker, H.Hawkline, Loraine James, Hannah Holland, Sarathy Korwar, Deep Throat Choir, Broadside Hacks, Fenne Lily, Ed Dowie, Buzzard Buzzard Buzzard, Peaness, Home Counties, Yard Act, The Lounge Society, Wet Leg, Matilda Mann, Gwenifer Raymond, Studio Electrophonique, Tony Njoku, LYR, John, The Golden Dregs, Deliluh, The Cool Greenhouse, Speedboat, Blood Wizard, Bugs, Caroline, Do Nothing, Drug Store Romeos, Duski, Egyptian Blue, Iwan Rheon, The Goa Express, Gonhill, Hanya, Laundromat, Lazarus Kane, Martha Skye Murphy, Melin Melyn, Modern Woman, Nuha Ruby Ra, Panic Shack, Pet Deaths, Prima Queen, Roscoe Roscoe, Sister Wives, Teddy Hunter, Tina, Alfresco Disco, Art School Girlfriend DJ, Big Jeff, Birthday Club, Charlotte Church's Late Night Pop Dungeon, Deptford Northern Soul Club, Dutty Disco, Hot Singles Clubthumb|right|300px| Fleet Foxes, headlining Green Man Festival 2018", "The Green Man Trust is the charitable wing of the festival, its aim is to create arts development programmes, training opportunities, science engagement and bring about positive change to Welsh communities.
