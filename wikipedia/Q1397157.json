Forced into maturity by the war, his poetic voice never lost a certain childlike note \u2013 indeed, in some of his best poems, naivety and wisdom coexist to an almost paradoxical degree. Such poetry was fired by a vision of a transcendental realm that lay beyond conflict, but never sought to exclude death. His 25 years, the last four of which were spent in the Army, scarcely left him time to develop a wholly independent voice, but his work displays an increasing mastery of form and deepening of vision.

This Du, more than a single woman, is extended to include womankind, humanity, and God. This the 'love' recorded ranges from debased sexuality in Freudenhaus (\"House of Pleasures\") to the love of God in Allmacht (\"Almighty\"). Love is seen as essentially ambiguous; or, rather, it cannot be separated from, and always involves it own opposite, strife. Appropriately, the collection begins with a poem that announces this duality: Liebeskampf (Love-Fight\").\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 125. Du. Liebesgedichte was published whilst Stramm was at the front in 1915.", "According to Jeremy Adler, \"Like no others in German, Stramm's war poems give an immediate impression of the front. By eschewing a self-conscious persona, and treating the poem itself as a reality, Stramm thrusts intense images of the war directly before the reader. Exploiting all his newly perfected techniques, he precisely conveys the exact moments, the various horrors of war: the terror of being under fire in Im Feuer, shelling in Granaten, hesitation in Zagen, the difficult advance in Signal, combat in Haidekampf, or single combat in Urtod (\"Primal Death\"). But there are also rare moments of beauty, as in the evening atmosphere of Abend, when the poet glimpses a higher being, the distant Du.\"Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 127.", "Even though, according to Jeremy Adler, \"Stramm's rigorous, demanding style,\" never gained him the popular appeal of Georg Trakl, Stramm, \"has had a significant influence on German poetry.\" First his verse was a model for the poets of the Sturm-Kreis (\"Sturm-Circle\") which included Kurt Heynicke, Otto Nebel, and Franz Behrens. Then, Dadaism and Kurt Schwitters took Stramm as their starting point. After the Second World War, Stramm's poetry inspired experimental writers like Gerhard R\u00fchm and Paul Celan.
