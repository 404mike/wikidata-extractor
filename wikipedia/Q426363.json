They were Gardner on guitars and lead vocals, Coling King on drums, and Danny Mitchell on keyboards (the latter two later of Modern Man and Messengers), and split up in 1977.In 1977, he joined a third band named Zones, composed of drummer Kenny Hyslop, keyboardist Billy McIsaac and bassist Russell Webb, who previously were part of PVC2, along with Midge Ure, who quit and moved to London to form The Rich Kids after the demise of the teenybop band Slik. They released singles including \"Stuck with You\", \"Sign of the Times\", \"Looking to the Future\" and \"Mourning Star\", and an album called Under Influence (1979), which was unsuccessful, before splitting up.\nAfter Zones, Gardner dedicated himself to a brief solo career, releasing two singles in 1982: \"Golden Youth\" and \"Imation\".

After Kevin McGinlay left in 1974, the band became Slik and began to release singles, among them, two hits: \"Forever and Ever\" and \"Requiem\", both released in eponymous singles, in 1975 and 1976, respectively. Slik fame was growing during 1976, but late that year, punk rock bands were hitting the musical scene, so in 1977, the band changed their name, to PVC2, after McGinlay was replaced by Russell Webb, and began to play as the latter bands did.  In September 1977, Midge Ure left PVC2, and the rest called Willie Gardner to replace him, and the band renamed themselves as Zones. Zones lasted until 1979, and the band finally split up. McIsaac and Hyslop continued with a project called Science, a band considered as a continuation of Zones, but only McIsaac was the supposedly remaining member.
