He was also a station-master.\nHis first candidacy for public office was at the 1922 general election, when he stood as a Labour Party candidate in the Leix\u2013Offaly constituency. He was returned to the 3rd D\u00e1il, and was re-elected at each successive general election until his death in 1956.He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government from 1954 to 1956.For most of this period, he was the only Labour deputy from Laois\u2013Offaly, but after the June 1927 general election he was joined in the short-lived 5th D\u00e1il by John Gill, who lost his seat at the September 1927 general election.\nSince Davin's death, Laois\u2013Offaly has returned a Labour TD only twice: at the 1965 general election, when Henry Byrne was elected to the 18th D\u00e1il, and at the 1992 general election, when Pat Gallagher was elected to the 27th D\u00e1il.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Government of the 15th D\u00e1il", "response": ["|William Davin", "Following the death of William Davin on 1 March 1956."]}, {"page": "Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures", "response": ["In 1943, Labour Party TDs William Davin and Timothy J.

She would ensure that the conditions on the ships were good, and that the horse were fit to travel. On one occasion she hired a vet to travel on a ship bound for France. She travelled across Ireland inspecting horses in her capacities in both the SPCA and ILPH. The work of Whitton and these groups came to public attention in 1952 when SPCA, ILPH, Our Dumb Friends' League and the Dublin Animals' Protection Association organised a protest march through central Dublin of 1000 people on 28 March 1952. They also held a well-attended meeting on 28 April 1952 at the Mansion House, Dublin. The common policy of the three groups was called the \"five Ps\", namely parades, posters, protest meetings, publicity and politics. Whitton did not live to see the ban on live horse exports from Ireland, but the campaigns resulted in legislation being passed to that effect in 1961, 1963 and 1964. Her work also secured the support of a number of TDs including Patrick O'Donnell, Alfred Patrick Byrne, William Norton, Patrick Cogan, Henry Morgan Dockrell, Michael Ffrench-O'Carroll, William Davin and taoiseach John A. Costello."]}, {"page": "Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage", "response": ["|William Davin"]}]}}
