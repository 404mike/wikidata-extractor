The Daily Mirror lauded Jones' \"superb comic timing\" in the role. At the 2005 and 2008 British Soap Awards, Maggie Jones won the award for \"Best Comedy Performance\" for her role as Blanche. She also won \"Funniest Performance\" at the 2009 Inside Soap awards.

To many (including myself), Blanche [...] was our favourite character. She gleefully defied the maxim that if you hadn\u2019t anything nice to say about somebody, you shouldn\u2019t bother saying it. Instead, she broadcast her malevolence from the rooftops and to her victims' astonished, deeply offended faces.\" Teeman called Jones a \"brilliant actress\" and noted: \"Blanche could be kind, but not often. She and Norris were the great gossip-mongering tag team of the Street, revelling in others' misfortune. Blanche often didn\u2019t have to say anything at all. She\u2019d just purse her lips. That was withering condemnation enough.\" Low Culture columnist Ruth Deller praised the work of the late Maggie Jones by stating: \"even from beyond the grave, she delivered one of Corrie\u2019s best storylines, with the reading of her will providing some classic Blanche moments.
