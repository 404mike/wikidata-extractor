He succeeded to the Barony on 30 July 1919 on the death of his father. He owned the Crichel House estate in Dorset.\nHe married Lady Mary Sibell Ashley-Cooper, daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, on 27 November 1928. They had one child: Hon. Mary Anna Sibell Elizabeth Sturt (b. 1929, d. 2010) who later fought the Government and won, leading to the resignation of a Minister, in the Crichel Down Affair.\nAlington may well be most notable for having dated Tallulah Bankhead in the 1920s. Alington was described as \"well cultivated, bisexual, with sensuous, meaty lips, a distant, antic charm, a history of mysterious disappearances, and a streak of cruelty.\" His bisexuality was well known. He was a friend of the Polish composer Karol Szymanowski who dedicated his highly sensuous Songs of an infatuated Muezzin Op.42 to the handsome young Englishman, on their publication in 1922.He had no male heir upon his death, so the title became extinct. The Crichel estate passed to his 11-year-old daughter Mary, who later married Commander George (known as \"Toby\") Marten.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury", "response": ["* Lady Mary Sibell Ashley-Cooper (3 October 1902\u00a0\u2013 2 August 1936) was married to Napier Sturt, 3rd Baron Alington of Crichel."]}, {"page": "List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: A", "response": ["| Napier Sturt, 3rd Baron Alington"]}, {"page": "Sturt (surname)", "response": ["* Napier Sturt, 3rd Baron Alington (1896\u20131940), son of the 2nd Baron Alington"]}, {"page": "Mary Anna Marten", "response": ["She was born Mary Anna Sibell Elizabeth Sturt on 12 September 1929 at Moor Critchel, the daughter of Napier Sturt, 3rd Baron Alington and  Lady Mary Sibell Ashley-Cooper, daughter of the 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, sometime Lord Steward to the Household of George V & Queen Mary, by his wife Lady Constance Sibell Grosvenor (d 1957), a great friend of Queen Mary, daughter of Earl Grosvenor, and sister of Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster.
