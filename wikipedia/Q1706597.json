Jukes based his Black Country on the seat of the great iron manufacture, which for him was geographically determined by the ironstone tract of the coalfield rather than the thick seam, running from Wolverhampton to Bloxwich, to West Bromwich, to Stourbridge and back to Wolverhampton again. A travelogue published in 1860 made the connection more explicit, calling the name \"eminently descriptive, for blackness everywhere prevails; the ground is black, the atmosphere is black, and the underground is honeycombed by mining galleries stretching in utter blackness for many a league\". An alternative theory for the meaning of the name is proposed as having been caused by the darkening of the local soil due to the outcropping coal and the seam near the surface."]}, {"page": "Ayr, Queensland", "response": ["In 1843, during the surveying voyage of HMS Fly, Lieutenant John Ince, Joseph Jukes and Frederick Evans sailed up the river near to where the town of Ayr is now located.

The genus is in the subfamily Murinae, and the family Muridae. The Bramble Cay melomys was first discovered in April 1845 by Charles Bampfield Yule, commander of the British ship HMS Bramble on Bramble Cay, a vegetated coral cay measuring  located at the northern tip of the Great Barrier Reef. At that time, the animal was so plentiful that his crew shot them with bows and arrows for fun. In May 1845, while visiting Bramble Cay via HMS Fly, naturalist John MacGillivray and Joseph Jukes collected a holotype, stored today in the British Museum of Natural History.

It was, however, in 1864 that the first systematic geological investigations began, when the Geological Survey of Newfoundland was inaugurated by Sir William Logan, who, on request of the colonial government appointed Alexander Murray as director.Charles Schuchert, Carl Owen Dunbar, Stratigraphy of western Newfoundland, Geological Society of America, Memoir 1, 1934, pg. 1. Murray and his assistant (and eventual successor), James Howley, were pioneering geologists whose work formed the basis for the first geological map of Newfoundland, published in 1907. After Howley's death in 1909, the Survey was temporarily disbanded. It was resurrected in 1926 under H.A. Baker, but it was not until the 1930s, under the leadership of Government Geologist A.K.

He performed investigations and analyses for Government projects such as the Geological Survey and helped to arrange extensive collections. He taught private students there and was on the council of the Royal Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland. He showed a very broad scientific foundation in his writing, with subjects as diverse as electromagnetism (as referenced by William Grove) and geology, his interest in the latter being particularly deep: he accompanied British geologist Joseph Jukes on field expeditions and wrote a chapter in Jukes's Student's Manual of Geology. His first-known scientific paper was for the Philosophical Magazine (July, 1845) describing his discovery of a more sensitive method for the detection of mineralised phosphoric acid. With Kane, he wrote on the usage of turf (for paper, charcoal and industrial gases) and beetroot and performed research on varieties of \"Swedish turnips\" (\"swedes\" to the Irish, of a variety now known as sugar beet) as a potential sugar-crop. He built a model sugar-production plant in the basement of the Museum. In 1846, he became the Museum's official chemist; this position was terminated after two years after his criticism of the Society's poor choice of crops for his experiment, but his work continued and was part of the National Exhibition of 1852.  He penned articles for The Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science (founded by Kane). He founded and edited The Journal of Progress in 1851, containing articles on the application of science for the development of Irish industry, including contributions from Kane. He authored a report on the National Exhibition in John Maguire's The Industrial Movement in Ireland (1853).  In 1854, he was appointed Professor of Chemistry of two different departments, one role specifically for popular lectures. He lectured at the Glasnevin Model Farm, Dublin, (see Albert College (Dublin)) and (later) helped to create the Munster Dairy Farm."]}, {"page": "Jukes, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Jukes"]}]}}
