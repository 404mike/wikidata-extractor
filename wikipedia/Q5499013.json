His family were Quakers, and he was educated at a Quaker private school and then in Lausanne and Paris. After a short experience of journalism in Bristol he came to London in 1868, and began to write for The Spectator. His early works included two novels, but the best examples of his prose are perhaps to be found in his volumes of short stories, Pastorals of France (1877), Renunciations (1893), Orgeas and Miradou (1896), reprinted in 1905 as A Dream of Provence.In 1900 he published another novel, The Collapse of the Penitent. As early as 1878 he had begun a long connection with the London Standard as art critic. He began his studies on etching with a noteworthy paper in The Nineteenth Century (1877\u20131878) on the etchings of Charles Meryon. This was followed by The Four Masters of Etching (1883), with original etchings by Sir FS Haden, Jules Jacquemart, JM Whistler, and Alphonse Legros; Etching in England (1895); an English edition (1894) of E Michel's Rembrandt: His Life, His Works, and His Time In Two Volumes; and a study and a catalogue of Whistler's Etchings (1886, 2nd edition 1899). His other works include Studies in English Art (2 vols., 1876\u201380), The Masters of Genre Painting (1880), On Books and Arts (1899), English Water Colour (1902), Turner and Ruskin (2 vols., 1900).He was knighted in 1912. He published that year his Memories, a book of reminiscences, social and literary. He also published Painters and Painting (1913) and a novel, Brenda Walks On (1916). He died at Sevenoaks.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Meryon", "response": ["Besides the twenty-two etchings \"sur Paris\", Meryon did seventy-two etchings of one sort and another ninety-four in all being catalogued in Frederick Wedmore's M\u00e9ryon and M\u00e9ryon's Paris; but these include the works of his apprenticeship and of his decline, adroit copies in which his best success was in the sinking of his own individuality, and more or less dull portraits. Yet among the seventy-two prints outside his professed series there are at least a dozen famous ones. Three or four beautiful etchings of Paris do not belong to the series at all. Two or three others are devoted to the illustration of Bourges, a city in which the old wooden houses were as attractive to him for their own sakes as were the stonebuilt monuments of Paris. Generally it was when Paris engaged him that he succeeded the most.

While distant from the Pre-Raphaelites in subject and technique, his paintings often reflect the juxtaposition of detail and colour that characterise much of Millais' and Leighton's work.

Walter Sickert: the Complete Writings on Art. Page 84. Oxford University Press, 2000. Scholar Meaghan Clarke ties \"real-life women art journalists\" such as Pennell to the literary figures and hacks that populate George Gissing's  New Grub Street, as well as to the concept of the New Woman. \"Like journalism and, one might argue, because of journalism, the London art world was undergoing an intensive popularization during the 1880s and 1890s.\" Keeping up (as Clarke puts it) \"a peripatetic pace in search of copy\", Pennell went to Paris in May for the art salons, and regularly visited the London galleries (from Cork Street and Bond Street in the fashionable West End to philanthropic art projects in the slums of the East End) to review the exhibitions.  She wrote critically of Walter Besant\u2019s People\u2019s Palace at Mile End (similar in spirit to Samuel and Henrietta Barnett\u2019s St Jude\u2019s at Whitechapel).
