He was created Earl of Limerick in the Peerage of Ireland on 1 January 1803, in recognition of his vocal and persistent support for the Union. In addition, he was created Baron Foxford of Stackpole Court in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 11 August 1815, giving him and his descendants a permanent seat in the House of Lords. During this part of his life he lived at South Hill Park, Berkshire, where he died in 1844.\nHis eldest son and heir, Henry, Viscount Glentworth, had predeceased him in 1834, and thus Limerick was succeeded in his titles by his Henry's eldest son, William.
