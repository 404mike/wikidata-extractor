He was ordained on 25 June 1882 for the Diocese of Galway. He was a member of staff at Maynooth, from the date of his ordination; and served as Vice-President from 1894. He was named Bishop of Clonfert on 16 June 1903, replacing Dr. Healy. He became Bishop of Galway on 29 April 1909.\nHis plans to build a new cathedral for the town were interrupted by World War I. He was a fluent Irish speaker and a supporter of the GAA. He was firstly buried in St. Patrick's Pro-Cathedral of Galway, but later re-interred in the crypt of the new Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas, Galway.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bishop of Clonfert", "response": ["| Thomas O'Dea"]}, {"page": "O'Dea", "response": ["* Thomas O'Dea (1858\u20131923), Bishop of Clonfert, Galway, and Kilmacduagh."]}, {"page": "Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas, Galway", "response": ["*Thomas O'Dea"]}, {"page": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Clonfert", "response": ["* Thomas O'Dea (1903\u20131909)"]}, {"page": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora", "response": ["|Thomas O'Dea"]}, {"page": "Thomas O'Doherty", "response": ["In July 1923 he was moved to Galway succeeding the man he had succeeded as Bishop in Clonfert, Thomas O'Dea.

In the 1950s, scholars like Fawn Brodie, Juanita Brooks, Thomas O'Dea, and Leonard Arrington began applying academic methods to their religious history, giving rise to the New Mormon History.  In this spirit, Robert Flanders, a professor at the RLDS-affiliated Graceland College, published Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi in 1965.  The book presented controversies, like Joseph Smith's polygamy, that were in contrast to faith-promoting teachings of the RLDS Church, and brought a backlash from some RLDS members.  Then Richard P. Howard, another proponent of the New Mormon History, was appointed Church Historian in 1966, further upsetting some traditional believers.  Howard opened the church archives and was optimistic about historical challenges."]}, {"page": "O'Dea, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas O'Dea"]}]}}
