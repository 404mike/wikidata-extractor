A mid-season slump saw the club needing an improbable sequence of results to make the play-offs but six wins and a draw from the last seven saw the club achieve exactly that and make Super 8s \u2013 the Qualifiers.", "Following a strong 2018 campaign in the Championship, Danny Ward carried off the Championship Head Coach of the Year Award at the end of season awards dinner held at the Principal Hotel in Manchester. The Broncos finished second in the regular season and commenced their Super 8s \u2013 Qualifiers campaign with a one-point win over the Widnes Vikings in which Jarrod Sammut kicked a vital 79th minute drop goal to secure the victory. This good start was followed up with key victories over Salford, Toulouse and Halifax to leave the Broncos with 8 points in the Qualifiers table sitting in fifth behind the Toronto Wolfpack in fourth, which meant London would face the Wolfpack away at the Lamport Stadium in Toronto on 7 October 2018 to decide the final Super League place in the so-called 'Million Pound Game'. London won a very tense and defensive game 4\u20132, thus earning promotion to Super League for the 2019 season. However, in spite of handing table leaders St Helens two of their three losses in the 2019 season, and several other notable wins against stronger opponents, Broncos were relegated after only one season back in the top flight, after losing their final game of the season to Wakefield.", "*  Danny Ward: 2018\u20132021"]}, {"page": "2005 Challenge Cup", "response": ["Katherine Jenkins performed at the match which was on 27 August at Millennium Stadium, Cardiff and attended by 74,213 spectators.

Hull fought back with a try from Motu Tony converted by Danny Brough. Hull took the lead for the first time through Gareth Raynor's try in the corner after a superb pass by Nathan Blacklock. Brough converted brilliantly to make the score 12\u20136. Leeds fought back and a try from Danny Ward was converted by Sinfield to draw the scores level. A dreadful Marcus Bai error in his own in-goal area as he tried to keep the ball alive gifted Richard Whiting a try for Hull which was converted by Brough.
