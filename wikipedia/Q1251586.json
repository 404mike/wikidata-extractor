He was sentenced in France to 10 years in jail in absentia; some of the stolen works were returned when he died, but many remained missing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Augustin-Louis Cauchy", "response": ["His royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. Niels Henrik Abel called him a \"bigoted Catholic\" and added he was \"mad and there is nothing that can be done about him\", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph Liouville rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute with political overtones concerned Jean-Marie Constant Duhamel and a claim on inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by Jean-Victor Poncelet, to be wrong."]}, {"page": "January 2", "response": ["*1803 \u2013 Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja, Italian mathematician and academic (d. 1869)"]}, {"page": "Ashburnham Pentateuch", "response": ["The miniatures were used as the source of a later cycle of wall-paintings at the church of St Julian in Tours.
