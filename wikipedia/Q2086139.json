At this wavelength, the antennas were only a few centimeters long, making radar much easier to fit to an aircraft. The mapping idea resurfaced in March 1941 when Philip Dee's group was developing a new AI radar, christened \"AIS\" in reference to its \"sentimetric\" wavelength. During tests in a Blenheim, the team noticed the same sort of effects Bowen had earlier. However, the set's wavelength, over ten times shorter than the original 1.5\u00a0m AI sets, provided much greater resolution and allowed them to pick out individual objects on the ground."]}, {"page": "Telecommunications Research Establishment", "response": ["The Automatic Gun-Laying Turret (AGLT) was an airborne radar used in bombers by the gunners against attack by fighter planes.

(The name \"Natural Philosophy\" was later retired, and Gunn became a Professor of Physics and Astronomy.) Dee wished to turn Glasgow University into a leading centre of expertise in nuclear and particle physics. This development provided Gunn with an opportunity to explore his newfound interest in those subjects. He was appointed to the Cargill Chair in Applied Physics in 1949. The Chair had been founded in 1920 and endowed by Sir John Traill Cargill of the Burmah Oil Co. Gunn would hold the Chair until 1982.", "During his time at Glasgow University, Gunn collaborated with Edwin Power, who had been his student at University College, and Bruno Touschek, a physicist from Germany, to produce mesons in proton collisions. This work helped marked the establishment of the field of particle physics. With Professor Philip Dee, Gunn received funding for nuclear physics research, which allowed him and his colleagues to build a linear electron accelerator. After Touschek moved to Rome, Italy, in 1953, Gunn collaborated with John Irving on the photodisintegration of light nuclei, which later became known as \"Gunn-Irving wave functions\"."]}, {"page": "Ernest Titterton", "response": ["After a call from Oliphant, who wanted to develop a 10\u00a0cm wavelength radiation generator, Titterton worked as a research officer with the British Admiralty for the early part of the Second World War, working on radar systems at the University of Birmingham. He was awarded a PhD in physics in 1941. Though the work was classed top secret, he was allowed to submit it. His examiners were the nuclear physicists John Cockcroft and Philip Dee, both of whom were engaged in work on radar at that time. He also carried out some research with Otto Frisch. The two noted spontaneous fission in uranium, but were unable to publish due to wartime security restrictions. Credit for the discovery therefore went to  Georgy Flyorov and Konstantin Petrzhak, who discovered it independently in 1940. While at the University of Birmingham, Titterton  met Peggy Eileen Johnson, a laboratory assistant, who helped him build a prototype spark gap generator.

He did provide Lovell with a much more powerful water-cooled klystron to use as a test source for the antenna work, which took place in ramshackle conditions.
