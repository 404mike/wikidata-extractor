He moved to London in 1906 where he studied art. His early works, including a fine Hamlet, were Beardsleyesque in style, but after 1925 he was influenced by the Art Deco movement. Books which he illustrated in this manner include Daphnis and Chloe and As You Like it. His work for Radio Times includes the cover of the Easter 1934 edition.Austen used several techniques in his illustrations, including wood-engraving and scraperboard, and changed styles to suit the text he was illustrating. He was also involved in advertising, producing adverts, several posters & numerous dustwrapper designs. He was a friend of Alan Odle and Harry Clarke and exhibited with them at the St George's Gallery in 1925. The novelist Dorothy Richardson wife of Alan Odle wrote about him in John Austen and the Inseparables (London: William Jackson, 1930).\nIssue 27 of The Imaginative Book Illustration Society's Studies in Illustration contains a biography & full bibliography by Martin Steenson.*", "link_mentions": {}}}
