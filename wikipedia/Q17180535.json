Nesta Douglas-Pennant who married Edward Warner in 1920", "The area in question was previously known as \"The Sale\", which appeared in maps from around 1641; in 1650 all the timber from the 150 acres of woodland in The Sale was sold off by the Lord of the Manor, Sir William Rowe. A new manor house was built in 1768 by Anthony Bacon at its easterly end, and named \u2018Highams\u2019. In 1793-4 then owner John Harman commissioned Humphry Repton to design extensive pleasure gardens and a man-made lake. In 1849, Highams became the property of Edward Warner. Open land was becoming a premium in the area, and parcels of the estate began to be sold off for development. In 1891, thirty acres of land, including the lake were purchased for \u00a36,000 and added to Epping Forest. Edward Warner's second son, Courtenay Warner, formed the Warner Estate Ltd. in the same year, to manage the manor house. In 1897 a company jointly owned by Warner Estate Ltd. and the Law Land Ltd. was formed, and in 1898 the Law Land Building Department undertook all building development.", "In 1934, Sir Edward Warner agreed to sell the undeveloped parts of the estate between Montalt Road and Henry's Avenue to Walthamstow Council, with the intention that it was to be used as a public open space."]}]}}
