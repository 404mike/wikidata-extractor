She makes video installations, documentaries, music videos and experimental films.\nSaro-Wiwa is the founding filmmaker of the alt-Nollywood movement. A movement that uses the narrative, stylistic and visual conventions of the Nollywood film industry but for subversive, politically challenging ends.\nFormerly a BBC journalist, her artistic practice emerged from her interest in changing the way the world sees Africa using film, art, and food. Her practice includes New West African Kitchen, a project where Saro-Wiwa re-imagines West African cuisine. Each feast also features African video art presentations and a mini lecture.\nOn 22 March 2011, Saro-Wiwa was named as one of the top 25 leaders of the African Renaissance in The Times newspaper.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ken Saro-Wiwa", "response": ["Saro-Wiwa and his wife Maria had five children, who grew up with their mother in the United Kingdom while their father remained in Nigeria.
