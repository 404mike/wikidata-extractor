The song, a Hendrix original, was from a long lost master tape of Hendrix alone playing a 12-string acoustic right-hand guitar, strung for left hand and singing in a Delta blues manner. This December 1967 live studio performance was filmed for, and included in the film See My Music Talking, and later included in the 1973 documentary Jimi Hendrix and accompanying soundtrack LP. Hendrix often played an electric version in concert. The last song on Blues is a live version of \"Hear My Train A Comin'\", recorded on May 30, 1970, at the Berkeley Community Theatre, that had previously been released on the posthumous Rainbow Bridge album in 1971."]}, {"page": "Steven Cook", "response": ["Cook is an alumnus of the College of Distributive Trades before it became a part of the London College of Communication. He initially worked as a display artist for leading department stores before taking on the role of stylist for Carlton Photographic Studios in London where he realised his passion for photography. This was followed by a stint in a small advertising agency in Surrey as photographer and graphic designer, working on ads and concert programmes for musicians Gary Numan and The Boomtown Rats. During this time he was also moonlighting as a house photographer for a circuit of prestigious restaurants and clubs in Knightsbridge and the West End, being on hand to photograph their celebrity clientele. A chance meeting with British photographer Bruce Fleming gave Cook the opportunity to assist and learn from this respected artist, best known for his classic images of Jimi Hendrix in the 60s."]}, {"page": "A Session with The Dave Clark Five", "response": ["*Bruce Fleming - photography"]}, {"page": "Hear My Train A Comin'", "response": ["Around the same time, Peter Neal was making a short film documentary about the Experience, titled Experience (also known as See My Music Talking).  On December 19, 1967, he captured Hendrix playing an impromptu solo version of \"Hear My Train A Comin'\".  The filming took place during a publicity photo session at the London studio of photographer Bruce Fleming, who had photographed the British album cover for Are You Experienced.  For the shoot, a twelve-string Zemaitis acoustic guitar restrung for a left-handed player was conveniently on hand.  Hendrix, seated on a stool against a white backdrop, sang while playing the guitar.  After a false start, he settles into the song, which biographer Keith Shadwick describes as \"100 percent country blues\u00a0... s[ung] with great feeling, however artificial the circumstances of the session may have been\".  Hendrix's acoustic guitar playing shows familiarity with the styles of Lead Belly, Robert Johnson, and Skip James.  Music writer Michael Fairchild compares some of his guitar techniques to those found in 1928 recordings by Tommy Johnson, such as \"Big Fat Mama\" and \"Big Road Blues\".  The guitar was tuned down two whole steps (C\u2013F\u2013B\u2013E\u2013G\u2013C), perhaps influenced by Lead Belly's twelve-string style.  At the end of the 3:05 performance, Hendrix laughs it off with \"Did you think I could do that?\""]}, {"page": "Dave Wallis", "response": ["His third novel, and his most famous, was Only Lovers Left Alive, published in 1964.David Simonelli -Working Class Heroes: Rock Music and British Society in the 1960s ...  2012\u2013 p94  \"Even the Rolling Stones entertained film scripts and at one point were scheduled to play parts in an adaptation of the Dave Wallis novel, Only Lovers Left Alive (1964).33 None of these efforts was particularly successful critically\u2014it would not ...\"Billboard \u2013 1966 5 21 p40 \"LOS. ANGELES. \"Only Lovers Left Along,\" a novel by English author Dave Wallis, will be used as the screenplay for the movie debut of the Rolling Stones. The group will receive a reported $1 million from British Decca for their movie venture.\" It is an eerily dystopian novel which asks the reader to imagine Britain taken over by teenagers. All the adults have done away with themselves by taking 'Easiway' suicide pills. The world immediately begins to crumble and shortage of all kinds leads to warfare. This updated echo of Lord of the Flies by William Golding is presented by Wallis in contemporary slang and a notably vivid, if dark, style. The new fiction reviewer in The Times said that the \"anti-social helmeted figures on the motorcycles, riding on their quests to plunder and attacking one another's strongholds, one of which is Windsor Castle, have a quality oddly like Malory's, and Mr. Wallis obviously enjoys drawing the parallel between his youngsters thrown on their own resources, learning how to live in the ruins of the sophisticated adult world, and the story of mankind settling down in the west after the barbarian invasions of the dark ages.\" The British first edition of the novel, published by Anthony Blond, has an era-defining, evocative staged wraparound jacket photograph by Bruce Fleming. In 1966 it was announced that The Rolling Stones would make their film debuts in a motion picture of the novel to be directed by Nicholas Ray and produced by Allen Klein and Andrew Loog Oldham.
