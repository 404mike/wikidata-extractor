Eight days later, a large convict rebellion led by John Knatchbull occurred. Around 150 prisoners initially overwhelmed guards stationed at the convict hospital and elsewhere, but Fyans quickly organised his soldiers to counter the outbreak, allowing them to fire freely upon the rebels. This resulted in around fifteen convicts being killed and many others wounded. Two soldiers also accidentally shot each other dead while trying to round up the mutineers. The surviving convicts were captured and under Fyans' authority they were treated sadistically. Many were severely beaten to such an extent that Fyans broke his sword hitting them with the flat surface of it. Fyans ordered special sturdier cat o'nine tails to be used to flog the prisoners and heavier leg-irons with roughened surfaces were manacled to them. Fyans kept the rebels locked-up, naked in overcrowded jails for many months in irons, inflicting mass floggings with thousands of lashes being meted out. These actions earned him the nickname of \u2018Flogger\u2019 Fyans. The penal settlement was described as \"hell upon earth\" by one convict."]}, {"page": "List of people legally executed in Australia", "response": ["* John Knatchbull \u2013 13 February 1844 \u2013 Former Royal Navy captain, publicly hanged in front of Darlinghurst Gaol for the murder of shopkeeper Ellen Jamieson with a tomahawk in Margaret Street."]}, {"page": "Sir Edward Knatchbull, 8th Baronet", "response": ["Knatchbull died aged 61, after a short illness, at his son's house at Provender, Kent and was buried in Mersham.
