In the fourth round, Cardiff were drawn against Third Division North side Darlington. The two sides had met in the competition two years earlier in which Cardiff required two replays to progress. In this meeting, Cardiff were able to win at the first attempt, with goals from Ferguson and McLachlan providing a 2\u20130 win. Cardiff met reigning holders Bolton in the fifth round, a team described as being \"almost invincible at home\" by The Times. Nearly 50,000 people attended the game at Burnden Park, as Cardiff were aggrieved early on after being denied a penalty. Bolton forward David Jack nearly opened the scoring as his shot hit the post before being cleared off the line. Keenor became the target of abuse from Bolton fans having injured Bolton's Jimmy Seddon in an international match a week before the match. Curtis later described how Keenor had led the team with an \"inspirational\" performance despite the barracking, commenting \"The worse it got, the better and harder he played.\" Early in the second half, Cardiff were awarded a penalty after McLachlan's cross was handled by a Bolton defender. Ferguson converted the penalty and he provided an assist for Len Davies to seal the game, crossing for his teammate to head the second and final goal."]}, {"page": "James Seddon (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Seddon"]}, {"page": "Ernie Phythian", "response": ["Born in Farnworth, Phythian was related to footballer Jimmy Seddon and referee Ken Seddon."]}, {"page": "1923 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|HB || || Jimmy Seddon"]}, {"page": "History of Bolton Wanderers F.C.", "response": ["On 28 April 1923, Bolton won the cup at their third attempt to win their first major trophy, beating West Ham United 2\u20130 in the first ever Wembley final.
