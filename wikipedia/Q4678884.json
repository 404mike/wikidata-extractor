The 2009\u201310 season started well until Mark Robins controversially departed to rivals Barnsley in September, leaving the Millers at the top of the league. Former manager Ronnie Moore replaced him and led the club to their first ever play-off final and first trip to the new Wembley Stadium, where they lost 3\u20132 loss. In March 2011, following poor form he left Rotherham by mutual consent, and Andy Scott replaced him until he was sacked in March 2012. Steve Evans succeeded him, in the first season at the New York Stadium, and won promotion by finishing second in League Two.

Carlisle then entered negotiations with Workington to allow Caig to combine his coaching duties with serving as an understudy to current first choice goalkeeper Adam Collin. During the 2014\u201315 season he was, alongside Paul Thirlwell, made caretaker manager for four games following the dismissal of Graham Kavanagh as manager. After an injury to first choice goalkeeper Mark Gillespie in September 2014, Caig was re-registered as a player to provide cover for backup goalkeeper Dan Hanford.

On his debut for the Londoners at Crewe Alexandra on 18 January, he came on as a substitute for Robbie Simpson at half-time and scored twice in Orient's 2\u20131 win, which took them to the top of League One. His six goals helped them to the play-offs, where on 13 May, again as a substitute, he scored in a semi-final win over Peterborough (2\u20131, 3\u20132 aggregate). 12 days later, in the final at Wembley Stadium, he came on in the 76th minute in place of Kevin Lisbie, and had his attempt saved by Adam Collin as the O's lost the penalty shootout."]}, {"page": "Scott Brown (footballer, born April 1985)", "response": ["Brown did not feature in the first half of the 2015\u201316 season due to the form of Liverpool loanee Danny Ward, and instead had to wait until Ward returned to Anfield in January before he could make the first of his 13 appearances that campaign. Despite being preferred to loanee Adam Collin in the second half of the season, he was released in May 2016. He was named as the club's Community Supporter of the Year after putting himself forward as AFC Community Trust Player Ambassador and giving up his free time to support dementia-related charity causes."]}, {"page": "Sanchez Watt", "response": ["On 30 May 2013, Arsenal announced that Watt was one of ten young professional players that would be leaving the club when their contracts expire on 30 June. Colchester United assistant manager Mark Kinsella confirmed that the former U's loanee was a target, with the club having already signed his former Arsenal teammate Craig Eastmond. On 28 June, Watt's transfer to Colchester was made permanent, signing a two-year contract with the Essex outfit. Following an injury sustained during a pre-season win against Maldon & Tiptree, Watt made his second debut for Colchester in a League Cup clash with Peterborough United on 6 August, coming on as a substitute for Alex Gilbey on 65 minutes as the U's succumbed to a heavy 5\u20131 home defeat. He then made his first league start of the season in a 1\u20130 win against Port Vale four days later. Watt was plagued by a troublesome ankle injury over the first few weeks of the season, and despite using an ice machine in an attempt to heal the issue, he became one of a number of players facing the treatment table as the first-team suffered an injury crisis. He was on the verge of a comeback in early October 2013 following a thigh injury that had kept him out of action, but was dealt a further blow with a quad injury that would rule him out for at least a further six weeks. He returned to training in early December, and finally returned to action on 26 December. He appeared as a substitute during Colchester's biggest win under Joe Dunne, a 4\u20130 win against Stevenage. Watt bagged an assist for himself in the process, setting up Craig Eastmond with a simple pass 13 minutes from time to round off the scoring. He scored his first goal of the season in an instrumental display against Gillingham on 11 January 2014, securing the opening goal in a 3\u20130 home victory. In the next match against Carlisle United, he netted a brace in the 4\u20132 win at Brunton Park on 18 January. Watt was sent off on his birthday for a second bookable offence when the U's visited Swindon Town in a 0\u20130 draw. The ensuing ban left Watt out of first-team action until 4 March, when he returned for Colchester's home fixture against high-flying Rotherham United. In the match, he hit the bar and had a goal disallowed after Clinton Morrison was judged to have fouled Millers goalkeeper Adam Collin. He ended the 2013\u201314 campaign with 23 appearances and three goals to his name."]}, {"page": "2010 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|GK ||1 || Adam Collin"]}, {"page": "Mark Gillespie (footballer)", "response": ["Gillespie made his first start for Carlisle in Carlisle's Football League Trophy tie against Preston North End on 4 September 2012.

The home side equalised two minutes before time, substitute Lucas Akins' shot was dropped by goalkeeper Adam Collin, and another substitute, Robin Shroot, was there to tap the ball in from close range. Three days later, on 21 August, Stevenage faced Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road, in the club's first away game of the campaign. The game ended 1\u20130 in Stevenage's favour, their first win of the league season, with Lucas Akins scoring his first goal for the club mid-way through the first half after the home side had failed to clear Luke Freeman's free-kick. The team then travelled to Oldham Athletic four days later, on 25 August, and secured a second straight 1\u20130 away win.
