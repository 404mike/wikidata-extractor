There had been a brief period after the departure of the previous manager, Cliff Britton when Everton was run by a committee. The reason for Buchan's appointment was a mystery. He was only given the title 'chief coach' so there must have been reservations already and he never gained the confidence of the board.  He had been a Scottish amateur international and was likeable but was out of his depth as a manager of a major team with an ambitious chairman (John Moores).  There were two poor seasons and Buchan was sacked after six straight defeats.  He was replaced by Johnny Carey. He returned to Scotland and was killed in a car crash in 1965 at the age of 45.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cliff Britton", "response": ["The board continued to refuse transfer funds and Britton had disagreements with them. While Britton was abroad with the team the board wanted to appoint an acting manager. The board had also interfered with other decisions, but Britton had also made several mistakes such as dropping and then selling the talismanic Dave Hickson. Eventually Britton resigned from Everton in 1956 saying that \"I want all managers to have the freedom to do the job for which they were appointed.\" A sub-committee of the board unsuccessfully ran the Everton team for the remainder of the season until Ian Buchan was appointed."]}, {"page": "John King (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["King started his career at Everton in 1957. He made 48 First Division appearances at Goodison Park under Ian Buchan and Johnny Carey over the course of the 1957\u201358, 1958\u201359, and 1959\u201360 campaigns. He then moved on to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, playing 21 Third Division games under Don Welsh, before he joined Tranmere Rovers and being signed by Walter Galbraith. Rovers were relegated out of the Third Division in 1960\u201361. New manager Dave Russell led them to a 15th-place finish in the Fourth Division in 1961\u201362. They then reached eighth in 1962\u201363 and seventh in 1963\u201364, before finishing fifth in 1964\u201365, just one place and one point behind promoted Oxford United. They came even closer in 1965\u201366, finishing behind promoted Colchester United on goal average. Rovers finally achieved their goal in 1966\u201367, winning promotion in fourth place, they finished four points ahead of fifth place Crewe Alexandra. They then retained their third tier status in 1967\u201368, finishing two places above the relegation zone. Over eight years at Prenton Park, King made 264 appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Jimmy O'Neill (footballer, born 1931)", "response": ["Dublin-born O'Neill played junior football in Republic of Ireland for Bulfin United, and was an Irish schoolboy international. He was spotted in a youth international match in Brentford by Everton and signed as a professional with the club in May 1949, the \"Toffees\" seeing him as a potential replacement for 39-year-old Ted Sagar. He made his d\u00e9but as an 18-year-old against Middlesbrough in August 1950. Everton were relegated out of the First Division in 1950\u201351. They finished seven points short of promotion in 1951\u201352, before dropping to 16th in 1952\u201353, just five points above relegation. O'Neill played in the 1953 FA Cup semi-final against Bolton Wanderers, and shared the goalkeeping duties with Harry Leyland during the promotion campaign of 1953\u201354, as Cliff Britton led the club to a second-place finish, behind champions Leicester City on goal average but ahead of Blackburn Rovers by a single point. Everton then finished 11th in the top-flight in 1954\u201355, and 15th in 1955\u201356. New boss Ian Buchan led the club to 15th in 1956\u201357 and 16th in 1957\u201358. O'Neill did not get along with new manager Johnny Carey and so became unsettled. He remained though for further mid-table campaigns in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, and played a total of 213 league and cup games during his time at Goodison Park."]}, {"page": "Bert Llewellyn", "response": ["Llewellyn signed his first senior contract with Everton in May 1956. He scored on his \"Toffees\" debut, a 2\u20130 win over Blackpool at Goodison Park on 22 August, and scored another goal three days later in a 2\u20132 draw at home to Bolton Wanderers. He went on to play nine further league games for Everton, without finding the net. Under the stewardship of Ian Buchan, the club finished 15th in the First Division in 1956\u201357, and then 16th in 1957\u201358."]}, {"page": "Graham Williams (footballer, born 1936)", "response": ["He made his Everton debut in a 2\u20131 defeat to Sunderland in March 1956. The \"Toffees\" struggled at the lower end of the table under the stewardship of Ian Buchan in 1956\u201357 and 1957\u201358, and showed little sign of improvement in the 1958\u201359 season under Johnny Carey. In his three years at Goodison Park, Williams scored six goals in 31 top-flight games."]}]}}
