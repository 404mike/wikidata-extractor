Newman managed just 5 wins during the remainder of the campaign as Derby finished a lowly 16th and where only saved from relegation by the return of the mercurial Charlie George on non-contract terms from Bournemouth. Other late signings, such as John Barton and John McAlle were also vital, and an ageing Kevin Hector was still contributing to the cause; he grabbed his 200th Derby goal in a 2\u20133 League Cup 2nd Round defeat by West Ham and made his final appearance for the club, his 589th (a club record), in a 3\u20132 victory over Watford on the final day of the season at the Baseball Ground and notched his 201st and final goal for the club with the opener, only Steve Bloomer having more goals for the club,. Despite successfully staving off relegation Newman always knew his position at Derby was under siege and, with yet another change of chairman, Snooker impresario Mike Watterson replacing Richard Moore, Newman was dismissed 13 games into the 1982\u201383 season, with just one win to his credit, to be replaced by Peter Taylor."]}, {"page": "McAlle", "response": ["#REDIRECT John McAlle"]}, {"page": "McAlle, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn McAlle"]}]}}
