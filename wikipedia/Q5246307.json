He has held coaching roles at the club, and recently briefly became interim manager of the club in August 2021.He is the club's longest-serving player, and as of 11 September 2021 he holds the most amount of career league appearances of any active EFL player at one club. On that date, Lewington achieved his 700th career League appearance against Portsmouth FC at Stadium MK, Joining fellow left sided defenders Roy Sproson (760), Jimmy Dickinson, (764), and John Trollope (770) as the only players in football league history to have achieved 700 league appearances for a single league club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Milton Keynes Dons F.C.", "response": ["|2021|| Dean Lewington"]}, {"page": "Gary MacKenzie", "response": ["In 2011\u201312 season, MacKenzie made twenty-appearance, but soon would be often used in first team ins and out. On 17 September 2011, he made assist Dean Lewington before being sent-off for stamping on Alan Lee, in a 1\u20131 draw against Huddersfield Town. After the match, Manager Karl Robinson criticise MacKenzie as \"disgrace\", believing he deserved to be punished. In the first match of 2012, MacKenzie scored his first 2012-goal, in a 1\u20130 win over Colchester United, but his goal against Colchester United was later recorded as an own goal by the Football League, eight days later. Several weeks later on 24 January 2012, he scored an own-goal, in a 4\u20132 loss against Stevenage; then scored another own-goal, in the next game, in a 1\u20131 draw against Sheffield Wednesday. On 14 February 2012, MacKenzie, once again, sent-off for giving away the penalty and then head-butted Yann Kermorgant. After the match, Robinson was disappointed with his action, though he was sarcastically proud of him \"in a weird way for coming out and accepting his punishment.\" MacKenzine, himself, apologised to teammates and my manager and the fans and regretted his action, something that it's wrong. After serving his four match ban, MacKenzie was since left out of the first team squad throughout March. He made his return on 7 April 2012, in a 1\u20131 draw against Preston North End."]}, {"page": "Pawel Abbott", "response": ["In July 2006, Abbott rejected a move to Milton Keynes Dons as part of a deal or no deal with their defender Dean Lewington. He said that he wanted to fight for a first-team place against Gary Taylor-Fletcher, Andy Booth, John McAliskey and new signing Luke Beckett. In his penultimate game for Huddersfield on 30 December 2006 he scored two goals (including a last minute winner) against the club he would ironically go on to join in a matter of days; Swansea City. In his final game for Huddersfield he was sent off against Doncaster Rovers on 1 January 2007."]}, {"page": "Stephen Gleeson", "response": ["Robinson's team, built round Gleeson, Potter and Chadwick, were second in the table by the end of November. On 2 December 2012, Gleeson produced another goal from distance to open the scoring in MK Dons' first meeting with AFC Wimbledon. MK Dons won 2\u20131 to progress to the third round of that season's FA Cup, and the goal was voted the club's goal of the season. A couple of weeks later, he suffered a break in his left foot during training, which coincided with Chadwick damaging knee ligaments. During their absence, MK Dons dropped down the league. Gleeson returned in a match against Doncaster Rovers on 5 March 2013, which he celebrated with a goal to seal a 3\u20130 victory. Captaining the side in Dean Lewington's absence through injury in April, Gleeson scored a late winner against Brentford to lead the team to a second consecutive victory as they went on to finish four points outside the play-off places. Robinson speculated whether the disruption to the team caused by Gleeson's and Chadwick's injuries might have cost them promotion."]}, {"page": "Joe Colbeck", "response": ["He immediately went back into the Bradford side, and added his second goal for the club in a 2\u20130 win over Accrington Stanley on New Year's Day. Darlington made a bid to sign Colbeck on a permanent basis during January 2008, but City chairman Julian Rhodes turned down the bid, and Colbeck was a regular player for the rest of the 2007\u201308 season. The run of games included the third goal in a 3\u20131 win against former side Darlington at the Darlington Arena. On 19 April 2008, he scored his sixth goal for the club, but first in a home game, when his last minute goal gave Bradford a 2\u20131 win over Grimsby Town. Three days later, Colbeck was announced as the club's player of the season, even though he had started just 26\u00a0league games, 23 of which came in City's 26\u00a0games since Colbeck returned on loan from Darlington. Colbeck was surprised to win the award, saying: \"If you'd said at the beginning of the season that I would win this award, I'd have thought you were mad. I wasn't even a regular in the team.\" However, in the following league game, Colbeck was sent off for the second time in his career, for a foul on Dean Lewington, as City lost 2\u20131 to Milton Keynes Dons, which meant he missed the final game of the season through suspension."]}, {"page": "EFL Awards", "response": ["|Dean Lewington (Milton Keynes Dons)"]}]}}
