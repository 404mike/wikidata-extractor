This manifested itself on the pitch as the club struggled to direct itself clear of the relegation zone. However a highlight was Given saving a Kevin Nolan penalty in a 1\u20130 win over Bolton Wanderers. On 2 January 2009, following the 5\u20131 defeat at home against Liverpool, the player's lawyer released a statement saying that his client was \"considering his future\" at Newcastle, and requested permission to talk to representatives of Manchester City on 28 January after the club made a bid of \u00a35\u00a0million which was subsequently rejected. Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear had already stated that the club was \"not interested at all in selling him\", and described the amount on offer for Given as \"insulting\". However, on 30 January, it was reported that Newcastle had given permission for Given to enter talks with his suitors. After a transfer fee initially reported to be around \u00a38\u00a0million was agreed between the clubs, Given signed for Manchester City on 1 February, with the transfer window set to close the following day. Although the fee for Given was expected to be around \u00a38\u00a0million, in February 2009 Newcastle United managing director Derek Llambias revealed at a supporters panel meeting that Given had been sold for an initial \u00a35.9\u00a0million.

With players like Colin Veitch, Jackie Rutherford, Jimmy Lawrence and Albert Shepherd, Newcastle had a team of international talent. Bill McCracken, Jimmy Howie, Peter McWilliam and Andy Aitken were also household names in their day.
