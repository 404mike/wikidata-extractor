The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner. Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture. Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus,Paul Wood, The Challenge of the Avant-Garde, Yale University Press, 1999, Page 244,  but it was less publicised and consequently, is less familiar to the West.Tony Fry, Inc NetLibrary, A New Design Philosophy an Introduction to Defuturing, UNSW Press, 1999, Page 161,  Vkhutemas's influence was expansive however\u2014the school exhibited two structures by faculty and award-winning student workPenelope Curtis, Sculpture 1900\u20131945: After Rodin, Oxford University Press, 1999, Page 188,  at the 1925 Exposition in Paris. Furthermore, Vkhutemas attracted the interest and several visits from the director of the Museum of Modern Art, Alfred Barr. With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus.Timothy J. Colton, Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis, Harvard University Press, 1995, Page 215,  The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, El Lissitzky's book Russia \u2013 an Architecture for World Revolution published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects. Both schools flourished in a relatively liberal period, and were closed under pressure from increasingly totalitarian regimes."]}, {"page": "Hermann Blumenthal", "response": ["* Penelope Curtis (ed.): Taking Positions.

As with other depictions of Lenin from this period he is depicted bareheaded (his hat is shown tucked into the right-hand pocket of the overcoat).  Lenin is depicted with his right arm raised to shoulder height, palm forwards and thumb upraised.  This \"taxi-hailing\" pose is common to many Lenin statues, though Berkeley Professor Laura Bonnell states that this depiction differs from later versions in that Lenin's arm is used to indicate a directional movement, rather than offering a benediction to the masses.  The statue's left hand holds the lapels of Lenin's overcoat and suit jacket.  The monument is described by Oxford Professor Penelope Curtis as the \"first important monument\" of Lenin and establishing a style that has been much repeated by later statues.  Joseph Brodsky thought the statue the first ever to depict a person on top of an armoured car and compared it to the tradition of equestrian statues of previous leaders."]}, {"page": "Terry Friedman", "response": ["In 1993 the Henry Moore Centre for the Study of Sculpture was renamed the Henry Moore Institute, moved into new premises, and Penelope Curtis succeeded Terry Friedman as its head."]}, {"page": "Adam S.
