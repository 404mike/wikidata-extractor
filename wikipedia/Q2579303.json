He was known as \"Hodson of Hodson's Horse\".His most celebrated action was to apprehend Bahadur Shah II, the Mughal king of Delhi (also referred to as emperor of India). The following day Hodson rode to the enemy camp, heavily outnumbered by the rebels, and demanded the surrender of the Mughal princes who were leading the rebellion around Delhi and subsequently shot his prisoners.Hodson's career received praise from a number of senior military commanders, such as General Hugh Gough, but there were dissenting voices from other members of the military. There were also politicians who felt the killing of Mughal princes by Hodson had been \"dishonourable\". However, Hodson's career received praise from more senior politicians including the prime minister and the secretary of state for India.Hodson is credited with being jointly responsible for the introduction of the first khaki uniforms in the Indian army.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "South Luffenham", "response": ["*James Stephen Hodson, who was rector 1877-81, is commemorated here along with his brother William Stephen Raikes Hodson (1821\u20131858), a soldier prominent in the Indian Mutiny - \"Hodson of Hodson's Horse\"."]}, {"page": "Major William Hodson", "response": ["#redirect William Stephen Raikes Hodson"]}, {"page": "La Martini\u00e8re College, Lucknow", "response": ["==Brevet Major William Stephen Raikes Hodson==", "Brevet Major William Stephen Raikes Hodson (1821 \u2013 1858) was a British leader of irregular light cavalry who raised the Cavalry regiment known as Hodson's Horse.

Lawrence chose as its commandant Sir Harry Lumsden, supported by William Stephen Raikes Hodson as Second-in-Command, who began the process of raising the Corps of Guides from British Indian recruits at Peshawar for frontier service. Initially the border troops were dressed in their native costume, which consisted of a smock and white pyjama trousers, made of a coarse home-spun cotton and a cotton turban, supplemented by a leather or padded cotton jacket for cold weather. For the first year (1847) no attempt was made at uniformity; in 1848 Lumsden and Hodson decided to introduce a drab (khaki) uniform which Hodson commissioned his brother in England to send them \u2013 as recorded in Hodson's book of published letters, Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India (first published in 1859).
