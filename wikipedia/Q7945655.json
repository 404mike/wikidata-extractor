Some members are at the forefront of Scottish mountaineering developments and this has been the case throughout the Club\u2019s history. For instance, W. H. Murray was one of the preeminent mountaineers of the 1930s and his book, Mountaineering in Scotland, published in 1947, is a classic of the genre. The SMC president at the time was Percy Unna who, as a keen conservationist, raised the funds to purchase Glen Coe and other highland areas, ultimately presenting them to the National Trust for Scotland in order, to safeguard them for future generations.
