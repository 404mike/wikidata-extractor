He first visited St Ives, Cornwall, in 1928 with his fellow painter Christopher Wood, where he met the fisherman and painter, Alfred Wallis. In Paris in 1933 he made his first wood relief, White Relief, which contained only right angles and circles. In 1937 he was one of the editors of Circle, an influential monograph on constructivism. He believed that abstract art should be enjoyed by the general public, as shown by the Nicholson Wall, a mural he created for the garden of Sutton Place in Guildford, Surrey.

The newer category of Outsider Art is only appropriate for his more visionary work. While Stockley, as his letters show, was unsympathetic to most contemporary art, he was certainly seen by collectors in the 1930s and 1940s as a modern artist, even if in a naive mode. Lister and Williams, in their book, British Naive and Primitive Art [1977] regard Stockley as one of the \"rare and much to be treasured\" primitives along with Wallis and James Dixon. They write of Stockley's \"primitive enthusiasm\" and \"simple naive style\" [Lister and Williams, 1977:170]. As with so many critics, they were simply unaware of the range and complexity of Stockey's output. Their illustration [Coneys, 1933, as yet untraced] is in dull monochrome:  Stockely's dazzling and unusual colours are shown in a dusty grey. As the Times critic noted in 1932, the bus-driver label attempted to associate his work with La Douanier Rousseau, another naive artist whose work was worthy to be shown alongside great masters. Stockely saw himself differently, as a great if unacknowledged artist, a \"new old master.\"  His letters only passingly mention other artists, but include scathing comments on Graham Sutherland coupled with his own wish to design work for cathedrals. Stockley was certainly familiar with the National Gallery collection; and some of his work resembles Italian Primitives. He also named one of his houses after Rembrandt, and the house still bears the name. He must also have been familiar with the artists his patron Lucy Wertheim showed: Alfred Wallis, Christopher Wood, Phelan Gibb and Frances Hodgkins for example, and the distinctly \"modern\" painters shown by Jack Bilbo in his gallery of Modern Art [a checklist of modern painters, Bilbo, 1946].", "* Gale, Matthew [1998].
