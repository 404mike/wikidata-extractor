In 1980 he moved to Huddersfield, West Yorkshire where for thirteen years he became part of a flourishing local poetry scene, largely centred around the critically constructive workshops of The Poetry Business and The Albert Poets in which many fine writers participated including Simon Armitage, David Morley, Peter Sansom, Janet Fisher, Milner Place, John Duffy, John Bosley and Stephanie Bowgett. It was his time in Huddersfield that saw the publication of his first three collections. In 1993 he moved to rural Aberdeenshire where he lived for eight years, this being the inspiration for his fourth collection Here In Scotland (with Czech artist and writer Milan Knizak)."]}]}}
