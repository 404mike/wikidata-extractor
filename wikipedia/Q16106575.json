The match was in the same week that his time on the Lord's ground staff was completed.Doust (1981), p. 42. Somerset batted first, and Botham, number seven in the batting order, scored two runs before he was dismissed leg before wicket (lbw) by Mike Buss. Somerset totalled 139 for 9. Sussex won comfortably by six wickets, reaching 141 for four with fifteen deliveries remaining. Botham bowled three overs without success, conceding 22 runs. He did impress, however, by taking a diving catch to dismiss his future England colleague Tony Greig off the bowling of his captain Brian Close.Murphy (1988), pp. 24\u201325."]}, {"page": "Tony Greig", "response": ["Greig was born to a Scottish immigrant father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College \u2014 during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. \"He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He would look at me sometimes and say 'Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war', but in the end he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'\".Wisden 1975"]}, {"page": "Indian cricket team in England in 1971", "response": ["Mike Buss and Geoff Greenidge scored 199 before the first wicket fell.

It was given to the town's cricket club in 1900 by a local brewer, William Allen. Construction of the ground required the land to be levelled by some , which some locals believed to be an error as the ground now lies below the water level of nearby the River Ryton. Construction was completed by 1901 and included a pavilion, with the new cricket ground replacing one which had been sited south of the River Ryton. The ground was due to be opened in 1901 with a match between Worksop and Nottinghamshire Club and Ground, but the match was abandoned due to rain. The ground was adjoined on its eastern side by the stadium of Worksop Town F.C.. Nottinghamshire first played at the ground in a first-class match against Derbyshire in the 1921 County Championship. Nottinghamshire played there twelve times prior to the Second World War. After a gap of twenty years, Nottinghamshire returned to the ground in 1959 and often played matches there in July to coincide with the annual holidays at the local coalfields. Worksop is located just a few miles from the South Yorkshire border, with Yorkshire being the visitors on thirteen occasions. Their affinity with the ground led to success for Yorkshire players such as Geoffrey Boycott who scored over 900 runs on the ground and averaged well over 100, and Fred Trueman who once took figures of 8 for 84 in 1962. Nottinghamshire played first-class cricket at the ground until 1998, having played 48 first-class matches there in the County Championship, Nottinghamshire also played three List A one-day matches at the Town Ground in the John Player League between 1970 and 1980, with Sussex's Mike Buss making the only List A century at the ground with a score of 121 in 1971."]}, {"page": "Richard Holmes (cricketer)", "response": ["While studying at the University of Cambridge, Holmes made a single appearance in List A cricket for the university cricket team in the 1974 Benson & Hedges Cup against Sussex at the County Cricket Ground, Hove.
