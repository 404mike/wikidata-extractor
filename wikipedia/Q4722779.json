In 1738, the manuscripts were ordered and sent out for binding. However, Richard Rawlinson consulted the collection from 1736-9, before any catalogue of Tanner's manuscripts had been made publicly available -- though Tanner's listing of some of the papers came with the collection. Tanner's contribution to the Bodleian's collection of 20,000 charters and rolls was also one of the most significant. In 1741 Thomas Toynbee (then an undergraduate at Balliol) was paid to catalogue the Tanner manuscripts (later followed by Alfred Hackman in 1860). In August 1744 the first order for one was recorded in the Library's entry-books. The printed books were not catalogued at the same rate, and the first order for a Tanner book came from Rawlinson in October 1750, and the first orders designated by shelf-mark date from 1755."]}, {"page": "Tiversk", "response": ["The site of Tiversk was first identified and described by Jacob Groot in 1847.
