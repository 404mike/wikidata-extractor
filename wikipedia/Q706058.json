Also featuring in this campaign was his younger brother Frank, who had likewise come through the ranks at Elland Road. This was the swansong of the great Don Revie team (Revie himself had left a year earlier to take over as England manager) and Gray's teammates started to leave the club. By the early 1980s, Gray was the only player from any part of the Revie era still at the club (although Peter Lorimer and David Harvey would later make comebacks).

Glanville contends that Bell's excellence was threatening Bobby Charlton's place in the England team.  England were seeking to replicate their performance in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, which they had won. Bell's City teammate Francis Lee was also included in the squad. In order to help the players acclimatise to the heat of Mexico, the team staged an intra-squad mini-olympics which saw Bell win every event.

The only goal that Tomaszewski conceded was an equalizing penalty from Allan Clarke. In drawing the game, Poland qualified for the finals in West Germany at the expense of England. England's failure led to manager Alf Ramsey's departure.
