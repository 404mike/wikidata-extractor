In 1864 he moved to study at Graig House Academy, Swansea, and from there, in 1866, to Bristol Baptist College.\nIn 1872 he was appointed to the post of Classical Tutor at Llangollen Baptist College, and thence devoted himself to the task of assisting the weaker churches, and strengthening the position of the Baptist denomination in North Wales. He was also instrumental in the relocation of the Baptist College from Llangollen to Bangor (effected in 1892).\nHis written works (as \u2018Gethin Dulais\u2019) include contributions of verse to Welsh periodicals, and a number of Welsh hymns.He died in London in 1896, aged 49, of cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of multi-instrumentalists", "response": ["*Gethin Davies"]}, {"page": "Grace Dulais Davies", "response": ["Grace Margaretta Dulais Davies was born in Llangollen in 1887 or 1888, the youngest child of Gethin Davies, principal of North Wales Baptist College, Bangor, and Rose Davies.
