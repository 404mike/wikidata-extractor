In a speech at Chatham House for the launch of the book on 6 September, he advised Thatcher to fight the next general election on a nationalist theme as many Eastern European nations previously under Russian rule were gaining their freedom. At the Conservative Party conference in October, he told a fringe meeting, \"I find myself today less on the fringe of that party than I have done for 20 years\". After Thatcher resisted further European integration at a meeting at Strasbourg in November Powell asked her parliamentary private secretary Mark Lennox-Boyd to pass to her \"my respectful congratulations on her stand\u00a0... she both spoke for Britain and gave a lead to Europe\u2014in the line of succession of Winston Churchill and William Pitt. Those who lead are always out in front, alone\". Thatcher replied, \"I am deeply touched by your words. They give me the greatest possible encouragement\"."]}, {"page": "Red telephone box", "response": ["In 1980, in preparation for privatisation, Post Office Telephones was rebranded as British Telecom (BT). In February 1981, it was announced that all the red telephone boxes would be repainted yellow, which was BT's new corporate colour. There was an immediate public outcry; the Daily Mail launched a campaign \"against the yellow peril\" and questions were asked in Parliament. In the House of Lords, the Earl of Gowrie, the Minister of State for Employment, called on BT \"to abandon this ridiculous scheme\". In the House of Commons, Mark Lennox-Boyd MP asked the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, if she would treat the decision \"with the greatest possible dismay\". Thatcher, who was responsible for the privatisation, would only say that she could \"see my honourable Friend's point\". Shortly afterwards, BT announced that only 90 of the 77,000 remaining traditional boxes had been painted different colours \"as an experiment\" and that no final decision had been reached."]}, {"page": "Worshipful Company of Fishmongers", "response": ["* The Hon Sir Mark Lennox-Boyd"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Hon.
