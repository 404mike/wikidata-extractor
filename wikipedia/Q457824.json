Hunter-Reay inherited the lead when several other drivers who had led the race, such as Dario Franchitti and Takuma Sato, were involved in crashes. Rain came in the late stages of the race. On lap 220 of 225 Hunter-Reay was leading Oriol Servi\u00e0 when the race was restarted and almost immediately teammate Danica Patrick spun due to the rain and collected several cars making the race go back to a caution. During this time Servi\u00e0 took the lead. INDYCAR officials decided to revert the results to lap 215 when the race was under caution for the rain. Hunter-Reay's best finish following the New Hampshire race was a 5th at the Kentucky Indy 300 at Kentucky Speedway.

Writing for Vice, James Newbold commented that the signing of Jorda had been \"the wrong message\", suggesting she got the position based on her looks rather than her performances in GP3, where she finished 29th in 2014, while only the series winner Alex Lynn also secured a spot with a Formula One team for 2015. In an interview with Motorsport.com, Jord\u00e1 spoke of her surprise at Mouton's comments and her ambition to invite her to an F1 race so \"she can better understand exactly what her plans are with Lotus\". In April 2015, Jord\u00e1 spoke out in favour of a separate championship for women, saying: \"It's not fair that women have to compete in the same championship as men, because we're never going to become World Champion, and I think women deserve that chance.\" Her view was criticised by other female racing drivers, such as ADAC Formula 4 participant Sophia Fl\u00f6rsch and Indianapolis 500 driver Pippa Mann.", "In December 2017, Jord\u00e1 was appointed to the FIA's Women in Motorsport commission.
