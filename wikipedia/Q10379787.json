However, a terrible run of form late in the season put them into the relegation battle, which they did not earn definite safety from until the penultimate match of the season. The club finished 19th that season, their lowest finish in 15 years. In the 2014\u201315 season, Cooper resigned a few weeks into the campaign following a 3\u20130 home defeat to Carlisle United which left Hartlepool at the bottom of the Football League. Paul Murray replaced Cooper, only to be sacked just two months later, with the club six points adrift at the bottom of League Two, and having just suffered an FA Cup elimination at the hands of non-league Blyth Spartans.  Ken Hodcroft, resigned and sold the club to Peter Harris in December 2014. Harris' first decision was to appoint former Tranmere Rovers manager Ronnie Moore to the managers' job. The takeover ultimately fell through due to Harris and his associates being involved in dubious activities with the club reverting to Hodcroft's ownership.  After being ten points adrift in bottom place at the turn of the year, in what has been termed the \"great escape\" and \"miracle\", a revival in form saw Hartlepool escape the relegation places and secure survival in the penultimate game of the season.", "* 2012  Paul Murray"]}, {"page": "Paul Murray", "response": ["Paul Murray may refer to:", "* Paul Murray (admiral), South African Vice Admiral", "* Paul Murray (author) (born 1975), Irish author of the book An Evening of Long Goodbyes", "* Paul Murray (businessman) (born 1964), current director and former interim chairman of Rangers F.C.", "* Paul Murray (footballer) (born 1976), English football player", "* Paul Murray (journalist) (born 1950), journalist and former editor of The West Australian", "* Paul Murray (musician), Canadian musician, member of the band Sandbox", "* Paul Murray (poet) (born 1947), Irish poet", "* Paul Murray (presenter) (born 1978), Australian radio and television presenter currently at Sky News Australia", "* Paul Murray (skier) (born 1977), cross-country skier representing Australia at the 2006 Winter Olympics"]}, {"page": "Stephen Pears", "response": ["On 4 July 2014, Pears was announced as assistant manager and goalkeeping coach at Hartlepool United.
