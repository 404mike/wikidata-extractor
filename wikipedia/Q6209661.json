New signings Billy Bottrill, Bill Ellerington and Joseph O'Beirne went straight into the starting line-up but they could not prevent Southport winning by a single goal from Jack Barber,  giving them their first ever League win against Nelson. A week later, Nelson played their first home game of the season, in which James Phizacklea made his debut for the club. A crowd of around 6,000 saw Ashington beaten 4\u20130 thanks to goals from Bottrill, Joe Eddleston, Jack Newnes and Sid Hoad. Three days later, Eddleston scored twice as Doncaster Rovers were defeated by three goals to nil in the first midweek match of the campaign. However, Nelson could not continue their winning streak as they lost 0\u20132 against Accrington Stanley at Peel Park in the following fixture. On 16 September, Nelson achieved their biggest victory in the Football League at that time with a 7\u20131 win over Durham City at Seedhill. The game saw Eddleston score his first hat-trick since the 3\u20130 victory away at Rochdale in January 1923, and O'Beirne and Eddie Cameron score their first goals of the season. Four days later, Nelson suffered their third consecutive defeat away from home, losing 0\u20133 to Barrow at Holker Street.

The first of these games ended in a 2\u20131 defeat away at Crewe Alexandra, despite Newnes' first goal since September. John Stevenson then scored his second Nelson goal the following day in a 1\u20131 draw with Bradford Park Avenue. On 13 April, the team avenged their loss to Crewe with a comprehensive 7\u20130 victory at Seedhill, their biggest winning margin in the Football League. Joe Eddleston opened the scoring and went on to net his third hat-trick of the season, taking his tally of goals to 25, a total that would never be beaten during Nelson's time in the League.Dykes (2009), p. 34 The other goals were added by Laycock, who scored twice, Chadwick and Cameron, who netted his last goal for Nelson. However, the team then took just three out of an available ten points at the end of the season, ending their hopes of returning to the Second Division.
