Not only was the Board of Deputies at London the sole Jewish body in Europe to hold public meetings, but owing to their influence a meeting of protest was held by eminent Christians at the Mansion House, London (3 July 1840), which formed a precedent for subsequent distinguished gatherings. Sir Moses Montefiore, after aiding the Damascus Jews by obtaining, in an interview with the Sultan at Constantinople, a firman repudiating the blood accusation, visited Russia in 1846 to intercede for his coreligionists there. In 1860 he went to Rome in connection with the Mortara affair; and in 1863 he led a mission to Morocco on behalf of Jews of that country. Action was likewise taken by the chief English Jews in behalf of the unfortunate Hebrews of the Danubian principalities. Francis Goldsmid made an interpellation in the House of Commons with regard to the Jews of Serbia (29 March 1867), and started a debate in that assembly (19 April 1872) on the subject of the persecutions of the Jews in Romania. As a consequence a Romanian committee was formed, which watched the activities of the illiberal government of that country."]}, {"page": "Reading (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Sir Francis Goldsmid"]}, {"page": "Rendcomb College", "response": ["The original college buildings consist of a large mansion built in 1865 by Sir Francis Goldsmid of the Goldsmid family (presumably d'Avigdor-Goldsmid) and designed by the well-known architect Philip Hardwick; the Stable Block (which is now the centre for Science, Maths, Languages, ICT and Geography teaching in the college) and the Old Rectory."]}, {"page": "1833 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* Francis Goldsmid is the first Jew to become an English barrister."]}, {"page": "FH Goldsmid", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Goldsmid"]}, {"page": "Francis Pigott Stainsby Conant", "response": ["As a requirement of his appointment he was obliged to resign his parliamentary seat.
