The road through the wood was so entirely blocked that they were obliged to abandon their carriage and proceed on foot. As they reached the part of the wood nearest to The Hague the trees were falling on all sides [...] one fell from a direction from which they did not expect it. The Baron seized hold of the Hereditary prince who was walking right next to him and pulled him out of danger, but Prince Alexander was caught by the branches and thrown down. It was some time before help was obtainable to extricate him, for it had to be done by digging away the ground.\"Disbrowe, p. 250. After the branches had been removed, Alexander, bleeding and unconscious, was carried back to the palace. \"At first,\" wrote Disbrowe, \"he was not much hurt, but after some hours fever and delirium set in, and he was very seriously ill.\"Disbrowe, p. 251.
