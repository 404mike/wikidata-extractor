The locations of the heists vary. Railway trains were plundered in the Great Gold Robbery and the Great Train Robbery and in 1935 there was a robbery at the Croydon Aerodrome. Exhibition spaces such as the Ashmolean Museum, the Christ Church Picture Gallery, the Harley Gallery, the National Gallery and the Whitworth Art Gallery, and stately homes such as Blenheim Palace, Drumlanrig Castle, Ramsbury Manor and Waddesdon Manor have all suffered losses. Graff jewellery shops in London have been attacked several times, alongside other shops in Bond Street and Hatton Garden. Banks, secure warehouses and vaults were targeted in the cases of the Brink's-Mat robbery, the Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary, the Knightsbridge Security Deposit robbery, the Northern Bank Robbery and the Securitas depot robbery. Regarding artworks, the Portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III by Rembrandt has been stolen a total of four times. Other paintings subject to theft include works by C\u00e9zanne, Goya and Henry Moore. The perpetrators range from individuals such as Kempton Bunton to syndicates like the Pink Panthers.", "The Portrait of the Duke of Wellington by Goya was stolen in 1961 from the National Gallery in London. Four years later, Kempton Bunton returned the painting and later gave himself up to the police, although it was revealed long after his death that it was actually his son who had taken the artwork. Other stolen artworks include C\u00e9zanne's View of Auvers-sur-Oise (not recovered) and Gainsborough's Portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (recovered). The artist cast of the sculpture Reclining Figure 1969\u201370 by Henry Moore was stolen in 2005 and it is most likely to have been sold as scrap metal. America was a golden toilet made as an artwork by Maurizio Cattelan. When it was stolen in 2019, it had been plumbed in to the water mains at Blenheim Palace, where it was being exhibited. Cattelan said the thieves were \"great performers\"."]}]}}
