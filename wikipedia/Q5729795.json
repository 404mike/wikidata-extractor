His many books include The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper, The Official Encyclopedia of Scotland Yard, Serial Killers, and The Murder Guide to London.  He is also one of the authors of The complete Jack the Ripper A to Z.After leaving Balliol College, Oxford, in 1966, where he had been a junior research fellow in English, he went to the University of Leeds where he lectured in English until 1973.  In 1971 he went to Michigan State University in the USA where he was a visiting associate professor for one year, and in 1973 he became a reader in English Literature and head of the English department at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus, Barbados. In the West Indies he was active in theatre and educational broadcasting.\nIn 1983 he returned to England and became a freelance writer and broadcaster, specialising in true crime. He broadcast a weekly radio programme called Murder After Midnight on London's LBC Radio from 1987 to 2001, some of which were produced and released commercially on cassette and CD by his friend (and fellow LBC broadcaster) Paul Savory.  Aside from his many true crime books he has also written illustrated biographies of Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, Rudyard Kipling and Oscar Wilde, and books on Agatha Christie, and Sherlock Holmes. He translated Louis Cazamian's Le Roman Social en Angleterre, and his play Let's Go Bajan! was performed successfully in Barbados and London.\nA number of Murder After Midnight stories are available on iTunes with additional titles planned for early 2013 release.\nIn 2000 he settled in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, to help his third wife (Karen, n\u00e9e Sandel, died October 2013) nurse her parents through their terminal illnesses, and from 2001 until his death he taught writing and research at Boston University.\nMartin Fido died on 2 April 2019 of complications resulting from having suffered a fall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jeremy Beadle", "response": ["In 1995, Beadle wrote the foreword to Who Was Jack the Ripper?, a collection of theories and observations about the Victorian serial murderer, published by the veteran true crime book dealer Camille Woolf.

He died at the asylum in October 1889.Fido, p. 220 In his book The Cases That Haunt Us, former FBI criminal profiler John Douglas has asserted that behavioural clues gathered from the murders all point to a person \"known to the police as David Cohen\u00a0... or someone very much like him\".Douglas and Olshaker, pp. 79\u201380"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Stride", "response": ["In his book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, author Stephen Knight linked the prominent physician Sir William Gull to Stride on the basis that both were reported to carry grapes; a theory which another author, Martin Fido, has dismissed as a \"wild allegation\"."]}, {"page": "Catherine Eddowes", "response": ["Major Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, claimed in his memoirs to have discovered bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly running out of the basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before.

Macnaghten's notes say that \"Kosminski\" indulged in \"solitary vices\", and in his memoirs Anderson wrote of his suspect's \"unmentionable vices\",Fido, p. 170 both of which may match the claim in the case notes that Aaron Kosminski committed \"self-abuse\".e.g. Fido, p. 229 Swanson's notes match the known details of Aaron Kosminski's life in that he reported that the suspect went to the workhouse and then to Colney Hatch,Begg, p. 273 but the last detail about his early death does not match Aaron Kosminski, who lived until 1919 (see below).Whitehead and Rivett, p. 109", "Anderson claimed that the Ripper had been identified by the \"only person who had ever had a good view of the murderer\", but that no prosecution was possible because both the witness and the culprit were Jews and Jews were not willing to offer testimony against fellow Jews.
