He trained in England as a chemist and upon moving to Dublin received a post with the City Analyst. In 1906 he began work at the Natural History Museum in the city, transferring to the Fisheries branch of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Information in 1911. In 1919 he was promoted to the rank of Assistant Inspector of Fisheries, a post he held until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest William Lyons Holt", "response": ["Holt joined the Marine Biological Association (MBA) and worked until 1894 at Grimsby, where he was in charge of a newly opened research station for the North Sea. After a brief stint at the Station zoologique d'Endoume at Marseille he then worked for three years at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory. Nevertheless, E. W. L. Holt maintained his ties with Ireland, and in 1895 he purchased a dismasted brigantine named Saturn for the Royal Dublin Society and had it equipped as a marine biology research station. In 1899, he returned to Ireland, taking charge of the Saturn and her four small auxiliary sailing boats used for sampling. The floating laboratory was stationed in the Connemara district in County Galway; it lay at Ballynakill in winter and was towed to Inishbofin for the summer months. In 1900, the Saturn was transferred to the new Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland. Green became Chief Inspector of its Fisheries Branch; Holt was at first scientific advisor and later, as of 1908, Fisheries Inspector. They were joined by other young biologists, among them Rowland Southern and George Philip Farrar."]}, {"page": "Clare Island Survey", "response": ["*Part 47 Archiannelida and Polychaeta   Rowland Southern (also marine dredging)", "*Part 48 Gephyrea   Rowland Southern", "*Part 49 Oligochaeta   Rowland Southern", "*Part 50 Hirudinea   Rowland Southern", "*Part 54 Nemathelmia, Kinorhyncha, and Chaetognatha   Rowland Southern", "*Part 55: Nemertinea   Rowland Southern", "*Part 56 Platyhelmia   Rowland Southern"]}, {"page": "Rowland (given name)", "response": ["*Rowland Southern (1882\u20131935), English biologist"]}, {"page": "Annie Massy", "response": ["Due to her membership of the Dublin Naturalists' Field Club, and the knowledge she developed, in 1901 she was employed as a temporary Assistant Naturalist as part of the fisheries division of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction (DATI). She was employed on this basis until her death in 1931. The period from 1901-1914 was particularly productive for Irish marine biology with extensive investigations of the Irish coasts. This included the expeditions of HMS Helga which engaged in trawling, dredging and tow-netting. Through this work she would have collaborated with Jane Stephens, Maude Delap, Edgar W.L. Holt and Rowland Southern. Her international reputation in the identification of marine species led to specimens being sent to her from all over the world."]}]}}
