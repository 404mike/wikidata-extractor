A dire opening to the 1924\u201325 season led Mitchell to step down in December 1924, with Fred Halliday assuming the manager's job for the third and final time and being forced to sue for re-election at the end of the season. Halliday remained in charge for 1925\u201326, which despite an 18th-place finish and a club-record 94 league goals conceded, promised much for the future with the breakthrough of forwards Ernie Watkins, Jack Lane and Alfred Douglas. In 1925, Brentford's white shirts were changed to the traditional red and white stripes."]}]}}
