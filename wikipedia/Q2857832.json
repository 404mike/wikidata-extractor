She also spots Tony flirt with Abigail, much to Jal's disgust. Her clarinet is broken by Sid's drug dealing enemy Madison Twatter, who smashes it before being chased away by her brothers Ace and Lynton (who are subsequently beaten into hospital).

In \"Sid\" she is critical of Sid for how he treats Cassie and is there to take Cassie to hospital after an overdose. She tells the doctors that she is Cassie's sister, and gets rid of Sid, with whom she is angry, hoping Cassie will recover. In \"Maxxie and Anwar\", she tries to inform Michelle that Tony cheated on her with Abigail but she does not listen.
