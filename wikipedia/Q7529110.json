He was known to family and friends as \"Charlie\", but demanded to be known in public as \"Sir Thomas\", not only because that was the traditional name of the Aclands, there having been a \"Sir Thomas Acland\" at Killerton for 170 years, but also because following the creation of a second and much newer Acland Baronetcy (\"of St Mary Magdalen in Oxford\") in 1890, for his uncle Sir Henry Wentworth Acland, 1st Baronet (the fourth son of the tenth Baronet), he wished people to know \"which was the real head and owner of Killerton\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
