He was known to family and friends as \"Charlie\", but demanded to be known in public as \"Sir Thomas\", not only because that was the traditional name of the Aclands, there having been a \"Sir Thomas Acland\" at Killerton for 170 years, but also because following the creation of a second and much newer Acland Baronetcy (\"of St Mary Magdalen in Oxford\") in 1890, for his uncle Sir Henry Wentworth Acland, 1st Baronet (the fourth son of the tenth Baronet), he wished people to know \"which was the real head and owner of Killerton\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 12th Baronet, MP 1882\u201392.

Above it is Efford Down, on which in 1835 the 10th Baronet built the surviving octagonal tower known as the \"Storm Tower\", whose sides face the cardinal and sub-cardinal points of the compass. It was designed by George Wightwick, inspired by the Tower of the Winds in Athens, and is believed to have served as a refuge for coastguards. In 1826 the 10th Baronet also built at Bude the \"Falcon Hotel\", named after the Acland crest of a falcon perched on a man's gloved hand. The Cornish estates were however difficult to manage economically as they were so far from Killerton, near Exeter.Acland, Anne. A Devon Family: The Story of the Aclands. London and Chichester: Phillimore, 1981, pp. 61, 139 Shortly before 1844 the 10th Baronet restored the Great Hall and the Chamber at Trerice and in 1844 the local newspaper reported \"Sir T. D. Acland held his Baronial Court at Trerice ... about 150 of his tenantry dined with the worthy Baronet in the noble Hall at Trerice, which has recently been restored to its original condition, and is a very fine specimen of the Elizabethan age\". The Aclands later leased Trerice with 500 acres to the Tremaine family, who farmed the estate with a staff of twelve men, four women and four boys. In 1915 Trerice was sold by the 10th baronet's grandson Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 12th Baronet (1842\u20131919)Acland, Anne. A Devon Family: The Story of the Aclands.
