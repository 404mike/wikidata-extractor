Both it and the follow-up, Stasi Wolf, were longlisted for the Theakston's Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year Award in 2016 and 2017 respectively. In 2017, Bonnier Zaffre, the UK adult fiction division of the Bonnier Group, announced Young had signed a six-figure deal for three further novels in the series, making five in all, with the third, A Darker State, being published in February 2018. Young says the inspiration for the series came after his indie pop band The Candy Twins toured Germany in 2007 and he read Anna Funder's non-fiction book Stasiland between gigs. He secured the tour thanks to favourable comments made by Edwyn Collins about a tribute song Young wrote about him. Before becoming a full-time novelist, Young was a news producer and editor for more than 25 years with BBC World Service radio and BBC World TV.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Young", "response": ["* David Young (Canadian playwright) (born 1946), Canadian playwright and novelist", "* David Young (novelist) (born 1958), British novelist", "* David Young (judge), daytime court television show judge in Miami", "* Judge David Young, daytime court television show", "* David Young (TV producer), British game show producer", "* David Young (Neighbours), fictional character on Australian soap opera Neighbours", "* David Young, founding editor of the Farmers' Almanac, 1818", "* David Young, writer and actor for CollegeHumor web site", "* David Young (saxophonist, 1912-1992), American jazz tenor saxophonist", "* David Young (musician) (active from 1990), American recorder musician", "* David Young (composer), American video game music composer", "* David Young (Labour politician) (1930\u20132003), British Labour Party MP, 1974\u20131997", "* David Young, Baron Young of Graffham (born 1932), British politician and Cabinet minister from the 1980s", "* David Young (Ontario politician) (born 1957), Canadian politician in Ontario", "* David Young (Watergate) (born 1936), member of a covert ops team under U.S. President Richard Nixon", "* David Young (Iowa politician) (born 1968), former member of the U.S. House of Representatives", "* David Young (North Carolina politician) (born 1959), businessman and Chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party", "* David Young III (1905\u20131977), American politician in New Jersey", "*David Young (Louisiana politician), state senator (African American officeholders during and following the Reconstruction era)", "* David Young (footballer, born 1945), English footballer for Newcastle, Sunderland, Charlton, and Southend in the 1970s", "* David Young (Australian footballer) (born 1954), Australian rules footballer for South Melbourne and Collingwood", "* David Young (footballer, born 1965), English footballer for Darlington in the 1980s", "* David Young (gridiron football) (born 1979), defensive back selected in the 2003 NFL Draft", "* David Young (swimmer) (1907\u20131988), American Olympic swimmer", "* David Young (wrestler) (born 1972), American professional wrestler", "* David Young (cricketer) (born 1977),  English cricketer", "* David Young (basketball) (born 1981), drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics", "* David Young (hurler) (born 1985), Irish sportsperson", "* David Young (rower), English rower", "* David Young (bishop) (1931\u20132008), British Anglican bishop; Bishop of Ripon", "* David Young (cleric) (1844\u20131913), Wesleyan minister and historian", "* David Young (British Army officer) (1926\u20132000), General Officer Commanding Scotland", "* David Young (bomber), former policeman who took hostages at an elementary school in Cokeville, Wyoming, 1986"]}, {"page": "CWA Historical Dagger", "response": ["* 2016: Stasi Child (Twenty7Books) \u2013 David Young"]}, {"page": "Stasi Child", "response": ["Stasi Child is a novel by David Young which won the 2016 CWA Endeavour Historical Dagger for the best historical crime novel of the year.
