Leadbeater had noticed Krishnamurti on the Society's beach on the Adyar river, and was amazed by the \"most wonderful aura he had ever seen, without a particle of selfishness in it.\" Ernest Wood, an adjutant of Leadbeater's at the time, who helped Krishnamurti with his homework, considered him to be \"particularly dim-witted\".Lutyens (1975), p. 21. Leadbeater was convinced that the boy would become a spiritual teacher and a great orator; the likely \"vehicle for the Lord Maitreya\" in Theosophical doctrine, an advanced spiritual entity periodically appearing on Earth as a World Teacher to guide the evolution of humankind."]}, {"page": "Tulsidas", "response": ["The historian Vincent Smith, the author of a biography of Tulsidas' contemporary Akbar, called Tulsidas the greatest man of his age in India and greater than even Akbar himself.Lutgendorf 1991, pp. 29.Dwivedi 2009, p. 125. The Indologist and linguist Sir George Grierson called Tulsidas \"the greatest leader of the people after the Buddha\" and \"the greatest of Indian authors of modern times\"; and the epic Ramcharitmanas \"worthy of the greatest poet of any age.\" The work Ramcharitmanas has been called \"the Bible of North India\" by both nineteenth century Indologists including Ralph Griffith, who translated the four Vedas and Valmiki's Ramayana into English, and modern writers.Growse 1914, p. Cover: \"The Ramayan of Tulsi Das is more popular and more honoured by the people of North-Western provinces than the Bible is by the corresponding classed in England\", Griffith.Macfie 2004, p. vii: The choice of the subtitle is no exaggeration. The book is indeed the Bible of Northern India. Mahatma Gandhi held Tulsidas in high esteem and regarded the Ramcharitmanas as the \"greatest book in all devotional literature\". The Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala' called Tulsidas \"the most fragrant branch of flowers in the garden of the world's poetry, blossoming in the creeper of Hindi\". Nirala considered Tulsidas to be a greater poet than Rabindranath Tagore, and in the same league as Kalidasa, Vyasa, Valmiki, Homer, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and William Shakespeare. Hindi litterateur Hazari Prasad Dwivedi wrote that Tulsidas established a \"sovereign rule on the kingdom of Dharma in northern India\", which was comparable to the impact of Buddha. Edmour J. Babineau, author of the book Love and God and Social Duty in Ramacaritmanasa, says that if Tulsidas was born in Europe or the Americas, he would be considered a greater personality than William Shakespeare.Pandey 2008, p. 12. In the words of the archaeologist F. R. Allchin, who translated Vinaypatrika and Kavitavali into English, \"for people of a large part of North India Tulsidas claims reverence comparable to that accorded to Luther as translator of the Bible into the native German\". Allchin also mentions that the work Ramcharitmanas has been compared to not only the Ramayana of Valmiki, but the Vedas themselves, the Bhagavad Gita, the Quran and the Bible.Prasad 2008, p. xix. Ernest Wood in his work An Englishman Defends Mother India considered the Ramcharitmanas to be \"superior to the best books of the Latin and Greek languages.\"Prasad 2008, p. xxiv. Tulsidas is also referred to as Bhakta\u015biroma\u1e47i, meaning the highest jewel among devotees.Shukla 2002, p. 27"]}, {"page": "Theosophical Society in America", "response": ["By way of comparison, the modern Theosophical Society in America bases its studies on Helena Blavatsky, but draws from a broad group of other Theosophical teachers, including Annie Besant, Alfred Percy Sinnett, Charles Webster Leadbeater, Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa, Ernest Wood, Clara Codd, Geoffrey Hodson, Nilakanta Sri Ram, Joy Mills, Radha Burnier, Stephan A.
