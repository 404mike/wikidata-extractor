In his next game Kitchener scored against Sheffield United, hitting a 30-yard screamer past former England goalkeeper Alan Hodgkinson. On the return of Cripps to the side, he played in every game that season at centre half, retaining the number five shirt until his retirement in 1982. His total of 602 appearances remains a club record. He released an autobiographical DVD titled 60 Minutes with Barry Kitchener, and in May 2007 was voted by fans to represent Millwall in the P.F.A.

This was a team that included; goalkeeper Bryan King, defender Harry Cripps, goalscoring midfielder Derek Possee, Millwall's most capped international player to date, Eamon Dunphy and the club's longest serving player, Barry Kitchener. They missed out on promotion to Division One by one point. By remaining unbeaten at home in Division Two for the 1971\u201372 season, Millwall became the only club to go through an entire season without losing a match at home in four different divisions 1927\u201328 Division Three South, 1964\u201365 Division Four, 1965\u201366 Division Three and 1971\u201372 Division Two.

The club's widest victory margin in the league is 9\u20131, a scoreline which they achieved twice in their Football League Third Division South championship-winning year of 1927.

Instead he made a surprise \u00a395,000 move to Third Division side Millwall, who were able to match Sunderland's wages and also pay out a \u00a330,000 signing on fee and a \u00a310,000 loyalty bonus. Millwall player-manager Peter Anderson had seen Allardyce as the successor to long-serving central defender Barry Kitchener, and as Anderson was also a property developer he allowed Allardyce to live rent free in a six-bedroom mansion. The \"Lions\" ended the 1981\u201382 season in mid-table, and Anderson was sacked in November 1982. Chairman Alan Thorne offered Allardyce the vacant management position, but Allardyce rejected the offer as he felt that at aged 28 he was far too young to enter management. Instead it was George Graham who took up his first management position, and Graham immediately froze Allardyce out of the first team on both matchdays and training after Allardyce insisted that he would not report teammates who broke Graham's rules. He came close to joining Charlton Athletic on a free transfer in March 1983, but Charlton boss Lennie Lawrence did not complete the move before the end of the transfer deadline. Graham agreed to pay Allardyce \u00a315,000 to cancel his contract, acting under the assumption that Allardyce would struggle to find a club willing to offer him \u00a3300 a week."]}]}}
