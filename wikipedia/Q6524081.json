Soon afterwards he started spending much of his time in Venice, Italy, and he continued to do so for many years. He travelled there with his aristocratic circle, eventually buying a home next to the church of San Sebastiano. A statue of Saint Sebastian outside the church, with arrows piercing his body, had a great influence on Hartley, as he would soon come to see the saint as \"a symbol of mankind\". While there, he owned a gondola, had his own personal gondolier, and was known to spend entire days on the canals. He also entertained many guests \u2013 including the painter  Henry Lamb, the art critic Adrian Stokes, and the novelist Leo Myers \u2013 and often set his writing aside to focus on social events."]}, {"page": "Leopold Myers", "response": ["#REDIRECT Leo Myers"]}, {"page": "Myers", "response": ["*Leo Myers (1881\u20131944), British novelist"]}, {"page": "Gai Eaton", "response": ["Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, and raised in London under the name Gai, Eaton was the son of the married Francis Errington and his mistress, Ruth; to hide her son's illegitimacy, Ruth claimed that she had been married to a Canadian, Charles Eaton (an invention of Errington's, by then supposedly deceased), and that Charles had fathered the child.
