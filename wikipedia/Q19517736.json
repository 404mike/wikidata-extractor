He installed a new team of top-tier senior management and 125 senior underwriters to execute his vision of tighter efficiencies and smarter risk-taking. He also eliminated AIG's prior separation into commercial and consumer businesses, instead restructuring the company into three new units: General Insurance, Life and Retirement, and a stand-alone technology unit called Blackboard Insurance which had been Hamilton's U.S. division acquired by AIG upon his hiring.", "In May 2017, Duperreault was hired as CEO of AIG, following Peter Hancock's March 2017 announcement to step down under pressure after what had been a significant period of disappointing financial results. Since late 2008 the AIG conglomerate had sold off many of its businesses to pay off the $185 billion U.S. government bailout it received during the 2008 financial crisis. It was still struggling financially, its profit margins were notably low, it had had a decade of significant underwriting losses, and in addition to the loss of numerous businesses it had lost clients, reputation, talented people, and morale. Duperreault was its seventh CEO in 12 years."]}, {"page": "Peter Hancock (CEO)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Hancock (businessman)"]}, {"page": "Peter Hancock (disambiguation)", "response": ["Peter Hancock (born 1955) is a British Anglican bishop", "Peter Hancock may also refer to:", "* Peter Hancock (businessman), former president and chief executive officer of AIG", "* Peter Hancock (footballer) (1931\u20132020), Australian rules footballer", "* Peter Hancock (professor) (born 1953), British-American scientist of human factors and ergonomics"]}]}}
