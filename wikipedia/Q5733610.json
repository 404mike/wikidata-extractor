He was a leading member of the English Hovevei Zion and one of the first followers of Theodor Herzl in England. In 1897 Bentwich led a group of 21, including the writer Israel Zangwill, on a tour of holy sites and new settlements in Palestine on behalf of the Maccabaeans, and in 1911 he acquired land for settlement at Gezer, near Ramleh, on behalf of the Maccabean Land Company. He later succeeded his brother-in-law Solomon J. Solomon as president of the Maccabaeans.\nBentwich was a founder of the British Zionist Federation in 1899 and for some time served as its vice-chairman. He was a legal adviser for the Jewish Colonial Trust. From 1916 to 1918 he served on the Zionist political advisory committee under Chaim Weizmann. Bentwich was a regular visitor to Palestine after 1921 and settled in Jerusalem in late 1929. \nSusannah Bentwich had died in London in 1915, and Herbert died at his home in Rehavia on 25 June 1932. He was survived by ten of his eleven children, eight of whom eventually settled permanently in Palestine.  His eldest son, Norman Bentwich, a leading barrister, also spent much of his professional life there, another son, Joseph Bentwich, was awarded the Israel Prize for education in 1962; and his daughter Thelma Yellin was a distinguished Israeli cellist. His great-grandson is Ari Shavit, the Israeli journalist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mount Scopus", "response": ["A small cemetery, dedicated to Herbert Bentwich and his family, is located beside the American Colony Cemetery in Tabachnik Garden."]}, {"page": "List of British Jews", "response": ["* Herbert Bentwich,New Yorker magazine \"My great-grandfather Herbert Bentwitch, a lawyer from a prominent English Jewish family\" Accessed 21 November 2006. lawyer and Zionist leader"]}, {"page": "Isaac Snowman", "response": ["In that year, 1897, he formed a group of English Jews known as the Maccabaeans, including Israel Zangwill and Herbert Bentwich, which undertook a pilgrimage to Palestine in the same year.

Greenberg", "response": ["Greenberg had expressed the wish that he should be cremated and his remains buried, without any religious ceremony, near Mount Scopus in Palestine. The casket containing his ashes arrived in Haifa in November 1931, but the Orthodox rabbinate in Jerusalem insisted that since Jewish law prohibits cremation, it could not be buried in consecrated ground. Letters flew back and forth between London and Palestine as his son Ivan tried to resolve the impasse. In January 1932, Joe Linton, one of Weizmann's aides, suggested burying the casket in Herbert Bentwich's private garden near Mount Scopus. This would have been a nice irony since the two men had loathed one another. In any event, this solution was over-ruled by the rabbinate. By May 1932, the casket was still in the customs office in Haifa, and officials threatened to throw it out if something was not done about it. Eventually, through the combined efforts of Moshe Sharett (later Foreign Minister and Prime Minister of Israel) and Chaim Arlosoroff, both high-ranking officials in the Jewish Agency, a resting place for Greenberg's remains was found at Kibbutz Degania by the shore of the Sea of Galilee."]}, {"page": "Joseph Bentwich", "response": ["Bentwich was born in 1902 in London, United Kingdom.
