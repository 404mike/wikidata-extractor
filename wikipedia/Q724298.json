Since his death, however, it has been established that the major source of his China Under the Empress Dowager is a forgery, most likely by Backhouse himself.His biographer, Hugh Trevor-Roper, unmasked Backhouse as \"a confidence man with few equals,\" who had also duped the British government, Oxford University, the American Bank Note Company and John Brown & Company.
