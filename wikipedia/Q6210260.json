He played in 27 of the club's 34 league matches in the 1899\u20131900 season, before joining fellow Second Division side Newton Heath in September 1900. He remained with the Heathens for almost three seasons, through their change of name to Manchester United in 1902. During his time there, he made 59 league appearances, including one as an emergency inside left in a 1\u20131 draw against Walsall on 25 February 1901; his selection in the forward line came as a result of the unavailability of William Jackson and his usual deputy Joe Heathcote, while James Garvey took over in goal.Dykes (1994), p. 399.Shury and Landamore (2005), p. 62."]}]}}
