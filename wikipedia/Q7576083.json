The building of the Great Western Railway in the 1830s, part of which passed through the centre of Ealing, led to the opening of a railway station on the Broadway in 1879, originally called Haven Green. In the next few decades, much of Ealing was rebuilt, predominantly semi-detached housing designed for the rising middle-class. Gas mains were laid and an electricity generating station was built. Better transport links, including horse buses as well as trains, enabled people to more easily travel to work in London. All this, whilst living in what was still considered to be the countryside. Although much of the countryside was rapidly disappearing during this period of rapid expansion, parts of it were preserved as public parks, such as Lammas Park and Ealing Common. Pitzhanger Manor and the extensive  grounds on which it stands, was sold to the council in 1901 by Sir Spencer Walpole, which had been bought by his father the Rt. Hon. Spencer Horatio Walpole and thus became Walpole Park."]}, {"page": "Spencer Perceval", "response": ["# Isabella (1801\u20131886) married her cousin Spencer Horatio Walpole in 1835 and was the only one of Perceval's daughters to have children.

They lived in the Hall on Ealing Green, next-door to Isabella's four unmarried sisters."]}, {"page": "Spencer Walpole", "response": ["He came of the younger branch of the de facto first prime minister, Robert Walpole who revived the Whig Party, being a patrilineal descendant of one of his brothers, the 1st Baron Walpole of Wolterton.  His father Spencer Horatio Walpole (1807\u20131898) was three times Home Secretary under the 14th Earl of Derby.  Through his mother he was a grandson of Spencer Perceval, the Tory prime minister. The only mainstream political parties in his lifetime which were at that time taking shape as the Liberal and Conservative parties were therefore closely connected to him at birth, and each party icon formed one half of his name."]}, {"page": "Cambridge Union", "response": ["* Spencer Horatio Walpole"]}, {"page": "Charles Bradlaugh", "response": ["This Select Committee held only one brief meeting on 12 May 1880. The Attorney General, Sir Henry James, moved that anyone entitled to affirm to give evidence in court was also entitled to affirm instead of taking the Oath in Parliament. Sir John Holker, Conservative MP for Preston, moved an amendment to reverse this finding, and the committee split down the middle with eight members (seven Conservatives and Charles Henry Hopwood, Liberal MP for Stockport) supporting the amendment and eight (all Liberals) opposing it; on the casting vote of the chairman Spencer Horatio Walpole the amendment was carried.Arnstein, p. 38; \"Report from the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Oath\" HCP 159 (1880). Bradlaugh was not surprised that the Committee had gone against him, and notified the Speaker that he would attend to take the Oath on 21 May."]}]}}
