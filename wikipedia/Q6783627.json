He made his first start of the campaign in the following game, a 5\u20131 League Cup thrashing by Peterborough United on 6 August. Gilbey was replaced by Sanchez Watt on 65 minutes when the U's were 2\u20131 down. He was utilised as a substitute in his next three games, a 1\u20130 win at home to Port Vale, a 1\u20131 home draw with Carlisle United and a 2\u20131 home loss to Leyton Orient. He then made only his second start of the season in the Football League Trophy clash with Dagenham & Redbridge on 3 September, a 4\u20131 defeat for Colchester. After this point, Gilbey began to cement his name in Joe Dunne's starting eleven, starting five days later in midfield for an injury ravaged U's side for a trip to Coventry City. United lost the match 2\u20130, but it gave Dunne plenty of positives to take away, where fellow youth product Tosin Olufemi featured and Mason Spence experienced his first taste of league football."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["Colchester's development squad was bolstered first by the signing of Milton Keynes Dons youth-team product Mason Spence, and the news that young striker Freddie Ladapo had signed a new one-year contract to remain with the club.
