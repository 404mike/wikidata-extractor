He was ordained by Richard Terrick, the Bishop of London, and was a curate under William Romaine at St Ann Blackfriars in London.  However, health problems caused him to return to Wales, where he became successively curate at St. Fagans and Porthkerry in Glamorgan, establishing Methodist societies in both places, and preaching to Methodists throughout South Wales. He travelled to his sister's house in Bristol in 1783 when his health worsened, and he died there of tuberculosis on 8 February 1784.  He was buried at St Athan, Glamorgan.  Tributes were paid to him by William Williams, Pantycelyn and others, and David Jones of Llangan, wrote a short biography titled 'Llythyr oddiwrth Dafydd ab Ioan y Pererin at Ioan ab Gwilim y Prydydd..., published at Trevecka in 1784."]}, {"page": "Richard Bassett (priest)", "response": ["Bassett was friends with the evangelical cleric William Howels, and through him met the Methodist cleric David Jones of Llangan.
