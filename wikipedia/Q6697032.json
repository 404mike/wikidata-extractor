They unveiled a new kit of red and white striped tops with blue kickers. The season opened with an \"exciting\" 2\u20132 draw with Burton Wanderers; the attendance at the Athletic Ground was a healthy 2,000, though Clare had trouble with his boots and played most of the match wearing just one of them. Two away defeats followed, and young reserve Frank Mitchell was then installed at centre-forward and proved an instant success, scoring a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 home win over Kettering. However four league defeats later the players and directors met to discuss what was going wrong; the 1\u20130 defeat by Barnsley St Peter's was a particular calamity as goalkeeper Tom Poole  punched the ball into his own net from an indirect free-kick.", "Vale found great success in the FA Cup, beating Football League Second Division side Small Heath 2\u20131 in the third qualification round thanks to a brace from Clare; Small Heath had originally proposed to switch the venue to Muntz Street for a \u00a3100 payment, but were refused. After a walkover victory against Kidderminster, they were fired by a \"special inducement\" and played \"with dash and skill\" to eliminate Burton Wanderers 2\u20131 to reach the first round proper. Eventual Football League First Division champions Sheffield United were expecting to romp to victory at Bramall Lane, but the Vale team were in confident mood and held out for a 1\u20131 draw, the home side only staying in the tie due to a dubious penalty. Vale rejected an offer of \u00a3250 to play the replay at Bramall Lane, and went on to win the tie 2\u20131; Dick Evans gave Vale a two minute lead before United equalised with a rush goal eight minutes from time. In extra-time, United goalkeeper William Foulke \"acted in an idiotic manner\" and was caught out of position as Vale's Billy Heames broke away, running half the length of the pitch before pulling the ball back for Lucien Boullemier to score the winning goal. Vale claimed earnings of \u00a3350 for the fixture as a crowd of 15,000 witnessed the giantkilling; the Burslem school board gave schoolchildren a special holiday so they could attend the game. Second Division leaders Burnley awaited in the second round, but Vale were below par as they slipped to a 3\u20130 defeat at Turf Moor.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Lucien Boullemier", "|\u2013||MF||||Lucien Boullemier||0||1||0||1", "| Summer 1897 || MF ||  || Lucien Boullemier || Stoke || Free transfer || "]}]}}
