Instead he made a surprise \u00a395,000 move to Third Division side Millwall, who were able to match Sunderland's wages and also pay out a \u00a330,000 signing on fee and a \u00a310,000 loyalty bonus. Millwall player-manager Peter Anderson had seen Allardyce as the successor to long-serving central defender Barry Kitchener, and as Anderson was also a property developer he allowed Allardyce to live rent free in a six-bedroom mansion. The \"Lions\" ended the 1981\u201382 season in mid-table, and Anderson was sacked in November 1982. Chairman Alan Thorne offered Allardyce the vacant management position, but Allardyce rejected the offer as he felt that at aged 28 he was far too young to enter management. Instead it was George Graham who took up his first management position, and Graham immediately froze Allardyce out of the first team on both matchdays and training after Allardyce insisted that he would not report teammates who broke Graham's rules. He came close to joining Charlton Athletic on a free transfer in March 1983, but Charlton boss Lennie Lawrence did not complete the move before the end of the transfer deadline. Graham agreed to pay Allardyce \u00a315,000 to cancel his contract, acting under the assumption that Allardyce would struggle to find a club willing to offer him \u00a3300 a week."]}, {"page": "Winston DuBose", "response": ["DuBose now runs a computer business in Florida with his former Rowdies teammate Peter Anderson.
