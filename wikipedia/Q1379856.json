He began publishing with two stories in the September 1964 issue of Science Fantasy magazine, \"Anita\" (the first of a series of stories featuring a teenage modern witch and her eccentric granny) and \"Escapism\".Several of his early stories were written using the pseudonym Alistair Bevan. His second novel, Pavane, which is a collection of linked stories, may be his most famous work: an alternate history novel in which the Catholic Church takes control of England following the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I.Roberts wrote numerous novels and short stories and worked as an illustrator. His artistic contributions include covers and interior artwork for New Worlds and Science Fantasy, later renamed Impulse. He also edited the last few issues of Impulse although the nominal editor was Harry Harrison.Roberts' first novel, The Furies, makes an appearance in the American TV series Bones in the third season's third episode \"Death in the Saddle\" (9 October 2007).\nRoberts described himself as a political conservative and \nan anti-communist.In later life, Roberts lived in Salisbury. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1990, and died of its complications in October 2000. Obituaries recalled him as a talented but personally \"difficult\" author, with a history of disputes with publishers, editors and colleagues.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alternate history", "response": ["On the other hand, when the \"Old Ones\" (fairies) still manifest themselves in England in Keith Roberts's Pavane, which takes place in a technologically backward world after a Spanish assassination of Elizabeth I allowed the Spanish Armada to conquer England, the possibility that the fairies were real but retreated from modern advances makes the POD possible: the fairies really were present all along, in a secret history.

Once Carnell took over, Science Fantasy typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included John Brunner, Ken Bulmer, and Brian Aldiss, whose first novel Nonstop appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during the latter half of the 1950s, and in the early 1960s Carnell began to publish Thomas Burnett Swann's well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of Science Fantasy was always higher than that of New Worlds, and in the early 1960s his efforts were rewarded with three consecutive Hugo nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including Keith Roberts, Brian Stableford and Josephine Saxton.  In the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, the final year of Impulse, as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.", "|colspan=\"13\" style=\"font-size: 8pt; text-align:left\"|Issues of Science Fantasy in the 1960s, showing volume/issue number, andcolor-coded to show who was editor for each issue. John Carnell was theeditor until April 1964, after which Kyril Bonfiglioli took over. The last five issueswere edited by Keith Roberts and Harry Harrison. Issues 65 through 69 weretitled with the name of two consecutive months\u2014e.g. issue 66 was datedJuly\u2013August 1964.", "Bonfiglioli often bought material from writers without an established reputation; he did not make any special effort to acquire stories from well-known names. He was known for writing long and helpful rejection letters to newcomers, but he also had a reputation for laziness, and much of the day-to-day editorial work was done by assistants\u2014first James Parkhill-Rathbone, and then Keith Roberts.", "By late 1966 Bonfiglioli had made enough money from his antiques dealing to be able to retire to Jersey. J.G. Ballard was briefly involved with the magazine in an editorial role, but his aims for the magazine were too far from the publisher's goals and he was quickly replaced by Harry Harrison. Harrison almost immediately had to leave England and handed over much of the day-to-day management of the magazine to Keith Roberts.Ashley, Transformations, pp.\u00a0245\u2013248. Despite the setback from Bonfiglioli's title change, the magazine was still profitable, but in July 1966 Roberts & Vinter's distributor, Thorpe & Porter, went bankrupt while owing Roberts & Vinter a substantial sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter to decide to focus on their more profitable magazines, and the February 1967 issue of SF Impulse was the last, though New Worlds, the sister magazine, survived via an Arts Council grant obtained by Brian Aldiss's efforts. The title was merged with New Worlds with effect from the March 1967 issue, but nothing of SF Impulses content was retained.", "When Kyril Bonfiglioli took over in 1964, he complained in his first editorial that he had \"just read through a quarter of a million words of ms [manuscript] and half of it was so bad it made me blush\". He asked Brian Aldiss to help; the only unsold stories Aldiss had were from his early days, \"written before I got the hang of things\", but Bonfiglioli told Aldiss, \"They can't possibly be worse than the rubbish that's being submitted\". Aldiss provided four stories for the first two issues, under his own name and two pseudonyms, \"Jael Cracken\" and \"John Runciman\". Bonfiglioli's third issue included Keith Roberts' first two stories: \"Escapism\", a time travel tale, and \"Anita\", the first in a series about a witch; Roberts became a frequent contributor both under his own name and as \"Alistair Bevan\", and also provided the artwork for several covers. The Day of the Minotaur, another historical fantasy by Thomas Burnett Swann, began serialisation in the same issue under the title The Blue Monkeys. Swann's novel The Weirwoods was also serialised in the magazine, with no change of title. Other new writers who began to appear under Bonfiglioli's editorship included Josephine Saxton and Brian Stableford. Bonfiglioli's focus on stories that he liked personally, rather than on a specific editorial policy, led author Christopher Priest to describe Science Fantasy under Bonfiglioli's editorship as \"a literate and charmingly eccentric magazine, with an atmosphere all its own\".Christopher Priest, \"New Wave\", in Holdstock, Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, p.\u00a0166.", "At the World Science Fiction Convention in 1965, held in London, Bonfiglioli persuaded several well-known writers to appear in an \"all-star issue ... with specially written stories round the theme of 'sacrifice. The issue in question was the first one under the new title of Impulse, in March 1966; it included fiction by James Blish, Brian Aldiss, Harry Harrison, J.G. Ballard, Poul Anderson, Jack Vance, and Keith Roberts, who contributed \"The Signaller\", the first story in his Pavane sequence. The second issue was also high quality, with another Pavane story and a short story by John Brunner from his \"Traveller in Black\" series. Subsequent issues did not sustain this high level, but overall, in Ashley's opinion, the twelve issues of Impulse contained \"some of the best SF and fantasy ever published in British magazines\". Christopher Priest's first story, \"The Run\", appeared in the May 1966 issue, and Chris Boyce's second story, \"George\", was published in June 1966. Two novels were serialised in Impulse, both well-received: Harry Harrison's Make Room! Make Room! (later made into the movie Soylent Green), and Moorcock's The Ice Schooner. Other stories listed by Ashley include Thomas Disch's \"The Roaches\" and \"The Number You Have Just Reached\", and Aldiss's \"The Eyes of the Blind King\". Stableford also praises the covers for the last few issues, which were mostly done by Keith Roberts in a semi-abstract style unlike conventional genre art.", "* Harry Harrison and Keith Roberts: October 1966 \u2013 February 1967."]}, {"page": "Victor Gollancz Ltd", "response": ["* Keith Roberts"]}, {"page": "List of fictional monarchs of real nations", "response": ["** Queen in Galliard by Keith Roberts (a pastiche of his novel Pavane), a novel-within-a-novel depicted in The Alteration by Kingsley Amis.", "====Pavane by Keith Roberts===="]}, {"page": "Orbit (anthology series)", "response": ["*\"The Deeps\" by Keith Roberts"]}, {"page": "Pavane (novel)", "response": ["Pavane is an alternative history science fiction fix-up novel by British writer Keith Roberts, first published by Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd in 1968.
