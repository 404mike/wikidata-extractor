In 1935\u201336 Dartford lost to a star-studded Derby County (then second in Division One) by 3\u20132 at the Baseball Ground having at one time led by 2\u20130. Leading player Fred Dell was transferred to West Ham United for a reported \u00a32,000 immediately after the game. The following season saw Dartford lose 0\u20131 at home to Darlington at the same stage. Towards the end of the decade Mr Collier, who had brought a distinctive Scottish flavour to Dartford, resigned to take over a business in Scotland and the period was seen out in a comparatively quiet vein."]}, {"page": "Albert Walker (footballer)", "response": ["Walker left in 1938 to join Doncaster Rovers along with Fred Dell in an exchange which took Arthur Banner down south. He made 37 League and 5 FA Cup appearances for Rovers, plus 3 appearances in the curtailed 1939\u201340 season. He spent World War II with the National Fire Service, and continued playing for Doncaster in the Wartime Leagues and cup competitions, making at least 81 appearances during that time, still without scoring. His last game for Rovers was on 16 December 1942 in a 1\u20131 draw at Barnsley."]}, {"page": "Arthur Banner", "response": ["Born in Sheffield, Banner started his football career with Doncaster Rovers where he made no league appearances but played 4 games in the Division 3 North Challenge Cup where Rovers lost in extra time in the semi-final. At the end of the season, he moved to West Ham United in exchange for Fred Dell and Albert Walker."]}]}}
