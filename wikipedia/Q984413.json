Due to its hardiness and fast growth, Spathoglottis plicata is cultivated and used in hybridizing with other mountain Spathoglottis that are difficult to grown in lowland to produce more interesting varieties. The first Spathoglottis hybrid was produced in 1932 by Richard Eric Holttum who crossed S. plicata with S. aurea and gave it the name Spathoglottis 'Primrose'. \u2018Dwarf Legion\u2019 is a hybrid of 'Primrose' and S. tomentosa, a dwarf form that produces many colours of flower, from pink to yellow, and pure cream."]}, {"page": "British Pteridological Society", "response": ["| Richard Eric Holttum (1895-1900)||1960-1963"]}, {"page": "Holtt.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Eric Holttum"]}, {"page": "Holttum", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Eric Holttum"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (H)", "response": ["* Holttum \u2013 Richard Eric Holttum (1895\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "Wee-Lek Chew", "response": ["Chew was born in Singapore in 1932.

A year later he went to the United Kingdom on a Singapore government fellowship to pursue a Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge, where his advisor was E. J. H. Corner. He completed his studies in 1960, and returned to the Singapore Botanic Gardens that year. He further received a postdoctoral fellowship in 1964. He became the director and ex officio chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Singapore Botanic Gardens in 1969 following the retirement of H. M. Burkill. He resigned the following year and moved to Australia to work at the Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney, and was succeeded as director by A. G. Alphonso. He was named a fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1974. In 1975 he resigned from his post at the National Herbarium of New South Wales to take up a position with the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Morges, Switzerland.
