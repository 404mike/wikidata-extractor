A 1\u20130 home defeat to Rotherham United at Griffin Park on 29 March left the Bees just two points above the relegation zone and the result spelt the end for manager Bill Dodgin Jr, who was given a paid leave of absence until the end of the season by the Brentford board. Former Woking manager Fred Callaghan was appointed to the position and oversaw something of a revival, though Brentford went into the final match of the season versus Millwall needing at least a point to guarantee safety. A goal from one of Bill Dodgin Jr.'s final signings, Tony Funnell, was enough to preserve Brentford's Third Division status.Croxford, Lane & Waterman, p. 198.", "|Tony Funnell", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Tony Funnell", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Tony Funnell", "| Tony Funnell"]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Tony Funnell", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Tony Funnell", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Tony Funnell"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["| Tony Funnell"]}]}}
