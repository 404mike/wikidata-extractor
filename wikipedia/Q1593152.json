Chadwick was the Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and the founder and head of the Department for Anglo-Saxon and Kindred Studies at the University of Cambridge. Chadwick was well known for his encouragement of interdisciplinary research on Celts and Germanic peoples, and for his theories on the Heroic Age in the history of human societies. Chadwick was a tutor of many notable students and the author of numerous influential works in his fields of study. Much of his research and teaching was conducted in cooperation with his wife, former student and fellow Cambridge scholar Nora Kershaw.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thornhill, West Yorkshire", "response": ["* Hector Munro Chadwick, philologist and historian was born in Thornhill"]}, {"page": "\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in", "response": ["A number of Welsh traditions point to warfare between \u00c1ed\u00e1n and King Rhydderch Hael of Alt Clut, the northern Brittonic kingdom later known as Strathclyde.  Hector Munro Chadwick and subsequent historians suggest \u00c1ed\u00e1n was initially in a long-term alliance with Rhydderch and his predecessors, but that it eventually collapsed into conflict. Adomn\u00e1n reports that Rhydderch sent a monk named Luigbe to Iona to speak with Columba \"for he wanted to learn whether he would be slaughtered by his enemies or not\". A Welsh Triad names \u00c1ed\u00e1n's plundering of Alt Clut as one of the \"three unrestrained plunderings of Britain\", and the poem Peiryan Vaban tells of a battle between \u00c1ed\u00e1n and Rhydderch.Adomn\u00e1n, I, 15 and translator's note 89; Bannerman, pp. 88\u201389.

In 1884, Walter de Gray Birch wrote a paper for the British Archaeological Association, in which he discussed in detail the location of each of the tribes.
