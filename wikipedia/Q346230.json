Modern bleaches resulted from further work by Berthollet, who first produced sodium hypochlorite in 1789 in his laboratory in the town of Javel (now part of Paris, France), by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as \"Eau de Javel\" (\"Javel water\"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. This process was not very efficient, and alternative production methods were sought. Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant first produced a solution of calcium hypochlorite (\"chlorinated lime\"), then solid calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder). These compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water, it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer. Near the end of the nineteenth century, E. S. Smith patented a method of sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis of brine to produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite. This is known as the chloralkali process, first introduced on an industrial scale in 1892, and now the source of most elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide.Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 798 In 1884 Chemischen Fabrik Griesheim of Germany developed another chloralkali process which entered commercial production in 1888."]}, {"page": "Industrial Revolution", "response": ["The development of bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) by Scottish chemist Charles Tennant in about 1800, based on the discoveries of French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet, revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk. Tennant's factory at St Rollox, North Glasgow, became the largest chemical plant in the world."]}, {"page": "James Watt", "response": ["With McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach   of cloth to his satisfaction. About this time, Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it, so it became public knowledge. Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product. Watt's rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race. It was not until 1799, when Charles Tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) that it became a commercial success."]}, {"page": "May 3", "response": ["*1768 \u2013 Charles Tennant, Scottish chemist and businessman (d. 1838)"]}, {"page": "October 1", "response": ["*1838 \u2013 Charles Tennant, Scottish chemist and businessman (b. 1768)"]}, {"page": "1838", "response": ["* October 1 \u2013 Charles Tennant, Scottish chemist, industrialist (b. 1768)"]}, {"page": "1768", "response": ["* May 3 \u2013 Charles Tennant, Scottish chemist, industrialist (d. 1838)"]}, {"page": "Timeline of clothing and textiles technology", "response": ["*1799 \u2013 Charles Tennant discovers and patents bleaching powder."]}, {"page": "Chemical industry", "response": ["In the early 18th century, cloth was bleached by treating it with stale urine or sour milk and exposing it to sunlight for long periods of time, which created a severe bottleneck in production.

His powder was made by reacting chlorine with dry slaked lime and proved to be a cheap and successful product.
