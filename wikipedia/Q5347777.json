He was born at Clifton, Bristol, Bristol and died at Axbridge, Somerset.\nin his first-class matches for Somerset, Hall was usually a lower-order batsman and a bowler, though his batting and bowling styles are not known. In his final match for the county, the game against Hampshire in 1885, he finished not out at the end of the first innings and was then promoted to open the batting in the second innings, scoring 23, his highest first-class score. This was the game in which Somerset played with only nine men in their side, and at the end of that season they lost their first-class status, and Hall played for them no more.", "link_mentions": []}}
