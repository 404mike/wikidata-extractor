He drew the design for the Chopper on an envelope as he travelled home from the US, in 1967, inspired to replicate the design of Peter Fonda's character's motorbike in the film Easy Rider. He came up with his drawing as he flew home from the trip, set up for him to \"get-to-grips\" with youth culture. In the 1980s, production of the Chopper ceased when the rival BMX hit the market, but, due to popular demand, a limited edition Chopper was released in 2004.Oakley married twice. His first marriage, in 1954, was to Brenda Wilson; the couple had a son and daughter. Oakley was married to Karen Francis from 1992 until his death.
