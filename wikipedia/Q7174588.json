He signed professional forms on 28 March 1998 and made his first-team debut the following month against Norwich City in a 3\u20132 victory at Carrow Road on 4 April 1998 at the age of 18. He made two more appearances that season but none in the following season. After City won promotion to the Premier League in May 1999, Bower's first-team opportunities were restricted. Instead he spent a period on loan at York City in the 1999\u20132000 season, after he was signed by the club's new manager Terry Dolan, who had previously managed Bradford City. Dolan made a number of other defensive signings including Alan Fettis, Peter Swan and Peter Hawkins, and with Bower they helped to reduce the number of goals York conceded to help them avoid relegation. Bower made 15 appearances, scoring his first senior goal against Lincoln City during his spell."]}, {"page": "List of people from Kent", "response": ["*Peter Hawkins (born 1978) \u2013 footballer for Wimbledon, York City and Rushden & Diamonds"]}, {"page": "List of Maidstone United F.C. seasons", "response": ["||Peter Hawkins"]}, {"page": "2008 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|RB ||2 || Peter Hawkins"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Wimbledon F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Peter Hawkins"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Wimbledon F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Peter Hawkins"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Wimbledon F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Peter Hawkins"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Wimbledon F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Peter Hawkins"]}]}}
