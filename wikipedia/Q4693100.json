As is often the case with Gray's later stories, some of his own contributions are recycled from his previous writing, including The Story of a Recluse (based on his television play) and A Report to the Trustees of the Bellahouston Travelling Scholarship (based on report written after Gray received a grant to travel abroad as an art student).
