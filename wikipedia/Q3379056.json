He was one of the 'Wheatsheaf writers' of 1930s Fitzrovia (who took their name from a pub). \nIn his Memoirs of a Public Baby (1958, Faber and Faber) O'Connor wrote about his early life, which was \"shrouded in a good deal of mystery and make-believe\". According to O'Connor, his father, Bernard, was an Oxford-educated surgeon of sophisticated tastes, descended from the last High King of Ireland; he allegedly died early in the First World War whilst serving in the Navy. Notwithstanding O'Connor's account, \"neither the Admiralty, Oxford University nor the various doctors' registers are able to authenticate\" what he wrote. His mother considered his father \"riff-raff\" and \"a cad\". She was Winifred Xavier Rodyke-Thompson, of an Irish Roman Catholic family; she claimed her grandfather had been born into the Spring Rice family headed by Baron Monteagle of Brandon, later changing his name. During O'Connor's childhood, his mother founded the Somerset Cigarette Agency and secured a government contract to produce inferior cigarettes for supply to soldiers.Memoirs of a Public Baby was followed by The Lower View (1960), Living in Croesor (1962) and Vagrancy (1963). He was a heavy drinker and (at the very least) massively eccentric, living a mainly parasitic life. In his own words, he \"bathed in life and dried myself on the typewriter\".\nIn 1963, O'Connor interviewed an acquaintance, Quentin Crisp, for the BBC Third Programme. A publisher who happened to hear the broadcast was impressed by Crisp's performance, and as an indirect result of O'Connor's interview, Crisp ended up writing The Naked Civil Servant.He fathered \"an unknown number of attractive and intelligent children\", including Philip, Max, Sarah, Peter, John, Allaye, Patric, and Rachel, the eight children referenced in his obituary in The New York Times. His first wife, married in 1941, was lawyer's daughter Jean Mary Hore, who was sent to a mental hospital after an attempt on her husband's life; she lived until 1997, having been confined for over fifty years. Jean was also the unrequited love of Paul Potts, who wrote about her in Dante Called You Beatrice (1960). In 1963 O'Connor married secondly (Anne) Nicolle Gaillard-d'Andel; Memoirs of a Public Baby is dedicated to Anna Wing, the actress and his third partner with whom he had a son, Jon, an education consultant and former teacher. O'Connor met the American heiress Panna Grady in 1967 and settled with her in France; they never married.", "link_mentions": {}}}
