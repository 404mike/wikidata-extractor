However, the Romans repulsed the great invasion of Syria and Anatolia by Pacorus and Labienus, and were gradually able to take advantage of the weaknesses of the Parthian military system, which, according to George Rawlinson, was adapted for national defense but ill-suited for conquest. The Romans, on the other hand, were continually modifying and evolving their \"grand strategy\" from Trajan's time onwards, and were by the time of Pacorus able to take the offensive against the Parthians.Rawlinson (2007), 199: \"The Parthian military system had not the elasticity of the Romans\u00a0... However loose and seemingly flexible, it was rigid in its uniformity; it never altered; it remained under the thirtieth Arsaces such as it had been under the first, improved in details perhaps, but essentially the same system.\" According to Michael Whitby (2000), 310, \"the eastern armies preserved the Roman military reputation through to the end of the 6th century by capitalizing on available resources and showing a capacity to adapt to a variety of challenges\". Like the Sasanians in the late 3rd and 4th centuries, the Parthians generally avoided any sustained defense of Mesopotamia against the Romans. However, the Iranian plateau never fell, as the Roman expeditions had always exhausted their offensive impetus by the time they reached lower Mesopotamia, and their extended line of communications through territory not sufficiently pacified exposed them to revolts and counterattacks.Wheeler (2007), 259"]}, {"page": "Peter Heather", "response": ["*Peter Heather, 'State, Lordship and Community in the West (c.

In 598, Comentiolus was sent back into action against the Avars, probably with the position of magister militum per Thracias. After a heavy defeat caused by his neglect to properly array his forces for battle, his army was scattered and he himself fled to Constantinople, where he faced charges of treason. These were dropped at the Emperor's request, and Comentiolus was reconfirmed as general for Thrace. His subsequent record is not very distinguished, but according to Michael Whitby this may be more due to the negative bias of Simocatta, the main primary source for the period, towards him and his co-general Peter, rather than because of inability or inaction on his part. At any rate, when the army rebelled against Maurice in 602, Comentiolus was entrusted with the defence of the Walls of Constantinople. When Phocas eventually took the city, he was one of the first adherents of the old regime to be executed."]}, {"page": "Harry Sidebottom", "response": ["*Blackwell Encyclopedia of Ancient Battles (ed. with Michael Whitby) (2017)"]}, {"page": "Germanus (Caesar)", "response": ["According to Michael Whitby, Germanus was a patrician and governor of the praetorian prefecture of Africa.
