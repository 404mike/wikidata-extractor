Born in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, he was known by the nicknames Boy Boon and the Fen Tiger. Of a total of 119 fights, he won 92 (KO 62), lost 21 (KO 13) and drew 5.He beat Dave Crowley on 15 December 1938 to become British Lightweight Champion, a title he held for three years until 12 August 1944. His match against Arthur Danahar from the Harringay Arena was the first televised boxing match, broadcast on BBC television and shown live in several cinemas on 23 February 1939.Boon v Danaher was the first occasion that the BBC had been permitted to televise a boxing match but also the first time a transmission had been shown live to a paying audience in cinemas (the Marble Arch Pavilion and the Tatler News Theatre). This was achieved on Baird projection equipment using a 16-inch projection tube running at 45,000 volts, producing light levels comparable to that of normal films. Each projection unit contained two projection tubes, one acting as a backup in case the first one failed. This preceded the first televised heavyweight boxing match (Max Baer vs Lou Nova, from Yankee Stadium) which was held on 1 June 1939.\nBoon married Wendy Elliot in 1940 and, following his retirement from the sport, played a number of small roles in British films such as Champagne Charlie and Carry On Sergeant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chatteris", "response": ["* Eric Boon, boxer; British Lightweight Champion 1938\u20131944.Eric Boon statistics , BoxRec.com, URL accessed 19 July 2010"]}, {"page": "Champagne Charlie (1944 film)", "response": ["* Eric Boon as Clinker"]}, {"page": "Jack Kid Berg", "response": ["After the Canzoneri bout, Berg continued boxing with mixed results. He became British lightweight champion in 1934 by beating the title holder Harry Mizler, another Jewish boxer.   He was thrust back into the limelight as a replacement for the injured Canzoneri against Cleto Locatelli at Madison Square Garden, but his hopes of challenging for the world title faded after a points defeat to Gustave Humery in Paris in February 1935, also losing a return bout in London in April, although Berg was still British champion at this point. Later that year he lost to Laurie Stevens in a fight for the British Empire lightweight title in Johannesburg. He returned to fighting at welterweight in the United States with some success. In August 1936, after three straight defeats, he announced his retirement, but returned in January 1937 with a victory against Ivor Pickens, the first of a nine fight unbeaten run. In January 1941 he moved up to middleweight to fight Harry Craster. He again beat Mizler in February 1941 and defeated British lightweight champion Eric Boon on a disqualification due to a low blow in a non-title fight in April 1941. After a victory over Eric Dolby in March 1945, Berg expressed a desire to once more challenge for a title, saying \"What I need is fights. I'm a bad gymnasium worker, but I'll show what I can do in the ring. When I've had a few warm up fights I'll know where I stand. If I'm no good I'll quit.\" He had two further fights, the last a win by knockout against Johnny MacDonald in May 1945, before retiring.", "In October 1940 he was awarded \u00a3500 damages for slander after John Macadam suggested in a BBC broadcast that Berg would fight Eric Boon after \"drawing his old-age pension\" and \"tottering along to Earl's Court\", although the decision was overturned on appeal.", "|align=left| Eric Boon"]}, {"page": "Lonsdale Belt", "response": ["The NSC became virtually defunct in 1929 and lost control of the sport to the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), which started to issue the Lord Lonsdale Challenge Belt in 1936.
