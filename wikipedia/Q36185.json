Jackie's introduction was part of a high-profile storyline that saw Deirdre framed by her boyfriend and wrongfully imprisoned. Jackie first appeared in a specially constructed prison cell at Granada Studios. Deirdre's conviction was quashed within three weeks and she was released; Jackie soon followed her to the soap's primary setting of Weatherfield on parole, needing a friend to turn to, having been dumped by her partner and left homeless. Jackie moved to the area with her teenage son Tyrone (Alan Halsall), squatting in Curly Watts' (Kevin Kennedy) vacant premises. She became a factory worker for Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), where she had numerous run-ins with Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) over flirtations with Janice's husband Les Battersby (Bruce Jones). Jackie remained on the show for one year before leaving in the midst of a property feud with Curly, who had returned to Coronation Street to find her formally renting his house. Jackie fled back to Liverpool with her husband Darren (James McMartin), though Tyrone stayed behind as a lodger with Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn)."]}, {"page": "List of longest-serving soap opera actors", "response": ["|Bill Tarmey || Jack Duckworth || Coronation Street || 1979, 1981, 1982\u20132010 ||  years || "]}, {"page": "Molly Dobbs", "response": ["After briefly working in her father's shop and at Kirk's kennels, Molly then starts working for Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) at his corner shop.
