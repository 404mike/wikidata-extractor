In 1992 he came seventh in the Men's Four along with teammates Mark Tout, George Farrell and Lenox Paul.  In 1994 he came joint tenth. He is also well known as the 1994 UK Gladiators men's champion, as well as the runner-up in the first International Gladiators competition behind America's Wesley Two Scoops Berry, albeit in controversial circumstances following a severe albeit unintentional tackle by American gladiator Hawk, during the Powerball event in the Grand Final. Because of his successful achievements and all-round good sportsmanship, he is still highly regarded amongst fans of the series, and is known as one of the greatest contenders in the history of Gladiators as a global franchise, especially during its mid '90s heyday.\nPaul Field grew up in Hemel Hempstead where he competed for Dacorum Athletics Club. In the 1980s he was the third ranked British decathlete behind Daley Thompson. Paul still lives in Hemel Hempstead with his wife and 3 children.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 1992 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|Mark ToutGeorge FarrellPaul FieldLenny Paul"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1994 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|Sean OlssonPaul Field", "|Sean OlssonJohn HerbertDean WardPaul Field"]}, {"page": "South Oxhey", "response": ["*Paul Field - Two time Winter Olympian from South Oxhey but was raised up in Hemel Hempstead."]}, {"page": "International Gladiators 1", "response": ["|Phil Norman (UK series 2 winner)Paul Field (UK series 3 winner)"]}, {"page": "Paul Field", "response": ["Paul Field may refer to:", "*Paul Field (bobsledder) (born 1967), bobsledder from Great Britain", "*Paul Field (musician) (born 1961), Australian singer-songwriter and musician", "*Paul Field (rugby league), Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s", "*Paul Field (Christian singer), musician from Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Bobsleigh at the 1994 Winter Olympics \u2013 Four-man", "response": ["| 8 || 15 || align=\"left\"|  || align=\"left\"|  Sean Olsson  John Herbert  Dean Ward  Paul Field  || 52.23 || 52.45 || 52.26 || 52.47 || 3:29.41 || +1.63"]}, {"page": "Bobsleigh at the 1994 Winter Olympics \u2013 Two-man", "response": ["| 10 || 17 || align=\"left\"|  || align=\"left\"| Sean Olsson  Paul Field || 52.86 || 53.30 || 53.21 || 53.46 || 3:32.83 || +2.02"]}, {"page": "Gladiators (1992 British TV series)", "response": ["|bgcolor=8DB4E3|Paul Field"]}, {"page": "Paul Field (bobsleigh)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Field (bobsledder)"]}, {"page": "Bobsleigh at the 1992 Winter Olympics \u2013 Four-man", "response": ["| 7 ||align=left|  || align=left|  Mark Tout  George Farrell  Paul Field  Lenny Paul || 58.49 || 58.87 || 58.73 || 58.80 || 3:54.89"]}]}}
