It has been described as an imaginative tour de force.  Manuscripts of the poem mostly attribute it to Dafydd ap Gwilym, widely seen as the greatest of the Welsh poets, though some name Dafydd ab Edmwnd or Ieuan ap Rhys ap Llywelyn as the author.  Modern literary historians have differed as to whether it is indeed by Dafydd ap Gwilym, but the two most recent editions of his poems (by Thomas Parry and Dafydd Johnston respectively) have rejected it.  The poem has nevertheless remained popular with translators and it continues to appear in anthologies, including Thomas Parry's own Oxford Book of Welsh Verse and Gwyn Jones's Oxford Book of Welsh Verse in English.", "A large majority of the surviving manuscripts of this poem, including Cardiff MS 4.330 and Peniarth MS 49, mentioned above, attribute it to Dafydd ap Gwilym.  However, two of them, including the very earliest, BL Add.

Its style, he summed up, was exactly that of the 15th century, and he favoured the claims of Ieuan ap Rhys, though when he included it in his Oxford Book of Welsh Verse (1962) he labelled it as an anonymous 15th century poem.  Parry's rejection of the poem from the Dafydd ap Gwilym canon proved very controversial and provoked many protests from other scholars, notably in two papers by D. J. Bowen.  Nevertheless, the most recent edition of his poems, by Dafydd Johnston and others, again excluded \"The Snow\"."]}]}}
