Len Langford had made over 100 appearances and had appeared in the 1933 FA Cup Final, which City lost 3\u20130 to Everton. He missed the final game of the 1932\u201333 season and the opening match of 1933\u201334, but went on to play 18 consecutive League games before injury on 16 December 1933 ended his time as City's first choice. Langford's replacement for the following game was James Nicholls, but he endured a torrid time as Manchester City lost 8\u20130 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Consequently, Swift was given an opportunity for the Christmas double-header against Derby County. He conceded four goals in his debut at the Baseball Ground on 25 December, but in the return match the next day, his 20th birthday, he kept a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 win. After making his debut, Swift played in every first team match for more than four seasons, a run of more than 200 consecutive matches. His only absence prior to the suspension of football due to World War II was a single match in September 1938, where without Swift, Manchester City lost 6\u20131 at home to Millwall.James, Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record, p. 354."]}, {"page": "George Heppell", "response": ["Heppell joined Port Vale from Wolverhampton Wanderers in May 1937. He made 25 Third Division North appearances in the 1937\u201338 season, as goalkeeping duties were split between himself and James Nicholls. However, he played just three Third Division South games in the 1938\u201339 season, as new signing Arthur Jepson became the club's first choice goalkeeper. Heppell was enlisted into the Army in February 1940. Despite this he managed to guest for Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough during World War II, before returning to Port Vale following his demobilization in January 1946. He was an ever-present during the 1946\u201347 season, as his form convinced the club to sell Jepson to rivals Stoke City. He remained Gordon Hodgson's first choice goalkeeper, playing 40 games in the 1947\u201348 campaign. He played 38 games in the 1948\u201349 season, ahead of reserves Ray Hancock and Harry Prince. However, he then lost his place, and played just three games in the 1949\u201350 season as new signing Ray King proved to be in impressive form. He featured 17 and 28 times in the 1950\u201351 and 1951\u201352 seasons, before being handed a free transfer away from Vale Park by new boss Freddie Steele in May 1952.
