As usual he adapts historical facts freely in the construction of his fiction, though he generally follows Comines' balanced approach to the character of Louis XI. He was able to make substantial use of other documents and the editorial commentary in the collection in which Comines was included, the first series of the Collection complete des m\u00e9moires relatifs a l'histoire de France by [Claude Bernard] Petitot (1819\u201226). Occasional details are drawn from a wide range of historians, most of whom were more hostile to Louis. It is likely that some details for Scott's descriptions of northern France were derived from manuscript material deriving from continental journeys by his friend James Skene of Rubislaw. For his gipsy material Scott relied largely on two works: 'Dissertation on the Gipseys ... from the German of H. M. G. Grellmann (1807), and A Historical Survey of the Customs, Habits, and Present State of the Gypsies by John Hoyland (1816).Ibid., 497\u2013504."]}, {"page": "John Hoyland (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Hoyland was a British artist.", "John Hoyland may also refer to:", "*John Hoyland (organist) (1783\u20131827), English organist and composer ", "*John Hoyland (writer) (1750\u20131831), English Quaker author, known as a writer on the Romani people "]}]}}
