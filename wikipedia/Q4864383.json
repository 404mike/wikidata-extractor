They are carved into the cliffs surrounding the area of Akhetaten, or the Horizon of Aten, which demarcates the limits of the site. The Pharaoh Akhenaten commissioned the construction of Akhetaten in year five of his reign during the New Kingdom. It served as a sacred space for the god Aten in an uninhabited location roughly halfway between Memphis and Thebes at today's Tell El-Amarna. The boundary stelae include the foundation decree of Akhetaten along with later additions to the text, which delineate the boundaries and describe the purpose of the site and its founding by the Pharaoh. Total of sixteen stelae have been discovered around the area. According to Barry Kemp, the Pharaoh Akhenaten did not \u201cconceive of Akhetaten as a city, but as a tract of sacred land\u201d.", "Due to the fragmented part of the Earlier Proclamation making a mention of some unsavory things the pharaoh had heard at Thebes, a theory that posits a clash with the priesthood of Amun of Thebes has been put forward by scholars.

It lies south of the city and east of the modern village of el-Hagg Quandil. For a long time its ruins were thought to be those of a Roman military camp, but between 1988 and 2000 Barry Kemp excavated remains of an Amarna period stone temple with garden and subsidiary buildings including a bakery and a brewery. Neither the original name nor the owner of the complex has been identified.Nicholas Reeves: Akhenaten \u2013 Egypt's False Prophet.

It consists of a brick enclosure with an area of 228\u00d7213 m; it is divided into two unequal parts by an east-west wall. It is likely that pylon gates opened on all four outer walls. Since it stood at a very prominent place \u2013 at the southern end of the so-called Royal Road, the main street of Akhet-Aten \u2013 it's possibly identical with the sunshade temple of Nefertiti mentioned on the boundary stelae.The Amarna Project: Kom el-Nana"]}, {"page": "Amarna Tomb 3", "response": ["Fifty-nine instances of Greek graffiti have been scratched into the lower plaster of the tomb\u2019s corridors. The graffiti was discovered in 1835 by Sir John Gardiner Wilkinson. Barry Kemp, the Director of Excavations at Amarna, has stated that this graffiti can be dated to the Ptolemaic Period. The graffiti records the messages and names of the tomb's visitors, most of which are presumed to have been soldiers. A graffito in the corridor records a message from a Greek visitor; \u201cI come. Year 37\u201d. The most well-known Greek graffito from the tomb is located next to the exterior door frame of the tomb. The inscription reads: \u201chaving ascended here, Catullinus has engraved this in the doorway, marvelling at the art of the holy quarriers\u201d. This graffito provides insight into later Greek perspectives on the art, technology and architecture of the Ancient Egyptians. Another message is a Coptic Christian graffito, providing evidence for the coptic occupation of the site. Coptic Christians coopted the site of the North Tombs in the fifth and sixth centuries AD. They inhabited the tomb of Ahmose, as evidenced by two low exterior walls which were built by later settlers.

The archaeologist Barry Kemp identifies the temple as an annex of Menkaure's valley temple, and the vestibule as a second gatehouse. Inside a storage room, Hassan uncovered a fragment of an alabaster offering table which bore the partial inscription \"... her father, king's daughter\", and hieroglyphs which Hassan interpreted as being the triple Ka hieroglyph of Khentkaus' name. The Egyptologist Mark Lehner concedes that this is a very plausible reading, but not entirely certain, and does not prove that the temple itself was built for Khentkaus. During excavations between 2005 and 2009, Hassan's \"wide, brick-paved causeway\" was revealed to be an ascending ramp. The ramp does not appear to interface with Khentkaus' causeway, which itself traverses east-west and has no identifiable deviation to the south. The most direct identifiable path from her pyramid town to this ramp would be via an exit in the south-east corner of her town, an area which has not yet been cleared."]}]}}
