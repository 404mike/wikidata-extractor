His works have been reviewed by Publishers Weekly, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. He is known for his \"convincing\" depictions of World War II and Berlin. He has written a series of espionage thrillers, based around Anglo-American character John Russell exploring Germany in the 1940s. They are known as \"The Station Series\" because they are all named after train stations, mostly in Berlin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spy fiction", "response": ["The events leading up to the Second World War, and the War itself, continue to be fertile ground for authors of spy fiction.

The guy is a spectacular guitarist, those melodies are so marvelous, so calculated, constructed note to note\u2026 he must have killed to get those notes. It puts my hairs on end!\u201d.  David Downing suggests that this may be an overstatement but that the performance is nonetheless \"remarkable.\"  Downing praises the intensity produced by the \"straining and stretching notes\" that Young plays \"almost in slow motion.\"  Downing especially notes the accompaniment to the final line about flying with stone wings, where Downing feels that the guitar playing allows the listener to feel how heavy those stone wings are but still makes the listener believe that the bird will find a way to fly with them anyway.

Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald describes Ben Keith's playing on pedal steel to be a highlight of the song. Young biographer David Downing describes his pedal steel playing as having a \"blue-sky purity.\" According to Greenwald, the music has a \"searching, yearning melody that has the element of infinity and journey\" that perfectly reflects the theme of the lyrics. Sound on Sound editor Sam Inglis describes the mood of the song as being \"one of resignation, perhaps even exhaustion.\""]}, {"page": "List of alternate history fiction", "response": ["| David Downing"]}, {"page": "Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me", "response": ["Paramount Pictures began filming a cinematic adaptation of Fari\u00f1a's novel on May 25, 1970, with principal photography finished by late July.

Between October 1972 and December 1975, 35 issues of the magazine were published in London, by Hanover Books, sometime in Berners Street W1. The publisher was Peter Shepherd, who also published other music publications including Folk Review and Country Music. Dave Laing was the founding editor; John Pidgeon took over as editor in October 1973. The reviews editor was Simon Frith, and Charlie Gillett was consultant editor. Other contributors included John Peel, Lester Bangs, Michael Gray, Mick Gold, Mick Houghton, David Downing, Gary Herman, Idris Walters, Karl Dallas and Phil Hardy, and the soul music column was written by Pete Wingfield. The initial art editor was John Finn. Designers and illustrators included Barney Bubbles, George Snow, Kevin Sparrow and Peter Till. The magazine struggled to achieve consistent sales of 20,000 and closed due to market forces. Music writers David Hepworth and Barney Hoskyns have called Let It Rock influential, and suggested that it was the precursor of such music publications as Q magazine and Mojo."]}, {"page": "Zoo station", "response": ["*Zoo Station, a 2007 novel by David Downing named after the Berlin railway station"]}, {"page": "Flowers Forever", "response": ["* David Downing \u2013 cello"]}, {"page": "Will to Love", "response": ["The singer of \"Will to Love\" imagines himself to be a salmon swimming upstream to mate and struggling to survive.

Music critic Johnny Rogan describes the lyrics as presenting rhetorical questions about a relationship with a woman.  To Rogan, the singer wonders how much love he will receive from the relationship and the extent to which we will be able to accept \u2013 or harvest \u2013 that love.  Music journalist Nigel Williamson regards the lyrics as reflecting Young's \"inability to accept happiness at face value.\"  Williamson sees the refrain of \"Dream up, dream up/Let me fill your cup\" as another reference to the \"harvest\" in the title.  Another interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect the passage of time.  Yet another interpretation is that the lyrics are about \"maturing out of adolescence.\"  Young biographer Jimmy McDonough interprets lyrics such as \"Did she wake you up to tell you that/It was only a change of plan\" as referring to his then mother-in-law's previous suicide attempts.  Inglis also interprets the line \"Did I see you down in a young girl's town/With your mother in so much pain\" as referring to this situation.

Bielen compares lines in the opening verse that the narrator is a musician with a later line that \"The same thing that makes you live/Can kill you in the end\" as implying that \"the rock-and-roll lifestyle can take a toll on a marriage.\"  And indeed Young's marriage to Pegi came to an end 22 years later.  Young biographer David Downing interprets the reference to divorce a little differently.  He interprets that the fact that the possibility of divorce is mentioned once but then not again as suggesting that divorce is just part of marriage the way death is part of life.  Downing interprets the song as being an \"ambitious attempt at understanding the process by which people carry their pasts into their presents.\""]}, {"page": "Unknown Legend", "response": ["Young biographer David Downing sees the song as one of several on Harvest Moon that describe Americans feeling a deep sense of loss for unknown reasons in 1992."]}, {"page": "Crime in the City (Sixty to Zero Part I)", "response": ["\"Crime in the City\" was written on a sailboat in 1988 on the same day Young wrote \"Ordinary People\" and \"Days That Used to Be.\"  It is a lengthy song whose released version has five verses and is almost nine minutes long.  Earlier versions of the song, entitled \"Sixty to Zero,\" which Young performed in concert with the Bluenotes in 1988 were even longer, going on as long as 11 verses and 20 minutes.  Young would play both acoustic and electric versions of the earlier version, though the final released version was heavily acoustic.  According to David Downing the lyrics describe \"selfishness, stupidity and senseless violence.\"  Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald interprets it as \"illustrating society's lost and found in the late-Reagan administration America of the late '80s.\"  Rolling Stone Magazine contributor Andy Greene describes it as \"a frantic screed about people slowly losing their minds in a wild city.\"  The editors of Rolling Stone described it as a companion to the bookend song on Freedom, \"Rockin' in the Free World,\" stating that it \"surveys Eighties moral rot.\"  Music journalist Paul Williams interpreted \"Crime in the City\" to be a \"demand that we stop ignoring and denying the reality all around us,\" also noting that it shares this theme with \"Rockin' in the Free World.\""]}, {"page": "Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (song)", "response": ["The music of \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" has a country rock flavor.

Bielen compares the feel of the production to that of the Buffalo Springfield songs \"Expecting to Fly\" and \"Broken Arrow.\"   The recording was mostly live with the main exception being the backing vocals which were overlaid later.  According to Young biographer David Downing, while recording the song Young told CSN&Y bassist Greg Reeves that \"what we've got to do is listen with an eye to simplicity.
