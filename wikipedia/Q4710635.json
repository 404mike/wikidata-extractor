He is best known in Scottish football for scoring two goals for Dundee against Hearts on the final day of the 1985\u201386 season to deny Hearts the championship.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Heart of Midlothian F.C.", "response": ["Hearts needed a draw from the last game of the season away to Dundee on 3 May 1986 to win the Scottish league title. Before that final game they were two points ahead of Celtic and with a superior goal difference of four goals. However, this strong statistical position was undermined in the run up to the game when several players in the Hearts squad were hit by a viral infection. Craig Levein failed to recover to make the game in Dundee. Celtic were 4\u20130 up away at St Mirren at half time in their final fixture. Thus, at half time the players knew that they would have to deliver a result at Dens Park. Substitute Albert Kidd forced Hearts to concede a corner kick with seven minutes remaining. The in-swinging corner was touched on and fell to Kidd who put Dundee ahead. This was the first goal Hearts had conceded from a corner all season. Hearts now needed an equaliser to win the title. However, Kidd went on a run with the ball from the halfway line down the right wing beating two Hearts players. After then playing a one-two with a teammate on the edge of the Hearts box he finished to score a second with four minutes left. Dundee won 2\u20130. This combined with Celtic winning 5\u20130 against St Mirren meant the top two clubs finished the season on the same number of points. Hearts lost out to Celtic by a goal difference of three. Had goal difference been the rule in 1965 Hearts would have been champions; had goal average still applied in 1986, they would have won the league. Hearts lobbying after the league loss in 1965 cost them the title in 1986."]}, {"page": "John Robertson (footballer, born 1964)", "response": ["Hibernian attempted to sign Robertson as a teenager but he asked for time to think the deal over; after Hibs refused, he signed for Heart of Midlothian along with school friend and fellow future internationalist Dave Bowman. Robertson eventually earned the moniker \"The Hammer of Hibs\" (in addition to his more standard nickname \"Robbo\") as he scored a record 27 goals in Edinburgh derby matches. In 1986, 20 league goals from Robertson helped Hearts to the brink of a league and cup double. A 27 league game unbeaten run ended with two Albert Kidd goals for Dundee in the last six minutes of the season allowing Celtic to overtake them to win the title. A week later, Hearts lost 3\u20130 to Aberdeen in the cup final.

Levein won the SPFA Young Player of the Year award in 1985 and 1986, becoming the first player to retain the title. In the latter season Hearts chased a league and cup double. Two goals in the last 10 minutes of the season by Albert Kidd gave Hearts their first league defeat in 31 games, which handed the league title to Celtic. Levein missed that game through illness.

Celtic raced into a 4\u20130 lead by half-time, whilst the game at Dens Park remained goal-less.  Celtic scored a fifth early in the second half.  In 83 minutes Albert Kidd scored for Dundee against Hearts.  Celtic fans celebrated wildly at Love Street, but an equaliser from Hearts could still have seen the title go to Tynecastle.  Five minutes later however, Kidd added a second for Dundee, seeing Hearts lose their match 2\u20130, with Celtic's 5\u20130 win sealing the league championship title via goal difference."]}, {"page": "Kidd (surname)", "response": ["* Albert Kidd (born 1961), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "David Hay", "response": ["Hay succeeded Billy McNeill as Celtic manager in 1983, winning the Scottish Cup in 1985 and the Premier Division in dramatic fashion in 1986.
