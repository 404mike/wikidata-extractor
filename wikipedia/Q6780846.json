It was designed by Mrs Mary Townley in 1780.  Whilst still a princess, Queen Victoria spent holidays in Ramsgate and stayed at Townley House, which is now part of Farleys Furniture Store.", "At this point Mary Townley purchased the property.  Her husband, James, was one of the original purchasers of some of the plots in Albion Place. James Townley had gone on to purchase the green in front of Albion Place in 1803. This was sold in 1839 at the time of Mary Townley's death. Mary Townley, n\u00e9e Gostling, was one of England's earliest female architects. She came from a well-established family in Twickenham. ", "Mary Townley owned Albion House until her death in 1839.  At this point the property was put up for sale at auction along with a number of other properties owned by the Townley family. The house continued to be let as a holiday home to members of the gentry.  In 1838 the Duke of Newcastle stayed there for the season.   He returned again in 1846.", "Mary Townley's death coincided with Ramsgate becoming a less fashionable resort to stay in for the aristocracy and gentry.  \"The smarter resorts on the south coast began to lose their aristocratic tone in the 1840s and 1850s, when they were discovered by middle-class Londoners. Towards the end of the century Charles Booth found a growing number of Londoners, especially clerks, policemen, shopworkers and local government employees, who had a week's or even a fortnight's paid holiday, and were thus able to join in London's colonization of the Kent coast\". The house may then have struggled to have been let as a family residence and for this reason became used as a gentleman's club before becoming a lodging house.  Albion House was certainly a lodging house by at least 1857 when George Potter, a substantial farmer, was at the property.  He is recorded at the property in the 1861 census as a Lodging House Keeper. By the mid-nineteenth century it was being used by the middle classes for holidays with people like the Church family, headed by Edmund Boyle Church, a solicitor visiting.", "November 2014 reopened as a boutique hotel.
