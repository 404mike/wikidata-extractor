After the war he took a degree in English from Queen Mary College, London, which was followed by postgraduate work on Anglo-Saxon at King's College, Cambridge, gaining a PhD in 1956. He then held a research fellowship at the University of Reading until 1961 when he returned to Cambridge under Dorothy Whitelock, whom he replaced as Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon in the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in 1969.\nHis son Martin is the founder of Eye2eye Software Ltd, based in Cambridge, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cynric", "response": ["*Peter Clemoes, Simon Keynes, Michael Lapidge (1981).

Indeed, the poem is seen as celebrating a logical progression in the development of England as a unified nation ruled by the House of Wessex; the battle reports \"the dawning of a sense of nationality, ....a crisis in which a nation is involved\".Ashdown 120. In this respect, Brunanburh is closer to the Anglo-Saxon poem The Taking of the Five Boroughs, also found in the Chronicle under the year 942, celebrating King Edmund's recapture of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. But while the poet claims veracity, Michael Swanton notes, \"it is ironic in view of his primarily historic concerns that he is in fact more successful than the Maldon-poet in transmitting the traditional poetic style.\"Swanton 167. Peter Clemoes argues in Interactions of Thought and Language in Old English Poetry that Brunanburh, as opposed to Maldon, relies on \"uncomplicated patriotic triumphalism\". The poem does not treat \"personal responsibility\" as Maldon does,Clemoes 411. but leans on an expansive view of history which sees the battle, in line with the Chronicles view of contemporary history as the \"epitome of Anglo-Saxon, especially West Saxon, history with antecedents in the history of Britain\", as \"straightforwardly traditional\".Clemoes 420.

The Old English poem, surviving on a single manuscript from the turn of the millennium, attracted considerable interest after its first modern publication in 1815, and spawned what was termed in A Beowulf Handbook as a \"bewildering debate about perhaps the most vexing problems in Beowulf scholarship: when was the poem composed, where, by whom, for whom?\" Chase's introduction, \"Opinions on the Date of Beowulf, 1815\u20131980\"\u2014which one reviewer termed \"an essay commendable both for its balance and its economy\"\u2014traced a century and a half of academic discourse over the first of these questions, which, having stared with a first tentative date of the poem of shortly after the fourth century, had by 1980 consistently settled on a date in the latter half of the eighth century. Each chapter used a different approach, such as historical, metrical, stylistic, and codicological, to try to date the poem. Chase's own attempt at dating looked at the poem's balanced attitude towards heroic culture, reflecting both appreciation and admonition, to suggest that \"Beowulf was written at a time when heroic culture could be treated fully and positively but without romanticizing, by an author neither afraid nor infatuated.\" Given the paucity of material with which to trace the evolution of historical perspectives, Chase turned to the better-known lives of the saints from the time period. Seeing early lives which appeared \"to avoid and even suppress significant exploitation\" of heroic culture and values, and later lives which moved \"towards a celebration of heroic values in a way that has been fully integrated with Anglo-Saxon culture\", Chase suggested that \"Beowulf is likely to have been written neither early, in the eighth century, nor late, in the tenth, but in the rapidly changing and chaotic ninth\". Other chapters, meanwhile, by scholars such as Peter Clemoes and Kevin Kiernan, suggested a date for the poem as early as the eighth century, and as late as the eleventh. In the book's wake came what was described in A Beowulf Handbook as \"a cautious and necessary incertitude\". An anonymous reviewer of the book termed it \"one of the most important inconclusions in the study of Old English\", and declared that \"henceforth every discussion of the poem and its period will begin with reference to this volume.\""]}, {"page": "Rowland L.
