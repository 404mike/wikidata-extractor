On Sunday Wellington published a blog post in which she referred to Sun Tzu's book The Art of War and elaborated on how war strategy could be applied to triathlon, saying that she hadn't lost her fight because of her injuries and quoting Bella Bayliss's dictum that \"It's not a race, it's war.\" The flight had caused her leg to swell up again, but she was still able to do some bike and run training. On Monday she tried a four-kilometre swim, her first hard swim since the crash; this produced pain in her pectoral muscle, which worsened over subsequent training sessions. On Tuesday she tried another swim session: after 1\u00a0km she had to stop, and again had to be lifted out of the pool by Lowe. She later wote, \"I was 'crying into my goggles', and described the pain as 'unbearable'\", adding, \"I was convinced I'd broken my rib. Every breath hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly.\" The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy (ART); he instructed her to go to the hospital for tests, not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture. The hospital's first concern, from the swollen state of her leg, was that she might have a pulmonary embolism. Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures, nor any embolism, but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles; the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed."]}, {"page": "Bella Comerford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bella Bayliss"]}, {"page": "Embrunman", "response": ["The men's record time for the event is 9 h 28m 18 s by the Frenchman L\u00e9on Chevalier on August 15, 2021 and the women's record is held by Carrie Lester from Australia at 10 h 46 m 26 s.
