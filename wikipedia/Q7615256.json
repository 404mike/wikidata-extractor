Selwood played initially for Middlesex and joined Derbyshire in the 2001 season. He was a left-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler.\nHis highest score at County level was 99.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dominic Cork", "response": ["In 2002, Cork played more regularly for Derbyshire, but pressure began to build on his captaincy with Derbyshire performing poorly in List A cricket and ending the season 6th in the County Championship, although he did take 64 wickets at 18.90.  Cork's international career came to an end in 2002, allowing him to dedicate himself to playing season long for Derbyshire.  With the internal problems at the county, Cork's form with both bat and ball was erratic: his first-class bowling average in 2001 was 51.50, 18.90 in 2002, and 27.26 in 2003. His performances in one-day cricket remained more consistent.  The 2003 season was also one of Cork's most controversial.  Following a Twenty20 fixture against Leicestershire in the Twenty20 Cup, Cork branded Australian Brad Hodge a cheat after he appeared to catch Steven Selwood after crossing the boundary rope. He also branded the response of the England and Wales Cricket Board's chief executive, Tim Lamb, as \"pathetic\". Following the remarks, Hodge considered legal action. The England and Wales Cricket Board took action, summoning Cork to a hearing where they fined him \u00a31,000 and banned him for three matches.  The three match ban was suspended for a year. With Derbyshire rooted to the bottom of the County Championship Division Two table at the end of the season and coupled with the internal issues at Derbyshire, including incoming Director of Cricket David Houghton's refusal to confirm him as captain for 2004, Cork requested to be released from the remainder of his three-year contract extension agreed only at the beginning of the 2003 season.  His release was granted by the county."]}, {"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Steven Selwood "]}, {"page": "Selwood", "response": ["*Steven Selwood, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Selwood, Steven", "response": ["#redirectSteven Selwood"]}]}}
