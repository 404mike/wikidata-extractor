Davis, blessed with a wonderful left foot, startling on-pitch vision and unerring pass accuracy, was renowned for his calmness within the heat of a midfield battle. Elegant yet not unwilling to use force when needed, he was the perfect multi-purpose midfielder. In George Graham's first season in charge 1986\u201387, Davis had a great campaign. He formed a brilliant midfield partnership with Steve Williams, which was key to Arsenal beating Liverpool in the League Cup Final 2\u20131.
