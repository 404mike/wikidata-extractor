In April 1986, Quinn was found guilty of drink-driving and received a \u00a3100 fine, as well as a one-year driving ban for a similar offence committed in Liverpool during 1985.

The BBC got their fairytale ending \u2013 United gaining promotion on a glorious day at Leicester, winning 5\u20132 with goals from Paul Wood, Brian Deane, Wilf Rostron, and 2 from Tony Agana. This season also saw the rise of the chant \"Ooh Ah Bob Booker\" in adulation of 32-year-old Bob Booker, signed by Bassett from Brentford in 1989 but soon a hero to fans of the club. This would later be borrowed for Eric Cantona, but Booker maintains in the book \"Match of My Life \u2013 Sheffield United\" by Nick Johnson, that the chant was originally started by fans of the club.
