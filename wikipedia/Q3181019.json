That was during a BBC Scotland radio conversation hosted by John Beattie. Cosgrove commented, \"Yesterday, I was watching the rolling BBC News very closely and it was clear that notions of balance were being predicated on a party political basis. It would go from Cameron to Miliband to Clegg and back. If you look at it as a different premise \u2013 it's a yes/no question \u2013 then Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens, who is not the leader but is a significant political person within the Yes campaign, should have had exactly the same coverage as Ed Miliband. Do you think for a second he got that? Of course he didn't. I think there's been a failure of the understanding of the nature of balance and due impartiality. It's simply wrong and not acceptable\"."]}, {"page": "Heriot's Rugby Club", "response": ["* John Beattie (25 Caps for Scotland, 1980, 1983, 1986 British and Irish Lions)"]}, {"page": "Sportscene", "response": ["Sportscene's main anchors are David Currie and Jonathan Sutherland.
