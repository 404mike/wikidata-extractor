Banks had previously written, in 1988, Cybermen, a fictional history of the Cybermen which included a \"future\" design for them. The Missing Adventure Novel Killing Ground also features Cybermen of the type seen in Revenge of the Cybermen. During this novel, the Sixth Doctor's new companion Grant Markham returns to his home planet and learns that a group of Cybermen have hidden on it for centuries, with his robophobia being based around the repressed memory of witnessing a Cyberman kill his mother before he escaped.", "The audio play Real Time implies that the converted victim's face remains beneath the Cyberman faceplate, although the audio plays, like all non-televised spin-off media, are of uncertain canonicity with regard to the television series. In the 2014's \"Death in Heaven\", Danny Pink removes the faceplate showing his face underneath. The Virgin New Adventures novel Iceberg by David Banks states that some Cybermen experience rare flashes of emotional memory from the time before they were converted; these flashes are then usually suppressed. The Cybermen in the revived series are usually constructed from human brains bonded to a Cyberman exoskeletal shell with an artificially-grown nervous system threaded throughout (\"The Age of Steel\"), although direct grafting of cyber-components is another method of conversion (\"Cyberwoman\"). In \"The Pandorica Opens\", a Cyberman head is shown to open up, revealing an entire human skull, not just the brain."]}, {"page": "Brookside (TV series)", "response": ["The introduction of Brookside Parade saw Ron Dixon open a convenience store called Dixon's Trading Post, Barry Grant opened a bar/nightclub initially called La Luz, and Terry Sullivan opened Pizza Parade, where Matty Nolan (Tony Scoggo) and Owen Daniels worked for a while.
