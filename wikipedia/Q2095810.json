Fenton was the first official war photographer and his work included documenting the effects of the war on the troops, panoramas of the landscapes where the battles took place, model representations of the action, and portraits of commanders, which laid the groundwork for modern photojournalism.  Other photographers of the war included William Simpson and Carol Szathmari. Similarly, the American Civil War photographs of Mathew Brady were engraved before publication in Harper's Weekly. The technology had not yet developed to the point of being able to print photographs in newspapers, which greatly restricted the audience of Brady's photographs. However, it was still common for photographs to be engraved and subsequently printed in newspapers or periodicals throughout the war. Disaster, including train wrecks and city fires, was also a popular subject for illustrated newspapers in the early days."]}, {"page": "Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury", "response": ["In 2020, Lord Salisbury published a book entitled William Simpson and the Crisis in Central Asia, 1884-5.

He identified the small valley, shown on a later map as \"The Valley of the Shadow of Death\", as the place where Fenton had taken his photograph (see right). Two pictures were taken of this area, one with several cannonballs on the road, the other with an empty road. Hitherto opinions differed concerning which one was taken first but Morris spotted evidence that the photo without the cannonballs was taken first. He remains uncertain about why balls were moved onto the road in the second picture\u2014perhaps, he notes, Fenton probably deliberately placed them there to enhance the image. The alternative is that soldiers were gathering up cannonballs for reuse and they threw down balls higher up the hill onto the road and ditch for collection later. Other art historians, such as Nigel Spivey of Cambridge University, identify the images as from the nearby Woronzoff Road. In June 1855 illustrator and war correspondent William Simpson produced a watercolour of the Woronzoff Road, but looking downhill, which has cannonballs similarly placed to those shown by Fenton; Simpson's publisher too used the title \"The Valley of the Shadow of Death\". This is the location accepted by the local tour guides."]}, {"page": "War artist", "response": ["* William Simpson was an artist-correspondent who sent artwork to London from the front during the Crimean War.Harrington, Peter.  \"The First True War Artist,\" MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History, Vol. 9, No. 1, Autumn 1996, pp.\u00a0100\u2013109.
