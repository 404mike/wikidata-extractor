It took a further four years for them to achieve promotion, gaining a place in the League of Wales as runners-up to Ton Pentre who had spurned their right as champions in season 1999\u20132000. Following their return to the League of Wales the club had a see-saw existence. In 2003, the club lost its league status, but a successful campaign back in the Welsh League brought a prompt return of Premiership football to Steboneath Park. Disagreements over the playing budget led to the resignation of promotion-winning manager, Neil O'Brien and chairman Robert Jones turned to former Cardiff boss Eddie May. But a disastrous nine-match losing start to the campaign saw Nick Tucker arrive from Taffs Well to take over in mid-October 2004. The Reds gained their first win of the season at the 11th attempt and by the end of the season had hauled themselves into 14th position, a remarkable recovery. Summer 2005 saw the first full-time footballer at Stebonheath since the Jock Stein era of the 1950s, with eight professionals under Spanish director of football, Lucas Cazorla Luque. Although the Spaniard parted company midway through the season, the Reds went on to finish runners-up and clinch a first-ever place in Europe under manager Peter Nicholas. They became one of the few Welsh clubs to progress past the first round in Europe, beating Swedish outfit Gefle IF, going out bravely in the next round to Danish giants, Odense BK 6\u20131 on aggregate. Their European exertions affected their league campaign, but despite a mid-season slump, they rallied in the closing stages to clinch third place and an InterToto Cup spot. The Reds then enjoyed a superb season in 2007/8, clinching their first-ever Welsh Premier title with three games to go and a first appearance in the UEFA Champions League, where they lost to Latvian champions FK Ventspils 4\u20131 on aggregate, after winning the home leg 1\u20130. Failure to repeat the feat in the following campaign resulted in the dismissal of manager Nicholas after four years at the helm, he was replaced by veteran defender Andy Legg. Legg's first game in charge was the 1\u20130 victory over Scottish Premier League side, Motherwell. The Reds lost the return leg 3\u20130. Legg guided Llanelli to their first ever Welsh cup win by beating Bangor City 4\u20131 at Parc Y Scarlets, Llanelli.", "Llanelli qualified for the Intertoto Cup after finishing third in the Welsh Premier League behind The New Saints and Rhyl. The Reds travelled to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius for the first leg of the first-round game against FK V\u0117tra. Llanelli started the game well, even with a severely depleted squad they managed to take the lead with a fine volley by Andrew Mummford, the brave Reds side went on to lose the game 3\u20131. A magnificent return leg played at Carmarthen's Richmond Park, saw Llanelli come agonizingly close to qualifying. They took the game from 3\u20132 down at half time to score a last minute goal to make it 5\u20133, unfortunately there was not enough time for Llanelli to grab a winner, they went out on away goals with an aggregate score of 6\u20136.

The first leg, which was played in front of a sell out Steboneath Park crowd finished 2\u20132, centre backs Wyn Thomas and Stuart Jones got Llanelli's goals, Chris Holloway was also sent off and handed a 2 match ban. The second leg was played at the Lithuanian national football stadium, Tauras took the lead due to some poor defending only for Chris Llewellyn to equalise. Llanelli again conceded from some poor defending, this time from a corner. The battling Reds side equalised once again, a ball over the top led to Jason Bowen beating the offside trap, he raced clear and neatly slid the ball past the Tauras keeper. With extra time fast approaching, Llanelli had Rhys Griffiths and Craig Moses sent off, somewhat controversially. The Tauras players seemed to make a meal with every challenge. Extra time proved too much for the tired Reds side as Tauras ran out 3\u20132 winners on the night and 5\u20134 on aggregate.", "* Andy Legg (April 2009 \u2013 November 2012)", "* Andy Legg (November 2020 \u2013 November 2021)"]}, {"page": "Throw-in", "response": ["An uncommon but effective technique for delivering a faster than usual throw is the flip throw (notably employed in recent years by, among others, Estonian player Risto Kallaste, and Icelander Stein\u00fe\u00f3r Freyr \u00deorsteinsson): in it the player, during the run-up, plants the ball on the ground, flips over it, and uses the momentum gained from the flip to increase the velocity of the ball.
