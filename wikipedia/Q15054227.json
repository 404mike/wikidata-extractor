As he waited to be interrogated, tortured and subsequently executed, McGartland escaped being assassinated by the IRA by jumping from a third floor window in a Twinbrook flat where he had been taken for interrogation following his abduction, and survived the fall."]}, {"page": "MI5", "response": ["There have been strong accusations levelled against MI5 for having failed in its obligation to provide care for former police agents who had infiltrated the Provisional IRA during the Troubles.  The two most notable of the agents, Martin McGartland and Raymond Gilmour, went on to reside in England using false identities, and in 2012, launched test cases against the agency.  Both men claimed to journalist Liam Clarke in the Belfast Telegraph that they were abandoned by MI5 and were \"left high and dry despite severe health problems as a result of their work and lavish promises of life-time care from their former Intelligence bosses\".  Both men suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."]}]}}
