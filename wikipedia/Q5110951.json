This requirement was abolished in December 2014, nine months after the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 permitted same-sex marriages. In both England and Wales and Scotland, such an application from a married person requires written consent from the spouse \u2013 the so-called spousal veto. However, applicants in Scotland benefit from a workaround, where it is possible for applicants in Scotland to apply to the sheriff court to have their interim GRC replaced with a full GRC, bypassing the \"spousal veto\". Some parliamentarians, such as Evan Harris, viewed the original requirement as inhumane and destructive of the family. MP Hugh Bayley said in the Commons debate \"I can think of no other circumstance in which the state tells a couple who are married and who wish to remain married that they must get divorced\". Despite this opposition, the government chose to retain this requirement of the Bill. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, David Lammy, speaking for the Government, said \"it is the Government's firm view that we cannot allow a small category of same-sex marriages\". It was suggested in the debates that the number of transgender people who have undertaken gender reassignment and who are currently living in a marriage was no more than 200."]}, {"page": "LGBT History Month", "response": ["Patrons of the Month include Cyril Nri, Ian McKellen, Angela Eagle, Gareth Thomas, Aderonke Apata (founder of African Rainbow Family), Tom Robinson, Christine Burns, Peter Tatchell and Labi Siffre."]}, {"page": "List of LGBT rights activists", "response": ["* Christine Burns, trans rights campaigner, formerly a vice president of PfC, awarded MBE for work with PfC and on the GRB"]}, {"page": "The Man Who Would Be Queen", "response": ["The public response of members of the transgender community was almost entirely negative.

Garavelli concludes that the book's convincing argument came from \"the ability to empathise with Forbes's suffering, much more than [Playdon's] proselytizing, that left me wondering why society makes it so difficult for trans people to be themselves.\" Patrick Strudwick in the i newspaper referred to the book as \"one of the most important pieces of investigative journalism ever written about trans people\". For The Times Literary Supplement, Christine Burns considered the book to successfully be a \"complex story compellingly told\" for its ability to fully consider all the aspects of Forbes's case and subsequent events.
