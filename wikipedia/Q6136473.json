He was serving with the British Army during the First World War at the time of the award.\nHutchinson was 20 years old, and a private in the 2/5th Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers (55th (West Lancashire) Division), British Army on 28 June 1916 when his actions in Ficheux, France earned him the Victoria Cross. His citation reads:\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery. During an attack on the enemy's position this soldier was the leading man, and, entering their trench, shot two sentries and cleared two of the traverses.\nAfter our object had been gained and retirement ordered, Private Hutchinson, on his own initiative, undertook the dangerous task of covering the retirement, and he did this with such gallantry and determination that the wounded were removed into safety. During all this time this gallant soldier was exposed to fierce fire from machine-guns and rifles at close quarters.\nHe later achieved the rank of corporal.", "link_mentions": {}}}
