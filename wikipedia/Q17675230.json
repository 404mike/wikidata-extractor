Her father was the architect Philip Mainwaring Johnston. She studied art at The Slade and then theatre at the Central School of Drama. She made her professional stage debut in 1924 as Hippolyta in A Midsummer Night's Dream, at the Richmond Theatre.She was in repertory at the Oxford Playhouse, where her husband Stanford Holme was producer, in the 1930s. She performed for both the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts and the BBC Repertory Company during World War II, as well as directing at the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park. She was also a dramatist, adapting works for stage and radio, including Jane Austen's Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. She subsequently moved with her husband to Carlyle's House in Cheyne Row, Chelsea, London, when he became its curator, working for the National Trust. She took up writing, beginning with a book about the lives of Thomas Carlyle and his wife Jane Welsh Carlyle at the house, The Carlyles at Home (1965).She appeared as a castaway on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 4 October 1969, and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.She died in 1980.

In 1938, the first full-length broadcast of a Shakespearean play took place; Dallas Bower's modern dress production of Julius Caesar at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, starring D.A. Clark-Smith as Mark Antony and Ernest Milton as Caesar (24 July). The following year saw the first feature length made-for-TV production; The Tempest, also directed by Bower, and starring John Abbott as Prospero and Peggy Ashcroft as Miranda (5 February). The vast majority of these transmissions were broadcast live, and they came to an end with the onset of war in 1939. None of them survive now."]}, {"page": "Princess Charlotte of Wales", "response": ["Charlotte was a healthy child, and according to her biographer, Thea Holme, \"The impression one gets from all the early recorded stories of Charlotte is of a happy recklessness, and a warm heart.\"  As Charlotte grew, her parents continued to battle, and to use the young girl as a pawn in their conflict, with both parents appealing to the King and Queen to take their side.  In August 1797, Caroline left Carlton House, establishing herself in a rented home near Blackheath and leaving her daughter behind\u2014English law at the time considered the father's rights to minor children paramount. However, the Prince took no action to further restrict Caroline's access to her daughter.  In December 1798, the Prince invited his estranged wife to spend the winter at Carlton House, which she refused to do. It was the last serious effort at reconciliation, and its failure meant there was little likelihood that George would have a legitimate son who would come between Charlotte and the British throne.  Caroline visited her daughter at Carlton House, and sometimes Charlotte was driven out to Blackheath to visit her mother, but was never allowed to stay in her mother's house.  During the summers, the Prince leased Shrewsbury Lodge at Blackheath for his daughter, which made visiting easier, and according to Alison Plowden, who wrote of George's relationship with his wife and daughter, Caroline probably saw as much of her daughter as she wanted to."]}, {"page": "Carlyle's House", "response": ["== Stanford and Thea Holmes ==", "Theatre producer Stanford Holme became curator of the house and moved there with his wife, the actress Thea Holme in 1959.
