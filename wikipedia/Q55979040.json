After several years gaining experience in Pathology, Findlay became an assistant to Samson Gemmell. During this period he became interested in rickets in children, which later led to an interest in infant malnutrition, that lead to paediatrics. The interest in rickets resulted in Findlay to visit Germany for post-graduate study, to work with Heinrich Finkelstein in Berlin.", "After returning to Glasgow in 1902, Findlay worked at the outpatient's department at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, as well as the dispensary. In 1914, he was appointed a Visiting Physician at the new site of the Royal hospital in Yorkhill in Glasgow.

In 1919, Findlay planned to return to Glasgow but instead was appointed to become Director of child welfare of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Geneva.

In his paper Dalziel described nine patients in which he observed eosinophils, giant cells and granulomas with no infectious agents. The first patient was a professional colleague and upon operating Dalziel found that the whole intestine was chronically inflamed and was unable to restore function with the patient dying. The second patient was seen several years later in Paisley and was more acute and this patient also died. The third patient was called Mrs T by Dalziel and was seen in 1905. Dalzeil operated along with Samson Gemmell  and removed two feet of the jejunum that was found to be infected. In a child of 10 he found a great thickening of the bowel wall and in a description of the pathology described it as having the consistence and smoothness of an eel in a state of rigor mortis. Of the nine patients two died of the disease, the other seven were treated to surgery. Dalziel described common symptoms in all the cases, that were characteristic feature being violent colic that caused vomiting and occasionally an escape of some blood, also constant mucus from the bowel. In the examination of the disease, Dalziel drew particular attention to the bowel, something that Burrill Bernard Crohn, the American gastroenterologist who discovered the disease, did not. Dalziel gave it the name hyperplastic enteritis."]}]}}
