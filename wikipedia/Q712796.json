He has written, produced, and acted in several television and film projects, and authored three books.\nBorn and brought up in Bolton, Kay studied media performance at the University of Salford. He began working part-time as a stand-up comedian, winning the North West Comedian of the Year award. In 1997 he won Channel 4's So You Think You're Funny contest and the following year was nominated for a Perrier Award for his show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. With his public profile raised, in 2000 he co-wrote and starred in That Peter Kay Thing for Channel 4. This resulted in a spin-off sitcom, Phoenix Nights, which ran for two series from 2001 to 2002, and in turn generated another spin-off, Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere, in 2004. In 2005 he recorded a promotional video in which he mimed to Tony Christie's 1971 hit \"(Is This the Way to) Amarillo\", which was being reissued to raise money for Comic Relief; the song then reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming that year's best-selling single in the UK.\nIn 2008 Kay co-wrote and starred in Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice, a parody of several British reality television shows. As the series' fictional protagonist Geraldine McQueen, he released the single \"The Winner's Song\", which reached number 2 in the UK singles chart. His 2010\u20132011 stand-up comedy tour was officially inaugurated into the Guinness World Records as the most successful of all time, playing to over 1.2 million people. He co-wrote and starred in Peter Kay's Car Share, a sitcom screened by the BBC for three series between 2015 and 2018. He also starred in the 2015 BBC sitcom Cradle to Grave.\nIn 2016 Kay won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Male Comedy Performance, the BAFTA TV Award for Best Scripted Comedy and the National Television Award for Best Comedy for Car Share. He also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Salford.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Peter Kay (born 1973)"]}, {"page": "1973", "response": ["* July 2 \u2013 Peter Kay, British comedian "]}, {"page": "Dannii Minogue", "response": ["It was confirmed that Minogue would be one of the new faces of Marks and Spencer.
