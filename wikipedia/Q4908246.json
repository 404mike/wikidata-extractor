After confirming the signing of Adam Yates, who was linked to the club before Adams' arrival, Adams signed Doug Loft, who had also played under him at Brighton. After a pre-season friendly, Adams considered switching to a 3\u20135\u20132 formation for the season. On 21 July, it was announced that Adams had appointed veteran striker Geoff Horsfield as player-assistant manager. He was still strengthening his squad early in the season, signing midfielders Jason Jarrett, Kris Taylor and Claus Bech J\u00f8rgensen on short-term deals. He also signed Jamie Guy on loan from Colchester United, Damien McCrory on loan from Plymouth Argyle, and winger Lewis Haldane from Bristol Rovers \u2013 Haldane would later make the move permanent in January. In order to raise cash he placed six youngsters on the transfer list.", "On the financial side rumours abounded. In July 2009, Bill Bratt spoke out to publicly deny rumours spread on Vale fan sites, specifically rumours of sponsorship deals with Basement Jaxx and Maplin Electronics. Bratt said the rumours were \"inaccurate, spurious and damaging\", claiming the speculation could damage genuine and confidential negotiations. In November, Bratt announced that he was planning to retire as chairman at the end of the season, though he later decided to stay on. Reports that Andy Townsend would be appointed as a football advisor also surfaced, but never transpired. There also came statements that shirt sponsors Harlequin Property would invest \u00a3500,000 into the club, though again this never materialized. Stoke-on-Trent city council gave the club a two-year repayment holiday for a \u00a32.25 million loan taken out in 2005."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The turbulence of Gannon's reign, typified by a bust-up on a pre-match journey that became known as 'busgate', and the boardroom battle between multi-millionaire Water World owner Mo Chaudry and Bill Bratt's Valiant 2001 led some to call the season a 'soap opera farce'. At the end of the campaign Micky Adams returned as manager, giving fans cause for optimism following a highly disappointing season.", "On the financial side, in the pre-season investor Mike Newton announced that he was willing to invest \u00a3400,000 in the club and take the chair of the board. Chairman Bill Bratt claimed to be unhappy with Newton's policy of negotiating in public (who had by then upped his offer to \u00a3500,000), and so Bratt remained as chairman. Newton claimed that his \"efforts to become chairman and to invest in the club have been hampered and made almost impossible\" by Bratt and his board, and said that the reasons giving to reject his investment were \"one long round of excuses\". Bratt was forced to deny claims by Newton that the club were heading for administration under his leadership. In September 2010 Bratt gave up his role as chief executive, but remained as chairman, denying that this decision was influenced by the recent Newton takeover bid. By this time the club's debts were estimated at around \u00a32m, a level described by Bratt as \"manageable\". The nine-man board's share total was valued at \u00a3359,400.", "Facing an EGM, Chaudry's cause was boosted when Broxap CEO Robert Lee announced that he would sell his \u00a350,000 worth of shares to Chaudry, making the board's removal at the EGM more likely (however Broxap later reversed their decision on the day of the EGM). However just ten days before the EGM Bratt announced a ten-year \u00a31.6 million sponsorship deal with Ameriturf Global Sports. A further twist came five days later, when Robbie Williams handed his 24.9% worth of EGM proxy votes over to Port Vale Supporters' Club. Many believed this would ensure the end of Bratt's reign, despite his warning that fans should \"look at other clubs who have gone down this line and they have no longer got their ground and are paying vast sums in rent\". The result of the EGM was a vote of no confidence in the board; directors Peter Jackson and Stan Meigh were voted out, however the controversial '24.9% rule' survived \u2013 to Chaudry's disappointment. Also remaining were chairman Bill Bratt and directors Glenn Oliver and Mike Lloyd, three of the original nine that started the season. Each facing an individual vote, they received 51.07%, 50.64%, and 50.21% of the vote respectively. The three survived as Broxap sold their shares to an unnamed director at the last minute, not to Chaudry as they had originally promised. Speaking of the change of heart from Broxap, Chaudry stated that \"the board have engaged in dirty tricks from day one and there have been more at the 11th hour.\" Many fans expressed disappointment at the result, though Chaudry again announced he \"will not walk away\". The future remained unclear, with both Bratt and Chaudry taking gains and losses from the EGM. The club's constitution required four directors for the board to be considered valid, and so the board welcomed new director Mark Sims, a Chaudry supporter, who was voted on to the board at the EGM after he was sponsored by Robbie Williams. Sims stated his intention of convincing the three original directors of the merits of Chaudry's bid. The board also invited supporters group North London Valiants to nominate a director. The EGM disrupted manager Micky Adams' transfer plans as the club's constitution stipulated that at least four directors must be in place for financial transactions such as issuing new contracts to take place. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club, purchasing \u00a350,000 worth of shares with his own money (though former director Stan Meigh later said that it was he who provided the money) he declared that \"this is a purely footballing decision... I understand that the last few months have been difficult for everyone and am asking all of our supporters to put their differences aside, to support my candidacy for the Board and then to get behind the team in the coming season.\" Supporters' groups opposed to Bill Bratt's chairmanship did not welcome the news. At the end of the season, Stoke-on-Trent city council confirmed that the two-year repayment holiday for a \u00a32.25 million loan taken out in 2005 had come to an end."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Behind the scenes, former chairman Bill Bratt left the club, as a new look board was installed, consisting of chairman Peter Miller, vice-chairman Mike Lloyd, CEO Perry Deakin, and Glenn Oliver; with only Oliver having any connection to the previous Valiant2001 regime. In September, this new board announced that sports construction firm Blue Sky International were planning to invest \u00a38 million into the club. However doubts quickly began to emerge over the deal, and in December the CEO of Blue Sky confirmed that the company had never agreed to any such deal, and that they would not be investing any money into the club.", "On the financial side, hostilities were renewed between Bill Bratt's board and some supporters' groups. The North London Valiants rejected a seat on the board after dismissing the offer as \"hollow and disingenuous\". Bratt resigned as chairman on 29 July, citing a desire to unite the fans, and was replaced by Mike Lloyd. The board of directors at the start of the campaign consisted of: Mike Lloyd (as chairman), Glenn Oliver, Bill Bratt MBE, and Micky Adams (serving as both manager and director). Matchday tickets for adult fans were priced between \u00a320.50 and \u00a321.50 \u2013 the highest minimum price for an adult in the division \u2013 though a BBC survey placed Vale Park as the eighth priciest venue in the league when food and drink were also factored into the equation. Fan unrest emerged on the opening day of the season, as some 500 protesters campaigned outside the ground during the draw with Crawley Town, before putting their views toward new chairman Mike Lloyd when he came to hear their views. Bratt then announced that he would step down as a director in September following planned investment from an anonymous group. This news was enough to end protests by fan group 'Black and Gold Until It's Sold', as the group waited for Valiant2001's influence in the boardroom to cease completely. In September 2011, the anonymous investors were revealed to be sports construction firm Blue Sky International, who planned to plough \u00a35 million into the club in twelve months, as well as a further \u00a32.5 million by 2016. This sum would secure the long-term future of the club.", "Following the announcement of the Blue Sky investment, club CEO Perry Deakin announced his intention to purchase \u00a3100,000 of shares to replace Bill Bratt on the board of directors. Peter Miller, vice-president of the sports and education division of Global Events Group, a consultancy firm based in Atlanta, Georgia, also bought a \u00a3250,000 stake in the club. As a result of the imminent investment and departure of the Valiant2001 directors, fan groups 'North London Valiants' and 'Black and Gold Until It's Sold' announced a cease-fire in their protests. 'North London Valiants' representative Malcolm Hirst said that \"We feel the time has come to forget our political differences and move forward together\"; whilst a 'Black and Gold' spokesman said that \"Sadly, the dream of a fan-owned democratically run club proved beyond our reach and we have to accept that the smaller shareholders will not have any influence on the future direction of the club. The promise of a supporter director on the board is, however, a significant compromise.\" The day after these announcements Longsdon businessman Mark Sims, who had been voted onto the board four months earlier at the club's EGM, withdrew his candidacy after refusing to take on the required financial guarantees. That same day Bill Bratt resigned from the board completely, and was replaced by as a director by CEO Perry Deakin. Peter Miller (formerly of Luton Town) was voted onto the board on 24 October. Miller was also elected chairman seven days later, with Mike Lloyd becoming vice-chairman.", "In November the club were threatened with legal action by Ameriturf, a rival company of Blue Sky that had previously been looking to invest in the club and that had sponsored the pre-season tour of America. Adams stepped down as a director on 5 November, the day of his 100th game in charge at Port Vale. However eleven days later, doubts began to emerge over the Blue Sky deal, as it was revealed that the deal may not go ahead due to 'contractual issues'. Fan groups criticised the board for their lack of transparency on the issue. More fierce criticism came when The Sentinel reported that neither Miller or Deakin had actually purchased \u00a3350,000 worth of shares as they had reported just before they were elected onto the board; a spokesman for the supporters' club said that \"I think Mr Miller and Mr Deakin should be removed from the board. In my opinion, they were elected under false pretences.\" It was also revealed that the club had agreed to pay Miller a salary of \u00a3100,000 a year (former chairman Bill Bratt was unpaid, though received a \u00a350,000 salary as CEO). Peter Miller issued a statement on the Port Vale website decrying the paper's reporting as being \"misleading and unhelpful\", and stating that whilst \"it is common knowledge\", he could \"confirm, beyond all doubt, that these sums have been lodged and \u00a3350,000 has been received by Port Vale Football Club for our [Deakin and Miller's] respective shareholdings.\" Former director Stan Meigh called on Miller to resign. Supporters group 'North London Valiants' further discovered that Deakin and Miller had used their 'nil-paid' shares to vote each other onto the board, as well as the 'nil-paid' shares from Blue Sky (this totalled as \u00a3500,000 worth of unpaid for shares); combined with 'yes' votes from directors Mike Lloyd and Glenn Oliver this rendered voting from other shareholders a mooted exercise. As these facts were revealed, former prospective investor Mo Chaudry offered to lay on hospitality for the Roy Sproson statue unveiling ceremony, as the club had refused to provide refreshments for former players and Sproson family members. On 8 December, Hank Julicher, CEO of Blue Sky International made the following statement:", "On 28 December, The Sentinel reported that 22 days earlier a \u00a3277,000 mortgage was taken out on Vale Park to pay for day-to-day operations. The next day, Deakin, Lloyd and Oliver announced that they had \"carried out a review of Miller... and decided his tenure [as chairman] should cease\" at the end of the calendar year. The leader of Stoke-on-Trent City Council, Mohammed Pervez, told reporters that he was \"concerned\" about the club's ability to repay a \u00a32.25 million loan taken out in 2006, and also confirmed that the mortgage the club had taken out in December breached the loan agreement with the council. In addition to board members, The Sentinel's Martin Tideswell also criticised local MP Joan Walley, the local council, the FA, and the Football League for not acting to protect the club from its directors: \"they fiddle and talk in platitudes while Vale Park burns.\" Meanwhile the club's directors announced that the club's AGM would be held on 13 March, having twice postponed the meeting traditionally held in December. On 25 January, fan groups organised an interim board consisting of Pete Williams (supporters' club chairman); Margaret Sinstadt; Mike Thompstone and Paul Humphreys (both of whom former directors who resigned during the 2010\u201311 campaign) \u2013 the former two finding sponsors with at least a \u00a350,000 stake, and the latter two not requiring a stake due to their status as former directors. Six days later, Ameriturf announced that they would again be interested in investing into the club. However the company that produced the club's matchday programmes threatened the club with legal action after they were allegedly misled over sales figures. In February, Stoke-on-Trent city council confirmed that for the first time the club had missed its monthly repayments of around \u00a319,000 for a \u00a32.25 million loan taken out in 2006. On 25 February, the club were hit with a transfer embargo after failing to payca tax bill, leaving fears of administration more acute than ever following the club's exit from administration in 2003. Peter Miller then quit the board, leaving just three directors; meanwhile club sponsors Harlequin Property began suing the club over the repayment of a \u00a3125,000 loan, and the city council confirmed that it was still owed \u00a39,033 in unpaid loan payments. The players were not paid in February. On 29 February, HM Revenue and Customs issued the club with a winding up petition. Two days later the council proposed putting the club into administration, which was by then the club's only chance of survival. Perry Deakin told the media that he regretted ever getting involved with the club, but laid the blame for the club's collapse at the hands of former chairman Bill Bratt; his parting comment was \"Perhaps in hindsight I was a bit naive. I had a look at the club's website and there didn't appear to be any issues there. I guess I should have looked at The Sentinel's site.\""]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Bill Bratt MBE (born 1945), former chairman of Port Vale."]}, {"page": "Bill Bell (businessman)", "response": ["Horton kept the team from relegation in 1998\u201399, but could not prevent the Vale from suffering the drop in 1999\u20132000 despite Bell giving him the funds to sign new players. Bell also announced that \u00a31\u00a0million had been spent filling in more mine shafts and that Vale were losing \u00a320,000 a week. The financial situation worsened, and the club lost \u00a3400,000 from the collapse of ITV Digital in 2002. Bell put his shares up for sale in November 2002, and sold \u00a340,000 worth of shares, nowhere near enough to pay off the \u00a3593,000 Vale owed the Inland Revenue. In December 2002, the club entered administration with debts of \u00a32.4\u00a0million. The club was taken out of administration by the 'Valiant2001' consortium, and Bill Bratt became the new chairman. Bell maintained a quiet public profile after leaving the club, though held a long running legal dispute with the club over rent owed towards the club shop, which he still owned. He did though make headlines in September 2010, when a dispute with a builder at his Brown Edge home ended with Bell threatening the builder with an axe."]}]}}
