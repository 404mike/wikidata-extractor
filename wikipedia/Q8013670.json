They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor was identified as a nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions."]}, {"page": "Arthur Harden", "response": ["*William John Young"]}, {"page": "William Young", "response": ["* William John Young (1878\u20131942), English biochemist", "* William John Young (pastoralist) (1850\u20131931), Australian company chief executive and station manager", "* W.

Other cofactors, such as ATP and coenzyme A, were discovered later in the 1900s. The mechanism of cofactor activity was discovered when, Otto Heinrich Warburg determined in 1936 that NAD+ functioned as an electron acceptor. Well after these initial discoveries, scientists began to realize that the manipulation of  cofactor concentrations could be used as tools for the improvement of metabolic pathways."]}]}}
