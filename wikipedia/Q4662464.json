Oakville immediately made an impact by posting a seven-game undefeated streak, and recorded the best offensive record. Oakville finished first in the Western Conference, but had points deducted due to discipline related violations. The deduction resulted in Oalville losing their division title by finishing as runners up. In the first round of the postseason the Blue Devils faced the Windsor Border Stars, and advanced to the semi-finals by a score of 3-1. In the semi-finals Oakville faced Hamilton Thunder, and won the match by a score of 2-0. In the CPSL Championship final match Oakville faced Vaughan Shooters during the match the Shooters struck first with a goal from Stalin Cardenas, ten minutes later De Luca scored the equalizer sending the match to overtime where Gamble came off the bench to score the winning goal and capture the organizations first championship title."]}, {"page": "2006 Open Canada Cup", "response": ["|DF ||32|| Aaron Steele || || "]}, {"page": "All-time Toronto Lynx roster", "response": ["*  Aaron Steele"]}, {"page": "Aaron Steele", "response": ["Aaron Steele may refer to:", "* Aaron Steele (footballer, born 1983), English football player active in Canada", "* Aaron Steele (footballer, born 1987), English football player for Brentford and Slough Town", "* Aaron Steele (Guitar Hero), a fictional character in the Guitar Hero video game"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Canadian Soccer League players", "response": ["* Aaron Steele \u2013 Hamilton Thunder, Oakville Blue Devils \u2013 2003, 2005"]}]}}
