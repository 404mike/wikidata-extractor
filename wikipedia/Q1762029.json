His professional career began on his 17th birthday when he signed a professional contract with Derby County after being a trainee. He made his first-team debut under Phil Brown aged 17 as an 84th-minute substitute for Paul Peschisolido in a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Grimsby Town in the 2005\u201306 League Cup, with his league debut coming in a 1\u20131 draw away to Crewe two weeks later as a 73rd minute replacement for Marcus Tudgay. Barnes intermittently made first-team appearances as Derby struggled but began to command a regular place when Phil Brown was replaced by Derby's academy manager Terry Westley in January 2006. Westley was familiar with Barnes from his time as a youngster at Derby and made him an integral part of the team as Derby managed to avoid relegation to League One. Barnes played a role in 16 matches under Westley, with his first start coming in Westley's first match in charge (a narrow 1\u20130 home defeat to Sheffield United) and his first professional goal coming in a 2\u20132 draw away to Watford."]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Marcus Tudgay", "|Marcus Tudgay"]}, {"page": "Akpo Sodje", "response": ["Sodje started the 2008\u201309 season by scoring two goals and setting one up for strike partner Marcus Tudgay in a 4\u20131 win over Burnley.
