Tyler also played one Test match for England on their tour to South Africa in 1895\u201396.\nTyler was a left-handed bowler.  He played much of his early cricket for the Kidderminster Club, and for two years, 1885 and 1886, he was in the Worcestershire eleven, bowling with success in 1885. Then came his connection with Somerset and his fame as a slow bowler.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "E. W. Bastard", "response": ["His first-class career was confined to his university years, when he appeared for both Oxford and Somerset. Close to the top of the bowling averages for both teams in each season, his 62 first-class wickets in 1885 placed him among the 20 most prolific wicket-takers in the country. Somerset's temporary loss of first-class status in 1885 brought a premature end to Bastard's first-class career when he was 23. Although he continued to play for the side in second-class cricket until 1889, by the time Somerset resumed first-class cricket in 1891, Bastard had lost his place following the emergence of Sammy Woods and the acquisitions of Ted Tyler and George Nichols. He died at the age of 39 while engaged in scholastic work in Taunton.", "Bastard graduated from Oxford in 1885, gaining his B.A. that year, and collecting his M.A. three years later. He continued to play cricket for Somerset, who had by this stage been stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches.Foot (1986), pp. 23\u201328. He picked up plenty of wickets, particularly in 1886 and 1887; eleven in a match against Hampshire, with eight in the first innings, fifteen against Devon, and another eight in the first innings against Warwickshire being the highlights. However, the additions of Sammy Woods, Ted Tyler and George Nichols resulted in Bastard bowling less frequently, and he made his final appearance for the county in August 1889 against the MCC. He was not required to bowl in the match, which Somerset won by 9 wickets, thanks to Tyler and Woods. He was described by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as \"the chief bowler in the Somersetshire eleven before the County became first-class.\""]}, {"page": "Arthur Mold", "response": ["During the 1900 season, Fry was once more no-balled at the beginning of June, this time by William West. The concerted action against throwing reached a peak when Phillips umpired the match between Nottinghamshire and Lancashire in Nottingham on 26 June. Early on the first morning of the three-day match, Mold came on to bowl when Nottinghamshire had scored 34. In Mold's first over, Phillips twice no-balled him for throwing. Lancashire's captain, Archie MacLaren, withdrew Mold from the bowling attack at the end of the over and he did not bowl again in the match. However, MacLaren later defended Mold in the press. The match reports in both The Times and Wisden commented that Mold had been lucky never to be no-balled before in his career; he was the most high-profile bowler to be called in the Phillips-led crackdown on bowling actions.Brodribb, p. 157. Mold played another nine times in 1900 without being called for throwing, but he did not play in any of the Lancashire matches umpired by Phillips. Later in the season, Phillips called the Somerset bowler Ted Tyler. By the end of the season, Mold had taken 97 wickets at 14.01."]}, {"page": "Sammy Woods", "response": ["After Somerset's achievements in the previous season, they were granted first-class status and admission to the County Championship in 1891.Foot (1986), p28. This resulted in Woods playing more first-class cricket than in any previous season. He continued to bowl well throughout the season, and finished as Somerset's leading wicket taker in the Championship in 1891, claiming 72 of his 134 wickets for the county. He took ten wickets, and scored a half-century in the match against Yorkshire at Park Avenue, Bradford, and in so doing reached 100 first-class wickets in a season for the first time. Later in the same month, Woods opened the Somerset bowling alongside Ted Tyler against Gloucestershire. The pair claimed five wickets each, bowling Somerset's local rivals out for 25 runs from just 14.2 overs. The total was the lowest score Gloucestershire had made in an innings to that point, and remains their third lowest total. Woods claimed a further three wickets in Gloucestershire's second innings, and Somerset completed an innings victory on day two of the match."]}, {"page": "Arnold Fothergill", "response": ["Fothergill began his career as a club professional in the north east of England. He joined Somerset as one of their first professionals in 1880, but was forced to miss most of 1881 while he qualified for the county. He was the most productive bowler for the county in their first two years of first-class cricket, but the emergence of E. W. Bastard, and later Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods, limited his opportunities with the club. He joined the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1882, and played for the MCC until 1892, also appearing at Lord's for representative sides.", "During the following season, Fothergill only appeared once for Somerset, in a match against Kent early in the season. He took four for 87 in the match, which was his final first-class appearance for the county. Fothergill was again selected to play for the South against the North, but bowled just three overs in the match, without taking a wicket. The remainder of his notable appearances that season were made for the MCC, though few were considered first-class. He performed well in matches against Wiltshire and Leicestershire, taking eleven wickets in each match, including seven for 62 in the second innings against Leicestershire, but neither match had first-class status. In 1885, he enjoyed his best match for the South, taking four wickets in each innings as the North were defeated by nine wickets. The majority of his cricket from 1884 until 1886 was made for the MCC, although he did appear four times in 1886 for Somerset, which had been stripped of its first-class status.Foot (1986), pp. 23\u201328. In contrast, in 1887 and 1888, he played almost exclusively for the county, appearing just three times for the MCC. Somerset, who had relied on the bowling of Fothergill in the early 1880s, were spearheaded by E. W. Bastard, Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods in the late 1880s, and Fothergill was rarely needed to bowl many overs. Despite this, he was presented with a bat during 1888, a reward usually given to batsmen who had scored a century.Roebuck (1991), pp. 43\u201345."]}, {"page": "Lionel Palairet", "response": ["During the 1907 season, Palairet played in all of Somerset's County Championship matches, and also appeared for the county against the touring South African side.

Palairet himself had a disappointing year; his batting average of 21.33 was the lowest in any season in which he played ten or more matches. He passed 50 in an innings on only three occasions, one of these being 116 runs against Kent at Tonbridge, the final century of his first-class career. At the end of the season, in which Somerset finished fourteenth of sixteen teams in the County Championship, Palairet resigned the captaincy. At the club's annual general meeting, in an uncharacteristic outburst he criticised the lack of talent and team spirit . After 1907, made only eight further appearances in first-class cricket, his final match being in 1909 for Somerset against Kent at Taunton, where he scored one run in the first innings and three in the second. Palairet invariably wore a Harlequins cricket cap during matches,Foot (1986), p. 37. and was considered aloof by his colleagues.Roebuck (1991), p. 48. In his complete first-class career he scored 15,777 runs at an average of 33.63, including 27 centuries, and took 143 wickets at a bowling average of 33.91"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Ted Tyler \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Edwin Tyler", "response": ["#redirectTed Tyler"]}, {"page": "Herbie Hewett", "response": ["Hewett led his side in their first County Championship match starting on 18 May 1891. Although the club had played first-class cricket a few years earlier, the championship had only been formed the previous season. Their debut in the competition was interrupted by rain and finished a draw; Hewett top-scored in Somerset's only innings with 31. Somerset's next match was against reigning county champions Surrey. Lionel Palairet, Bill Roe and Sammy Woods were all missing for various reasons, leaving Hewett with a depleted side and only two real bowlers; Ted Tyler and George Nichols. Surrey reached 449, and then bowled Somerset out twice, for 37 in each innings.Foot (1986), pp. 28\u201329. When Surrey travelled to Taunton later that season, most likely expecting an easy win to secure a second consecutive championship, Hewett top-scored for his team with 55 in the first-innings as Somerset reached 194. Woods, Nichols and Tyler then secured a 40 run first-innings lead for the home side who added another 331 runs in their second-innings, Hewett contributing 42. The same trio of Somerset bowlers proceeded to bowl the champions out for a second time, the final wicket falling two minutes from the close of play, and their team recorded a 130-run victory.Foot (1986), pp. 29\u201332. Hewett had a quiet season with the bat, in addition to his 55 against Surrey he passed 50 on only one other occasion; against Middlesex two weeks later.

There was a feeling in the press that the biggest fault lay with the cricket authorities; both the umpires and the MCC; The Daily News, echoed by Cricket magazine, said that \"no blame can possibly attach to a bowler who continues a delivery which is habitual with him ... when the proper authorities decline [to signify] their disapproval of it.\" As a batsman, he was an aggressive tail-ender, while he was considered a good fielder with a long throw. In all first-class matches, Crossland claimed 322 wickets at an average of 10.95. He took ten wickets in a match on six occasions, and five wickets in an innings 25 times. He scored 1,172 runs with a high score of 51. Throwing in cricket came to a head in the early part of the twentieth century when the careers of a number of professional bowlers came to a close, most notably those of Lancashire's Arthur Mold, Somerset's Ted Tyler and Leicestershire's Frederic Geeson.."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Ted Tyler (1891\u20131907) 177 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Ernie Robson", "response": ["In 1895 Robson made his first of 424 first-class appearances for Somerset, claiming two wickets, a duck, 24 runs and a catch during a seven wicket loss to Cambridge University.
