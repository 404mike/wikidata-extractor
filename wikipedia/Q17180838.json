Born in the United Kingdom, where his father, Fred Perlini, played ice hockey, Perlini grew up there before moving to Canada with his family in 2007. He spent four seasons in the major junior Ontario Hockey League (OHL), and made his NHL debut with the Coyotes in 2016. He's also played for the Chicago Blackhawks and Detroit Red Wings.\nInternationally, Perlini played for the Canadian national junior team, and won a bronze medal at the 2014 World Under-18 Championship.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chicago Blackhawks", "response": ["The team adjusted their roster by trading Nick Schmaltz to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for Dylan Strome and Brendan Perlini.

After missing the playoffs for the second straight season, the Blackhawks won the third-overall pick in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft at the NHL Draft Lottery, which they used to select Kirby Dach."]}, {"page": "Arizona Coyotes", "response": ["*2014: Brendan Perlini (12th overall)"]}, {"page": "Barrie Colts", "response": ["The Barrie Colts would begin the season without the previous season's top scorers Tanner Pearson and Ivan Telegin who would play the season in the AHL. Overage defenceman Ryan O'Connor was named team captain. With the likes of Mark Scheifele, Anthony Camara, Steven Beyers, Zach Hall, and former London Knight Andreas Athanasiou, the Colts would continue to pack an offensive punch. Leading the way on defence were returnees Alex Yuill, Johnathan Laser, Aaron Ekblad, and Alex Lepkowski. Overager Mathias Neiderberger was stellar all year in goal. With this crop of experienced players, as well as a handful of rookies to fill in the gaps, the Colts would quickly take the top spot in the Eastern Conference; a position they would hold for the majority of the season. The Colts would also be ranked amongst the CHL Top Ten teams for most of the year as well. Throughout the season, many Colts would say goodbye through trades. Included in this group were Brendan Bell, Sammu Markula, Dylan Smoskowitz, and the Colts 2012 first round draft pick Brendan Perlini. In exchange they would receive many draft picks as well as defenceman Jake Dotchin, and forwards Devon Rymarchuk, and Mitchell Theoret in the hopes that the Colts could make a run deep into the playoffs. Over the Christmas Break, sophomore defenceman Aaron Ekblad would captain Team Ontario's Under 17 squad, and both Anthony Camara, and Mark Scheifele would make Team Canada's Under 20 team. Scheifele would soon after be recalled to the NHL after the lockout was settled. He would remain with the Winnipeg Jets until early February when he was returned to the OHL. The Colts would lock down the 2nd place seed in the Eastern Conference heading into the playoffs. After quickly beating the 7th seed Kingston Frontenacs and 3rd seed Oshawa Generals 4 games to 0 a piece, the Colts would meet the first place Belleville Bulls in the conference finals. The Colts would need 7 games to beat Belleville for a trip to the OHL Championships. No one gave the Colts a chance at winning this series as they would play the defending champions London Knights. After 4 games, the Colts would lead the series 3 games to 1. At this point, injuries to Mark Scheifele and suspensions (10 games for Ryan O'Connor, 5 games for Anthony Camara, and 5 games for Jake Dotchin) would catch up with the Colts. London would win game 5 at home and game 6 in Barrie in thrilling fashion. In game 6 London would hold a 4\u20130 lead with just over 10 minutes left in the third period. The Colts stormed back to score 4 goals before losing in overtime. In game 7 Barrie headed back to London where the game was tied 2\u20132 in the dying seconds of the third period. A miscommunication between the Colts players led to a turnover, and a London goal with 0.1 seconds remaining on the clock to deny the Colts a trip to the Memorial Cup. To add insult to injury, London was awarded the 2014 Memorial Cup early the next day; a tournament that Barrie also had a solid bid for.", "*Brendan Perlini"]}, {"page": "List of Italian Canadians", "response": ["* Brendan Perlini \u2014 ice hockey player"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian national ice hockey team rosters", "response": ["*Brendan Perlini \u2013 Niagara IceDogs"]}, {"page": "List of NHL players (P)", "response": ["* Brendan Perlini"]}, {"page": "List of sportspeople with dual nationality", "response": ["|Brendan Perlini"]}, {"page": "Niagara IceDogs", "response": ["The Niagara IceDogs spent their first seven seasons in St. Catharines in the Jack Gatecliff arena.
