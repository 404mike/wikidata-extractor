These rules are typically those of tort.Ashworth (2006). p.\u00a0292. For example, in R v Pittwood, the defendant was put under a duty to act on account of being contractually obliged to close the gates at a railway crossing.Simester et al. (2010). pp.\u00a0411\u2013412. Similar duties include those of a doctor of his patients, an electrician over a householder he has done work for, parents over their children, and, developed more recently, a police officer over persons he arrests. Included, however, are those of a criminal enterprise, which would not attract tortious liability in the civil law. Where the defendant is liable through an omission and not an act, then a legal duty to act \u2013 rather than a duty of care \u2013 is needed. Andrew Ashworth has criticised the nature of the duty of care requirement as \"decision-making at its retrospective worst\".Ashworth (2006). p.\u00a0293."]}, {"page": "Ben Emmerson", "response": ["Emmerson was the founder editor of the European Human Rights Law Review and is co-author, with Professor Andrew Ashworth QC, of Human Rights and Criminal Justice (Sweet & Maxwell, 3rd Edition), the leading text on the application of the Convention in criminal cases.
