At that time, Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was reputedly faster and more precise (although three years later, it was proved less efficient than advertised). Walter bought the logography's patent and with it opened a printing house to produce books. The first publication of the newspaper The Daily Universal Register was on 1 January 1785. Walter changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to The Times. In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name.

The architect was Robert Kerr and the house was constructed between 1865 and 1874. The family fortune had been made by Walter's grandfather, John Walter I. Originally a coal merchant and underwriter, in 1785 John Walter had established The Daily Universal Register, renamed as The Times in 1788. In 1816, Walter's father, John Walter II purchased the Bear Wood estate in Berkshire from the Crown Estate and in 1822 built a small villa on the site of the present house. Nothing remains of this first building, which was swept away in the gargantuan rebuilding undertaken by Kerr for John Walter III. The cost, \u00a3129,000, , was double the original estimate.", "John Walter I was born in London in 1738. Making, and subsequently losing, a fortune as a coal merchant and underwriter, in 1785, Walter established The Daily Universal Register, \"to record the principal occurrences of the times\".  Renamed The Times in 1788, within twenty years The Thunderer had become the newspaper of record for the British Empire. By a combination of exceptionally fast reporting; The Times' report of Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar was published several days before the British government received the official communique from the Admiralty; and technological innovation, The Times had the first steam-powered printing press; Walter's son, John Walter II, made the newspaper profitable. Some of the revenues were deployed to buy the estate of Bear Wood from the Crown, and in 1822 Walter II built a small villa, in a neoclassical style, on the site. In 1864 his son, John Walter III, employed Robert Kerr to replace his father's villa with an enormous mansion in the Jacobethan style.", "The planning of Bearwood followed very closely the details of Kerr's book. Mark Girouard, in his pioneering study, The Victorian Country House, calls it a \"synopsis [with] interminable offices, corridors, stairs and entrances\". Everything for the house's construction and operation was undertaken on site; the 4,477,000 red bricks used were fired in the Bearwood brick kilns, the gas came from the estate's gasworks,  the \"elaborate and massive joinery\" was carved in the estate's workshops. Michael Hall, the architectural writer, records that 380 workmen were on the Bearwood site in 1868. The final cost of the house came to \u00a3129,000, double Kerr's estimate. His attempts to negotiate an increase on his commission were unsuccessful. By the time of the house's completion, Walter's stupendous income from The Times, \u00a350,000 a year in 1865, was beginning to falter. The Times' circulation, already declining, came under more sustained assault in the decades ahead, with the rise of the middle-market newspapers, in particular the Daily Mail. In 1908, John Walter's grandson, John Walter V, saw control of the paper pass to the Mail's founder, Lord Northcliffe.", "In 1911 John Walter V put the Bearwood estate up for sale. It failed to secure a buyer, and during the First World War, the house was used as a billet for Canadian soldiers. In 1919, the house with some of the grounds was purchased by Sir Thomas Lane Devitt, chairman of the shipping company Devitt and Moore and founder of the Naval College at Pangbourne. The purchase enabled Devitt to relocate the Royal Merchant Navy School from its original site in central London."]}, {"page": "Barkham Brook", "response": ["The tributary begins at Longmoor Lake, which covers  and is situated in California Country Park. It was created by John Walter III, who extended an original pond after he bought the land to expand his Bearwood Estate in 1873. The clay which was excavated to construct the lake was used to make bricks. In the 1930s, the area became the California-in-England holiday camp, with attractions including a speedway track, but became a designated Country Park in 1980. The outflow from Longmoor Lake flows through Longmoor Bog, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) covering , notable because it is one of the few base-poor valley mires in Berkshire. It includes an area of wet heathland, where peat sits on top of an underlying layer of clay, resulting in a ferruginous swamp, characterised by rust-coloured iron bacteria. Around the waterlogged mire are carrs of alder, grey willow, downy birch and alder buckthorn, while the swamp is populated by purple moor grass and cross-leaved heath.", "At the western edge of Longmoor Bog, the brook is crossed by Park Lane, and turns to the north along the perimeter of the former Arborfield Garrison, which closed in 2015 to be re-developed for housing. After passing under Biggs Lane, it enters another lake, and then crosses open countryside to join the main channel, the combined flow continuing northwards until it is crossed by the B3349 Barkham Road. It is joined by a stream flowing westwards from the lakes at Barkham Manor. The grade II listed manor house was built on a moated site in the 17th century, and was enlarged in the 18th and 19th centuries, after which it was altered in the 20th century. It was the home of John Walter, and Mary Ball, the mother of George Washington, was born there. The brook continues to the north-west, and its flow is augmented by the treated effluent from Arborfield Sewage Treatment Works. The works is authorised to discharge 4.75 Ml per day into the river, but on 29 September 2013 discharged untreated effluent, resulting in serious pollution and the death of fish, other fauna and vegetation. Thames Water were fined \u00a3150,000 for that particular incident, as part of a much larger fine for five other incidents elsewhere.", "To the west of the works, the brook turns to the north, and passes under the B3030 Mole Road at Mole Bridge Farm, where there is a weir. Shortly afterwards, it is joined by the outflow from Bear Wood Lake, which is located in the grade II* listed parks and gardens belonging to Bearwood College. John Walter II bought the Bearwood Estate in the early 19th century, and employed J W Sanderson to build a classical villa. He also enlarged the lake to its present size of . Walter's son, John Walter III rebuilt the house between 1865 and 1874, employing Robert Kerr as the architect. In 1919 the building became the Merchant Seamen's Orphanage, and then a boarding school. The lake was created by constructing a compacted clay dam across the small stream than ran through the grounds. The catchment area for supplying the lake is very small, at only , encompassing the school grounds, a golf course, a large area of woodland and runoff from a small residential area. The lake was estimated to hold around 313.6 Ml, but this was increased to 327.2 Ml by raising the surface level by  in the 1990s. Historically, water from the lake powered a sawmill situated near the dam, which had ceased to operate by the 1960s. A pumping station is located on the crest of the dam, and water is abstracted for irrigation of the golf course. Because the volume of water impounded by the dam exceeds 25 Ml, the lake is considered to be a reservoir under the terms of the Reservoir (Safety Provisions) Act 1930, and visual imspections are made every week by a Reservoir Supervisor Engineer, while the crest of the dam is regularly surveyed for any signs of settlement of the dam, of which there were none as of 2014."]}]}}
