Around this time, Hodson decided to start a mission at Gubbi, which a native town in the Mysore Kingdom. The reason for Hodson choosing Gubbi to set up the mission was because in Bangalore, he found that his time and efforts were taken away in preaching to the British and European officers, and he could not concentrate on the local population. However, the Gubbi mission was temporarily abandoned and Hodson returned to Bangalore, and had to take up the role of supervisor of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission.", "For some time, Hodson was involved in managing the Tamil works at Bangalore.
