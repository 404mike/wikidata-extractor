Meteorological organisations had allowed the university to use this data on the understanding that it would be kept private, largely due to its commercial value. Jones made a Freedom of Information request for raw data which the university had shared with another researcher, but refused to provide to McIntyre. The university worked with the Met Office to get meteorological organisations to waive confidentiality on raw instrumental data, most failed to respond and two refused. In 2011 the Information Commissioner's Office decided that the university had to make the data public, regardless of the wishes of its owners. Jones said to BBC News that it was a matter of principle, \"This dataset wasn't particularly interesting, but we thought the data in general should be available, and we thought people shouldn't have to make FoI requests for it.\" The decision was described as a \"landmark ruling\" and a \"victory for critics of the UEA\" by Fred Pearce of The Guardian.

She provides accounts of the 1948 Donora smog in her hometown, the 1952 Great Smog of London, and other events.  She also criticizes industry interests who dismiss evidence they dislike as \"junk science.\" The book was a finalist for that year's National Book Award for Nonfiction. Public health philosopher Kristin Shrader-Frechette praised it as \"the best book on public health and environmental pollution of the last 30 years.\" Science writer Fred Pearce in New Scientist called Davis a \"a hero with a nose for trouble\" and drew comparisons to Rachel Carson, the author of Silent Spring.  Other writers have compared and Davis and Carson, both in their styles and themes of writing and their small town Pennsylvania upbringings. Epidemiologist Bert Brunekreef wrote the book is \"at its best when describing how commercial interests have harassed well known environmental health scientists in attempts to downplay the seriousness of, say, the effects of environmental lead on the IQ of children,\" but found \"an alarming number of errors\" regarding air pollution.", "Davis' second book, The Secret History of the War on Cancer, was published in 2007. In it, she argues medical institutions involved in the \"war on cancer\" have focused more on cures then prevention, and that some safety research into environmental toxicity is conflicted due to funding from companies who make  products suspected of causing harm. James Huff, associate director for chemical carcinogenesis of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, called it \"exhaustively researched and deftly written, illuminat[ing] more of the truth about chemicals and cancer and the relatively simple means of preventing or reducing cancer burdens.\" Epidemiologist Richard Clapp called the book \"a welcome addition to the struggle to correct the imbalance\" between curative and preventative research, while science writer Fred Pearce wrote it \"is a rattling good read and raises vital issues that remain relevant today.\" In a positive review, science journalist Dan Fagin called Davis \"her generation's strongest advocate of the idea that synthetic chemicals are a seriously under-recognized cause of cancer.\"  Medical historian Peter Keating, however, found the book \"largely unoriginal\" and poorly organized. Epidemiologist Peter Boyle wrote that \"devotees of conspiracy theories and aficionados of gossip and innuendo will be drawn towards this book like wasps to a juicy piece of meat\" and discussed how the book suggested that the link between tobacco and cancer was used to distract from other possible sources."]}, {"page": "Pearce (surname)", "response": ["*Fred Pearce (born 1951), English journalist"]}, {"page": "Climatic Research Unit email controversy", "response": ["The panel did rebuke the CRU for their reluctance to release computer files, and found that a graph produced in 1999 was \"misleading,\" though not deliberately so as necessary caveats had been included in the accompanying text.

Both were astrophysicists at the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics:  Soon had for a long time said that climate change was primarily due to solar variation, while Baliunas had previously been noted for disputing that man-made chemicals (halocarbon refrigerants such as CFCs) were causing ozone depletion. They prepared a literature review which used data from previous papers to argue that the Medieval Warm Period had been warmer than the 20th century, and that recent warming was not unusual. They sent their paper to one of the editors of Climate Research,  Chris de Freitas, an opponent of action to curb carbon dioxide emissions who has been characterized by Fred Pearce as a \"climate contrarian\". describes de Freitas as \"a man with known sceptical views\" and a \"climate contrarian\" who \"was a driving force behind the creation of an early sceptic organisation in Canada, Friends of Science\",Also, see  Unusually for a peer reviewed journal, Climate Research at the time did not have one Editor in Chief that would distribute submitted papers amongst its editors, leaving its authors free to \"shop around\" for one that would be friendly to their views.", "Initially, the scientists whose work was being disputed by Soon and Baliunas felt it was one of a series of sceptical papers that, in Mann's words, \"couldn't get published in a reputable journal\". In March he wrote to Phil Jones that \"I believed our only choice was to ignore this paper. They've already achieved what they wanted, the claim of a peer-reviewed paper. There is nothing we can do about that now, but the last thing we want is to bring attention to the paper.\" Jones replied \"I think the sceptics will use this paper to their own ends and it will set  paleo  back a number of years if it goes unchallenged. I will be emailing the journal to tell them I'm having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor\", referring to de Freitas. At the time the second Soon et al. paper was publicised, Mann emailed Fred Pearce to say that it \"was absurd, almost laughable (if it wasn't, as is transparently evident, being used as a policy\u2013and politics\u2013driven publicity stunt to support the dubious positions on climate change of some prominent American politicians)\", and added that the paper made no attempt to find if the past warm temperatures it reported were contemporaneous or merely one-off scattered events."]}, {"page": "Kingdom of Benin", "response": ["Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist:"]}]}}
