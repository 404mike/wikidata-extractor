Janine is the lowliest member of staff at the shop, running the much derided \"Pay As You Go\" section. She considers herself to be underappreciated and her talents undervalued, yearning for more responsibility and higher status within the team, but when she is briefly given some authority, she is largely ignored. She has occasional flashes of almost psychotic rage before quickly recovering her composure. Janine has a colourful history with men; she persuades Christopher to pretend to be her thuggish, criminal boyfriend in order to make an ex partner jealous. She falls in love with an apparently sophisticated and educated Scotsman, much to the chagrin of Jerwayne, but ends the relationship when it emerges that he is a waste disposal technician, who plans to marry Janine and add her visual image to his van. She claims to have once been a hand model doubling for Princess Diana. Janine quickly forms a bond with Christopher, the other low status PhoneShop employee and continues to involve him in her schemes to gain the attention of Lance and win the promotion she so badly covets, but the recognition she seeks never comes. Frustrated, she almost leaves the team to partner up with Shelley, but this brief friendship falls apart when Shelley hires a troupe of male escorts who, to Janine's disgust, turn out to be two sexually repulsive regulars from the local pub (see under Shelley, below). Janine is fashion conscious and often dresses in distinctive outfits. She speaks in a soft voice with a slight South London accent. Janine does have some surprising talents - being fluent in Mandarin, revealed to her regional manager PA's astonishment."]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2011", "response": ["|| Director: Ben Wheatley   Cast: Neil Maskell, Michael Smiley, Emma Fryer"]}, {"page": "Chickens (TV series)", "response": ["* Emma Fryer as Nellie"]}, {"page": "Critical (TV series)", "response": ["* Emma Fryer as Rebecca Osgood, Orthopaedic Registrar "]}, {"page": "Funny Women", "response": ["** Emma Fryer (Finalist)"]}, {"page": "In the Dark (British TV series)", "response": ["*Emma Fryer as Linda Bates, the wife of Stephen Bates who is the main suspect in the abduction of two young girls."]}]}}
