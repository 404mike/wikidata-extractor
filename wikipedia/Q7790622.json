He was a miner and held various offices in the National Union of Mineworkers including vice-president of the Derbyshire area. He was a councillor on Derbyshire County Council.\nSwain was elected to Parliament in the 1959 general election. He died in a road accident in Chesterfield in March 1979 at the age of 67, and his seat was vacant when the general election was called for that May. Four weeks after his death, the Government lost a vital vote of confidence by a single vote, leading to the election which brought Margaret Thatcher to power. Had he not been killed, the vote of confidence would have ended in a tie and, by precedent, the Speaker's casting vote would have gone to the Government.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Thomas Swain"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Thomas Swain"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Swain"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Swain"]}, {"page": "Tom Swain", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Swain"]}, {"page": "Thomas Henry Swain", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Swain"]}, {"page": "Swain, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Swain"]}]}}
