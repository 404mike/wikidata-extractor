Charles Thorp was appointed acting warden in December 1831 by Bishop William van Mildert, and in 1834 he was appointed to the position on a permanent basis by the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral (who were then the governors of the University). After Thorp's death in 1862, the post of Warden was held ex officio by the Dean of Durham, with Sub-Warden (which had previously been rotated between the professors of the University) becoming a permanent post, presaging the vice-chancellorship.  From 1909, with the creation of the federal university,  and the handing over of the dean and chapter's responsibilities to the newly-formed council, the executive and formal roles were officially separated into the vice-chancellor (executive head) and the chancellor (formal head), with the warden becoming the chancellor and the sub-warden becoming the vice-chancellor. The vice-chancellor was elected by the council to serve a two-year term. In 1937 the permanent posts of Warden of the Durham Colleges and Rector of King's College were created, with the vice-chancellorship being held by each for two years at a time.", "* 1831 \u2013 1834 Charles Thorp (acting)", "* 1834 \u2013 1862 Charles Thorp"]}]}}
