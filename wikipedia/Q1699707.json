He made his first team debut for Celtic in March 1963, in a match against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park. Cushley found himself in the shadow of his teammate and former schoolmate, Billy McNeill, and many of his appearances for Celtic were dependent on McNeill's absence due to injury or international appearances. Nonetheless, Cushley played 41 games for Celtic, until he left the club in 1967 in a \u00a310,000 transfer to West Ham United.As well as his football career, Cushley was a graduate in modern languages from the University of Glasgow and worked as a teacher. In 1964, he acted as a Spanish translator when he and team manager Jimmy McGrory travelled to Spain in an unsuccessful attempt to sign Real Madrid legend Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano to Celtic. During his two years in London with West Ham, Cushley also worked as a teacher.\nIn 1970, he returned to Scotland, playing for Dunfermline Athletic and Dumbarton before retiring in 1976. He continued teaching, and joined Celtic's coaching staff as an education officer.In 2007, Cushley was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, the same illness that had claimed his Celtic teammate Jimmy Johnstone in 2006. He died at his home in Bothwell on 24 March 2008, aged 65.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2007\u201308 in English football", "response": ["*24 March 2008 \u2013 John Cushley, 65, Scottish defender who spent three seasons at West Ham United in the late 1960s, and also played for Celtic, Dunfermline and Dumbarton north of the border.
