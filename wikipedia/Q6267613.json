The breakdown has been primarily attributed to Morrissey's irritation with Marr's work with other artists and Marr's frustration with Morrissey's musical inflexibility.

The adoption of a new name was common among followers of the religion and served to signify a spiritual rebirth for the participant.  Shortly after McGuinn's name change, the band entered the studio to record the Crosby-penned, non-album single \"Lady Friend\", which was released on July 13, 1967.  The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan has described \"Lady Friend\" as \"a work of great maturity\" and \"the loudest, fastest and rockiest Byrds' single to date\".  Regardless of its artistic merits, however, the single stalled at a disappointing number 82 on the Billboard chart, despite the band making a number of high-profile television appearances to promote the record.  Crosby, who had closely overseen the recording of the song, was bitterly disappointed by the single's lack of success and blamed Gary Usher's mixing of the song as a factor in its commercial failure.", "Following their stay in Nashville, the band returned to Los Angeles and throughout April and May 1968, they worked on completing their new country-oriented album.  During this period, Parsons attempted to exert a controlling influence over the group by pressuring McGuinn to recruit either JayDee Maness or Sneaky Pete Kleinow as the band's permanent pedal steel guitar player.  When McGuinn refused, Parsons next began to push for a higher salary, while also demanding that the group be billed as \"Gram Parsons and the Byrds\" on their forthcoming album.  Even Hillman, who had previously been Parsons' biggest supporter in the band, began to grow weary of his forceful demands.  Ultimately, Parsons' behavior led to a power struggle for control of the group, with McGuinn finding his position as band leader challenged.  However, biographer Johnny Rogan has pointed out that the April 1968 release of \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" served to strengthen McGuinn's position as head Byrd, with the guitarist's familiar drawl occupying the lead vocal spot and negligible input from Parsons, despite the single's obvious country leanings.", "The two-record (Untitled) album was released by the Byrds on September 14, 1970, to positive reviews and strong sales, with many critics and fans regarding the album as a return to form for the band.  Peaking at number 40 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and number 11 in the UK, the album's success continued the upward trend in the band's commercial fortunes and popularity that had begun with the release of the Ballad of Easy Rider album.  The live half of (Untitled) included both new material and new renditions of previous hit singles, including \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\" and a 16-minute version of \"Eight Miles High\", which comprised the whole of one side of the original LP release.  Band biographer Johnny Rogan has suggested that the inclusion of these newly recorded live versions of older songs served to forge a spiritual and musical link between the Byrds' current line-up and the original mid-1960s incarnation of the band.", "After the tour wound down in late 1985, Clark returned to his solo career, leaving Michael Clarke to soldier on with a band that was now billed as \"A Tribute to the Byrds\" (although again, it was often shortened to the Byrds by promoters).  Gene Clark returned to the group following the release of his and Carla Olson's So Rebellious a Lover album, and the tribute band continued to work on and off in 1987 and 1988.  Author Johnny Rogan has stated that most die-hard fans of the Byrds were mortified by the existence of this ersatz version of the group, while Byrds expert Tim Connors has commented that \"no chapter in the history of the Byrds caused as much consternation and controversy among fans\"."]}, {"page": "Moondance", "response": ["Morrison's lyrics on Moondance deal with themes of spiritual renewal and redemption. It departed from Astral Weeks discursive, stream-of-consciousness narratives as the singer balanced his spiritual ideas with more worldly subject matter, which biographer Johnny Rogan felt offered the record a quality of \"earthiness\". As a counterpart to Astral Weeks, AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny believed it \"retains the previous album's deeply spiritual thrust but transcends its bleak, cathartic intensity\" by rejoicing in \"natural wonder\". According to Christgau, the essence of Morrison's spirit was, much like the African-American music that inspired him, \"mortal and immortal simultaneously: this is a man who gets stoned on a drink of water and urges us to turn up our radios all the way into the mystic.\" His \"giddy\" preoccupation with \"natural wonder\" on the album was a product of the new approach to composition and the mellow feel of his new band, Harrington said. In his opinion, the record's exuberant spirit and theme of self-affirmation were partly inspired by the singer having \"settled into a life of domestic bliss\". Musicologist Brian Hinton argued that Morrison was celebrating a \"natural alternative\" in his music after quitting soft drugs around this time because they had impeded his productivity."]}, {"page": "Sweetheart of the Rodeo", "response": ["The Byrds' biographer, Johnny Rogan, has said that the album \"stood alone as a work almost completely divorced from the prevailing rock culture. Its themes, mood and instrumentation looked back to another era at a time when the rest of America was still recovering from the recent assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.\"  Ultimately, the Byrds' experimentation with the country genre on Sweetheart of the Rodeo was slightly ahead of its time, to the detriment of the band's commercial fortunes, as the international success of country rock-flavored bands like the Eagles, America and Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show during the 1970s demonstrated."]}, {"page": "Astral Weeks", "response": ["The critical recognition and renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison's subsequent work, as well as Morrison himself.Jones (2008), p. 54. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was \"all too often crystallized in a single moment. Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed.\" Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later said he should have \"changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey\u00a0... four or five other songs should have had a change of mood.\" According to Robert Christgau in 1974, \"Astral Weeks is still considered unlistenable obscure by many astute observers\". Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: \"To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word\u2014I'm so moved by it.\" In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: \"Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between\".Ford (1997), pp. 164\u2013165"]}, {"page": "Stephen Street", "response": ["After The Smiths broke up, Street was producer and co-songwriter for Morrissey's debut solo album Viva Hate, which reached No. 1, spawning two top 10 hits in the UK.

Street was credited as producer, songwriter, guitarist, and bass guitarist on the album.

Although the song was regarded by many critics as a leap forward in terms of musical sophistication upon its release, it was actually written in 1962, two years before the formation of the Byrds.  Originally written as a nightclub torch song, Crosby had recorded demos of \"Everybody's Been Burned\" as early as 1963.  An acoustic recording of the song by Crosby, dating from this pre-Byrds period, was eventually released on the archival album Preflyte Plus in 2012.

It was just a little story and what it said was true... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love.\"  Although \"Mind Gardens\" is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has commented that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious."]}, {"page": "Dancing in the Street", "response": ["Nonetheless, \"Dancing in the Street\" was panned by critics for being too boring.

Band biographer Johnny Rogan has stated that the two most distinctive features of the Byrds' rendition of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" are the vocal harmonies of Clark, McGuinn, and Crosby, and McGuinn's jangling twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar playing (which complemented the phrase \"jingle jangle morning\" found in the song's lyric).  This combination of 12-string guitar work and complex harmony singing became the band's signature sound during their early period.

The song's lyrics describe an attempt on the part of the singer to reject the cynicism that comes with being an adult in favor of the innocence of childhood. Thematically, the song recalled the title of the Byrds' previous album, Younger Than Yesterday, and the understated pedal steel guitar playing of Red Rhodes gives the track a subtle country flavor.", "Over the years, The Notorious Byrd Brothers has gained in reputation and is often considered the group's best work, while the contentious incidents surrounding its making have been largely forgotten. The album managed to capture the band at the height of their creative powers, as they pushed ahead lyrically, musically and technically into new sonic territory. Band biographer Johnny Rogan has written that the Byrds' greatest accomplishment on the album was in creating a seamless mood piece from a variety of different sources, bound together by innovative studio experimentation.

As the band's biographer Johnny Rogan has remarked, the song's wheel of fortune motif certainly seemed applicable, but the song actually predated the reunion, as Clark explained during a 1979 interview: \"I'd already recorded that song a couple of years earlier and it wasn't really written about anything specific. It was just an idea I had.\"  Not only had the song been written by Clark prior to the Byrds' reunion, but by the time that Byrds was released, it had also recently been issued under the alternate title of \"Full Circle Song\" on Clark's Roadmaster album.", "The largely unenthusiastic press reaction to the album caused the individual members of the band to lose faith in the concept of an ongoing, periodic series of band reunions and ultimately, all five members returned to their own careers following the album's release.  In the following years, the band themselves would echo many of the sentiments expressed by the music press, with the general consensus being that the recording of the album was rushed and ill-thought out.  Clark offered his thoughts on the album during a 1977 interview: \"I am disappointed in that album. Some of the harsh criticism is unjust, because, if you listen to it carefully, the album isn't that bad, but it just hasn't got the punch that it could have had if we'd taken the time.\"  Hillman concurred with Clark, telling the Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan, \"In all honesty, we didn't have enough time on the album. They gave us one-and-a-half months to do that album, expecting guys to regroup after a five to six year absence.\"  Hillman also cited the band's eagerness to avoid conflict as a contributing factor to the album's artistic failure: \"everybody was so afraid of stepping on the other person's feet because of the tension that had gone down six years prior to that, that it became a bland album. Everybody was being too nice to each other.\"  McGuinn blamed the reunion album's lack of success, at least partly, on the hedonism exhibited by members of the band during the recording process: \"David had this incredibly strong pot. Half a joint and you couldn't do anything. We were stoned out of our minds the whole time. I don't remember much recording.\""]}, {"page": "The Byrds (box set)", "response": ["The compilation includes a number of rare and previously unreleased songs, many of which were later included as bonus tracks on the remastered editions of the band's individual albums.  Of special interest to fans of both the Byrds and country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, was the inclusion of six previously unreleased tracks from the recording sessions of the Byrds' 1968 album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo.  Of these unreleased tracks, the versions of \"The Christian Life\", \"You Don't Miss Your Water\", and \"One Hundred Years from Now\" featured their original Parsons' lead vocals, which had been removed and replaced by McGuinn and Hillman prior to the release of the album.  Author Johnny Rogan has remarked that in the years since Sweetheart of the Rodeo was issued, these \"lost\" Parsons' vocals had become near-legendary among fans of the band and their inclusion on The Byrds provided a major selling point for the box set."]}]}}
