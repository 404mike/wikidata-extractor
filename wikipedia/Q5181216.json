Star striker Dougie Imrie missed the game through injury, which he picked up in the previous game, as did Steven Masterton, who was suffering from a knee injury. Michael McGowan and Gary Arbuckle were both suspended, after picking up their second yellow cards of the competition at the semi final stage. Goalkeeper David Hutton made only his fourth appearance for the club, with the consistent trio of Craig McKeown, Neil McGregor and Chris Higgins in front of him. The suspension to McGowan meant a rare start for Ryan McCann at right wing back, with Eddie Malone took up position on the opposite flank. Captain Paul McHale played in the middle of the park, alongside Craig Bryson and Stephen O'Donnell, with Andy Ferguson and Roddy Hunter forming the attack. The squad was so stretched that manager Joe Miller named himself amongst the substitutes.", "|CB ||5 || Craig McKeown "]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Dundee F.C. season", "response": ["||| DF|| Craig McKeown"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Dundee F.C. season", "response": ["|DF||||Craig McKeown", "|1||||Craig McKeown"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Dundee F.C. season", "response": ["||| DF|| Craig McKeown", "|  Craig McKeown"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Dundee F.C. season", "response": ["| Craig McKeown"]}]}}
