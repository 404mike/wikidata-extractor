The following morning two more British frigates under Commodore Robert Swanton arrived after having sailing upstream. Swanton in response to the expressed wishes of Murray, gave orders to  and HMS Lowestoffe, soon followed by , to pass the town and to attack the French vessels under Captain Jean Vauquelin in the river above. Swanton forced the French to cut their cables and a running battle soon ensued. Swanton eventually drove L\u00e9vis' six smaller ones aground, British troops then took the men ashore prisoner. The frigates were then able to line up against the French trenches to enfilade them with grape and round shot which forced their abandonment. Murray at the same time having no longer being felt constrained by his ammunition supplies then unleashed a tremendous barrage of artillery fire against the French as he intended to launch an attack against the French siege positions the next morning. A total of 2,913 shots were fired by the British on this day alone which was enough to drive the French from their trenches once more. It was reported that the French in that time managed to fire off only four shells."]}, {"page": "Swanton, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Swanton"]}]}}
