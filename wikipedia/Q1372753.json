Their six children included Anna Gurney, an Old English scholar, and Hudson Gurney (1775\u20131864), who later inherited wealth from his father and acted as the head of the Norwich Gurney family. He became MP for Newtown, Isle of Wight in 1816, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1818 and High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1835. He resided in Keswick Hall near Norwich and in St James's Square, London, but remained childless, so that his fortune was inherited mainly by John Henry Gurney Sr. (1819\u20131890).", "Gurney's Bank in Norwich was at that time in the hands of Samuel Gurney's brother Daniel Gurney (1791\u20131880) and Joseph John Gurney's son John Henry Gurney Sr. (1819\u20131890). The latter had inherited Hudson Gurney's fortune in 1864. He later made a home at Northrepps, near Cromer, where he pursued ornithology. His son, John Henry Gurney Jr., also an ornithologist, and his great-great-grandson, Henry Richard Gurney of Heggatt Hall, continued that family tradition. Besides managing his banking business, Daniel Gurney served as High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1853 and took an interest in archaeology and genealogy. In 1848 he printed in two volumes for private circulation an elaborate The Record of the House of Gournay, adding a supplement in 1858. Daniel Gurney was married to a daughter of William Hay, 17th Earl of Erroll and lived near North Runcton, Norfolk. Their son Charles Henry Gurney (1833\u20131899) graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge and married a daughter of Henry Thoby Prinsep. Later he became a partner in Saunderson's Bank, London. The Gurneys remained active in banking until 1896, when eleven private banks controlled by Quaker families joined together under the name Barclays to meet competition from the joint-stock banks. The largest components of the newly formed conglomerate were Barclay Bevan Ransom Tritton Bouverie & Co, of Lombard Street in the City of London, Backhouse's Bank and Gurney's Bank.", "******John Henry Gurney Sr. (1819\u20131890) m. 1846 Mary Jary (1829\u20131872) and had 2 children, including:"]}, {"page": "John Henry Gurney", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Henry Gurney Sr."]}, {"page": "John Henry Gurney Jr.", "response": ["Gurney was born on 31 July 1848 in Easton Lodge, Easton, Norfolk,Norfolk, England, Church of England Births and Baptisms, 1813-1915 son of John Henry Gurney Sr. and his second cousin Mary Jary Gurney.
