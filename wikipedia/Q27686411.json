An early review by Amber McNaught in the West Lothian Herald & Post said Boyle's rendition of \"Cry Me a River\" was \"heartbreaking\" and \"had been on repeat in my CD player ever since I got this CD...\" The recording found its way onto the internet following her first televised appearance and the New York Post said it showed that Boyle was \"not a one-trick pony.\" Hello! said the recording \"cement[ed] her status\" as a singing star."]}]}}
