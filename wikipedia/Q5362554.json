While some later users of the story focused on the midwifery claims in the opening line, for example arguing that men were midwives before women were, or that women were midwives first, others have concentrated on what Agnodice is supposed to have learned from Herophilus, which was medicine rather than midwifery. Thus she was used both in the peak of men-midwifery in the eighteenth century and in women's struggle to enter the medical profession in the nineteenth century. Elizabeth Cellier, the seventeenth century \"Popish midwife\", positioned herself as a modern Agnodice. Although she appears in a list of 'Who discovered/invented what', she is represented more as someone who bridges the gap between the knowledge of male doctors (\"a certain Herophilus\") and the delivery of this knowledge to women who are embarrassed to show their bodies to a male doctor.

In January 1680 the case was argued before the Council and Scroggs was acquitted. Scroggs repeated the attacks he had made on Oates' credibility at Wakeman's trial, and the King expressed his full confidence in him.  At the trials of Elizabeth Cellier and of Lord Castlemaine in June of the same year, both of whom were acquitted, he discredited Dangerfield's evidence, calling him \"a notorious villain ... he was in Chelmsford  gaol\",  and on the former occasion committed the witness to prison. In the same month he discharged the grand jury of Middlesex before the end of term in order to save the Duke of York from indictment as a popish recusant, a proceeding which the House of Commons declared to be illegal, and which was made an article in the impeachment of Scroggs in January 1681. The dissolution of Parliament put an end to the impeachment, but the King now felt secure enough to dispense with his services, and in April Scroggs, much it seems to his own surprise, was removed from the bench, although with a generous pension. He retired to his country home at South Weald  in Essex; he also had a town house   at Chancery Lane  in London, where  he died on 25 October 1683."]}, {"page": "Thomas Dangerfield", "response": ["Mrs Elizabeth Cellier, in whose house the meal tub was found, was a well- known Roman Catholic   "]}, {"page": "Missenden Abbey", "response": ["*Elizabeth Cellier, Catholic midwife"]}, {"page": "Miles Prance", "response": ["Berry, Green, and Hill were arrested, and Fr.

At this period, the Church of England licensed them. Obstetrics was the subject of demarcation, under which surgeons, rather than physicians, dealt with difficult deliveries. A generation earlier, in 1616. midwives had asked the College of Physicians for permission to organise themselves, a petition forwarded and possible prompted by Peter Chamberlen the younger. His son had suggested himself, in 1634, as governor of a midwifery college, but lost the support of the midwives themselves. His 1647 effort was opposed by the College of Physicians, and was no more successful than the two previous attempts to bring the licensing and control of midwifery under the Chamberlens. The issue continued to be raised. Nicholas Culpeper published a Directory for Midwives in 1651, prompting a rival manual of 1656, in which a member of the Chamberlen family had a hand.
