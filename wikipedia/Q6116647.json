He played for several teams including Sheffield Wednesday, Notts County and Aston Villa. When he was transferred to Sheffield Wednesday from Notts County, for \u00a334,500, he was the most expensive signing in English football. When Sewell captained the newly independent nation of Zambia in October 1964, he became one of the few footballers who have played for two different countries. He was the last living footballer who played in the Match of the Century on 25 November 1953.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whitehaven", "response": ["*Jackie Sewell (1927\u20132016), footballer"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Jackie Sewell"]}, {"page": "Tommy Lawton", "response": ["He formed a productive forward partnership with Jackie Sewell in the 1948\u201349 campaign, and scored 23 goals in 40 league and cup appearances. County finished in mid-table despite scoring 102 goals, 15 more than champions Swansea. Stollery was sacked and upon Lawton's suggestion the club appointed Eric Houghton as manager after Lawton turned down the role as player-manager. Lawton and Sewell's understanding grew throughout the 1949\u201350 campaign, and Lawton finished as the division's top-scorer with 31 goals in 37 league games as County won promotion as champions, seven points ahead of second-placed Northampton Town. Promotion was secured with a 2\u20130 win over local rivals Nottingham Forest at Meadow Lane on 22 April.", "However he struggled with poor form during the 1950\u201351 season as his first marriage was coming to an end and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 \u2013 breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process \u2013 as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He also found that the well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950\u201351 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951\u201352 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer."]}, {"page": "Ivor Allchurch", "response": ["Allchurch was persuaded to remain at the club, encouraged by Sykes and McCandless' belief in a number of local youth players making their way through the Swans setup, including Cliff Jones, Harry Griffiths and Allchurch's brother Len. In September 1952, Swansea rejected a bid of \u00a330,000 from Arsenal for Allchurch, the bid just \u00a35,000 below the British record transfer fee that Sheffield Wednesday had paid for Jackie Sewell a year previously. He finished the 1952\u201353 season as the club's second highest top scorer with 15 goals, including his first career hattrick during a 3\u20132 victory over Brentford on 6 April 1953.

England were simply unable to obtain the ball, and on the 27th minute Puskas scored again from a deflected J\u00f3zsef Bozsik free-kick. There was a brief rally when Tottenham winger Robb was denied a goal on his debut due to excellent goalkeeping by Grosics, and Mortensen scored for England on 38 minutes.

Despite being the most expensive footballer in British history, Ford continued to work as a car salesman for the Sunderland chairman in his spare time after training to earn extra money. In March 1951, Ford's record transfer fee was broken, following the transfer of Jackie Sewell from Notts County to Sheffield Wednesday for a fee of \u00a334,500. Ford revealed that he was relieved that the record had been broken having described the fee as \"weighing heavy on his shoulders\". During the 1952\u201353 season, the club turned down a bid from Italian side Fiorentina for Ford.

In Taylor\u2019s first full season as manager after the war, Wednesday struggled and narrowly avoided relegation to Division Three North, however he slowly built a team which gained promotion back to Division One in the 1949-50 season. Throughout the 1950s Wednesday became known as a Yo-yo club being promoted or relegated on six occasions under Taylor\u2019s management. Their best period during this time coincided with Taylor\u2019s signing of  Jackie Sewell for a British record transfer fee and the emergence of Derek Dooley as a prolific goalscorer. During this time they were Division Two champions in 1951-52 and then spent three consecutive seasons in Division one, but with little success.
