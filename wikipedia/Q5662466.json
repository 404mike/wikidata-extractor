He captained Somerset from 1960 until his retirement in 1964.\nStephenson is easily the most successful wicket-keeper in history for Somerset, and is the county's only cricketer to have taken 1000 dismissals. He also holds the county record for the most stumpings in a season as well as most catches in a season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club", "response": ["In postwar cricket, the happy-go-lucky Somerset attitude was no longer sustainable, and the side finished bottom of the Championship for four consecutive seasons from 1952. With the strong possibility of going out of business, drastic change was inevitable. Somerset recruited heavily from other countries, taking Colin McCool and Bill Alley from Australia, and from other counties. In 1958, under the captaincy of the first professional cricketer to captain the team, Maurice Tremlett, the side again finished third, and this was repeated in 1963 and 1966 under different captains, Harold Stephenson and Colin Atkinson, who later became headmaster at Millfield School."]}, {"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Harold Stephenson"]}, {"page": "Colin Atkinson", "response": ["Having joined the staff at Millfield, he was approached to join Somerset for the 1960 season, the new captain at Somerset that season being, like Atkinson, a Teessider, Harold Stephenson. In 1960, Atkinson appeared only in the school holidays, and achieved little with the bat, though he took his first five-wicket haul, five for 56, against Kent on the spin-friendly pitch at Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare.

But at the end of the 1948 season, with Luckes now 47, Somerset recruited Harold Stephenson from Durham, and Stephenson took over the wicketkeeping role after a few games of the 1949 season, going on to break Luckes' county record in his first year."]}, {"page": "Ernie Robson", "response": ["He played his final match for Somerset in July 1923, aged 53, opening the bowling in the first-innings and despite his years, he bowled 18 overs.  Rheumatism and the onset of a serious illness made him decide to retire from playing cricket, and he joined the first-class umpires list.  He officiated in his maiden first-class match later in the 1923 season, between Somerset and the touring West Indians.  His health deteriorated, and this was the only match he umpired.  He died in May 1924.  At the time of his last match for Somerset, he had made more appearances for Somerset than any other cricketer, his 424 appearances comfortably placing him ahead of Sammy Woods' 299.  He was later passed by Harold Stephenson (427) and Brian Langford (504).  His 1122 wickets for Somerset were also a club-record, ahead of Ted Tyler's 864, and Jack White, who had 889 wickets at the close of the 1923 season, but went on to surpass Robson's tally, finishing his career with 2165 wickets for Somerset."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2008", "response": ["*Harold Stephenson, 87, British first-class wicketkeeper (Somerset)."]}, {"page": "Stuart Rogers", "response": ["Rogers' own contribution was 1030 Championship runs, 1127 in all matches, including his first century, 101, batting at No 7 against Northamptonshire at Frome.

He was the reserve wicketkeeper to Harold Stephenson at Somerset in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and his first-class cricket career was dictated largely by Stephenson's state of health. So 43 of Eele's 54 first-class matches came in two seasons: 1958, when Stephenson was injured for the second half of the season, and 1964, when Stephenson was able to play only three times. When Stephenson left the county somewhat unwillingly at the end of the 1964 season, Somerset recruited Geoff Clayton of Lancashire as his wicketkeeping replacement. Eele stayed as Clayton's deputy for a couple of seasons, but then left the staff."]}, {"page": "Ken Day (cricketer)", "response": ["An amateur right-handed batsman and a wicketkeeper, Day played in a first-class early-season friendly match for Somerset against Glamorgan in 1950, making 29 not out and 4 in the two innings, and making four stumpings. But with the reliable and normally fit Harold Stephenson as the regular Somerset wicketkeeper, and the county not running, until 1956, a regular second eleven, Day went back into Bristol club cricket, where he was a wicketkeeper and opening batsman for Knowle Cricket Club."]}, {"page": "David Hughes (Somerset cricketer)", "response": ["Hughes was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a wicketkeeper, and his single match for Somerset's first team came about because of the (rare) unavailability of the regular wicketkeeper of the 1950s, Harold Stephenson. In the match against Nottinghamshire at County Ground, Taunton, he took one catch and made one stumping, and contributed two runs to Somerset's second innings after not batting in the first."]}, {"page": "Johnny Lawrence", "response": ["A contributory factor in his bowling success was his understanding with the Somerset wicketkeeper, Harold Stephenson.

The glee on Lawrence's face as an exasperated batsman pounded forward and missed...\""]}, {"page": "Chris Greetham", "response": ["The 1963 season saw Somerset finish third in the County Championship, equalling the highest placing in its history to that point. Greetham was one of six players to pass 1,000 runs for the season, and his final aggregate of 1186 was his best for a single season, with the average of 28.23 runs per innings the highest of his career. Against Leicestershire at Weston-super-Mare, on a wet pitch, he made 141 in three hours; eight Somerset wickets had fallen for 145 when Greetham was joined by Harold Stephenson, the Somerset captain, and the pair put on 183 for the ninth wicket in 105 minutes. The stand remains the ninth wicket record for Somerset: it was equalled, but not surpassed, in 1990 by Chris Tavare and Neil Mallender. With the recruitment of fast bowler Fred Rumsey to Somerset in 1963, there was less bowling for Greetham, but he still took 44 wickets."]}, {"page": "Geoff Lomax", "response": ["The 1955 season saw Somerset recruit a new fast-medium bowler, Bryan Lobb. Lomax's bowling was used less, and he took only 19 wickets at the high cost of 56.47 runs per wicket. As a batsman he was again useful in the late middle order, totalling 892 runs for an average of 21.23; his highest score for the season was just 71. Somerset remained at the bottom of the County Championship table in both of Lomax's first two seasons with the team. Somerset improved to 15th (out of 17) in 1956, but Lomax's performances remained very similar: an aggregate of 960 runs at 19.59 and just 17 wickets at 67.46. His highest score was 99 in the match against Cambridge University, when he put on 177 in 116 minutes for the sixth-wicket with Harold Stephenson, setting a new Somerset record for a sixth wicket partnership in a first-class match. After this match, Lomax was promoted to open the innings for much of the rest of the season, though he moved down the order again in August when the amateur Dennis Silk was available to open."]}, {"page": "Jim Redman (cricketer)", "response": ["Redman played only three more times for Somerset as an amateur, all of them matches at the Bath cricket festival in 1953, and he bowled only 18 overs in these matches, taking just two further wickets. He did have a prominent role in one of the season's memorable matches, though: the game against Lancashire, designated as Bertie Buse's benefit match, was finished inside a single day on a terrible pitch. Somerset's two innings resulted in totals of 55 and 79, and the match lasted up till six o-clock on the first day only because of a second-innings last-wicket stand of 35 between Redman, who made an unbeaten 27 \u2013 the only other double-figure score in the match for Somerset was 14 by Harold Stephenson \u2013 and the 17-year-old Brian Langford. Redman took two wickets in this match but failed in the other two games at Bath, and did not play first-class cricket again."]}, {"page": "Michael Hanna (sportsman)", "response": ["As a cricketer, Hanna was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a wicketkeeper whose opportunities to play county cricket in the 1950s were limited by the presence of Harold Stephenson in the Somerset side. Hanna played one match against Nottinghamshire at Yeovil in 1951: in a rain-affected match, Nottinghamshire made 401 for seven wickets, and Hanna did not take a catch or, when Somerset batted, score a run. His only other first-class match, three years later against Northamptonshire, was no more successful. Northamptonshire made 362 for two wickets and though Somerset avoided being beaten by an innings, the match was lost by 10 wickets. Again Hanna did not take a catch, though this time he made 4 not out in the first innings and a single in the second."]}, {"page": "Geoff Clayton", "response": ["Clayton's arrival at Somerset was itself controversial. Harold Stephenson had been first-choice wicketkeeper since 1949 and captain since 1960, and though he was injured for much of the 1964 season he appears to have expected to continue in both roles. But Somerset's committee offered the captaincy to Colin Atkinson and recruited Clayton as wicketkeeper.", "The move was initially successful. \"Clayton demonstrated that he is among the three or four best keepers in the country,\" Wisden wrote. \"His 85 victims came only one short of the county record held by Harold Stephenson.\" Moreover, in just his fourth match for his new county, against Middlesex at the Imperial Ground, Bristol, he was sent in again as nightwatchman and this time made 106, the only century of his first-class career. The batting of the rest of his Somerset career never reached such heights again, but he was awarded his county cap in his first season and the following year, 1966, with just one fewer dismissal, he was the leading wicketkeeper in the English season."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset first-class cricket records", "response": ["| rowspan=2| 9th || rowspan=2| 183 || Chris Greetham & Harold Stephenson || Leicestershire || Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare || 1963", "| 86 || Harold Stephenson || 1954", "| 83 || Harold Stephenson || 1949", "| 79 || Harold Stephenson || 1962", "| 79 || Harold Stephenson || 1963", "| 1006 || Harold Stephenson", "| 427 || Harold Stephenson || 1948-1964"]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Pakistan in 1955\u201356", "response": ["* Harold Stephenson"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Harold Stephenson (1950\u20131955/56) : H.
