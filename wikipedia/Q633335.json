From the late 1930s, he developed increasingly strident antisemitic views. In 1940, after his involvement with a suspected spy at the United States embassy, he became the only British MP to be interned under Defence Regulation 18B.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Home Guard (United Kingdom)", "response": ["The government's worst fears were briefly thought to have been confirmed on 20 May 1940. Tyler Kent, a cipher clerk in the US embassy spying for the Germans, was apprehended by MI5. Kent had in his possession a locked ledger of 235 names, which was the prewar membership records of the \"Right Club\", an anti-war and anti-Semitic association run by the Conservative MP Archibald Maule Ramsay. None of that was made public at the time, but there was widespread public demand that if the names in the 'Red Book' could be obtained by the Security Services, they should be supplied to local Home Guard units in the event of an invasion. Lord Swinton was ordered by Churchill to determine the true extent of the threat and to propose measures to deal with it. Lord Swinton's immediate response was that internment of British nationals with pro-German sympathies should be greatly extended, and Oswald Mosley and other leaders of the British Union of Fascists were interned on 21 May 1940, with some 700 other suspects."]}, {"page": "Earl of Dalhousie", "response": ["Several other members of the family have also gained distinction. The Hon. George Ramsay (died 1705), younger son of the second Earl, was a lieutenant-general in the Army and served as commander-in-chief of the forces in Scotland in 1702. The aforementioned the Hon. William Ramsay, second son of the eighth Earl, was created Baron Panmure in 1831. The aforementioned the Hon. John Ramsay (1775\u20131842), fourth son of the eighth Earl, was a lieutenant-general in the service of the General Staff of India. He was the father of 1) William Ramsay (1804\u20131871), a major-general in the Bengal Army; 2) the twelfth Earl (see above); 3) James Ramsay (1808\u20131868), a major-general in the Bengal Army; and 4) the Hon. Sir Henry Ramsay (1816\u20131893), a general in the Bengal Army, whose grandson was the politician Archibald Maule Ramsay. The Hon. Charles Ramsay, fourth son of the twelfth Earl, represented Forfar in the House of Commons from 1894 to 1895. The Hon. Sir Patrick Ramsay (1879\u20131962), second son of the thirteenth Earl, was a diplomat and served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece, Hungary and Denmark. The Hon. Sir Alexander Ramsay, third son of the thirteenth Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy and served as Fifth Sea Lord from 1938 to 1939.

The recent rapid seizure of power in Norway by Vidkun Quisling raised the possibility of a fifth column deposing the British government. The fall of the Low Countries and the invasion of France led to fear of invasion. Then on 20 May 1940 a raid on the home of Tyler Kent, a cypher clerk at the U.S. Embassy, revealed that Kent had stolen copies of thousands of telegrams, including those between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. Kent was an associate of Archibald Maule Ramsay, an openly anti-semitic MP. This opened the possibility that Ramsay might use parliamentary privilege to reveal the telegrams, which Churchill had not told the Cabinet about. It would also reveal Roosevelt was trying to help Churchill while proclaiming his support for neutrality in public. The Cabinet decided in favour of widespread detentions of the far right on 22 May. This required an amended version of the Regulation, known as 18B (1A). ", "Archibald Maule Ramsay, the only MP detained, had the matter referred to the House of Commons Committee on Privileges for a ruling as to whether the detention of an MP was a breach of the Privilege of Parliament. The committee decided that it was not."]}, {"page": "Parliamentary privilege", "response": ["* Archibald Maule Ramsay \u2013 treason [1940]"]}]}}
