An amateur, he was the son of Alfred John Reynolds, the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, who owned a company which cut nails. In 1899, at age 25, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and in 1907, he financed the construction of a 30-inch reflecting telescope in Helwan, Egypt, the first large telescope to study objects in the such southerly skies. He also hand-constructed a 28-inch telescope in Harborne. Images from the Reynolds telescope was later used by G\u00e9rard de Vaucouleurs in his system of classifying galaxies; Reynolds also published his own classification for spiral galaxies in 1920. Edwin Hubble frequently corresponded with Reynolds, and some of his findings into the classification of stellar bodies seems at least inspired by his work. The Hubble\u2013Reynolds law, a formula for measuring the surface brightness of elliptical galaxies, is named after them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Reynolds", "response": ["John Reynolds may refer to:", "* John Reynolds (writer) (1588\u20131655), English merchant and writer", "* John Reynolds (died 1966) (1941\u20131966), American actor", "* John Reynolds (actor) (born 1991), American actor and writer", "* John Reynolds (musician), record producer, the first husband of singer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor", "* John Reynolds (Roundhead) (1625\u20131657), soldier in the English Civil War", "* John Reynolds (Royal Navy officer) (1713\u20131788), British naval officer and governor of the Province of Georgia", "* John Reynolds (Dublin politician) (1797\u20131868)", "* John Reynolds (Illinois politician) (1788\u20131865), American politician, governor of Illinois", "* John Reynolds (Canadian politician) (born 1942), Canadian politician from British Columbia", "* John Reynolds (1670\u20131699), Irish Member of Parliament", "* John Reynolds (agriculturist) (1703\u20131779), English farmer and agricultural innovator", "* John Reynolds (astronomer) (1874\u20131949), British astronomer", "* John Reynolds (physicist) (1923\u20132000), American physicist", "* John Reynolds (ecologist) (born 1959), Canadian ecologist", "* John Reynolds (motorcyclist) (born 1963), British motorcycle racer", "* John Reynolds (priest), English Anglican priest", "* John Reynolds Gardiner (1944\u20132006), American author and engineer"]}, {"page": "Helwan", "response": ["* John Reynolds, one of the earliest astronomy specialists in Helwan Observatory & president of the English Royal Astronomical Society between 1935 and 1937."]}, {"page": "John Henry Reynolds (astronomer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Reynolds (astronomer)"]}]}}
