When, after drafting three or four scripts for the proposed Impact, Nathan-Turner informed the pair that plans for the soap had been cancelled, the producer offered them the opportunity to write for Doctor Who as a form of compensation. A scene breakdown (whittled down from six parts to four). was commissioned on 12 July 1983,. but after three months of development on the scripts, during which the story was restructured into two 45-minute episodes, it was ultimately rejected.
