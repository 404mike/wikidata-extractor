In 1841 he travelled to India to become the curator of the museum of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. He set about updating the museum's catalogues, publishing a Catalogue of the Birds of the Asiatic Society in 1849. He was prevented from doing much fieldwork himself, but received and described bird specimens from A.O. Hume, Samuel Tickell, Robert Swinhoe and others. \nHe remained as curator until 1862, when ill-health forced his return to England. His Natural History of the Cranes was published posthumously in 1881.Avian species bearing his name include Blyth's hornbill, Blyth's leaf warbler, Blyth's hawk-eagle, Blyth's olive bulbul, Blyth's parakeet, Blyth's frogmouth, Blyth's reed warbler, Blyth's rosefinch, Blyth's shrike-babbler, Blyth's tragopan, Blyth's pipit and Blyth's kingfisher. Reptilian species and a genus bearing his name include Blythia reticulata, Eumeces blythianus, and Rhinophis blythii.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Russel Wallace", "response": ["The paper shook Charles Lyell's belief that species were immutable. Although his friend Charles Darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did Edward Blyth who thought it \"Good! Upon the whole!\u00a0... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into species.\" Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the progressive creationism of the time and wrote that it was \"nothing very new\u00a0... Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him.\" Lyell was more impressed and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend Joseph Hooker and now, for the first time, he spelt out the full details of natural selection to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, then began writing up a species sketch of his continuing work in May 1856.Desmond & Moore Darwin 1991, p. 438;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Browne Charles Darwin: Voyaging pp. 537\u201346."]}, {"page": "Natural selection", "response": ["Between 1835 and 1837, the zoologist Edward Blyth worked on the area of variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature.

Gray erected the family Aegithinidae in 1869 he included a number of babbler genera in it with the ioras.
