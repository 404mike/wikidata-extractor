In early August 1944, Major General George Erskine, the division's GOC, who had been in command of the division since January 1943, Brigadier William Hinde, commanding the 22nd Armoured Brigade, and up to 100 other officers of the division were removed from their positions and reassigned. Erskine was replaced by Major General Gerald Lloyd-Verney. Historians largely agree that this was a consequence of the \"failure\" at Villers-Bocage and had been planned since that battle.Fortin, p. 10Forty, p. 104Taylor, p. 84Wilmot, p. 398 Historian Daniel Taylor is of the opinion that the battle's result provided an excuse and that the sackings took place to \"demonstrate that the army command was doing something to counteract the poor public opinion of the conduct of the campaign\". Historian and former British Army officer Mungo Melvin has commented approvingly of the 7th Armoured Division's institution of a flexible combined arms structure, which other British armoured divisions did not adopt until after Operation Goodwood.Buckley (2006), pp. 28\u201329", "|Major-General Gerald Lloyd-Verney"]}, {"page": "Page of Honour", "response": ["*1914\u20131917: Gerald Lloyd-Verney"]}, {"page": "Miles Dempsey", "response": ["On 2 August, Dempsey told Montgomery that he was fed up with Bucknall, the XXX Corps commander, and Major-General George Erskine, the commander of the 7th Armoured Division, and wanted to relieve them both. Relief of a corps commander is always a sensitive matter, and Bucknall had been appointed at Montgomery's request despite Brooke's reservations. Montgomery now had to admit to Brooke that he had made a mistake, and that Bucknall was not fit to command a corps in mobile operations after all. Bucknall was replaced by Horrocks. Erskine was also replaced, in his case by Major-General Gerald Lloyd-Verney. This meant that all four British corps commanders in the 21st Army Group had commanded a corps before Dempsey had, but Horrocks (XXX Corps) and John Crocker (I Corps) had been wounded, Richard O'Connor (VIII Corps) had been a prisoner of war, and Neil Ritchie had been sacked as Eighth Army commander after losing the Battle of Gazala in June 1942."]}, {"page": "56th (London) Infantry Division", "response": ["|Major-General Gerald Lloyd-Verney"]}, {"page": "1st Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* Brigadier Gerald Lloyd-Verney (from 11 March 1945)"]}, {"page": "Verney baronets", "response": ["Several other members of the Verney family have also gained distinction.

The citation for these awards emphasised his command of the battalion during the liberation of Ghent, when the battalion was the leading element of the 7th Armoured Division.

Shortly afterwards, in the difficult bocage country during Operation Bluecoat, the 7th Armoured Division failed to gain its objectives and Erskine was sacked and replaced by Gerald Lloyd-Verney. In spite of his indifferent performance as a field commander Erskine had qualities which suited him to other roles and this episode proved only a temporary setback to his career.

The division was a much-changed formation to the one which had fought in the Western Desert, and now consisted of the 22nd Armoured and 131st Infantry Brigades and had gone through changes of command. Lyne did not see his first action as an armoured commander, however, until mid-January 1945, when, serving under Lieutenant-General Ritchie's XII Corps, it fought in Operation Blackcock, the attempt to clear the Roer triangle. The operation was successful, with the division managing to seize their objective, despite the frozen ground, with relatively light casualties. The division remained in its positions until relieved in late February."]}, {"page": "Harry Lloyd Verney", "response": ["He married Lady Joan Elizabeth Mary Cuffe (1877\u20131951), daughter of Hamilton Cuffe, 5th Earl of Desart and Lady Margaret Joan Lascelles (a daughter of Henry Lascelles, 4th Earl of Harewood), on 6 June 1889.
