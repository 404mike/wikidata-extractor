Elizabeth Price left toward the end of the year to form The Carousel with Razorcuts frontman Gregory Webster, and so the single, released on 30 May 1987, was the first to feature replacement Eithne Farry (vocals, tambourine). The single was less shambolic than their earlier offerings, and a video was made for it which was played on The Chart Show (then shown on Channel 4), giving the band some mainstream exposure. The single was produced (some critics suggested it was over-produced) by John Rivers, as was the follow-up \"Bringing Up Baby\", a sophisticated pop song that reduced the band's \"shambling\" element to the point where mainstream success seemed a possibility. Indeed, The Primitives would later take precisely this route to success \u2013 but Talulah Gosh never made the national chart. The ironically-titled debut (compilation) album Rock Legends: Volume 69 was released in October 1987, collecting tracks from the earlier singles and radio sessions.", "After the split, Peter joined The Razorcuts, while Amelia issued a one-off solo single, \"Can You Keep a Secret?\".  Amelia and Mathew Fletcher and Peter Momtchiloff regrouped as Heavenly in late 1989, with Talulah Gosh co-founder Rob Pursey also returning to the fold.
