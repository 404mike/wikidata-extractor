His book Percussion Instruments and their History (1971) is a standard reference work on the subject.Blades was born in Peterborough in 1901. He was a long-time associate of Benjamin Britten, with whom he conceived many of the composer's unusual percussion effects. In 1954, Blades was appointed Professor of Percussion at the Royal Academy of Music.As a chamber musician he played with the Melos Ensemble and the English Chamber Orchestra.Blades' pupils included the rock drummers Max Sedgley, Carl Palmer and Richard James Burgess as well as the percussionist Evelyn Glennie.His most famous and widely heard performances were the sound of the drum playing \"V-for-Victory\" in Morse code, the introduction to the BBC broadcasts made to the European Resistance during World War II, and providing the sound of the gong seen at the start of films produced by the Rank Organisation. Blades played this sound on a tam-tam. On screen Blades's sound was mimed to by the \"Gongman\".\nHis autobiography Drum Roll: A Professional Adventure from the Circus to the Concert Hall was published by Faber & Faber in 1977.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Percussion instrument", "response": ["*James Blades, Percussion Instruments and Their History, (1970)."]}, {"page": "1901", "response": ["* September 9 \u2013 James Blades, English percussionist (d. 1999)"]}, {"page": "Cheam", "response": ["*James Blades (1901\u20131999) orchestral percussionist."]}, {"page": "Triangle (musical instrument)", "response": ["The triangle is often the subject of jokes and one-liners, as an archetypal instrument that seemingly has no musical function and requires no skill to play (the Martin Short character Ed Grimley is an example).

(James Blades, \"Percussion Instruments and their History\" 1992) The rute were played by the bass drum player, with a mallet striking on downbeats and rute being struck on offbeats. A typical pattern in this style would generally go, in 4/4 time, boom-tap-tap-tap boom-tap-tap-tap, the taps representing strikes of the rute. Mozart's contemporaries and immediate successors used the rute in a similar fashion for military effect. Mahler's use of the rute in the third movement of the Symphony No. 2 broke completely with traditional military writing for the instrument, focusing more on its coloristic possibilities than on the rhythmic role. This application was continued by Edgard Varese in his coloristic use of percussion."]}, {"page": "1999 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 19 May \u2013 James Blades, orchestral percussionist (born 1901)"]}, {"page": "1901 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 9 September \u2013 James Blades, orchestral percussionist (died 1999)"]}, {"page": "Max Sedgley", "response": ["Sedgley was educated at Dulwich College, a boarding independent school for boys in Dulwich, in South London.
