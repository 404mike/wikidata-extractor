In later life he was a farmer and magistrate.\nThe son of Thomas Hallowes Vaughan and Elsie Vaughan, he was born in Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa, Mexico. He was educated at Repton School, where his house and headmaster was the future Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher.Vaughan proceeded to Clare College, Cambridge, where he gained a Cambridge Blue in football for three consecutive years. He captained the University football team during this time. He made his first-class debut for Cambridge University against Leicestershire in 1928. In this match, he was dismissed for 3 runs in the Cambridge first innings by Ewart Astill; he was not required to bat in their second innings. He played a second and final first-class match for the University in the same season, against Sussex, where he was dismissed for a duck by Arthur Gilligan in the University first innings. In their second innings, he scored 13 runs before being dismissed by Maurice Tate.He made his debut for Berkshire in the 1928 Minor Counties Championship against Wiltshire. He appeared in three further matches for Berkshire in 1930, the last coming against Oxfordshire. He later joined Wiltshire in 1937, appearing again for the county in 1939 and after World War II, playing Minor counties cricket for Wiltshire until 1951 and making 16 appearances.Outside cricket, Vaughan worked for Shell in Ceylon during the early 1930s. Returning from there, he took up farming in 1935, buying Middle Farm in Winterbourne Monkton, Wiltshire. He married to Blanche Innes Dickson in 1937, the couple having three children, their daughter Sarah Merion Vaughan being bestowed an OBE.He served in World War II with the Royal Army Service Corps, obtaining the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in 1940. He was later promoted to a full Lieutenant and in March 1941 to a Temporary Captain. The Service Corp was later attached to the 18th Infantry Division, arriving in Singapore three weeks before the Japanese invasion, which ended in a British surrender. He spent time following the surrender as a prisoner of war in Changi Prison, before being sent to work on the Burma Railway, working there for eight months. During his internment he came across his brother-in-law John Austin Dickson, and they helped each other through their captivity. His experiences during the war were rarely mentioned by him in later life.Following the war, he resumed farming in Wiltshire. He also served as a J.P., and as Chairman of the local branches of the National Farmers Union and Conservative Party. He gave up farming in 1963 following a series of heart attacks, later dying in Woodborough, Wiltshire on 1 April 1966. His wife died 41 years later in 2007.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Vaughan", "response": ["Richard Vaughan may refer to:", "* Richard Vaughan (of Corsygedol) (died 1636), Welsh MP for Merioneth in 1628", "* Richard Vaughan, 2nd Earl of Carbery (died 1686), Welsh soldier, peer and politician", "* Richard Vaughan (judge) (c. 1655\u20131724), Member of Parliament (MP) for Carmarthen", "* Richard Vaughan (MP for Bristol), see Bristol", "* Richard Vaughan (died 1734) (c. 1665\u20131734), Welsh politician", "* Richard Vaughan (badminton) (born 1978), British badminton player", "* Richard Vaughan (cricketer) (1908\u20131966), English cricketer", "* Richard Vaughan (ice hockey), American college ice hockey coach", "* Richard Vaughan (bishop) (1550\u20131607), bishop of Chester, 1597\u20131604", "* Richard Vaughan (robotics) (born 1971), British researcher based in Canada", "* Richard Vaughan, British film and news narrator noted for episodes on Seconds From Disaster"]}, {"page": "List of Cambridge University Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Richard Vaughan (1928) : R.
