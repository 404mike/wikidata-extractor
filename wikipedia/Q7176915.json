As a player, he made more than 500 appearances in the Football League playing as a central defender for Sheffield Wednesday, Charlton Athletic, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Barnsley and Carlisle United. He has managed Mansfield Town, and is currently employed as first-team coach at Swindon Town.Shirtliff was born in Hoyland, near Barnsley. He began his football career with Sheffield Wednesday, where in two spells with the club he achieved promotion from the Second Divisionin 1983\u201384, a third-place finish in the First Division in the 1991\u201392 season, and a League Cup-winners' medal in 1991, but missed the 1993 League Cup and FA Cup finals with a broken arm. He played more than 350 games for the club in all competitions. After his first spell with Wednesday, he joined Charlton Athletic, where his two goals in the last 10 minutes of extra time in the 1986\u201387 playoff final replay against Leeds kept the club in the First Division. He also played for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Barnsley and Carlisle United).Shirtliff retired from the game in 1997, shortly after helping Barnsley reach the Premier League, after 18 years as a professional footballer. He has since been youth team coach at Barnsley and Leicester City. In 2005, he was appointed assistant manager at Mansfield Town. He became the manager of Mansfield following the dismissal of Carlton Palmer in September 2005, and lasted 15 months in the job before getting sacked in December 2006 following a poor run of results.In 2007, he was appointed assistant manager at Tranmere Rovers, and two years later took up the equivalent post at Swindon Town. He was also assistant manager and caretaker manager of Bury before departing in 2013.\nHis younger brother Paul was also a professional footballer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["As the 1980\u201381 season came around Wednesday had young talent such as Mark Smith, Kevin Taylor, Peter Shirtliff and Mel Sterland breaking into the first team.

Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (\u00a315,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free transfer from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (\u00a335,000 from Doncaster Rovers, having also signed him whilst at Doncaster). Aiming for a promotion push in the 1986\u201387 campaign, Leeds were stuck in mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for \u00a3840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for \u00a3110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for \u00a372,000 and \u00a3200,000 respectively. A 2\u20131 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs by the end of the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3\u20132 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1\u20130 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew's.

An appeal was made to the FA following his third dismissal, during a 2\u20130 home win over Millwall on 24 March 2007. However manager Martin Foyle admitted \"every time I have gone to the Football Association with an appeal I do not seem to get anything.\" The Millwall match was to prove Talbot's last of the season, though he was retained upon its conclusion. The \"tenacious tackling defender\" was a regular during the 2007\u201308 season, though he fell out the club's first team plans under new manager Lee Sinnott, Talbot knew by January 2008 he had no future at Vale."]}]}}
