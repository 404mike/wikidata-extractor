Ray Goetz at the instigation of Goetz's wife and the show's star, Ir\u00e8ne Bordoni. She had wanted Rodgers and Hart to write the songs, but they were unavailable, and Porter's agent persuaded Goetz to hire Porter instead.Citron (2005), p. 73 In August 1928, Porter's work on the show was interrupted by the death of his father. He hurried back to Indiana to comfort his mother before returning to work. The songs for the show included \"Let's Misbehave\" and one of his best-known list songs, \"Let's Do It\", which was introduced by Bordoni and Arthur Margetson.Kimball (1984), pp. 101 and 104 The show opened on Broadway on October 8, 1928. The Porters did not attend the first night because Porter was in Paris supervising another show for which he had been commissioned, La Revue, at a nightclub.Citron (2005), pp. 74 and 79 This was also a success, and, in Citron's phrase, Porter was finally \"accepted into the upper echelon of Broadway songwriters\".Citron (2005), p. 78 Cochran now wanted more from Porter than isolated extra songs; he planned a West End extravaganza similar to Ziegfeld's shows, with a Porter score and a large international cast led by Jessie Matthews, Sonnie Hale and Tilly Losch. The revue, Wake Up and Dream, ran for 263 performances in London, after which Cochran transferred it to New York in 1929. On Broadway, business was badly affected by the 1929 Wall Street crash, and the production ran for only 136 performances. From Porter's point of view, it was nonetheless a success, as his song \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" became immensely popular.Citron (2005), pp 80\u201382"]}, {"page": "Random Harvest (film)", "response": ["*Arthur Margetson as Chetwynd Rainier"]}, {"page": "1928 in music", "response": ["* \"Let's Do It\" w.m.
