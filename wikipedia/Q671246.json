In April 1918 he was arrested for sedition, and his 75-minute speech from the dock became a celebrated text for Scottish left-wingers. He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude, but was released after the November armistice.\nMaclean believed that Scottish workers were especially fitted to lead the revolution, and talked of \"Celtic communism\", inspired by clan spirit. But his launch of a Scottish Workers Republican Party and a Scottish Communist Party were largely unsuccessful. Although he had been appointed Bolshevik representative in Scotland, he was not in harmony with the Communist Party of Great Britain, even though it had absorbed the British Socialist Party, to which he had belonged. In captivity, Maclean had been on hunger strike, and prolonged force-feeding had permanently affected his health. He collapsed during a speech and died of pneumonia, aged forty-four.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 30", "response": ["*1923 \u2013 John Maclean, Scottish educator and activist (b. 1879)"]}, {"page": "Political prisoner", "response": ["* John Maclean was imprisoned by the British government for his opposition to the First World War."]}, {"page": "Sorley MacLean", "response": ["MacLean once said that various Communist figures meant more to him than any poet, writing to Douglas Young in 1941 that \"Lenin, Stalin and Dimitroff now mean more to me than Prometheus and Shelley did in my teens\".

Many of these figures were not Gaels, and some critics have noted MacLean's unusual generosity to non-Gaelic people in his work.

Under the leadership of Mary Barbour, Mary Laird, Helen Crawfurd, Mary Jeff and Jessie Stephen the Glasgow Women's Housing Association became the driving force behind the rent strike that started in May 1915 in the industrialised area of Govan. Tenants refused to pay the latest increase in rents and staged mass demonstrations against evictions, resulting in violent confrontations. With the start of the First World War local young men left Glasgow to serve in the army overseas, and the first violent protest in the Govan district took place in April to resist the eviction of a soldier's family.
