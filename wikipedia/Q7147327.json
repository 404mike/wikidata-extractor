He was also made a Steward of The British Boxing Board of Control.\nAfter the 1987 General Election, Nicholls entered the government as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Employment. Still not yet 40, he was given a key role in piloting the second tranche of Conservative Trades Union reforms through Standing Committee. His upward advance was checked, however, when he was arrested for drink driving in 1990, as a result of which he resigned from the government.\nNicholls\u2019 career was, however, only temporarily stalled. He was appointed to the Westminster Foundation for Democracy at its inception in 1992 and served on The North Atlantic Assembly and the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs. In 1994, he was made a Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party and in 1997 was appointed the Shadow Fisheries Minister by the then Leader of the Opposition, William Hague. A leading Eurosceptic, Nicholls was credited with having single-handedly turned Conservative Party policy around in favour of leaving the EU Common Fisheries Policy.\nAfter losing his seat in 2001, Nicholls became Chairman of The Young Britons Foundation, a  research think-tank established in July 2003 to \"help train tomorrow's centre-right leaders and activists today\". Currently, Nicholls is a freelance political journalist and lectures on British and American politics in Europe and America as well as the UK.\nNicholls is married with three children. His wife, Bridget, is also a solicitor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Patrick Nicholls"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Patrick Nicholls"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Patrick Nicholls"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Patrick Nicholls"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Patrick Nicholls"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Patrick Nicholls"]}, {"page": "Patrick Charles Martyn Nicholls", "response": ["#redirect Patrick Nicholls"]}, {"page": "List of ministers under Margaret Thatcher", "response": ["!scope=row|Patrick Nicholls", "!scope=row|Patrick Nicholls"]}, {"page": "Teignbridge (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The seat was held by Patrick Nicholls of the Conservative Party from its creation until his defeat by Richard Younger-Ross of the Liberal Democrats at the 2001 general election.
