As the daughter of genre and portrait painter, Thomas Musgrave Joy, she was particularly known for her art and literature. In her early life, she mainly focused on painting, drawing, and illustrating. Her artwork can be seen featured in her husband's works. However, after marriage, she became thoroughly versed in literature and history. She both wrote and designed the covers of her own books. Some of her published works include Chaucer for Children (1877), Chaucer for Schools (1881), The Art of Beauty (1878), The Art of Dress (1879), The Art of Decoration (1881), and The Art of Housekeeping (1889), Beautiful Houses (1882), A Flame of Fire (1897). The genres of her work include journalism, politics, philosophy, essays, and fiction novels. She also left many printed articles and papers in manuscript on various subjects. As one of the most brilliant and gifted women of her time, she naturally became a celebrity in literature and art.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philippa Roet", "response": ["It is probable that Chaucer and Philippa had \"two sons and two daughters\", whose birthdates are unknown. A lurid conspiracy theory was put forth, first by Mary Eliza Haweis in the late nineteenth-century, and then again more influentially by Russell Kraus in 1932, that \"one or two\" of these children had been illicitly fathered by John of Gaunt. Many scholars, including almost all contemporary Chaucerians have argued against this theory; H.A. Kelly, for example, has effectively demonstrated that this belief is likely false as John of Gaunt having sexual relations with two sisters would have been considered incest and would have required additional papal dispensation for him to marry Katherine. Samantha Katz Seal argues that literary critics deliberately encouraged the idea of a \"harlot\" Philippa for the same reason that earlier critics had believed in a \"shrewish\" Philippa, namely that alienating Chaucer from his wife and domestic circles allowed these critics to imagine a more masculine Chaucer, and to claim that they, his critics, understood Chaucer better than anyone else ever had, especially his wife."]}, {"page": "Mina Loy", "response": ["Around the age of eighteen, Loy convinced her parents to allow her to continue her education in Paris with a chaperone \u2013 a woman called Mrs Knight. After much persuasion, she was allowed to move to Montparnasse, which in 1902 had not yet been urbanised, and attend the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi as an art student. Unlike the segregated classes at the Munich K\u00fcnstlerinnenverein, these art classes were mixed. It was here, through an English friend of a similar social standing named Madeline Boles, that Loy first came into contact with the English painter Stephen Haweis who Loy later described as enacting the \"parasitic drawing-out of one's vitality to recharge, as it were, his own deficient battery of life.\" According to Burke's biography, Haweis was unpopular with his fellow students, being considered a \"poseur,\" and Boles in particular took him under her wing. Haweis, whose father was the well-known Reverend H.R. Haweis and his mother Mary Eliza Haweis a writer who wrote, amongst other things, Chaucer for Children: A Golden Key, was an aesthete of sorts and \"despite being very short[,] he managed to condescend to his listeners from a height.\" He began to exert himself over Loy, recognising her beauty and desirability, and played the role of the misunderstood eccentric which led Loy to feel guilty for disliking him and distrusting him as he borrowed more and more money from her without paying her back. Later she would reflect that Haweis loomed over her and she became, in Loy's own words, \"as sullenly involved as with my mother's sadistic hysterics.\" One night he convinced her to stay over and, in what she would later describe as a state of hypnosis, she was seduced by him. Waking up next morning in his bed, semi-naked, Loy was horrified and repulsed."]}, {"page": "Victorian dress reform", "response": ["In the 1870s, a largely English movement led by Mary Eliza Haweis sought dress reform to enhance and celebrate the natural shape of the body, preferring the looser lines of the medieval and renaissance eras.  A historic nostalgia for more forgiving fashions, the aesthetic dress movement critiqued fashionable dress for its immovable shapes, and sought the \u2018fashioning and adorning of a robe\u2019 as tastefully complementary to the natural body.Dress and Morality by Aileen Ribeiro, (Homes and Meier Publishers Inc: New York. 1986): 139"]}, {"page": "Hugh Reginald Haweis", "response": ["Hugh Reginald Haweis (3 April 1838 \u2013 29 January 1901) was an English cleric and writer.
