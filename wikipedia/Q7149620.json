He was also a founder member of the London Musicians Collective, holding membership card no 1, and wrote for the magazine Musics among others. Paul was also a member of the Resisters. The Resisters played gigs in London and Germany in the late 1970s.\nDuring the 1980s he formed the industrial performance group Bow Gamelan Ensemble with Anne Bean and Richard Wilson.\nIn 2000, Burwell moved into the old Kingston Rowing Club in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, turning it into an experimental art space for both local and nationally recognised artists and musicians. Few recordings of his work exist; his work was primarily live and acoustic.\nTwo 7 inch singles, featuring \"Low Flying Aircraft\" and \"When I Grow Rich\", and an album by the Bow Gamelan were released. He also featured in David Toop's Sonic Boom booklet from the Hayward Gallery in 2001, and on Richard Wilson's Turbine Hall Swimming Pool performance album.\nHe was featured in William Raban's film, Beating the Bridges.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ruislip", "response": ["* Experimental musician Paul Burwell (1949\u20132007) was born in Ruislip."]}, {"page": "Incus Records", "response": ["|, Paul Burwell, Hugh Davies, Max Eastley, Paul Lovens, Paul Lytton, Annabel Nicolson, Evan Parker"]}, {"page": "Bob Cobbing", "response": ["Cobbing also explored his interest in performance works for multiple voices and musical instruments in groups like abAna (a trio with Paul Burwell and David Toop, and sextet with the addition of Lyn Conetta, Herman Hauge and Christopher Small), Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle, which included poets Paula Claire and Bill Griffiths and musician Michael Chant.

Instead of letting your stick free rebound, you can mute it, slide it on there. It calls for greater physicality.\" Graves told Aakash Mittal: \"when I play, I do more than vertical strokes. I\u2019m not just bah-bop bah-bop. My thing is moving around, touching the skins, knowing about momentum and position at the same time.\" In an interview with Paul Burwell, Graves stated: \"I relate the drum skin to a body of water... As a musician, you are schooling yourself to deal with some of the most sensitive things in the universe: emotion, frequency, life, the vital force... we're involved with one of the most subtle things in life.
