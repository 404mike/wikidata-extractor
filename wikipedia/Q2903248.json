Recognising a lack of expressive flexibility in the language (described in his essay \"At the Limit of Fertile Land...\"),Boulez (1991), 162. Boulez loosened the strictness of total serialism into a more supple and strongly gestural music: \"I am trying to rid myself of my thumbprints and taboos\", he wrote to Cage.Campbell, 13. The most significant result of this new freedom was Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre (1953\u20131955), described by Griffiths and Bill Hopkins as a \"keystone of twentieth-century music\". Three short poems by Char form the starting-point for three interlocking cycles. Four movements are vocal settings of the poems (one is set twice), the other five are instrumental commentaries. According to Hopkins and Griffiths the music is characterised by abrupt tempo transitions, passages of broadly improvisatory melodic style and exotic instrumental colouring. The piece is scored for contralto soloist with alto flute, xylorimba, vibraphone, percussion, guitar and viola. Boulez said that the choice of these instruments showed the influence of non-European cultures, to which he had always been attracted.Boulez (1976), 67."]}, {"page": "Serialism", "response": ["*Bill Hopkins"]}, {"page": "Jean Barraqu\u00e9", "response": ["Barraqu\u00e9 wrote many articles on other composers (including Alban Berg, Monteverdi, Mozart and Messiaen) and on theoretical aspects of contemporary music.
