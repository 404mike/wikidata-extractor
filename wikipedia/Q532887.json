The three \u2014Se\u00e1n Savage, Daniel McCann, and Mair\u00e9ad Farrell who were members of Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade \u2014 were believed to be mounting a car bomb attack on British military personnel in Gibraltar. Plain-clothed SAS soldiers approached them in the forecourt of a petrol station, then opened fire, killing them. All three were found to be unarmed, and no bomb was discovered in Savage's car, leading to accusations that the British government had conspired to murder them. An inquest in Gibraltar ruled that the SAS had acted lawfully, while the European Court of Human Rights held that, although there had been no conspiracy, the planning and control of the operation was so flawed as to make the use of lethal force almost inevitable. The deaths were the first in a chain of violent events in a fourteen-day period. On 16 March, the funeral of the three IRA members was attacked by a loyalist wielding pistols and grenades, leaving three mourners dead. Then, at the funeral of one of the mourners, the IRA shot two plain clothed British soldiers who had driven into the procession in error.", "The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) aimed to establish a united Ireland and end the British administration of Northern Ireland through the use of force. The organisation was the result of a 1969 split in the Irish Republican Army;Bishop & Mallie, pp. 136\u2013138. the other group, the Marxist-Lenininist Official IRA, ceased military activity in the 1970s. The IRA killed civilians, members of the armed forces, police, judiciary and prison service, including off-duty and retired members, and bombed businesses and military targets in both Northern Ireland and England, with the aim of making Northern Ireland ungovernable.Coogan, pp. 375\u2013376, 379.O'Leary, pp. 210\u2013211. Daniel McCann, Se\u00e1n Savage, and Mair\u00e9ad Farrell were, according to journalist Brendan O'Brien, \"three of the IRA's most senior activists\". Savage was an explosives expert and McCann was \"a high-ranking intelligence operative\"; both McCann and Farrell had previously served prison sentences for offences relating to explosives.O'Brien, p. 151.Crawshaw & Holmstr\u00f6m, p. 88.English, p. 257.", "In the weeks after the resumption of the changing of the guard ceremony, the three IRA members who were to carry out the attack\u2014Se\u00e1n Savage, Daniel McCann, and Mair\u00e9ad Farrell\u2014travelled to M\u00e1laga ( along the coast from Gibraltar), where they each rented a car.Eckert, p. 63. Their activities were monitored and by early March, the British authorities were convinced that an IRA attack was imminent; a special projects team from the SAS was despatched to the territory, apparently with the personal approval of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.Eckert, pp. 67\u201368. Before the operation, the SAS practised arrest techniques, while the Gibraltar authorities searched for a suitable place to hold the would-be bombers after their arrest.Punch, p. 15. The plan was that the SAS would assist the Gibraltar Police in arresting the IRA members\u2014identified by MI5 officers who had been in Gibraltar for several weeks\u2014if they were seen parking a car in Gibraltar and then attempting to leave the territory.Eckert, p. 70.", "The IRA notified the McCann, Savage, and Farrell families of the deaths on the evening of 6 March.Eckert, p. 86. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of Sinn F\u00e9in, was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mair\u00e9ad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast.Eckert, pp. 89\u201391. At the Northern Ireland border, the Northern Irish authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between police and members of the procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse.Eckert, p. 93.
