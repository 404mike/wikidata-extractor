He appeared in Crackerjack! with Eamonn Andrews and Leslie Crowther in the 1960s, and with Michael Aspel, Don Maclean and Bernie Clifton in the 1970s. In Crackerjack! sketches, he usually played a pompous or middle-class character, who would always get exasperated with his partner Don Maclean during the course of the sketch. Maclean would then give an alliterative reply, such as \"Don't get your knickers in a knot\" or \"Don't get your tights in a twist\". He regularly uttered the expression \"D'oh!\", originated by James Finlayson in Laurel and Hardy films, long before it became associated with cartoon character Homer Simpson. He was also on the panel of the long-running radio panel game Twenty Questions, along with Joy Adamson, Anona Winn and Norman Hackforth.\nGlaze was the son of an actor-manager and started in entertainment as a comedian at the Windmill Theatre in 1946. He was The Crazy Gang's understudy and appeared in the 1981 musical Underneath the Arches, alongside Roy Hudd and Christopher Timothy as Flanagan and Allen; he assisted Hudd in a recreation of one of the Gang's famous routines for a televised Royal Variety Performance in 1982. He also appeared in Whack-O! (1958); as the villainous City Administrator in the Doctor Who serial The Sensorites (1964); and in The Sweeney episode \"Big Spender\" (1975) as Joe Spratt.
