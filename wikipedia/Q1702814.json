The final show of the 2008 Best of tour on 22 April would be presented by Rob Brydon. Following Lyttelton's death there was speculation that the series might be cancelled because replacing him would be extremely difficult if not impossible. In a eulogy in The Guardian, Barry Cryer did not allude to the future of the programme but said that there's \"got to be an agonising reappraisal\" and that Lyttelton was the \"very hub of the show\". Cryer, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden all ruled themselves out as hosts: Cryer did not think the programme would work if a panellist became chairman and it \"would need somebody of stature to be parachuted in\". Jeremy Hardy also ruled himself out, saying \"Humph had big shoes to fill and I wouldn't do it.\"", "*Jon Naismith (1991\u2013present)", "Lyttelton would describe Samantha's social activities, usually in an apology received from the unseen character who had been detained, often with a \"gentleman friend\". His comments included sexual innuendo and double entendres, like \"Samantha likes nothing better than a little potter in the woodshed in the morning\", though many were far more daring and explicit. During early episodes of Samantha's appearance on the show, it was not completely clear that she was a fictional character, garnering complaints about the sexist and humiliating treatment she received. Producer Jon Naismith recalled \"when we [Naismith and Iain Pattinson] took over the show we used to get quite a few letters accusing us of sexist references to Samantha\"Roberts, Jem.
