He took first at the Seven Sisters trail marathons in 1983 and 1985 after winning the Fleet Half Marathon in 1982 in 1:05:32. Later, he was the top finisher at the inaugural Paddock Wood Half Marathon. But on the marathon majors stage, he made his biggest statement behind fellow Brits Hugh Jones, Mike Gratton, and Don Faircloth when he finished 14th in the 1982 London Marathon in 2:16:16. His gritty running style and his victories lead him to became one of the best known athletes from the Hastings Athletic Club."]}]}}
