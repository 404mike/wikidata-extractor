He played more than 100 league games for Bradford during five years in the first team. Colbeck nearly left Bradford in 2007 when he was made available for transfer and played six games on loan for Darlington. However, he returned following his loan spell and went on to win Bradford City's player of the season award during the 2007\u201308 campaign. He turned down a new deal a year later and joined Oldham Athletic on transfer deadline day in September 2009 to rejoin manager Dave Penney, for whom he played at Darlington. When Penney was sacked after less than a year in charge, Colbeck also soon left and joined Hereford United before spending several years with Grimsby Town and moving to Harrogate Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bradford City A.F.C.", "response": ["|2007\u201308|| Joe ColbeckBradford City official website\u00a0\u2013 Joe Colbeck profile  "]}, {"page": "Nicky Law (footballer, born 1988)", "response": ["In October 2008, Law was again signed on loan at Bradford City, as cover for Joe Colbeck, who was injured in a victory against Grimsby Town.

However, when Colbeck was available again, Nix was dropped to the substitutes' bench, with new signing Paul McLaren partnering Lee Bullock, who had returned from injury, in central midfield. Nix struggled for form but was also playing with an ankle injury, which eventually forced him to take a hospital scan in November. He was one of six club midfielders to be injured at the time. He returned to action later that month as a second-half substitute against his father's former team Rotherham United, at the Don Valley Stadium. However, he struggled to hold down a regularly place in the side because of new midfielders signed during the course of the season, and he was released at the end of the campaign having played less than half the games that he played in his first year at City. Nix was offered the chance to return to Bradford by McCall if he could not find a new club but he rejected the invitation.", "Nix spent two weeks of summer on holiday in Mexico with three former Bradford colleagues, Joe Colbeck, Dean Furman and Nicky Law. Although Nix had reported interest from League Two clubs, upon his return from holiday he dropped down a division to go on trial with Conference National club Mansfield Town. After just three days of his trial he signed a two-year deal to become their 11th\u00a0new player of the summer. Nix made his debut for Mansfield in their opening day 4\u20130 victory against Crawley Town, and scored his first goal for his new club at the end of September during a 3\u20131 defeat to Barrow. Nix enjoyed a run of games in the first team and was described by manager David Holdsworth as one of the club's \"best players\" until he suffered an ankle injury, which required surgery at a hospital in Northallerton and kept him out of first-team action until the new year. He returned to playing action for Mansfield reserves in late January and was back in the first team squad by the end of the month. He made his comeback to the first team in a 3\u20131 defeat to Stevenage Borough at the start of February. By the end of his first season with Mansfield, he had played 23 league games and scored twice."]}, {"page": "Bradford derby", "response": ["|Joe Colbeck"]}, {"page": "Colbeck", "response": ["*Joe Colbeck (born 1986), English athlete in football"]}]}}
