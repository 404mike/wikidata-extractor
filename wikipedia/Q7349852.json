Both teams had uniforms of similar colours: blue and white, but Rovers allowed Everton to wear their normal colours and came out in red and black jerseys. The match started at a frantic pace but neither side was particularly threatened. However, at one point Everton's right side struggled to cope with the Rovers' attack and Rovers exploited this to score. At half-time the score was 1\u20130 to Blackburn Rovers. In the second half, Everton had the sun behind them and started more aggressively. Everton's goalkeeper Robert Smalley had to make a good save to prevent Rovers scoring, but with the wind at their backs, Everton's play became flat and Rovers took full advantage scoring twice more, with the match finishing 3\u20130 to Blackburn Rovers."]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["Having finished the previous season as runners up Everton made just one signing of note during the summer when William Campbell was brought from Bootle to fill the centre half role, which had remained unsettled since George Farmer had been dropped the previous November. Robert Smalley's position in goal was also under threat from an emerging twenty-year-old Scot named Jack Angus while David Kirkwood having lost the battle to secure the inside right birth to Alec Brady, now shared the centre back duties with Charlie Parry", "This settled look ensured that there were just two new faces in the opening day 4\u20131 victory at West Bromwich Albion, Campbell, who scored and Angus who kept goal in the side listed above as the most settled team used that season.  The team remained unchanged through the first four games of the campaign, which were all won, before Latta missed the fifth game. Everton still won to take their winning start to five games before being held to a 2\u20132 draw at Aston Villa. Everton remained unbeaten for their first seven games but their first choice eleven did not play again as a run of three straight defeats saw the return of Robert Smalley for one game in place of Jack Angus before David Jardine was signed in November from Bootle."]}, {"page": "Bill Smalley", "response": ["Smalley was born in Darwen and was on the books of Preston North End's reserve team but had not played for the first\u2013team. When Stoke went to Deepdale, the home of Preston North End on 6 October 1888 they were missing two players who failed to board the train the morning so Preston lent them Smalley and fellow reserve team player Alfred Dempsey. The visitors were overwhelmed in a 7\u20130 defeat and Smalley never played first\u2013team football again.

Davies was at outside-right. The first half was pretty much one-way traffic and although Everton had some attacks West Bromwich Albion dominated putting three past Everton goalkeeper Robert Smalley before half-time. Half-time: Everton 0\u20133 West Bromwich Albion. Everton hoped to lead a revival in the second half but suffered two major setbacks. Frank Sugg went off with an injured right foot and then James Costley had to withdraw leaving Everton with just nine men. Edgar Chadwick gave Everton some hope with an early goal. Everton tried to get a second goal but were not successful and towards the end with only nine men West Brom scored a fourth through a goalmouth scrimmage.
