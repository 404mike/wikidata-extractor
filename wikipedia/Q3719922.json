He set the precedent that the Chair of Zoology at UCL (then the University of London) was also the curator of the comparative zoology collection. On his death Grant left his own collection to the museum, and was briefly succeeded by William Henry Allchin before care of the collection passed to invertebrate zoologist Edwin Ray Lankester in 1875. Lankester was curator until 1891 and added significantly to the museum collection. Later lecturer curators included evolutionary biologist W. F. R. Weldon, Edward Alfred Minchin, embryologist J. P. Hill and palaeontologist D. M. S. Watson. After 1948 the curatorship of the museum was no longer the responsibility of the Chair of Zoology and the museum was under the care of professional curators."]}, {"page": "Minchin", "response": ["* Edward Alfred Minchin (1866\u20131915), British zoologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| Edward Alfred Minchin||04/05/1911||22 February 1866 \u2013 30 September 1915"]}, {"page": "Muriel Robertson", "response": ["In 1907 she was awarded a Carnegie Fellowship and moved to Ceylon to study trypanosome infections in reptiles.
