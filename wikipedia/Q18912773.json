Earlier works by William Harcus and John Fairfax Conigrave were superior and better illustrated. The Northern Territory Times was dismissive of the \"sketch of the Territory\"\"Once upon a time there was a storekeeper's clerk here of that name [H. D. Wilson], and as he was not amongst us long enough to become well-informed, it would be entirely in keeping with the \"merits \" of the new handbook to suppose that he is the author of that part of the work which refers to the Northern Territory.\""]}]}}
