This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did take the opportunity to buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man looking away from the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end."]}, {"page": "Shibden Hall", "response": ["For 300 years (c. 1615\u20131926) the Shibden estate was in the hands of the Lister family, wealthy mill-owners and cloth merchants, the most famous resident being Anne Lister (1791\u20131840), who became sole owner of the hall after the death of her aunt. She commissioned York architect John Harper and landscape gardener Samuel Gray in 1830 to make extensive improvements to the house and grounds. A gothic tower was added to the building for use as a library and the major features of the park created, including terraced gardens, rock gardens, cascades and a boating lake.Shibden Park: Shibden's historic landscape  at Calderdale Council A \"Paisley shawl\" garden designed for the terrace by Joshua Major was added in the 1850s. After Anne Lister's death in 1840 in the Caucasus, the estate passed to her partner, Ann Walker, who died in 1854. Possession then returned to the Lister family, who donated it to Halifax Corporation in 1933, which in the next year opened it as a museum."]}, {"page": "Blacktoft", "response": ["The church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was designated a Grade II listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The church was constructed in 1841 by John Harper, of ashlar masonry with a west tower, Perpendicular-style windows, and a nave with apse at the east.Pevsner, Nikolaus; The Buildings of England. Yorkshire: York and the East Riding p.\u00a0193; Penguin (1972); reprinted 1975, Pevsner Architectural Guides.  The stability of a previous Blacktoft church was causing concern in the early 1740s. A contemporary court report noted that the chancel of the church had been re-built to a lower height than one existing earlier, resulting in a gap between the top of the new chancel and nave. This gap was closed by stooths\u2014wooden studs or battens\u2014on the exterior of the nave supporting a beam. The court heard that the earlier higher chancel roof had collapsed in the early 1660s as the congregation were leaving the church\u2014this information was treated with scepticism by a prosecutor, but was supported by local masons and carpenters.Purvis, J.

The street became a popular area for entertainment, with the York Subscription Library opening in 1836, the Yorkshire Club operating for a time at 5 St Leonard's Place, and the De Grey Rooms, used for concerts and meetings, opening in 1842.
