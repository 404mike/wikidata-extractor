As an all-rounder, he batted right-handed, and was a right-handed fast-bowler between 1920 and 1936. Over 386 first-class matches (661 innings), Shipman scored 13682 runs, at an average of 23.22, with 15 centuries, and a top score of 226.\nIn 1921, The Cricketer said \u201cShipman, of Leicestershire, is a cricketer with a future. Only twenty years of age, he bowls fast right hand with an easy run up to the crease and an excellent action. At present, he is rather weedy in build, but if he could put on a stone or two - we recommend a course of physical training during the winter - he might well develop into an England bowler.\u201dAs a bowler, he took 607 wickets, at an average of 25.36 with 16 five wicket hauls. His brother, Bill Shipman, also played first-class cricket for Leicestershire. In 1928, he represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players fixture.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Coventry (cricketer)", "response": ["His final appearance came, after a two-year gap, in June 1935 against Leicestershire; he bowed out quietly with 4 and 11 not out and did not bowl, though he did hold a catch to dismiss Alan Shipman off the bowling of Reg Perks."]}, {"page": "Alfred Goulder", "response": ["Born in Attercliffe, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, Goulder was a left arm orthodox spinner and left-handed tail end batsman, who made his debut against an 'All England XI' at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, at the end of July 1929.  He did not bat as Alan Barber (100) and Edgar Oldroyd (143) put on 203 for the second wicket, to help Yorkshire post 320 for 4.  He bowled 11 overs and took the wickets of Eddie Dawson and Alan Shipman for 21, before rain forced the abandonment of the final day's play.  His second, and final game, was the County Championship clash against Derbyshire again at Bramall Lane, in August.  Batting at number eleven, he fell leg before wicket to Tommy Mitchell for three runs, and his only success with the ball came when he dismissed Stan Worthington, caught by Frank Dennis, for six.  He finished with a first-class career bowling average of 30.00."]}, {"page": "Antony Legard", "response": ["Legard made his first-class debut for Oxford against Leicestershire at The University Parks in May 1932; he took four wickets, including that of Alan Shipman in both innings."]}, {"page": "Shipman", "response": ["*Alan Shipman (1901\u20131979), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "William Victor Fox", "response": ["and Leicestershire's Alan Shipman in 1929."]}, {"page": "Bill Shipman", "response": ["Shipman was born in the village of Ratby, Leicestershire on 1 March 1886. He was one of three brothers who played cricket for Leicestershire; Alan Shipman played almost 400 matches for the county, while Albert Shipman appeared in seven matches for the second XI during the 1914 season. He died in Ratby on 26 August 1943, at the age of 57."]}, {"page": "Francis Prentice", "response": ["Not yet qualified, Prentice had made his first-class debut in Leicestershire's match against Oxford University in 1934, batting at No 7 in the first innings, when he made 39, but opening in the second innings. He was picked for the first game of the 1935 season and kept his place through what Wisden Cricketers' Almanack called \"the most successful season in the history of the club\". Prentice himself had a modest record, with 713 runs at an average of 16.20, and only two scores of more than 50. But, Wisden noted, \"possessed of a solid defence, (he) often played an invaluable innings in a crisis\". His record improved to 989 runs and an average of 24.12 in 1936, but Wisden was less impressed: \"Prentice showed extremely sound defence, but did not appear to have many strokes at his command,\" it wrote, noting also that, with the likely unavailability of Alan Shipman in 1937, \"efforts were made to convert Prentice into an opening batsman\". Prentice was awarded his county cap in 1936."]}, {"page": "Haydon Smith", "response": ["Smith's second breakthrough season was 1932 when he appeared in all matches and compensated for the decline in other bowlers such as Snary and Alan Shipman by taking 83 wickets at an average of 25.73. In fact, Smith continued to prosper as his colleagues declined: in 1933, Leicestershire experienced what Wisden termed \"their worst season since they were promoted to first-class  rank in 1895\". The county finished at the bottom of the County Championship table for the first time, and both batting weaknesses and ageing bowlers were exposed; Smith, by contrast, had his best season yet and his 118 wickets put him at the top of the county's bowling averages. He did not maintain that leading position in 1934 as other bowlers recovered their form, but in fact his figures were better: 121 wickets at an average of 22.56.  His second innings analysis of six wickets for 39 runs was responsible for Leicestershire's first victory over Yorkshire for 23 years. The Times report said that it was \"the most sensational victory of the season\": Yorkshire had declared their first innings 102 ahead with only five wickets down but, set 149 to win, were all out for 90."]}, {"page": "Gustavus Fowke", "response": ["Fowke was one of those over-40s, but was in fact only at the start of his cricket career, and he remained as Leicestershire's captain for the next five seasons, overseeing a transition in the team that saw the retirement of older players such as John King, Samuel Coe and Arthur Mounteney and the introduction of the nucleus of the team of the 1930s with Les Berry, Norman Armstrong, Haydon Smith and Alan Shipman. His own performances did not equal those of 1922, but nor did they fall much short: he made at least 500 runs in each season and his season average only once dipped below 15 runs per innings. His only century for Leicestershire was an innings of 104 in the match against Northamptonshire in 1923. In that match and in others until the emergence of Eddie Dawson, Berry and Shipman as regular opening batsmen, Fowke opened the innings, but later he dropped down the batting order to No 6 or No 7, and sometimes even lower. He missed a few matches in 1926 through a leg strain, but otherwise maintained fitness through to the end of the 1927 season, when he played in 29 first-class matches, more than in any other season, and then retired."]}, {"page": "John Tew", "response": ["The son of E. W. Tew and his wife,  Catherine Isabel Hawke (sister of Lord Hawke),Nephew of Lord Hawke Married. Leeds Mercury. 9 September 1935. p. 5 he was born in September 1905 at Wigginton, Yorkshire. He was educated at Eton College, before going up to Magdalen College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Leicestershire at Oxford in 1927. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed in the Oxford first-innings for 4 runs by Alan Shipman, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by Alec Skelding for 9 runs."]}]}}
