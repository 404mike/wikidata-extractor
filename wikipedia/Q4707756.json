As an all-rounder, he batted right-handed, and was a right-handed fast-bowler between 1920 and 1936. Over 386 first-class matches (661 innings), Shipman scored 13682 runs, at an average of 23.22, with 15 centuries, and a top score of 226.\nIn 1921, The Cricketer said \u201cShipman, of Leicestershire, is a cricketer with a future. Only twenty years of age, he bowls fast right hand with an easy run up to the crease and an excellent action. At present, he is rather weedy in build, but if he could put on a stone or two - we recommend a course of physical training during the winter - he might well develop into an England bowler.\u201dAs a bowler, he took 607 wickets, at an average of 25.36 with 16 five wicket hauls. His brother, Bill Shipman, also played first-class cricket for Leicestershire. In 1928, he represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players fixture.", "link_mentions": {}}}
