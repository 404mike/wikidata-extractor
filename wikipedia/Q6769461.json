He played six times during his seven years for Crewe's first team, and was sent out on loan six times during his spell at the club. Following a loan spell at his hometown club, Northwich Victoria, he joined the club on a permanent basis in 2007. Roberts played 20 games for the Cheshire club during the second half of the 2006\u201307 season, before returning to the Football League with Accrington Stanley in summer 2007. He played 37 games for the club, before being loaned back to Northwich Victoria, a move which was later made permanent.\nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, Roberts joined Stevenage on an initial one-month loan agreement, before signing permanently in January 2009 for an undisclosed fee. That season, he was part of the team that won the FA Trophy in May 2009. Roberts was made team captain ahead of the 2009\u201310 season, a season in which Roberts would help lead the team to the Football League for the first time in the club's history. The following season, the club earned back-to-back promotions following their sixth-place finish and subsequent League Two play-off victory in May 2011. He also spent two spells as caretaker manager of the club, once in January 2012 and again in March 2013.\nAfter a successful four-and-a-half-year spell at Stevenage, Roberts joined Fleetwood Town on a free transfer in July 2013. He captained Fleetwood to promotion via the play-offs during his first season with the club. After two seasons at Fleetwood, Roberts joined League Two club Cambridge United in May 2015, where he spent two seasons.

Although he returned to first-team training in January 2013, he ruptured his achilles in a training session, ultimately ruling him out for the remainder of the season. Following the departure of manager Gary Smith in March 2013, Ashton was named as part of the club's coaching staff while the board appointed a new manager. At the end of the season, with Ashton's contract expiring in June 2013, he signed a new two-year deal with Stevenage, thus keeping him contracted to the club until the summer of 2015.", "Ahead of the 2013\u201314 season, Ashton was appointed club captain following the departure of his predecessor, Mark Roberts.

He symbolises the desire to succeed that is at the heart of Stevenage and his ambition is stronger than ever\".

Westley brought in former player, Dino Maamria as first-team coach at the club. This, coupled with signings during the season, such as Chris Day, Mark Roberts, and Jon Ashton, meant that Stevenage improved during the second half of the season.

Maamria's appointment, alongside a number of new signings such as Roberts and Jon Ashton, coincided with an upturn in form for Stevenage, with the club going on a club record 24-game unbeaten run stretching from December 2008 to April 2009.
