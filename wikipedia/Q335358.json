These comprised one public territory (known as St. George's) and eight \"tribes\" (soon retitled as \"parishes\"). These \"tribes\" were subdivided into lots, separated by narrow tribe roads (supposedly created by clearing the path of a barrel rolled from the south to north shores). These roads served both to demarcate the boundaries of lots, and also as access routes to the shoreline, as the primary method of transport about Bermuda would remain by boat for the next three centuries. Each of the lots equated to shares in the company. Each of the tribes was named for a major \"adventurer\" (shareholder) of the Company. Most were nobles, who used the toponyms of their titles, hence most of the parishes bear place names from England, Scotland, or Wales: Devonshire (for William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire, 1552\u20131626), Hamilton (for James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton, 1589\u20131625), Pembroke (for William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, 1580\u20131630), Southampton (for Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, 1573\u20131624), and Warwick (for Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, 1587\u20131658). The others are Paget (for William Paget, 4th Baron Paget de Beaudesert, 1572\u20131629), Sandys (for Sir Edwin Sandys, 1561\u20131629), and Smith's (for Sir Thomas Smith, 1588\u20131625). Hamilton Parish was originally named Bedford, after Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, who sold her shares to the Scottish nobleman, James Hamilton. Devonshire Parish had originally been named Cavendish Tribe. The short-lived use of the word \"tribes\" for administrative regions appears to have been unique to the Bermuda example. The ninth parish was common (or King's, or general) land, not subdivided by tribe roads, and was named for the patron saint of England, Saint George. It includes the island and the town both of the same name."]}, {"page": "Bess of Hardwick", "response": ["** Lady Mary Talbot who married William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke.

Several times he found himself opposed to the schemes of the Duke of Buckingham, and he was keenly interested in the colonization of America. He was Lord Chamberlain of the royal household from 1615 to 1625 and Lord Steward from 1626 to 1630. He was Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1624 when Thomas Tesdale and Richard Wightwick refounded Broadgates Hall and named it Pembroke College in his honour. By some Shakespearian commentators Pembroke has been identified with the \"Mr W. H.\" referred to as \"the onlie begetter\" of Shakespeare's sonnets in the dedication by Thomas Thorpe, the owner of the published manuscript, while his mistress, Mary Fitton, has been identified with the \"dark lady\" of the sonnets. In both cases the identification rests on very questionable evidence.

Massinger left Oxford without a degree in 1606. His father had died in 1603, and that may have left him without financial assistance. The lack of a degree and the want of patronage from Lord Pembroke may both be explained on the supposition that he had become Roman Catholic. On leaving the university he went to London to make his living as a dramatist, but his name cannot be definitely affixed to any play until fifteen years later, when The Virgin Martyr (registered with the Stationers Company, 7 December 1621) appeared as the work of Massinger and Thomas Dekker."]}, {"page": "1630 in literature", "response": ["*April 10 \u2013 English literature, drama, and education lose a major patron and benefactor when William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke and Lord Chamberlain of England, diesNational Portrait Gallery: William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke (1580-1630), Lord Chamberlain.

The evidence comes from a payment to the Lord Chamberlain's Men for performances of three unnamed plays on St. Stephen's Day 1598, New Year's Day 1599, and Shrove Tuesday 1599 (i.e. 20 February). Juliet Dusinberre believes Touchstone's reference to pancakes (1.2.50\u201351) provides evidence that As You Like It was the unnamed play performed on 20 February.  Another possible early performance may have taken place in December 1603 at Wilton House. In 1865, William Johnson Cory said that whilst visiting Wilton, he was told of a letter from the Countess of Pembroke to her son, William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, urging him to bring King James from Salisbury so he may see a performance of As You Like It at the house. James did come, residing at Wilton from 24 November to 12 December. Although Cory did not actually see the letter himself, and it has never been found or verified, a record of a payment to the Lord Chamberlain's Men for an unnamed play in December does exist, suggesting that something was performed at Wilton, but whether it was As You Like It seems impossible to ascertain. A Charles Johnson rewrite of the play, called Love in a Forest, was performed at Drury Lane on 9 January 1723.
