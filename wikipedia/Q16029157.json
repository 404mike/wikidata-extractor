Marston wrote her, \"Much as we all love and admire your work, it seems to me we have not yet fully realized the unostentatious loveliness of your lyrics, as fine for lyrics as your best sonnets are for sonnets. 'How Long' struck me more than ever. The first verse is eminently characteristic of you, exhibiting in a very marked degree what runs through nearly all of your poems, the most exquisite and subtle blending of strong emotion with the sense of external nature. It seems to me this perfect poem is possessed by the melancholy yet tender music of winds sighing at twilight, in some churchyard, through old trees that watch beside silent graves. Then nothing can be more subtly beautiful than the closing lines of the sonnet, 'In Time to Come':\u2014 \"'Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I? I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'\" Marston wrote her again concerning \"The House of Death\" that it was one of the most beautiful, the most powerful poems he knew. \"No poem gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of Nature. The poem is Death within and Summer without\u2014light girdling darkness\u2014and it leaves a picture and impression on the mind never to be effaced.\" The poem of \"The House of Death\" is unequalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness. It was apropos of this volume that in one of his letters to her Robert Browning said he had closed the book with music in his ears and flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts across his brain. And it was concerning a later poem, \"Laus Veneris,\" inspired by a painting of his own, that Edward Burne-Jones said it made him work all the more confidently and was a real refreshment."]}, {"page": "St James's Hall", "response": ["In 1892 Alexander Mackenzie succeeded Cowen.
