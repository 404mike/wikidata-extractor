As Meadows and Detective Inspector Neil Manson (Andrew Lancel) question the suspects, Smithy visits Jasmine in hospital, where she refuses to give a statement and prosecute. Due to a lack of evidence, the team are forced to release Simmons, Wilson and Carlos Miller. Jasmine is discharged from hospital, and still refuses to give a statement. However, as the team sees fit to give up, much to the anger of Mickey, CSE Eddie Olosunje (Jason Barnett) discovers that the gunshot fired at the end of the previous episode was fired upwards, and so possibly to alert passers-by, and to stop the gang-rape. Due to CCTV footage, the officers believe that gang member Derek Bailey (Femi Wilhelm) fired the shot, and set out to find him as a potential witness. They pull in courier Ruby Collier (Shahnequa Duprey). She initially refuses to help them, but sends Mickey a text message that leads uniform to Bailey's location. Sergeant Stone (Sam Callis) ascends to the top storey, where he discovers Bailey dying from a gunshot wound, inflicted by Gary Wilson, who holds Stone at gunpoint, when he attempts to help Bailey. Armed police officers arrive, and prepare to fire at Stone, who tussles with Wilson. A gunshot is heard, but nobody is harmed. Bailey is taken to hospital, and Wilson is arrested. After talking to Smithy and Mickey, Jasmine finally agrees to a statement, which helps to convict Wilson and the others of gang-rape. However, Jack is able to elicit a confession to Liam Martin's murder from Gary Wilson.", "In the finale, Callum Stone (Sam Callis) has to chase a suspect using one of the panda cars whilst Inspector Smith (Alex Walkinshaw) follows on foot.  The dangerous parts of the car pursuit were carried out by stuntman Andy Smart, once Smart had finished filming, small car-mounted cameras filmed Callis driving before the shots were then cut together with those filmed by Smart. Later, when he finds hostage Derek Bailey, Stone comes face-to-face with Gary Wilson, the armed criminal responsible for Jasmine's rape and Liam Martin's murder. The Bill does not use extras for any scenes involving armed police; so, for this scene, the armed police surrounding the flat were played by \"men who have been trained in the use of firearms and know what they're doing with a gun\". The show has a stock of thirty replica weapons identical to those used by the Metropolitan Police although they are incapable of firing any shots.  To prepare for the scene, a bag of fake blood is wrapped around the hostage's stomach and is punctured shortly before filming begins so when the actor clutches his stomach it will look as if he is bleeding."]}, {"page": "Dan Hamilton", "response": ["Registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola) begins a rivalry with Dan after he undermines him over the treatment of a patient.

In Ethan's case this is Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It begins when Ethan and his HEMS colleague Albert 'Big Al' Layne (Sam Callis), receive an emergency call informing them that a lorry has driven into a crowded indoor market. Rainsford told Hannah Davies of What's on TV that Ethan and Al are \"polar opposites\" who gain a \"mutual respect\" of one-another through the events of the attack. They are the first responders to the incident; Rainsford spoke of scenes of \"total carnage with blood and bodies everywhere.\" Ethan tries to save victims from the wreckage, but Al warns him that they need to leave. Ethan continues trying to help and an explosion causes further carnage. Rainsford explained that \"all hell breaks loose\" and \"Ethan puts himself and those around him in danger.\" Ethan and Al are left trapped under rubble, Ethan is covered in blood and dust. Al supports Ethan and tries to keep him comfortable while the rescue effort continues. Ethan is rescued but Al dies at the scene. Rainsford noted that Ethan had already been through so much trauma and now has to contend with effects of the attack. It took eight days to film the stunt and the scenes were showcased during the opening episode of a series. This meant it was a scaled up production with \"exciting equipment and stunts\". Wind machines were used to distort the actors faces and crash mats for falling stunts. Rainsford branded the experience one that an actor would pay to participate in. The attack stunts became Rainsford's favourite ever story to film throughout his entire duration."]}, {"page": "Callis", "response": ["*Sam Callis (born 1973), British actor and director"]}, {"page": "The Lost Pirate Kingdom", "response": ["*Sam Callis as Benjamin Hornigold"]}]}}
