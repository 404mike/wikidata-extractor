Scabies formed a one-off band called \"Les Punks\" for a late 1978 gig: Les Punks was a quasi-reunion of The Damned (without Brian James or Lu) that featured Scabies, Vanian, Sensible and bassist Lemmy of Hawkwind and Mot\u00f6rhead. The Damned tentatively reformed with the \"Les Punks\" line-up in early 1979, but originally performed as \"The Doomed\" to avoid potential trademark problems. Captain Sensible switched to guitar and keyboards, and after a brief period with Lemmy on bass for studio demos and a handful of live appearances,see the notes for Smash It Up - The Anthology 1976\u20131987 and a slightly longer period with Henry Badowski on bass, the bassist position was filled by Algy Ward, formerly of The Saints.

In the first series, the men live and work on a building site in D\u00fcsseldorf. The series was created by Franc Roddam after an idea from Mick Connell, a bricklayer from Stockton-on-Tees, and mostly written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who also wrote The Likely Lads, Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? and Porridge. It starred Tim Healy, Kevin Whately, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, Christopher Fairbank, Pat Roach and Gary Holton, with Noel Clarke replacing Holton for series three and four and the two-part finale. The series were broadcast on ITV in 1983\u20131984 and 1986. After a sixteen-year gap, two series and a Christmas special were shown on BBC One in 2002 and 2004.", "They find work on a German building site in D\u00fcsseldorf but despite promises of hostel accommodation, are forced to live in a small hut that reminds them of a World War II POW camp. The rest of the series is driven by the interactions and growing friendships between the various characters. Barry (Timothy Spall), an electrician from the Black Country, is an obsessive bore; Neville (Kevin Whately), one of the Geordie bricklayers, is an insecure young newlywed; fellow Geordie Oz (Jimmy Nail), another bricklayer, is aggressive and jingoistic; and London joiner Wayne (Gary Holton) is a womaniser. The third Geordie is Dennis (Tim Healy), a bricklayer who, being older, more experienced and generally more mature than the others, becomes the de facto leader of the group. The others are Bristolian bricklayer Bomber (Pat Roach) and Scouse ex-con plasterer Moxey (Fairbank). Over the course of 13 episodes the \"Magnificent Seven\" enjoy comic, dramatic, and romantic adventures, until a change in German tax laws forces them to return home.", "The second series had several on-set problems. Actor Gary Holton died before some of the final indoor scenes were filmed, and the scripts had to be reworked to explain Wayne's absence from these indoor scenes. Examples of this include various characters enquiring about Wayne's whereabouts, only to be told that he was chatting up a girl in the next room or that he had gone away for the day. A double was used in other scenes, such as one where Bomber manhandles Wayne away from Ally's girlfriend in a nightclub. The transmission of the final episode of Series 2 (Quo Vadis Pet) saw an introduction by Tim Healy dedicating the episode to Holton.", ":Wayne (Gary Holton) describes himself as a . A Londoner, he is a carpenter (or \"chippy\") by trade and has an obsession for women which often lands him and his friends in trouble. Initially without transport he relied on friends for lifts but by series 2 he has bought a red BMW 520. At the end of the first series, Wayne marries Christa, (played by Lysette Anthony), a secretary at the building site. The actor Gary Holton died in 1985 after overdosing on drugs and before the filming of the second series finished. Often, Wayne's absence in the second series is explained in dialogue with phrases like \"He's gone to town to look for girls\". The series was not filmed in chronological order, so he is present in the final episode yet absent during earlier scenes. The last episode is dedicated to Gary Holton."]}, {"page": "Gary Olsen", "response": ["He made his screen debut in 1979 as Rory Storm in Birth of The Beatles, and appeared in numerous British films and television programmes, such as cult classic Quadrophenia after being suggested to the director by his long time friend Gary Holton.

Together they produced Girlschool's cover of the T-Rex song \"20th Century Boy\" and the album Play Dirty which featured two Slade tracks \"Burning in the Heat of Love\" and \"High and Dry\". The \"High and Dry\" track was originally written for Girlschool but still appeared on Slade's album that same year. Lea also produced the Holder/Lea penned \"Simple Love\" for the actress and model Sue Scadding. Released by Speed records and with Lea's brother, Frank on drums, the single failed to achieve any commercial success. Initially the song was intended for Slade but no version by the band is known to exist. The B-side was another Holder and Lea composition, \"Poland\", which Lea released as a single himself the year before under the name Greenfields of Tong. In 1984 Lea also produced an album for singer / actor Gary Holton. Lea also played all the instruments (except drums, played by Geoff Seopardi) on two singles from the album; Holton's cover version of \"Catch a Falling Star\" and \"That's How the Story Goes\".
