Van Barneveld went 2\u20130 up in legs before van Gerwen threw a 10-dart leg, but he missed one dart to level the game in the next leg allowing his Dutch rival to finish on 96 to knock him out. Van Gerwen's average of 105.78 was at the time the highest ever to lose a match in the history of the event.
