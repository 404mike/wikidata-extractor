The boom in the ironstone industry meant that some communities had a new occupational lifeline. The discovery of the Eston ironstone by Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan in 1850, accelerated the industrialisation of the area as the ironstone outcropped quite close to the surface and could be recovered more easily than on the coast, which was dependent on the tides, and from the mines further south, which had to go to greater depths to recover the stone. In August 1850, the find of stone was proved, and by December of the same year, the first shipment of ironstone, , was taken over a newly built tramway from Eston into Middlesbrough. The Rosedale mines developed in the 1860s, and were connected via a railway that ran across the moors, and down a steep incline near Ingleby Greenhow, which then joined with the main railway network at what would become  railway station. The ore at Rosedale was roasted with coal (calcined) to remove impurities and lessen the overall weight of the ore, so that the transportation costs were cheaper, as the companies had to pay the landowners per tonne of ore transported over the railway."]}, {"page": "Borough of Middlesbrough", "response": ["| Henry Bolckow", "The first Mayor of Middlesbrough was the German-born Henry Bolckow in 1853.
