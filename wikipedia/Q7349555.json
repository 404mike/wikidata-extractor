And what could be more artistic than that?\" In the same issue, the newspaper's K Foundation art award witness, Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all \"entertaining, and satirically quite sharp\", but \"the art world has chosen not to think [of it as art].... The general view remains that the K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn't very original.

Around 4,000 fans gathered outside Buckingham Palace in central London when the Beatles received their MBEs from the Queen. As the crowd chanted \"God save the Beatles\" and \"Yeah, yeah, yeah!\", some fans jostled with police officers and scaled the palace gates.

Author Chris Ingham calls the song \"skillful\" and \"haunting\", displaying the same \"minor-major ambivalence\" heard on Lennon's \"I'll Be Back\". Howard Kramer of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also compares it to \"I'll Be Back\", saying they both \"ring slightly of melancholy\" and anticipate the style of songs heard eighteen months later on Rubber Soul. Writing for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger contends that the song was McCartney's most mature to that point. He writes that, in hindsight, its rapidly strummed acoustic guitar triplets signaled the band's turn to folk rock, pointing out that the American folk rock band the Byrds covered it in their early live shows. Tom Ewing of Pitchfork describes the song as \"wintry and philosophical before the surprising, stirring middle eight\". Journalist Robert Sandall suggests that the song's \"mood of brooding reverie\" is more closely aligned with fan's perceptions of Lennon's feelings than McCartney's. Writer Ian MacDonald also states it is closer in style to Lennon than McCartney, further writing that the song \"established a model of strident dramatic contrasts\" for the Beatles' next album, Beatles for Sale, heard in songs like \"Baby's In Black\", \"Every Little Thing\", \"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\" and \"No Reply\"."]}, {"page": "Short Sharp Shocked", "response": ["Q' magazine's Robert Sandall wrote: \"Where this album hits hardest is in the playful unpredictability of [Pete] Anderson and Shocked's arrangements,\" observed . \"'When I Grow Up'\u00a0... introduces a jazzy, acoustic bass shuffle, then starts bouncing miscellaneous sound inserts around beneath the vocal.

Written during the Falklands War of 1982, Costello's lyrics highlight the irony of the war bringing back prosperity to the traditional shipbuilding areas of Clydeside , Merseyside (Cammell Laird), North East England and Belfast (Harland and Wolff) to build new ships to replace those being sunk in the war, whilst also sending off the sons of these areas to fight and, potentially, lose their lives in those same ships. According to Robert Sandall, the best version of the song is the one recorded and released as a single by English singer-songwriter Robert Wyatt in August 1982 a few months after the Falklands War, although it was not a hit until it was re-released eight months later on the first anniversary of the conflict."]}, {"page": "All I Need (Radiohead song)", "response": ["\"All I Need\" is a sombre song with lyrics detailing obsession and love.
