He served under General John Burgoyne in the Battle of Saratoga.  Taken prisoner in the United States, he was sent back to Britain in 1781. He stayed in the army one more year, then returned to private life. He wrote \u201cTravels Through the Interior Parts of America, 1771-1781\u201d which was published in England in 1789. It was published again in London in 1791, described as a New Edition.

Anburey claimed that two Native American warriors, one of them Le Loup, were escorting McCrea to Burgoyne's camp when they started to quarrel over an expected reward for bringing her there. One of the pair then killed and scalped her, and Le Loup ended up with the scalp. Anburey also claimed that she was taken against her will, though he noted that there were also rumors that she was being escorted at her fianc\u00e9's request. A second account of her death, given by Le Loup while he was questioned by the British, was that McCrea was killed by American forces stationed at Fort Edward firing at the attacking Native Americans while they were retreating. Historian James Phinney Baxter supported the second account in his work The British Invasion from the North (1887) where he asserted that an exhumation of her body revealed only bullet wounds and no tomahawk wounds. McCrea's death was also reported by American surgeon John Bartlett, who claimed McCrea and McNeil were taken by the Native Americans to Burgoyne's camp, where McCrea was shot and scalped."]}, {"page": "St. George's Church, Penang", "response": ["Proposals for the building of a permanent church were submitted as early as 1810 but was only acted upon after the passing of the East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) whereby the EIC received a 20-year extension of its charter. Approval was obtained in 1815 to build the church based on the architectural plans drawn up by Major Thomas Anburey but the church was eventually built on the plans drawn up by the Governor of Prince of Wales Island (as Penang was known then), William Petrie, and modified by Lieutenant Robert N. Smith of the Madras Engineers. Smith was a colleague of Colonel James Lillyman Caldwell, the chief architect of St. George's Cathedral in Madras, and the architecture of St. George's Church is believed to be based on the cathedral itself."]}, {"page": "History of slavery in Virginia", "response": ["Plantation owners in Virginia became wealthy during the eighteenth century, as well as members of a new planter aristocracy, by growing tobacco and employing unpaid enslaved people to perform this and other agricultural and domestic labor. The planters were far outnumbered by indentured servants, slaves, and poor white people. Thomas Anburey, an English officer, visited Colonel Randolph's house in Goochland in 1779 and opined that Virginia plantations were owned and operated by refined, educated people. He thought the class of whites who had the most interaction with their slaves were uneducated and unworldly, and generally \"hospitable, generous, and friendly\", but qualified his estimation with the statement that they were \"accustomed to tyrannize with all their good qualities, they are rude, ferocious, and haughty, much attached to gaming and dissipation\"."]}, {"page": "Anburey, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Anburey"]}, {"page": "Thomas Mann Randolph Sr.", "response": ["In 1761, Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. married Anne Cary (1745\u20131789), the daughter of Archibald Cary and Mary Randolph Cary of Ampthill.

The house came to have an h-shaped layout, with a north wing, hyphen, and a south wing. The mansion was built for a large family and entertaining.
