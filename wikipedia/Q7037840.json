It features Nico's low, droning harmonium accompanied by Cale's viola. On \"Frozen Warnings\", Cale's arrangement harmonically blends with the pipe organ. It is considered Nico's signature song from her collaboration with Cale; Nina Antonia wrote: \"Of all the strange and wracked numbers on the record, 'Frozen Warnings' is quintessential Nico; lyrics that convey a sorrowful atmosphere and little comfort in the melody.\" The album's dreamlike quality end with its last song, \"Evening of Light\", which has been described as \"frighteningly quiet and hypnotizing\". Nico sings \"Midnight winds are landing at the end of time\", with harpsichord and Cale's staccato viola building until the latter gains ground and sways with the tympani's \"roar and clatter\". The 1991 reissue of The Marble Index also includes the outtakes \"Roses in the Snow\" and \"Nibelungen\". In the latter, Nico's vocals are unaccompanied. The full version (with instrumental accompaniment) was included in the 2007 compilation The Frozen Borderline \u2013 1968\u20131970; according to Dave Thompson of AllMusic, \"It rises to equal any of Nico's subsequent performances or compositions.\""]}, {"page": "Johnny Thunders", "response": ["While other sources state: An autopsy was conducted by the New Orleans coroner, but served only to compound the mysteries.

The album features covers of the Cadets' 1956 hit \"Stranded in the Jungle\", Archie Bell's 1969 hit \"There's Gonna Be a Showdown\", and Sonny Boy Williamson's \"Don't Start Me Talkin'\".
