Chris Barrie played titular character Gordon Brittas, the well-intended but hugely incompetent manager of the fictional Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.", "The creators Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen often combined farce with either surreal or dramatic elements in episodes. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to become electrocuted. Unlike many traditional sitcoms, deaths were quite commonplace in The Brittas Empire. Barrie described the humour as \"straightfoward, slapstick, very accessible characters, larger-than-life abnormal things happening in a very normal situation\".", "For the first five series the show's creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote every episode. After series 5 they left, along with actress Julia St John who played deputy manager Laura.

This was originally meant to be the end of the show's run.", "In October 2020, the cast and original writers attended the re-launching the Ringwood Recreation Centre, where the series was filmed, and Barrie hoped the event would be a catalyst for an eighth series. He advised \"there's so much momentum for it now's the time.\" At this stage, original writers, Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen, were working on a new script. In a 2021 reunion, the cast mentioned that they were still keen to revive the show, though the hiccup was finding a broadcaster to pick it up."]}, {"page": "Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize", "response": ["::* 9\u201311 years: Aquila by Andrew Norriss (Puffin Books)"]}, {"page": "Brenda Blethyn", "response": ["In 1989, she starred in The Labours of Erica, a sitcom written for her by Chance in a Million writers Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss.

The show was created by Andrew Norriss and was produced for seven series that aired on CITV from 14 November 1997 to 31 March 2005.", "The concept of the show originally formed the basis of one of the most famous episodes of The Twilight Zone, entitled \"A Kind of a Stopwatch\", first broadcast in 1963. In 1991, Alexander John Howard conceived of a series based on the same concept but it took six years to get funding. The show eventually began as a single 15-minute episode, however it was suggested it could work as a series. Four more stories were written by creator Andrew Norriss, who thought, in his own words, \"that would be it\". However he ended up writing six series.", "As well as the TV series, Andrew Norriss also wrote a novel based on the series in 1999. In the context of the novel, Bernard received the watch from an elderly aunt, who had received it from her husband who acquired it from an old friend, although they never knew how the friend had obtained the watch as by the time he passed it on he had suffered a stroke and couldn't speak. Unlike in the TV show where using the watch was harmless, the watch has a subtle side-effect on the user in that it uses up the iron in their blood, requiring regular users to consume iron vitamins on a regular basis, causing Bernard to collapse when he avoids taking the iron-tainted drink provided by his aunt because he didn't like the taste and was unaware of the side-effects of the watch. On a personal note, Bernard is only living with his father, as his mother died before the events of the novel, and Karen is also shown as only having one parent. At the novel's conclusion, the watch is briefly stolen by a woman who once worked as a housekeeper for Bernard's aunt, but she is captured when the watch runs down and she tries to threaten Bernard for the key. Ill at various points throughout the book, Bernard's aunt dies in the penultimate chapter, but her spirit appears to him after her death to tell him that the true purpose of the watch is for 'learning'. In the final chapter, Bernard uses the watch key on a chain his aunt gave him to wind it back up, Bernard and Karen enjoying the restoration of the watch as Bernard concludes that he has time to learn what she meant by that comment."]}, {"page": "University of Winchester", "response": ["* Andrew Norriss \u2013 children's book author and TV sitcom writer"]}, {"page": "Costa Book Awards", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Andrew NorrissAquila"]}, {"page": "List of The Brittas Empire episodes", "response": ["This is a list of episodes, with synopses and airdates, of the British sitcom The Brittas Empire.
