He played for a number of English clubs, and has featured in more than 300 English league games, all of which were in the top two leagues in the country.\nHe represented England's under-21 national team on four occasions, but chose to represent the Wales national team in his senior years, for whom he earned seven caps.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Beckham", "response": ["The league season began with new head coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho at the helm, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n took over on temporary basis as Real's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling Ben Thatcher in an England match against Wales to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next caution, and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. The Football Association asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had \"made a mistake\" and apologised. He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against Valencia. Having received a yellow card, he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal."]}, {"page": "November 30", "response": ["*  1975   \u2013 Ben Thatcher, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1975", "response": ["** Ben Thatcher, Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Thatcher", "response": ["* Ben Thatcher (born 1975), retired Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Millwall F.C.", "response": ["|1996|| Ben Thatcher", "* Ben Thatcher (1995)", "* Ben Thatcher"]}, {"page": "Egil Olsen", "response": ["In June 1999, the then 57-year-old Olsen made his appearance in English football, when he was named as manager of Wimbledon.
