Dollins was an English professional association footballer who played as an inside forward.\nDollins began his career with Burnley in 1909; however, after just eight league appearances he signed for the Clarets' Lancashire rivals Blackpool.\nHe made his debut for the Seasiders, who were yet to appoint their first full-time manager, on 4 November 1911, in a goalless draw at Gainsborough Trinity. He went on to appear in a further four games during the 1911\u201312 league campaign.\nDollins made thirteen starts in 1912\u201313 and scored his only professional goal. It came in the penultimate league game of the season: a 2\u20131 victory over Huddersfield Town at Bloomfield Road on 19 April. He made his final appearance for the club in the next game, a 2\u20131 defeat at arch-rivals Preston North End.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fleetwood", "response": ["*James Dollins, footballer"]}, {"page": "Dollins, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Dollins"]}]}}
