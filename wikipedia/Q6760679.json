At the start of the Spanish Civil War he travelled to Barcelona, and volunteered and briefly served with the POUM militia on the Aragon front, where he wrote his three most famous poems including the often-reprinted \"To Margot Heinemann\" (originally simply entitled Poem). before returning to England, where he recruited twenty-one British volunteers. With this group he travelled to Paris and then on to Albacete, where they joined the International Brigades\u2014the nucleus of what would become the British Section.

While the form is in some respects traditional\u2014ballad-form quatrains rhyming abcb\u2014its rhythms are skillfully irregular, with two to three stresses per line, and its rhymes often slant, including those of the moving last stanza: \"And if bad luck should lay my strength Into the shallow grave, Remember all the good you can; Don't forget my love.\" Rumens says: \"You feel as if you have been presented with a photograph of a young soldier's inner life. He is a passionate lover and a passionate warrior: these qualities are held in perfect psychic balance. And they are timeless. The speaker could be one of Homer's heroes. He could be a Spartan at Thermopylae.\" But the famous opening lines \"Heart of the heartless world, / Dear heart, the thought of you\" actually contain a blind quotation from Marx, who in the Introduction to his Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right describes religion as \"the heart of a heartless world.\""]}, {"page": "A.

Food prices were low, but the advantage went overwhelmingly to the middle and upper classes, with the poorest third of the population suffering from sustained poor nutrition. Starvation was not a factor, but widespread hunger was. The deleterious effects on poor children were obvious to teachers. In 1934, the government began a program of charging school children a halfpenny a day for a third of a pint of milk. This dramatically improved their nutrition, and the new demand kept up the wholesale price of milk paid to farmers. About half the nation's school children participated by 1936. Milk was distributed for free in the Second World War, and participation rose to 90 percent. Indeed, the rationing system of the wartime years sharply improved the nutrition of poorest third, together with their capacity for manual labour.Branson and Heinemann, Britain in the 1930s (1971) pp. 202\u201320.", "As leisure, literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the late 19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.Peter J.

Drinking was differentiated by class. with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle-class pubs. However, drinking as a way of spending leisure time and spare cash declined during the Depression and pub attendance never returned to 1930 levels; it fell far below prewar levels.Peter Haydon, The English pub: a history (1994). Taxes were raised on beer, but there were more alternatives at hand, such as cigarettes (which attracted 8/10 men, and 4/10 women), the talkies, the dance halls, and Greyhound racing. Football pools offered the excitement of betting on a range of results. New estates with small, inexpensive houses offered gardening as an outdoor recreation.
