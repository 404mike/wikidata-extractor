In 1921\u20131922, he joined the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition aboard the Quest. When Sir Ernest Shackleton advert came out in newspapers, the surgeon signed up as he had been on many ships as a surgeon. He was also a dog trainer on Shackleton\u2019s expedition", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest Shackleton", "response": ["Alexander Macklin was one of two surgeons and also in charge of keeping the 70\u00a0dogs healthy. Tom Crean was in more immediate charge as head dog-handler. Other crew included James, Hussey, Greenstreet, a carpenter Harry McNish, and a biologist named Clark. Of later independent fame was the photographer Frank Hurley, known on this mission for his perilous shots.", "In the early hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition's physician, Alexander Macklin, to his cabin, complaining of back pains and other discomfort. According to Macklin's own account, Macklin told him he had been overdoing things and should try to \"lead a more regular life\", to which Shackleton answered: \"You are always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?\" \"Chiefly alcohol, Boss,\" replied Macklin. A few moments later, at 2:50\u00a0a.m. on 5 January 1922, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack."]}, {"page": "Plymouth College", "response": ["*Alexander Macklin (1889\u20131967), surgeon on the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition"]}, {"page": "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["The scientific staff of six accompanying Endurance comprised the two surgeons, Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy; a geologist, James Wordie; a biologist, Robert Clark; a physicist, Reginald W. James; and Leonard Hussey, a meteorologist who would eventually edit Shackleton's expedition account South. The visual record of the expedition was the responsibility of its photographer Frank Hurley and its artist George Marston.Fisher 1957, pp.\u00a0311\u2013314. The final composition of the Ross Sea party was hurried. Some who left Britain for Australia to join Aurora resigned before it departed for the Ross Sea, and a full complement of crew was in doubt until the last minute.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp.\u00a048\u201353. Within the party only Mackintosh and Joyce had any previous Antarctic experience; Mackintosh had lost an eye as the result of an accident during the Nimrod expedition and had gone home early."]}, {"page": "Endurance (1912 ship)", "response": ["* Alexander Macklin, Surgeon"]}, {"page": "Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage", "response": ["Virtually every diary kept during the expedition was made available to the author, and almost all the surviving members at the time of writing submitted to lengthy interviews. The most significant contribution came from Dr. Alexander Macklin, one of the ship's surgeons, who provided Lansing with many diaries, a detailed account of the perilous journey the crew made to Elephant Island, and months of advice.Preface, acknowledgements, Basic Books, 2007."]}, {"page": "Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition", "response": ["Frank Wild, on his fourth trip with Shackleton, filled the second-in-command post as he had on the Endurance  expedition. Frank Worsley, Endurances former captain, became captain of Quest. Other old comrades included surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy, meteorologist Leonard Hussey, engineer Alexander Kerr, seaman Tom McLeod and cook Charles Green. Shackleton had assumed that Tom Crean would sign up, and had assigned him duties \"in charge of boats\", but Crean had retired from the navy to start a family back home in County Kerry, and declined Shackleton's invitation.Smith, p.\u00a0308."]}, {"page": "Perce Blackborow", "response": ["On 24 April 1916, a small party led by Shackleton set sail in the James Caird for distant South Georgia, hoping to return in a few weeks to rescue the others. The rest of the crew, including Blackborow, resigned themselves to waiting on Elephant Island. Almost to a man they were in poor health and spirits. Blackborow had contracted gangrene due to his frostbite, and was surgeon Alexander Macklin's greatest medical concern."]}, {"page": "Harry McNish", "response": ["There is some confusion as to the correct spelling of his name. He is variously referred to as  McNish, McNeish, and in Alexander Macklin's diary of the expedition, MacNish. The McNeish spelling is common, notably in Shackleton's and Frank Worsley's accounts of the expedition and on McNish's headstone, but McNish is also widely used, (Identifying the accompanying diary entry as being from the diary of Henry \"Chippy\" McNish) and appears to be the correct version. On a signed copy of the expedition photo his signature appears as \"H. MacNish\", but his spelling is in general idiosyncratic, as revealed in the diary he kept throughout the expedition. There also is a question regarding McNish's nickname. \"Chippy\" was a traditional nickname for a shipwright; both this and the shorter \"Chips\" (as in wood chips from carpentry) seem to have been used."]}, {"page": "James McIlroy (surgeon)", "response": ["In 1914, McIlroy, along with Alexander Macklin, were the two physicians assigned under Shackleton on 'Endurance', the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, despite suffering from malaria.  Known by the nickname of Mick during the expedition, McIlroy was described by Endurance author Alfred Lansing as \"a handsome, aristocratic-looking individual\" who was seen by his fellow crew as a \"man of the world\". He was known to entertain his crew mates with the stories of his exploits sailing around the world. McIlroy was also in charge of a sled-dog team when the expedition was cast away on the Weddell Sea. He also played the banjo in the team's musical ensemble. After the castaways found a refuge on Elephant Island, McIlroy was the surgeon performing the amputation of Perce Blackborow's gangrenous toes, with Macklin serving as anaesthetist, carefully administering a tiny quantity of salvaged chloroform as anaesthesia. After the rescue of McIlroy and his comrades, the physician was awarded the Silver Polar Medal."]}, {"page": "John Vincent (sailor)", "response": ["Shackleton was later to deny Vincent the Polar Medal, awarded to everybody in the crew except McNish, who had rebelled on the ice, and the three trawlermen: William Stephenson, Ernest Holness and Vincent. Alexander Macklin, one of the ship's surgeons, thought the withholding of the medal a bit hard: \"They were perhaps not very endearing characters but they never let the expedition down\"."]}]}}
