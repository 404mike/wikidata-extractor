In his first match, against Essex, he was the fourth spin bowler used in the Essex first innings, but took four wickets for 81 runs. He then took four for 65 in his second match against Nottinghamshire, five for 53 in his third against Surrey and five for 54 in his fourth and final match of 1947 against Lancashire.He returned to club cricket for several years, until he succeeded John Warr as Middlesex captain in 1961 and 1962.\nHe played in 77 first-class matches between 1947 and 1962, taking 128 wickets at an average cost of 32.87, with a personal best of 6/52.\nHe died following a brain aneurysm, while batting for Finchley C.C. at Buckhurst Hill in 1966.

Middlesex's first four batsmen \u2014 Robertson, Brown, Edrich and Compton \u2014 scored between them 12,193 runs in all first-class matches, a level of success unprecedented in county cricket. The other batting positions were contested by George Mann, who was heir-apparent to Robins as club captain and succeeded him in 1948; Alan Fairbairn, a 1947 debutant who scored centuries in each of his first two county matches; Harry Sharp and Alec Thompson. The three main bowlers were Gray, Young and the veteran Sims. Ian Bedford, aged seventeen, made his debut and took twelve wickets in his first two matches. Middlesex also made effective use as bowlers of Robins, Edrich and Denis Compton. Playfair noted the consistently high standard of the Middlesex fielding, especially by Brown, while Leslie Compton as wicket-keeper was a great success.Playfair, pp. 84\u201385.
