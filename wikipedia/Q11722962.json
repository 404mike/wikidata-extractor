By the age of 17 he was elected chairman of the miners lodge at the Arriel Griffin colliery.\nIn 1917, at the age of 20, he was imprisoned as a conscientious objector to military service in the First World War. He had joined the Independent Labour Party in 1915, and through the ILP he came into contact with the No Conscription Fellowship. When conscription was introduced in 1916, Ness Edwards' conscientious objections to compulsory service were 'absolutist' and based on his trade union and socialist principles. He was treated harshly - imprisoned with hard labour at Dartmoor and later at Wormwood Scrubs, beaten in Brecon barracks and chased naked by soldiers with fixed bayonets, forced to work in stone quarries in freezing weather.He was elected to Parliament at the 1939 Caerphilly by-election, following the death of Labour MP and fellow conscientious objector Morgan Jones. Edwards remained as Caerphilly's MP until his death in 1968.\nAt the beginning of World War II Edwards was instrumental in helping Czech miners escape the Sudetenland.\nAn associate of Aneurin Bevan and Jim Griffiths, Edwards was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour and National Service from 1945 to 1950 and Postmaster General from 1950 to 1951.
