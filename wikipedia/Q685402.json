It seemed as though the only option to repay the debt was the redevelopment of Edgar Street and at the time, it looked as if the club would have to relocate. After a humiliating 4\u20131 defeat to Hayes, Graham Turner stepped down as manager to concentrate on more pressing financial issues. Player-coach Phil Robinson assumed managerial responsibilities and Hereford managed to have another run in the FA Cup. In the Fourth Qualifying Round Hereford were drawn away at Dover and came away with a 1\u20130 win, Gavin Williams scoring the priceless goal. The First Round match at home to Wrexham was televised live on the BBC and the money earned from this fixture kept the club alive. Graham Turner has said that had Hereford not beaten Dover, they would probably have not made it into 2002.
