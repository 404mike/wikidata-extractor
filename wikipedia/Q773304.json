Despite the team getting 4 points out of a possible 6 under his stewardship, the club decided to replace McKinlay, just eight days into his tenure, with Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107. With Jokanovi\u0107 managing the team, Watford, on 25 April 2015, gained promotion to the Premier League after defeating Brighton 2\u20130 and other results going their way.

On 2 September, Watford confirmed the appointment of former Brighton & Hove Albion head coach \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda as the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow Championship side Leeds United for his services. Garc\u00eda, however, resigned from his position on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains a couple of weeks prior. Billy McKinlay, who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day \u2013 his first position in management. A week later, McKinlay was released by mutual consent and former Partizan coach Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107 appointed in his place, apparently because the club favoured a head coach with greater experience."]}, {"page": "Stab\u00e6k Fotball", "response": ["On 30 November 2015, Billy McKinlay was appointed as manager of the club on a two-year contract.
