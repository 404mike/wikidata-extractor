It was largely the idea of Cyril Kleinwort who realised that the government was paying much attention to the UK's balance of trade in goods, but little to the UK's invisible earnings from services. In 1984 Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick had become Chairman of the organisation by which time invisible earnings were accounting for a third of the UK's earnings. He stayed until 1991. On 19 October 1990 the organisation (registered as a company) became British Invisibles. In January 1998 it merged with CEENET, a company set up by the Corporation of London to promote financial services to Eastern Europe, and re-branded itself as BI.  It acquired a new Chief Executive, Jeremy Seddon, and a new Deputy Chief Executive, Henrietta Royle.  Charlie Haswell joined the executive team, and later the Board, on secondment from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to develop links with British Embassies and High Commissions around the world.  The company was a membership organisation and focused on running promotional events abroad for its members (primarily in the emerging markets), undertaking research on the performance of the financial services industry and providing the secretariat for financial services lobbying in the WTO.  BI became known as IFSL on 1 February 2001. Invisibles historically have consisted of services (financial and legal), investment income and transfers. The organisation has in the past published The City Table, giving the order of financial services companies."]}, {"page": "Patrick Edmund Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick", "response": ["#REDIRECT Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick"]}, {"page": "Pery", "response": ["* Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick (1930\u20132003), Irish peer and public servant"]}, {"page": "Edmund Pery, 7th Earl of Limerick", "response": ["Edmund Christopher Pery, 7th Earl of Limerick (born 10 February 1963), is an Anglo-Irish peer and son of Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick.
