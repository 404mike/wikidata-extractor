He was injured during their first match, a defeat away to Port Vale on 28 August 1920, and not recalled to the first team until mid-October, when he scored the first goal in a 2\u20130 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday. The Yorkshire Post described him as \"a tall, raw-boned player\" who \"proved himself an energetic opportunist. He lies well up the field, ready to snap at any chance that may come along, and in this way he obtained the first goal, after the ball had struck the cross-bar from a long drive by Walton, the half back.\" In his next match, he scored the only goal against Hull City with a header from a corner that gave Leeds the first away win of their League career. then had a mid-season run of 22 matches in which he scored 11 goalsincluding Leeds United's first League hat-trick, against Notts County on 11 December, and two goals in a 3\u20130 win against Wolverhampton Wanderersbefore losing his place to the newly arrived Tommy Howarth. The secretary stated that although the team had done well enough for a first season at Football League level, the club were aiming for a \"more representative place\" next season and were retaining players who could help achieve that; despite having finished as top scorer, Thompson was not among the chosen few."]}]}}
