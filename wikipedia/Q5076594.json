This was a by-election Shersby had not been expected to win since it took place in the depths of unpopularity of the Heath Government and on the same night that Shersby was elected to Parliament (7 December 1972) the Conservatives lost the considerably safer seat of Sutton and Cheam by a large majority after a huge swing against the party there to the Liberal party but in Uxbridge Shersby managed to hang on to a seat taken back from Labour for the Conservatives by Charles Curran in 1970, even though the majority fell from 1970's 3,646 votes to a rather less comfortable 1,178 votes that night.  His local roots as an Ickenham born lad probably helped him considerably in that election and over the years he consistently built up his majority to a high point of 15,970 votes in the 1987 general election by establishing a reputation as an extremely committed and hardworking backbench MP more interested in being able to pursue single issues he believed in rather than pursuing the trappings of power as a minister at what would have been the expense of his political independence."]}, {"page": "Uxbridge (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Charles Curran", "| Charles Curran"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Curran"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Curran"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Charles Curran"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Charles Curran"]}, {"page": "Charles Curran", "response": ["Charles Curran may refer to:", "* Charles Curran (broadcaster) (1921\u20131980), BBC Director-General 1969\u20131977", "* Charles Curran (politician) (1903\u20131972), British Conservative politician, MP for Uxbridge 1959\u20131966", "* Charles Curran (theologian) (born 1934), American Catholic moral theologian"]}, {"page": "In His Own Write", "response": ["One of the few negative responses to the book came from the Conservative Member of Parliament Charles Curran.
