In the 1932\u201333 season, Halliday made 41 out of a possible 42 appearances in the league, taking his total to 127 in senior competition. In May 1933, he and Darlington teammates Harry Brown, Billy Eden and Fred Hopkinson were members of the Rest of Durham XI that faced Sunderland in a match to celebrate the silver jubilee of the Durham County Football Association. Darlington had finished bottom of the Northern Section, so had to apply for re-election. Although their application was successful, Halliday left the club."]}, {"page": "Sam White (footballer)", "response": ["White was born in Newburn, Northumberland, the son of John White, an engineering fitter and turner, and his wife Barbara. At the time of the 1911 UK Census, the family was living in nearby Walbottle and the seven-year-old White was the fifth of nine surviving children. He played football for Newburn and for Annfield Plain before joining Second Division club Leeds United in May 1927. He played for Leeds' reserves in the Central League, but not for the first team, and moved on to Second Division Hull City a year later. Again, he never played for their first team, and after winger Billy Eden left for Sunderland in October 1929, Darlington signed White in his position. He scored twice from nine Third Division North matches, and was not retained at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "George Charlton", "response": ["Charlton made his Darlington debut in a 6\u20132 Third Division North defeat away to local rivals Hartlepools United on 23 September 1933, and did not appear again until the return fixture in February 1934, when the \"local product\" filled the vacancy left by the transfer of Harry Brown to Chesterfield. This time, he played what the Yorkshire Post described as a \"very satisfactory game\", scored as his team won 5\u20133, and played in four of the next five league matches before losing his place to Billy Eden. He moved on to Shildon. In his first season, he scored the winning goal in the Northern League Challenge Cup final, and was a regular in the team that won the 1934\u201335 Northern League title and reached the first round proper of the FA Cup. He helped Shildon win the title in each of the next two seasons, and was still with the club in 1939."]}]}}
