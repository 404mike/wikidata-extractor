In July 2020 it was announced King will be the attack coach at Gloucester Rugby. King attended Brighton College and Bristol University but started his rugby career with Hove.\nHe has been capped by England and the Barbarians. The former Rosslyn Park player joined Wasps in 1996 and helped them win the League that year. He scored a try on his England debut against Argentina in 1997 and made his first Test appearance at Twickenham as a replacement against South Africa in 1998. He scored a try and a drop goal as Wasps won the 1999 Anglo-Welsh Cup Final, and the following year he kicked three penalties as Wasps retained the cup.He earned his final cap against Wales in a World Cup warm up match in Cardiff in August 2003. However, an injury acquired during the game ultimately affected his selection prospects for the World Cup and he stayed at home. In the Zurich Premiership he had enjoyed a glittering climax to 2003, being 'man of the match' in the Premiership final and amassing 24 points, as Wasps beat Gloucester 39\u20133. He finished as the leading Premiership points scorer, including play offs, with 284 points. He was a kingpin of the Wasps team which won the Zurich Premiership and Heineken Cup double in the season 2003\u201304, scoring a drop goal in the Premiership final. The following season he helped Wasps complete a hat-trick of Premiership titles, again scoring a drop goal in the final.King won his second Heineken Cup with Wasps in 2007, in the final of which he scored four penalties and a drop goal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oliver's Twist", "response": ["| Oliver cooks a hearty meal including chicken cooked in milk for Wasps RFC players Mark Denney, Alex King, Fraser Waters and Lawrence Dallaglio."]}, {"page": "Wasps RFC", "response": ["Leicester Tigers were the favourites, as they had already won the Anglo-Welsh cup and the Guinness Premiership, the latter just the week before.
