Gaz Coombes, Goffey, and Quinn had been playing gigs around Oxford when they were spotted by producer Sam Williams, who said he wanted to work with them. Between the months of May and August, the band recorded a six track demo at Sawmills Studio and, having signed a deal with Backbeat Records, a limited number of copies of \"Caught by the Fuzz\" and \"Mansize Rooster\" were released. The demo had also quickly reached EMI, however, and that led to the group being signed by the Parlophone label, which would re-release the two songs. Quinn said \"it took about three and a half months total recording time and cost less to make than the video for Alright.\"", "\"Strange Ones\" and \"I'd Like to Know\" are both songs about the strange people on Cowley Road, Oxford. Mick Quinn tried to describe the concept: \"There's a few people who are just really out there. There's a lot of people around Oxford who are real spliffheads and that, who go and lie down in Port Meadow, but I'm not really sure about them. I'm not really sure that they're individuals: they're part of a much larger thing.\" Danny Goffey added, \"They're the sort of people who don't fit in anywhere, who don't link up with everyday life at all.\"", "Culturally, the album's glorification of teenage freedom made a very big impact on the overall Britpop music scene. The whole genre was seen as the voice of youth, but Supergrass, still teens themselves when the album was made, addressed the subject with more insight than most. The most well-known song from the album, \"Alright\", is still played regularly in Britain and Ireland, and held up as a musical example of teenage rebellion. Though it is one of their most popular songs, the band rarely play \"Alright\" in their live sets any more. In a 1999 interview, Gaz Coombes joked, \"We don't play 'Alright' anymore. We should play it in a minor key, and in the past tense.\"1999 interview with Johnathan Cohen from nudeasthenews.com Around the time of its release Coombes said that \"it wasn't written as an anthem.

It's meant to be light-hearted and a bit of a laugh, not at all a rebellious call to arms.\" Danny Goffey noted, \"It certainly wasn't written in a very summery vibe.

He grew sideburns and they [other pupils] gave him loads of shit, but I was really into him. I think I fancied him a bit, y'know? He's really beautiful. He wasn't very mature at that age.

Aside from their traditional instrumentation, the band used zithers, ukuleles, brass, strings, and a drum machine. The album's first single, \"St. Petersburg\", was recorded in one take and features no overdubs. Drummer Danny Goffey said of the album's more acoustic, streamlined recording: \"It was a kind of conscious decision to make an album that didn't have a three-minute single, something that had more of a mellow vibe about it. There have been those obscure tracks that have been on the albums that no one probably had heard, because people just buy our singles or see just what's on the charts or on the radio.
