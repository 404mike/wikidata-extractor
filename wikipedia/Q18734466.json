Besides Green himself, the first mathematician to quote his 1828 work was the Briton Robert Murphy (1806\u20131843) in his 1833 work. Green is mentioned in a footnote on p. 357. In 1845, four years after Green's death, Green's work was rediscovered by the young William Thomson (then aged 21), later known as Lord Kelvin, who popularised it for future mathematicians. According to the book \"George Green\" by D.M. Cannell, William Thomson noticed Murphy's citation of Green's 1828 essay but found it difficult to locate Green's 1828 work; he finally got some copies of Green's 1828 work from William Hopkins in 1845."]}, {"page": "Robert Murphy", "response": ["*Robert Murphy (footballer) (born 1982), Australian rules footballer with the Western Bulldogs", "*Robert Murphy (Australian politician) (1876\u20131966)", "*Robert Murphy (cinematographer) (born 1970), American cinematographer, see In Search of a Midnight Kiss and Meet Me in Montenegro", "*Robert Murphy (producer), British TV writer and producer, see Murder City, DCI Banks or Losing Gemma", "*Robert Murphy (mathematician), Irish mathematician"]}]}}
