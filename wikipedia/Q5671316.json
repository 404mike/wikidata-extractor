He was born and raised in Nelson, Lancashire and made two appearances in The Football League for his hometown club in the 1923\u201324 season. Aside from football, he was also a keen athlete, and worked in several cotton mills in east Lancashire.\nNutter played amateur football for Barnoldswick Town before joining Nelson in February 1924. He was originally planned only to have a trial for the reserve team at Nelson, but because regular goalkeeper Harry Abbott was injured, Nutter was selected for the Football League Second Division match away at South Shields on 9 February 1924. Nelson lost 0\u20133, the final goal scored from a penalty kick after a foul by Nutter. He made his second appearance for the club the following week, but Nelson lost again as Bury won 5\u20130.\nNutter was subsequently released from Nelson and gave up professional football. He joined Lancashire Constabulary, with whom he spent a year as a constable. On 5 November 1926 he emigrated to Australia aboard the ocean liner Demosthenes. He later lived in Kew, Victoria. It is believed that Nutter died in Victoria in 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1923\u201324 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Harry Nutter"]}, {"page": "Nutter (surname)", "response": ["* Harry Nutter (1901\u20131983), English footballer"]}]}}
