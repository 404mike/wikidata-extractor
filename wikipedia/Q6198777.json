He was involved with the design of electronic telephone exchanges in the 1960s and 1970s.  He was responsible for the  concept of both the TXE1 and TXE3 systems, which were reed switch-based electronic exchanges. The development of these exchanges was carried out by a consortium of British telecom manufacturers in conjunction with the General Post Office. The ideas in these exchanges were later developed, by others, into the TXE4 exchanges - which, at their peak in the early 1990s, catered for more than 25% of the UK subscribers.\nWarman was born at Westcombe Park in South London.  During World War II he served in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.\nHis career started off Siemens Brothers at Woolwich, and he remained there when Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) took over the company.  AEI was then taken over by the General Electric Company, who, in 1968, closed down the development of TXE exchanges in favour of crossbar switch systems.  All the AEI staff were sacked, including those on the TXE project.  Warman joined American company GTE International as European technical director based in Milan, taking with him some members of his  AEI team.  There, Warman persisted in basing his developments on reed electronic (analogue) principles, when it had already become clear that fully electronic digital switches were now the obvious path forward.  Some time later, GTE decided to close the development team in Europe.\nWarman received the Prince Philip Medal of The City and Guilds Institute in 1966.  He held over 100 patents.He returned to the UK and set up his own company, but it was not a success, and his health failed. He died in November 1984.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "TXE", "response": ["Siemens Brothers (later taken over by Associated Electrical Industries, who renamed each section accordingly e.g. AEI Telecoms) had set up an electronic switching lab at Blackheath. This lab was headed by John Flood, who had been a founder member of Tommy Flowers' electronic switching team at Dollis Hill. In the Siemens team was an engineer called Jim Warman. It was his trunking ideas (sectionalisation, serial trunking, line scanning, route choice, repeat attempt etc.), which were to be central to the development of the British TXE exchanges.", "During the development of the TXE3 it became apparent that the system would be too expensive for the competitive export market, so AEI split its team into two: one to do whatever the BPO wanted and the other to produce a reduced version for export. The trial was started in April 1968 and the model worked very well at Armour House and the BPO ordered the first half dozen exchanges. Jim Warman moved his team back from Blackheath to Woolwich to start a new department with its own manufacturing and marketing. The equipment for the first exchange had been manufactured with a 9,600 capacity and was being installed on site at Royal exchange in London in 1968 when GEC made a takeover bid for AEI.  The takeover bid was successful and GEC decided that they preferred the crossbar system to TXE3 and promptly cancelled the contract to supply TXE3 to the BPO. Royal first exchange was dismantled before its installation had been completed and all the TXE3 equipment was broken up and supplied to universities for observation."]}]}}
