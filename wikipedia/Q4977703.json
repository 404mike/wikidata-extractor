Hylton-Stewart was educated at Bath College, then went up to Peterhouse, Cambridge, with an organ scholarship. He was a right-handed lower or middle order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler.\nHe first appeared in first-class cricket in the Somerset match against the South Africans in 1912, when he replaced the injured Harry Chidgey after the game had started. Two weeks later, he made his only appearance of the 1912 season for Cambridge University, and then from mid-July appeared fairly regularly for Somerset for the rest of the season. His batting was not successful, but he had one sensational day as a bowler, taking five wickets for three runs in 14 balls against Worcestershire at Stourbridge: these remained the best bowling figures of his first-class cricket career.In 1913, Hylton-Stewart played 11 first-class matches, most of them in the second half of the season and all of them for Somerset. He took five wickets in an innings for a second time, this time five for 72 against Yorkshire at Park Avenue, Bradford. His batting improved as well, and he made his first score of more than 50, an unbeaten 72 against Sussex at Bath.The 1914 season was Hylton-Stewart's most successful as a batsman \u2013 he made 520 runs at an average of 20.80 per innings. After two matches for Cambridge in mid-season, he again played most of Somerset's matches in the second half of the year. Batting now in the middle order, he made his only first-class century, 110, made in 105 minutes out of an innings of 220, against Essex at Leyton. And late in the season, he made 91 against Worcestershire at Taunton.During the First World War Hylton-Stewart was commissioned in the British Army and served with school Officers' Training Corps (OTC), first at The Leys School and then at Haileybury. He remained with the Haileybury OTC until 1929 when he resigned his commission.Hylton-Stewart did not return to first-class cricket after the First World War but played Minor Counties cricket for Hertfordshire up to 1927.\nHylton-Stewart taught at Marlborough College 1934\u201354 and then was Director of Music and organist at St James's Church, Piccadilly, 1954\u201370. He died at Marlborough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club first-class matches", "response": ["All but six of the first-class matches played by Somerset have been eleven-a-side.

In 1912, the club made a loss of \u00a3327, and they could not persuade Daniell to remain at the club rather than travel to India. Initially the county asked Arthur Newton, who was at that time 50 years old, to serve as captain, but after consideration he declined the role, and Poyntz was appointed instead. The team that he inherited remained a poor one: the Wisden summary in 1913 stated that they had, \"no temptation to deal at any great length with the doings of Somerset\".Roebuck (1991), p. 109. During a season in which his side had finished bottom of the championship with only two wins, Poyntz scored 363 runs at an average of 15.12, with a single half-century; 50 runs exactly scored against Derbyshire. The club once again recorded a loss during the season, and at the club's annual general meeting, the mood was negative. Despite this, Poyntz was reappointed as captain for 1914 after a proposal made by Bruce Hylton-Stewart and seconded by Newton. Rare optimism was shown by Newton and Poyntz, with the latter claiming that it was due to \"a lot of bad luck that they [Somerset] did not finish half way up the table instead of at the bottom.\"Roebuck (1991), p. 112."]}, {"page": "Charles Henry Hylton Stewart", "response": ["His second son, Bruce Hylton-Stewart, played first-class cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club and appears generally to have used a hyphen in his surname."]}, {"page": "Charles Hylton Stewart", "response": ["His brother was Bruce Hylton-Stewart."]}, {"page": "Bruce Stewart", "response": ["*Bruce Hylton-Stewart (1891\u20131972), played first-class cricket for Somerset and Cambridge University between 1912 and 1914"]}, {"page": "Royalton Kisch", "response": ["In 1940 Kisch married Aline, n\u00e9e Hylton Stewart, the cellist daughter of Bruce Hylton-Stewart and niece of Charles Hylton Stewart.
