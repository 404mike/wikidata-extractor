The group consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Jamie Cook (guitar, keyboards), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.", "The Arctic Monkeys were formed in mid-2002 by friends Alex Turner, Matt Helders, and Andy Nicholson. Turner and Helders were neighbours and close friends, and they met Nicholson in secondary school. Turner, who had grown up in a musical household as his father was a music teacher, played guitar in the then-instrumental-only band, with Helders on drums, Nicholson on bass, and a new band member, Jamie Cook as a second guitarist. Initially, Turner was reluctant when it came to being the lead singer. As time passed, Turner became the lead singer and frontman of the band as he had \"a thing for words\", according to Helders. The band began rehearsing at Yellow Arch Studios in Neepsend and played its first gig on 13 June 2003 at The Grapes in Sheffield city centre. After a few performances in 2003, the band began to record demos at 2fly studios in Sheffield. 18 songs were demoed in all and the collection, now known as Beneath the Boardwalk, was burned onto CDs to give away at gigs, which were promptly file-shared amongst fans. The name Beneath the Boardwalk originated when the first batch of demos were sent around. The first sender, wanting to classify the demos, named them after where he received them, the Boardwalk. Slowly, as more demos were spread, they were all classified under this name. This has led to many people falsely believing that Beneath the Boardwalk was an early album, or that the early demos were all released under this title. The group did not mind the distribution, saying \"we never made those demos to make money or anything. We were giving them away free anyway \u2013 that was a better way for people to hear them.\"", "* Jamie Cook \u2013 guitar (2002\u2013present), keyboards, lap steel guitar (2017\u2013present), backing vocals (2002\u20132007)"]}, {"page": "List of guitarists", "response": ["*Jamie Cook (Arctic Monkeys)"]}, {"page": "List of Telecaster players", "response": ["* Jamie Cook (born 1985) is the guitarist of Arctic Monkeys and used the Fender Telecaster reissue from 2005 to 2008."]}, {"page": "Five Minutes with Arctic Monkeys", "response": ["*Jamie Cook \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Electro-Harmonix", "response": ["*Jamie Cook: Big Muff, Little Big Muff, Pulsar, HOG Foot Controller, Deluxe Memory Man, Holiest Grail"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Jamie Cook, musician, guitarist for the Arctic Monkeys"]}, {"page": "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor", "response": ["* Jamie Cook \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Alex Turner", "response": ["At the age of 15, Turner's weekends revolved around girls and drinking cider with his friends. Joe Carnall, a schoolfriend, has said Turner was \"always the quiet one\" in their social circle. After friends began forming bands and playing live, Turner, Helders, and Nicholson decided to start Arctic Monkeys in mid-2002. According to Nicholson, Turner already had \"instruments about the house\" and was conversant in the basics of musicianship because of his father's job as a music teacher. Helders bought a drum kit, while Turner suggested that Nicholson learn bass guitar, and invited Jamie Cook, a neighbour who attended a different school, to play guitar. Initially, Turner played guitar in the instrumental band; he became the frontman when two other school friends declined to sing. Helders considered Turner the obvious candidate for lyricist \u2013 \"I knew he had a thing for words\" \u2013 and he gradually began to share songs with his bandmates. Before playing a live show, the band rehearsed for a year in Turner's garage and, later, at an unused warehouse in Wath. According to Helders' mother, who drove the teenagers to and from their rehearsal space three times a week: \"If they knew you were there, they would just stop so we had to sneak in.\" Their first gig was on Friday, 13 June 2003, supporting The Sound at a local pub called The Grapes. The set, which was partly recorded, comprised four original songs and four cover versions of songs by The Beatles, The White Stripes, The Undertones, and The Datsuns."]}, {"page": "When the Sun Goes Down (Arctic Monkeys song)", "response": ["*Jamie Cook \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not", "response": ["* Jamie Cook \u2013 rhythm and lead guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Katie Downes", "response": ["She began dating the Arctic Monkeys guitarist Jamie Cook in 2006.Maxim, August 2007 cover girl with caption \"Arctic Monkey's girl naked!\" They became engaged in 2012 and were married in May 2014."]}, {"page": "Jamie", "response": ["* Jamie Cook (born 1985), guitarist for British band Arctic Monkeys"]}, {"page": "Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?", "response": ["* Jamie Cook \u2013 rhythm and lead guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Leave Before the Lights Come On", "response": ["* Jamie Cook \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar"]}, {"page": "List of rhythm guitarists", "response": ["*Jamie Cook (Arctic Monkeys)"]}, {"page": "Arctic Monkeys discography", "response": ["English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys have released 6 studio albums, 5 extended plays (EPs) and 23 singles.
