Its media profile greatly eclipsed that of UKIP. Goldsmith also used his financial resources to deliver a videocassette to five million UK households in March 1997. This was a novel strategy in British politics, and was conceived as a way of reaching the electorate while bypassing the mass media. The packaging of the videocassette did not specify that it was produced by the Referendum Party but rather carried several slogans: \"The most important video you'll ever watch\", \"The story the politicians don't want you to hear\", and \"If you care about Britain, please pass this video on.\" The 12-minute film, presented by the former That's Life! presenter Gavin Campbell, warned of a coming \"federal European super-state\". In his analysis of the video, scholar David Hass argued that the film was deliberately designed to elicit fear in the viewer, something achieved through \"eerie sound effects\", the image of a blue stain spreading across a map of Europe, and slow-motion shots of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl striding towards the screen. In Hass' view, the film \"manifestly reduced that complex issue of Europe to the lowest common denominator, and aimed to shock.\""]}, {"page": "That's Life!", "response": ["*Gavin Campbell (1982\u20131994)"]}, {"page": "Softly, Softly (TV series)", "response": ["| Gavin Campbell ||  PC/DC William Digby || 1968-1969 || 3-5 || 25"]}, {"page": "St Christopher School, Letchworth", "response": ["*Gavin Campbell, actor, TV presenter and businessman"]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members", "response": ["* Gavin Campbell"]}, {"page": "Gavin Campbell", "response": ["Gavin Campbell may refer to:", "* Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane (1851\u20131922), Scottish nobleman and Liberal politician", "* Gavin Campbell, lead guitarist with Australian rock band 67 Special", "* Gavin Campbell (music producer), Australian DJ and remixer", "* Gavin Campbell (presenter) (born 1946), businessman and former television presenter", "* Gavin Campbell (Home and Away), fictional character on the Australian soap opera Home and Away"]}, {"page": "The Playbirds", "response": ["* Gavin Campbell ...
