However, the Rupp/Watson study of Luther and Erasmus chose \"free choice\" as the translation and provided a rationale.Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson, Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation (Westminister, 1969), 29. Luther used \"free choice\" (or \"free-will\") to denote the fact that humans act \"spontaneously\" and with \"a desirous willingness.\"Henry Cole, trans, Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 60 He also allowed \"Free-will\" as that \"power\" by which humans \"can be caught by the Spirit\" of God.63BOWCole However, he deplored the use of the term \"Free-will\" because it is too \"grand, copious, and full.\" Therefore, Luther held that the inborn faculty of \"willingness\" should be \"called by some other term.\"Henry Cole, trans, Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 64.", "To use a biblical word important to Luther, to be set free from sin and for righteousness requires a metanoia.Treadwell Walden, The Great Meaning of the Word Metanoia: Lost in the Old Version, Unrecovered in the New (Thomas Whittaker, 1896), 26, footnote #1. Available online in Google Books. Luther used Jesus' image of the good and bad trees to depict the necessity of changing the person to change what a person wills and does. In Jesus' image, \"a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit\" (Matthew 7:18).Steven D. Paulson, Luther for the Armchair Theologians (Westminster John Knox, 2004), 9. Like the bad tree that can only produce bad fruit, before a rebirth through faith, people are in bondage to the sinful desires of their hearts. They can only will to do sin, albeit \"spontaneously and with a desirous willingness.\"Erwin Lutzer, The Doctrines That Divide: A Fresh Look at the Historic Doctrines That Separate Christians (Kregel, 1998), 172-173. Given his view of the human condition, Luther concluded that, without a rebirth, the \"free choice\" that all humans possess is \"not free at all\" because it cannot of itself free itself from its inherent bondage to sin.Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation, edited by Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson (Westminister, 1969), 141.", "Thus, Luther distinguished between different kinds of freedom: (a) by nature, a freedom to act as we will and (b) by rebirth through faith, a freedom to act righteously.Martin Luther, \"On the Bondage of the Will\" (1525), in Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation, edited by Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson (Westminister, 1969, reissued by Westminster John Knox, 2006), 27, 141.", "| For Calvin, humanity possesses \"free will,\"John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, trans.
