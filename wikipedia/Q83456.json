He was also named in the all-star squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the only English player to make the team.\nTerry is Chelsea's most successful captain. During his 19 years with the club, he led them to five Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one UEFA Europa League and one UEFA Champions League title. He is one of five players to have made over 500 appearances for Chelsea and is also the club's all-time highest scoring defender. In 2007, he became the first captain to lift the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium in Chelsea's 1\u20130 win over Manchester United, and also the first player to score an international goal there, scoring a header in England's 1\u20131 draw with Brazil. In his final season at Chelsea in 2017, he became the first ever player to captain a team to the Premier League title on five occasions.\nFollowing his departure from Chelsea, Terry spent one season with Aston Villa in the Championship before retiring, ultimately losing the 2018 Championship play-off final.
