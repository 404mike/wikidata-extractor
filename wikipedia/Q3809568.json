From about 1525 he was organist at St Paul's Cathedral (succeeding Thomas Hickman). He was choirmaster there from 1531 until his death in 1547. Many of his works are represented in the Mulliner Book.\nRedford is notable as one of the earliest composers, rather than improvisers, of organ music, having notated a significant quantity of keyboard music, all of it liturgical in function, based on plainchant melodies; a few vocal works by him also survive.As he held the post of Almoner and Master of the Choristers, Redford was responsible for the arrangement of the choristers performances, including writing and directing plays and interludes. The most celebrated of these entertainments is the morality play, The Play of Wyt and Science (written ca 1530-1550), which exists in one manuscript in the British Library (MS 15233). However, the first five pages of the manuscript are missing; there is no way to know how much is lost.Redford also wrote a number of poems, including the 23 verse Nolo mortem peccatoris, which was set to music by Thomas Morley, who was a later organist at St Paul's. Another poem is The Chorister's Lament, in which choirboys complain of the cruel beatings meted out to them:\nWe have a cursyd master, I tell you all for trew\nso cruell as he is was never Turke or Jue.\nhe is the most unhappiest man that ever ye knewe,\nfor to poor syllye boyes he wurkyth much woe.\nDo we never so well, he can never be content,\nbut for our good wylles we ever more be shente [punished],\nofttimes our lytle butokes he dooth all to rent,\nthat we, poore sylye boyes, abyde much woe.\nWe have many lasshes to lerne this peelde [wretched] song,\nthat I wyll not lye to you now & then among;\nout of our butokes we may plucke the stumpes thus long\nthat we, poore sylye boyes, abyde much woe.\nRedford's will (dated 7 Oct., proved 29 Nov. 1547) is published in the Records of Early English Drama. It states that he lived with his sister Margaret Coxe, most likely in the Almoner's House located on the south side of St. Paul's cathedral.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Morality play", "response": ["Whereas the didactic elements pre-Reformation morality plays usually reinforced the practices or doctrines of medieval Catholicism (often focusing on sacraments like penance), the post-Reformation morality plays\u2014when they concerned themselves with religious doctrine, rather than more secular concerns about education or good living (as with John Redford's Play of Wit and Science) -- sometimes worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church.  Although many post-Reformation morality plays were often like their predecessors in that they also were concerned with the salvation of its audience (and in their tendency to allow playful depictions of vice to eclipse those concerns), they differed in that they believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual\u2019s moral behaviour to concern for the individual's theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of Protestantism which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature.  The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calder\u00f3n.."]}, {"page": "St Paul's Cathedral", "response": ["Many distinguished musicians have been organists, choir masters and choristers at St Paul's Cathedral, including the composers John Redford, Thomas Morley, John Blow, Jeremiah Clarke, Maurice Greene and John Stainer, while well-known performers have included Alfred Deller, John Shirley-Quirk and Anthony Way as well as the conductors Charles Groves and Paul Hillier and the poet Walter de la Mare."]}, {"page": "1547 in literature", "response": ["*October or November \u2013 John Redford, English composer, poet and playwright (born c. 1500)"]}, {"page": "List of Renaissance composers", "response": ["*John Redford (c. 1486 \u2013 1547), one of the main contributors to The Mulliner Book"]}, {"page": "List of organ composers", "response": ["* John Redford"]}, {"page": "1540s in music", "response": ["* 1547: October or November \u2013 John Redford, English composer, poet and playwright (born c. 1500)"]}, {"page": "The Mulliner Book", "response": ["Of the 121 keyboard pieces over half are based on Catholic liturgical chants, and most of the rest are transcriptions of part songs and anthems, some twenty or so of which are secular.
