Sutter had missed the only ship outbound for Alta California, and had to remain in the Kingdom for four months.Dillion (1967), p. 70. Over the months Sutter gained friendly relations with the Euro-American community, dining with the Consuls of the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, John Coffin Jones and Richard Charlton, along with merchants such as American Faxon Atherton. The brig Clementine was eventually hired by Sutter to take freight provisions and general merchandise for New Archangel (now known as Sitka), the capital of the Russian-American Company colonies in Russian America. Joining the crew as unpaid supercargo, Sutter, 10 Native Hawaiian laborers, and several other followers embarked on April 20, 1839.Dillion (1967), pp. 72-73. Staying at New Archangel for a month, Sutter joined several balls hosted by Governor Kupreyanov, who likely gave help in determining the course of the Sacramento River. The Clementine then sailed for Alta California, arriving on July 1, 1839, at Yerba Buena (now San Francisco), which at that time was only a small seaport town."]}, {"page": "John Owen Dominis", "response": ["In 1837 the captain moved his wife and son from New York to Honolulu, Hawaii, leaving their two daughters at boarding school where they died young. King Kamehameha III awarded some land to the family in 1842 as settlement of a lawsuit with the British Consul Richard Charlton. The captain continued to take voyages to raise money for the construction of a large house. In 1846 he sailed for China on the Brig William Neilson, intending to purchase Chinese-made furniture for the house which was nearing completion. The ship was lost at sea, along with the American Agent George Brown, and Mary became a widow. Mary rented a suite of rooms to support herself and young John Owen. One of the first boarders established the American Legation in the house and named it \"Washington Place\". It was used as a governor's residence and is now a museum."]}, {"page": "Kamehameha III", "response": ["Kamehameha III also presided over formalization of the court system and land titles.  Cases such as those of Richard Charlton and Ladd & Co. had prompted the incidents of 1843 and subsequent litigation.  Under Kamehameha III, Hawaii rapidly transitioned from indigenous traditions to a new legal system based on Anglo-American common law.  Lorrin Andrews became a judge for foreign cases in 1845. William Little Lee (the first to actually graduate from law school) became first Chief Justice."]}, {"page": "Richard Charlton (Hawaii)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Charlton"]}, {"page": "List of diplomats from the United Kingdom to Hawaii", "response": ["*Richard Charlton, from 1824 to 1843"]}, {"page": "Mary Dominis", "response": ["In Honolulu, the Dominises started building a mansion, on lands near the residence of the British consul to Hawaii Richard Charlton. Between 1841 and 1847, the construction details of the mansion were largely attended to by Mary since Captain Dominis was mostly away on voyages raising money for the building cost. Honolulu had become the political and business capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom, as during the mid-1840s, King Kamehameha III relocated the government from Lahaina, establishing his residence at \u02bbIolani Palace on adjacent property facing the Dominis property.

On September 28, 1840, American Protestant missionary Reverend Cochran Forbes complained about her adherence to the Roman Catholic faith.

She will probably become a papist as she is unwilling to abandon her lusts.\" Her former husband Kalanimoku had also been baptized a Roman Catholic but later joined the Protestant church. In 1841, she was noted as the \"chief woman\" in Kealakekua, Hawaii and in 1845, she made a deposition in the case of Richard Charlton.
