He turned professional at the club shortly before Christmas 1940 and received a \u00a310 signing-on fee, which the cash-strapped club had to pay in instalments. On Christmas morning he played for Bradford PA, then guested for Huddersfield Town in the afternoon, and scored in both matches. In the wartime leagues he scored a total of 171 goals in league and cup 209 appearances for Bradford PA. He became a Bevin Boy in order to avoid his call-up for national service in 1945 as he did not want to miss the resumption of the Football League, but found the experience of coal mining terrifying and gruelling. He began to avoid his shifts in the pits, and so was called into the Royal Air Force, where he served the remainder of his national service. He scored four goals in seven Second Division matches at the start of the 1946\u201347 season, but left the club in October 1946 after growing tired of heckling from his own supporters who did not appreciate his individualist style."]}, {"page": "Peter Doherty (footballer)", "response": ["After the conclusion of the war, he transferred to Derby County, with whom he won the FA Cup, scoring a goal in the final itself as Derby beat Charlton Athletic 4\u20131 at Wembley Stadium. In December 1946, Doherty moved to David Steele's Huddersfield Town for a fee of over \u00a39,000 after requesting a transfer. Doherty was unhappy with the directors who opposed his plan to secure his future by taking over the Arboretum Hotel and an earlier dispute over FA Cup Final tickets. The \"Terriers\" boasted a powerful front five of Albert Bateman, Jimmy Glazzard, Alf Whittingham, Doherty and Vic Metcalfe. However a weak defence saw them struggle in the lower reaches of the First Division throughout the 1946\u201347 season, 1947\u201348 and 1948\u201349 seasons. At Leeds Road he scored 33 goals in 83 league appearances, finishing as the \"Terriers\" top-scorer in his final two seasons under George Stephenson."]}]}}
