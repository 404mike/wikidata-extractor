Raven wrote his 1942 biography of Ray, seeing him as the senior partner and saying that Willughby had \"less knowledge, patience and judgment\" than Ray, whom he considered a scientist of genius,Raven (1942) p. 336. and whose contributions he tended to compare favourably with the achievements of most other writers. Raven was unaware of the Willughby family archive at the University of Nottingham when he wrote his book,Birkhead (2018) pp. vii\u2013viii. and access to that and other new material have led to modern appraisals giving a more balanced picture, with the two men seen to have made significant individual contributions, each demonstrating his own strengths.Birkhead (2018) pp. 267\u2013268."]}, {"page": "William Turner (naturalist)", "response": ["Turner embraced the transmutation of species.

Oxford University Press, 2000  (p. 432).Lyn Smith, Voices against War : A Century of Protest. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing, 2009.  (pp. 63\u201364). For the first two years of its existence, it was known as the No More War International Movement. It became the British section of War Resisters International. Chaired by Fenner Brockway, it asked members to strive for revolutionary socialism but not to take part in any war. Other notable NMWM members included Wilfred Wellock,Michael Pugh, Liberal Internationalism: The Interwar Movement for Peace in Britain. Palgrave Macmillan, 2012.  (p. 94). Leslie Paul,Leslie Paul, Angry Young Man. Faber, 1951. (pp. 204, 284). A. Barratt Brown, Leyton Richards, W. J. Chamberlain and Monica Whately. \"Whateley, Monica Mary BA, (1890-1960)\" in Cheryl Law, Women, a modern political dictionary. London, I.B. Tauris, 2000.  (p.154). Nigel Copsey and Andrzej Olechnowicz, Varieties of Anti-Fascism: Britain in the Inter-War Period Palgrave Macmillan 2010.  (p. 108). The movement also received messages of support from several international figures, including Albert Einstein.Otto Nathan, Heinz Norden, Einstein on Peace. Simon and Schuster, 1960. (p. 91). In 1926, a member proposed the creation of a white poppy, in the manner of the British Legion's red poppies, but with the added meaning of a hope for an end to all wars. The group did not pursue the idea, but it was later taken up by the Women's Co-operative Guild.Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations At its peak, the NMWM numbered around 3000 members, many from the Independent Labour Party. In 1929, several prominent British intellectuals signed a statement, \"Why I Believe in the No More War Movement\", supporting the NMWM's aims.W. J. Chamberlain, Fighting for Peace: The Story of the War Resistance Movement, London, 1929. Among the signatories were: Harold Laski, Frederick Soddy, H. M. Swanwick, Margaret Llewelyn Davies, Herbert Henry Elvin, John Scurr, Tom Williams, Evelyn Sharp, Emily Phipps, Canon Charles E. Raven, Rhys J. Davies, Hamilton Fyfe, the Marquis of Tavistock, Barbara Ayrton-Gould and Alfred Salter. The group published two journals: The New World and No More War."]}, {"page": "Ian Ramsey", "response": ["Ramsey was born in Kearsley, near Bolton, Lancashire, an area noted for small industries and factories. He was the sole child born to Arthur and Mary Ramsey, and was raised by them in the Christian faith. He attended primary school at St John's Church in Farnworth, Bolton, and then proceeded on a scholarship to Farnworth Grammar School where he studied Latin, mathematics, physics and chemistry. He won a scholarship that enabled him to study at Cambridge University in the 1930s and graduated with an MA in 1940. At Cambridge, he was influenced by Charles E. Raven (Regius Professor of Divinity) and A. C. Ewing. Raven spurred Ramsey's interests in the relationship between science and religion, while Ewing guided him into studying metaphysics."]}]}}
