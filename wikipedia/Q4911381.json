He also had a spell playing for Maidstone United before becoming player-manager of South African outfit Durban City.\nAfter spending around five years at Durban City, Williams went to manage in America spending a year each at Sacramento Gold and the Atlanta Chiefs. After returning to England in 1981 Williams took over at the original Maidstone United, spending three years at the club before agreeing to move back to South Africa to manage Durban United. In 1986 Williams again took over the reins at Maidstone before becoming general manager of the club from 1987\u20131991. After the sacking of Graham Carr in 1991, Williams became Maidstone first team manager for the third time but lasted only a matter of months before being replaced by Clive Walker. In 1997 Williams took the manager's job at Dover Athletic and led the club to their highest ever league finish when the club came 6th in the Football Conference in the 1999\u20132000 season. After leaving Dover in 2001 Williams spent a short time managing Kingstonian.\nWilliams has since returned to the re-formed Maidstone United and has been a key member of the club for a number of years. He is currently Chief Executive and Director of Football and played a major role in moving the club to the Gallagher Stadium after 24 years of homelessness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dover Athletic F.C.", "response": ["Bill Williams took over as manager in 1997 and led the club to the FA Trophy semi-finals in the 1997\u201398 season and a best league finish to date of sixth place in the 1999\u20132000 season.  Williams left the club to take a senior position with Conference rivals Kingstonian in May 2001.  By now the club was in severe financial difficulties, with a number of directors resigning and debts exceeding \u00a3100,000.  Amid the crisis the entire board of directors resigned, forcing the club's Supporters' Trust to take over the running of the club, and manager Gary Bellamy was sacked after just six months in the job.  Former Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall took over but was dismissed just three months later, with Clive Walker taking over in March 2002 with the club rooted to the foot of the table.  The club finished the season bottom of the Conference and was relegated back to the Southern League Premier Division.
