Born in South Africa, Kohler made a name for herself as a Shakespearean actor in England. She is a graduate of Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, of which she is an Associate Member, and was nominated a Laurence Olivier Award in 2000 for her performance as Paulina in the Barbican Centre's production of The Winter's Tale (1999 season). She is also remembered for her performance as Hilary Nash (later Main) in the TV series The Main Chance, opposite John Stride. Her voice is featured in several audio books by Naxos Audiobooks.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Titus Andronicus", "response": ["A celebrated, and unedited production, (according to Jonathan Bate, not a single line from Q1 was cut) was directed by Deborah Warner in 1987 at The Swan and remounted at Barbican's Pit in 1988 for the RSC, starring Brian Cox as Titus, Estelle Kohler as Tamora, Peter Polycarpou as Aaron and Sonia Ritter as Lavinia. Met with almost universally positive reviews, Jonathan Bate regards it as the finest production of any Shakespearean play of the entire 1980s.Bate (1996: 1) Using a small cast, Warner had her actors address the audience from time to time throughout the play and often had actors leave the stage and wander out into the auditorium. Opting for a realist presentation, the play had a warning posted in the pit \"This play contains scenes which some people may find disturbing,\" and numerous critics noted how, after the interval at many shows, empty seats had appeared in the audience.An extensive overview of this production can be found in Dessen (1989: 57\u201370) Warner's production was considered so successful, both critically and commercially, that the RSC did not stage the play again until 2003.Hughes (2006: 47n1)"]}, {"page": "The Two Gentlemen of Verona", "response": ["Ten years later, in 1970, Robin Phillips' RSC production starred Peter Egan as Valentine, Ian Richardson as Proteus, Helen Mirren as Julia, Estelle Kohler as Silvia, and Patrick Stewart as Launce. This production concentrated on the issues of friendship and treachery, and set the play in a decadent world of social elitism. Valentine and Proteus were presented as aristocratic students, the Duke was a Don, and Eglamour an old scout master. On the other hand, the poverty-stricken outlaws were dressed in animal skins."]}, {"page": "Sebastian Shaw (actor)", "response": ["Shaw died of natural causes on 23 December 1994 at age 89 in Brighton, Sussex, England. A memorial service was held on 15 February 1995 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, commonly known as the Actors' Church due to its long association with the theatre community. Actors Ian Richardson and Ben Kingsley read works by William Shakespeare, stage actress Estelle Kohler read How Do I Love Thee? by Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, actress Sheila Allen read Life by Welsh poet George Herbert and actor Kenneth Branagh read from the works of Canon Henry Scott Holland. One of Shaw's own poems, Gemini, was also read. Baritone Stephen Varcoe sang  by Johannes Brahms, accompanied by Graham Johnson on the piano, and guitarist Martin Best performed and sang his composition of Ariel's Songs from The Tempest.
