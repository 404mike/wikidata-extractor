The proponents of this definition are almost always musicians who create their music expressly for these purposes.Steven Halpern, New Age Voice Magazine, June 1999 issue To be useful for meditation, music must have repetitive dynamic and texture without sudden loud chords or improvisation, which could disturb the meditator. It is minimalist in conception, and musicians in the genre are mostly instrumentalists rather than vocalists. Subliminal messages are also used in new-age music, and the use of instruments along with sounds of animals (like whales, wolves and eagles) and nature (waterfalls, ocean waves, rain) is also popular. Flautist Dean Evenson was one of the first musicians to combine peaceful music with the sounds of nature, launching a genre that became popular for massage and yoga.  Other prominent artists who create new-age music expressly for healing or meditation include Irv Teibel, Paul Horn, Deuter, Steven Halpern, Paul Winter, Lawrence Ball, Karunesh, Krishna Das, Deva Premal, Bhagavan Das, and Snatam Kaur."]}, {"page": "Lifehouse (rock opera)", "response": ["* 2012: Method Music released by Lawrence Ball"]}, {"page": "Lifehouse Chronicles", "response": ["===By Lawrence Ball==="]}, {"page": "Endless Wire (The Who album)", "response": ["*Lawrence Ball\u00a0\u2013 electronic music on \"Fragments\"", "*Richard Evans\u00a0\u2013 Design and art direction utilising elements created with the Visual Harmony software designed by Dave Snowdon and Lawrence Ball."]}, {"page": "Meditation music", "response": ["Modern meditation music in the 20th century began when composers such as John Cage, Stuart Dempster, Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley, La Monte Young and Lawrence Ball began to combine meditation techniques and concepts, and music.
