He was known for playing guitar on their only major hit \"Driver's Seat\", for which he also provided the opening guitar riff, as credited by former bandmate Laurence \"Loz\" Netto in a 2005 interview with Lars Hindsley.Born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England, he had appeared on Wild Turkey's 1972 album, Turkey, as a guitarist and vocalist; on Tim Rose's 1975 LP The Musician; and on Snips' 1978 LP Video King; before joining Sniff 'n' the Tears.After Sniff 'n' the Tears, Dyche played live and recorded with a range of bands and musicians, including the Pat Travers Band, Noel McCalla, John Illsley, The Hank Wangford Band and The Maddy Prior Band.  He also rejoined Glenn Cornick's band Wild Turkey, for some time circa 2006, and, more recently, he played with the Burton upon Trent-based band Mona Leeza.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sniff 'n' the Tears", "response": ["A few years later, Luigi Salvoni, the drummer from a band called Moon, listened to some demos that he and Roberts had cut in about 1975 for a French record label. Hearing some potential in them, he contacted Roberts about approaching Chiswick Records for a deal. Sniff 'n' The Tears subsequently debuted in 1977 as a six-piece band, consisting of Paul Roberts (vocals, acoustic guitar), Loz Netto (guitars), Mick Dyche (guitars), Chris Birkin (bass), Alan Fealdman (keyboards), and Luigi Salvoni (drums & percussion). This line-up recorded the band's first album, Fickle Heart, which was produced by Salvoni. Though recorded in 1978, the album sat unreleased for over a year because Chiswick were in the process of changing their distribution. The band then had a substantial international hit with Fickle Heart's lead single \"Driver's Seat\" in 1979, aided by its driving rhythm, catchy lyrics and a Moog solo contributed by guest musician Keith Miller. However, the band fractured almost immediately after the album's release; in a matter of months, Birkin, Fealdman, and Salvoni all left the group to pursue other interests.", "*Mick Dyche (guitars) 1978\u201381", "  bar:Mick       text:Mick Dyche"]}, {"page": "Pat Travers", "response": ["Pat Thrall, Nicko McBrain, Clive Edwards, Mick Dyche, Tommy Aldridge, Peter \"Mars\" Cowling, Barry Dunaway, Jerry Riggs, Gunter Nezhoda, Carmine Appice, Michael Shrieve, Aynsley Dunbar, Kirk McKim, Sandy Gennaro, Rodney O'Quinn, Sean Shannon and Frank McDaniel are some of the noted musicians who have been members of the Pat Travers Band through the years."]}, {"page": "Driver's Seat", "response": ["The genesis of the song dates back to 1973 and a demo tape recorded for a French record label by singer/guitarist Paul Roberts for the band Ashes of Moon.
