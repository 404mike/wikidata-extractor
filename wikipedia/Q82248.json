Conrad Korzemowin\" (per the certificate of discharge) debarked. When the Torrens had left Adelaide on 13 March 1893, the passengers had included two young Englishmen returning from Australia and New Zealand: 25-year-old lawyer and future novelist John Galsworthy; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson, who was going to help his father run a boys' preparatory school at Elstree. They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship; he would remain in touch with both. The protagonist of one of Galsworthy's first literary attempts, \"The Doldrums\" (1895\u201396), the first mate Armand, is obviously modelled on Conrad. At Cape Town, where the Torrens remained from 17 to 19 May, Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines. Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad. Later that year, Conrad would visit his relatives in Poland and Ukraine once again.", "Financial success long eluded Conrad, who often requested advances from magazine and book publishers, and loans from acquaintances such as John Galsworthy. Eventually a government grant (\"civil list pension\") of \u00a3100 per annum, awarded on 9 August 1910, somewhat relieved his financial worries, and in time collectors began purchasing his manuscripts. Though his talent was early on recognised by English intellectuals, popular success eluded him until the 1913 publication of Chance, which is often considered one of his weaker novels.", "He more frequently wrote about life at sea and in exotic parts than about life on British land because\u2014unlike, for example, his friend John Galsworthy, author of The Forsyte Saga\u2014he knew little about everyday domestic relations in Britain.  When Conrad's The Mirror of the Sea was published in 1906 to critical acclaim, he wrote to his French translator:  \"The critics have been vigorously swinging the censer to me.... Behind the concert of flattery, I can hear something like a whisper:  'Keep to the open sea!  Don't land!'  They want to banish me to the middle of the ocean.\"  Writing to his friend Richard Curle, Conrad remarked that \"the public mind fastens on externals\" such as his \"sea life\", oblivious to how authors transform their material \"from particular to general, and appeal to universal emotions by the temperamental handling of personal experience\".", "Conrad claimed that he \"never kept a diary and never owned a notebook.\" John Galsworthy, who knew him well, described this as \"a statement which surprised no one who knew the resources of his memory and the brooding nature of his creative spirit.\" Nevertheless, after Conrad's death, Richard Curle published a heavily modified version of Conrad's diaries describing his experiences in the Congo;", "The singularity of the universe depicted in Conrad's novels, especially compared to those of near-contemporaries like his friend and frequent benefactor John Galsworthy, is such as to open him to criticism similar to that later applied to Graham Greene. But where \"Greeneland\" has been characterised as a recurring and recognisable atmosphere independent of setting, Conrad is at pains to create a sense of place, be it aboard ship or in a remote village; often he chose to have his characters play out their destinies in isolated or confined circumstances. In the view of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis, it was not until the first volumes of Anthony Powell's sequence, A Dance to the Music of Time, were published in the 1950s, that an English novelist achieved the same command of atmosphere and precision of language with consistency, a view supported by later critics like A. N. Wilson; Powell acknowledged his debt to Conrad. Leo Gurko, too, remarks, as \"one of Conrad's special qualities, his abnormal awareness of place, an awareness magnified to almost a new dimension in art, an ecological dimension defining the relationship between earth and man.\"", "After the publication of Chance in 1913, Conrad was the subject of more discussion and praise than any other English writer of the time. He had a genius for companionship, and his circle of friends, which he had begun assembling even prior to his first publications, included authors and other leading lights in the arts, such as Henry James, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, John Galsworthy, Edward Garnett, Garnett's wife Constance Garnett (translator of Russian literature), Stephen Crane, Hugh Walpole, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells (whom Conrad dubbed \"the historian of the ages to come\"), Arnold Bennett, Norman Douglas, Jacob Epstein, T. E. Lawrence, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Maurice Ravel, Valery Larbaud, Saint-John Perse, Edith Wharton, James Huneker, anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski, J\u00f3zef Retinger (later a founder of the European Movement, which led to the European Union, and author of Conrad and His Contemporaries). In the early 1900s Conrad composed a short series of novels in collaboration with Ford Madox Ford."]}, {"page": "James Whale", "response": ["Also in 1933 Whale directed the romantic comedy By Candlelight which gained good reviews and was a modest box office hit.Curtis, p. 219. In 1934 he directed One More River, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by John Galsworthy. The film tells the story of a woman desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal had a difficult time securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.Curtis, pp. 224\u201325."]}, {"page": "Kingston upon Thames", "response": ["John Galsworthy the author was born on Kingston Hill and Jacqueline Wilson grew up, and went to school in Kingston and still lives there today.
