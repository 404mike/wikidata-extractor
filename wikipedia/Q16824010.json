He was the chairman of the Grimsby Haven Company, which oversaw the reopening and expansion of Grimsby's first dock. He was a friend of the artist Sir Thomas Lawrence and the proprietor of Willingham, Lincolnshire, where he constructed his country seat, Willingham House, in 1790. For his investment in the Haven Company, he received the support of Lord Yarborough, one of its main investors and a principal land-owner in Grimsby; owing largely to Lord Yarborough's patronage, Boucherett was returned as the Member of Parliament for that borough at the 1796 election. He was not a frequent voter, but used his position to further the interests of his corporation. Nonetheless, the company met with financial difficulties after it opened the Harbour in 1800. In 1803, Boucherett resigned his seat in favour of Yarborough's heir and pursued a quieter political life. He died in a carriage accident in 1815.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Lawrence", "response": ["File:Thomas Lawrence - Portrait of the Children of Ayscoghe Boucherett - WGA12514.jpg|The Children of Ayscoghe Boucherett"]}, {"page": "Great Grimsby (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Ayscoghe Boucherett"]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["|||Ayscoghe Boucherett||1755||1815 (carriage accident)||||Great Grimsby (1796\u20131803)||High Sheriff of Lincolnshire 1796"]}, {"page": "Jessie Boucherett", "response": ["She was born in November 1825 at North Willingham, near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire.
