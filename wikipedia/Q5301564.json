As Conservator Cleghorn spent a great part of the year in travels surveying forest resources in the vast territory for which he was responsible, with three major tours each of more than six months in 1857, 1858 and 1860. Shorter tours were made to the sal forests of Orissa in the spring of 1859, and a productive week in the Anamalai Hills in September 1859.

However, judging from visible traces of its shoreline which still remained in 1906, it must have been nearly   long, up to   wide and up to  deep. It was apparently formed by the side of a hill slipping down into a valley which slopes northwards, and damming up the stream which ran to the Amaravati River at the bottom of it.
