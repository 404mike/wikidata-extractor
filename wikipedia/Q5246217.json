He made a single senior appearance for the county in 1987 before joining Gloucestershire in 1989. After initially playing mainly in the second XI, Hodgson came close to retiring as a professional before being called in to the first XI due to other players not being available and scoring well. He played in over 100 first-class cricket matches for Gloucestershire in a career which lasted until the end of the 1995 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994", "response": ["The fixture was drawn with only one day, the third, of play possible.
