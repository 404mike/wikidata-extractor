Until his retirement in 2016, Robinson was involved in Northern Irish politics for over 40 years, being a founding member of the DUP along with Ian Paisley.\nRobinson served in the role of General Secretary of the DUP from 1975, a position which he held until 1979 and which afforded him the opportunity to exert unprecedented influence within the fledgeling party. In 1977, Robinson was elected as a councillor for the Castlereagh Borough Council in Dundonald, and in 1979, he became one of the youngest Members of Parliament (MP) when he was narrowly elected for Belfast East. He held this seat until his defeat by Naomi Long in 2010, making him the longest-serving Belfast MP since the 1800 Act of Union.\nIn 1980, Robinson was elected as the deputy leader of the DUP.  Following the re-establishment of devolved government in Northern Ireland as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, Robinson was elected in 1998 as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Belfast East. Robinson subsequently served as Minister for Regional Development and Minister of Finance and Personnel in the Northern Ireland Executive. Robinson was elected unopposed to succeed Ian Paisley as leader of the DUP on 15 April 2008, and was subsequently confirmed as First Minister of Northern Ireland on 5 June 2008.In January 2010, following a scandal involving his wife Iris, Robinson temporarily handed over his duties as First Minister to Arlene Foster under the terms of the Northern Ireland Act 2006. Following a police investigation, which recommended that Robinson should not be prosecuted following allegations made by the BBC in relation to the scandal, he resumed his duties as First Minister.\nThe Official Assembly Commissioner's Investigation and Report completely cleared Robinson of any wrongdoing.  The Report was unanimously accepted by the Standards and Privileges Committee and the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nAgain in September 2015 he stood aside to allow Arlene Foster to become acting First Minister after his bid to adjourn the assembly was rejected. Robinson's action was a response to a murder carried out by the IRA which was linked to a party in the Northern Ireland Executive. Robinson resumed his duties on 20 October 2015. On 19 November 2015, he announced that he would be stepping down as First Minister and as leader of the DUP. Robinson subsequently stepped down as First Minister on 11 January 2016 and has now fully retired from frontline politics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political scandals in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* The Iris Robinson scandal in which First Minister of Northern Ireland Peter Robinson stepped aside for six weeks in January 2010 following revelations of his wife's involvement in an extramarital affair, her attempted suicide, and allegations that he had failed to properly declare details of loans she had procured for her lover to develop a business venture."]}, {"page": "Belfast", "response": ["* Peter Robinson, former First Minister of Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "December 29", "response": ["*1948 \u2013 Peter Robinson, Northern Irish politician, 3rd First Minister of Northern Ireland"]}, {"page": "1948", "response": ["* December 29 \u2013 Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland First Minister"]}, {"page": "Ulster Unionist Party", "response": ["Following a request for a ruling from the DUP's Peter Robinson, the Speaker ruled that the UUPAG was not a political party within the meaning of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000."]}, {"page": "Billy Wright (loyalist)", "response": ["Despite a series of sectarian murders and attacks on Catholic property attributed to the LVF from 1996 to early 1997 (although they were not claimed by the organisation), Wright was not imprisoned until 7 March 1997 when he was convicted of two offences: committing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, and making threats against the life of a woman, Gwen Read.
