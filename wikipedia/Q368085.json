He received the British Academy of Film and Television Arts best cameraman award three times in the 1980s.\nAndrew Dunn was born in London, England. He started making films in his early teens and joined the BBC as a film editor, but continued to develop and shoot his personal projects. Dunn's first film credit was in 1981 for cinematography on the BBC film Andrina.Dunn has served as Director of Photography on a wide variety of films, including L.A. Story, The Madness of King George, Gosford Park, The History Boys, Life as We Know It, Crazy, Stupid, Love, Summer in February, The Butler, Hello Carter, and Endless Love, amongst many others.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Threads (1984 film)", "response": ["On 13 February 2018, Threads was released by Severin Films on Blu-ray in the United States. The programme was scanned in 2K from a broadcast print for this release, including extras such as an audio commentary with Director Mick Jackson and interviews with actress Karen Meagher, Director Of Photography Andrew Dunn, Production Designer Christopher Robilliard and film writer Stephen Thrower.  This is also the first home video release in which the extract from the Alpine Symphony remains intact."]}, {"page": "Gosford Park", "response": ["The film was shot with two cameras, both moving perpetually in opposite directions. The cameras pointed toward no specific area, intended to cause the audience to move their eyes throughout the scene. Altman notes that most of the film's cast had experience in theatre and in film, meaning they had acted in situations where the view of the audience is not on one specific actor, and each audience member sees a slightly different image of the players on stage. Richard E. Grant commented that having two cameras moving at any one time meant that none of the actors knew when the cameras were focused on them. As a result, the actors had to stay \"completely in character, completely in the moment, and interact with everybody in a way that felt as close to real life as you could possibly conjure up.\" Andrew Dunn, the film's cinematographer, appreciated the co-operative nature of Gosford Park's filming process. He shot the film on Kodak Vision Expression 500T film stock generally with two Panavision cameras, using lighting ranging from relatively dim candles to bright hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamps. Editor Tim Squyres described the editing process on Gosford Park as an unusual one, as the dual cameras used were generally located in the same areas when filming, instead of the more standard method of setting up a scene directly.", "Gosford Parks cinematography was a focus of several critics. CNN's Paul Clinton praised Andrew Dunn's camera work, describing it as \"lush and rich; the camera glides up and down the stairs of the grand estate, the period look is beautifully crafted.\" Ed Gonzalez of the online publication Slant Magazine writes that \"Altman's camera is the star of Gosford Park\" and that the film's cinematography is used as an aid to its storytelling. Michael Phillips placed Gosford Park at number nine on his list of Best Films of the Decade. The film was placed at 82 on Slant Magazine's list of best films of the 2000s."]}, {"page": "The Madness of King George", "response": ["* Best Cinematography (Andrew Dunn) \u2013 Nominated", "* Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Technical/Artistic Achievement (Andrew Dunn) \u2013 Won"]}, {"page": "The Crucible (1996 film)", "response": ["|Andrew Dunn"]}, {"page": "Tumbledown", "response": ["**Won: Best Film Cameraman: Andrew Dunn"]}, {"page": "Evening Standard British Film Awards", "response": ["*Best Technical and Artistic Achievement : Andrew Dunn \u2013 The Madness of King George"]}, {"page": "49th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* The Madness of King George \u2013 Andrew Dunn"]}, {"page": "University of Westminster", "response": ["* Entertainers and filmmakers including Raya Abirached (celebrity journalist, and host of the hit TV talent show Arabs Got Talent), Charlie Brooker (BAFTA-nominated broadcaster), Andrew Dunn (BAFTA winning cinematographer Edge of Darkness,  The Bodyguard, Precious and The Butler), Asif Kapadia (Oscar winning filmmaker Senna and Amy), Arthur Max (Oscar nominated and BAFTA winning art director Se7en, Gladiator, Prometheus and The Martian), Seamus McGarvey (cinematographer Atonement, Anna Karenina, The Avengers and The Greatest Showman),  Neal Purvis (scriptwriter James Bond series including Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Spectre) and Stanley Unwin."]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography", "response": ["| The Madness of King George || Andrew Dunn "]}, {"page": "Andrew Dunn", "response": ["Andrew Dunn may refer to:", "* Andrew Dunn (actor) (born 1957), English actor", "* Andrew Dunn (businessman) (1854\u20131934), Australian newspaper proprietor and Member of the Queensland Legislative Council", "* Andrew Dunn (cinematographer), British cinematographer", "* Andrew Dunn (horticulturalist) (born 1917), 2003 Victoria Medal of Honour winner", "* Andrew Dunne (born 1979), Irish rugby union player", "* Andrew Dunne (priest) (died 1823), Irish priest"]}, {"page": "List of accolades received by Gosford Park", "response": ["| Andrew Dunn"]}]}}
