Matthew Bound went close on 20 minutes but his shot from a Nick Cusack free kick went over the Scunthorpe crossbar.  A minute before half-time, Bound put Swansea City ahead: Tony Bird was fouled by Russ Wilcox and Bound headed in the resulting free kick from Michael Howard from around .  Despite applying more pressure in the second half, Scunthorpe failed to score and Bird missed two chances for Swansea, striking one shot high and another against the post, and the match finished 1\u20130 to Swansea.  The second leg took place at Glanford Park in Scunthorpe three days later.  Andy Dawson put the home side ahead after two minutes to level the tie on aggregate.  The goal was followed by a period of Scunthorpe pressure that included misses from both Jamie Forrester and Paul Harsley.  With no further goals in regular time, the match went into extra time and Gareth Sheldon scored two minutes in to make it 2\u20130 to Scunthorpe.  Bird then scored for Swansea City in the 98th minute before Sheldon increased Scunthorpe's lead in the 102nd minute.  John Eyre then fouled Howard and was sent off after a 20-player fight erupted. The game ended 3\u20131 to Scunthorpe who progressed to the final 3\u20132 on aggregate."]}]}}
