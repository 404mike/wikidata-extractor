With Ebenezer Cunningham, he expanded the views of spacetime symmetry of Lorentz and Poincare to a more expansive conformal group of spacetime leaving Maxwell's equations invariant. Moving to the U.S.A., and obtaining a Ph.D. in geometry with Frank Morley, he became a professor of mathematics at California Institute  of Technology. There he taught fluid dynamics to students going into aerodynamics with Theodore von Karman. Bateman made a broad survey of applied differential equations in his Gibbs Lecture in 1943 titled \"The control of an elastic fluid\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luminiferous aether", "response": ["* Harry Bateman (1915) The Structure of the Aether, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 21(6):299\u2013309."]}, {"page": "Stochastic process", "response": ["In 1910 Ernest Rutherford and Hans Geiger published experimental results on counting alpha particles.

The liberties of an electromagnetic field are not confined to kinematic motions, but rather are required only to be locally proportional to a transformation preserving the quadratic form. Harry Bateman's paper in 1910 studied the Jacobian matrix of a transformation that preserves the light cone and showed it had the conformal property (proportional to a form preserver).
