St Pat's took the League to arbitration and won their case (Marney had already been playing for the club for some time).Marney made 29 appearances and scored one goal during that league campaign for the Saints, and though League winners' medals were awarded to both Shelbourne and St Pat's (due to further alleged irregularities), the Saints maintain that they are the sole and rightful League Champions for that season, but they weren't and the following season played in the Intertoto Cup. The League's system for registering players was subsequently changed. He made 16 appearances the following season but after falling out of favour, Marney was plucked from there before the closure of the final 2003 season transfer window when Trevor Anderson signed him for Dundalk.\nPaul scored his first goal for Dundalk against Galway United F.C. in 2004. Marney also had previous spells with West Ham United F.C. and Sutton United F.C..\nMarney won a League of Ireland First Division winners medal after the 2008 season with Dundalk but he departed the Lilywhites after that season and has since has moved back to England.\nHe is rumoured to have taken up Kick-boxing and has had several wins in the sport.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pat Dolan", "response": ["The following season saw the Saints improve dramatically on the pitch and they were leading the league when the FAI announced they were deducting 9 points from St Pats total as they played an ineligible player, Paul Marney, for 3 games. St Pats strongly argued it was a clerical error and as Marney had been registered properly they did not seek to gain an advantage. The FAI overturned this decision and re-instated the nine points, much to the annoyance of closest rivals, Shelbourne's chief executive Oliver Byrne. Dolan and Shelbourne manager Dermot Keely traded insults in their competing tabloid columns on a weekly basis. After receiving an anonymous tip off, the league investigated the registration of every St Pats player and found that one, Charles Livingstone Mbabazi, wasn't correct. They deducted fifteen points and St Pats' title challenge lay in tatters. St Pats, again, angrily denied the charges and a leaked report (to the Evening Herald) commissioned by new league CEO Roy Dooney apparently exposed several minor irregularities in player registrations on several teams but was never released. However, only St Pats were punished and they would settle for third place in the league. St Pats started the season as they ended the previous one and for the first time progressed in Europe beating HNK Rijeka in the Intertoto Cup. Only an away goals defeat to KAA Gent stopped further progress."]}, {"page": "Oliver Byrne", "response": ["The Paul Marney affair saw Byrne and his club in the High Court when the players' \"improper\" registration for St. Patrick's Athletic ended in a court case which left the Inchicore club docked 15 points for further irregularities."]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 League of Ireland Premier Division", "response": [" The season is best remembered for the controversy involving allegations of St Patrick's Athletic fielding ineligible players. St. Pat's originally had 9 points deducted for fielding Paul Marney in the first three games of the season. This was later revoked after arbitration. However Shelbourne appealed against this decision which was taken to the High Court where the appeal was rejected. It was then discovered by the Shelbourne chief executive, Ollie Byrne, that Charles Livingstone Mbabazi had not been registered by St. Pat's for the first five games of the season and so the club had 15 points deducted, three points for each game. The decision of the FAI appeal board to dismiss St. Pat's appeal in the Livingstone case saw Shelbourne confirmed as league champions."]}, {"page": "Marney", "response": ["*Paul Marney (born 1982), English footballer currently unattached"]}, {"page": "List of St Patrick's Athletic F.C. players", "response": ["*Paul Marney"]}, {"page": "List of foreign League of Ireland players", "response": ["* Paul Marney \u2013 St Patrick's Athletic, Dundalk"]}, {"page": "Marney, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Marney"]}]}}
