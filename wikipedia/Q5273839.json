It was their only win in the first 14\u00a0games. Results improved in the second half of the season but it was not until a 1\u20130 win on the final game of the season against Manchester United with a goal from Frank O'Rourke that City prevented an immediate relegation back to Division Two. The following season included a ten-game undefeated spell as Bradford finished seventh, but this was bettered in the 1910\u201311 season, which is Bradford City's most successful campaign. Their league finish of fifth remains the club's highest position, and an FA Cup triumph, with a 1\u20130 win over Newcastle United in the 1911 final is the club's only major honour. The first- and third-round victories were secured with solitary goals from Dicky Bond, but he missed the final four games of the run because of club suspension, the first of which was a 1\u20130 defeat of Burnley in the fourth round in front of 39,146\u00a0fans, a crowd which remains Valley Parade's highest attendance. The biggest win of the run came in the semi-finals with a 3\u20130 victory over Blackburn Rovers. City's supporters were taken to the final in London on 11\u00a0special\u00a0trains, but the game with Newcastle at Crystal Palace ended in a goalless draw and was even described as a \"decidedly dull and uneventful game\". The draw meant a replay was necessary. It took place four days later on 26 April 1911 at Old Trafford, Manchester, when a single goal from Jimmy Speirs in the 15th\u00a0minute gave Bradford a 1\u20130 victory. They were the first winners of a new trophy, appropriately made by Bradford jewellers Fattorini's.", "Bradford's defence of the FA Cup was ended in the fourth round by Barnsley, who went on to succeed Bradford as the holders. The 3\u20132 defeat, played at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, following two draws, brought an end to 11\u00a0consecutive\u00a0clean sheets in the FA Cup\u2014a competition record. The sequence also included a 12th\u00a0clean sheet in the second replay against Barnsley which was abandoned because of crowd trouble. The cup run had included the first Bradford derby between City and cross-city rivals Bradford (Park Avenue). In the league, City finished 11th, the first of four consecutive mid-table finishes before league football was suspended because of the First World War. City's FA Cup hero Speirs, who had joined Leeds City, was one of many footballers to lose his life during the war. Bradford City players who died included Bob Torrance, another FA Cup winner, and Evelyn Lintott, as well as several reserve team players. Frank Buckley and Jock Ewart were seriously wounded, and Dicky Bond was taken prisoner-of-war. In 1921, Bond laid a commemorative wreath on the Cenotaph in memory of his fallen colleagues prior to a league game at Arsenal."]}, {"page": "List of Preston North End F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Dicky Bond"]}, {"page": "Dicky (name)", "response": ["* Dicky Bond (1883\u20131955), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Richard Bond (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dicky Bond"]}, {"page": "Richard Bond", "response": ["* Dicky Bond (1883\u20131955), English footballer"]}]}}
