He made his Forest debut 18 months later, after an injury to regular goalkeeper Jim Barron in a League Cup tie against Chelsea, making several good saves before Chelsea finally scored after 63 minutes. The Daily Express's Steve Curry wrote that \"Hulme tried, often with brilliance, sometimes with luck, to preserve Forest's lead. He made saves from Peter Osgood and Tommy Baldwin of a quality one hardly expects from a reserve.\" He played five times more for the first team before joining Lincoln City of the Fourth Division, initially on loan, in late 1972. He stayed at Lincoln for two seasons, including a loan spell in non-league football with Gainsborough Trinity, and then joined Worksop Town.He later became a cook.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Great Train Robbery (2013 TV series)", "response": ["* Eric Hulme as Jack Mills"]}, {"page": "Hulme, Eric", "response": ["#redirectEric Hulme"]}]}}
