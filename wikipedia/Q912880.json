During that match, Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0158epka was sent off for headbutting Brian O'Neil in his right eye and a mass brawl ensued in the tunnel after the final whistle.  Cresswell was the highest scorer for Preston throughout the season with 16 goals, while West Ham's top marksman was Teddy Sheringham who had 20 followed by Harewood with 17. Preston had played in the second tier of English football since gaining promotion in the 1999\u20132000 season as champions of the Football League Second Division, and had not taken part in the top tier for 44 years.  Conversely, West Ham had played in the Championship for two seasons since being relegated from the Premiership in the 2002\u201303 season.  Winning the play-off final was estimated in the media to be worth up to \u00a335million to the successful team; CNN described the game as \"the world's richest club match\".
