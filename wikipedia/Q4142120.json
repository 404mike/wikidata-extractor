In Japan, totalitarian architecture was presented in the form of the imperial style. According to art historian Yu Suzuki the totalitarian style in Japan was not uniform like in Germany or Italy due to the lack of a close relationship between the government and architects. Architect Nina Konovalova replied that such a relationship was not necessary because of the characteristics of the culture of that time. The unified architectural development was \"unambiguously\" presented through a system of competitions and through government orders."]}, {"page": "Boris Dralyuk", "response": ["* Igor Golomstock - A Ransomed Dissident: A Life in Art Under the Soviets"]}]}}
