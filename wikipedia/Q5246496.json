Initially a bit-part player, Jimmy was the brother of Billy Corkhill. His early appearances usually saw the character in many moneymaking schemes, along with characters such as Barry Grant, Terry Sullivan and Thomas 'Sinbad' Sweeney (Michael Starke). Jimmy Corkhill's first high-profile storyline involved an insurance job on his brother Billy's house, whilst the Corkhills and most of the Close were attending son Rod's graduation from police training. Another famous Brookside storyline occurred in November 1987 and involved Doreen and Billy's crumbling marriage reaching breaking point. When Doreen admitted to Billy she had been sexually propositioned in return to pay off the family's spiralling debts, in an iconic scene, Billy drove around the Close, churning up his neighbour's gardens in a fit of anger, and a distraught Doreen walked out on her desperate family.", "Billy Corkhill's children had remained in the series after his departure.

He was joined by his estranged wife Jackie (Sue Jenkins), who appeared from 1991 working at Dixon's Trading Post, and his elder children Little Jimmy Corkhill (George Christopher) and Lindsey (Claire Sweeney) were initially seen as recurring characters. Jimmy was used to further explore the dark and devastating effects of serious drug addiction, beginning in 1993. The long-running story saw Jimmy descend into uncontrollable drug abuse, climaxing in a cocaine-induced car crash that killed Frank Rogers in November 1993. Teenager Tony Dixon (Mark Lennock) was also involved in the crash and eventually died in February 1994, sparking a feud between Jimmy and Ron that continued until the end of the series. Jimmy had taken part in endless fundraising with Ron's family in an attempt to help Tony recover from what doctors had diagnosed as a persistent vegetative state, but at Tony's funeral he could not hide his guilt any longer and he finally confessed to Ron.", "It was reported in November 2008 that the 13 properties were to be auctioned off collectively, with a guide price of \u00a3550,000\u2013\u00a3600,000.

However, an unnamed Liverpool-based buyer purchased all 13 properties on 17 December 2008 for \u00a3735,000, although by this time the Close was in a state of severe disrepair, and speculation mounted as to what would happen to the disintegrating properties.
