After scoring on the opening day against Crawley Town, Richards then spent a month on the sidelines with an ankle injury. He made his return to the starting eleven against Plymouth Argyle on 10 September, only to end up with a straight red card and three match ban for an incident with Warren Feeney, an incident the striker described as 'handbags'. He returned to the first team on 1 October for only his fourth appearance of the campaign, and bagged both of Vale's goals against Rotherham United. However, after a further six games he was sidelined again due to a recurrence of his ankle injury, and had to wait until December before he returned to action. The injury required surgery to fully heal, however Richards chose to postpone the operation in order to try to help the \"Valiants\" into an unlikely play-off spot. Despite the club entering administration in March, Richards refused the opportunity to jump ship to promotion hopefuls Crawley Town. The administrators also rejected a loan offer from Shrewsbury Town. He finished the season with 17 goals in 36 games, thereby becoming the club's top scorer for the fourth season in a row.
