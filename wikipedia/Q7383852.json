They have contested the last three Super League finals, but the rugby they have produced in recent years is considered amongst the best in Super League. The derby is also sometimes considered a contest in terms of pride between the two counties. Leeds and St Helens have also a historical background, contesting the 1971\u201372 and 1977\u201378 Challenge Cup Finals, each team winning one each. However, the derby is often noted for its bad behaviour\u2014on and off the field. Especially recently, with incidents like the Ryan Bailey \"chicken wing\" tackle on Maurie Fa'asavalu in 2008, the presence of James Graham when the two meet, as well as the numerous fights that have broke out between the two sets of players, the game is certainly regarded as a feisty one, as well as one that produces good-to-watch rugby. Such activities off the field and between games like fights between supporters, has led to some fans being discouraged from attending the fixture at Knowsley Road; shown by somewhat disappointing crowd figures, such as an example of 11,048 in 2010."]}, {"page": "2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|Ryan Bailey||align=\"center\" style=\"background: #eeeeee\"|Int.||align=\"center\"|Craig Fitzgibbon"]}, {"page": "Fuifui Moimoi", "response": ["Moimoi left Leigh once the club was promoted to the Super League to join the newly founded Toronto Wolfpack in Kingstone Press League 1 and rejoined former teammates Liam Kay, Greg Worthington, Jonny Pownall, Bob Beswick, Andrew Dixon, Richard Whiting and Jacob Emmitt as well as coach Paul Rowley.
