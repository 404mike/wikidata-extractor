His mother, Eliza Jane, daughter of Captain Basil Hall, RN, died before he was a year old; his grandmother brought him up in France.  Chamberlain's poor health frequently led him to being sent to the warmer climates of Spain and Italy for the winter.  This constant moving about made it hard for Chamberlain to form lasting friendships.", "In August 1914, he started suffering from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At the end of the war, Chamberlain's paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage. By the time World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain remained British only by virtue of his name and nationality. When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health.Field (1981), p.363 In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: \"No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything humanly possible to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse. ... Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe.\"Field (1981), p. 352 The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an \"Aryan soldier-king\" and as a \"Siegfried\" who had embraced the \"struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry\".R\u00f6hl (2004), p. 207 Chamberlain went on to call the war \"a life-or-death struggle ... between two human ideals: the German and the un-German\". Accordingly, the Reich must \"for the next hundred years or more\" strengthen all things German and carry out \"the determined extermination of the un-German\". Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: \"I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations\u20141870 and 1914\u2014and that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes.\"Field (1981), p. 381 In his 1914 essay, \"Whose Fault Is the War?\", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain.Field (1981), p. 365 Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war, and the French and Russians were just British puppets.Field (1981), pp. 365\u201366  Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war.

Porter purchased the island and allowed a group of Tuscarora Native Americans to live on it and sell their crafts to the tourists who came to the falls by stagecoach and early railroads. In spite of pressure, Porter refused to tame the environment on the island. In 1817, he built a toll bridge to the island for tourists.
