His first season proved to be difficult, with the side comprising an uneasy blend of veterans and youngsters. Winger Jimmy Delaney's sale to Manchester United in February 1946, after asking Celtic for a \u00a32 rise in his weekly wage, and the transfer of Malky MacDonald to Kilmarnock further weakened the side. The season then ended in controversy when Celtic lost to Rangers in the semi-final of the Victory Cup, with numerous dubious decisions made against Celtic by a referee who appeared to be affected by alcohol. Celtic made a poor start to the following season, winning only one of their first five games. A further defeat against Third Lanark in September 1946 saw a large number of fans protest outside the ground, although it was the chairman Tom White who was subject of their criticism and not McGrory."]}]}}
