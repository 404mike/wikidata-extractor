However, the temporary retirement of Cowdell resulted in Sims being nominated to face undefeated Italian Loris Stecca for the vacant European featherweight title. Sims ultimately chose to vacate his British title to take the fight against Stecca. Part of Sims' training regime for the fight involved running the 290 steps of the Newport Transporter Bridge, both up and down, ten times a day. Sims lost the fight to Stecca by TKO and went on to lose three of his next four fights. He moved up to super-featherweight in 1985 and defeated Steve Cleak for the Welsh Area title at his new weight. He also successfully defended the belt against Tony Borg. He unsuccessfully challenged Robert Dickie for the British featherweight title in 1986 and fought in two more bouts before retiring."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Robert Dickie", "|align=left | Robert Dickie"]}, {"page": "Sugar Gibiliru", "response": ["Gibiliru was unbeaten in his next four fights, setting up a challenge for Robert Dickie's British title in April 1991; Gibiliru stopped Dickie in the ninth round to become British champion.\" Former British champion Robert Dickie dies\", BBC, 29 October 2010.
