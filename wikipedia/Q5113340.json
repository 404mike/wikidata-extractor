Most programmes are broadcast live, but usually include at least one filmed report. There will also often be a demonstration of an activity in the studio, or a music or dance performance. Between the 1960s and 2011 the programme was made at BBC Television Centre, and often came from Studio 1, the fourth-largest TV studio in Britain and one of the largest in Europe. This enabled Blue Peter to include large-scale demonstrations and performances within the live programme. From the September 2007 series, the programme was broadcast from a small fixed set in Studio 2. However, from 2009 the series began to use the larger studios once more; also more programmes were broadcast in their entirety from the Blue Peter Garden. The show is also famous for its \"makes\", which are demonstrations of how to construct a useful object or prepare food. These have given rise to the oft-used phrase \"Here's one I made earlier\", as presenters bring out a perfect and completed version of the object they are making\u00a0\u2013 a phrase credited to Christopher Trace, though Marguerite Patten is another possibility. Trace also used the line \"And now for something completely different\", which was later taken up by Monty Python.Alistair McGown, 'Trace, Christopher Leonard (1933\u20131992)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edn, Oxford University Press, October 2005; online edn, October 2008 accessed 29 June 2009 Time is also often given over to reading letters and showing pictures sent in by viewers.", "The first two presenters were Christopher Trace, an actor, and Leila Williams, winner of Miss Great Britain in 1957. The two presenters were responsible for activities which matched the traditional gender roles. As broadcasting historian Asa Briggs expressed it in 1995: \"Leila played with dolls; Chris played with trains\".Asa Briggs The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom: Volume V: Competition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, p.178 They were supported on occasion by Tony Hart,Baxter & Barnes, p.13 an artist who later designed the ship logo,Baxter & Barnes, p.33 who told stories about an elephant called Packi (or Packie). It was broadcast every Thursday for fifteen minutes (17.00\u201317.15) on BBC TV (which later became BBC One). Over the first few months more features were added, including competitions, documentaries, cartoons, and stories. Early programmes were almost entirely studio-based, with very few filmed inserts being made.", "From Monday 10 October 1960, Blue Peter was switched to every Monday and extended from 15 minutes to 20 minutes (17.00\u201317.20). In 1961, Hunter Blair became ill, and was often absent. After he produced his last edition on 12 June 1961,Marson, p.16 a series of temporary producers took up the post. Hunter Blair was replaced the following September by Clive Parkhurst who did not get along with Leila Williams. \"He could not find anything for me to do,\" Williams recalled. In October, she did not appear for six editions, and was eventually fired, leaving Christopher Trace on his own or with one-off presenters.Marson, p.21 Parkhurst was replaced by John Furness, and Anita West joined Trace on 7 May 1962.Marson, p.22 She featured in just 16 editions, making her the shortest-serving presenter, and was replaced by Valerie Singleton,Marson, p.23 who presented regularly until 1972,Marson, p.51 and on special assignments until 1981. Following the departure of Furness, a new producer who was committed to Blue Peter was required, so Biddy Baxter was appointed. At the time she was contracted to schools' programmes on the radio, and therefore unable to take up her new post immediately.Alistair McGown \"Baxter, Biddy (1933\u2013)\", BFI screenonline", "In 1974, the Blue Peter Garden was officially opened in a green space outside the Television Centre restaurant block.Marson, p.84 By this time, Blue Peter had become an established children's programme, with regular features which have since become traditions. In 1978, the show celebrated its twentieth anniversary with a nationwide balloon launch from five regional cities during a special edition of the programme when Christopher Trace, Leila Williams, Valerie Singleton and Peter Purves returned. John Noakes contributed a message pre-recorded on film. At this time, Trace introduced the Blue Peter Outstanding Endeavour Award. Its theme music was updated by Mike Oldfield in 1979, and at the end of the decade a new presenting team was brought in, consisting of Simon Groom, Tina Heath and Christopher Wenner. They were overshadowed by the success of the previous two decades, and failed to make as much of an impact.Marson, p.72 Heath decided to leave after a year when she discovered she was pregnant, but agreed to have a live scan of her baby, something which had never been done on television before. Blue Peter was praised for this by the National Childbirth Trust who told the BBC that in 'five minutes, Blue Peter had done more to educate children about birth than they'd achieved in ten years of sending out leaflets'.Marson, p.83 The production team decided not to renew Wenner's contract, resulting in him leaving along with Heath on 23 June 1980.Marson, p.81", "Sarah Greene and Peter Duncan both joined in 1980, and a new producer, Lewis Bronze, joined in 1982.Marson, p.92 The 1980s saw the Blue Peter studio become more colourful and bright, with the presenters gradually wearing more fashionable outfits, in contrast to the more formal appearance of previous decades.Marson, p.95 Several videos of Blue Peter were made available from 1982, the first being Blue Peter Makes, and an omnibus comprising the two weekly editions appeared in 1986 on Sunday mornings. Ahead of the show's 25th anniversary in October 1983, BBC1 ran a series Blue Peter Goes Silver, revisiting previous summer expeditions. The 25th anniversary itself was commemorated by a documentary presented by Valerie Singleton shown on BBC1 on Sunday, 16 October 1983. This was followed the next day by a special edition of the programme when Christopher Trace presented the annual Outstanding Endeavour Award and Valerie Singleton, Peter Purves, Christopher Wenner, Tina Heath and Sarah Greene returned to celebrate the show's birthday with the current presenting trio of Simon Groom, Peter Duncan and Janet Ellis who launched a national balloon treasure hunt.

Trace was working at a factory at the time and his colleagues made the award to be presented to a viewer who had achieved some remarkable endeavour, such as saving a life or overcoming a particular adversity. Trace had not informed the production team ahead of the live broadcast he was planning on introducing the award on the programme. Initially it was presented annually on the show's October birthday edition, being given to, amongst others, pop group Musical Youth in 1982 and trampoline champion Andrea Holmes in 1983, who received the award from Trace himself on the 25th anniversary show. 11-years-old lifesaver Martin Pout won the award in 1984 followed by Bob Geldof in 1985. Don Allum took the award in 1987 and teenagers Simon Marsh and Anthony Walters were recognised in 1988 for saving a school bus from disaster, being given their award by Valerie Singleton on the show's 30th anniversary edition.

Trace presented for nearly nine years, and Williams for just over three years (although no footage of her has been retained by the BBC). In the early days, as the show ran continuously on a weekly basis, other presenters occasionally stepped in to give the regular team a break. Artist Tony Hart and actress Ann Taylor both presented the show either in place of either Trace or Williams, or sometimes in place of both, with Taylor replacing Williams for six weeks in 1959 and presenting the show at least once alone, as did Hart. When Williams was fired from the show in 1962 following a series of spats with a newly appointed producer, Trace continued to present the show alone or with one-off presenters until a replacement was found. The role went to Anita West, who presented sixteen editions over a four-month period in 1962\u2014the shortest tenure of any full-time presenter\u2014before abruptly resigning due to her imminent divorce, something she had not revealed to the producers. Her tenure was so short that no footage from her time on Blue Peter exists in the BBC Archives, although footage of her audition remains, along with that of Valerie Singleton and other auditionees. It was not until 1998 that West was officially recognised as a former presenter. "]}]}}
