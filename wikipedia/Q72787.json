She became well known after 1942 when she discovered with A. J. Clark and J. M. Robson that mustard gas could cause mutations in fruit flies. She wrote 91 scientific papers, and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the Royal Society of London.\nIn 1976, she was awarded the Royal Society's Darwin Medal. Aside her scientific contributions and love of science, she was remarkable in many other ways, including her wide interests, independence, modesty, and transparent honesty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mutagenesis", "response": ["Mutagenesis  is a process by which the genetic information of an organism is changed by the production of a mutation.  It may occur spontaneously in nature, or as a result of exposure to mutagens. It can also be achieved experimentally using laboratory procedures. A mutagen is a mutation-causing agent, be it chemical or physical, which results in an increased rate of mutations in an organism's genetic code. In nature mutagenesis can lead to cancer and various heritable diseases, but it is also a driving force of evolution. Mutagenesis as a science was developed based on work done by Hermann Muller, Charlotte Auerbach and J. M. Robson in the first half of the 20th century.", "DNA may be modified, either naturally or artificially, by a number of physical, chemical and biological agents, resulting in mutations. Hermann Muller found that \"high temperatures\" have the ability to mutate genes in the early 1920s, and in 1927, demonstrated a causal link to mutation upon experimenting with an x-ray machine, noting phylogenetic changes when irradiating fruit flies with  relatively high dose of X-rays. Muller observed a number of chromosome rearrangements in his experiments, and suggested mutation as a cause of cancer.  The association of exposure to radiation and cancer had been observed as early as 1902, six years after the discovery of X-ray by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, and the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel.   Lewis Stadler, Muller's contemporary, also showed the effect of X-rays on mutations in barley in 1928, and of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on maize in 1936. In 1940s, Charlotte Auerbach and J. M. Robson found that mustard gas can also cause mutations in fruit flies."]}, {"page": "May 14", "response": ["*1899 \u2013 Charlotte Auerbach, German-Scottish folklorist, geneticist, and zoologist (d. 1994)"]}, {"page": "March 17", "response": ["*1994  \u2013 Charlotte Auerbach, German-Jewish Scottish folklorist, geneticist, and zoologist (b. 1899)"]}, {"page": "Mutagen", "response": ["Chemical mutagens were not demonstrated to cause mutation until the 1940s, when Charlotte Auerbach and J.

A large number of chemical mutagens have since been identified, especially after the development of the Ames test in the 1970s by Bruce Ames that screens for mutagens and allows for preliminary identification of carcinogens. Early studies by Ames showed around 90% of known carcinogens can be identified in Ames test as mutagenic (later studies however gave lower figures), and ~80% of the mutagens identified through Ames test may also be carcinogens. Mutagens are not necessarily carcinogens, and vice versa. Sodium azide for example may be mutagenic (and highly toxic), but it has not been shown to be carcinogenic."]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Charlotte Auerbach (1899\u20131994), German and British geneticist, founded the discipline of mutagenesis after discovering the effect of mustard gas on fruit flies"]}, {"page": "Krefeld", "response": ["*Charlotte Auerbach (1899\u20131994), genetic scientist"]}, {"page": "1899 in science", "response": ["* May 14 \u2013 Charlotte Auerbach (died 1994), German-Jewish Scottish geneticist and zoologist."]}, {"page": "List of geneticists", "response": ["*Charlotte Auerbach (1899\u20131994), German-born British pioneer in  mutagenesis"]}, {"page": "Henrik Kacser", "response": ["He was elected to the Fellowship of The Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1990.
