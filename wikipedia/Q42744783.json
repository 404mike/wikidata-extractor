Frustrated by the lack of progress on voting rights, in 1907, she became an active member of the more radical WSPU. On 18 November 1910, Anderson joined her mother, Emmeline Pankhurst, Alfred Caldecott, Hertha Ayrton, Mrs Elmy, Hilda Brackenbury, Princess Sophia Duleep Singh, and 300 women to petition Prime Minister Asquith for voting rights. The protest became known as Black Friday, due to the violence and sexual assault the protesters faced from the police and male bystanders. More than one hundred women were arrested, including Anderson, but all were released without charge. In 1912, she was imprisoned in Holloway, briefly, for her suffragette activities which included breaking a window by throwing a brick. In 1914, Anderson joined Agnes Harben and the new group of women and men: H. J. Gillespie, Gerald Gould, Bessie Lansbury and George Lansbury, Mary Neal, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Julia Scurr and John Scurr, Evelyn Sharp, and Edith Ayrton, Louise Eates and Lena Ashwell  in starting the United Suffragists which grew to have branches in London, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Matilda Chaplin Ayrton", "response": ["Chaplin and Ayrton's daughter was the feminist and author Edith Ayrton, wife of Israel Zangwill and mother of Oliver Zangwill."]}, {"page": "United Suffragists", "response": ["Founder members of the United Suffragists included Louisa Garrett Anderson, H.

In 1912 she helped her in-laws Laura and Leonard Franklin form the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage which was open to both male and female members.

Other members included Edith Ayrton, Hugh Franklin, her sister Lily Montagu and Inez Bensusan. The organisation was generally moderate but it had radical members.

On 3 November 1912 Laura and Leonard Franklin formed the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage. It is thought that it was the only Jewish suffrage group in the world. It was open to members irrespective of their gender. The group's aim was to improve both political and religious rights for women. It was felt that some Jewish people may be more inclined to join this group in preference to an unspecific women's suffrage group.

Henrietta Franklin was one of the few Jewish women to raise their profile in the suffrage movement. Her sister Lily Montagu led a liberal Jewish movement in Britain and in 1902 they had arranged the first meeting of the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism at Henrietta Franklin's house.
