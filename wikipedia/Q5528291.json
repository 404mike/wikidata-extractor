The photograph was taken by Frank Ockenfels in New York, then was sent to computer designer Dave De Angelis in England, who created the final cover. The idea for the coat originated from Gavin Turk's 1995 exhibit Indoor Flag. Bowie co-designed the coat with Alexander McQueen, which he wore for the summer festivals, the Earthling cover and later the VH1 Fashion Awards in 1997. He explained: \"[It's] the ultimate anti-icon. A retelling of the British flag joke, again torn and stained... the tatty remains of a metaphysical empire.\" Pegg compares Bowie's Colossus of Rhodes-like stance in the cover to a \"proud eighteenth-century landowner in a Gainsborough portrait\" and, simultaneously, an alien-like visitor in an effect similar to the sleeve for Ziggy Stardust (1972).
