During the war, Bainbridge played for Hartlepools United. His exploits there led to him signing for Manchester United when peace was declared, but, although he scored in a friendly match on his debut, he only made one appearance for the club and signed for Bury in May 1946, losing his place in the United team to Johnny Carey. He spent just over two seasons with Bury and moved to Tranmere Rovers in November 1948 after just two appearances for the Shakers.\nIt was at Tranmere that Bainbridge made the biggest impact. In six seasons with the Wirral side, Bainbridge played in almost 170 league matches, scoring 63 goals in the process. He died in Chester in 1966 at the age of 44.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1922", "response": ["** Bill Bainbridge, English footballer (d. 1966)"]}, {"page": "William Bainbridge (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Bill Bainbridge (1922\u20131966), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On 6 March, Tranmere Rovers striker Bill Bainbridge put his side ahead at Prenton Park, but the Vale equalised within two minutes and went on to win the game 3\u20131.

The trip to face Carlisle United at Brunton Park five days later saw six players sit out with injuries, leaving Hancock, Tomkinson, Len Barber, Elsby, Hulligan and Alan Bennett all to make rare appearances; Ken Fish also took charge of the team as Freddie Steele was watching FA Cup opponents West Bromwich Albion. The game finished goalless, with both Hancock and \"Cumbrians\" goalkeeper Jimmy McLaren receiving praise for several excellent saves. Vale ended the month with a 1\u20130 victory over Accrington Stanley despite Barber missing the second and last penalty the club would be awarded in the season."]}, {"page": "1945\u201346 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bill Bainbridge"]}, {"page": "Bainbridge (name)", "response": ["*Bill Bainbridge (born 1922), English footballer"]}]}}
