This followed a season in which he won only three matches, owing to the severity of his medical condition. He reached the quarter-finals of the LG Cup in the following season.", "The 2003/2004 season ended with him having to pull out of a World Championship match against Alan McManus while trailing 1\u20137, as the regular steroid injections he required in his neck caused problems with his vision. The 2004\u201305 season was disastrous for him, as he lost all his ranking tournament matches, and in September 2005 he announced his retirement from the game. Small then started coaching other players, but by 2009 his condition had worsened, and he had to give up coaching."]}, {"page": "Nigel Bond", "response": ["After a strong amateur career, Bond turned professional for the 1989\u20131990 season. He reached his first ranking semi-final in his first season, and his first final in his second season, but his career peaked in the mid-1990s. In the 1994 World Championships, Bond pulled off one of the biggest comebacks in the event's history, rallying from 9\u20132 to defeat Cliff Thorburn 10\u20139 in what would be Thorburn's final appearance at the Crucible. A year later, Bond reached the final after beating Stephen Lee, Alan McManus, Gary Wilkinson and Andy Hicks, but lost to Stephen Hendry 18\u20139. This was his only semi-final run of the season. As a consequence of reaching the final, he climbed to number 5 in the world rankings for 1996/97, and in that same season he acquired his only ranking tournament victory (after three previous losing finals), the British Open, beating John Higgins 9\u20138 after needing a snooker in the final frame, winning the World Snooker Association Performance of the Year award for this achievement, although he has failed to maintain this level of performance.", "Bond once again qualified for the Australian Goldfields Open in the 2012\u201313 season, but lost to Neil Robertson 1\u20135 in the last 32. In December, he reached the World Open in Haikou, China, with wins over Jimmy White and Jamie Burnett. At the venue he saw off Zhu Yinghui 5\u20133 in the wildcard round and received a bye through to the last 16 due to the withdrawal of Ali Carter. There he lost 1\u20135 to Judd Trump. Bond was also crowned World Seniors champion during the season without dropping a frame in a total of seven matches, concluding with a 2\u20130 victory against Tony Chappel in the final. Bond's season ended when he was beaten 8\u201310 by Alan McManus in the third round of World Championship Qualifying.
