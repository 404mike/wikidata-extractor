She was the daughter of the writer and music critic Stanley Makower. Graduating from Newnham College, Cambridge (M.A. Oxon, inc. awarded 1938, and with a Ph.D. in Economics (London School of Economics and Political Science) 1937, she joined Jacob Marschak's Oxford Institute of Statistics before serving in Frederick Lindemann's S-Branch, Sir Winston Churchill's private economics and statistics service, during World War II. After the war, she served briefly with the British Control Commission in Germany and later with the United Nations, before returning to academia and the London School of Economics, where she retired as a Reader in 1977. Makower was at the forefront of the statistical turn in the British economics of the 1930s, and remained an influential figure after the war, acting as an important link between the mathematical economics developed at the Cowles Commission and British economics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "G.

Its role was to report directly to prime minister Winston Churchill distilling complex data into succinct charts and figures, to aid speedy evaluation. Members of the S-Branch included Sir Roy Harrod, G. L. S. Shackle, Helen Makower and later, D. G. Champernowne and David Bensusan-Butt. The operation of this statistical branch often caused tensions between government departments, but it was important because it allowed Churchill to make quick decisions based on accurate data.Booth, Alan (1986).

This included her early investigations of the travelling salesman problem, beginning with a 1955 paper with Morton, and continuing with a 1979 research report on 100 city traveling salesman problems. In addition, Land advanced OR methodology through publication of notable work on shortest path algorithms, quadratic programming, bicriteria decision problems, and statistical data fitting. Following her retirement from the LSE in 1987, she continued several research projects, resulting in contributions to data envelopment analysis, the quadratic assignment problem, and combinatorial auctions."]}]}}
