Among the crowd on the pitch was Hammam, who waved a Welsh flag in celebration. Some of these fans quickly approached the section of the ground holding away supporters and missiles were thrown between the two sets of supporters as police intervened. As the situation escalated, the police line launched a baton charge to force the pitch invaders back and police dogs were also brought onto the pitch. Leeds' Lee Bowyer was targeted by a Cardiff fan as he left the field, narrowly avoiding a punch thrown by the supporter, while teammates Batty and Viduka also required assistance from security personnel to leave the pitch. One of the supporters seen to be causing trouble was later identified as Dai Thomas, a former Cardiff player who had previous convictions related to football hooliganism. He was charged with one count of threatening and violent behaviour after being filmed throwing an advertising hoarding at Leeds supporters and was jailed for 60 days as well as being banned from all football grounds in England and Wales for six years. There were minor disturbances outside the ground as Leeds fans returned to their coaches but these were quickly dispersed by police. Four fans were arrested on the night while a further eight were arrested in the following weeks after being identified from police footage. Leeds defender Rio Ferdinand was later quoted as describing Ninian Park as \"the scariest ground he'd ever played in\"."]}]}}
