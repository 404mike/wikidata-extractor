He was known for songs including 'To Be There', 'The Same Old Game', and, perhaps most famously of all, 'On the Back of Daddy-O'. In this last song, he would perform dressed in a creatively devised life-size dummy with a wicker work frame, on whose back he appeared to be sitting.  A popular entertainer, Torr appeared at all the major music hall venues around Britain including Wilton's Music Hall in London", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Merrick", "response": ["Merrick was born in Leicester and began to develop abnormally before the age of five. His mother died when he was eleven and his father soon remarried. Rejected by his father and stepmother, he left home and went to live with his uncle Charles Merrick. In 1879, 17-year-old Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse. In 1884, he contacted a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named 'the Elephant Man'. After touring the East Midlands, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop rented by showman Tom Norman. Norman's shop was visited by surgeon Frederick Treves who invited Merrick to be examined. After Merrick was displayed by Treves at a meeting of the Pathological Society of London in 1883, Norman's shop was closed by the police and Merrick joined Sam Roper's circus and was toured in Europe.", "Merrick concluded that his only escape from the workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions. He knew of a Leicester music hall comedian and proprietor named Sam Torr. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided he could make money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, he would have to be a travelling exhibit. To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career."]}, {"page": "Music hall", "response": ["* Sam Torr (1849\u20131923)"]}, {"page": "List of British music hall performers", "response": ["* Sam Torr (1849\u20131923)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Nottingham", "response": ["*(1849\u20131923) Sam Torr, music-hall performer"]}, {"page": "Music hall songs", "response": ["*\"To Be There\" (1886) (written by C.A.
