He was known for songs including 'To Be There', 'The Same Old Game', and, perhaps most famously of all, 'On the Back of Daddy-O'. In this last song, he would perform dressed in a creatively devised life-size dummy with a wicker work frame, on whose back he appeared to be sitting.  A popular entertainer, Torr appeared at all the major music hall venues around Britain including Wilton's Music Hall in London", "link_mentions": {}}}
