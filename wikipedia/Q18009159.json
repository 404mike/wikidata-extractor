First trained as a teacher in a normal school, she took to poetry early in life and after a brief teaching period worked as a travel writer for Canadian newspapers and a columnist for the Toronto Globe. Afterward she wrote for the Washington Post where she was put in charge of the current literature section. Later she made a journey to India and married an Anglo-Indian civil servant thereafter dividing her time between England and India. She wrote 22 works of fiction, many with international themes and settings. Her novels met with mixed acclaim and are rarely read today. In 2016, she was named a National Historic Person on the advice of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.Sara Jeannette Duncan (1861-1922), Parks Canada backgrounder, Feb. 15, 2016", "Duncan had been treated for tuberculosis in 1900, spending the summer out of doors in the fresh air of Simla, as chronicled in On the Other Side of the Latch (1901), published in the United States and Canada as The Crow's Nest. Childless, she died of chronic lung disease on 22 July 1922 at Ashtead, Surrey, whence she and her husband had moved in 1921. She had been a smoker and it is possible that the cause of death was emphysema, although her lung problems generally may have been exacerbated by the climate and sanitation in Calcutta. She was buried at St Giles's Church, Ashtead, and left a CAD$13,000 estate. Though she rarely returned to Canada after marrying Cotes, and last visited in 1919, she had always insisted that the royalties from her books were paid into her bank account in Brantford. Everard Cotes, who was her beneficiary and worked as parliamentary correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor, outlived her and remarried in 1923, fathering two children before his death in 1944.", "* as Mrs Everard Cotes (Sara Jeanette Duncan)", "* as Sara Jeanette Duncan (Mrs Everard Cotes)", "* as Mrs Everard Cotes (Sara Jeanette Duncan)", "* as Sara Jeanette Duncan (Mrs Everard Cotes)", "* as Sara Jeanette Duncan (Mrs Everard Cotes)", "* as Sarah Jeanette Duncan (Mrs Everard Cotes)", "* as Mrs Everard Cotes (Sara Jeanette Duncan)", "* as Sara Jeanette Duncan\u00a0\u2014 Mrs Everard Cotes.
