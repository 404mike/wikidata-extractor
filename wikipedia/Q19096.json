The address was the home of a member, A. Jourjon, and became the club's address when it was registered as a new organisation at the pr\u00e9fecture on 11 March 1882. Evidence that de Vivie was a reasonably prosperous man is shown in a club rule that allowed membership only to amateurs, a definition which excluded ordinary working men.The argument, which nearly kept two English cyclists, Frederick Keeping and Edward Battell, out of the first of the modern Olympic Games was that only a gentleman had enough money not to need prizes. Therefore only a gentleman could be an amateur. Further evidence is the writer Jean-Pierre Baud's calculation that a bicycle cost 200 francs or 56 times the daily wage of an everyday worker."]}, {"page": "Adolf Schmal", "response": ["After a day off, Schmal was back in the saddle and winning two bronze medals, in the time trial Schmal finished on a time of 26 seconds which matched the time of Stamatios Nikolopoulos in second place behind the Frenchman Paul Masson, but Nikolopoulos won the race-off and Schmal finished in third place, he also finished in third place in the 10 km race behind the French duo of L\u00e9on Flameng and winner Paul Masson.
