The Wisden editorial drew attention to an additional feat by Middlesex in defeating \"The Rest\" by nine wickets in the last match of the season at The Oval. Previously, only Yorkshire (1905 and 1935) had beaten The Rest, the fixture having lapsed from 1936 to 1946. Yorkshire had won the County Championship in 1946 but slipped to seventh place in 1947 and Wisden remarked on the retirement of \"several veterans\" after the 1946 season, although the highest innings score of the 1947 season, 270 not out, was achieved by Yorkshire's Len Hutton.Wisden 1948, p. 83."]}, {"page": "East of England cricket team", "response": ["* Laurie Gray (1948)"]}, {"page": "Charles Morgan (Nottinghamshire cricketer)", "response": ["Morgan made a single first-class appearance for Nottinghamshire against Middlesex in the 1946 County Championship at Trent Bridge.
