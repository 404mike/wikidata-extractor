He was the son of Percy Alfred Heming, a well-known baritone, and Joyce Savage. Educated at Wellington College in Berkshire, Heming went on to study conducting at the Royal Academy of Music, and was slated to become a student-assistant of John Barbirolli.In 1942, while serving as a lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps, Heming was killed in action at the battle of El Alamein.  Upon the return home of his personal effects, his mother discovered musical sketches Heming had written during and after his voyage to Africa.  Percy Heming showed the sketches to Barbirolli, who engaged the composer and conductor Anthony Vincent Collins to edit the sketches into a work called Threnody for a Soldier Killed in Action.  \nThe work was premiered at Sheffield City Hall, by the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra conducted by Barbirolli, on 14 January 1944, which would have been Heming's 24th birthday.  In 1945 Barbirolli recorded the piece on HMV with the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra. Royalton Kisch, a schoolfriend at Wellington College who had also served in the same regiment as Heming, performed the piece many times in Italy and Athens in 1944\u201345, the first time being the performance on 12 December 1944 at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. The piece received many further performances over the next few years, although it has been largely forgotten since.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anthony Collins (composer)", "response": ["Four one-act operas -  Perseus and Andromeda, Catherine Parr, The Blue Harlequin and Kanawa - were composed in the early 1930s for the Royal College of Music.

While at Wellington, he and his friend, Michael Heming, were very active musically, with Royalton-Kisch playing the clarinet, conducting the school orchestra and forming a madrigal group. At Cambridge University he was a student of E.J. Dent and elected President of the University Music Society.  He was only the second undergraduate ever to conduct the Society's Orchestra, giving performances of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas at the Arts Theatre, Cambridge, in March 1940.See Patmore, 2012, p. 28 and Sanders, 2012, p. 9.
