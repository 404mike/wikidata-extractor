He was a talented and prominent member of the Norwich School of painters.\nAfter attending the Norwich Grammar School, his parents paid for him to be trained as an artist by Robert Ladbrooke, one of the founding members of the Norwich Society of Artists. During his career he exhibited in both Norwich and London, with some success. In 1816 he joined a rival society in Norwich, which lasted a few years. He was influenced by the work of the Dutch masters, whose works he studied and copied following a visit to Holland in 1821. His own most important painting, Thorpe Water Frolic, Afternoon, was first exhibited in Norwich in 1825. \nIn 1826 he married the artist Emily Coppin.

He became a patron of the arts, and an influential friend of the artist John Linnell. In 1840, after resigning his curacy and leaving England for the Middle East, he travelled to Egypt, Palestine and Syria, and joined the explorer Sir Charles Fellows's archaeological expedition in Lycia (now in Turkey) as an illustrator.

His friendships with Ninham and Joseph Stannard may have begun at school.", "Daniell's first attempts at etching were made with Joseph Stannard in February 1824. The style of his earliest works were influenced by Stannard, but he later became more affected by the works of J. M. W. Turner. Three distinct groups of etchings can be identified: those produced in Norfolk, including Flordon Bridge, his masterpiece from his early years; a more grandiose group of etchings made during his tours of Scotland and the continent; and those made during his curacy at Banham, which includes his most assured work of this period, Whitlingham Lane near Trowse. He stopped etching after his move to London. Although his Norfolk prints are mostly landscapes, they were intended to be artistic rather than topographically accurate, and any figures were used simply to indicate the scale of the landscape they were set in."]}, {"page": "James Sillett", "response": ["The Norwich School of painters, which included Sillett, was a group connected by geographical location, the depiction of Norwich and rural Norfolk, and by close personal and professional relationships.

She painted until she was in her eighties, mainly depicting paintings of flowers in vases, fruit or game animals. She exhibited in both Norwich and London, and was awarded a large gold medal in 1820 for an original painting of flowers, and two further gold medals in later years. She became  an honorary member of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1831.

The Norwich School artists were connected by geographical location, their depiction of Norwich and rural Norfolk, and by close personal and professional relationships. By the end of the 19th century their paintings, which had once been regarded as modern and progressive, were seen as belonging to a bygone age, a view that Andrew Hemingway has attributed to the \"mythology of rural Englishness\" that prevailed at the start of the 20th century.", "Coppin met and got to know her fellow artist Joseph Stannard in 1820 when attending meetings of the Norwich Society of Artists, On 3 January 1826, with Emily already an established artist who had exhibited works, they were married at St George's, Tombland in Norwich. They were a well-matched couple, with both coming from artistic backgrounds. Their daughter Emily was born in 1827. Their second child Harriet Augusta died in March 1830, aged nine months. The marriage was short-lived, for Joseph Stannard died of tuberculosis in 1830 at the age of thirty-three, despite the efforts of his wife, who tried many doctors and treatments in an attempt to save him. She was to outlive him by over half a century.", "On least one occasion Stannard signed a painting 'Emily Stannard', but her works are more usually signed 'Mrs. Joseph Stannard'. Her canvasses, which were often left unvarnished, were consistently painted with a thin, diluted paint, in a similar way to the works of the Dutch masters she studied."]}]}}
