All the pieces were in place for new \"large-scale English grammars\" which combined the disparate approaches of the previous decades.  The first work to lay claim to the new scholarship was British linguist Henry Sweet's A new English grammar: logical and historical, published in two parts, Phonology and Accidence (1892) and Syntax (1896), its title suggesting not only continuity and contrast with Maetzner's earlier work, but also kinship with the contemporary A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (begun 1884), later the Oxford English Dictionary (1895).  Two other contemporary English grammars were also influential.  English Grammar: Past and Present, by John Collinson Nesfield, was originally written for the market in colonial India.  It was later expanded to appeal to students in Britain as well, from young men preparing for various professional examinations to students in \"Ladies' Colleges.\" Other books by Nesfield include A Junior Course In English Composition, A Senior Course In English Composition, but it was his A Manual Of English Grammar and Composition that proved really successful both in Britain and her colonies\u2014so much so that it formed the basis for many other grammar and composition primers including but not limited to Warriner's English Grammar and Composition, and High School English Grammar and Composition, casually called Wren & Martin, by P.
