He scored more than 15,000 first-class runs.\nRevill was born in Sheffield, the son of Thomas who played first-class cricket for Derbyshire between 1913 and 1920. Revill's career began at Derbyshire where he appeared in the non first-class programme in 1945. He made his first-class debut for Derbyshire in the 1946 season at Ilford against Essex in May, scoring 31 and 48.  He finished the year with 616 runs and played regularly for the county till the end of the 1957 season. with a career-best 156 not out against Leicestershire in 1949.\nRevill, a fine close fielder, lost form in the 1956 season and after failing again to reach 1000 runs in the 1957 season, he transferred to the weak Leicestershire eleven where after two fair returns he dropped out of the team during 1960, playing last against Middlesex at Lords where he scored 0.\nRevill was a right-handed batsman and played 654 innings in 387 first-class matches with an average of 26.48 and a top score of 156 not out. He hit sixteen centuries and passed 1000 runs in a season nine times (including twice for Leicestershire) with a best of 1643 runs (35.71) in 1950. He was an occasional right-arm off-break bowler and took 49 first-class wickets with an average of 39.26 and a best performance of 3 for 12. He played one one-day match without scoring, but taking a wicket.Revill played in Leicestershire Second Eleven in 1960 and 1962. From 1963 until 1965, and again in 1968, he played for Berkshire, making an appearance in the 1965 Gillette Cup against Somerset. His picture is up in the Gateway Centre, Derby.\nRevill died at the age of 75 in Brent, London. In his obituary in The Daily Telegraph, it was noted that he was a fine raconteur. Michael Parkinson  said \"he could talk the leg off an iron pot\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hit wicket", "response": ["Playing for Surrey against Derbyshire at the Oval in 1953, Alan Revill's hand was hit by a lifting delivery from Alec Bedser.  Revill shook his hand in pain, and his glove flew off, hit the stumps, and dislodged a bail.  The umpire considered that Revill was still \"playing at the ball\", and he was dismissed \"hit wicket\"."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Derbyshire was the most improved team of the year, rising ten places from fifteenth in 1946 to fifth in 1947. They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.Playfair, pp. 91\u201392."]}, {"page": "List of Derbyshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["| 1950|| 30|| 8 || 9 || 13 || 5 ||Pat Vaulkhard || Alan Revill || Albert Rhodes || George Dawkes"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1946", "response": ["The club retained a nucleus of pre-war players, and Pat Vaulkhard, a future captain, had previously played for Nottinghamshire.

His highest career score, an innings of 143, was made against the then County Champions, Surrey, at The Oval in 1955 when he was 39. But new recruits in Willie Watson and Alan Revill in 1958 meant more competition for batting places, and after playing half the season he retired to take charge of the second eleven, where he continue to play as captain until 1966.
