He scored 31 goals in over 150 league and cup appearances for Wolves.\nIn 1977, he returned to Burnley before moving to Huddersfield Town where he was part of a minor piece of football history, being one of three goalkeepers used in an FA Cup Tie v Shrewsbury Town in 1981. Regular goalkeeper Andy Rankin was injured and Kindon took his place, only to be injured himself, his place in turn being taken by Mark Lillis. Each of them conceded a goal, and this remains an English record for the number of keepers used in one game. Injury then ended his career in 1982. Kindon was an England Youth, Under-23 and \"B\" international. He is now an after-dinner speaker.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mick Buxton", "response": ["Buxton initially joined Huddersfield Town in late 1977 from Southend United as the Physiotherapist under manager Tom Johnston. After Johnston's resignation in 1978 Buxton was appointed caretaker manager of Huddersfield Town. He quickly got the job permanently and set about revitalising the Fourth Division club. He installed John Haselden, who was already at the club, as his Assistant Manager and he would also take on the Physio duties. Buxton's first season was the 1978\u201379 season where Huddersfield finished 9th in the Fourth Division. It was the season after which would prove to be the catalyst for the most successful period of Town's history in the past 10 years. He offloaded the deadwood and brought in players such as Brian Stanton, Mick Laverick and Steve Kindon. He would eventually go on to be one of the most successful managers in the club's recent history, winning promotion to the Third Division at the end of the 1979\u201380 season where the team scored 101 goals in the league. This team is still loved by the club to this day and have held reunions in 2000, 2010, 2016 and 2017 where the majority of the team and coaching staff still attend. Buxton then took Huddersfield up to the Second Division in 1983. The Terriers would remain in the second tier for five seasons, but Buxton was sacked on 23 December 1986, to be replaced by Steve Smith. Mick Buxton later returned to Town in March 1993 as coach under Ian Ross, and helped the Terriers on one of their best runs in recent history where they only lost once in last eighteen games to avoid relegation. Buxton resigned at the end of the season and Ian Ross soon followed suit."]}, {"page": "List of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|July 1972|| Steve Kindon||Burnley||\u00a3100,000"]}, {"page": "Steve Kindon (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steve Kindon"]}, {"page": "Pat Partridge", "response": ["On 12 September 1978, he refereed an infamous meeting between Burnley and Celtic in the quarter final of the now-defunct Anglo-Scottish Cup, in which Steve Kindon gave Burnley the lead after 55 minutes.
