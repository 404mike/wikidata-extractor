He scored 232 runs in the series with one half-century (51*) at 33.14; and took only seven wickets which were enormously expensive. Pakistan won by an innings at Headingley with the other four Tests drawn, although England were in superior positions in the First and Fourth tests which lost much time to rain, and only narrowly failed to level the series in the Fourth, running out of overs chasing a small target. When Pakistan totalled 708 at The Oval, the 217 runs conceded by Botham, from 52 overs, were the most by an England bowler, passing the 204 by Ian Peebles, from 71 overs, against Australia at The Oval in 1930, although he took three wickets and also ran out Imran Khan. The half-century, his final and by far his slowest Test fifty, was a dogged, defensive effort occupying most of the last day in a drawn match, in an unbroken partnership with Gatting (150*) to save the 5th test and keep England's margin of defeat at 1\u20130. He declined to go on tour with England the following winter, either for the 1987 World Cup in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (in which England reached the final) or for the subsequent tours of Pakistan (lost 1\u20130) and New Zealand (a rain-ruined 0\u20130 drawn series)."]}, {"page": "Bodyline", "response": ["The Australian cricket team toured England in 1930.

The English cricket authorities felt that specific tactics would be required to curtail Bradman from being even more successful on his own Australian pitches;Frith, pp. 39\u201341. some believed that Bradman was at his most vulnerable against leg-spin bowling as Walter Robins and Ian Peebles had supposedly caused him problems; consequently two leg-spinners were included in the English touring party of 1932\u201333.Douglas, p. 121."]}, {"page": "1930 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Donald Bradman, Clarrie Grimmett, Beverley Lyon, Ian Peebles, Maurice Turnbull"]}, {"page": "Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)", "response": ["As well as his skill, O'Reilly was also known for his competitiveness, and bowled with the aggression of a paceman. In a short biographical essay on O'Reilly for the Barclays World of Cricket book, his contemporary, the England cricketer Ian Peebles, wrote that \"any scoring-stroke was greeted by a testy demand for the immediate return of the ball rather than a congratulatory word.

In June, he was appointed as captain for the Test against New Zealand (two more Tests were later added). The English selectors were searching for possible captains for the 1932\u201333 tour of Australia, with Bradman and Australia's strong batting line up foremost in their minds. Christopher Douglas believes that, as Jardine was not a regular county captain, the selectors wanted to assess his leadership ability but had probably not settled on him as a final choice. He was also chosen as a dependable, proven batsman.Douglas, pp. 93\u201395. While Percy Fender approved of his appointment, The Times' correspondent believed that he was unproven and others were more deserving of the leadership.Douglas, pp. 94\u201395. Ian Peebles, writing 40 years later, claimed that Jardine's appointment was popular but cricket administrators had misgivings.Peebles, p. 83. Alan Gibson believed that Jardine was chosen because the other candidates were either not worth their place in the side, too old or had controversy attached to them.Gibson, pp. 148\u201356. Furthermore, Jardine impressed the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, who stated that he was very effective in selection meetings through his knowledge of cricket history and went into great detail to choose the correct players;Warner, p. 136. it seems that Warner was the driving force behind Jardine's appointment.Le Quesne, p. 122.", "In his first Test as captain, Jardine clashed with several players. Frank Woolley was unhappy with his captain's manner, feeling humiliated at his treatment in the field at one point. He also rebuked Ian Peebles and Walter Robins, two young amateur bowlers, for their amusement over an incident in the match.Peebles, pp. 86\u201387. The home team's fortunes were mixed, as New Zealand put up a very good fight in their first Test in England, and both sides could have won. The New Zealanders were so successful that a further two Tests were arranged. Jardine was criticised in the press for not instructing his batsmen to score quickly enough to win in the fourth innings, although this strategy was unlikely to succeed, and the match was drawn.Douglas, p. 99. England won the second Test by an innings and the third Test was drawn, sealing the series 1\u20130. Jardine had a top score of just 38 in the series, but only batted four times and was not out in three of the innings. At the beginning of the following season, Wisden's editor believed that, as Jardine had failed to impress (unspecified) people with his captaincy, he was no longer a certainty to lead the side to Australia, and only Percy Chapman's lack of form prevented his reinstatement at Jardine's expense. As a batsman, Jardine was more impressive in Wisden's opinion, showing himself to be good in defence despite his lack of cricket in the past two seasons. A notable innings was his 104 for The Rest to prevent defeat against champion county Yorkshire. The opposition bowling, particularly from Bill Bowes, was short and hostile, but Jardine survived for over four hours.Douglas, p. 100. He scored 1,104 first-class runs for the season at an average of 64.94."]}, {"page": "Cricket in Scotland", "response": ["Another notable Scottish cricketer was Brian Hardie, who was a major contributor to the successful Essex side of the 70's and 80's.

Ian Peebles, a teammate of Allen's at Middlesex and later a journalist, said of him: \"Allen's impact [as an administrator at Lord's] was immediate and it was the foundation of a remarkable career in the course of which he was to initiate and sponsor measures which affected every possible aspect of the game.\""]}, {"page": "Mike Denness", "response": ["Scotland did not have a representative international team at the time of Denness' career, so he could only play for England at Test and ODI level.

He took match figures of 2/65, his first wicket being Jack Hobbs, and in his first Test innings as a batsman, he hit the first ball for a boundary but was dismissed off the next ball, before scoring 49 in the second innings as Australia chased 428 for victory. McCabe and Don Bradman were scoring quickly and had taken the score to 3/229 when McCabe lofted Maurice Tate towards mid-on. Syd Copley, a member of the ground staff who was acting as a substitute fielder dived forward and took a difficult catch. McCabe's dismissal sparked a collapse of 7/104 as England took a 93-run win.Harte and Whimpress,  p. 324. McCabe scored 44 and an unbeaten 25 as Australia squared the series with a seven-wicket triumph in the Second Test at Lords. McCabe made 30 in a rain-affected draw in the Third Test, before scoring four and taking 4/41 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, removing Ranjitsinhji, Maurice Leyland, Maurice Tate and Ian Peebles to reduce England to 8/251 in another wash out.Harte and Whimpress,  p. 326. With the series locked at 1\u20131, the Fifth and final Test at The Oval was a timeless Test. McCabe scored his first Test half-century of 54 as Australia piled on 695 to win by an innings and reclaim the Ashes 2\u20131.Harte and Whimpress,  p. 327. McCabe took one wicket in the deciding match, bowling leading English batsman Wally Hammond for 13. In all, McCabe scored 210 runs at 35.00 and took eight wickets at 27.62 in the Tests, and aggregated 1012 runs at 32.64 and took 26 wickets at 27.80 for the whole tour. This made him the fifth highest run-scorer for the tour.Harte and Whimpress,  pp. 327\u2013328. However, he was unable to register a century on tour, his highest score being 96. He continued his habit of failing to convert his starts into centuries in the tour matches after the start of the Tests. In one stretch of eight county innings, he registered scores between 34 and 79 seven times, and he ended with seven fifties for the tour. Nevertheless, Wisden praised his attacking ability to disrupt the length of opposition bowlers. On two occasions, McCabe took more than two wickets in an innings."]}, {"page": "Norm O'Neill", "response": ["Nevertheless, O'Neill was selected to make his debut in the five-Test series against England, playing in all of the matches. The First Test in Brisbane was a low scoring match described by Australian captain Richie Benaud as producing \"some of the slowest and worst cricket imaginable\", O'Neill made 34 in Australia's first innings of 186 to help secure a lead of 52. He then top-scored with an unbeaten 71 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory. O'Neill scored 71 of the last 89 runs scored while he was at the crease, refusing to be dried up by the England's usage of leg theory. It enlivened a match plagued by time-wasting, and best remembered for a depressingly slow innings by England's Trevor Bailey, who scored 68 from 426 balls in seven and a half hours.Benaud, p. 155.Haigh, pp. 119\u2013122. England captain Peter May described O'Neill's innings as \"sparkling\" and said that it made \"everything which had gone before look even more wretched\". Retired English player Ian Peebles, writing in the Sunday Times, said \"Although O'Neill is in the very early stages of his career, it is already something of an occasion when he comes to the wicket, and one can sense the expectancy of the crowd and the heightened tension of the opposition\".Haigh, p. 120. Wisden opined that O'Neill had \"saved a game that had been tortuous for days\".

S. Marriott, The Times, 15 October 1966, p.10. He bowled with a high bowling action, swinging his arm behind his back before he delivered the ball in a style which Wisden compared to Kent's great spin bowler Colin Blythe. He bowled an \"immaculate length\" at slow or medium pace and was \"highly disciplined\" in his approach to bowling, having developed his skills through what The Times called \"endless practice\". He used \"cunning flighting\" and \"the ability to turn the ball sharply\" to be an effective bowler \"even on good pitches\" and could be \"unplayable\" on helpful pitches. He bowled a \"fierce\" top-spinner and although he was able to bowl an effective googly, he used it relatively rarely, having injured himself at school whilst bowling the delivery.Haigh G (2002) Mystery Spinner: The life ad Death of an Extraordinary Cricketer. London: Aurum Press. (Available online. Retrieved 17 December 2018.) If he did bowl the delivery it was generally during the first few overs of a spell to act as a deterrent to batsmen.

Wardle's piece was written confrontationally, as a series of sentences starting with \"I accuse\". This was followed by more anti-Meckiff comments in the English press, including one that dubbed the bowler \"the greatest ogre of international cricket since Larwood\". The Evening News proclaimed: \"Meckiff's throwing was devastating\" and The Star said: \"at least two of his wickets were obtained by deliveries which looked to be thrown\". Former England spinner Ian Peebles asserted that Meckiff and Gordon Rorke threw \"the greater number of balls they deliver\",Haigh and Frith, p. 120. while former English paceman Alf Gover claimed that none of the left-armer's deliveries were legal; it was \"ridiculous that a player of his action should be the agent of England's destruction\".Pollard, p. 181.
