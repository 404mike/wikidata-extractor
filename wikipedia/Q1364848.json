He was found guilty and fined 50 talents.Plutarch, Demosthenes, 26.1. Unable to pay this huge amount, Demosthenes escaped and only returned to Athens nine months later, after the death of Alexander. Upon his return, he \"received from his countrymen an enthusiastic welcome, such as had never been accorded to any returning exile since the days of Alkibiades.\" Such a reception, the circumstances of the case, Athenian need to placate Alexander, the urgency to account for the missing funds, Demosthenes' patriotism and wish to set Greece free from Macedonian rule, all lend support to George Grote's view that Demosthenes was innocent, that the charges against him were politically-motivated, and that he \"was neither paid nor bought by Harpalus.\"", "The fact that Demosthenes fought at the battle of Chaeronea as a hoplite indicates that he lacked any military skills. According to historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, in his time the division between political and military offices was beginning to be strongly marked.T.B. Macaulay, On Mitford's History of Greece, 136. Almost no politician, with the exception of Phocion, was at the same time an apt orator and a competent general. Demosthenes dealt in policies and ideas, and war was not his business. This contrast between Demosthenes' intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of vigour, stamina, military skill and strategic vision is illustrated by the inscription his countrymen engraved on the base of his statue:Plutarch, Demosthenes, 30* C.Carey, Aeschines, 12\u201314; K. Paparregopoulus, Ab, 396\u2013398.Had you for Greece been strong, as wise you were, the Macedonian would not have conquered her.George Grote notes that already thirty years before his death, Demosthenes \"took a sagacious and provident measure of the danger which threatened Grecian liberty from the energy and encroachments of Philip.\" Throughout his career \"we trace the same combination of earnest patriotism with wise and long-sighted policy.\" Had his advice to the Athenians and other fellow Greeks been followed, the power of Macedonia could have been successfully checked. Moreover, says Grote, \"it was not Athens only that he sought to defend against Philip, but the whole Hellenic world. In this he towers above the greatest of his predecessors.\"  The sentiments to which Demosthenes appeals throughout his numerous orations, are those of the noblest and largest patriotism; trying to inflame the ancient Grecian sentiment of an autonomous Hellenic world, as the indispensable condition of a dignified and desirable existence.", "h.  Aeschines maintained that Demosthenes was bribed to drop his charges against Meidias in return for a payment of thirty mnai. Plutarch argued that Demosthenes accepted the bribe out of fear of Meidias's power.Aeschines, Against Ctesiphon, 52 ; Plutarch, Demosthenes, 12.2 * E.M. Harris, \"Demosthenes' Speech against Meidias\", 118. Philipp August B\u00f6ckh also accepted Aeschines's account for an out-of-court settlement, and concluded that the speech was never delivered. B\u00f6ckh's position was soon endorsed by Arnold Schaefer and Blass. Weil agreed that Demosthenes never delivered Against Meidias, but believed that he dropped the charges for political reasons. In 1956, Hartmut Erbse partly challenged B\u00f6ckh's conclusions, when he argued that Against Meidias was a finished speech that could have been delivered in court, but Erbse then sided with George Grote, by accepting that, after Demosthenes secured a judgment in his favour, he reached some kind of settlement with Meidias. Kenneth Dover also endorsed Aeschines's account, and argued that, although the speech was never delivered in court, Demosthenes put into circulation an attack on Meidias. Dover's arguments were refuted by Edward M. Harris, who concluded that, although we cannot be sure about the outcome of the trial, the speech was delivered in court, and that Aeschines' story was a lie.E.M.

A supporter of William Pitt the Younger, his participation in Parliament cannot be identified, for the parliamentary records and writings always refer to \"Mr. Mitford\" in the case of both his brother and himself, and the former seems to have been more active than our author. The detectable interventions of William Mitford, on the other hand, are rare and always close to the positions of his brother, who was the one who made a successful political career. Apart from three speeches on rural militia laws, we could not identify any other individual intervention.  This situation clearly differentiates him from George Grote, who was a frequent participant in parliamentary debates.

Clinton, too, in his Fasti hellenici, charged Mitford with \"a general negligence of dates,\" though admitting that in his philosophical range \"he is far superior to any former writer\" on Greek history.
