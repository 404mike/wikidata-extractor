Following his retirement, as a manager and coach he worked at Watford, Millwall, Crystal Palace, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Preston North End and Aston Villa, as well as working with the England national football team under Graham Taylor.He moved to Middlesrough in 2001 following the appointment of Steve McClaren and in 2003 he was appointed as the team's defensive coach. Harrison took on a more general role after Gareth Southgate took over, but left the club in July 2008 after suffering health problems in recent years. He has since recovered from his health problems and on 22 May 2009 he took up the role of assistant to Chris Coleman at Coventry City. On 4 May 2010 Harrison was named caretaker manager of the club after Coleman was sacked, returning to his role as assistant manager on 20 May with the appointment of Aidy Boothroyd as manager. On 14 March 2011 he was again appointed caretaker manager, following Boothroyd's sacking. In June 2012 Harrison parted company with the Sky Blues as a result of the strict cost-cutting measures implemented by the club's owners.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Watford F.C.", "response": ["Following Taylor's departure, Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett was appointed as his replacement, and England winger John Barnes was sold to Liverpool. After 4 wins from his opening 23 league fixtures, Bassett was sacked in January 1988. Watford were bottom of the First Division at the time of his departure, and Steve Harrison could not prevent relegation at the end of the season. In 1988\u201389, Harrison's Watford failed to return to the First Division, after defeat in the Second Division play-offs. The under-18 team won the FA Youth Cup, beating Manchester City 2\u20131 after extra time, with future England international David James in goal for the Hornets. Harrison departed in 1990, and over the next few years, the closest Watford came to promotion was a seventh-placed finish in Division One in the 1994\u201395 season. However, in the following season \u2013 Glenn Roeder's third as manager \u2013 Watford struggled. Despite the return of Graham Taylor as caretaker manager in February 1996, the club was relegated to Division Two.", "Graham Taylor took charge of Watford in 1977. He led the club to promotion to the Third Division in 1978, the Second Division in 1979, and the First Division for the first time in Watford's history in 1982. After a second-placed finish in the First Division in 1983, Watford competed in European competition for the first time in 1983\u201384, as well as reaching the 1984 FA Cup final. Taylor left the club at the end of 1986\u201387. Under the six subsequent permanent managers (Dave Bassett, Steve Harrison, Colin Lee, Steve Perryman, Glenn Roeder and Kenny Jackett), Watford slid from 9th in the top tier in 1987, to 13th in the third tier in 1997. Taylor returned as manager for the start of the 1997\u201398 season. He led the club to consecutive promotions, but could not prevent relegation from the Premier League in 1999\u20132000. Since Taylor's retirement in 2001, Watford have had twelve managers. Of these, Aidy Boothroyd took Watford back to the Premier League in 2006, but Watford were relegated in 2007, and Boothroyd departed in 2008.\"Boothroyd & Watford part company\".

In July 1990 Watford signed Mark Gavin from Bristol City for a fee for \u00a3250,000 and Allison, who was valued at \u00a3150,000, went to City in exchange.

He was a pacey striker with good shooting ability. He started his career at Watford, who finished ninth in the First Division in 1986\u201387 under Graham Taylor's stewardship, before suffering relegation in 1987\u201388 under Dave Bassett and then Steve Harrison. He was loaned out to Carlisle United towards the end of the campaign, and scored once in four Fourth Division games for Clive Middlemass. He joined John Rudge's Port Vale in March, and scored twice at Vale Park in six Third Division appearances. He started 1988\u201389 on loan at Terry Yorath's Swansea City, and returned to Vicarage Road after one goal in five Third Division games.
