Once he left school, at age 14, he started working in Rylands. His first professional club was Manchester City, who he joined from amateur side Greenwood Victoria in August 1949. He did not make his league debut until more than three years later, playing against Liverpool at Anfield in January 1953. He made five further appearances that season, but the following season he displaced Jack Hannaway to become first choice full-back. Under the Revie Plan, Little formed a defensive partnership with Jimmy Meadows, as Manchester City reached consecutive FA Cup finals."]}]}}
