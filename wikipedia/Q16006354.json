Preece and Hepworth became friendly with Spencer and his wife, sometimes minding their daughters and joining their art picnics.  Carline's brother Richard was attracted and took Preece dining and dancing, until he understood the nature of her relationship with Hepworth. Hepworth's parents lost their fortune in the Great Depression, and from 1930, after Preece's father died, Preece and Hepworth were struggling to make mortgage payments. Spencer introduced Preece to his extensive art-world contacts. In May 1933, Spencer's cosmopolitan patron, Edward Beddington-Behrens invited Preece to travel with Stanley to Switzerland for a commission (Preece spoke fluent French, while Stanley spoke none). In 1933, Preece first modelled for Spencer, sitting for Portrait of Patricia Preece.Spencer, Stanley. \"Portrait of Patricia Preece\", James Hyman Fine Art and Photographs, accessed 27 May 2013 By 1934, Spencer was concerned about Preece's finances and deteriorating health. He suggested that Preece and Hepworth move into the top floor of his house, but they did not do so. Carline was also concerned about their artist friends but was already suspicious of Spencer's relationship with Preece. Nevertheless, in 1934, Spencer persuaded Carline to paint a portrait of Preece. The resulting image shows both Carline's ambivalent feelings about Preece and the latter's change in demeanour since her more lighthearted days of financial independence."]}, {"page": "1953 Coronation Honours", "response": ["* Major Edward Beddington-Behrens  For services to the Economic League for European Co-operation"]}, {"page": "1957 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Major Edward Beddington-Behrens, CMG, MC.
