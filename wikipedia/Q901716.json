Dunlop was director of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association (BEAMA), and chairman of the executive council of the World Power Conference. Dunlop had called Stein to London to take up a post in research for the World Power Conference; he had apparently founded the World Power Conference as a precursor to a World Economic Conference, and he had called Stein to London to assist him especially with this latter, more ambitious, project. Dunlop died in 1935 before this plan could be brought to fruition, but Stein did bring about Dunlop's wish for an independent cultural journal in the form of The Present Age. Stein, having taken up various studies in economics, geography, and geology for his collaborative work with Dunlop, was able to bring together the results of this work in a special issue of the journal under the title The Earth as a Basis of World Economy. The publication of the journal ceased with the start of the Second World War."]}, {"page": "D. N.

He wanted to gather experts from all around the world to discuss current and future energy issues. He organised in 1923 first national committees, which organised the first World Power Conference (WPC) in 1924. 1,700 experts from 40 countries met in London to discuss energy issues. The meeting was a success and the participants decided on July 11, 1924 to establish a permanent organisation named World Power Conference. Dunlop was elected as its first Secretary General. In 1968 the name was changed to World Energy Conference, and in 1989 it became the World Energy Council.Wright, Rebecca; Shin, Hiroki; Trentmann, Frank (2013).
