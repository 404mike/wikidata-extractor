He married in 1819, to convict Hannah Dodd. His first business interests were a general store, an adjoining inn, a small investment in shipping, and a brewery. His fortune developed when he became a partner in the firm of Hutchinson, Terry and Co., (also known as the Waterloo Co.) and in 1825 he and Solomon Levey became the sole owners of the firm, which became generally known as Cooper and Levey. The firm continued to have spectacular success, expanding into importing a full range of goods, pioneering the export of Australian wool, and investing in whaling and sealing expeditions. The firm's ships visited many parts of the coast of New Zealand, and other places such as Tahiti. Port Cooper and Port Levy on Banks Peninsula were named for them but the former was renamed Port Victoria by the surveyors of the Canterbury Association, though it subsequently became known as Lyttelton Harbour, after its port town, Lyttelton. Among other properties, the firm acquired the estate of Captain John Piper, which included more than 1,100 acres (4.5 km2) at Woollahra and Rose Bay.He built Cleveland House in Surry Hills in about 1823\u201324.In 1826 Levey left Sydney for England to further the firm's business interests. While he was there, he became involved with Thomas Peel in the colonisation of Western Australia, which was a financial disaster for him, and did not return. Cooper continued to manage the firm. Cooper also built up a personal fortune in real estate, independent of his interest in the firm. He countered the efforts of the Bank of New South Wales to force his firm out of the banking business, and was elected a Governor of the Bank in 1828. In October 1831 Cooper sailed for England. He undertook a general supervision of the firm from England, and appointed managers in Sydney. He died at Brighton, England, on 3 November 1853. His third wife Alice survived him. He had no children but had taken great interest in the education and business training of a nephew who bore his own name (later Sir Daniel Cooper, baronet) and this nephew was his major heir. His nephew became the speaker for the first parliament of New South Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Waterloo, New South Wales", "response": ["In the 1820s Waterloo began supporting industrial operations including the Fisher and Duncan Paper Mill and the Waterloo Flour Mills owned by William Hutchinson and Daniel Cooper. William Hutchinson, superintendent of convicts and public works, had been granted  of land in 1823. He sold Waterloo Farm to Daniel Cooper (1785\u20131853) and Solomon Levey (1794\u20131833). Cooper later bought out Levey's share and on his death the Waterloo Estate passed onto his nephew, also named Daniel Cooper, who was the first speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 266"]}, {"page": "Lyttelton, New Zealand", "response": ["In 1850, four ships (the Randolph, Cressy, Sir George Seymour, and Charlotte Jane) arrived in Lyttelton Harbour, carrying the first what was to be known as the 'Canterbury pilgrims'. The arrival of the four ships had swelled Lyttelton's population to around 1,100. Over the next three years, 3,549 settlers arrived in Lyttelton. Lyttelton was formerly called Port Cooper (after Daniel Cooper) and Port Victoria. It was the original settlement in the district (1850). The name Lyttelton was formalised by the governor in 1858 in honour of George William Lyttelton of the Canterbury Association, which had led the colonisation of the area."]}, {"page": "Bellevue Hill, New South Wales", "response": ["The area became part of Daniel Cooper's estate, who passed most of it  on his death in 1853 to his nephew, Sir Daniel Cooper. From the mid-19th century, land along the ridges was released, leading to the construction of the first houses, such as Ginahgulla (owned by the Fairfax family responsible for establishing the Fairfax Media empire) and Cranbrook. The lack of public transport but preponderance of scenic views led to the area being aimed at those without the need for the former but with the appreciation for the latter."]}]}}
