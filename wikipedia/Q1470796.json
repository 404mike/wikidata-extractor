Victorian morality judged literature as superior to painting, because of its \u201cnoble grounds for noble emotion.\u201d Robert Buchanan (a writer and opponent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) felt so strongly about this artistic hierarchy that he wrote: \u201cThe truth is that literature, and more particularly poetry, is in a very bad way when one art gets hold of another, and imposes upon it its conditions and limitations.\" as cited in Welland, D.S.R. The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art. London, UK: George G. Harrap & Co. Ltd., 14. This was the hostile environment in which Pre-Raphaelites were defiantly working in various media. The Pre-Raphaelites attempted to revitalize subject painting, which had been dismissed as artificial. Their belief that each picture should tell a story was an important step for the unification of painting and literature (eventually deemed the Sister Arts), or at least a break in the rigid hierarchy promoted by writers like Robert Buchanan."]}, {"page": "Norwich School of painters", "response": ["File:Sandys - Study of the head of a young mulatto woman -full face.jpg|Frederick Sandys, Study of the head of a young mulatto woman  full face (c. 1859), Art Gallery of New South Wales", "*Frederick Sandys"]}, {"page": "Cheyne Walk", "response": ["* Frederick Sandys, painter, as Rossetti's housemate 1866\u201367."]}, {"page": "Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery", "response": ["Sandys, Frederick - Morgan le Fay.JPG|Frederick Sandys, Morgan le Fay, 1864 ", "Medea-Sandys.jpg|Frederick Sandys, Medea"]}, {"page": "Walter Crane", "response": ["Crane was the second son of Thomas Crane, a portrait painter and miniaturist, and Marie Crane (n\u00e9e Kearsley), the daughter of a prosperous malt-maker.

He was a fluent follower of the newer art movements and he came to study and appreciate the detailed senses of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and was also a diligent student of the renowned artist and critic John Ruskin. A set of coloured page designs to illustrate Tennyson's \"Lady of Shalott\" gained the approval of wood-engraver William James Linton to whom Walter Crane was apprenticed for three years in 1859\u201362. As a wood-engraver he had abundant opportunity for the minute study of the contemporary artists whose work passed through his hands, of Pre-Raphaelites Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais, as well as Sir John Tenniel, the illustrator of Alice in Wonderland, and Frederick Sandys. He was a student who admired the masters of the Italian Renaissance, however he was more influenced by the Elgin marbles in the British Museum. A further and important element in the development of his talent was the study of Japanese colour-prints, the methods of which he imitated in a series of toy books, which started a new fashion."]}, {"page": "1864 in art", "response": ["* Frederick Sandys \u2013 Morgan le Fay"]}, {"page": "1868 in art", "response": ["* Frederick Sandys \u2013 Medea"]}]}}
