At this time, Redknapp had also become one of the mass-marketed poster boy icons of the newly developing FA Premier League where, alongside other photogenic young players like Manchester United players Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe, he was used ceaselessly in commercials, advertising spots and for the league's promotional purposes in merchandising and sales, with the result being that football stars had become idols on par with rock stars and pop stars, by and around the mid to late 1990s."]}, {"page": "John Barnes", "response": ["Souness later stated in his autobiography that Barnes due to his injuries was now taking a \"less demanding\" central midfield playmaker's role as opposed to a goalscoring winger.
