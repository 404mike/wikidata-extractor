The lai, preserved in a single late-thirteenth-century manuscript in the Bodleian library, tells the story of a drinking-horn which cannot be used by cuckolded husbands without spilling the contents.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anglo-Norman literature", "response": ["The interinfluence of French and English literature can be studied in the Breton romances and the romans d'aventure even better than in the epic poetry of the period. The Lay of Orpheus is known to us only through an English imitation, Sir Orfeo; the Lai du cor was composed by Robert Biket, an Anglo-Norman poet of the 12th century (Wulff, Lund, 1888). The Lais of Marie de France were written in England, and the greater number of the romances composing the mati\u00e8re de Bretagne seem to have passed from England to France through the medium of Anglo-Norman."]}, {"page": "Roman de Brut", "response": ["The emphasis Wace placed on the rivalries between his knights and on the role of love in their lives had a profound effect on writers of his own and later generations.  His influence can be seen in some of the very earliest romances, including the Roman d'En\u00e9as and the Roman de Troie, and in Renaud de Beaujeu's Le Bel Inconnu and the works of Gautier d'Arras.  Thomas of Britain's romance Tristan draws on the Brut for historical details, particularly the story of Gormon, and follows its example in matters of style.  His influence is especially evident in the field of Arthurian romance, later writers taking up his hint that many tales are told of the Round Table and that each of its members is equally renowned.  There are general resemblances between the Brut and the poems of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, in that both are Arthurian narratives in octosyllabic couplets, as well as stylistic similarities, but there are also specific signs of Chr\u00e9tien's debt.  He adapts Geoffrey's narrative of Mordred's last campaign against Arthur in his romance of Clig\u00e8s, and various passages in the Brut contribute to his account of the festivities at Arthur's court in Erec and Enide.{{sfn|Arnold|1938|p=xcvi</ref>  There are likewise verbal reminiscences of the Brut in Philomela and Guillaume d'Angleterre, two poems sometimes attributed to Chr\u00e9tien.  It is certain that Marie de France had read Wace, but less certain how many passages in her Lais show its influence, only the raids by the Picts and Scots in Lanval being quite unambiguous.  Two of the Breton lais written in imitation of Marie de France also show clear signs of indebtedness to the Brut.  It gave to Robert Biket's Lai du Cor certain elements of its style and several circumstantial details, and to the anonymous Melion a number of plot-points.  The description of Tintagel in the Folie Tristan d'Oxford included details taken from the Roman de Brut.  In the early 13th century Le Chevalier aux Deux Epees was still demonstrating the influence the Roman de Brut could exert.  In this case the author seems to have been impressed by Wace's account of Arthur's birth, character, battles, and tragic death.  Robert de Boron based his verse romance Merlin, which only survives in fragmentary form, on the Roman de Brut, with some additions from the Historia Regum Britanniae, and also drew on the Brut for his prose romance Didot Perceval.  The story of Robert's Merlin was continued in the prose Suite Merlin, one of the romances in the Lancelot-Grail or Vulgate Cycle, which likewise takes and adapts Wace's narrative, especially when describing Arthur's Roman war.  The final sections of the Mort Artu, another Vulgate romance, take their narrative basis from Wace's account of the end of Arthur's reign, and his influence also appears in the Livre d'Artus, a romance loosely associated with the Vulgate Cycle.  Much later, the mid-15th century Recueil des croniques et anchiennes istories de la Grant Bretaigne by Jean de Wavrin, a compilation of earlier chronicles, takes its British history up to the beginning of the Arthurian period from an anonymous French adaptation of Wace's Brut dating from c. 1400, though with substantial additions taken from the romances."]}, {"page": "Robert Biquet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Biket"]}, {"page": "Biket, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Biket"]}]}}
