Begley was killed when a bomb he was planting on the Shankill Road, West Belfast, Northern Ireland exploded prematurely, killing him, a UDA member and eight Protestant civilians.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Johnny Adair", "response": ["The BBC described Adair as \"the most controversial, high-profile and ubiquitous\" of all the paramilitaries operating in Northern Ireland during this period.\"Johnny Adair: Notorious loyalist\" , BBC News. 10 January 2003; retrieved 21 September 2012. The IRA's Shankill Road Bombing of a fish shop in October 1993 was an attempt to assassinate Adair and the rest of the UDA's Belfast leadership in reprisal for attacks on Catholics. The office above the shop was the UDA's Shankill headquarters and a meeting was due to take place shortly after the bomb exploded.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack.

Part 2: Taking Down 'Mad Dog'. The bomb detonated prematurely, killing one of the two IRA men, Thomas Begley, and nine Protestants (a UDA volunteer and eight civilians). The UDA retaliated by carrying out the Greysteel massacre in County Londonderry, an attack on the Rising Sun, a bar in a majority Catholic area, in which eight civilians, six of whom were Catholic and two of whom were Protestants, were shot dead. While Adair was targeted for assassination a number of times, he frequently exaggerated the number of attempts.Adair profile , theguardian.com, 5 October 2003; accessed 28 December 2015."]}]}}
