Butler then transferred the land to create a privately owned burial ground, which was opened in 1842. The cemetery was never consecrated.  There were two chapels in the cemetery, designed by the architect Arthur Ashpitel, both of which have since been demolished. The surviving Gothic arch gateway (with the inscription 'VPC 1845') was restored in 2017."]}]}}
