His instruments include the saxophone, accordion, clarinet, zurna and flute. Dubbed the \"hardest working man in British jazz\", Atzmon has been known to play over 100 dates a year. He has been bandleader, successively, of the Gilad Atzmon Quartet, the Spiel Acid Jazz Band and the Orient House Ensemble. Exploring identity through the folk forms of diverse cultures, his bands and other projects have recorded around 20 albums. Since 1998, he has also been a member of the English rock band, The Blockheads. He has played on albums by Pink Floyd and Robert Wyatt and collaborated with other musicians on their recordings. He has also produced albums for Sarah Gillespie, Norman Watt-Roy and others.\nAtzmon has written satirical novels, non-fiction works and read essays on the subjects of Palestinian rights, Israel and identity politics.

He shows how assimilation and liberalism are making it increasingly difficult for Jews in the Diaspora to maintain a powerful sense of their 'Jewishness.'

We have obvious anti-Semites rightfully categorized like Hitler & the major Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, Holocaust deniers, and Neo-Nazis, but others are certainly more ambiguous ('anti-Zionists,' etc). For instance, in regards to ambiguity, I just removed the controversial American academic Kevin B. MacDonald from the category because it has never been definitively 'proven' that he is indeed an anti-Semite, and I have placed him under the more specific :Category:Scholars of antisemitism (because he has written scholarly books on the subject of anti-Semitism). I think that it's fairly correct to say that he indeed harbors some anti-Semitic views (or views that are thought to be anti-Semitic by most), but it is not up to us here on Wikipedia to INFER things like this, but yet he continues to be wrongfully placed in this category. There is a disclaimer that states: \"Adding this category to an article is in no way intended to imply that the subject of the article is antisemitic,\" but in all reality adding this category to an person's article is indeed tantamount to labeling a person/group/event as anti-Semitic. Others individuals in this category include Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Gilad Atzmon, Charley Reese, Lenora Fulani, Horst Mahler, and a host of others (just scroll through the category and look for individual names). Again, I think that we must be VERY CAREFUL about adding this category to the articles of living people lest Wikipedia be damaged by even more controversies that involve mislabeling/miscategorizing living people through the spreading of potentially damning information (even if it is not true!). It's best to let history decide stuff like this, I think. --Wassermann 12:52, 5 May 2007 (UTC)"]}, {"page": "Ten More Turnips from the Tip", "response": ["* Gilad Atzmon - saxophones"]}, {"page": "Atzmon (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Gilad Atzmon (born 1963), Israeli musician and author"]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish entertainers", "response": ["*Gilad Atzmon, pro-Palestinian activist and saxophonist for The Blockheads.
