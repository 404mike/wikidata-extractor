He played as a left half.\nFraser was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire. He played football for Glasgow Nomads and for former Scottish Football League club Northern, before coming to England to join Football League First Division club Small Heath in November 1895. He made his debut on 30 November in an 8\u20130 defeat at Derby County, but kept his place, and was ever-present for the remainder of the season. Fraser finished his Small Heath career with an 8\u20130 win, against Manchester City in the test matches which determined Small Heath's relegation to the Second Division. He then returned to Scotland and signed for Heart of Midlothian, but never played for their first team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fraser (surname)", "response": ["*Adam Fraser (1871\u20131???), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1895\u201396 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["The directors changed their minds, and sent secretary Alf Jones and player Jack Oliver to Scotland on a recruitment mission.

Meanwhile, after a casual start, Small Heath came back from a three-goal deficit to beat Leyton 8\u20133 in a friendly. Winning ways continued in the League as they beat Nottingham Forest with a goal in the first five minutes, scored by Hands from a Hallam centre. Roach's performance in goal suggested he was the best of the four tried thus far, and Frank Lester made a promising debut at back, but both teams' forwards were disappointing.", "The Nottinghamshire Guardian suggested Small Heath would \"have to greatly improve their present team if they are to make a very prominent display even in [the second] division next season.\" Harry Haynes moved on to Southern League club Southampton St Mary's, Ted Devey left for Burton Wanderers, and Adam Fraser returned to Scotland, but the major loss was that of Fred Wheldon.
