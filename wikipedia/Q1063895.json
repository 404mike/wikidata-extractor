C. Massey was a British barrister, Christian mystic and psychical researcher.Massey was born at Hackwood Park, Basingstoke. He was the first president of the British Theosophical Society and a founding member of the Society for Psychical Research in 1882. His father was William Nathaniel Massey. His main interest was Christian Theosophy, he was influenced by the writings of Jakob Bohme.Massey a convinced spiritualist was associated with the medium Stainton Moses. He was also a member of the British National Association of Spiritualists and The Ghost Club.Massey had defended the medium Henry Slade against the accusations of fraud from Ray Lankester. In 1880 he translated Johann Karl Friedrich Z\u00f6llner's Transcendental Physics into English.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Johann Karl Friedrich Z\u00f6llner", "response": ["The experiments were recorded by Z\u00f6llner in a book titled Transcendental Physics in 1878. According to Z\u00f6llner some of the experiments were a success.Stein, Gordon. (1996). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 703.  \"Slade succeeded only on tests that allowed easy trickery, such as producing knots in cords that had their ends tied together and the knot sealed, putting wooden rings on a table leg, and removing coins from sealed boxes. He failed utterly on tests that did not permit deception. He was unable to reverse the spirals of snail shells. He could not link two wooden rings, one of oak, the other of alder. He could not knot an endless ring cut from a bladder, or put a piece of candle inside a closed glass bulb. He failed to change the optical handedness of tartaric dex-tro to levo. These tests would have been easy to pass if Slade 's spirit controls had been able to take an object into the fourth dimension, then return it after making the required manipulations. Such successes would have created marvelous PPOs (permanent paranormal objects), difficult for skeptics to explain. Z\u00f6llner wrote an entire book in praise of Slade. Titled Transcendental Physics (1878), it was partly translated into English in 1880 by spiritualist Charles Carleton Massey. The book is a classic of childlike gullibility by a scientist incapable of devising adequate controls for testing paranormal powers.\" However, critics have suggested that the medium Henry Slade was a fraud who performed trickery in the experiments.Baker, Robert A. (1996). Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within. Prometheus Books. p. 233.  \"Unfortunately, Z\u00f6llner became enraptured by the antics of the medium Dr. Henry Slade. Slade, a master prestidigitator and slate writer, was exposed by Professor Lankester as well as by Henry Sidgwick, Edmund Gurney, and W. B. Carpenter.\"Brock, William Hodson. (2008). William Crookes (1832-1919) and the Commercialization of Science. Ashgate. p. 174.  Wilhelm Wundt who attended one of the s\u00e9ances, claimed that the conditions and controls were unsatisfactory. He also found the German grammatical errors on the slates suspicious as Slade was an English speaker."]}, {"page": "College of Psychic Studies", "response": ["In August 1873, the British National Association of Spiritualists (BNAS) was formed by Thomas Everitt, Edmund Rogers and others at a meeting in Liverpool.Oppenheim, Janet. (1988). The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914. Cambridge University Press. p. 53.  \"The British National Association of Spiritualists emerged from a meeting in Liverpool, in August 1873, sponsored by the local Psychological Society. Attendance was not confined to spiritualists from the immediate area, and among the participants were W. H. Harrison and Thomas Everitt from London. The meeting heard several papers advocating the benefits of national organization for the expansion and consolidation of British spiritualism, and these arguments carried the day. The conference resolved to form a national association, and initiative then passed to London, where the following year the BNAS commenced its activities. From 1875, it was comfortably housed at 38 Great Russell Street, the scene of its numerous stances, both public and private, committee meetings, lectures, and social gatherings.\"Lavoie, Jeffrey D.
