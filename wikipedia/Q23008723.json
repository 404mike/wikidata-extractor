She has also published books on art history and art crime.  De Vries was trained as an art historian. In 1996, she was made a Member of the Order of Australia for services to art and literature.  She was born in England then moved to Australia in 1975.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Infanticide", "response": ["Author Susanna de Vries in 2007 told a newspaper that her accounts of Aboriginal violence, including infanticide, were censored by publishers in the 1980s and 1990s.  She told reporters that the censorship \"stemmed from guilt over the stolen children question\".  Keith Windschuttle weighed in on the conversation, saying this type of censorship started in the 1970s.  In the same article Louis Nowra suggested that infanticide in customary Aboriginal law may have been because it was difficult to keep an abundant number of Aboriginal children alive; there were life-and-death decisions modern-day Australians no longer have to face."]}, {"page": "Conrad Martens", "response": ["*Susanna de Vries.

In recent years, her reputation has been rising, and critics today consider her work more adventurous than that of her husband. In 1996, one of her paintings set an auction record of A$105,500  for works by an Australian woman artist, and the following year saw the publication of a biography, Ethel Carrick Fox: Travels and Triumphs of a Post-Impressionist by art historian Susanna de Vries.

On 10 October, the Duke's cousin the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha wrote to him, \"dear David! I hear that you are coming to Germany... I naturally would be delighted if you could take this opportunity to see me; perhaps I could introduce you to a couple of interesting personalities whom you otherwise wouldn't meet\". Hitler and von Ribbentrop planned that, although the tour was a private rather than state visit, the Windsors\u2014particularly the Duchess\u2014were to effectively undertake a royal progress. This was first demonstrated on their arrival, early Monday morning, at Berlin's Friedrichstra\u00dfe station on 11 October. The scholar Susanna de Vries describes how the Duchess \"covered in jewels... did her best to look suitably royal\", dressed in royal blue. They were greeted by Ley, who kissed her hand and called her \"Your Highness\". With Ley was a welcoming delegation including von Ribbentrop and the Gauleiter of Berlin, Artur G\u00f6rlitzer. Also waiting was the British Embassy's Third Secretary to present a letter informing the Duke that the Embassy would not be available to assist him or his wife formally in the course of their visit. Ogilvie-Forbes later visited the Duke in his hotel to pay the personal respects he had been unable to pay him in public."]}, {"page": "1996 in Australian literature", "response": ["* Susanna de Vries  \"for service to art as an author and lecturer in Australian and European art history and history\""]}, {"page": "List of women writers (M\u2013Z)", "response": ["*Susanna de Vries (b. 1936, Australia), biographer"]}]}}
