His father is unknown. He was married to \u00c6thelgyth, daughter of \u00c6thelwulf; \u00c6thelwulf is unidentified, but a possible candidate is King Alfred the Great's brother-in-law, the ealdorman of the Gaini who died in 901. \u00c6thelfrith was father to four ealdormen: \u00c6thelstan Half-King (East Anglia), \u00c6lfstan (Mercia), \u00c6thelwald (Kent), and Eadric (Wessex).\"In 903 it happened to \u00c6thelfrith, dux, that all his deeds of title perished in the destruction of a fire. Therefore impelled by such a necessity, the aforementioned dux asked King Edward, also \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, who then held rulership and power over the Mercian people under the aforementioned king, also all the members of the witan, that they should permit him and give authorisation for the rewriting of replacement charters for him.\" Among the charters reissued was one \"concerning that land of ten hides, namely at Islington, which Coenwulf, the celebrated king of the Mercians, gave to his faithful comes, Beornnoth, to be free for himself and for his heirs in perpetuity after him\". It would appear therefore that \u00c6thelfrith, or possibly his, wife, could trace his family roots to the old Mercian aristocracy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "\u00c6thelweard (historian)", "response": ["It has been postulated that \u00c6thelweard and his siblings \u00c6lfweard, \u00c6lfgifu and \u00c6lfwaru were the children of Eadric, ealdorman of Hampshire.

One theory espoused by Cyril Hart and considered by Pauline Stafford makes her a noblewoman of Mercian stock, who descended from Ealdorman \u00c6thelfrith of MerciaS 367, 367a, 371. and his wife \u00c6thelgyth,PASE s.v.  who may have been a daughter of ealdorman \u00c6thelwulf and a niece of King Alfred's Mercian consort Ealhswith.S 1442. PASE s.v.  /  This reconstruction is based on the probability that Risborough (Buckinghamshire), one of \u00c6lfgifu's holdings mentioned in the will, was previously held by \u00c6thelgyth.S 367 and S 1484. The possible implication is that \u00c6lfgifu inherited the estate and many others in Buckinghamshire. Given that she asked Bishop \u00c6thelwold, one of her beneficiaries, to intercede for her \"mother's soul\", she may have done so through the maternal line. If the suggestion is correct, she would have been closely related to the politically prominent family of ealdorman \u00c6thelstan Half-King and his offspring.Hart, Cyril, The Danelaw, p. 462, etc. and 569\u2013604; Stafford, \"\u00c6lfgifu\"; Whitelock, Anglo-Saxon Wills; p. 119"]}, {"page": "Aethelfrith of Wessex", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c6thelfrith of Mercia"]}, {"page": "AEthelfrith of Wessex", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c6thelfrith of Mercia "]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelfrith of Wessex", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c6thelfrith of Mercia"]}, {"page": "AEthelfrith of Mercia", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c6thelfrith of Mercia"]}, {"page": "Aethelfrith of Mercia", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c6thelfrith of Mercia "]}]}}
