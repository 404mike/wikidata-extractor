It was a time when British world maps showed the Empire in red and pink to highlight British imperial power spanning the globe. Scottish author, John Wilson, writing as \"Christopher North\" in Blackwood's Magazine in 1829, is sometimes credited as originating the usage. However, George Macartney wrote in 1773, in the wake of the territorial expansion that followed Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War, of \"this vast empire on which the sun never sets, and whose bounds nature has not yet ascertained.\"; cited in "]}, {"page": "Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian", "response": ["Florian imitated Salomon Gessner, the Swiss idyllist, and his style has all the artificial delicacy and sentimentality of the Gessnerian school. Perhaps the nearest example of the class in English literature is afforded by John Wilson's  Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life (written as Christopher North). Among the best of his fables are reckoned The Monkey showing the Magic Lantern, The Blind Man and the Paralytic, and The Monkeys and the Leopard."]}, {"page": "Blackwood's Magazine", "response": ["Blackwood's was conceived as a rival to the Whig-supporting Edinburgh Review. Compared to the rather staid tone of The Quarterly Review, the other main Tory work, Maga was ferocious and combative. This is due primarily to the work of its principal writer John Wilson, who wrote under the pseudonym of Christopher North. Never trusted with the editorship, he nevertheless wrote much of the magazine along with the other major contributors John Gibson Lockhart and William Maginn. Their mixture of satire, reviews and criticism both barbed and insightful was extremely popular and the magazine quickly gained a large audience.", "By the mid-1820s Lockhart and Maginn had departed to London, the former to edit the Quarterly and the latter to write for a range of journals, though principally for Fraser's Magazine. After this, John Wilson was by far the most important writer for the magazine and gave it much of its tone, popularity and notoriety. In this period Blackwood's became the first British literary journal to publish work by an American with an 1824 essay by John Neal that got reprinted across Europe. Over the following year and a half the magazine published Neal's \"American Writers\" series, which is the first written history of American literature.", "The Blackwood's name lives on in the former home of John Wilson at the Nira Caledonia Hotel in Gloucester Place, Edinburgh. The home he resided from 1827 until his death in 1854."]}, {"page": "Paisley Grammar School", "response": ["*John Wilson (Scottish writer)", "*John Wilson \u2013 Canadian children's author."]}]}}
