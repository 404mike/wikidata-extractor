Knightley researched interviews with Clarke, and sought to keep her \"upper-class quality\", drawing on the depth of her emotions and protectiveness of Turning from the script. The Imitation Game became a critical and commercial success grossing over $233.6 million.-  For her performance, Knightley received her second Academy Award and BAFTA Award nominations, and third Golden Globe Award nomination, all for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Conversly, Lady Jean Forde, who worked with Clarke and Turing, felt Knightley was \"nothing like\" Clarke and was \"too beautiful\" to play her. Knightley's sole release in 2015 was as part of the ensemble cast in the biographical disaster film Everest. The film was based on the 1996 Mount Everest disaster with Knightley portraying mountaineer Rob Hall's wife. Everest opened to generally positive reviews from critics.
