His main reason for supporting cremation was that \"it was becoming a necessary sanitary precaution against the propagation of disease among a population daily growing larger in relation to the area it occupied\". In addition, he believed, cremation would prevent premature burial, reduce the expense of funerals, spare mourners the necessity of standing exposed to the weather during interment, and urns would be safe from vandalism. He joined with other proponents to form the Cremation Society of Great Britain in 1874.\" They founded the United Kingdom's first crematorium in Woking, with Gorini travelling to England to assist the installation of a cremator. They first tested it on 17 March 1879 with the body of a horse. After protests and an intervention by the Home Secretary, Sir Richard Cross, their plans were put on hold. In 1884, the Welsh Neo-Druidic priest William Price was arrested and put on trial for attempting to cremate his son's body. Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The case set a precedent that allowed the Cremation Society to proceed."]}, {"page": "Physician to the Queen", "response": ["* Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet, FRCS (1820\u20131904), Physician to Queen Victoria"]}, {"page": "Thompson baronets", "response": ["*Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet (1820\u20131904)"]}, {"page": "Henry de Candole", "response": ["HHVdeC's mother was Helen (Edith) Thompson (1860-1930), the daughter of Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Henry Francis Herbert Thompson", "response": ["Henry Thompson was born in London on 2 April 1859, the son of Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet and Kate Fanny Loder, the English composer and pianist.
