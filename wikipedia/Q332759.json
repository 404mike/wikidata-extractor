There was to be a complete and supervised withdrawal of Argentine forces\u00a0... matched by corresponding withdrawal of British forces. There is no withdrawal of British force that 'corresponds' to the withdrawal from the territory of the islands of those who have unlawfully occupied them. We have a right to be there; those are our waters, the territory is ours and we have the right to sail the oceans with our fleets whenever we think fit. So the whole notion of a 'corresponding withdrawal', a withdrawal of the only force which can possibly restore the position, which can possibly ensure any of the objectives which have been talked about on either side of the House, is in contradiction of the determination to repossess the Falklands\".Falkland Islands Hansard, 13 May 1982 vol 23 cc952\u20131034."]}, {"page": "Foreign Secretary", "response": ["| Francis Pym"]}, {"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["The Committee's report in September accused Heseltine of having given an \"untrue\" answer on 12 February. Heseltine immediately gave a press conference (7 September 1973) in which he denied that he had lied. On the orders of Chief Whip Francis Pym he apologised to the House of Commons on 16 October 1973 for having made a statement which was open to \"more than one interpretation\". Heseltine said that his statement that further investment was \"under consideration\" was not just the normal euphemism for a decision that had not yet been announced, but was actually technically true, as at that time he was still talking to Hawker Siddeley and British Rail about buying part of the Hovertrain business. The row deflected attention from the committee's anger at the cancellation decision. Neave's real target, in the view of Heseltine's PPS Cecil Parkinson, was Heath, whom Neave detested and later helped to topple as party leader in 1975, but he and Sir Harry Legge-Bourke, both of whom had distinguished war records, also deplored Heseltine's cutting short of his National Service and his brashness and new money."]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for Northern Ireland", "response": ["| Francis PymMP for Cambridgeshire"]}, {"page": "Chevaline", "response": ["The Chevaline project was kept secret by successive UK governments, both Labour and Conservative.
