The team competed in the amateur leagues before gaining entry into the Southern Football League and turning professional in 1910. With growing interest in association football in the traditionally rugby union stronghold of Swansea, the decision was taken to form a club. Swansea Town A.F.C. was founded in 1912 and gained admission into the Second Division of the Southern Football League alongside Cardiff. The two clubs faced each other for the first time on 7 September 1912, in Swansea's first competitive fixture, with the match ending in a 1\u20131 draw; Billy Ball gave the Swans the lead before Cardiff captain John Burton equalised. Swansea went on to claim the first victory between the two sides five months later when they defeated Cardiff 4\u20132 in the semi-final of the Welsh Cup despite trailing 2\u20130 at half time. Cardiff lost two players to injury in the second half in a time when substitutes were not permitted, ending the match with nine players. Such was the friendliness between the two sides in the early meetings that when Burton scored a bicycle kick in the match, several of his opponents stopped to shake hands with him in appreciation of the goal."]}]}}
