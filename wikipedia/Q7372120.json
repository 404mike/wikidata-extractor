He was a devout Anglican in the high church tradition and a local benefactor.  He paid for the restoration of his parish church and for the building of two new churches in villages on his estates.  He also built cottages and farm buildings in the villages.\nThrough his mother's line he inherited the Arley and Warburton estates in Cheshire.  He is best remembered for rebuilding Arley Hall and its chapel dedicated to St Mary, and for helping to create the picturesque appearance of the village of Great Budworth.  He and his wife designed extensive new formal gardens to the southeast of the hall, which included one of the earliest herbaceous borders in Britain. The hall and gardens are still owned by his family, but are open to the public.\nEgerton-Warburton's main hobby was hunting.  He was a keen member, and later the president, of the nearby Tarporley Hunt Club.  He also wrote poetry, the subject matter of which reflected his interests in hunting and in the countryside.

Local architect George Latham designed the house in a style which has become known as Jacobethan, copying elements of Elizabethan architecture. A Gothic Revival chapel designed by Anthony Salvin was subsequently built next to the hall. By the mid-20th century, parts of the house were in poor condition and were demolished, to be replaced by five private homes in a matching architectural style.", "Structural problems continued.  In 1813 the house and estate were inherited by Rowland Egerton-Warburton, who was only aged eight.  In 1818 plans were drawn up by Lewis Wyatt to rebuild the west front in Neoclassical style, but these were not implemented.  Egerton-Warburton came of age (21) in 1826 and decided to completely replace the house. His intention was that the house should reflect the antiquity of his inheritance, but that it should be constructed using techniques which were modern at the time.  He chose George Latham as his architect.  Latham, who was practising in Nantwich, was at that time in his twenties and was relatively unknown. He submitted four schemes for a symmetrical Gothic house, but these were not accepted. Then Latham prepared new plans which he called \"Queen Elizabethan\".  He suggested that this could be built for about \u00a35,000\u20136,000.  Every feature in the house had to have an exact model in an existing Elizabethan building. Egerton-Warburton and Latham visited 16th-century houses and studied illustrations to ensure that the features were dated correctly to Queen Elizabeth's reign.  The first phase of the building took place between 1832 and 1835 when the east, north and west wings of the old building were demolished. The house was equipped with modern plumbing and it was raised on arches above the damp Cheshire clays. The second phase of building work, carried out between 1840 and 1845, replaced the old south front. The final cost of the house was almost \u00a330,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ).", "The principal entrance was formerly through the porch on the south front, but its large doors caused too many draughts. In 1862 an entrance was created in the west front, leading to the West Hall, which contains panelling from the old house.  The West Hall in turn leads into the Library, which has one of Latham's most elaborate ceilings. The windows contain French stained glass, designed and made in Paris by M. Lusson.  The Library leads to the former Front Hall, which was transformed into the Dining Room when the original dining room was demolished in 1968.  In the Dining Room is a portrait of a noblemen, attributed to Cornelis Jonson.  The Gallery was the family's principal sitting-room during the 19th century. The overmantel of the fireplace contains sculptures depicting St George slaying the dragon and, on each side, personifications of Hope and Patience, with appropriate inscriptions.  The Drawing Room is in a different style from the other rooms on the ground floor, being plastered rather than panelled, and it contains much gilding.  The room is devoted to the memory of Rowland Egerton-Warburton and contains a number of family portraits.  Its coved ceiling, also designed by Latham, has a frieze depicting birds eating grapes.  The final room on the ground floor open to the public is the Small Dining Room.  It has a barrel-shaped ceiling, again designed by Latham.  In the room is a virginal dated 1675 by Stephen Keene, and is one of the oldest surviving English keyboard instruments. Its front is decorated with portraits of Charles II and Queen Catherine.  The Grand Staircase is considered to be Latham's finest work in the house. The staircase itself and the doorways are made of oak, and the decoration is in plasterwork and strapwork. Above the staircase is a glass-walled domed ceiling.", "Rowland Egerton-Warburton, influenced by the Oxford Movement, decided to add a Gothic chapel to the north-east of the house, and commissioned Anthony Salvin for the design. The chapel was consecrated in September 1845. In 1856\u201357 a north aisle and entrance porch designed by George Street were added.

Douglas's only church built entirely in half-timbering is the small church of St Michael and All Angels at Great Altcar in Lancashire. A church built in brick with half-timbering is St Chad's (1881) at Hopwas in Staffordshire. During this period Douglas built or restored a series of churches entirely in stone, incorporating mainly Gothic features together with vernacular elements.
