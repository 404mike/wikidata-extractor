In Giovanni's class, Cho had intimidated female classmates by photographing their legs under their desks and by writing violent and obscene poetry. In the fall of 2005, Giovanni told the then-department head Lucinda Roy she \"was willing to resign before [she] was going to continue with [Cho].\" After this, Roy removed Cho from the class.Fernandez, M. & Santora, M.

After Giovanni was informed of the massacre, she remarked that she \"knew when it happened that that's probably who it was,\" and \"would have been shocked if it wasn't.\" Roy had taught Cho in Introduction to Poetry the previous year. She described him as \"actually quite arrogant and could be quite obnoxious, and was also deeply, it seemed, insecure\"Acosta, J. (April 17, 2007).

She said that Cho resisted speaking in class and took cell phone pictures of her. After Roy became concerned with Cho's behavior and the themes in his writings, she started meeting with Cho to work with him one-on-one. However, she soon became concerned for her safety, and told her assistant that she would use the name of a dead professor as a duress code, in order to alert the assistant to call security. After Roy notified authorities of Cho's behavior, she urged Cho to seek counseling, but to her knowledge, Cho never followed through with the request. Roy described Cho as seeming \"extraordinarily lonely\" and said that Cho \"said to me once he was lonely and didn't have friends.\"", "According to the Virginia Tech report, Cho \"seemed to enjoy the idea of writing, especially poetry. His sister noticed that he would bring home stacks of books on literature and poetry and books on how to become a writer. Writing seemed to have become a passion, and his family was thrilled that he found something he could be truly excited about. He would spend hours at his computer writing, but when his sister asked to see his work, he would refuse. On one rare occasion, she did get to read a story he wrote about a boy and his imaginary friend, which she thought was somewhat strange, but nothing too odd.\"While in college, Cho wrote to Lucinda Roy, the chairwoman of the English department, to ask her for the names of a publisher or agent who could help get him published. He wrote her: \"My novel is relative[ly] short ... sort of like Tom Sawyer except that it's really silly and pathetic, depending on how you look at it.\" Cho submitted his idea to a publisher from New York, which rejected his book proposal in 2004. This refusal greatly reduced Cho's drive for writing."]}, {"page": "Lucinda roy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lucinda Roy "]}, {"page": "Timeline of the Virginia Tech shooting", "response": ["* Lucinda Roy, co-director of the creative writing program removed Cho from Professor Giovanni's class and tutored him one-on-one.
