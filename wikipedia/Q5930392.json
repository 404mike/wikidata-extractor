He went with only two men to a dug-out, when he left the men on top, entered it alone and brought out 14 prisoners. He then proceeded to clear other dug-outs, alone or with only one man, capturing machine-guns, killing some of the enemy and taking a large number of prisoners.After he retired from the Cheshire Regiment, he was appointed in 1938 as a recruitment officer in Dewsbury with the rank of major.His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Cheshire Regiment Museum, Chester, England.", "link_mentions": {}}}
