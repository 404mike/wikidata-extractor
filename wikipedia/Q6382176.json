He injured his back in his second appearance and was out of action for three months. When he did return, in his more usual position of central midfield, he \"[showed] all his customary composure and quality in possession\" in a friendly match, and went on to play in every competitive fixture until the final one of the regular season, for which, with a play-off place secure, Robinson selected a young team. He scored twice, the first a \"wonder goal\" from  against Leyton Orient in January 2011 that won the club's Goal of the Season award. In the first leg of the play-off semi-final, MK Dons took a 3\u20131 lead, but with ten minutes left, Gleeson was sent off for bringing down Mark Little and a penalty was awarded and converted. The sending-off was rescinded on appeal, but Peterborough United won the second leg 2\u20130, qualifying for the final 4\u20133 on aggregate, and Gleeson and teammate Keanu Marsh-Brown came to blows in frustration.

Hyde was named on Barnet's retained list in May 2013 with the club exercising a clause to extend his contract for another year. However, he was transfer listed at his own request the following month, with the club willing to listen to offers for him. League Two club York City expressed an interest in signing Hyde during the summer, but they were unable to meet Barnet's valuation of him after he scored four goals in the first five matches of 2013\u201314. He remained at the club after the transfer deadline, and despite missing much of the season through injury was Barnet's second highest scorer with 12 goals in 28 appearances, one behind Keanu Marsh-Brown with 13. He was offered a new one-year contract by Barnet, but was transfer listed again in April 2014 to attract interest in him, after expressing his desire to play in the Football League."]}, {"page": "List of Newport County A.F.C. players", "response": ["*  Keanu Marsh-Brown (1 caps)"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Milton Keynes Dons F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 January 2011 || FW ||  Keanu Marsh-Brown || Fulham || End of season || "]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["| Keanu Marsh-Brown"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Dundee United F.C. season", "response": ["| 26|||| MF|| Keanu Marsh-Brown", "| Keanu Marsh-Brown"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["| Keanu Marsh-Brown", "| Keanu Marsh-Brown"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"right\"|30||||MF||align=\"left\"|Keanu Marsh-Brown", "| = || MF ||  || Keanu Marsh-Brown || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "| Keanu Marsh-Brown"]}, {"page": "Kurtis Guthrie", "response": ["Guthrie scored 12 goals and provided seven assists in 46 appearances in his second season with the club as they reached the 2016 National League play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 15 May 2016.
