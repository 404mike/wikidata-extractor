The Dogs Do Bark", "response": ["The precise meaning of jags might also play a role in dating the rhyme's origins.  In the mid 1800s, English provincial dictionaries did not recognize it as a word for any type of garment.  But they did recognize the phrase rags and jags, which was understood to mean remnants or shreds of clothing. Also see   Note that the Holloway dictionary does recognize jag as a word, but not one that relates to clothing (see page 89).  On the other hand, one dictionary corroborates the general meaning of rags and jags, but also states that jags could be used by itself to signify a tattered garment.  See   And the Scottish dialect used the word to mean calf leather, but also to mean things made from that leather, including boots.  See page 342 of the Wright dictionary (middle of the second column), as well as   However, the word had a different clothing-related meaning in earlier centuries.  In the 1400s, the word was used to describe a fashion, first popular in Burgundy, of slitting or otherwise ornamenting the borders or hems of a garment.  Also see   The entry also notes that this meaning of jags was in use only until the late 1400s.  Over time, the word's meaning changed to describe the newer fashion of cutting slashes into the fabric of a garment to reveal the material being worn underneath.  And see page 29 of , where the authors use the word jags to describe what would now be called buttonholes.  With this latter meaning, jags entered the vocabulary of Tudor-era writers.  In one of his contributions to the Holinshed's Chronicles (1577), William Harrison used the word to describe current fashions in England\u2014\"What should I say of their doublets ... full of jags and cuts\".  The quoted phrase appears in the second column of page 172, at lines 18\u201320.  Harrison uses the word again at line 58.  The Harrison material was re-printed in a more legible, but slightly abridged, form in   The relevant passages are on page 105 of the text.  Although published anonymously, the HathiTrust believes the author to be Mary Margaret Stanley Egerton, Countess of Wilton and wife of Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton.  The word was used in the 1594 version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, where one character says to a tailor \"What, with cuts and jags? ... Thou hast spoil'd the gowne.\"Act III, Scene V, line 18, as seen in   Note that Boas does not believe that Shakespeare actually wrote the line.  See his discussion of authorship at pages xxxii\u2013xxxvii of the book's Introduction.  And in the early 1700s, the anonymous translator of a 1607 book by an Italian writer also used jags in a specific clothing-related sense, linking it to garments made of velvet.  Note that jags is the English word chosen by the translator (possibly Nicholson).  In the original 1607 publication, Pancirollus wrote in Latin and used the word lacerari (see page 729 of the original 1607 publication)."]}]}}
