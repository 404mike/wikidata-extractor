Even King Edward VII was concerned that there had been a lot of gossip about Lady Julia and Lloyd George and this may have delayed her husband's getting his knighthood.Cameron Hazlehurst and Christine Woodland (eds.), A Liberal Chronicle: Journals and Papers of J A Pease, 1908\u20131910; Historians Press, 1994 p102 Frances Stevenson certainly believed that Lloyd George had not only been close to Lady Henry but that Lady Henry herself was clearly in love with him, describing her as 'quite mad' about him. After Frances Stevenson started working for Lloyd George in 1911 and he began to become attracted to her, Lloyd George determined to stop any dalliance with Julia Henry. She was distressed by what she saw as a public snub and fled back to America, writing to her husband that she never wanted to be alone with Lloyd George again. It seems unlikely that Henry himself was aware of anything going on from Lloyd George's side. If anything he seems to have thought it was all in his wife's mind and believed she was exaggerating their relationship. It is also clear that Lady Henry's hurt feelings had a lot to do with the damage Lloyd George's rejection could do to her reputation as a political hostess.Ffion Hague, The Pain and the Privilege: The Women in Lloyd George\u2019s Life; 1919; Harper Press, 2008 p230-231", "Some reconciliation was affected in 1915 when Lloyd George visited the Henrys to show sympathy on the loss of their son in battle even though he was reluctant to do so because of the awkwardness arising from his previous relationship with Lady Henry and the strength of Julia Henry's feelings for him.
