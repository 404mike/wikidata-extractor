He was a partner in Bristol businesses and owned ships linked directly to the slave economy.The extent of his slave ownership was such that when slavery was abolished in 1834 the British Government awarded him one of the largest compensation awards in the UK for his ownership of 4,967 enslaved people.For decades he was a key member of organisations in Bristol such as the Society of Merchant Venturers and the West India Association which lobbied against the abolition of slavery.He was a leading Tory in Bristol and a member of the Council continuously for more than 56 years.Despite his influence on Bristol when alive, very few people today have heard of Daniel because, unlike other slave owners connected to the City such as Edward Colston, Daniel was not a philanthropist. Although he was worth the equivalent of \u00a319m when he died \u2013 his fortune made from enslaved labour \u2013 he did not give a penny to the City where he had lived for 90 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clifton Suspension Bridge", "response": ["The Bridge Committee which had been set up to look at the designs sponsored the Clifton Bridge Bill which became an Act when the Bill received the Royal Assent on the 29th May, 1830.
