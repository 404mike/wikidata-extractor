Arriving part way through the 2004\u201305 season, Jones quickly established himself as City's first choice keeper, making 23 appearances. In January 2005 he played in Exeter's memorable 0\u20130 draw at Old Trafford in the FA Cup. On 1 July 2005, Inglethorpe acquired Jones from Orient, and signed him to a permanent deal. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Inglethorpe left Exeter and was replaced by new manager Paul Tisdale. During the pre-season, Jones was forced to compete for his spot with then backup keeper, and former Exeter youth trainee Martin Rice. Days prior to Exeter's first match of the season, Tisdale selected Rice as his first choice keeper. Jones then became Exeter's second choice keeper. He returned to the first-team for the 2007 Conference playoff final, in which he saved a penalty \u2013 becoming the first person to do so at the new Wembley Stadium. Exeter failed to win the final though and during the next season, Jones figured mostly as an understudy to Rice's replacement Andy Marriott. He was chosen in the first team again for the play-offs and this time, Exeter managed to win the final at Wembley, with Jones keeping a clean sheet. In the 2008\u201309 season he played in all 46 League Two matches for Exeter City. Also he won the 2008\u201309 player of the season award for Exeter City after many stunning performances in goal throughout the season."]}, {"page": "Martin Ling", "response": ["He was appointed Torquay United manager on 13 June 2011 after the departure of Paul Buckle to Bristol Rovers.
