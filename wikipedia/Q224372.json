P. Wigner (1961), \"Remarks on the mind-body question\", in: I. J. Good, \"The Scientist Speculates\", London, Heinemann and developed into a thought experiment by David Deutsch in 1985. The scenario involves an indirect observation of a quantum measurement: An observer W observes another observer F who performs a quantum measurement on a physical system. The two observers then formulate a statement about the physical system's state after the measurement according to the laws of quantum theory. However, in most of the interpretations of quantum theory, the resulting statements of the two observers contradict each other. This reflects a seeming incompatibility of two laws in quantum theory: the deterministic and continuous time evolution of the state of a closed system and the nondeterministic, discontinuous collapse of the state of a system upon measurement. Wigner's friend is therefore directly linked to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics with its famous Schr\u00f6dinger's cat paradox.", "The above and other of Wigner's original remarks about his friend appeared in his article \"Remarks on the Mind-Body Question\", published in the book The Scientist Speculates (1961), edited by I.
