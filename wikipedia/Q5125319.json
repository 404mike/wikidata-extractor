It was moved to Sunday afternoons when Matthew Bannister became controller in October 1993, and then to Sunday evenings in May 1994.  For its last year, 1995\u20136, it was broadcast from Glasgow and presented by John Cavanagh.  The format of the programme fundamentally changed when Sturgess took over, firmly setting out its stall in the 'contemporary thrash' genre."]}, {"page": "Absolute Radio 80s", "response": ["The station's DJs include Leona Graham, Sarah Champion and Richie Firth.
