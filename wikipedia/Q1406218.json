He was arrested during the events of Bloody Sunday and charged with throwing stones, but the charges were later dropped.  McAteer always strongly denied these claims.McAteer himself became prominent in the Nationalist Party.  In 1973, he was elected to Derry City Council, and he was re-elected in 1977. In October 1977 he merged the Nationalist Party with Unity to form the Irish Independence Party (IIP), becoming joint chair with former Unity leader Frank McManus.  He stood for the party in Derry at the 1979 general election, but could take only fourth place in the poll.  He held his seat on the City Council in 1981, with an increased vote. McAteer narrowly held the seat in 1985 and the IIP overall saw their representation on local councils reduced from 21 members in 1981 to 4 members in 1985 and dissolved before the next local election, and McAteer did not restand in 1989.McAteer started an accountancy firm in 1973, and continues to run the firm.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Eddie McAteer, one-time leader of the Nationalist Party, was the brother of Hugh McAteer, a Sinn F\u00e9in and IRA activist, and the father of Fergus McAteer, a leader of the Irish Independence Party"]}, {"page": "Nationalist Party (Ireland)", "response": ["*Fergus McAteer 1973\u20131977"]}, {"page": "Derry/Londonderry name dispute", "response": ["The Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 and the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 abolished the councils of the counties and county boroughs, and the lower-level county [urban and rural] districts.Weatherup 2007, \u00a7 11 These were replaced by 26 new districts based around towns and cities. The geographical areas of the county and city no longer correspond to local government areas, but retain a legal existence as lieutenancy areas for ceremonial purposes. One of the 26 new districts comprised the areas previously in the county borough of Londonderry and the adjacent county district of the same name. This new district was initially also named Londonderry, and, being based on a city, its council was named \"Londonderry City Council\".Weatherup 2007, \u00a7 14 Nationalists accounted for the majority of the population, and nationalist political parties were elected to a majority of the council seats. In 1974 Fergus McAteer of the Nationalist Party first raised the question of the name at the city council. In 1978, now in the Irish Independence Party (IIP), McAteer tabled a motion \"that this council wishes that the official name of the city be restored to the original and more common name of Derry\". It was passed with Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) support, on the understanding that no immediate action would be taken. When McAteer raised the issue for a fourth time in 1983, the council passed a resolution to officially change the name of the district from \"Londonderry\" to \"Derry\", consequently changing the name of the council from \"Londonderry City Council\" to \"Derry City Council\". Andy Pollak said that the vote symbolised the SDLP's shift from co-operation with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in the 1970s to confrontation after the 1981 republican hunger strike, and that the SDLP was worried about Sinn F\u00e9in taking seats in the 1985 local elections. Pursuant to its resolution, the council applied under section 51 of the 1972 act to the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment, which was under direct rule from the Northern Ireland Office in London, with Chris Patten as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in charge of the department. On 24 January 1984, Patten decided to accede to the name change, which was effected by a statutory order commencing on 7 May 1984.Weatherup 2007, \u00a7 16; Centre for European Policy Studies, accessed 6 October 2007  "]}, {"page": "Irish Independence Party", "response": ["The Irish Independence Party (IIP) was a nationalist political party in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 p. 135. by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969).
