After following his uncle into the service of the British East India Company, he became wealthy and returned to England, although he was frustrated in an attempt to obtain a directorship of the company. His wealth and his friendship with Lord Caledon enabled him to sit in Parliament for various boroughs until 1818, although he was not a particularly conspicuous member. He died at his country home in Devonshire in 1820.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Josias Du Pr\u00e9 Porcher"]}, {"page": "Dundalk (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Josias Du Pr\u00e9 Porcher"]}, {"page": "Du Pre Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon", "response": ["Other political correspondence in the Caledon Papers, in this case during the governorship years, relates to Lord Caledon's relations with the government at home and, in particular, to the parliamentary conduct of the two members, Josias Du Pr\u00e9 Porcher and Nicholas Vansittart, whom he returned for the notoriously rotten borough of Old Sarum, Wiltshire. He had bought this borough and estate in 1802, for c.\u00a343,000, with a view to increasing his claims to some form of suitable official employment. Though he consistently denied that his appointment to the Cape had been a 'political' one, it was undeniable that the seats for Old Sarum had been an added recommendation. Doubt therefore arose as to whether he owed a political loyalty to the home government for the time being, or to the Grenville administration which had appointed him and which had fallen from power soon afterwards, in March 1807. There is correspondence on this subject with Lord Grenville himself, Porcher and Vansittart; also with Lord Castlereagh, who held office in the government which succeeded Grenville's. The Caledon Cape Papers illuminate this shadowy area between political and public service."]}, {"page": "Porcher", "response": ["* Josias Du Pr\u00e9 Porcher (c. 1761 \u2013 1820), English politician"]}, {"page": "Sir William Burnaby, 1st Baronet", "response": ["He died in 1776, and was succeeded by his son Sir William Chaloner Burnaby.
