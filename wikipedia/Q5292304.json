Darwin wanted to give a fresh look to the team, and so held a contest to rename the team.

In 1970 the team also hired trainer Don Brankley, who stayed with the team until retiring at the end of the 2007\u201308 season. The team grew from a chronic also-ran in the late 1960s and early 1970s to a contender near the end of the decade. The highlight of the Darwin era came in 1976\u201377, when a powerful Knights team led by future NHLers Rob Ramage, Brad Marsh and Dino Ciccarelli defeated the St. Catharines Fincups in the conference final on an overtime goal by Dan Eastman to advance to the OHL final against the 67's. However, the 67's were triumphant in six games in the league final.
