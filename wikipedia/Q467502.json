As Seen on TV featured the Acorn Antiques series of sketches, parodying the low-budget soap opera Crossroads, and rumoured to be named after an antiques shop in her birthplace. Acorn Antiques is remembered for characters such as \"Mrs Overall\" (played by Walters), the deliberately bad camera angles and wobbling sets, and Celia Imrie's sarcastic tone as \"Miss Babs\". One of Wood's most popular comic songs, The Ballad of Barry and Freda (Let's Do It), originated on this show.
