His thought is characterised by a strong accent on diversity, pluralism and dissenting perspectives. Science journalist Ehsan Masood suggests that Sardar 'deliberately cultivates a carefully calculated ambiguity projecting several things at once, yet none of them on their own'.Ehsan Masood, 'Introduction: the Ambiguous Intellectual\u2019, in Ehsan Masood, editor, How Do You Know: Reading Ziauddin Sardar on Islam, Science and Cultural Relations Pluto Press, London, 2006, p1 Futurist Tony Stevenson points out that his 'intellectual aggression' hides a 'sincere and deep humanity': 'while his cultural analysis is surgically incisive, it is largely free of the theoretical correctness of academic thought', while he 'draws on a depth of academic thought', he 'always remains accessible'.Tony Stevenson, \u2018Ziauddin Sardar: Explaining Islam to the West\u2019 in Profiles in Courage: Political Actors and Ideas in Contemporary Asia, editors, Gloria Davies, JV D\u2019Cruz and Nathan Hollier, Australian Scholarly Publishing, Melbourne, 2008, page 80.", "The fundamental principle of Sardar's thought is that 'there is more than one way to be human'. 'I do not regard \"the human\" either as \"the\" or as a priori given', he has said. 'The western way of being human is one amongst many. Similarly, the Islamic way of being human is also one amongst many. The Australian aboriginal way of being human is also another way of being human. I see each culture as a complete universe with its own way of knowing, being and doing \u2013 and hence, its own way of being human'.Ziauddin Sardar interviewed by Tony Fry, \u2018On Erasure, Appropriation, Transmodernity, What\u2019s Wrong with Human Rights and What\u2019s Lies Beyond Difference\u2019, Design Philosophy Papers Collection Four, edited by Anne-Marie Wallis, Team D/E/S Publications, Ravensbourne, Australia, 2008, 83\u201391. The corollary is that there are also different ways of knowing. The question that Sardar has always asked is: 'how do you know? The answer depends a great deal on who 'you' are: 'how you look at the world, how you shape your inquiry, the period and culture that shapes your outlook and the values that frame how you think'.Ehsan Masood, \u2018Introduction: the Ambiguous Intellectual\u2019, in Ehsan Masood, editor, How Do You Know: Reading Ziauddin Sardar on Islam, Science and Cultural Relations, Pluto Press, London, 2006.", "Sardar's alternative to postmodernism is what he calls \"transmodernity\". He describes this as: \"the transfer of modernity and postmodernism from the edge of chaos to a new order of society\". Transmodernity for Sardar is about finding a synthesis between \"life enhancing tradition\" \u2013 tradition that is amenable to change and transition \u2013 and a new form of modernity that respects the values and lifestyles of traditional cultures.Ziauddin Sardar, \u2018Beyond Difference: Cultural Relations in a New Century\u2019, in How Do You Know: Reading Ziauddin Sardar on Islam, Science and Cultural Relations edited by Ehsan Masood, Pluto Press, London, 2006.", "*How Do You Know?
