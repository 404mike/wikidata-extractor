The first of these wins, a 4\u20131 success, was watched by 41,534\u00a0spectators, the biggest home crowd of the season until then. The victory was followed by a 3\u20131 away win a week later. On 5\u00a0February 1921, Anderson scored five goals in a \"brilliant\" performance against Aston Villa as Burnley recorded their second 7\u20131 win of the season.

In the Third Round, Burnley were handed an away tie at Hull City, who at the time were struggling in the Football League Second Division and had won only two matches in the previous five months.
