Rising from shoemaker to shipping magnate in little more than thirty years, Allan retired in 1839 having made a fortune and created a transatlantic dynasty. He is recognised as one of the major contributors to Scotland's commercial interests in the early 19th century, and to the establishment of the Firth of Clyde as an international centre of shipping. During the Napoleonic Wars his brig Jean \u2013 so named for his wife \u2013 held the record for the fastest crossing between the Firth of Clyde and Quebec City. Under his five sons, the Allan Line became the world's largest privately owned shipping empire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1854", "response": ["* March 18 \u2013 Alexander Allan, Scottish businessman, founder of Allan Line (b. 1780)"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Necropolis", "response": ["*Alexander Allan, ship owner"]}, {"page": "Agnes Broun", "response": ["Agnes's half-sister was Jean Brown (1750\u20131821) who, in 1775, married James Allan and lived at Old Rome Ford near Gatehead, in East Ayrshire.
