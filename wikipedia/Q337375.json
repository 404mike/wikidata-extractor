His first government post was as Minister for Europe from 1979 to 1983 (being that office's inaugural holder) and he served in several Cabinet roles from 1984 onwards, including Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1984\u201385), Home Secretary (1985\u201389) and Foreign Secretary (1989\u201395).  He stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party leadership in 1990, and retired from frontline politics during a Cabinet reshuffle in 1995.In 1997, Hurd was elevated to the House of Lords and is one of the Conservative Party's most senior elder statesmen.

Disraeli had, for example, stressed the need to improve the lot of the urban labourer. The memory of Disraeli was used by the Conservatives to appeal to the working classes, with whom he was said to have had a rapport.Blake (1967), pp. 523\u2013524 This aspect of his policies has been re-evaluated by historians in the 20th and 21st centuries.

With the 'Lawson Boom' showing signs of running out of steam, exacerbated by rising oil prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, there were fears of a potential recession and pressure to cut interest rates. Thatcher finally agreed on 4 October, and Britain's entry into the ERM at a rate of DM 2.95 to \u00a31.00 (with an agreed 6% floating 'band' either side) was announced the following day.

Both John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd supported Thatcher in the first round. Major was at home in Huntingdon recovering from a pre-arranged wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot, which Thatcher won but not by the required threshold, necessitating a second round. Following discussions with her cabinet, in which many stated that though supporting her they doubted she could win, Thatcher withdrew from the contest and announced that she would resign as prime minister once a new leader had been elected. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot, with Thatcher's backing. Major's platform was one of moderation on Europe, a review of the Poll Tax and the desire to build a 'classless society'."]}, {"page": "March 8", "response": ["*  1930   \u2013 Douglas Hurd, English politician"]}, {"page": "1993", "response": ["** Douglas Hurd is the first high-ranking British official to visit Argentina since the Falklands War."]}, {"page": "1930", "response": ["* March 8 \u2013 Douglas Hurd, English politician "]}, {"page": "Foreign Secretary", "response": ["| rowspan=3 | Douglas Hurd"]}, {"page": "Hillsborough disaster", "response": ["Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Home Secretary Douglas Hurd visited Hillsborough the day after the disaster and met survivors.

Over the weekend on 24\u201325 November, many Conservative MPs were faced with the anger of their local party members who overwhelmingly supported Thatcher but did not at that time have a vote in leadership elections, and opinion polls showed that chancellor John Major would also boost Conservative support if leader (previously Heseltine's unique selling-point). Heseltine had never done much to court support among younger MPs the way Major had, and was seen as aloof even by his own supporters. In the second ballot, a week after the first, Heseltine's vote actually fell to 131 (just over 35%) as some MPs had voted for him in the first ballot as a protest against or to try to oust Thatcher but preferred to vote for other candidates now that they had a wider choice.

Home was firm in his support of the invasion, but used his contacts with Jawaharlal Nehru, V. K. Krishna Menon, Nan Pandit and others to try to prevent the Commonwealth from breaking up. His relationship with Eden was supportive and relaxed; he felt able, as others did not, to warn Eden of unease about Suez both internationally and among some members of the cabinet. Eden dismissed the latter as the \"weak sisters\"; the most prominent was Rab Butler, whose perceived hesitancy over Suez on top of his support for appeasement of Hitler damaged his standing within the Conservative party.

On 8 October 1990, Thatcher entered the pound into the ERM at DM 2.95 to the Pound. Hence, if the exchange rate ever neared the bottom of its permitted range, DM 2.773 (\u20ac1.4178 at the DM/Euro conversion rate), the government would be obliged to intervene. In 1989, the UK had inflation three times the rate of Germany, higher interest rates at 15%, and much lower labour productivity than France and Germany, which indicated the UK's different economic state in comparison to other ERM countries.1990\u20131992: Britain and the politics of the European exchange rate mechanism.

In meeting the third of these, Lamont had to overcome the resistance of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, who told Lamont: \"I can't see what you are so worked up about.
