He was a founder of drum and bass label Full Cycle Recordings and a member of Roni Size & Reprazent (1997 Mercury Prize winners) and Breakbeat Era.\nKausman spent his formative years in Barnstaple before moving to Bristol in 1985 as a teenager. An early interest in house and hardcore led to a musical partnership with friend Jody Wisternoff (who later formed Way Out West with Nick Warren). Die DJ'd for a brief period with Circus Warp - a free party sound system. Recording together under the aliases of Tru Funk and Sub Love on Three Stripe Records, they created hardcore staples like \"4am\" and made numerous DJing appearances at early Universe raves. The partnership, however, was a brief one.\nAfter a chance meeting with Roni Size at Bristol's Replay Records store in 1992, this led to their first collaboration in the form of Agility for V Recordings and Die's ongoing contributions to the Full Cycle Recordings catalogue.\nTogether with Size, he originated the seminal \"Music Box\" which was to become the title track of the debut Full Cycle compilation in 1996. Emerging firstly as a core member of Reprazent and later in 1998 as one third of Breakbeat Era (a project spawned by the \"Music Box\" track of the same name), he soon found himself remixing for DJs including DJ Shadow, Towa Tei and DJ Cam. His remix of the Reprazent single \"Watching Windows\" was released in its own right by Talkin' Loud. He has his own label called Clear Skyz.DJ Die has also recorded under the aliases Break & Die (DJ Die and DJ Break), Die & Clipz (DJ Die and DJ Clipz), Swabe, 4 Tree, Breakbeat Era (with Leonie Laws and Roni Size), DNA (with Bill Riley), Scorpio (with Roni), Wings (with Roni and Krust), Kamanchi (with Krust) and DieMantle (with Dismantle).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Die", "response": ["* DJ Die, British DJ and musician with Reprazent"]}, {"page": "Jungle music", "response": ["Notable releases include: \"Burial\" by Leviticus, \"Dangerous\" by DJ Ron, \"Lover to Lover / Maximum Style\" by Tom & Jerry, \"Original Nuttah\" by Shy FX, \"All the Crew Big Up\" by Roni Size & DJ Die, \"Incredible / Sweet Love\" by M-Beat, \"The Helicopter Tune\" by Deep Blue, \"Super Sharp Shooter\" by DJ Zinc, \"Sovereign Melody / Lion Heart\" by Dillinja, \"Everyman\" by Kenny Ken, \"The Victory / Lovable\" by DJ Dextrous, \"Bad Ass\" by Aphrodite, \"The Lighter\" by DJ SS, and \"Tiger Style\" by DJ Hype."]}, {"page": "A Certain Ratio", "response": ["| Soundstation Volume 2 EP ||  \"Samba 123\" (Fila Brazilia remix)\"Yeah Boy\" (Sons of Samarkand remix)\"Yeah Boy\" (DJ Die) ||  12\"/CD ||  1997 ||  Rob's \u2013 12ROB52/CDROB52 ||  ||  ||  || "]}, {"page": "Krust", "response": ["In 1992 Fresh 4 disbanded as a group and returned to Bristol. Krust continued to work on music while attending raves in the UK south west region. He released two studio productions during this time with Flynn and Suv under the name Hocus Pocus. These early hardcore tracks were released on Twisted Records, a label financed by Smith & Mighty During this time Krust also ran a citywide bicycle courier company called Catch 22 and, alongside Suv and DJ Die, would also host events in the Bedminster area of Bristol in the same squat that the video for Fresh 4's \"Wishing on a Star\" was filmed in. These squat raves would often hire the Diditek soundsystem run by Carl Williams whose brother, Roni Size, was the engineer", "Talkin' Loud was also responsible for many Krust productions during this time including \"True Stories\", \"Future Unknown\" and his debut solo album Coded Language in 1999. Rapper and slam poet Saul Williams featured on the title track and the album also included beatless string pieces such as \"One Moment\" and the vocals of singer Morgan on the track \"Re Arrange\". It was met with favourable reviews. Coded Language was followed by a remix album Decoded in 2000 which featured remixes by Krust himself, DJ Die and previously unreleased track \"Witchcraft\". Krust also appeared on Talkin' Loud's soundtrack to UK horror movie Long Time Dead with a cover of David Bowie and Giorgio Moroder's \"Cat People\"", "In contrast to the \"Kloakin\" series, Thompson and DJ Die continued to work together on their funkier, more soulful Kamanchi project. Following the release of \"Stay\" in 1999 on V Recordings' Planet V and numerous dubplates such as \"Warrior Ship\" and \"Right Now Doing Our Thing\", Kamanchi released their only album I Kamanchi in 2003. The album featured live instrumentation and had a heavy vocal presence from singers Tali, Leanne and Keirin Kirby (under the name Violet) and rappers Rodney P, Darrison and Retna. It was described by Dutch dance website Party Scene as one \"that underlines that the future of drum 'n' bass lies in the vocals and warmth and not so much in sinister baldness\" while US site XLR8R wrote how the album \"valiantly finds a balance between the crossover cut and the dancefloor filler.\""]}, {"page": "List of jungle and drum and bass artists", "response": ["* DJ Die"]}, {"page": "4 Tree", "response": ["#REDIRECT DJ Die"]}, {"page": "Roni Size & Reprazent", "response": ["*DJ Die (Daniel Kausman) \u2013 programming/production"]}, {"page": "Breakbeat Era", "response": ["Breakbeat Era was a British music group from Bristol.
