Anderson is a Professor Emeritus at the University of Melbourne. She was the Herald Chair of Fine Arts at the University of Melbourne from 1997 until 2014, and was President of International Committee of the History of Art (Comit\u00e9 International d'Histoire de l'Art, CIHA) from 2008 to 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Claudio Achillini", "response": ["On February 9, 1621, Achillini went to Rome, where he obtained great promises of preferment from popes and cardinals, but they proved only promises. Odoardo Farnese, duke of Parma, engaged him however on very liberal terms, to occupy the chair of law in his university. He wrote the text for a play with music by Monteverdi presented during wedding celebrations at the Farnese court in Parma in 1628. As Jaynie Anderson has suggested, Achillini may have devised the program for Agostino Carracci's frescoes in the Palazzo del Giardino."]}, {"page": "Death of Cleopatra", "response": ["There are no surviving records indicating an exact date of Cleopatra's death. Theodore Cressy Skeat deduced that she died on 12\u00a0August, 30 BC, on the basis of contemporary records of fixed events along with cross examination of historical sources. His supposition is supported by Stanley M. Burstein, James Grout, and Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton, although the latter are more cautious by qualifying it was circa 12 August. An alternative date of 10\u00a0August, 30 BC, is supported by scholars such as Duane W. Roller, Joann Fletcher, and Jaynie Anderson."]}, {"page": "Portrait of a Woman as Judith", "response": ["The work was lost until re-appearing on the art market in 1985 thanks to a re-reading of its iconography by Australian art historian Jaynie Anderson identifying its subject as Olimpia Luna (died 1592) as the biblical figure Judith, with Holofernes' head modelled on her husband Melchiorre Zoppio (1544 \u2013 1634), co-founder of the Accademia dei Gelati in Bologna, an association of writers, poets and scholars of which Agostino was probably a member. ", "Elsewhere in Felsina Pittrice Malvasia states that Agostino \"made [for Zoppio] the portrait of his wife, already dead and buried, from [Zoppio's] memory, with a small portrait of himself in her hand\", which Anderson identifies with the head of Holofernes. She also argues that the subject's rich golden dress, studded with jewels and pearls to shine like the moon, was a play on Olimpia's maiden name Luna (the Italian word for moon).Jaynie Anderson, The Head-Hunter and Head-Huntress in Italian Religious Portraiture, in Vernacular Christianity: Essays in the Social Anthropology of Religion, New York, 1988, pp. 66-68. In 1603 Zoppio wrote a short book, only published later under the title Consolation of Melchiorre Zoppio, moral philosophy on the death of his wife Olimpia Luna Zoppio (Consolatione di Melchiorre Zoppio, filosofo morale nella morte della moglie Olimpia Luna Z [oppio]). In it he described how he had a vision of a woman during a night of torment and how that vision revealed herself to be his late wife. The description of the vision's dress matches details in the painting, particularly its \"turquoise dress, studded with pearls divided into flames representing shooting stars\", adding that \"all told, there was nothing in her that did not signify heaven to me\". Though this does not match the colour of the dress in the portrait, it does match its pearl motifs of shooting stars, perhaps meaning the book was inspired by the painting not vice versa."]}]}}
