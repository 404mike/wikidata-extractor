From an early age she was encouraged to observe and develop a keen interest in British wildlife due to the influence of her late father, Chris Mead, who was a well-known author and broadcaster. She uses personal experiences and direct observation to provide inspiration for her work. The countryside and wildlife around her home in Hilborough in rural Norfolk and her travels in Asia and Africa, provide subject matter for her work. She received formal art education during a foundation year at St Albans College, followed by a degree in Fine Art at the Norwich School of Art.After showing at its annual show for several years, Mead was elected a full member of the Society of Wildlife Artists, SWLA. In 2004, she was elected to Council of the SWLA and won the Society's Capmark Award in 2007 and was runner-up in 2006. In 2009, she was elected as the Society's President, making her the youngest and first woman to hold the post in the Society's 47-year history.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Society of Wildlife Artists", "response": ["The Society of Wildlife Artists is a British organisation for artists who paint or draw wildlife.
