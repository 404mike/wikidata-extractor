Her personal best for the event is 52.40 seconds. She is a frequent member of the British 4\u00d7400 m relay team and won a bronze medal at the European Athletics Championships in 2010. She was a silver medallist in the relay for England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games.\nShe was selected to represent Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 4\u00d7400m women's relay At the 2009 European Athletics Indoor Championships she won a relay silver medal in a team with Donna Fraser, Kim Wall and Marilyn Okoro, finishing as runners-up behind Russia. Going into the outdoor season, she was chosen for the relay at the 2009 European Team Championships and helped Great Britain to the bronze medal. She once again represented Great Britain at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in the relay. A team of Lee McConnell, Christine Ohuruogu, Barr and Nicola Sanders came fourth in the final.The following indoor season, Barr ran in the relay at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships and Britain again finished fourth, just beaten to the bronze by the Czech Republic. She won a bronze medal representing Great Britain at the 2010 European Championships in the 4\u00d7400m relay. The team completed the final in a time of 3:24.32 minutes. That year she received her first call as an individual athlete, representing England at the Commonwealth Games in the 400 m. She reached the semi-finals of the 400 m then went on to win a silver medal with the English women's relay team. Despite this, Barr lost her UK Athletics Podium Scheme funding that year. However, in August 2011 she agreed a sponsorship deal with Worldpay. During the 2011 season she suffered a rib injury which caused difficulties with breathing, and as a result she did not finish the 400m at the UK trials in 2011, having to abandon the race with 100m to go. Barr was subsequently not selected for the British squad for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics in Daegu.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2009 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|valign=top| Lee McConnellChristine OhuruoguVicki BarrNicola SandersJenny Meadows*|| 3:25.16\u0422\u0420\u0418 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0419\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0425 \u041b\u0415\u0413\u041a\u041e\u0410\u0422\u041b\u0415\u0422\u0410 \u0414\u0418\u0421\u041a\u0412\u0410\u041b\u0418\u0424\u0418\u0426\u0418\u0420\u041e\u0412\u0410\u041d\u042b \u0417\u0410 \u0414\u041e\u041f\u0418\u041d\u0413 (Three Russian athletes are disqualified for doping) Sport Express, 21 June 2017 Ennis-Hill and US Women's 4x400m team to receive reallocated gold medals in London IAAF, 26 July 2017"]}, {"page": "2009 European Athletics Indoor Championships", "response": ["|Donna FraserKim WallVicki BarrMarilyn Okoro||3:30.42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   "]}, {"page": "2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships", "response": ["|valign=top|Kim WallVicki BarrPerri Shakes-DraytonLee McConnell  || 3:30.29 SB"]}, {"page": "Vicky", "response": ["* Victoria Vicki Barr (athlete) (born 1982), British sprinter"]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["4 \u00d7 400 m Relay: Nicola Sanders, Christine Ohuruogu, Lee McConnell, Vicki Barr, Jenny Meadows, Donna Fraser", "4 \u00d7 400 m Relay: Nicola Sanders, Christine Ohuruogu, Lee McConnell, Vicki Barr, Jenny Meadows, Donna Fraser"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Vicki Barr*Donna Fraser*Lee McConnell*Christine OhuruoguMarilyn OkoroNicola SandersKelly Sotherton"]}, {"page": "Vicki Barr", "response": ["Vicki Barr may refer to:", "* Vicki Barr (athlete) (born 1982), British sprinter", "* The lead character in the Vicki Barr (books) series"]}, {"page": "Marilyn Okoro", "response": ["Marilyn had a limited race schedule in 2010, but returned to a degree of form when taking bronze at the UK championships.
