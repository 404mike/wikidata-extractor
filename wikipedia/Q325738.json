Sherborne was the new see, of which Aldhelm became the first bishop around 705.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 222 He wished to resign the abbey of Malmesbury which he had governed for thirty years, but yielding to the remonstrances of the monks he continued to direct it until his death. He was now an old man, but he showed great activity in his new functions. The cathedral church which he built at Sherborne, though replaced later by a Norman church, is described by William of Malmesbury. In his capacity as bishop, he displayed a great deal of energy. This included going into public places where he would sing hymns and passages from the gospels interspersed with bits of clowning to draw attention to his message."]}, {"page": "Ine of Wessex", "response": ["The prologue to Ine's laws lists his advisors.  Three people are named: bishops Eorcenwald and H\u00e6dde, and Ine's father, King Cenred.  Ine was a Christian king, whose intent to encourage Christianity is clear from the laws. The oath of a communicant, for example, is declared to carry more weight than that of a non-Christian; and baptism and religious observance are also addressed. Significant attention is also paid to civil issues\u2014more than in the contemporary Kentish laws.Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p. 124.", "Ine was a Christian king, who ruled as a patron and protector of the church.  The introduction to his laws names his advisors, among whom are Eorcenwald, Bishop of London and H\u00e6dde, Bishop of Winchester; Ine says that the laws were also made with the advice and instruction of \"all my ealdormen, and chief councillors of my people, and also a great assembly of the servants of God\".Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p. 2.  The laws themselves demonstrate Ine's Christian convictions, specifying fines for failing to baptize infants or to tithe. Ine supported the church by patronising religious houses, especially in the new diocese of Sherborne, which had been divided from the diocese of Winchester in 705. Ine had opposed this division, ignoring threats of excommunication from Canterbury, but he agreed to it when Bishop Haedde died."]}, {"page": "Lichfield", "response": ["The first cathedral was built on the present site in 700 when Bishop H\u00e6dde built a new church to house the bones of St Chad, which had become the centre of a sacred shrine to many pilgrims when he died in 672. The burial in the cathedral of the kings of Mercia, Wulfhere in 674 and Ceolred in 716, further increased the city's prestige.From: 'Lichfield: History to c.1500', A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 14: Lichfield (1990), pp. 4\u201314.

In 786 King Offa made the city an archbishopric with authority over all the bishops from the Humber to the River Thames; his appointee was Archbishop Hygeberht. After King Offa's death in 796, Lichfield's power waned; in 803 the primacy was restored to Canterbury by Pope Leo III after only 16 years."]}, {"page": "Headingley", "response": ["Headingley was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as Hedingelei or Hedingeleia when it was recorded that Ilbert de Lacy held 7 carucates (about 840 acres) of land. The name is thought to derive from Old English Head(d)inga 'of the descendants of Head(d)a' + l\u0113ah 'open ground', thus meaning \"the clearing of Hedda's people\".A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Name Society, 30\u201337, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961\u201363), IV 140. Headda has sometimes been identified with Saint H\u00e6dde. A stone coffin found near Beckett Park in 1995 suggests there may have been an earlier settlement in late Roman or post-Roman times."]}]}}
