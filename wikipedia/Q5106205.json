He went there because they had a television studio available for the students. He used the material he created there to apply for jobs and he got a job as a researcher at Granada Television. He then started directing. In 1982 he went freelance and in that decade he directed episodes of the television soap operas Brookside and EastEnders.\nWhile working on EastEnders, Clough got to know one of the assistant directors, Gary Downie, who had also worked on Doctor Who. He got an interview with Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner and he later directed six serials of the series \u2014 Terror of the Vervoids, The Ultimate Foe, Delta and the Bannermen, Dragonfire, The Happiness Patrol and Silver Nemesis.\nIn the 1990s, Clough directed several episodes of The Bill and he also started producing the show in the latter half of the decade. He then went on to produce several other series, including Ballykissangel, Black Cab, and The Ghost Squad. He produced the E4 Teen Drama Skins, running from 2007 to 2013, and Channel 4 drama Sirens in 2011.

The production team tried to get Prince Edward involved in the show, but his office politely declined in March 1988; the programme instead used an Elizabeth II look-alike.
