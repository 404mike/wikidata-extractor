The Crown was represented by Horace Edmund Avory, assisted by Guy Stephenson, while the defence was headed by an experienced barrister, Charles Gill, who was assisted by Percival Clarke. The judge was Sir Forrest Fulton, who, as a prosecutor, had been responsible for sending John Smith to prison in 1877.", "England did not yet have a court of criminal appeal, but between 1896 and 1901 Beck's solicitor presented ten petitions for re-examination of his case. His requests to see the prison's description of John Smith were repeatedly denied. However, in May 1898 an official at the Home Office looked at the Smith file and saw that Smith was Jewish and thus had been circumcised, while Beck was not. The Home Office asked Sir Forrest Fulton for his opinion of this new evidence. Fulton wrote a minute dated 13 May in which he acknowledged that Smith and Beck could not be the same person, but he added that even if Beck was not Smith, he was still the impostor of 1895, and that he viewed the South American alibi \"with great suspicion.\" As a result, the letter W was removed from Beck's prison number, but nothing else was done regarding the case.", "Eventually a Committee of Inquiry was established, headed by the noted jurist and Master of the Rolls, Sir Richard Henn Collins. It heard evidence from all those involved in the case, including Horace Avory and Sir Forrest Fulton. In its report, it concluded that Adolph Beck should not have been convicted in the first place due to the many errors made by the prosecution in presenting its case.  The Committee also chastised Judge Fulton in his conduct on the case, as he should have given consideration to the 1877 case, more so because of his involvement with the 1877 case, which served to prejudice the proceedings against Beck.  Furthermore, it criticised the Home Office for its indifference in acting on the case despite the fact that it had known since 1898 that Beck and Smith were not the same man. Instead, it sought to preserve the credibility of the judiciary rather than admit or correct its mistakes. It also stated that the omission of the prison authorities to state the fact of Smith's circumcision in the records of 1877 and 1881 was the primary cause of the miscarriage of justice."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Forrest Fulton"]}, {"page": "Recorder of London", "response": ["* 1900\u201322 \u2013 Sir Forrest Fulton"]}, {"page": "West Ham North (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Forrest Fulton"]}, {"page": "Archibald Grove", "response": ["Grove was a member of the Liberal Party, and unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Winchester in 1886.
