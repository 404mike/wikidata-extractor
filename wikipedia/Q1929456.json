She has been a member of bands in the 1970s such as Oyster Ceilidh Band, Fiddler's Dram, and The Albion Band. She released a solo album, Surface, in 1985, the same year that she appeared as a guest vocalist on the Fairport Convention album Gladys' Leap. She created and ran the World in 1 County festival from 2002 to 2007. In November 2009, she released the solo single \"This Christmas\", which was written by her husband, David Wilson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fairport Convention", "response": ["In 1985, Pegg, Nicol and Mattacks found that they all had some free time and an available studio belonging to Pegg. They decided that they needed some new material to add to the catalogue that had been suspended in 1978. As Swarbrick was unavailable, the selection of traditional tunes was more difficult than for past albums and there was a need for a replacement fiddle player and some vocals. Pegg and Nicol took over arranging duties on an instrumental medley and the band turned to sometime Albion Band members: jazz and folk violinist Ric Sanders and singer-songwriter Cathy Lesurf. They also had the help of ex-member Richard Thompson. Thompson and Lesurf contributed songs and took part in the recordings. Also important to the album was Ralph McTell who contributed one song and co-wrote one track each with Nicol and Mattacks; the former of these, \"The Hiring Fair\", would become a stage fixture of the future Fairport."]}, {"page": "Stevenage", "response": ["* Cathy Lesurf, singer and member of bands such as Oysterband, Fiddler's Dram, Fairport Convention and The Albion Country Band"]}, {"page": "British folk rock", "response": ["A much smaller group of English bands were formed in emulation of existing folk rock bands. Most often the model seems to have been Steeleye Span, as it was for the Cambridge group Spriguns of Tolgus, the Northumbrian band Hedgehog Pie and the Oyster Band, who started as the unpromising Fiddler's Dram in 1978. Fiddler's Dram were often dismissed as \"one hit wonders\" for their single \"Day Trip to Bangor\", which peaked at no 3 in the UK and for their clear status as \"Steeleye Span soundalikes\". What was remarkable is that they proved to have a singer-songwriter of genuine talent in Cathy Lesurf, and after she had left for the Albion Band in 1980 they became the Oyster Band (sometimes the Oysterband), an increasingly heavy and politically aware folk rock unit who produced some of the best work in the genre in the 1980s and 1990s, merging into the developing folk punk and independent scenes.M.

An album from this relatively stable period was Light Shining (1983), on which most of the tracks were original material. However, the reputation of the album has since been marred by accusations that Hutchings plagiarized one of its songs, \"Wolfe,\" from \"Northwest Passage\" by Canadian folksinger Stan Rogers.Garnet Rogers, Night Drive: Travels with My Brother (Brampton, ON: Tickle Shore Publishing, 2016), pp 400-401 ", "Shuffle Off (1983) followed, after which Nicol and Mattacks left to reform Fairport Convention.

The line-up then shifted with Martin Bell joining on violin before the release of Stella Maris in (1987). Martin Bell and Cathy Lesurf then left and the group were joined by Simon Care and John Shepherd.
