He lost the seat to Labour at the 1945 general election.\nHe was the chief chemist at Lunts of Port Sunlight near Liverpool. He changed his name from Davies to Wootton-Davies after marrying Shirley Wotton (who added an extra o in Wotton because she felt it was too common) thus becoming Wootton-Davies.\nHe lived in Starlings Castle, Bronygarth, then moved to Bronwilfa Hall near Wrexham where James Henry died in 1964.\nJames Henry owned a farm called Gilar near Pentrefoelas which he gave to his son James William Wootton-Davies as a wedding present.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Port Sunlight", "response": ["*James Wootton-Davies (1884\u20131964), politician, worked as a chemist in Port Sunlight"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|James Wootton-Davies"]}, {"page": "Heywood and Radcliffe (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James Wootton-Davies"]}, {"page": "1940 Heywood and Radcliffe by-election", "response": ["The Heywood and Radcliffe by-election of 1940 was held on 28 August 1940.
