He lost the seat to Labour at the 1945 general election.\nHe was the chief chemist at Lunts of Port Sunlight near Liverpool. He changed his name from Davies to Wootton-Davies after marrying Shirley Wotton (who added an extra o in Wotton because she felt it was too common) thus becoming Wootton-Davies.\nHe lived in Starlings Castle, Bronygarth, then moved to Bronwilfa Hall near Wrexham where James Henry died in 1964.\nJames Henry owned a farm called Gilar near Pentrefoelas which he gave to his son James William Wootton-Davies as a wedding present.", "link_mentions": {}}}
