Following the departure of Hall in 1936, Breedon was unable to capitalise as new signing Tommy Breen was installed as first-choice goalkeeper. Breedon made 13 league appearances in total during his first three years at Old Trafford, but became more involved in the first team during the 1938\u201339 season as United achieved a 14th-place finish in the First Division.
