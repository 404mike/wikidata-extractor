They maintain a worldwide cult following, and are an inspiration for many female rock musicians.

Her place in the band was briefly taken by visiting American Kathy Valentine, who approached the band through an advertisement in the British music newspaper Melody Maker. When Valentine returned to the United States in 1978 to form the Textones and later join The Go-Go's as bass player, Painted Lady broke up. However, McAuliffe and Williams were still willing to pursue a musical career to escape their day jobs in a bank and a bakery; they reformed the band, recruiting lead guitarist Kelly Johnson and drummer Denise Dufort in April 1978. The new line-up changed their name to Girlschool\u2014taking it from \"Girls' School\", the B-side of the hit single \"Mull of Kintyre\" (1977) by Paul McCartney and Wings\u2014 and immediately hit the road, touring small venues in France, Ireland and Great Britain.", "thumb|right|300px|Girlschool original line-up: Kim McAuliffe, Enid Williams, Kelly Johnson, Denise Dufort (1981)", "Back in England, the continuous succession of recording sessions, gigs and promotional work started again, but the strain of this routine was wearing out Kelly Johnson, who was also tired of the music the band had been playing for four years without a break. The other members struggled to convince her to stay and the chance to record with British celebrities Noddy Holder and Jim Lea as producers persuaded the guitarist to carry on with Girlschool. Holder and Lea, who had returned in those years to great success and popularity in Great Britain with the 70s rock band Slade, were hired to produce only a single, with the following album already scheduled to be recorded in Los Angeles with Quiet Riot producer Spencer Proffer. However, the good chemistry found with the two Slade members led the band to decide to record not a single, but their whole fourth studio album in North London with Lea and Holder, giving up the trip to the USA. This time the group changed sensibly both their appearance and their musical style in order to appeal to a large American audience, which Bronze considered more oriented toward AOR and glam rock than to the 'biker metal' Girlschool had produced before. Play Dirty, released in October 1983, is an album with a very polished sound, filled with keyboards, choruses and melodies, but it lacks much of the aggression and power of the preceding works. The album contains covers of the Slade songs \"High & Dry\" and \"Burning in the Heat\" and of T.Rex\u2019s \"20th Century Boy\", which was also released as a single. Play Dirty failed to enter the top 50 chart in the UK and had a lukewarm reception by fans and critics at home. A struggle between Bronze and PolyGram for the worldwide contract of the band resulted also in poor promotion for the album in the USA. Moreover, a disastrous performance at Wembley Arena supporting ZZ Top did not help Girlschool's already degraded image in Great Britain.", "Girlschool embarked in a long US tour to promote the album, sometimes as support to Quiet Riot and Blue \u00d6yster Cult, but more often as headliner in small venues after uncomfortable travels. Johnson, unable to tolerate the unhealthy life on the road, quit the band before completing the US tour, hurting the promotion of the album in America. She went to live in Los Angeles with Vicki Blue, former bassist of The Runaways. With the departure of Kelly Johnson, who was often considered the visual and musical focal point of the band, the almost bankrupt Bronze Records failed to extend the band's recording contract for a follow-up album.", "After a few European dates, returning bassist Tracey Lamb replaced Carrera before a new tour in the United States. But more line-up changes were in store for the band because, at the end of 1992, Cris Bonacci left the band to become a touring musician and then a producer. In 1993, her place as lead guitarist was taken back by Kelly Johnson, who returned after nine years to England from LA, where she had played in a band with Kathy Valentine and written and produced her own music. The plethora of compilations of old Girlschool material that had started to be released from 1989 kept the band alive on the CD market and guaranteed enough visibility to get a good number of gigs every year in every part of the world, often supporting other NWOBHM acts like Mot\u00f6rhead or Saxon. In this period, the girls were also present at rock festivals all over Europe, both as Girlschool or separately in other outfits. In 1995, Communiqu\u00e9 Records released Girlschool Live, a live album documenting the intense live shows of the band in that period and which included the new tracks \"Knife\" and \"Little Green Men\". Girlschool continued their live activity in the 1990s, culminating with a participation to the Wacken Open Air festival on Friday, 6 August 1999.", "On 15 July 2007, Kelly Johnson died of spinal cancer, after six years of painful therapy and treatment of her illness. At Kelly's memorial, Tracey Lamb read the eulogy she had written for her. The band performed a tribute gig on 20 August 2007 at the Soho Revue Bar in London, with many of Johnson's friends and former Girlschool's members and a concert for Cancer Research UK at Rock of Ages Fest in Tamworth on 8 September 2007.", "The new album Legacy, released in October 2008, celebrates both the departed guitarist and the 30th anniversary of Girlschool, making them the so far longest running female rock band in the world. The recording was self-produced with the assistance of Tim Hamill and the compositions are more individual, revealing a large array of influences, going from NWOBHM, to punk, to West Coast alternative rock. To emphasize the celebrative mood, the album features many guest musicians, with members of Heaven & Hell, Twisted Sister and Mot\u00f6rhead supplying vocals and guitars in many tracks. Kelly Johnson's 'ghost' presence permeates the album and the song \"Legend\" is especially dedicated to her. The album received excellent reviews and the German label SPV/Steamhammer guaranteed the worldwide distribution. Girlschool performed a special show celebrating their 30th anniversary on 16 December at the Astoria 2 in London.", "Revolver magazine editor Christopher Scapelliti aptly described Girlschool's music as a \"punk-metal mix tough, but poppy enough for radio\". The influences of classic hard rock and heavy metal are present in the musical background of all the original band members and they are particularly evident in the clean and sometimes bluesy solo guitar work of Kelly Johnson. Artists like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, David Bowie, T. Rex, Suzi Quatro have been influential on the Girlschool members.", "The fact of being a band composed of girls, beside the obvious marketing gimmick based on sexuality, has always been perceived as a handicap in the sexist and male-dominated heavy metal scene, especially in the early 1980s, when metal was rapidly taking the place of punk music in the tastes of many young males in Great Britain. However, Girlschool's good musicianship and their aggressive but fun-loving attitude quickly won the NWOBHM audience, which treated them with respect, forming a loyal fan base. In Kelly Johnson's word, Girlschool were so well accepted because \"most of the audience is headbangers and they spend most of the time banging their heads and hardly look at us\".", "British specialized press took notice of the band and especially weekly magazines like Sounds and later Kerrang! dedicated covers to Girlschool and had frequent articles for either their stage performances or for their off-stage drinking bouts and 'no-nonsense attitude', during their period of maximum media exposition and chart success. In 1980, Sounds voted the band second 'Best Newcomer' and Kelly Johnson third 'Best Female Vocalist'. Two years later, Kerrang! still voted Kelly Johnson second 'Best Female Vocalist' and best 'Female Pin-up'. In that period, British radio stations gladly broadcast Girlschool's singles and the band was also guest of music TV shows, culminating with a performance at Top of the Pops in April 1981 to promote the single \"Hit and Run\"."]}, {"page": "Kelly Johnson", "response": ["Kelly Johnson may refer to:", "*Kelly Johnson (engineer) (1910\u20131990), American aeronautical engineer", "*Kelly Johnson (baseball) (born 1982), American baseball player", "*Kelly Johnson (figure skater) (born 1961), Canadian ice dancer", "*Kelly Johnson (guitarist) (1958\u20132007), English lead guitarist with rock band Girlschool"]}, {"page": "List of lead guitarists", "response": ["* Kelly Johnson (Girlschool)"]}, {"page": "List of female heavy metal singers", "response": ["*Kelly Johnson (Girlschool)"]}, {"page": "Demolition (Girlschool album)", "response": ["#\"Demolition Boys\" (Kim McAuliffe, Kelly Johnson) \u2013 3:39", "* Kelly Johnson \u2013 lead guitar, vocals on tracks 6, 15"]}, {"page": "Hit and Run (Girlschool album)", "response": ["* Kelly Johnson \u2013 lead guitar, vocals on tracks 1, 2, 7, 11, 12"]}, {"page": "Screaming Blue Murder (Girlschool album)", "response": ["#\"Screaming Blue Murder\" (Kelly Johnson, Kim McAuliffe, Gil Weston) \u2013 3:34 ", "* Kelly Johnson \u2013 lead guitar, lead vocals on tracks 1, 4, 6, 9"]}, {"page": "Play Dirty (album)", "response": ["It was the first Girlschool album not to enter the UK Top 40 album chart and signalled a general downturn in their career, along with an inclination towards a softer rock sound.

Unlike many heavy metal bands, Girlschool often had more than one lead vocalist, with vocal duties in the 'classic' line-up shared amongst Williams, McAuliffe and Johnson.", "Williams was the first to leave the band, in 1982, under very stressful circumstances, and was replaced by punk rocker Gil Weston. Kelly Johnson left in 1984 and went to live in the United States.", "In 1993, Kelly Johnson came back to England from the US and found her place again in Girlschool, replacing the departing Bonacci.

She divided her time between London and Los Angeles, where she composed and performed her own music until March 2012, when she returned to live in Leeds.
