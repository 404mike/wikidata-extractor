She is found living in poverty by her father and entrusted to the care of Mansfield and his wife.

Lady Elizabeth, by contrast, will have no income from her father, whose son from his new wife has been named his sole heir. Arrangements are made for Elizabeth to have her coming-out to society, but Lord and Lady Mansfield believe no gentleman will agree to marry Dido because of her mixed-race status, as well as concerns of lower ranking men only marrying her for her wealth, she will travel to London with her cousin, she will not be \"out\" to society.", "* Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Dido Elizabeth Belle, the protagonist.

In the film \"Tom Wilkinson\u2019s Mansfield finds his cold legal commercial heart softened, and edged towards abolition by the eyelash-fluttering efforts of his stunning great niece\" and his \"adjudication becomes, not a point of law, but the first bold assertion towards the end of slavery\".
