He was also a member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and after his expulsion from that organisation in 1951, founded the Republican splinter group Saor Uladh and its political wing Fianna Uladh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clann na Poblachta", "response": ["In keeping with the republican views of many of its key supporters, Clann had throughout maintained close links with republicans in Northern Ireland who espoused similar views, accepting the 1937 Constitution and the government operating under it as legitimate in the Republic of Ireland (differing from Sinn F\u00e9in on this issue) but keeping open the option of armed struggle in Northern Ireland. The most prominent link of this kind was between the Clann and Liam Kelly and his Fianna Uladh organisation, even though Kelly and the Fianna Uladh's armed wing (Saor Uladh) were engaged in a military campaign in Northern Ireland. In 1954 the Clann made Kelly's election to Seanad \u00c9ireann (courtesy of Fine Gael councillors' votes) a condition for supporting the Second Inter-Party Government. Kelly had been imprisoned at the time for making a seditious speech.Sean MacBride \u2013 a Life by Elizabeth Keane p. 211"]}, {"page": "Border campaign (Irish Republican Army)", "response": ["By 1955, splits were occurring in the IRA, as several small groups, impatient for action, launched their own attacks in Northern Ireland. One such activist, Brendan O'Boyle blew himself up with his own bomb in the summer of that year. Another, Liam Kelly founded a breakaway group Saor Uladh (\"Free Ulster\") and in November 1955, attacked a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) barracks at Roslea in County Fermanagh. One RUC man was badly injured and a Republican fighter was killed in the incident. In August of the following year, Kelly and another IRA dissident, Joe Christle, burned down some customs posts on the border."]}, {"page": "Carrickmore", "response": ["*Quinns Corner: On the corner of Main Street and Creggan Road, this elevated platform in the centre of the village (formerly a Hotel and latterly a Public House) was the setting for speeches given by many prominent political figures, including Michael Davitt, Roger Casement, Constance Markievicz, \u00c9amon de Valera, Gerry Adams, Tom\u00e1s Mac Giolla, Liam Kelly and Bernadette Devlin. It is also the place the local sporting teams return to after winning contests. It now lies derelict."]}]}}
