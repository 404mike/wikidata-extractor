A leading proponent of the new flamenco style, he was one of the first flamenco guitarists to branch into classical and jazz. Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton, authors of Guitar: Music, History, Players, describe de Luc\u00eda as a \"titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar\", and Dennis Koster, author of Guitar Atlas, Flamenco, has referred to de Luc\u00eda as \"one of history's greatest guitarists\".", "His compositions La Ca\u00f1ada, the opening track, a tango called La Barrosa, an alegr\u00edas named after the Playa la Barrosa in the province of Cadiz, and Gloria al Ni\u00f1o Ricardo, a sol\u00e9a, received considerable attention and are considered modern flamenco classics. Eric Clapton and Richard Chapman described La Barrosa, a sweet alegr\u00edas played in B major, as, \"full of effortless delicacy with cascading phrases.\" \"Gloria al Ni\u00f1o Ricardo\" is dedicated to Ni\u00f1o Ricardo who was de Luc\u00eda's \"first hero\" of the guitar. Several of his compositions from that album form the staple of his contemporary concert performances, and he often begins his concerts with La Ca\u00f1ada.", "Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton describe de Luc\u00eda as a \"titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar\", highlighting his \"astounding technique and inventiveness\" and his broad range of musical ideas from other styles, such as Brazilian music and jazz. He is noted for his innovation and colour in harmony and his remarkable dexterity, technique, strength and fluidity in his right hand, capable of executing extremely fast and fluent picados. A master of contrast, he often juxtaposes picados with rasgueados and other techniques and often adds abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences."]}, {"page": "La Barrosa", "response": ["Eric Clapton and Richard Chapman described the piece as \"full of effortless delicacy with cascading phrases\"."]}, {"page": "Richard Chapman", "response": ["Richard Chapman may refer to:", "*Richard Chapman (cricketer) (1918-2004), South African cricketer", "*Richard Chapman (MP) (died 1580), Member of Parliament (MP) for Bath", "*Richard Chapman (musician) (born 1956), British guitarist, composer and author", "*Richard Chapman (shipwright) (1520\u2013c. 1592), owner of a private shipyard at Deptford"]}, {"page": "Cepa Andaluza", "response": ["Jazz Forum cite \"Cepa Andaluza\" and \"Entre dos Aguas\" as among his most popular compositions, both appearing on his 1973 album Fuente y caudal.
