He was born at Ongar, Essex, and died at St Mary in the Marsh, Kent.\nThe son of Henry J. Parker who was Gresham Professor of Divinity and vicar of High Halden in Kent, Parker was educated at Maidstone and at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Parker played most of his early cricket as a middle-order batsman, though he rarely seemed to make many runs; an exception was his solitary appearance in the University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford in 1839, in which he made 43, by some distance his best score in first-class cricket. After a solitary appearance for Kent in 1841, the rest of his cricket was played for the amateur Gentlemen of Kent side, and though detailed scorecards from his era are not often available, he seems to have developed as a bowler: against the Gentlemen of England in 1845, he batted at No 11 but took four wickets, though the scorecard also records he bowled 12 wides. It is not known whether batted or bowled right- or left-handed, nor his style of bowling.\nParker graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1842. He was ordained as a Church of England clergyman and served as curate to his father at High Halden from 1842 to 1849. He then moved to Old Romney for four years, then to Whitstable and Seasalter, all in Kent, before becoming rector of St Mary in the Marsh in 1857, where he stayed in post until his death 44 years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Parker", "response": ["Henry Parker may refer to:", "* Henry Parker (MP for Bedford) (by 1509\u20131551), MP for Bedford", "* Sir Henry Parker (MP for Hertfordshire) (died 1552), MP for Hertfordshire", "* Sir Henry Parker, 2nd Baronet (1638\u20131713), English politician", "* Henry Parker (bishop) (1852\u20131888), Anglican bishop in Africa", "* Henry Parker (writer) (1604\u20131652), political writer during the English Civil War", "* Henry Parker (Georgia official) (c. 1690\u2013c. 1777), colonial governor of the U.S. state of Georgia", "* Sir Henry Parker (Australian politician) (1808\u20131881), Premier of New South Wales", "* Henry Parker (cricketer) (1819\u20131901), English clergyman and cricketer", "* Henry Parker (author), British engineer in 19th century colonial Sri Lanka, author of Ancient Ceylon and Village folk-tales of Ceylon", "* Henry Parker, 10th Baron Morley (c. 1480\u2013c. 1553/6), English peer and translator", "* Henry Parker, 11th Baron Morley (1533\u20131577), English peer", "* Henry Parker, 14th Baron Morley (c. 1600\u20131655)", "* Henry Parker (Royal Navy officer) (born 1963), British admiral"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Henry Parker"]}, {"page": "List of Cambridge Town Club and Cambridgeshire cricketers", "response": ["* Henry Parker (1840) : H.
