Their muskets were re-loaded for them by the wounded soldiers under the parapet and eventually the enemy fell back and gave no more trouble.He later served in the Second Anglo-Chinese War and achieved the rank of Captain of the AfterGuard. He is buried in the Old Balmain Cemetery, Norton Street, Leichhardt, New South Wales, Australia, which in 1944 was closed and converted to a public park, \"Pioneers Memorial Park\". There is a plaque in his memory on the War Memorial in Loyalty Square, Balmain.", "link_mentions": {}}}
