Rosing sang on the original BBC recording of \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\" as well as \"In a Little Gypsy Tea Room\". He also sang on the Ray Noble Orchestra's version of \"Try a Little Tenderness\", the first recording of this well-covered song. Rosing recorded more than one hundred sides with various English bands, including Spike Hughes and His Decca-Dents, the Jack Payne Orchestra, Jack Hylton's Orchestra and Rosing's own Radio Rhythm Rascals.\nIn 1938, Rosing moved to America at the urging of Louis B. Mayer, who renamed him Gilbert Russell, with hopes of making Rosing the \"English Bing Crosby\". His years at MGM were uneventful and, after his stint with the studio, Rosing sang and acted in musicals and light operas around the country. Making the transition from pop to \"legitimate\" singer, Rosing legally changed his name to Gilbert Russell and sang in Chicago Theater of the Air, the NY Opera Company, and the San Francisco Opera.\nIn the 1960s, Rosing worked as one of Hollywood's top vocal coaches, with students that included Natalie Wood, George Chakiris, June Lockhart and Tina Louise.\nRosing was married three times.  The first, in 1932, was to English actress Meriel Carrington.  They had a daughter, the artist Anna Edouard. His second marriage was in 1953 to Marilyn Pendry, a dancer in movies such as White Christmas and An American in Paris. They had one daughter, Claudia Russell, before divorcing.

Rosing planned to produce, write and direct the production. After a disappointing failure to win bi-partisan support in the Northern and Southern states for this ambitious project, Rosing then conceived of an even bigger production that would instead tell the story of freedom itself. The Freedom Story would be an ambassador of freedom and peace, sent from America to the rest of the world, performing in local languages. Rosing wanted to use the power of art to fight the forces of totalitarianism that he saw threatening America's freedom. The project won wide support, with an Advisory Board that included Alf Landon, Harry S. Truman, and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
