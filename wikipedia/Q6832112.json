He was first elected as a Socialist Alliance candidate shortly after the Iraq War began in 2003. In 2007, he was re-elected, this time standing for the Respect Party. In the Respect split in 2007 he remained loyal to the SWP and broke with George Galloway. Re-elected in 2012 as an Independent Socialist, he was affiliated with TUSC until he retired from his seat in 2015.He is Everton Professor of Social and Community Engagement at Liverpool Hope University, formerly having worked at both Liverpool and Central Lancashire universities. Along with Chris Jones, Iain Feguson, and Laura Penketh, he was an author of the Social Work manifesto for a new engaged practice and organiser of the Liverpool and Glasgow conferences of the Social Work Action Network (SWAN), which stands in the radical social work tradition and seeks to oppose the increased managerialism and privatisation within the social work profession, and to promote social work practice based on principles of social justice.At the end of 2008 the Social Work Action Network ran a campaign defending social workers in the aftermath of the Baby P tragedy. Shortly after, along with Iain Ferguson, he wrote a polemical pamphlet called 'Social Work After Baby P' that included significant contributions from academics, practitioners and senior trade union officers.Lavalette originally joined his local Labour Party in North Ayrshire at the age of 16 in 1979, but by January 1981 he had left to join the SWP. In the early 1990s he moved to Preston for work and became politically active in the local labour movement.\nIn Preston he is the co-ordinator of the local Stop the War Coalition. He organised a solidarity day in Preston for victims of the Asian Tsunami and has led campaigns against hospital privatisation, Islamophobia, the wars in the Middle East and support for local trade unionists on strike.\nIn May 2007 he was re-elected to Preston council and held his seat until May 2011, when he lost it to Labour. In December 2010  Lavalette proposed a motion to Preston City Council calling for opposition to cuts, job losses and privatisations. The motion had the backing of the local trades council and of 'Preston Against Cuts'. 5 Labour councillors had voted and spoken in favour of this motion at these meetings. When it came to the full council meeting however, all the Labour councillors voted against this motion, and for an amendment supporting 'fairer' cuts backed by the Liberals and Tories.In May 2012, he contested the seat again as a Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition supported candidate and was re-elected.\nLavalette regularly contributes to the Lancashire Evening Post.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Preston (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The 2005 general election was notable for the changes in share of the vote of the minor parties.

Prior to the second half of the twentieth century, the Home Children programme was seen as a way to move impoverished children to a \"better life\" in Australia, Canada and elsewhere, also providing good \"white stock\" to former colonies.  The children and parents were not consulted, and often siblings were separated.Child Labor By Sandy Hobbs, Jim McKechnie, Michael Lavalette p. 33, 34 In total 130,000 children were sent from the United Kingdom to Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and Australia.  Often children were lied to about their parents being dead and many faced abuse in their new homes. In February 2010 British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown issued an official apology for the 'shameful' child resettlement programme and announced a \u00a36 million fund designed to compensate the families affected by the \"misguided\" programme. The Child Migrants Trust has since set up the Family Restoration Fund in order to use this money to help reunite former child migrants with their families as part of the British government's package of support to former child migrants and their families."]}, {"page": "Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition", "response": ["TUSC stood 132 candidates in 38 councils, with 17 candidates for the Greater London Assembly.
