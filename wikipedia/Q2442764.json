One writer called him \"the most famous non-famous person in London\". According to Lynne Truss, Green became such a ubiquitous figure in and around Oxford Street in the West End that, like Zelig, he was \"present in every black-and-white picture of London crowds that one has ever seen\".For 25 years, from 1968 until 1993, Green patrolled Oxford Street with a placard recommending \"protein wisdom\", a low-protein diet that he said would dampen the libido and make people kinder. His 14-page self-published pamphlet, Eight Passion Proteins with Care went through 84 editions and sold 87,000 copies over 20 years.Green's \"campaigning for the suppression of desire\", as one writer described it, was not always popular, but Londoners developed an affection for him. The Sunday Times interviewed him in 1985, and the fashion house Red or Dead used his \"less passion from less protein\" slogan in one of its collections. When he died aged 78, the Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The Times all published obituaries, and the Museum of London acquired his pamphlets and placards. In 2006 his biography was included in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northolt", "response": ["* Stanley Green (1915\u20131993), a human billboard, lived in Northolt."]}, {"page": "Oxford Street", "response": ["The human billboard Stanley Green began selling on Oxford Street in 1968, advertising his belief in the link of proteins to sexual libido and the dangers therein.
