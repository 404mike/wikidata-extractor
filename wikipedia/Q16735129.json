Legal advice is provided by Rights of Women, a charity which works to help women through the law. In the same year, she joined a G7 gender equality advisory group convened by the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, to \"call on G7 to make political and economic advances for women within their own countries\" as well as a \"centerpiece of foreign policy\". She attended their first meeting at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris in February and attended the 45th G7 summit in August as part of the committee. In an interview with Paris Lees, she voiced her support for transgender rights, reiterating this on Twitter amidst controversy concerning J. K. Rowling's remarks on gender identity. Watson has spoken out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement; in June 2020, she shared anti-racism educational resources on social media in support of the George Floyd protests after initially participating in Blackout Tuesday, and uploaded a podcast episode onto Spotify interviewing Reni Eddo-Lodge about her book Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race. In July 2020, she partnered with Lodge and the WOW Foundation to spearhead a project reimagining the London Underground Map, renaming the 270 stops to spotlight women and non-binary people who have shaped the city's history. The initiative will consult writers, museums, and librarians and is set to be published by Haymarket Books on International Women's Day 2021. Watson was among the 400 signatories in a letter calling for the UK government to include women in \"decision-making roles\" at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. In June 2021,  it was reported that Watson was part of a group of investors funding $12.5 million into FabricNano, a startup developing sustainable alternatives to petrochemical products."]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Reni Eddo-Lodge"]}, {"page": "Asana", "response": ["In a secular context, the journalists Nell Frizzell and Reni Eddo-Lodge have debated (in The Guardian) whether Western yoga classes represent \"cultural appropriation\".
