In his career Fry scored 508 runs at an average of 10.58, with a single half century which yielded his highest first-class score of 78. As a wicketkeeper Fry took sixteen catches and made one stumping. His retirement from first-class cricket followed his final match of the 1931 season which came against Warwickshire.
