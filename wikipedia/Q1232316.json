Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger proposed the name Dicerorhinus in 1841. In 1868, John Edward Gray proposed the name Ceratorhinus.

Following Cuvier's identification, German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach gave the woolly mammoth its scientific name, Elephas primigenius, in 1799, placing it in the same genus as the Asian elephant. This name is Latin for \"the first-born elephant\". Cuvier coined the name Elephas mammonteus a few months later, but the former name was subsequently used.

The chief surgeon (John Freke) appears as a magistrate, watching over the examination of the murderer Tom Nero's body by the Company of Surgeons.  According to author Fiona Haslam, the scene reflects a popular view that surgeons were \"on the whole, disreputable, insensitive to human suffering and prone to victimis[ing] people in the same way that criminals victimised their prey.\"  Another popular belief alluded to by Hogarth was that surgeons were so ignorant of the respect due to their subjects, that they allowed the remains to become offal.  In reality, the rough treatment exacted by body snatchers on corpses continued on the premises they delivered to.  Joshua Brookes once admitted that he had kicked a corpse in a sack down a flight of stairs, while Robert Christison complained of the \"shocking indecency without any qualifying wit\" demonstrated by a male lecturer who dissected a woman.
