As of 2014 Davidson remained the record appearances holder for Hull City, having played 579 times for the club from 1952 to 1968, despite suffering from a broken leg three times during his career.\nDavidson arrived at the club after his brother David, six years his senior, had joined the Tigers in 1946 after his work as a long-distance lorry driver brought him south to Hull docks and a brazen request for a trial had been enough to win over manager Frank Buckley at the newly opened Boothferry Park. He made his debut against Blackburn Rovers in 1952, playing as a centre-forward, but established himself as a tough-tacking full-back over 18 seasons with the club.\nAfter retiring through injury in 1968, Davidson remained with Hull City until 1979, working as a scout, coach, and as assistant manager to both John Kaye and Ken Houghton. After leaving the club he lived in South Cave, with his wife Susan. He died aged 81 on 5 April 2014, in a nursing home in Beverley, East Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hull City A.F.C.", "response": ["Andy Davidson holds the record for Hull City league appearances, having played 579 matches.

He chose to join the Tigers ahead of bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester City who had shown interest in signing him due to the fact that Hull were managed by Raich Carter, who had been a great player before and after World War II. Carter did improve Revie's game but was not a success as Hull manager, as City finished mid-table in 1949\u201350 and 1950\u201351, before becoming involved in a relegation battle in 1951\u201352. Teammate Andy Davidson later said Revie failed to fulfil his potential at Boothferry Park as he was not a tough player, and the rest of the Hull team were not physically dominant enough to protect him and allow him to dictate play with his accurate passing. As at Leicester, Revie felt the time had come for him to move on and handed in a transfer request once Carter departed."]}, {"page": "List of Hull City A.F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|Andy Davidson"]}, {"page": "Andy Davidson", "response": ["Andy Davidson may refer to:", "*Andy Davidson (footballer) (1932\u20132014), Hull City appearance record holder", "*Andy Davidson (game designer), British video game designer", "*Andy Davidson (Torchwood), a fictional character on the BBC science fiction series Torchwood, portrayed by actor Tom Price", "*Andy Davidson, author of The Boatman's Daughter"]}, {"page": "Bill Bradbury (footballer, born 1933)", "response": ["Despite joining halfway through the season, Bradbury finished as Hull's leading scorer, with nine league goals as the club were relegated from the Second Division.
