Sage described Septimus Heap's world as a place where numerous creatures and people suddenly appear and become involved in events. Commenting on the development of the Septimus Heap character, Sage has described him as someone in a strange and hostile world who has no idea of his real identity.

In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is nothing at all to do with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical\u00a0... And as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example.

They are, but by highlighting certain aspects of their personality, she makes it easy for the reader to think of real people in terms of these characters.
