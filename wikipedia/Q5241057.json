Fiona Ellis says that while Oppy's view is common, it is dependent on a narrow view of naturalism. She describes the \"expansive naturalism\" of John McDowell, James Griffin and David Wiggins as giving \"due respect to scientific findings\" while also asserting there are things in human experience which cannot be explained in such terms, such as the concept of value, leaving room for theism.  Christopher C. Knight asserts a theistic naturalism that relies on what he terms an \"incarnational naturalism\" (the doctrine of immanence) and does not require any special mode of divine action that would put it outside nature. Nevertheless, Oppy argues that a strong naturalism favors atheism, though he finds the best direct arguments against theism to be the evidential problem of evil, and arguments concerning the contradictory nature of God were He to exist."]}, {"page": "D.
