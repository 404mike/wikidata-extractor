Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the leading theatre manager of his day, agreed to present one of the newly discovered plays with John Philip Kemble in the starring role. Excitement over the biographical and literary significance of the find turned to acrimony, however, when it was charged that the documents were forgeries. Edmond Malone, widely regarded as the greatest Shakespeare scholar of his time, conclusively showed that the language, orthography, and handwriting were not those of the times and persons to which they were credited. William Henry Ireland, the supposed discoverer, then confessed to the fraud.", "His son William Henry Ireland had a fascination with forgery. He was heavily influenced by the novel Love and Madness by Herbert Croft which contained lengthy passages on the forger Thomas Chatterton. William witnessed his father's frustration first-hand. One moment, in particular, struck him forcibly. Knowing that the furniture and papers from New Place, Shakespeare's last residence, had been moved to Clopton house when New Place was demolished, Samuel Ireland reasoned that Shakespearean manuscripts might well be found there.Samuel Ireland, Picturesque Views on the Upper, or Warwickshire, Avon (London 1796), p. 204; William Henry says that old residents told them papers had been moved there at the time of the Stratford fire. Upon visiting however, he was informed by the current tenant that all the old papers\u2014many of them Shakespeare's\u2014had recently been burned. Samuel Ireland's distress at this news made a strong impression on the young man\u2014even though it later turned out that this story was nothing more than a joke at Ireland's expense.William Henry Ireland related this story in the Authentic Account (pp. 5\u20136), the Confessions (pp. 30\u201333), and the unpublished Full and Explanatory Account (according to Schoenbaum, p. 192). Edmond Malone investigated the incident, writing to the owner about the propriety of a tenant destroying his landlord's papers; the tenant denied the incident and admitted it was a practical joke. Mair, pp. 19\u201320, and Schoenbaum, p. 193, have brief accounts of the subsequent investigation of the incident. According to the younger Ireland's confessions, it was to please his father that he embarked on the career of literary forgery that would ultimately ruin them both.Confessions, p. 302.", "From a chance acquaintance met at a book-binder's the young man learned of a technique for simulating the appearance of ancient writing by using a special ink and then heating the paper.William Henry Ireland, Authentic Account, p. 4. After a trial run creating a couple of relatively insignificant documents, he set out to devise something with Shakespeare's signature. His work at a legal firm gave him access to Elizabethan and Jacobean parchment deeds, so in December 1794 he cut a piece of parchment from one of them, used his special ink to write with and heated it over a candle. The result was a mortgage deed between Shakespeare and his fellow-actor John Heminges on one side, and Michael Fraser and his wife on the other.  The text and signature he copied from the facsimile of the genuine 1612 mortgage deed printed in Malone's edition of Shakespeare.Schoenbaum, p. 197; in his published accounts William Henry Ireland claims to have used the Johnson-Steevens edition, but the Blackfriars mortgage deed he used as a basis for the forgery did not appear there, and was first printed in Malone's edition. In his unpublished accounts he admitted to using Malone's edition. Ripping a seal from another early deed, young Ireland attached it to this concoction and presented the result to his father on 16 December. Samuel Ireland accepted it as authentic, and the next day took it to the Heralds' Office, which approved it as genuine.Mair, pp. 27\u201329.", "With his next discovery William Henry moved from mere forgery to original art.Mair, The Fourth Forger, p. 31. Having learned\u2014apparently from a chance remark by one of his father's friends rather than by research\u2014that Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton had been Shakespeare's patron, he decided to create correspondence between them.William Henry Ireland, Confessions, p. 78. \"Doe notte esteeme me a sluggarde nor tardye for thus havyinge delayed to answerre or rather toe thank you for youre greate Bountye,\" he has Shakespeare write sans punctuation.  \"[G]ratitude is alle I have toe utter and that is tooe greate ande tooe sublyme a feeling for poore mortalls toe expresse O my Lord itte is a Budde which Bllossommes Bllooms butte never dyes.\" The Earl of Southampton replies in a similar vein, also sans punctuation, and with a similar spelling: \u201c\u2026as I have beene thye Freynde soe will I continue aughte thatte I canne doe forre thee praye commande me ande you shalle fynde mee Yours Southampton\u201d.Text from Samuel Ireland, Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments under the Hand and Seal of William Shakspeare, 1796. To explain how both letters could end up together in the same collection William Henry added a note explaining that Shakespeare\u2019s was a \u201cCopye\u201d of the letter he sent. Samuel Ireland and his friends admired the style of the letters but not the earl\u2019s penmanship; William Henry, not knowing that handwriting of the earl was extant, had written Southampton\u2019s reply with his left hand.Confessions, pp. 78\u201383.", "A flood of documents now followed, all coming from Mr. H\u2019s ostensibly-miraculous chest. Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cProfession of Faith\u201d proved he was a Protestant, a letter to fellow-actor Richard Cowley showed he was \"a perfect good natured man\",William Henry Ireland, Authentic Account, p. 15. and a letter from Queen Elizabeth made it clear that he was favoured by the most powerful person in the land. A sketch of himself that accompanied his letter to Cowley showed that he was a wretched draftsman with an impenetrable sense of humour. Described in the letter as a \"whysycalle conceyte\", it was (as Malone put it) \"most truly whimsical, being a miserable drawing of our poet done by himself with a pen, from Martin Droeshout's print of him engraved seven years after his death\u2026.\"Edmond Malone, An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Papers and Instruments Attributed to Shakespeare, p. 209. There were also theatrical receipts, contracts, a letter and poem to his future wife, \"Anna Hatherrewaye\", and even books from Shakespeare's library, complete with marginal annotations actually signed by the bard himself. Of most interest, however, were a manuscript of King Lear Shakespeare had prepared for the press, a few stray leaves of \"Hamblette\", and two previously unknown plays, Vortigern and Rowena and Henry II.", "One hitch developed when an alert visitor noted that a document supposedly written by the Earl of Leicester was dated 1590, whereas the nobleman had died in 1588.Kahan, Reforging Shakespeare, p. 86; Samuel Schoenbaum, Shakespeare's Lives, p. 206. When Samuel Ireland confronted his son with this information, William Henry wanted to burn the document, but his father demurred. He suggested that the document might have been misdated at some later time, and the two agreed to tear off the date.William Henry Ireland, A Full and Explanatory Account, MS, cited in Schoenbaum, op. cit. The item was displayed, and subsequently printed, in this mutilated form. At least two scholars, antiquary Joseph RitsonRitson to Paton, 21 July 1795 in The Letters of Joseph Ritson, volume 2, pp. 91\u201393. and classicist Richard Porson,Bernard Grebanier, The Great Shakespeare Forgery, p. 137. correctly recognised the documents as forgeries, and editor Henry Bate Dudley started lampooning the papers as early as 17 February 1795.Grebanier, p. 127, Schoenbaum, p. 212; Mair, p. 59.", "As early as 26 December 1794 William Henry had announced the existence of Shakespeare's unknown play Vortigern and Rowena, but it was not until March that he was able to present his father with the manuscript. It came with Shakespeare's correspondence with a printer purporting to explain why the play was unpublished.Kahan, pp. 62\u201366. Both Richard Brinsley Sheridan of Drury Lane Theatre and Thomas Harris of Covent Garden expressed an interest in producing the play. Sheridan was the winner in this competition. Prompted by fears that a descendant of Shakespeare might surface to claim the rights to his productions, William Henry produced a deed to prove that one of his ancestors, coincidentally named William Henry Ireland, had saved Shakespeare from drowning, and that Shakespeare had rewarded him with all the newly discovered manuscripts.William Henry Ireland, Authentic Account. pp. 22\u201323.", "The second blow came two days later, on 2 April, with the failure of Vortigern at Drury Lane Theatre. The excitement was intense and the crowd volatile; tickets had sold out early and seats were hard come by. While at first the play seemed to be a success with the audience, soon fits of laughter were heard and at one point the play came to a complete halt till order was restored. When Barrymore announced another performance of the play, the audience rebelled, and chaos reigned until the management substituted something else.Joseph Farington, diary entry for 2 April 1796, in the Farington Diary (London 1922\u201328), p. 145; James Anson Farrer, Literary Forgeries (London, 1907), pp. 226\u2013232. William Henry Ireland blamed the actors, particularly Kemble, along with a \"Malone faction,\" for the failure of his play.Confessions, pp. 156\u2013159. Others attributed it to the quality of the play itself.Farington, op. cit.; William P. Marsh, Clubs of London (London, 1828), volume 2, pp. 107\u2013111. Vortigern's opening night was also its final performance.", "Blaming Malone for his misfortunes, Samuel Ireland set out to write a book that would destroy the scholar's reputation. With the aid of Thomas Caldecott he attacked Malone for using forensic techniques like handwriting comparison to settle a literary question, rather than relying on taste and aesthetic sensibilities.DNB, p. 35; Samuel Ireland, Investigation; see especially 46\u201349. Concerned for his father's reputation William Henry rushed into print with a pamphlet confessing to the forgeries, and his father replied immediately with a vindication of his conduct in the whole affair.Hood, p. 422. William Henry Ireland says in the opening statement to the Authentic Account that his motive is \"to remove the odium under which my father labours\". This combination roused suspicions. George Steevens accused the two of collusion:The hopeful youth takes on himself the guilt of the entire forgery, and strains hard to exculpate his worthy father from the slightest participation in it. The father, on the contrary, declares that his son had not sufficient abilities for the execution of so difficult a task. Between them, in short, there is a pretended quarrel, that they may not look as if they were acting in concert on the present occasion.George Steevens to Bishop Percy, 26 December 1796, in John Bowyers Nichols, Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century (London, 1848), volume 7, pp. 7\u20138.The charge would stick. George Chalmers' Apology for the Believers and Samuel Ireland's Investigation concentrated on attacking Malone rather than exonerating Samuel, and the public verdict was probably summed up in a print by John Nixon depicting the entire Ireland family engaged in forging the papers.DNB, p. 35.
