He played in either a creative midfield role or full back position.\nA former Everton trainee, he started his career with Swindon Town in 1996. Two years later he was loaned out to Huddersfield Town, and transferred to Chester City. An impressive season won him a move to Port Vale, where he lifted the Football League Trophy in 2001. He left the club later that year to sign with Reading, where he remained for two years. He spent time on loan at Shrewsbury Town, but returned to Chester for their 2003\u201304 Conference National winning campaign. Following this he moved on to Wrexham, prior to a season with Southport in 2006\u201307.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["In order to help the Vale to avoid relegation at the end of the 1998\u201399 season, Horton brought in five players: Dave Brammer (Manchester City), Tony Butler (Blackpool), Carl Griffiths (Leyton Orient), Alex Smith (Chester City), and Chris Allen (Nottingham Forest). This spending spree set the club back \u00a3630,000, and so Horton first sold off Peter Beadle to Notts County for \u00a3250,000 in order to raise the cash needed for his new signings. He won his first game in charge, a 2\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town, thanks to a brace from Martin Foyle.
