Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote, \"The effect of Davis' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long ... Davis' own 'space music' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally.\" His recordings and performances during this period were described as \"space music\" by fans, Feather, and Buckmaster, who described it as \"a lot of mood changes\u2014heavy, dark, intense\u2014definitely space music\". The studio album On the Corner (1972) blended the influence of Stockhausen and Buckmaster with funk elements. Davis invited Buckmaster to New York City to oversee the writing and recording of the album with Macero. The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard jazz chart but peaked at No. 156 on the more heterogeneous Top 200 Albums chart. Davis felt that Columbia marketed it to the wrong audience. \"The music was meant to be heard by young black people, but they just treated it like any other jazz album and advertised it that way, pushed it on the jazz radio stations. Young black kids don't listen to those stations; they listen to R&B stations and some rock stations.\" In October 1972, he broke his ankles in a car crash. He took painkillers and cocaine to cope with the pain. Looking back at his career after the incident, he wrote, \"Everything started to blur.\""]}, {"page": "12 Monkeys", "response": ["The film's score was composed, arranged, and conducted by English musician Paul Buckmaster.

The album marked the beginning of Davis's \"electric period\", incorporating instruments such as the electric piano and guitar and jazz fusion styles. For his next studio album, Davis wished to explore his electronic and fusion style even further. While touring with his five-piece from the spring to August 1969, he introduced new pieces for his band to play, including early versions of what became \"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\", \"Sanctuary\", and \"Spanish Key\".
