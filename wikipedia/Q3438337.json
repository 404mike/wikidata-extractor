Due to these limits, a new infantry anti-tank weapon was needed, and this ultimately came in the form of the \"projector, infantry, anti-tank\" or PIAT. By 1942, the PIAT had been developed by Major Millis Jefferis. It was a combination of a HEAT warhead with a spigot mortar delivery system. While cumbersome, the weapon allowed British infantry to engage armour at range for the first time. The earlier magnetic hand-mines and grenades required them to approach dangerously near.Ian Hogg, Grenades and Mortars, Weapons Book #37, 1974, Ballantine Books During World War II the British referred to the Monroe effect as the \"cavity effect on explosives\".\"The Bazooka's Grandfather\".

The weapon fires a salvo of 24 bombs in an arc, aimed to land in a circular or elliptical area about  in diameter at a fixed point about  directly ahead of the attacking ship. The mounting initially was fixed, but was later replaced by a gyro-stabilised one to allow for the rolling and pitching of the attacking ship."]}, {"page": "Operation Royal Marine", "response": ["The mines were specially developed for the operation by Ministry of Defence 1 (MD1, Churchill's Toyshop), a British weapon research and development organisation. The mine, known as the 'W' Bomb, was designed by Millis Jefferis, who had received the request for the device on 10 November and had completed the first demonstration model by 24 November. A delayed-action fuze based on a soluble chemical pellet was devised by Jefferis' assistant, Stuart Macrae, using an Alka-Seltzer tablet, which was found to dissolve at a predictable rate. Each mine contained  of Trinitrotoluene (TNT). Trials of the mines were carried out in the Thames in December 1939 and depending upon type, either floated or bounced along the riverbed. Because Jefferis' department only consisted of three people at the point, the trials had to be conducted with the help of a boat crewed by local Sea Scouts, who followed the mines after they had been dropped from Chiswick Bridge. Over 20,000 'W' Bombs were produced in the course of the war."]}, {"page": "Blacker Bombard", "response": ["When the Second World War began, Blacker was a lieutenant-colonel in the Territorial Army. He had offered his Bombard to the War Office for two years without success but was introduced to the government department of Military Intelligence Research (MIRc)Macrae 1971, p 78 later known as MD1, which had been given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe.Hogg, p. 44 Blacker showed his list of ideas to the head of MD1, Major Millis Jefferis, who was taken with the design for the Bombard. He argued that it could serve in an anti-tank and artillery capability, and claimed that it would have similar anti-tank properties to the 2 pounder anti-tank gun coupled with approximately the same range as the 3-inch mortar.Mackenzie, p. 95 Objections were raised by the Director of Artillery and other government officials, but on 18 August 1940 the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, attended a demonstration of the weapon. Churchill took a liking to the weapon and ordered it into full production. It would act as a temporary anti-tank weapon for the Home Guard until more 2 pounders could be supplied to them."]}, {"page": "Sticky bomb", "response": ["Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives which added stability to the mixture and gave it a squash-head-like effect, where the explosive deformed and spread out on the target before exploding. The detonation would be concentrated on a small area, rupturing a thicker armour plate than a more diffuse explosion. The charge was covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin."]}, {"page": "Limpet mine", "response": ["In December 1938, a new unit was created in the British military that soon became known as Military Intelligence (Research), which is sometimes abbreviated as MI(R) or occasionally as MIR.

Instead of relying on the chemical action of a corrosive liquid on metal (which was subject to temperature variation), it used a piece of metal under stress - the metal in question being a lead alloy that was extremely affected by mechanical creep. A piece of this lead was notched to a set diameter, the diameter setting the time delay. When the starting pin was removed, this wire was placed under tension by the spring-loaded striker, and began to gradually stretch. After certain time it would snap at the notch and allow the striker to hit the percussion cap."]}, {"page": "Archibald Low", "response": ["*The 'W' bomb \u2013 a riverine mine for Operation Royal Marine being designed by MD1.
