He began his career at the age of 18 in 1944 when he joined the Army and spent time in India. On return to England, he went to Clare College, Cambridge in 1948 taking Botany and Geology at Part I. Although being tempted to take Geology for Part II, he decided to study Botany, for which he obtained First Class Honours and the Frank Smart Studentship. As a research student, he was supervised by Harry Godwin, Director of the Subdepartment of Quaternary Research and investigated the now classic study of the stratigraphy and palynology of the Middle Pleistocene interglacial lake deposits at Hoxne, Suffolk. He was awarded his PhD in 1954, shortly after he was elected a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. Richard become a lecturer in the Department of Botany in 1960, in 1966 he became Director of the Subdepartment, and Professor of Botany in 1977. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968 and was awarded many medals and prizes, including the Lyell and Bigsby medals of the Geological Society and the Albrecht Penck medal of the Deutsche Quart\u00e4rvereiningung. He retired in 1991.\nThroughout his career he has maintained a wide interest in Quaternary Science in general, and the British Quaternary geology in particular. His research has been mainly based on the understanding of interglacial and cold-climate period palaeobotany and stratigraphy, but also sedimentation and periglaciation. As well as inspiring three generations of research students, he published numerous reviews, over 120 papers and 9 books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Regius Professor of Botany (Cambridge)", "response": ["* Richard Gilbert West (1977)"]}, {"page": "Hoxne", "response": ["In 1797, John Frere (1740-1807) found flint hand tools twelve feet deep in Hoxne Brick Pit, and he was the first person to recognise ancient tools as being man-made. One of his hand axes is in the British Museum. His letter to the Society of Antiquaries, read on 22 June 1797 and published in the Society's journal Archaeologia in 1800, argued for the antiquity of these handaxes as \"even beyond the present world,\" in a period now recognised as belonging to the Lower Paleolithic Age.  Frere argued that these \"weapons\" were coincident with nearby extinct elephant fossils, in strata at the site of what is now known to be a Middle Pleistocene lake formed during the Great Interglacial geological warming period in Europe.  Accordingly, in Britain that entire period is called \"Hoxnian,\" signifying its identification there, based on evidence from undisturbed layers of pollens from plants and trees found at Frere's site in the 1950s (notably by Richard Gilbert West), which established the cycle of warming and cooling and defined the stages of the Great Interglacial.Chris Stringer, Homo Britannicus: The Incredible Story of Human Life in Britain (London: 2006) Teams headed by the University of Chicago made extensive excavations at Frere's site for five years between 1971 and 1978.Ronald Singer et al., The Lower Paleolithic Site at Hoxne, England (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993). They confirmed the date of the handaxes as ca 400,000 years BP, coincident with the Swanscombe finds, which, unlike the Hoxne, include human remains.  Subsequent research by the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain team has confirmed the presence of these ancestors of the Neanderthals as occurring towards the terminal, cooling phase of the Interglacial period, which, according to Chris Stringer, \"came to an end,...taking with it the lush river valleys, forests and grasslands on which the herds of horses and deer, and their hunters, relied.  Ice sheets returned...to the north-west of Europe...and a new pattern of episodic occupation was set in motion,\" lasting over three hundred thousand years.Stringer, Homo Britannicus, pp. 90f.
