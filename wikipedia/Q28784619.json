The departure of Irish goalkeeper Joe Murphy also meant Ricketts only had 1 senior goalkeeper. On 3 August, Ricketts managed to get 3 deals over the line, bringing in striker Rekeil Pyke from Huddersfield Town and promising Northern Irish winger Josh Daniels from Glenavon, as well as the loan signing of young midfielder Scott High, also from Huddersfield Town. The club played their first pre-season friendly of the season on 11 August, beating Cymru Premier side Bala Town 3\u20130 at Telford United's New Bucks Head. Two days later on 13 August, defender Omar Beckles rejected a new contract and subsequently also left the club, leaving a gap in Ricketts' defence. On 18 August, Ricketts won his second pre-season friendly of the season, defeating Nuneaton Borough 3\u20131 at home. This was followed by a defeat 0\u20131 home defeat to rivals Walsall on 21 August, a 5\u20131 defeat away at Stoke City on 25 August and a 1\u20130 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers U23, also on 25 August. On 28 August, Ricketts managed to strengthen his defence with the loan signing of United States U20 international Marlon Fossey from Fulham. The club's final pre-season friendly took place on 29 August, a 2\u20131 win away at Premier League club Burnley.

He released 13 players at the end of the 2016\u201317 season. His first summer signing was former two-time Player of the Year Tom Pope on a free transfer after he managed to secure his release from Bury. He went on to sign ten more players during the window: goalkeepers Rob Lainton and Sam Hornby, defenders Joe Davis, Antony Kay, Gavin Gunning, Lawrie Wilson and Graham Kelly, midfielders Michael Tonge, Cristian Monta\u00f1o, David Worrall and Harry Middleton, and striker Tyrone Barnett; he also signed youngsters Rekeil Pyke, Marcus Harness, Tyler Denton, Ben Whitfield, Jack Stobbs and Tom Anderson on loan. However Vale suffered their worst start to a season in 50 years at the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, going a club record six games without scoring a goal as they sat bottom of the table in September following six consecutive league defeats. He was sacked on 16 September following a 1\u20131 home draw with second-from-bottom Forest Green Rovers. Speaking after his sacking, Brown said that it had been difficult for him to recruit quality players on \"a very tight budget... I think it was arguably \u00a31m under from when they had got promoted from that league the time previously\".

On 30 January, Chris Regis became the third Academy player to leave the club in order to seek first-team football, while Rekeil Pyke joined the U's from Huddersfield Town on loan until the end of the season. Colchester completed two deadline day transfer deals on 31 January. The arrival of goalkeeper Dean Brill following his release from Motherwell would provide competition for Sam Walker and would allow Dillon Barnes to head out on loan, in response to the surprise retirement of James Bransgrove in December. Then, after having his contract terminated by Swindon Town earlier in the day, midfielder Sean Murray joined the U's on a one-and-a-half year deal.", "The U's suffered their first home defeat since November on 14 February after Crawley Town won 3\u20132 at the Community Stadium. Denny Johnstone scored his second goal for the club to give the hosts an 18th-minute lead, but a hat-trick from Jimmy Smith put Colchester 3\u20131 down by the 51st-minute. A late consolation goal from Brennan Dickenson reduced the deficit, while both Charley Edge and Rekeil Pyke made their professional debuts from the bench as the club slipped to 10th in the league table.

He signed 19-year old Huddersfield Town striker Rekeil Pyke on a season-long loan. As last season's captain Ben Purkiss rejected a new contract offer, Brown signed right-back Lawrie Wilson on a free transfer from Bolton Wanderers to replace him. Having decided against signing one of the wingers on trial, Brown instead brought in Burton Albion's Marcus Harness on a season-long loan. On the same day that Barnett was revealed to have suffered a serious hamstring tear, the club announced that trialist centre-back Gavin Gunning had signed a contract of undisclosed-length. The day before the opening game of the season, Brown secured veteran trialist midfielder Michael Tonge to a one-year deal, and also brought in 21-year old winger Ben Whitfield on a half-season loan from A.F.C.

Earlier in the day he made his second signing as manager, bringing in striker Dior Angus from non-league Redditch United. Meanwhile, Gavin Gunning left the club on the expiry of his contract, whilst Jack Stobbs, Rekeil Pyke and Tyler Denton returned to their parent clubs. In contrast, Whitfield's loan was extended until the end of the season. Gunning made his debut for Forest Green on 6 January, and kept a clean sheet as Rovers beat the Vale 1\u20130 with a goal from fellow d\u00e9butante Reuben Reid; Aspin apologized to supporters after the match for the team's performance. Aspin went on to allow Lawrie Wilson to join National League side Ebbsfleet United after the full-back failed to make the first-team under his tenure. He also agreed to terminate the contract of French midfielder Anthony de Freitas, whilst bringing in striker Donovan Wilson on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vale put in a poor performance at home to Yeovil, though did claim a 1\u20131 draw after Pope converted a late penalty. Aspin went on to sign midfielder Luke Hannant from Gateshead for an undisclosed fee, having previously signed the 24-year old from Team Northumbria in 2016. He also boosted the defensive numbers by bringing in centre-back Zak Jules on loan from Shrewsbury Town. Hannant made his debut at Accrington Stanley on 20 January, a game in which Vale led 2\u20130 at half-time only to lose 3\u20132; Aspin went on to criticise both the referee for failing to spot a handball for Accrington's equaliser and also his team for poor defending. Jules made his debut and Lainton returned to the starting eleven for the visit of Colchester on 27 January, and Vale managed to secure a 2\u20132 draw despite a poor performance thanks to a brace from Worrall. A surprise departure was then announced, as Anderson was recalled early from his loan spell by Burnley. Aspin responded quickly by signing former youth-team centre-back Charlie Raglan on loan from Oxford United, 21-year old defender Kyle Howkins on loan from West Bromwich Albion and 23-year old defender Callum Howe for an undisclosed fee from Lincoln City.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||22||align=\"left\"| Rekeil Pyke", "| 11 July 2017 || CF ||  || Rekeil Pyke || Huddersfield Town || 2 January 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 11 July 2017 || CF ||  || Rekeil Pyke || Port Vale || 31 May 2018 || "]}, {"page": "Rekeil Leshaun Pyke", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rekeil Pyke"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Rochdale A.F.C. season", "response": ["|30||Rekeil Pyke||CF||||Leeds||||1||0||Huddersfield Town||30 January 2019||Loan||2019", "| 30 January 2019 || CF ||  || Rekeil Pyke || Huddersfield Town || 31 May 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=left|  Rekeil Pyke", "|align=left|  Rekeil Pyke", "|align=left|  Rekeil Pyke"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 3 July 2019 || CF ||  || Rekeil Pyke ||  Rochdale || 5 January 2020 || Under-23s || ", "|align=\"left\"|25||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Rekeil Pyke"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Rochdale A.F.C. season", "response": ["|11||||LW||Rekeil Pyke                                      ||1||0||1||1||3", "|11||||LW||Rekeil Pyke                                       ||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||0", "| 3 July 2019 || CF ||  || Rekeil Pyke ||  Huddersfield Town || 30 June 2020 || "]}]}}
