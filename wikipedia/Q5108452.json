Nelson started strongly for Hartlepool and scored the winner from 30 yards during his debut in Hartlepool's 4\u20133 win over Peterborough. This goal almost earned him another award as it was on the shortlist for Hartlepool's Goal of the Season. He was also voted September's Player of the Month on the official Hartlepool website. Nelson began to form a strong partnership with Chris Westwood and the pair played together for the majority of Hartlepool's games. Nelson went on to play in 40 of Hartlepool's league matches and played in both legs of Hartlepool's play-off semi-final match against Bristol City. Nelson was in contention for Hartlepool's Fans and Players' Player of the season but he missed out to Jim Provett on both occasions."]}, {"page": "Jude Kuring", "response": ["In 1981, she and Chris Westwood formed a women's subgroup in the APG. The two had been discussing the lack of women's roles in Australian theater, often relegated to the stereotypical \"hooker with a heart of gold\", or as a mother, and began organizing members at Nimrod Theatre. They were also given a $110,000 Limited Life Project grant from the Theatre Board of the Australian Council, which they used for a variety of projects including two sets of play readings, a series of acting workshops and included hosting a seminar on women, comedy and music.Watson, Sophie.
