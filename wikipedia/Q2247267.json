They worked to establish that plants could be reliably identified and were able to publish their findings together. Their first book was published in 1899, The Origin of the British Flora, which focused on paleobotany. He mentioned that she helped in gathering nearly 100 samples from deposit near West Wittering. It was the two of them who were credited with establishing that \"floras could be reliably reconstructed from sources rich in fossil fruiting organs\". Their second book, The Fossil Flora of Tegelen-sur-Meuse, near Venloo, in the Province of Limburg was published in 1907 and is focused on paleobotany, as well as the Pleistocene geological timescale. The last book they published together was in 1915\u2014a year before the death of her husband Clement Reid\u2014 titled, The Pliocene Floras of the Dutch-Prussian Border, which targets the topics of both paleobotany as well as the Pliocene geological timescale."]}, {"page": "C.Reid", "response": ["#REDIRECTClement Reid"]}, {"page": "Reid's paradox of rapid plant migration", "response": ["Reid's Paradox is named after Clement Reid, a paleobotanist, who made the principle observations from the paleobotanical record in Europe in 1899. His comparison of oak tree seed dispersal rates, and the observed range of oak trees from the fossil record, did not concur. Reid hypothesized that diffusion was not a possible explanation for the observed paradox, and supplemented his hypothesis by noting that birds were the likely cause of long range seed dispersal. Reid's Paradox has been subsequently documented across Europe and North America."]}]}}
