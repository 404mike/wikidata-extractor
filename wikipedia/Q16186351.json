He invited two convicted bombers, Linda Quigley and Gerry MacLochlainn, to the House of Commons in 1984, from which the Party Leader Neil Kinnock \"did everything in his power\" to disassociate himself. MacLochlainn met with Labour's front bench in 1994, as part of a delegation. A meeting with Gerry Adams in 1996 was cancelled following pressure from Tony Blair. Corbyn responded by saying \"dialogue with all parties remains essential if the peace process is to continue\". He has been strongly criticised by Labour and Conservative MPs for holding meetings with former members of the PIRA in the Palace of Westminster, to discuss topics such as conditions in Northern Irish prisons and the PIRA ceasefire.The Glasgow Herald, p. 17, 17 December 1984 At Trafalgar Square marches opposing British troops' placement in Northern Ireland, Corbyn urged (prior to the Bloody Sunday Inquiry) for the British government to officially condemn Bloody Sunday and issue an inquiry into the massacre. When Corbyn stopped the march and addressed the crowd using a bullhorn, police officers warned Corbyn against the move due to the contentious nature of the march."]}]}}
