He was named as the club's captain, a position he had previously held at both Stevenage and Fleetwood Town. Roberts made his debut for Cambridge on the opening day of the 2015\u201316 season, playing the full 90 minutes as Cambridge defeated Newport County 3\u20130 at the Abbey Stadium. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20132 draw at York City on 3 October 2015, scoring from close range as Cambridge fought back from two goals down to earn a point. A week later, Roberts was sent-off for violent conduct in Cambridge's 3\u20131 home defeat to Portsmouth. He was a regular starter for Cambridge up until the end of January 2016, when he was dropped ahead of an away match at Leyton Orient. He was subsequently replaced as captain by Luke Berry, with manager Shaun Derry stating \"I've spoken to Mark and he's accepted it as a man. He'll respond in the right way because he's a leader of men\". He made 34 appearances for Cambridge in his first season with the club, scoring twice."]}, {"page": "Mitch Rose", "response": ["On 20 January 2017, Rose agreed a free transfer to League Two side Newport County until the end of season. He made his debut for Newport on 28 January 2017 in a 3\u20131 home win versus Hartlepool United. Rose was sent off in the 3\u20132 away defeat at Cambridge United on 18 February 2017, for what seemed to be a foul on Luke Berry in the box in stoppage time; Rose, annoyed at the decision, knocked the card out of referee Trevor Kettle's hand. Joe Day saved George Maris' spot kick, but Mark Roberts bundled home the rebound. Rose faced an automatic one-match ban, but two days later this was overturned on appeal. Rose was later handed a five-match ban and charged by the FA with misconduct; he was also fined \u00a31,000 and Newport were fined \u00a32,500 for failing to control one of their players."]}]}}
