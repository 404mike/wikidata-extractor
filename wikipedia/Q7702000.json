The work contains many of Bolt's favourite themes of integrity and honour \u2013 as well as Brechtian devices which fit naturally within the story's fantasy setting. The show was commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company for a showing at Christmastime, 1964. Among the original cast were John Normington as Fitz-Oblong, Michael Jayston as the play's narrator, Bolt perennial Leo McKern as the title character, and Terence Rigby and a young Malcolm McDowell in supporting roles. A revival in the late 1960s featured Roy Kinnear as Fitz-Oblong. Paul Scofield provided a voice recording for the dragon. Like A Man for All Seasons, the play had been written for the BBC, and in 1995 was re-written into a children's book. The play was extremely popular, and throughout the 1960s/70s, it had a yearly revival at Christmas in Britain. In the early 60s, the Augsburger Puppenkiste puppet theatre produced the play for German television in six sequels titled Der kleine dicke Ritter.", "* State of Revolution (1977) \u2013 An in-depth political depiction of the Russian Revolution of 1917, focusing on Vladimir Lenin as \"a great man possessed by a terrible idea\", and the struggles of Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin to gain power under him. It is told from the point of view of Lunacharsky, Lenin's Minister of Education. The original cast included Michael Bryant as Lenin, Terence Rigby as Stalin, Brian Blessed as Maxim Gorky, and Michael Kitchen as Trotsky. Though meticulously researched, the play received mixed reviews and had a short run before being shelved. Bolt himself felt that he had not written the play as well as he might have done."]}, {"page": "2003 in film", "response": ["| Mona Lisa Smile || Columbia Pictures / Revolution Studios / Red OM Films || Mike Newell (director); Lawrence Konner, Mark Rosenthal (screenplay); Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Ginnifer Goodwin, Dominic West, Juliet Stevenson, Marcia Gay Harden, John Slattery, Marian Seldes, Laura Allen, Tori Amos, Emily Bauer, Jordan Bridges, Lisa Roberts Gillan, Topher Grace, Annika Marks, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Lily Rabe, Terence Rigby, Krysten Ritter || Drama || || Live Action"]}, {"page": "1998 in film", "response": ["| Elizabeth || Gramercy Pictures / PolyGram Filmed Entertainment / Working Title Films / Film4 Productions || Shekhar Kapur (director); Michael Hirst (screenplay); Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston, Joseph Fiennes, John Gielgud, Richard Attenborough, Kenny Doughty, Kathy Burke, Fanny Ardant, Vincent Cassel, Emily Mortimer, Daniel Craig, Eric Cantona, Kelly Macdonald, James Frain, Edward Hardwicke, Jamie Foreman, Terence Rigby, Angus Deayton, Amanda Ryan, Kenny Doughty, Wayne Sleep, Alfie Allen, Lily Allen, George Yiasoumi || Biography, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| The Dogs of War || United Artists || John Irvin (director); Gary DeVore, George Malko (screenplay); Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Colin Blakely, Hugh Millais, Paul Freeman, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois St\u00e9venin, JoBeth Williams, Maggie Scott, Robert Urquhart, Winston Ntshona, Pedro Armend\u00e1riz Jr., Harlan Cary Poe, Ed O'Neill, Shane Rimmer, George Harris, David Schofield, Terence Rigby, Olu Jacobs, Alan Beckwith, Jim Broadbent || War || Live action"]}, {"page": "Get Carter", "response": ["* Terence Rigby as Gerald Fletcher, one of the London crime boss brothers.
