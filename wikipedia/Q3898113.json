He enjoyed loan spells with Blackpool, Port Vale, and Aberdeen; before transferring to Walsall for the 2010\u201311 season. After leaving Walsall he signed with Rochdale and then non-league Droylsden. He re-joined Port Vale on non-contract terms in February 2012, before signing with FC Halifax Town five months later. He signed with Stockport County in February 2013, before returning to Halifax Town later in the year. He signed with Bradford Park Avenue in May 2015, and then Alfreton Town in October 2016 and Curzon Ashton in May 2017. He joined Buxton in July 2019 and then moved on to Mossley later in the year. He joined Radcliffe in July 2021 and moved on to Workington two months later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["His team exited the three cup competitions at the First Round in 2011\u201312, and after losing to non-league Grimsby Town in the FA Cup in a run of five games without a win \u2013 which included 388 minutes without scoring a goal \u2013 he signed Guy Madjo, Jennison Myrie-Williams and Shane O'Connor on loan. These proved to be inspired signings, as a Madjo hat-trick meant that the two Stevenage loanees scored a total of five goals between them in their first three games. However, in December he admitted that the club's off-the-field issues were a cause of concern for him and that he was being \"kept very much in the dark.\" Nominated for the Manager of the Month award for three wins in four December games, Adams revealed that due to the club's precarious financial position he was unable to sign any new players or even retain his loan players in the January transfer window \u2013 despite the chairman having previously told him to draw up a list of transfer targets. He did though manage to sign Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall on non-contract terms. He would also have signed Chris Birchall, however before the deal was finalised the Football League placed the club under a transfer embargo after a tax bill went unpaid. The club were unable to pay the player's wages in February. The club entered administration on 9 March, ending what had been a genuine push for promotion; talks between the administrator and Adams did not seem constructive, as Adams told the press that he was \"taking legal advice\". However, he stayed put, and steered the \"Valiants\" to a 12th-place finish; they would have been only 3 points off the play-offs had the club not entered administration. In May, he was linked with the vacant management position at Gillingham, with his friendship with \"Gills\" chairman Paul Scally cited in his favour in media reports."]}, {"page": "Dean Smith (footballer, born 1971)", "response": ["He let fourteen players go in summer 2011, including: Darren Byfield, Jonny Brain, Clayton McDonald, Paul Marshall, Matt Richards, Steve Jones, Aaron Lescott, David Bevan, Julian Gray, and Tom Williams. He then signed goalkeeper D\u00e1vid Gr\u00f3f; defenders Mat Sadler and Lee Beevers; midfielders Kevan Hurst, Claude Gnakpa, Adam Chambers, and Anton Peterlin; and striker Ryan Jarvis. Also during the campaign he boosted his squad with loan signings Dave Martin, Mark Wilson, Andy Halliday, and Florent Cuvelier. His side lost just one of their first five league games, but then picked up just three points from their next seven games. They beat Preston North End on 15 October, but then picked up just four points from their next eight games. From 26 November, they were beaten just once in nine matches, but became the division's draw specialists as seven of these nine games finished level.

Glover accepted he was not the popular choice to take over from Sinnott and described himself as a \"dead man walking\". Many fans, we well as local journalists and pundits questioned Glover's tactical decisions, team selection and managerial abilities in general. Some fans even started booing his son in an attempt to 'get to' Glover himself. Glover attempted to arrest his team's slide down the table by signing Carlisle United striker Kevin Gall on loan. He failed to score in seven games with the club, and returned to Carlisle after picking up a calf injury.

He made his second appearance at senior level on 17 March, when he replaced Paul Marshall 49 minutes into a 3\u20132 defeat away to Crawley Town; manager Micky Adams put him on as centre-back Clayton McDonald had just been sent off. McDonald's subsequent suspension gave Davis the opportunity to start against Hereford United three days later, Adams saying \"he'll either sink or swim\". He was voted man of the match after he produced \"a disciplined defensive display beyond his tender years\". However, he was sent off 69 minutes into the next match for a professional foul on Torquay United's Rene Howe; the penalty kick was converted to cost Vale a 2\u20131 away defeat.

Vale suffered four consecutive defeats, before managing to turn things around by the end of the month with 1\u20130 wins over Rotherham United and Plymouth Argyle. On 14 February, midfielders Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall joined the club on non-contract terms. However the treatment room grew more busy, as Adam Yates and Tom Pope picked up injuries requiring several weeks of rest. The club expected to receive a boost when Trinidad and Tobago international Chris Birchall returned from the Los Angeles Galaxy to play for the club on a month-by-month basis; however the club were hit by a transfer embargo by the Football League on 25 February for failing to pay a bill. Nevertheless performances on the pitch were solid, and Vale entered the Crewe derby having won four and drawn one of their last five games. The derby finished honours even again at 1\u20131, with a late header from Byron Moore cancelling out the own goal scored by Crewe skipper David Artell. A 2\u20131 home defeat by Barnet on 10 March ended Vale's run of eight game unbeaten; combined with a ten-point deduction for entering administration, the club slipped from 9th to 14th in the space of 24 hours. Promising young defender Lee Collins was the first the leave the club post-administration, joining Championship side Barnsley on a loan deal worth \u00a350,000 to the Vale on 15 March. The drama continued in the game against Shrewsbury Town on 27 March, as the match was abandoned after 64 minutes due to a fire caused by the failure of the floodlights at the New Meadow. With the season drawing to a close, Adams began developing his squad for the following season, and announced that he had 'reluctantly' released defender Charlie Raglan, without giving him his first team debut. He offered contracts to all but three players: Chris Martin, Phil Roe, and Paul Marshall; he also placed Burge on the transfer list. Aside from Lee Collins, the first player to reject a contract with Vale to move elsewhere was Anthony Griffith, who signed a two-year deal with League One side Leyton Orient. The first out-of-contract players to pledge their futures to Port Vale were Rob Taylor (two years), Lewis Haldane (six months), Ben Williamson (one year), and Sam Johnson (one year). Days later it was announced that Sean Rigg had signed with Oxford United, whilst Clayton McDonald confirmed that he would accept Vale's offer of a new one-year deal. However the biggest blow to fan's hopes of promotion came when it was announced that talismanic top-scorer Marc Richards had signed a two-year deal with relegated League One side Chesterfield. June began with John McCombe and Tom Pope both agreeing to sign new deals with the club. The only player to reject the club's offer of a new contract despite not signing a contract elsewhere was goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson; he eventually ended up at Burton Albion.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||14||align=\"left\"| Paul Marshall", "|29||||MF||Paul Marshall||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0", "|||Paul Marshall", "|||Paul Marshall"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Rochdale A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Paul Marshall"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Walsall F.C. season", "response": ["| Paul Marshall"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 New Zealand Football Championship", "response": ["|  Paul Marshall", "| Paul Marshall"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["|Paul Marshall"]}]}}
