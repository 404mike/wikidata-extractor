Commissioned in 1880, Doran saw service on the staff and with the Royal Irish Regiment through a number of colonial campaigns in the late nineteenth century, culminating in command of a mobile column in the Boer War, where he was seriously wounded. He then commanded a battalion of his regiment, followed by a brigade in the British Expeditionary Force. His brigade was mobilised in 1914, and he saw service during the first months of the First World War before being dismissed in October. He was later reinstated as commander of a brigade in the New Armies, and promoted to the 25th Division before it was sent to France in 1915; he led it on the Western Front until June 1916, when he was relieved and sent home. From 1916 to 1918 he commanded the Army forces in southern Ireland, and then held an administrative post in France before retiring in 1920.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doran", "response": ["* Beauchamp Doran (1860\u20131943), British Army officer during the First World War", "**John Desmond Beauchamp Doran (1912\u20131946), British army intelligence officer"]}, {"page": "Irish military diaspora", "response": ["* Major-General Beauchamp Doran"]}, {"page": "25th Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["The component units of the division were assembled around Salisbury and moved to Aldershot in May 1915 to complete their training.

The infantry thought that the Germans were going to attack but air reconnaissance found no signs of preparations. In the weeks before the German attack, the weather was so bad that reconnaissance flights over the ridge by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) had been possible on only ten days. Aircraft observers saw several new light railways, a supply dump and at one place new assembly trenches were observed. The last reconnaissance before the German attack was flown on 17 May; the crew flew over the German trenches from  but found that it was too dark to see into them. British military intelligence took the view that the Germans lacked the infantry and artillery necessary for an attack and the transfer of divisions from the First, Second and Third armies to reinforce the Fourth Army continued."]}]}}
