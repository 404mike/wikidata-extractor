In March 1891, during a revolt in the eastern Indian State of Manipur, James Wallace Quinton, the resident Frank Grimwood and other British officers were murdered, while others were imprisoned. Lieutenant CJW Grant of the Madras Staff Corps with a detachment of eighty Punjabi and Gurkha soldiers was stationed at the border post of Tamu, some 55 miles from Manipur. On hearing about the incident on 28 March, he immediately marched with his detachment for relief of the survivors. On 31 March, he arrived at Thoubal about 15 miles from Imphal and immediately attacked and captured the village. He then proceeded to entrench his force. Next day, the Manipuris advanced towards Thoubal in force. Without waiting for the enemy to attack, Lieutenant Grant with forty men went out to meet them and forming up, opened fire. For the next nine days, the intrepid young officer and his gallant men repulsed repeated attacks. Always keeping the initiative, and surprising the Manipuris with sallies, he inflicted heavy casualties and thoroughly demoralized them. Several offers of truce and safe passage were spurned by him. On 9 April, he received orders to withdraw towards a British force, which was then advancing towards Manipur. Eighty men had defied the entire army of a state for more than a week, losing just one man killed and four wounded, including Lieutenant Grant. The lieutenant and his men joined the relieving force and took further part in fighting during which he was again wounded. The British entered Imphal (Kangla) on 26 April, bringing an end to the war. For his conspicuous bravery, inspirational leadership and devotion to duty, Lieutenant Charles Grant was awarded the Victoria Cross.Ahmad 2006, pp. 62\u201365."]}, {"page": "University Philosophical Society", "response": ["* James Wallace Quinton, chief commissioner of Assam from 1889 until his murder by rebels in Manipur in 1891.

Neither Ethel or her husband could speak the local language although Frank persevered with lessons.

However Surchandra appealed to the Viceroy of India, Lord Lansdowne, who dispatched 400 Gurkhas under the inexperienced James Wallace Quinton to arrest the conspirators."]}]}}
