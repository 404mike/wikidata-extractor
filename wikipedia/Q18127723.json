In the first half of the season he played a key part, mainly as an impact player from the bench, in the team's good form which seen them unbeaten for the first 16 games of the season, however the team's form soon dipped around Christmas and Arnold then found himself on the sidelines for periods until the end of the season. It was a compliment to the squad overall that the likes of Arnold and Delano Sam-Yorke amongst others found themselves on the sub's bench on many occasions. He did however play a key role in getting Cambridge United to the FA Trophy final by scoring the winner in the first round against Salisbury City and also against St. Albans City in the second round. He then made an appearance in every game of the cup run including a 20-minute appearance at Wembley Stadium for the final where Cambridge United beat Gosport Borough 4\u20130 to lift the trophy, and also contributed to them finishing the season in 2nd place and a play-off spot.
