Bridges was a friend of Caldwell and a fellow Freemason, and moved to protect him by ordering Wong's potentially incriminating account books to be destroyed.. An initial inquiry acquitted Caldwell and Bridges in 1858; Governor John Bowring recommended Bridges' advancement within the administration, tipping him as a future Attorney General.. The controversy surrounding the Caldwell affair continued, however, and after Bowring's departure in 1859 his successor as governor, Hercules Robinson, reopened the case and commenced a new inquiry in 1860, which recommended Caldwell's dismissal.
