He came through the youth ranks at Tranmere Rovers during the 1992\u201393 season. Coyne eventually went on to become the club's first choice keeper and went on to make 111 appearances in the league before signing for Grimsby Town in the summer of 1999. He spent four seasons at Blundell Park, two of which saw him named \"Supporters Player of the Season\" and thus becoming an integral part of the every Grimsby team he played in. In his final year at Town the club suffered relegation from the Football League First Division. In July 2003 Coyne signed with Premier League side Leicester City where he was understudy to Ian Walker for one season before moving to Burnley. Initially signed as the first club's new first choice keeper he eventually was replaced by Brian Jensen, and only made 40 league appearances in a three-year stay at Turf Moor. In 2007, he returned to Tranmere Rovers for two years where he made a further 80 league appearances before joining Middlesbrough in 2009 who had recently suffered relegation from the Premier League. Coyne went on to make 26 league appearances in a three-year stay at Boro where he was mainly used as reserve keeper. During the 2012\u201313 campaign he joined Sheffield United but failed to make an appearance and departed at the end of the season.\nBetween 1996 and 2007 Coyne picked up 16 international caps for Wales.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 27", "response": ["*1973 \u2013 Danny Coyne, Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["*  Danny Coyne (3 Caps, 31 March 2001)"]}, {"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["The sudden collapse of ITV Digital had left the club with debts of over \u00a32\u00a0million, \u00a3700,000 of which was owed to the Inland Revenue and a further substantial amount to their bankers, Lloyds Bank.
