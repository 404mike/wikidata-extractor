He played youth football for the club in the 1970s before a knee injury ended his career prematurely. He also played football for England at schoolboy level.Merry was part of Woodstock Partners Limited (or WPL), a consortium  headed up by Ian Lenagan that bought the club for \u00a31 from former chairman Firoz Kassam.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford United F.C.", "response": ["On 21 March 2006, Firoz Kassam sold the club, including its debts, for approximately \u00a32 million to Florida-based businessman Nick Merry, who had played for United's youth team in the mid-1970s. Merry immediately made changes to the club, including the hiring of former manager Jim Smith in his second spell. Despite signing five new players on his first day in charge, Smith was unable to prevent relegation at the end of the 2005\u201306 season. After 44 years in English league football, Oxford were relegated to the Conference National after finishing in 23rd place, becoming the first former winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the league. Coincidentally, Accrington Stanley, the club whose bankruptcy in 1962 allowed United to be elected into the League, was one of the two clubs promoted to replace them.Brodetsky p.50.", "On 2 October 2008, Nick Merry stepped down as chairman to be replaced by Kelvin Thomas, who had been part of the management team at the time of Merry's takeover. Just under two months later, Patterson was sacked after a poor run of form, and was replaced by former Halifax Town manager Chris Wilder.  Following Wilder's arrival, the team won 15 of the remaining 21 league matches that season. A 5-point deduction for fielding an unregistered player resulted in a seventh-place finish, four points and two places short of the play-offs."]}, {"page": "Kassam Stadium", "response": ["At the 2008 Annual General Meeting, club chairman Nick Merry said \"The price is agreed for the stadium at \u00a313 million. That is not negotiable but the valuation of the stadium is some way short of that so funding that deficit needs to make commercial sense. We are not prepared to put the future of Oxford United at risk. Any deal has to make sense for both the short term and long term future of this club.\" "]}, {"page": "Darren Patterson", "response": ["After retiring from the game Patterson remained at Oxford as youth team coach. He served as caretaker manager of the club following the departure of Graham Rix, although he was ultimately overlooked for the job in favour of Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz.Managerial stats  He was finally appointed manager of the club on a full-time basis in March 2006 following the departure of Brian Talbot. However, no sooner had Patterson been appointed than he lost the job to Jim Smith following the sale of the club by Firoz Kassam to Nick Merry.'Patterson targets return to winning ways' Patterson managed the club for only eight days, and in doing so became perhaps the shortest-serving manager in the history of the English league. While Bill Lambton and Tim Ward both had periods in charge of a club that lasted three and seven days respectively, but neither man actually signed a contract to manage the club, whereas Patterson did.  Leroy Rosenior later managed an even shorter stint at Torquay United in 2007, being fired only 10 minutes after signing his contract, but Torquay were no longer a League club by that point."]}, {"page": "Ian Lenagan", "response": ["Lenagan is a huge rugby league fan. His successful business ventures have allowed him to become involved in the sport and in July 2005 he took over as chairman and majority shareholder of Harlequins RL, buying 65% of the shares and also taking a place on the board of directors. He also became a major shareholder in Oxford United, who were controlled by long-time friend Nick Merry. In July 2012 he replaced Kelvin Thomas as chairman of the League Two club. Lenagan sold his interest in Oxford United and left the board in 2016 when he was appointed Chairman of the Football League."]}, {"page": "Gary Twigg", "response": ["Twigg signed a two-year contract with Conference National side Oxford United on 5 July 2007. Nick Merry, Oxford United chairman, said, \"He's got a good record and he's very versatile too. He can play wide or down the middle and he'll be a good asset to us.\" He came on as a substitute on the opening day of the 2007\u201308 season at home against Forest Green Rovers in which he won and scored a stoppage time penalty to win the game for Oxford on his debut. An ankle injury that required surgery in October led to him missing seven weeks of the season before he returned to the side in December. However, he was unable to settle and left at the end of December to seek a move back to Scotland. He had made 11 league and cup appearances, scoring three goals."]}]}}
