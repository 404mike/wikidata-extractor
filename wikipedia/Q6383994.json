In 1938, at the age of six, he moved to Rhyl.. He studied art at Newcastle and for a short time taught art at Preston Catholic College before going on to lecture in art at both Manchester and Liverpool Colleges of Art. He was closely associated with other artists of the area and the era including the Pop artist Neville Weston and the conceptual artist Keith Arnatt. In 1972 he won a major prize for his painting Meat Painting II \u2013 In Memoriam Rene Magritte in the John Moores competition. He was president of the Merseyside Arts Association and Liverpool Academy of the Arts in the 1970s and was an honorary professor of the city's John Moores University. Henri had a 10-year relationship with Carol Ann Duffy, who later became Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. The pair met when she was 16 and lived together until 1982. Henri married once, to Joyce; the couple later separated. He had no children. For the last 15 years of his life his partner was Catherine Marcangeli. His career spanned everything from artist and poet to teacher, rock-and-roll performer, playwright and librettist. He could name among his friends John Lennon, George Melly, Allen Ginsberg, Willy Russell, John Willett and Paul McCartney. Unlike McGough and Patten, Henri turned his back on the trendier London scene, and chose to remain in Liverpool, saying there was nowhere he loved better."]}, {"page": "Liverpool Biennial", "response": ["Artists who were part of The Unexpected Guest included Doug Aitken with David Adjaye, John Akomfrah, Hurvin Anderson, Janine Antoni, Keith Arnatt, Kader Attia, Yael Bartana, Sylvie Blocher, Andrea Bowers, Sophie Calle, Rhys Chatham, Libia Castro and \u00d3lafur \u00d3lafsson, Enrico David, Eugenio Dittborn, Elmgreen and Dragset, Peter Fischli & David Weiss , FormContent, Dora Garcia, Gilbert and George, Simryn Gill, Mona Hatoum, Fritz Haeg, Oded Hirsch, Thomas Hirschhorn, Nadia Kaabi Linke, Markus Kahre, William Kentridge, Anja Kirschner and David Panos, Jakob Kolding, Jiri Kovanda, Suzanne Lacy, Runo Lagomarsino, Jorge Macchi, Dane Mitchell, Sabelo Mlangeni, Mark Morrisroe, Patrick Murphy, Ahmet \u00d6g\u00fct, Field Operations, Trevor Paglen, Christodoulos Panayiotou, Martin Parr, Pedro Reyes, Rhizome, Pamela Rosenkranz, George Shaw, Pak Sheung Chuen, Patrick Waterhouse, Mikhael Subotzky, Superflex, Sinta Tantra, Althea Thauberger, Mark Titchner, Jeanne van Heeswijk, Mark Wallinger, Jemima Wyman, Ming Wong, Kohei Yoshiyuki and Akram Zaatari"]}, {"page": "Paul Graham (photographer)", "response": ["* Troubled Land; within The New British Document (also with Keith Arnatt, John Davies, Peter Fraser and Martin Parr, curated by Sally Eauclaire), Museum of Contemporary Photography, Columbia College Chicago, May\u2013June 1986.Leaflet accompanying the exhibition, MoCP.

It is this dialogue with the elements that distinguishes Herring from earlier experiments with chance, of the kind done by Dada and Surrealist artists.  The intimate scale of the art work also marks Herring from Land Art done in the US. Photography was used to document the work, a method Herring used up until 1970.  This date marks a shift away from the seduction of visual imagery towards work based on words, ideas and acts. The artist's interest lay particularly in communication, in coding and decoding.  He was close to Keith Arnatt and Terry Atkinson in terms of politics of art as well as friendship.  All his work questions the r\u00f4le of art and art galleries as well as the relationship of the art work to its audience. Some of his work is now in the Tate Britain Museum, London.", "Herring's subsequent works concentrate on encodings, decodings and meta-language, but the elements of chance and process are still present.  In 1970 Herring exhibited in Idea Structures with Keith Arnatt, Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Victor Burgin, Harold Hurrell and Joseph Kosuth at the Camden Arts Centre.  His work, Proposition, consisted of a small filing cabinet measuring 16 x 20 x 39\u00a0cm (a single drawer of card files).  Inside were some 400 cards, most of which were blank.  During the weeks prior to the exhibition Herring had asked 50 people to keep one card in their possession for a week, at the end of which the used card was collected by the artist.  A new card was then given to each person, replacing the used one. The process was repeated seven times, thus yielding a total of 400 cards, minus a number of cards that were accidentally lost.  The artist then selected 8 of the used cards, one card from each week's collection, and had the centre of the card micro-graphed (a photographic process that records the microscopic detail of the subject, in this case the actual fibres of the paper card).  The micro-graphs were then inserted at regular intervals in the body of 400 blank cards."]}, {"page": "Barbara Steveni", "response": ["This was realised in 1971 with the exhibition Art and Economics. Steveni set up the first placement secured by the organisation between Garth Evans and the British Steel Corporation in 1969. Other artists who had important placements with APG included Keith Arnatt, Ian Breakwell, Stuart Brisley, George Levantis and David Hall. In the 1980s, feeling that the notion of the artist placement had been appropriated and diluted by many arts and academic organisations, Steveni and Latham changed the name of APG to O+I or Organisation & Imagination."]}]}}
