Swedberg notes that, typically, all-women films differ from mixed porn (with men and women) in, among other things, the settings (less anonymous and more intimate) and the very acts performed (more realistic and emotionally involved, and with a focus on the whole body rather than just the genitals): \"the subject of the heterosexually produced all-women videos is female pleasure\". She argues (against Laura Mulvey's \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cineman\" and Susanne Kappeler's Pornography and Representation, for example) that such movies allow for female subjectivity since the women are more than just objects of exchange. Appropriation by women of male-made lesbian erotica (such as by David Hamilton) was signaled also by Tee Corinne."]}, {"page": "Susanne Kapeller", "response": ["#REDIRECT Susanne Kappeler"]}, {"page": "Kappeler", "response": ["*Susanne Kappeler (born 1949), British academic"]}]}}
