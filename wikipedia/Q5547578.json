She is portrayed as a girl who often takes advantage of her friends namely Dede Baxter and Kit Karter, for talents and takes credit for them. She realises about her wrongdoings and her friends stick by her. Sadie has a sibling played by Danny Jenkins, and her parent played by Steve Jenkins, with her dog played by Roger and a mechanical apprentice (Keith) with whom she shares a household. All of these are male people, hence, her habits are those of a boy and there is no girl role model for her to look up to apart from Cheryl Cole who she calls 'Chezza'. This is the reason why some of her fashion tastes are so boyish, she has such bad manners and is better than her brother and his best friend at football.
