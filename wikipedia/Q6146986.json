Harrison is a right-handed batsman who bowls left-arm medium-fast.  He was born at Whiston, Merseyside, and was educated at Sedbergh School.\nHaving previously been part of Durham's cricket academy, Harrison made his debut for Durham in a List A match against Somerset in the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40 at the Riverside Ground, Chester-le-Street.  He ended Durham's innings of 222/9 on 7 not out, while with the ball he took the wickets of Craig Kieswetter and Peter Trego, finishing the match with figures of 2/51 from eight overs.  Following the match, he made his first-class debut against the same opponents at the County Ground, Taunton, in the County Championship.  Durham batted first and made 384 all out, with Harrison dismissed by Trego for 15 runs.  Somerset responded in their first-innings with 400 all out, with Harrison taking figures of 4/112, returning the best figures of any Durham bowler in the innings.  Durham were then dismissed for 167 in their second-innings, with Harrison dismissed by George Dockrell for 20.  Requiring 152 for victory in their second-innings, Somerset reached 152/5 to win by 5 wickets, with Harrison taking a single wicket during the chase, that of Alex Barrow, to finish with innings figures of 1/19 from five overs, and match figures of 5/131.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whiston, Merseyside", "response": ["*Jamie Harrison, cricketer "]}, {"page": "Sedbergh School", "response": ["*Jamie Harrison, cricketer"]}, {"page": "James Harrison", "response": ["* Jamie Harrison (born 1990), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Durham County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Jamie Harrison (2012\u20132015) : J.
