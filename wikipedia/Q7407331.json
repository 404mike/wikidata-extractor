He played as a centre back in the Football League for Huddersfield Town, Bury, Port Vale, Hull City, Swindon Town and Hartlepool United, and managed in the Football League with Hartlepool United.\nCollins started his career with Huddersfield Town in 1994 before he transferred to Bury in 1999. After three years he moved on to Port Vale, where he established himself as captain. He was named as the club's Player of the Year at the end of the 2002\u201303 season. Collins' performances earned him a move to Hull City in 2006, though a series of knee injuries blighted his time at the club. Loaned to Swindon Town for a brief spell in 2007, the following year he signed permanently with Hartlepool United.\nCollins took on a coaching role with Hartlepool in 2014 and had three spells as caretaker manager before leaving the club in 2017. He spent a year as a coach at Bradford City before becoming youth-team manager at York City. He took over as manager in August 2018, initially as caretaker manager, before leaving in January 2019.

He left the club on 13 November."]}, {"page": "Andy Morrison", "response": ["Morrison was signed by Brian Horton for Huddersfield Town in the 1996\u201397 season. Horton used the \u00a32.7 million that Sheffield Wednesday had used to purchase Andy Booth from Huddersfield, to invest in Morrison as well as Marcus Stewart from Bristol Rovers and Andy Payton from Barnsley. Horton, like Allardyce before him, also made Morrison captain. Morrison scored in his debut for Huddersfield against Charlton (which Huddersfield won 2\u20130). Morrison's Huddersfield teammate Ben Thornley described him as 'the hardest person to have ever played football'. Morrison won the respect of fans 'with his braveheart style warrior performances'. A knee injury restricted Morrison's appearances for Huddersfield in the 1996\u201397 season. He was replaced by Sam Collins in a 1\u20130 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in September 1996 and did not play for Huddersfield again until a 0\u20130 draw with Manchester City in November 1996, in which he was replaced by Kevin Gray just after half time. He did not play again until April 1997 when he replaced David Beresford, at half time, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Charlton Athletic. In the 1997\u201398 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 3\u20130 defeat to West Ham United in the League Cup, in which John Hartson scored a hat trick. He also played in Huddersfield's 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon, in the FA Cup, in which Neal Ardley scored the only goal. Huddersfield's poor results in the league that season (they went nine games without a win) led to Horton being sacked. Horton was replaced by Peter Jackson, who managed to keep the team up. Morrison played in Huddersfield's first victory that season, a 3\u20131 win against Stoke City (in which Lee Richardson, Stewart and Paul Dalton scored Huddersfield's goals). He also played in Huddersfield's second win of the season, a 1\u20130 victory against Manchester City at Maine Road, in which Rob Edwards scored the winner. In the 1998\u201399 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 2\u20131 defeat to Everton, in the League Cup, in which Olivier Dacourt and Marco Materazzi scored Everton's goals and Stewart scored Huddersfield's goal. Morrison fell out with Jackson early that season when the latter decided to make Barry Horne Huddersfield captain, leading to Morrison's departure."]}]}}
