While Figgins' types were influential in design, the types themselves were little used by the late nineteenth century, as larger metal types had largely been displaced in use by pantograph-engraved wood-type, being much lighter and easier to handle, although the company continued to hold the matrices into the 1950s.", "By the late nineteenth century it was clear that for large-run printing of body text the future was hot metal typesetting, which cast fresh new type for each printing job, and in the case of the Linotype machine cast each line in rigid blocks.

The styles of Figgins' work also became less popular around the beginning of the twentieth century, with new Art Nouveau-influenced display type designs and greater interest in the styles of earlier centuries.
