Academics Simon Avery and Rebecca Stott consider the biography to interrogate the picture of Barrett Browning that was mainstream at the time of its publication, presenting \"a far more active and intellectual woman than the myths had previously allowed for\". The academic Deborah Byrd describes Forster's accounts of Barrett Browning's relationships with each of her parents as \"illuminating\", and praises her \"for reminding us that the poet was as capable of creating complex fictions about her own life as she was of constructing interesting narratives about imaginary characters.\" The academic Deirdre David describes the book as \"an exemplary biography, eminently readable and packed with fascinating detail\", which takes a \"fair-minded, never sensational approach\", and praises the moving way that Forster handles the love story between the Brownings. The academic Glennis Stephenson considers that mainstream critical opinion had already moved away from the passive victim view of Barrett Browning's character that Forster challenges. She praises the book for its lively depiction of Barrett Browning's childhood and its insight into a \"fussy, self-important\" side of the poet. Byrd and Stephenson also praise the way the biography highlights how far Barrett Browning fell short of her own ideals of compassion and sisterhood in her treatment of her female servants."]}, {"page": "2017 in literature", "response": ["*Rebecca Stott \u2013 In the Days of Rain: a daughter, a father, a cult (June 1, UK)"]}, {"page": "List of people named Rebecca", "response": ["*Rebecca Stott (born 1964)"]}, {"page": "2017 Costa Book Awards", "response": ["* Winner: In the Days of Rain by Rebecca Stott"]}, {"page": "Audie Award for Literary Fiction or Classics", "response": ["| The Coral Thief (2009) by Rebecca Stott"]}]}}
