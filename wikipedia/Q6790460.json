He was a trader, farmer, Indian Department official, political, fur trader, and militia officer during and after the era of the American Revolution.:\u200a301\u200a He held a key position in Anglo-Indian affairs during the time period.:\u200a55\u200aElliott came to America in 1761 and settled in Pennsylvania during the French and Indian War. As a trader in western Pennsylvania and Ohio in the 1760s and 1770s, and as a captain in the British Indian Department during the Revolution, he had lived and fought among the tribes of the Northwest, particularly the Shawnee. He was married to a Shawnee woman and spoke the language fluently, his sympathies with the Indians. With the Shawnee woman, Elliott had two sons named Alexander and Matthew.:\u200a55\u200a He later married Sarah Donovan and they had another two sons, Francis Gore and Robert Herriot Barclay.:\u200a303\u200aIn 1778 Elliott, along with Alexander McKee and Simon Girty fled to Detroit.  He served as a scout on Henry Hamilton's expedition to Vincennes in the autumn of 1778 but left before Hamilton was captured by the Americans in February 1779.  For the remainder of the Revolution Elliott served as a British Indian agent.:\u200a93\u200aAfter the Revolution, Elliott established himself on a farm at what became Amherstburg, Ontario in Upper Canada.  He eventually owned over 4,000 acres and numerous slaves, a number of whom he had acquired in the course of raids during the Revolution and refused to relinquish despite government pressure.:\u200a370\u200a Elliott is mentioned as a slave owner whose slaves were particularly fearful of. He had installed a lashing ring to a tree in front of his house to instill fear in his slaves; which instead encouraged many to try to escape. In partnership with William Caldwell, he renewed his trading activities, dealing with the Indians of Lake Erie, bringing provisions from Pittsburgh to sell to them as well as in Detroit. Business became so difficult to maintain in such a disputed area, that his company went bankrupt in 1787.:\u200a302\u200a Despite this, and the fact that Elliott was illiterate, he became a justice of the peace for the new District of Hesse in 1788.:\u200a302\u200a He went on to become superintendent at Amherstburg in 1796, but had been dismissed two years later in 1798 after a dispute over the irregularities in the issuing of provisions.:\u200a55\u201356\u200aIn 1790, Elliott became assistant to McKee, who was Indian superintendent at Detroit while Elliott continued to encourage the Shawnee and other native groups to oppose American advance across the Ohio River. With McKee, Elliott helped organize the different tribes to resist occupancy and land cessions. Elliott went on to become \"superintendent of Indians and of Indian Affairs for the District of Detroit\" in the summer of 1796, but by December 1797 he was dismissed.:\u200a108\u200a During the next ten years he tried significantly to gain reinstatement, travelling to England in 1804 and even gaining the support of fellow politicians.  None of this worked, though from 1800 to 1804, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada.  He was also re-elected in 1804 and 1808, though at these dates he attended meetings less frequently due to other business.:\u200a303\u200aWhen British-American relations went sour again in 1807, the great importance of Elliott's influence among the Indians was recognized and in 1808 he was reappointed superintendent in place of Thomas McKee.:\u200a303\u200a By the fall of 1808 it became apparent that the Indians were preparing for war, and the British did not want to be blamed.  Elliott worked closely with Tecumseh for an alliance. Before the War of 1812, Elliott had succeeded in gaining the Indian alliance with natives in American territory as well as British.:\u200a59\u200aDuring the last few months of his life, Elliott led Indian raids on the Niagara frontier. He died from illness in 1814 in the Burlington area of Ontario.:\u200a303\u200a", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Blue Licks", "response": ["In July 1782 a meeting took place at the Shawnee villages near the headwaters of the Mad River in the Ohio Country, with Shawnees, Delawares, Mingos, Wyandots, Miamis, Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Potawatomis in attendance. As a result, 150 British rangers under Captain William Caldwell (of Butler's Rangers) and some 1,100 Indian warriors supervised by Pennsylvania Loyalists Alexander McKee, Simon Girty, and Matthew Elliott set out to attack Wheeling, on the upper Ohio River. This was one of the largest forces sent against American settlements during the war."]}, {"page": "Battle of Beaver Dams", "response": ["The loss of Boerstler's detachment demoralized the U.S. force at Fort George. From then until they abandoned the fort on 10 December, they rarely dared send any patrols more than a mile from the fort. To reinforce their fear of the Native people, there was another minor disaster on 8 July when a party from the 8th (King's) Regiment and Merritt's Troop of Provincial Dragoons, accompanied by Ottawas under Captain Matthew Elliott and other Indigenous warriors under Mohawk chief John Norton, went to retrieve a chest of medicines which had been hastily buried at Ball's Farm near Two Mile Creek when the British had evacuated Fort George in May. A U.S. party from the 13th U.S. Infantry under Lieutenant Joseph Eldridge attempted to pursue the British detachment but was ambushed, losing 28 men, several of whom were scalped despite the efforts of officers of the Indian Department to prevent it.Stanley, George F.G.

This would involve the entire frontier and this was the turning point that would allow the seductive promises of Elliot and McKee to succeed in turning Simon. On March 28, 1778, Alexander McKee (Scots-Irish Loyalist), Matthew Elliott, and Simon Girty all defected on the same night. Along with them was Robert Surphlit (McKee's cousin), a man named Higgins (an employee), and two of McKee's black slaves. Seven men left McKee's house in Pittsburgh, and absconded west into the Ohio country, and towards the British stronghold in Detroit. A few hours later, a party of American soldiers arrived at the house to take McKee to the Pittsburgh prison."]}, {"page": "Siege of Fort Meigs", "response": ["After the battle, the prisoners from Dudley's command were taken for confinement to the ruined Fort Miami near the British camp. Here, some of the Native warriors began massacring the prisoners and several Americans were killed before Tecumseh, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Elliott and Captain Thomas McKee of the Indian Department persuaded the warriors to stop.Antal, p. 226 Tecumseh is reputed to have asked Procter why he had not stopped the massacre and, when Procter replied that the Indians could not be made to obey, replied, \"Begone! You are unfit to command. Go and put on petticoats\". Another version of the incident had Tecumseh rebuking Procter with, \"I conquer to save; you to kill\".Sugden, p. 337 Eye-witness accounts stated that between 12 and 14 prisoners were killed in the massacre.Sugden, p. 335"]}, {"page": "List of slave owners", "response": ["* Matthew Elliott (\u20131814), a Loyalist, he captured slaves during the American Revolution and kept them on his farm in Upper Canada in defiance of government pressure."]}, {"page": "3rd Parliament of Upper Canada", "response": ["|Matthew Elliott"]}, {"page": "4th Parliament of Upper Canada", "response": ["|Matthew Elliott"]}, {"page": "5th Parliament of Upper Canada", "response": ["|Matthew Elliott"]}, {"page": "Matthew Elliott", "response": ["* Matthew Elliott (cricketer) (born 1971), Australian Test cricketer", "* Matthew Elliott (loyalist) (1739\u20131814), British agent in the American Revolution and War of 1812", "* Matthew Elliott (political strategist) (born 1978), British political strategist and lobbyist", "* Matthew Elliott (rugby league) (born 1964), Australian rugby league footballer and coach"]}, {"page": "Nancy (1789 ship)", "response": ["Nancy was in MacIntosh's wharf at Moy (Windsor) when the War of 1812 broke out between the United States and Great Britain. Moved for protection to Amherstburg, the ship was taken by the commander of the British garrison, Lieutenant-Colonel St George, as a transport vessel. Before the war, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Elliott of The Indian Department had surveyed Nancy as part of an inventory of the means available in case of war. According to Elliott, Nancy could mount six  carriage guns and six swivel guns. The schooner was apparently armed with some  guns. Most of these were dismounted from the schooner and used to arm several small gunboats patrolling the Detroit River. At some later date, Nancy received two  guns and two  carronades."]}, {"page": "Battle of Fort Recovery", "response": ["The combined Native American force had only suffered 3 killed in the coordinated ambush, but Odawa and Ojibwa forces attacked the fort directly.  A party of British officers under Captain Matthew Elliott argued against the attack, since they had already inflicted great damage on the Legion but had little chance of success against the fort.  The attack was quickly neutralized by defenders from within the safety of the fort, including infantry, dragoons, and Chickasaw scouts.  Captain Gibson also brought up the recovered artillery to defend the fort.  The cannons did not seem to have a significant direct effect on the confederate force, but caused some warriors to flee.  The confederate force refused to retreat, however, forcing the fort to remain closed while a British artillery crew searched for the cannon's buried after St. Clair's defeat in 1791.  Blue Jacket had no choice but to support the futile attack, which lasted until nightfall."]}, {"page": "Winamac", "response": ["After the siege of Fort Wayne, Winamac served as a scout under British Indian agent Matthew Elliott.

In command at Detroit was Major Arent Schuyler DePeyster, responsible to Sir Frederick Haldimand, the Governor General of British North America. DePeyster used agents such as Girty, Alexander McKee, and Matthew Elliott, who all had close relations with Natives, to coordinate British and Native military actions in the Ohio County. In a council at Detroit on May 15, DePeyster and McKee told a gathering of Natives about the Sandusky expedition and advised them to \"be ready to meet them in a great body and repulse them.\" McKee was sent to the Shawnee villages in the Great Miami River valley to recruit warriors to repel the American invasion. Captain William Caldwell was dispatched to Sandusky with a company of mounted Butler's Rangers, as well as a number of Natives from the Detroit area led by Matthew Elliott. The Natives from the Detroit area, described as \"Lake Indians\" by the British, included the \"Three Fires Confederacy\" as well as northern Wyandots.", "The skirmish became a full-scale battle by 4:00\u00a0p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Lenapes out of the woods and onto the prairie, the Lenapes were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. British agent Matthew Elliott may have been present, coordinating Lenape and Wyandot actions. Pipe's Lenapes skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Natives crept close to the American lines in the tall prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get a better shot at them. Gunsmoke filled the air, making it difficult to see. After three and a half hours of incessant firing, the Natives gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms at the ready, and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.", "On June 11, about one hundred men, women, and children gathered near Pipe's Town to witness Crawford's execution. Dunquat and a few Wyandots were present, as well as Matthew Elliott. Crawford was stripped naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied from his hands to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit about six or seven yards (6 m) from the pole. Native men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty replied that he could not interfere. After about two hours to four hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned."]}, {"page": "William Caldwell (ranger)", "response": ["After the war, Caldwell settled in the Detroit region that became Upper Canada.

Major engagements involving the Indian Department on this front included Captain Bird's Invasion of Kentucky, Crawford's Defeat, and the Battle of Blue Licks. The British Indian Department was particularly successful mobilizing warriors against the Americans in the Ohio Country following the massacre at Gnadenhutten of 96 pacifist Christian Munsees by Pennsylvania militiamen on March 8, 1782.", "The Indian Department again played an important part in the War of 1812, mobilizing warriors to defeat the United States in a number of important battles from Montreal to the Mississippi River. The Indian Department was particularly important in supporting the revival movement led by Tenskwatawa, the Shawnee Prophet, and his brother Tecumseh. Indeed, many members of the Department, like George Ironside Sr. and Matthew Elliott, had family connections to the Shawnee. Other prominent members of the Department during the War of 1812 include Joseph Brant's son, John Brant, Joseph Brant's adopted heir, John Norton, and Sir Willian Johnson's grandson, William Claus."]}]}}
