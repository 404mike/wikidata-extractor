The side was composed of players familiar with each other and the success was a reward for such longstanding legends as Charlie Church and Bert Cromar. Cromar played in every league game, as did goalkeeper Frank Crampsey (brother of journalist and Queen's fan Bob), who kept 17 clean sheets. Queen's only lasted two seasons in the top Division and were relegated in 1958, having only won four league games all season, and losing heavily on many occasions."]}, {"page": "Charles Church", "response": ["* Charlie Church (1929\u20132010), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Jocky Robertson", "response": ["At a height of , Robertson was extremely short for a goalkeeper, but was able to command the penalty area due to his ability to judge when to jump for the ball and his reliability in catching.
