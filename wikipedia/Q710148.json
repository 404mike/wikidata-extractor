He worked with former world champions Richard Burns and Colin McRae as a gravel note expert while co-driving for both David Higgins and Mark Higgins in the British national series. His big break, however, came when he teamed up with the emerging Estonian talent Markko M\u00e4rtin as a privateer pairing in a Toyota Corolla WRC for the 2000 World Rally Championship season.\nAfter a number of strong performances, the pair were signed up by Subaru for 2001, before moving to Ford, where they evolved into one of the leading driver/co-driver combinations in the WRC. In 2003, they took two rally victories, in Greece and Finland, and improved on that figure with three wins in 2004 (Mexico, Corsica and Catalunya).\nPark died as a result of injuries sustained in an accident on the final leg of Wales Rally Great Britain when his Peugeot 307 WRC left the road and struck a tree. M\u00e4rtin and Park were lying fourth in the 2005 season's title race at the time, after securing four podiums in a season dominated by Citro\u00ebn's S\u00e9bastien Loeb. Their performances had been instrumental in Peugeot's challenge for the manufacturer's championship, with the team lying six points behind French rivals Citro\u00ebn.\nAfter the crash, M\u00e4rtin said \"Park wasn't my co-driver, I was his pilot.\" Park's death was the first top-level rallying fatality since Rodger Freeth in the 1993 Rally Australia, and brought renewed attention to safety issues in the motorsport world.\nOn 20 June 2006, a memorial for Park was unveiled in Tallinn, Estonia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 22", "response": ["*1966 \u2013 Michael Park, English racing driver (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "September 18", "response": ["*2005 \u2013 Michael Park, English racing driver (b. 1966)"]}, {"page": "1966", "response": ["** Michael Park, British rally co-driver (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "Petter Solberg", "response": ["He added an unwanted Wales Rally GB win after the death in a day three crash of fellow competitor Markko M\u00e4rtin's co-driver, Michael Park, with Loeb sacrificing his victory on the road in order to avoid having to simultaneously celebrate the title.
