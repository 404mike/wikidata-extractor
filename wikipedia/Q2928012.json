He was an association footballer before he left home at sixteen to enrol as a naval engineering student at HMS Marlborough in Portsmouth. It was there he was converted into a rugby player.

Wales lost the game but Taylor would play in the remaining two games of the campaign against Scotland and Ireland. In 1884 Taylor was reselected for Wales, in a team that would host several past and future captains, including Arthur Gould, Tom Clapp, Frank Hancock and Newman.

This was the first time Wales had beaten England and the result gave Wales a chance of taking the tournament title when they face Ireland two weeks later. The Welsh were unable to take advantage of their England win, when they drew, with a goal apiece, at Lansdowne Road. Wales were heading towards defeat before a late Charlie Thomas try gave Wales an equaliser. More notable was the fight between the two sides at the after-match dinner, in which nine players found themselves in Dublin Court the next day.

At the time Biggs was 18 years and 49 days old, making him the youngest Wales international, a record that would last for more than a century before being broken by Tom Prydie in 2010.Griffiths (1987), p. 4:5. The New Zealanders were the first touring team from the Southern Hemisphere and brought with them a reputation for over-vigorous play. Biggs himself was described by the press as \"palpably nervous\" before the kick-off, though many of the backs appeared withdrawn, apart from William Stadden and James Webb appearing calm.Billot (1972), p.17 Not only did Biggs have the M\u0101ori opposition to contend with, the Swansea crowd were also hostile towards their own team, as they felt the Swansea backs should have been selected instead. Biggs, as an inexperienced new cap from rivals Cardiff, was picked out by the crowd as one of those players unworthy of his place and was heckled. Nonetheless, the Welsh team were victorious, with tries from Thomas, Towers and Hannan and a single conversion from Webb. A week later on 29 December, Biggs faced the same tourists, this time as part of the Cardiff team. Biggs had been disappointing in his international debut, but regained his form on the pitch at the Cardiff Arms Park.Billot (1972), p 21 Within 90 seconds of the start of the match, Biggs scored a \"sparkling try\".

Wales had never beaten the English, but the England team had missed the last two seasons after an argument with the Scottish Rugby Union and this was their first Championship game of the tournament.

The England game was an historic victory, which saw Wales beat their old adversary for the first time, thanks to a single try from William Stadden. Thomas didn't play in the final game of the tournament, his place taken by London Welsh's Rowley Thomas. Thomas played one final game for Wales, the final game of the 1891 Championship which saw the selectors shake up the Welsh pack, bringing in four new caps and Thomas in replacement for William Bowen.

On this occasion, Evans was partnered with new cap George Bowen of Swansea, the Welsh captaincy going to Bob Gould.

Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, Mathews was brought into the team at halfback, replacing captain Charlie Newman, and partnered with William Stadden of Cardiff. The game was an important match in the history of rugby, as it was the first international to see the use of the four three-quarter system, brought in by Frank Hancock. The game did not go well for Wales and the three-quarter system was abandoned mid-match, which caused further confusion, resulting in a simple Scottish victory.
