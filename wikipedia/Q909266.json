In 1840 he began, at Blaydon, near Newcastle, to remove the impurities, consisting chiefly of antimony, from \"hard\" lead, and thus to convert it into \"soft\" lead, by means of a current of air driven over the molten metal; the impurities were oxidised, floated to the surface, and were then skimmed off. Practical improvements introduced into the process by George Burnett soon after led to the annual importation of several thousand tons of Spanish hard lead into the Tyne district, where it was purified. John Percy brought forward evidence that Richardson was not the inventor of this process, quoting a letter from James Leathart, and stating that a patent for it was granted to Walter Hall in 1814."]}, {"page": "Friedrich Ludwig Knapp", "response": ["* John Percy, Metallurgy, translator (1862)"]}, {"page": "Hilary Bauerman", "response": ["In 1874 Bauerman first acted as an examiner of the science and art department.
