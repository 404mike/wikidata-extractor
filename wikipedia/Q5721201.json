Although Jones kept his own lodgings at Barnard's Inn, the two men saw each other daily until Butler's death in 1902, collaborating on music and writing projects in the daytime, and attending concerts and theatres in the evenings; they also frequently toured Italy and other favourite parts of Europe together. After Butler's death, Jones edited Butler's notebooks for publication and published his own biography of Butler in 1919.", "Another significant friendship was with Hans Rudolf Faesch, a Swiss student who stayed with them in London for two years, improving his English, before departing for Singapore.

He maintained friendships with a number of significant individuals, including Siegfried Sassoon, the novelist Forrest Reid and the uranian poet and librarian Charles Sayle. He was editor, with Henry Festing Jones, of the works of Samuel Butler (published 1923\u20136) and collected material for a biography of Frederick Rolfe.", "Bartholomew left behind him not only his considerable contributions to the life of the University Library, but also his literary research, of which the most significant were his involvement in editing the works of the Victorian novelist Samuel Butler (novelist), and the gathering together of material on the life and work of Frederick Rolfe).  His work on Butler began in 1910, when he heard a paper on his life by Henry Festing Jones. The two soon became friends, a relationship which culminated in Bartholomew's work on The Shrewsbury edition of the works of Samuel Butler, published in twenty volumes between 1923 and 1926. At Festing Jones' death in 1928, Butler's literary executorship passed to Bartholomew. His work on Frederick Rolfe had a somewhat less happy ending. In 1918 he set about gathering material for a possible biography of the eccentric author, who had died in Venice in 1913. He compiled a scrapbook of material from various sources, including Rolfe's publisher Grant Richards, the uranian poet Horatio Brown (who had lived in Venice for much of his life) and Rolfe's family. But A. J. A. Symons, founder of the First Edition Club, published a piece on Rolfe in 1926 which focused on the more scandalous aspects of his life, and for reasons which are unknown, Bartholomew eventually gave up on his projected biography. At Bartholomew's death his precious scrapbook (now at the Harry Ransom Center in Texas) was lent to Symons, who used it extensively for his 1934 biography of Rolfe, entitled Quest for Corvo."]}, {"page": "James Tait Black Memorial Prize", "response": ["| 1919 || Hugh Walpole, The Secret City || Henry Festing Jones, Samuel Butler, Author of Erewhon (1835\u20131902) \u2013 A Memoir (Samuel Butler) || "]}]}}
