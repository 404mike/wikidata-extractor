Prior moved to Derby in 1998 but did not settle there, though did manage to score the winner in a game against Sheffield Wednesday. A number of clubs showed an interest in him before Manchester City signed him shortly before the transfer deadline in the 1999\u201300 season. City had signed him to replace the injured Andy Morrison as they had only been able to field two central defenders (Gerard Wiekens and Richard Jobson) for most of the season. His impact on the team was immediate, his goals earning City numerous victories and ultimately promotion. As City arrived in the Premiership Prior found his first team opportunities limited as the then City manager, Joe Royle, bought Steve Howey, Richard Dunne and Paul Ritchie, while Andy Morrison also returned from his lengthy injury."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Dundee United F.C. season", "response": ["United started the league campaign with a 2\u20131 loss to Falkirk at home on the opening day of the season and then drew at Rangers, despite being 2\u20130 ahead.

David Proctor finally arrived from Inverness CT to end weeks of protracted negotiations. Successive 0\u20130 draws against Kilmarnock (where Lee Miller's only start was marred by an early sending-off) and Dunfermline were improved by an extra-time CIS Cup win over Airdrie United and a 3\u20131 win at newly promoted St Mirren, where captain Barry Robson's 100th United match was event-filled, with two goals and a sending-off. The transfer window brought no new faces but striker Lee Miller was surprisingly allowed to leave for Aberdeen on a free transfer, although it later transpired he had been disciplined days earlier for breaking club regulations.
