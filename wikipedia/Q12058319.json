Most elections were unanimous, and the newly elected mayor was instantly regarded as the head of the council. The system changed with the introduction of The Municipal Corporations Acts Amendment Act, 1875, as that legislation stipulated that mayors had to be elected at large (i.e. by eligible voters). Fred Hobbs, the incumbent, was the only candidate nominated, so he was declared elected unopposed on 17 December 1875. James Gapes was the first mayor elected at large on 20 December 1876. The newly elected person was from that point the mayor-elect, until he was sworn in; Gapes was sworn in on 2 January 1877. Despite this, Taylor's death in 1911 resulted in councillors electing their fellow councillor John Joseph Dougall as mayor as required by the legislation for such cases.", "* James Gapes", "| James Gapes", "| James Gapes"]}, {"page": "1882 in New Zealand", "response": ["*Mayor of Christchurch \u2013 James Gapes followed by George Ruddenklau"]}, {"page": "1881 in New Zealand", "response": ["*Mayor of Christchurch \u2013 Charles Thomas Ick followed by James Gapes"]}, {"page": "1878 in New Zealand", "response": ["*Mayor of Christchurch \u2013 James Gapes followed by Henry Thomson"]}, {"page": "1877 in New Zealand", "response": ["*Mayor of Christchurch \u2013 Fred Hobbs followed by James Gapes"]}, {"page": "Charles Hulbert (mayor)", "response": ["Hulbert first stood for election as Christchurch city councillor in September 1879 in the South East Ward on the Ratepayers' Association ticket. The South East Ward was located south of Hereford and east of Colombo Streets; it was the first time that the ward system was used in an election. The Ratepayers' Association intended to support three candidates in each of the four wards, i.e. a candidate for each available position. Of those 12 possible candidates, 11 were eventually nominated, and 9 of them were elected, including Hulbert.

Dougall initially deputised as mayor after Taylor's death and at the next council meeting on 31 July 1911, he was unanimously elected the next mayor by his fellow city councillors. Many of them lamented the antiquated legislation which did not allow for an election at large in case of the death of the incumbent mayor. Since the December 1876 election when James Gapes was returned, mayors had been elected at large. Dougall was succeeded as a city councillor by Henry Acland."]}, {"page": "William Wilson (mayor)", "response": ["Wilson stood for election to the city council once more in 1878, i.e. after his fraud conviction. At the candidates' meeting, Wilson argued with the current mayor, Henry Thomson, who acted as chairperson at the meeting, about the order of proceedings. Three positions were available contested by eight candidates, and James Gapes, Wilson, and Aaron Ayers were returned. Over the next day, five of the existing councillors handed in their resignation in protest over Wilson's election: William Pratt, William Radcliffe, George Ruddenklau, James Jameson, and Alexander William Bickerton. Radcliffe tried to withdraw his resignation, but this was not accepted by the mayor. Five new councillors were elected in a by-election the next month. Councillors were elected for one year at the time, and Wilson retired at the September 1879 election, when he did not stand again."]}]}}
