The most hotly anticipated bout going into the second GB Championships was in the flyweight division between Welshman Andrew Selby and Khalid Yafai of England. After both boxers had got past the quarter-final stage of 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Baku one month previous, it meant they would have to box off for a place at the 2012 Summer Olympics if neither boxer took gold in Azerbaijan, and Selby missed that achievement by the narrowest of margins in the final, losing 13:12. The pair met on 11 November for the first of a scheduled three fights to decide which boxer would secure Olympic qualification, with Selby recording a convincing 26:12 victory. On 12 November it was reported that Yafai had pulled out of their next encounter because he couldn't make the weight, thus granting the Welshman Olympic qualification and denying Yafai of a second Olympic Games. In other bouts, Warren Baister claimed gold with an impressive win in the 91\u00a0kg final. Salisbury ABC's Sam Maxwell earned a hard-fought 16:14 win over Wales' Joe Cordina who had beaten tournament favorite Iain Weaver the previous day. Another Liverpool boxer, Anthony Fowler beat Kieran Smith 15:9, and his conqueror of last year's championships, Callum Smith won at the 75\u00a0kg division.
