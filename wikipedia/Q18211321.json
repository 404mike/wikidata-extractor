In March in their second Menton title defense attempt Kehrling and Worm lost in the semis to Tamino Abe and Aeschlimann when the title-holders were already serving for the match.

In Beaulieu Worm and his recurring mixed partner Satterthwaite was unable to defend their title and ceded it to Pat Hughes and Violet Owen.
