He was also the first Englishman to race in the Polish League for Gdansk. He raced for Diedenbergen in the German League for ten seasons, winning four German titles, where he was consistently the top performer. He qualified for 16 consecutive British Final appearances, his best finish being second to the late Kenny Carter; this was when England ruled The Speedway World.In 1975, after 3 years at Oxford, he was caught up in the wrangle over whether Ole Olsen would ride for Oxford, and was in the strange position of guesting for himself in a couple of matches at the start of the season. Eventually, the Speedway Control Board ruled that Olsen would stay with Wolverhampton Wolves, Dag Lovaas would ride at Oxford, and John could join Reading Racers.\nAfter the end of his speedway career, Davis started a burger business in 1994 which progressed into Event Catering, supplying venues and events all over the south of the country with their Public Catering requirements. Among the contracts they obtained are The Royal Imperial War Museum at Duxford, Newbury Racecourse, Fontwell Racecourse, Bath Racecourse, Chepstow Racecourse, Wincanton Racecourse, The Ageas Bowl (Hampshire Cricket Ground), The PSP Southampton Boat Show, The Norfolk Spectacular Music Festival, Poole Speedway, Bucks Show, Romsey Show, Glastonbury Festival and quite a few Concerts including T4 on the Beach, The British MX GP, Lydden Hill for the Rally Cross events, and Red Bull Moto Cross Series.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Davis", "response": ["John Davis may refer to:", "*John Davis (academic) (1938\u20132017), English anthropologist and Warden of All Souls College, Oxford", "*John Davis (paediatrician) (born 1923), British emeritus professor of paediatrics", "*John Davis (sculptor) (1936\u20131999), Australian sculptor", "*John Davis, character in After Many Years", "*John Davis (EastEnders), fictional character on British soap opera, Eastenders", "*Sergeant John Davis, a playable character in Call of Duty 2", "*John Davis (producer) (born 1954), American film producer", "*John Davis (filmmaker) (1944\u20132015), Australian documentary filmmaker", "*John Davis (singer) (1954\u20132021), American singer", "*Blind John Davis (1913\u20131985), American blues pianist", "*John Davis (pianist) (born 1957), American classical pianist", "*John Davis (album), a 2005 album by singer-songwriter John Davis", "*John Davis and the Monster Orchestra, 1970s band", "*John Davis (singer-songwriter) (born 1974), Superdrag member", "*John Davis (U.S. district court judge) (1761\u20131847), Massachusetts state representative and federal judge", "*John Davis (United States Court of Claims judge) (1851\u20131902), Assistant Secretary of State and judge of Court of Claims", "*John Davis (American Civil War sailor) (died 1863), United States Navy, Medal of Honor recipient for actions in 1862", "*John Davis (American Civil War soldier) (1838\u20131901), United States Army, Medal of Honor recipient for actions in 1865", "*John Davis (Medal of Honor, 1881) (1854\u20131903), United States Navy, Medal of Honor recipient for actions in 1881", "*John Davis (Medal of Honor, 1898) (1877\u20131970), United States Navy, Medal of Honor recipient for actions in 1898", "*Sir John Davis (RAF officer) (1911\u20131989), Royal Air Force air chief marshal", "*Sir John Davis (British Army officer) (1832\u20131901), British general", "*John Davis, officer of the British commando Force 136 in WWII Malaya", "*John Davis (Kansas politician) (1826\u20131901), U.S. Representative from Kansas", "*John Davis (Massachusetts governor) (1787\u20131854), Governor of Massachusetts, 1834\u20131835; 1841\u20131843", "*John Davis (Oregon politician), member of the Oregon House of Representatives", "*John Davis (Pennsylvania politician) (1788\u20131878), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania", "*John Davis (Australian politician) (1817\u20131893), Australian pastoralist in colonial Western Australia", "*John Davis (pitcher, born 1883) (1883\u20131946), Negro leagues pitcher", "*John Davis (pitcher, born 1963) (born 1963), Major League Baseball player for San Francisco Giants", "*Quack Davis (John Davis), Negro leagues outfielder", "*John Davis (cricketer, born 1882) (1882\u20131963), English cricketer for Derbyshire", "*John Davis (Worcestershire cricketer) (1884\u20131951), English cricketer", "*John Davis (cricketer, born 1939), Welsh cricketer", "*John Davis (cricketer, born 1943) (1943\u20132000), English cricketer", "*John Davis (footballer), soccer player", "*John Davis (offensive lineman) (born 1965), American football offensive lineman", "*John Davis (tight end) (born 1973), American football tight end", "*John Davis (rower) (1929\u20132017), American Olympic rower", "*John Davis (skier), American para-alpine skier", "*John Davis (speedway rider) (born 1954), English speedway rider", "*John Davis (swimmer) (born 1978), New Zealand swimmer", "*John Davis (weightlifter) (1921\u20131984), American Olympian, gold medalist", "*John Davis (British businessman) (1906\u20131993), English managing director of the Rank Organisation, later Chairman", "*John Davis (buccaneer) (alias of Robert Searle), English buccaneer", "*John Davis (explorer) (1550\u20131605), English navigator and explorer", "*John Davis (entrepreneur) (born 1953), American entrepreneur", "*John Davis (sealer) (1784\u2013?), American who claimed to have first set foot on Antarctica"]}, {"page": "Reading Racers", "response": ["The club enjoyed a successful 1980 season, winning the British League title and attracting crowds of over 7,000 on a regular basis. Reading's success came down to three strong heat leaders, Swedish champion Jan Andersson, their new American signing Bobby Schwartz and England international John Davis. All three produced season averages around the 10 mark, which enabled the team to constantly pick up victories. The club made headline news with a \u00a340,000 insurance bond payment for winning the league title, which gained much media interest. However, behind the scenes unrest in the management structure saw major changes at the end of the season with Bill Dore taking control of the club with local businessman Frankie Higley. Dore's daughter Pat Bliss became more involved in the running of the speedway and Dore's son Martyn was tasked with the maintenance of the track and stadium. Despite tracking very competitive looking teams in the mid-1980s the club never achieved the dizzy heights of the start of the decade, until 1990 when the appointment of loyal fan Tim Sugar as the team manager saw the club win the league title in both 1990 and 1992, with top rider Per Jonsson also crowned world speedway champion in 1990. Jeremy Doncaster and their new Australian signing Todd Wiltshire topped the reading averages in 1990 and Jonsson averaged 10.04 in 1992. However, Jonsson suffered terrible injuries in a crash in Poland in 1994, and this had an adverse effect on the club and its fortunes. 1995 and 1996 were poor seasons for the club, as crowds dropped and media interest waned. ", "The club opted to drop a division to the Premier League in 2008, the season was a traumatic time on and off track for the club. Povey and Holloway's team building decisions proved disastrous, with only Dane Ulrich \u00d8stergaard's performances saving their blushes on numerous occasions.  However performances on track were overshadowed by the news that the Smallmead Stadium lease expired in October 2008 and would not be renewed. A final farewell meeting was held on 19 October 2008, as a near capacity crowd of 3,200 including former Reading riders Anders Michanek, Jan Andersson, Bernie Leigh, John Davis, Richard May, Tony Olsson and Phil Morris witnessed Ulrich Ostergaard win the \u00a33,000 winner's purse."]}, {"page": "Peter Collins (speedway rider)", "response": ["*1977 \u2013  Wroc\u0142aw, Olympic Stadium (with Malcolm Simmons / Michael Lee / Dave Jessup / John Davis) \u2013 Winner \u2013 37pts (10)"]}, {"page": "Chris Morton", "response": ["* 1981 -  Olching, Olching Speedwaybahn (with Dave Jessup / Kenny Carter / John Davis / Gordon Kennett) - 2nd - 29pts (11)"]}, {"page": "Kenny Carter", "response": ["* 1981 -  Olching, Speedway Stadion Olching (with Dave Jessup / Chris Morton / John Davis / Gordon Kennett) - 2nd - 29pts (9)"]}, {"page": "Oxford Cheetahs", "response": ["| 1971    || Arthur Price ||Brian Clark||Col Cottrell||Colin Gooddy||John Davis||John Jackson||Ken McKinlay||Laurie Sims", "| 1972    || Bobby McNeil||Colin Gooddy||Gary Middleton|| Gordon Kennett||John Davis||Julian Wigg||Ken McKinlay||Laurie Sims", "| 1973    || Bob Kilby|| Bobby McNeil||Eddie Reeves||Gordon Kennett||Hasse Holmqvist||John Davis||John Dews||Malcolm Ballard", "| 1974    || Bob Kilby|| Bobby McNeil||Brian Clark||Gordon Kennett||Henk Steman||John Davis||John Dews||Martin Yeates"]}, {"page": "Stadion Olimpijski (Wroc\u0142aw)", "response": ["* 1977 \u2013  England (Peter Collins / Michael Lee / Dave Jessup / John Davis / Malcolm Simmons) \u2013 37pts", "* 1980 \u2013  England (Michael Lee / Chris Morton / Peter Collins / Dave Jessup / John Davis) \u2013 40pts"]}, {"page": "British Speedway Championship", "response": ["| |John Davis"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Simmons", "response": ["*1977 -  Wroc\u0142aw, Olympic Stadium (with Peter Collins / Michael Lee / Dave Jessup / John Davis) - Winner - 37pts (9)"]}, {"page": "Gordon Kennett", "response": ["* 1981 -  Olching, Speedway Stadion Olching (with Dave Jessup / Chris Morton / Kenny Carter / John Davis) - 2nd - 29pts (1)"]}, {"page": "Michael Lee (speedway rider)", "response": ["* 1977 -  Wroc\u0142aw, Olympic Stadium (with Peter Collins / Malcolm Simmons / Dave Jessup / John Davis) - Winner - 37pts (9)"]}, {"page": "Kelvin Tatum", "response": ["* 1985 -  Long Beach, Veterans Memorial Stadium (with Jeremy Doncaster / Phil Collins / Richard Knight / John Davis) \u2013 3rd \u2013 13pts (3)"]}, {"page": "Great Britain national speedway team", "response": ["| John Davis", "| John Davis"]}, {"page": "Dave Jessup", "response": ["* 1977 -  Wroc\u0142aw, Olympic Stadium (with Peter Collins / Michael Lee / John Davis / Malcolm Simmons) - Winner - 37pts (9)", "* 1981 -  Olching, Olching Speedwaybahn (with Chris Morton / Kenny Carter / John Davis / Gordon Kennett) - 2nd - 29pts (3)"]}, {"page": "Speedway World Team Cup", "response": ["|| England 37 Peter Collins (10)Dave Jessup (9)Michael Lee (9)John Davis (6)Malcolm Simmons (3)", "|| England 40 Chris Morton (11)Michael Lee (11)Peter Collins (10)Dave Jessup (8)John Davis (dnr)", "|| England 29 Chris Morton (11)Kenny Carter (9)John Davis (5)Dave Jessup (3)Gordon Kennett (1)", "|| England 13 Jeremy Doncaster (6)Kelvin Tatum (3)Phil Collins (2)Richard Knight (2)John Davis (0)"]}, {"page": "Phil Collins (speedway rider)", "response": ["* 1985 -  Long Beach, Veterans Memorial Stadium (with Jeremy Doncaster / Kelvin Tatum / Richard Knight / John Davis) \u2013 3rd \u2013 13pts (2)"]}, {"page": "Jeremy Doncaster", "response": ["* 1985 -  Long Beach, Veterans Memorial Stadium (with Phil Collins / Kelvin Tatum / Richard Knight / John Davis) \u2013 3rd \u2013 13pts (6)"]}, {"page": "Richard Knight (speedway rider)", "response": ["* 1985 \u2013  Long Beach, Veterans Memorial Stadium (with Jeremy Doncaster / Phil Collins / Kelvin Tatum / John Davis) \u2013 3rd \u2013 13pts (2)"]}, {"page": "1977 British League season", "response": ["| John Davis"]}, {"page": "1979 British League season", "response": ["| John Davis"]}, {"page": "1980 British League season", "response": ["Reading's success came down to three strong heat leaders, Swedish champion Jan Andersson, their new American signing Bobby Schwartz and England international John Davis.
