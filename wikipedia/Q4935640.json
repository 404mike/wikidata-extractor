He moved to England to play for Middlesbrough but returned to Scotland a year later to play for Hibernian. Thomson played 78 games for Hibs, but he was banned for six months after an incident with a linesman during a match against St Johnstone in 1983. He was a regular under the management of Pat Stanton, but fell out of favour when John Blackley became Hibs manager. Thomson briefly returned to Morton in 1985, on loan from Hibs.\nThomson joined Blackpool in August 1985, at a time when the club was about to embark on something of a revival under the management of Sam Ellis. \"Thomson's aggression and experience will stiffen competition in the attack,\" said Ellis of the signing. A brief spell at Hartlepool United followed, before joining Hamilton Academical. Thomson then moved into non-League football with Southport.\nSince retiring from football, Thomson has been employed as a day care worker. His daughter, Hollie, has played for Hibernian and Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Thomson", "response": ["Robert, Rob, Robbie, Bob or Bobby Thomson may refer to:", "* Bobby Thomson (1923\u20132010), Major League baseball player who hit \"The Shot Heard Round the World\"", "* Bobby Thomson (footballer, born 1937), former Aston Villa and Birmingham City footballer", "* Bobby Thomson (footballer, born 1939), Scottish footballer (Partick Thistle, Liverpool FC, Luton Town)", "* Bobby Thomson (footballer, born 1943) (1943\u20132009), former England and Wolverhampton Wanderers footballer", "* Bobby Thomson (footballer, born 1955), Scottish footballer (Hibernian, Blackpool FC)"]}, {"page": "Willie Irvine (footballer, born 1956)", "response": ["Irvine had a successful spell with Motherwell, as he was their top scorer with 21 goals during their promotion season of 1981\u201382.

Irvine was also initially successful with the Edinburgh club, forming a strike partnership with Bobby Thomson that led to him being the second top goalscorer in the Scottish Premier Division in 1983\u201384.
