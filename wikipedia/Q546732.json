A mark of this respect was demonstrated with the inclusion of two of her articles in volume one of A New History of Ireland, published in 2006. Despite both having been written in 1974, they were included because\n\n\"she was one of the most distinguished early Irish church historian(s) of her generation\", and as they had \"been heralded as forthcoming since her death. The editors therefore felt that it was only right to print the chapters as she wrote; Dr. Ann Hamlin, a friend of Kathleen Hughes, kindly undertook to complete the footnote reference and to update them where necessary.\"\n\nHughes obtained her Ph.D in London, and became a fellow at Newnham College, Cambridge. She was the Nora Chadwick Reader in Celtic Studies, Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge. Among her best-known works was The Modern Traveller to the Early Irish Church, which was co-written with Dr. Hamlin.\nIn 1973 she delivered the British Academy's Sir John Rh\u0177s Memorial Lecture.Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe: Studies in Memory of Kathleen Hughes was published in 1981 and edited by Dorothy Whitelock, Rosamond McKitterick and David Dumville. Hughes is also commemorated by the Kathleen Hughes Fund. In 2000, Hughes Hall, Cambridge instituted the annual Kathleen Hughes Memorial Lecture, a pamphlet is produced for each lecture by the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse & Celtic.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Celtic Christianity", "response": ["The term Celtic Church is deprecated by many historians as it implies a unified and identifiable entity entirely separate from that of mainstream Western Christendom.; ; ; ; Kathleen Hughes, The Church in Early English Society (London, 1966); W. Davies and P. Wormald, The Celtic Church (Audio Learning Tapes, 1980). For this reason, many prefer the term Insular Christianity. As Patrick Wormald explained, \"One of the common misconceptions is that there was a Roman Church to which the Celtic Church was nationally opposed.\"", "This focus on the monastery has led some scholars, most notably Kathleen Hughes, to argue that the monastic system came to be the dominant ecclesiastical structure in the Irish church, essentially replacing the earlier episcopal structure of the type found in most of the rest of the Christian world. Hughes argued that the paruchia, or network of monasteries attached to an abbey, replaced the diocese as the chief administrative unit of the church, and the position of Abbot largely replaced that of bishop in authority and prominence. According to this model, bishops were still needed, since certain sacramental functions were reserved only for the ordained, but they had little authority in the ecclesiastical structure."]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Kathleen Hughes (1926\u20131977)"]}, {"page": "Palladius (bishop of Ireland)", "response": ["Prosper of Aquitaine describes Palladius as a deacon.

The coverage of the period 766 to 973 is lost, but is thought to survive in abbreviated form in the Chronicon Scottorum (abbr. CT). The latter is defective for the period 718 to 804, but as much of its content is derived from the hypothetical Chronicle of Ireland (itself partly derived from the Iona Chronicle), of which the Annals of Ulster (abbr.

Glas has a figurative meaning of \"fresh, raw, sharp\" (in regard to weather) and \"harsh\" (morally); it also applies to complexion (\"wan\") or the discoloration of a corpse as \"bluish, livid.\" The Irish treatise De arreis prescribes \"fearsome penances\" such as spending the night immersed in water or on nettles or nutshells or in the presence of a corpse. In one 12th-century Irish poem, the speaker Suibne Geilt, a dweller in the wilderness, says \"My feet are wounded; my cheek is glas.\" In a much-referenced analysis of the Irish colors of martyrdom, Clare Stancliffe presented comparative textual evidence to suggest that glas martyrdom was so called because its austerity produced a sickly pale complexion.Clare Stancliffe, \"Red, White and Blue Martyrdom,\" in Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe. Studies in memory of Kathleen Hughes (Cambridge University Press, 1982), passim, especially pp. 29, 35 and 41. The Latin equivalent of glas, Stancliffe argues, is iacinthus or hyacinthus; this is a somewhat unorthodox view. Hyacinthus is a problematic color word, in ancient Greek meaning either \"blue-black, purplish black\" or \"orange, saffron\"; see M. Eleanor Irwin, \"Odysseus' 'Hyacinthine Hair' in Odyssey 6.231,\" Phoenix 44.3 (1990) 205-218 (where it is argued that in context the word means \"curled\").", "* Stancliffe, Clare. \"Red, white and blue martyrdom.\" In Ireland in Early Mediaeval Europe.

Unlike Geoffrey Keating Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn, he did not attempt to synthesise the material into a unified whole, instead recording and transmitting it unaltered. However, historians as late as such as Eugene O'Curry (1794\u20131862) and John O'Donovan (1806\u20131861) sometimes accepted the doctrine and a nationalistic interpretation of Irish history uncritically. During the 20th century the doctrine was reinterpreted by the work of historians such as Eoin MacNeill, T. F. O'Rahilly, Francis John Byrne, Kathleen Hughes (historian), and Kenneth Nicholls."]}]}}
