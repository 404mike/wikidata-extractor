At the time the fee was undisclosed even to the player. Villa signed Kingaby for the football maximum wage of \u00a34 a week but after two months were unimpressed with his ability. Villa was not willing to lose the \u00a3300 by allowing a free transfer. They offered to sell Herbert back at half price but neither Clapton, nor any other club were interested. Kingaby's wage was stopped but he was placed on Villa's retained players' list effectively preventing him earning a living in the English League, so he joined Fulham back in the Southern League.He rejoined Clapton Orient at the start of the 1910-11 season. That year the Football League and the Southern League agreed mutual recognition of each other's retain-and-transfer system. Villa now disclosed that Kingaby was still on their retained players' list and demanded \u00a3350. This prevented a move to Croydon Common but he eventually joined Peterborough City.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Professional Footballers' Association", "response": ["The 1910s saw the Union backing a challenge by Herbert Kingaby against the retain and transfer system in the courts.
