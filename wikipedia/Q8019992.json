He first entered the House of Commons at the 1945 general election, as the Member of Parliament for Luton in Bedfordshire. However, at the 1950 general election, he lost his seat to the Conservative Party candidate Charles Hill, the former \"radio doctor\".\nWarbey re-entered Parliament at a 1953 by-election for the Nottinghamshire constituency of Broxtowe, following the death of sitting Labour MP Seymour Cocks. However, that constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, at which Warbey was returned for the new Ashfield constituency. He held the seat until his retirement at the 1966 general election.\nHe was known for his strong opposition to British support for the United States in the Vietnam War, resigning the Labour whip in protest in September 1966, and \"subsequently wrote a scathing book about [Harold] Wilson's support for the United States\".He died in Eastbourne aged 76.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Warbey"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Warbey"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Warbey"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Warbey"]}, {"page": "Hackney Downs School", "response": ["* William Warbey, Labour MP 1945\u201350 for Luton, and 1953\u201355 for Broxtowe, and 1955\u201366 for Ashfield"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|William Warbey"]}, {"page": "William Noble Warbey", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Warbey"]}, {"page": "John Platts-Mills", "response": ["Platts-Mills organised a petition in support of Pietro Nenni and the Italian Socialist Party in its general election campaign which was signed by 36 MPs. It was contentious because Nenni's party was in alliance with the Italian Communist Party. Almost all of the MPs retracted their support when asked to do so, but Platts-Mills was the exception. He was already under investigation by the Party's National Executive Committee and was expelled from the Labour Party in April 1948 after he submitted a statement which was found unacceptable. Officially, the Labour Party had given its support to the rival, non-communist aligned, Socialist Unity alliance. His expulsion led to the formation in 1949 of the Labour Independent Group which gained support from four other Soviet-sympathising ex-Labour MPs: Konni Zilliacus, D. N. Pritt, Geoffrey Bing and William Warbey. Platts-Mills stood as an Independent Labour candidate in the new Shoreditch and Finsbury constituency in the 1950 general election but only came third. Platts-Mills was opposed to NATO and claimed that the United States had too much power in Europe. He was readmitted to the Labour Party in 1969 after previous attempts in 1964 and 1966 were unsuccessful."]}, {"page": "Politics in Luton", "response": ["|William Warbey || Labour"]}, {"page": "1953 Broxtowe by-election", "response": ["The Broxtowe by-election was held on 17 September 1953.
