He gained pre-eminence as an indoor games and mind sports consultant, a role that he in effect created. A natural games player, it was to him that inventors or publishers would turn to organise a championship of a new game, write about it or generally promote it.Though nearly a million copies of his chess books have been sold, Pritchard is best known for authoring The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, in which he describes more than 1400 different variants.\nIn addition to authoring books on games, Pritchard was editor of Games & Puzzles magazine from 1972 to 1981. He was also a games director for the Mind Sports Organisation, and president of the British Chess Variants Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chess variants", "response": ["* Three-check chess: Standard rules of chess apply, but a player can win by putting their opponent in check three times.

He used an 8\u00d78\u00d78 board, labelling the third dimension with Greek letters alpha through theta. This format was later picked up by Maack in 1907 when developing Raumschach. According to David Pritchard, this format is: the most popular 3\u2011D board amongst inventors, and at the same time the most mentally indigestible for the players ... Less demanding on spatial vision, and hence more practical, are those games confined to three 8\u00d78 boards and games with boards smaller than 8\u00d78."]}, {"page": "Losing chess", "response": ["David Pritchard, the author of The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, wrote that the \"complexity and beauty\" of losing chess is found in its endgame. He noted that, in contrast to regular chess, losing chess endgames with just two pieces require considerable skill to play correctly, whereas three- or four-piece endgames can exceed human capacity to solve precisely. For example, the following endgames may turn out to be quite complicated: 2 Knights vs Rook, 3 Kings vs King, or Bishop+Knight+King vs King. In the latter case, in particular, a win may require more than 60 moves, which means that it is sometimes unattainable due to the fifty-move rule."]}, {"page": "Entropy (1977 board game)", "response": ["Entropy was awarded a rare 6 out of 6 by Games & Puzzles Magazine in 1981.Entropy, Mind Sports Olympiad supplement, p 8, The Times, 11 August 1997, online version available from studiogiochi MSO archives  David Pritchard called the game \"a modern classic\".
