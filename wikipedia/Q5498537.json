This accident occurred during blasting operations., at pp. 26 (White Pass), 52 (Summit Lake), 63 (Duncan C. Fraser), 94 (Crater Lake), 99 (W. T.

Graves), 358-59 (Michael J. Heney).  One of the workers was Maurice Dunn (1861-1898), who had lived in Michigan and California.The name \"Maurice Dunn\" strongly aligns with a person shown in U.S. Census and California State Voter records.  Maurice Dunn was born June 11, 1861 in Branch County, Michigan.  He lived there on his parents' farm until at least 1880.  He resided at El Monte, California, at least from 1890 to 1896.  During those six years, he had been a saloonkeeper, farmer, and laborer.  His name abruptly vanished from public records after 1896.  By 1902, an older brother, Michael Edward Dunn (1857-1934), apparently had at least presumed Maurice's death.  In that year, Michael named his eldest son Maurice Edward Dunn (1902-1977).  The other worker is \"supposed to be\", \"A. Janeaux,\" but there has been no corroboration for that latter name or any variant thereof.In contrast with \"Maurice Dunn,\" the name \"A. Janeaux\" and its variants do not easily align with any person shown in public records.  Furthermore, the then-contemporary (1898) White Pass business document which recites the name reads: \"A. Janeaux, killed opposite Camp 6 Aug 10, 1898, by falling rock.  Body supposed to be under rock, never recovered.\"  (emphasis added)  If anything is \"supposed,\" it has to include the name \"A. Janeaux.\"  One cannot be certain of the name of someone killed, if one only \"supposed\" that, that person was even killed at all.  In fact, this supposition is reflected in a contemporary news article, which reads: \"Two men, whose names have not been learned, were killed while blasting on the Skagway railroad.\"  9 Daily Capital Journal (Salem, Oregon), No. 210 (Aug. 19, 1898), page 3, Col. 4 (Alaska Steamer Arrives \u00b6 2).  Because there has been no corroboration for the name \"A. Janeaux,\" that name remains \"supposed.\"", "Pennington (Mile Post 51.6 Station) was named for Frederick Pennington (1819-1914), an early shareholder of the WP&YR."]}, {"page": "Pennington (surname)", "response": ["* Frederick Pennington (1819\u20131914), English merchant and politician"]}, {"page": "Ursula Bright", "response": ["Bright was born in 1835 to Joseph and Catherine Mellor.
