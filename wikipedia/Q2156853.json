Davidson was educated at Marischal College, where he studied second and third year classes of Marischal College from 1819-1821, including lectures from Professor Patrick Copland. He got this education in return for being a lab assistant.\nIn the 1820s he set up in business close to the Aberdeen-Inverurie Canal, at first supplying yeast, before becoming involved in the manufacture and supply of chemicals.He became interested in the new electrical technologies of the day. From 1837, he made small electric motors on his own principles, though William H. Taylor in the US made similar motors from 1838. Both men worked independently without knowledge of the other's work.", "link_mentions": {}}}
