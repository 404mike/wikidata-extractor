He has held various positions of leadership and has been instrumental in many developments in the community.Subhuti was influential in the building of the London Buddhist Centre, which opened in 1978, and he helped to raise funds from the Greater London Council for its completion. He developed training for men preparing to be ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order at Padmaloka retreat centre, near Norwich in England. He also helped to found Guhyaloka, a retreat centre in Spain, where men make final preparations to become members of the order.As well as being involved in the spread of the Dharma in the West, particularly in Britain, Subhuti spends six months each year working with the community's Indian wing, the Triratna Bauddha Mah\u0101sa\u1e45gha (TBM).Most of TBM's members are drawn from the poorest people in India, sometimes referred to as Dalits, or so-called 'untouchables'. The late Dalit leader, Dr. Ambedkar, converted to Buddhism, saying it was necessary to escape the caste oppression and discrimination which this group experienced.  Hundreds of thousands of Dr Ambedkar's followers subsequently converted to Buddhism.\nFollowing the turn of the millennium Subhuti raised concerns over the circumstances of some of Sangharakshita's past sexual relationships, and around the same time his chairmanship of Triratna's Preceptors College was handed on to Dharmachari Dhammarati. In recent years Subhuti and Sangharakshita have been collaborating closely to produce a series of new articles clarifying and reemphasizing Triratna's core approach and principles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sangharakshita", "response": ["* Dharmachari Subhuti \u2013 Senior associate of Sangharakshita"]}, {"page": "Triratna Buddhist Community", "response": ["Following The Guardian report, a widespread debate ensued. Critics pointed to writings by Sangharakshita, and his senior advisor Dharmachari Subhuti, which placed such emphasis on single-sex activities, and what the Triratna Buddhist Community calls \u201cspiritual friendship\u201d, that the potential for misunderstandings or inappropriate behaviour appeared to some to be inevitable."]}]}}
