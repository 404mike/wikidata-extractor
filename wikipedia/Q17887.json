Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as murder by poisoning in \"Coffee Homeground\", an alcoholic mother in \"Ran Tan Waltz\" and the upbeat \"The Wedding List\", a song inspired by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's 1967 film of Cornell Woolrich's The Bride Wore Black about the murder of a groom and the bride's subsequent revenge against the killer. Bush has also cited comedy as a significant influence. She has cited Woody Allen, Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, and The Young Ones as particular favourites."]}, {"page": "1960s", "response": ["* Jack Clayton"]}, {"page": "1970s", "response": ["* Jack Clayton"]}, {"page": "1995", "response": ["* February 26 \u2013 Jack Clayton, British film director (b. 1921)"]}, {"page": "1921", "response": ["** Jack Clayton, British film director (d. 1995)"]}, {"page": "Deborah Kerr", "response": ["| The Innocents || Miss Giddens || Jack Clayton || "]}, {"page": "Apt Pupil (film)", "response": ["Bryan Singer first read Apt Pupil when he was 19 years old, and when he became a director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a spec script adapting the novella.  Boyce recalled the writing process, \"I thought it was a great stageplay, actually ... two people, pretty much in a house talking.  My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't work out, at least I'd have a writing sample.\" When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film The Usual Suspects (1995), which had yet to be publicly released. Impressed with Singer, King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released. (Reprinted from the Los Angeles Times.) Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, \"Stephen loved it. He seemed to think I captured the mood of the piece.\" The director appreciated being able to make a Stephen King horror film but with less supernatural terror and more character-driven terror. Singer spoke of his goal: \"There have been a lot of fun horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But I miss movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and The Innocents by Jack Clayton, so this is a movie sort of in the spirit of the real horror movie.\""]}, {"page": "The Great Gatsby", "response": ["Following the 1926 movie was 1949's The Great Gatsby, directed by Elliott Nugent and starring Alan Ladd, Betty Field and Macdonald Carey.;  Twenty-five years later in 1974, The Great Gatsby appeared onscreen again.
