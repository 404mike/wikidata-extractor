He is best remembered for his involvement in the BAC TSR-2 test programme, being one of only three test pilots to fly the aircraft before the project was scrapped in 1965.James Dell (known as Jimmy Dell) was born in Liverpool in 1924 and joined the Royal Air Force in 1942. After pilot training in Rhodesia he became a flight instructor. Dell remained in the RAF until 1959, retiring with the rank of wing commander, to join English Electric as their deputy chief test pilot.\nDell appeared in a 1962 episode of \"Look at Life\", in which his work as a test pilot is portrayed.Dell, along with chief test pilot Roland Beamont, was responsible for the TSR-2 test programme until it was controversially cancelled by the then Labour Government in 1965. Following Beamont's retirement in 1965, Dell became BAC's chief test pilot, and was later involved in the Jaguar and Panavia Tornado projects. He retired as director of flight operations for British Aerospace in 1989.\nJimmy Dell died on 25 March 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Aircraft Corporation", "response": ["* Jimmy Dell"]}, {"page": "BAC TSR-2", "response": ["Over a period of six months, a total of 24 test flights were conducted.\"Wing Commander Jimmy Dell: Pilot who established his reputation in fighters and went on to test both the Lightning and the TSR 2\".

Most of the complex electronics were not fitted to the first aircraft, so these flights were all concerned with the basic flying qualities of the aircraft which, according to the test pilots involved, were outstanding.

Undercarriage vibration problems continued, however, and only in the final few flights, when XR219 was fitted with additional tie-struts on the already complex landing gear, was there a significant reduction in them.Wood 1986, p. 179.Hunter 1998, p. 179.
