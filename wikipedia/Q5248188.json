That same year he displayed his work at the new CEMA Gallery. An invited artist, he showed alongside several others including Colin Middleton, Deborah Brown, Gerard Dillon and William Conor, at the inaugural exhibition in the gallery designed by the architect Robert McKinstry. In 1961 Flanagan was patronised with a one-man show at CEMA's Chicester Street Gallery of which the Belfast Telegraph's Kenneth Jamison writes,\"Light is the artist's theme, its flux rain-filtered over moist fields, spilling an irregular pattern on low lough-side hills, mirrored again from the still lough's face...Always one is conscious of the infinite subtle modulations of light and colour. He does not refine forms. Rather he simplifies in terms of light and paint to reveal the sheer mood and poetry of the experience;  but there is nothing casual about the structure of his pictures.\"Flanagan produced the set for the Lyric's production of JM Synge's Deirdre of the Sorrows in 1963. Flanagan had a one-man exhibition at the Richie Hendricks Gallery in Dublin and showed two works at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art's twenty-fifth anniversary show in 1964. He showed in the Four Ulster Painters exhibition at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol in 1964.", "Deborah Brown invited Flanagan on to the committee to oversee an arts bursary scheme set-up in memory of patron of the arts, Alice Berger-Hammerschlag in 1970 which aided many younger artists to travel and to purchase equipment and materials. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland's gallery was the venue for Flanagan's 1966 solo exhibition. In 1968 Flanagan's work travelled to John Hewitt's Herbert Art Gallery for a joint show where he exhibited with Colin Middleton. Flanagan donated a picture to an exhibition to raise funds for victims of civil disturbances in Belfast in the autumn of 1969.

The Ulster Museum, the Royal Society of Arts and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland hold examples of her work.

The couple married in February 1948 a few months after their first meeting. At the time, Jean Osborne was living in abject poverty but things did not immediately improve with marriage as her husband Dennis described a particularly bleak Christmas Eve in Belfast in the early 1950s:\"...when everybody was getting ready to have a good time, I didn't have a bean. [...] I went into a pub and said, 'Anybody want to buy a painting? Ten Quid.' I was lucky to sell it. That was our Christmas day.\"In her graduation year Osborne was selected to show alongside other leading Ulster artists including Kathleen Bridle, John Luke, Dan O'Neill, and Deborah Brown, at the exhibition of Contemporary Ulster Art at the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery, which formed part of the Festival of Britain.
