Two lines in this poem are translated by Koch as \"fierce Gwallawc wrought the great and renowned mortality at Catraeth\". He identifies Gwallawc as the \"Guallauc\" who was one of the kings who fought against Bernicia in alliance with Urien. Koch draws attention to the mention of meibion Godebawc (the sons of Godebog) as an enemy in stanza 15 of Y Gododdin and points out that according to old Welsh genealogies Urien and other Brittonic kings were descendants of \"Co\u00efl Hen Guotepauc\" (Coel Hen).Koch (1997), pp. xxiii\u2013xxv. He considers that, in view of the references in the three poems, there is a case for identifying the attack on Catraeth recorded in Y Gododdin with the Battle of Gwen Ystrat. This would date the poem to about 570 rather than the c. 600 favoured by Williams and others.  He interprets the Gododdin as having fought the Britons of Rheged and Alt Clut over a power struggle in Elmet, with Anglian allies on both sides, Rheged being in an alliance with Deira. He points out that according to the Historia Britonnum it was Rhun, son of Urien Rheged who baptized the princess Eanfl\u00e6d of Deira, her father Edwin, and 12,000 of his subjects in 626 or 627.Koch (1997), p. xxxiii. Urien Rheged was thus the real victor of the battle. Mynyddog Mwynfawr was not a person's name but a personal description meaning 'mountain feast' or 'mountain chief'. Some aspects of Koch's view of the historical context have been criticised by both Oliver Padel and Tim Clarkson. Clarkson, for example, makes the point that the reference in Gweith Gwen Ystrat is to \"the men of Catraeth\"; it does not state that the battle was fought at Catraeth, and also that according to Bede it was Paulinus, not Rhun, who baptized the Deirans."]}, {"page": "Ruth Padel", "response": ["Padel is daughter of psychoanalyst John Hunter Padel and Hilda Barlow, daughter of Sir Alan Barlow and Nora Barlow n\u00e9e Darwin, granddaughter of Charles Darwin, through whom Padel is Darwin's great-great-grandchild.

Geoffrey explicitly identified the two Merlins by making the hero of the Vita a king of Dyfed in south Wales and by having him reminisce, as a preternaturally long-lived man, about his career in the previous century as recorded in the Historia, but the poem nevertheless gives the impression that two different legends have been with some difficulty yoked together, a south Welsh one and a north British one.  The Celticist A. O. H. Jarman proposed in the 1950s that the south Welsh legend concerned a prophet called Myrddin, associated with the town of Carmarthen (in Welsh Caerfyrddin) and named after it, while the northern legend was about a wild man called Lailoken who took part in the battle of Arfderydd in 573.  These two stories, argued Jarman, became fused into one composite legend long before the Vita Merlini was written, and Geoffrey simply used different parts of the story in the Historia and the Vita.  This theory was accepted by most late-20th century scholars, but has been challenged by Rachel Bromwich and Oliver Padel, who have each proposed the possibility that Geoffrey himself was responsible for uniting the southern legend of Myrddin and the northern legend of the wild man."]}, {"page": "Padel", "response": ["*Oliver Padel, historian and Cornish Place-name scholar, son of John"]}, {"page": "John Boson (writer)", "response": ["His work is collected, along with that of Nicholas and Thomas Boson, in Oliver Padel's The Cornish Writings of the Boson Family (1975)."]}, {"page": "King Arthur's messianic return", "response": ["The influence of Arthur's legend is not confined to novels, stories, and films; the legend of Arthur's messianic return has often been politically influential. On the one hand, it seems to have provided a means of rallying Welsh resistance to Anglo-Norman incursions in the 12th century and later. The Anglo-Norman text Description of England recounts of the Welsh that \"openly they go about saying,... / that in the end, they will have it all; / by means of Arthur, they will have it back... / They will call it Britain again.\"O. J. Padel, \"The Nature of Arthur\" in Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies 27 (1994), pp. 1-31 at p.11; C. Bullock-Davies, \"Exspectare Arthurum, Arthur and the Messianic Hope\" in Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies 29 (1980-82), pp.432-440. It may be that such references as this reflect a Welsh belief that Arthur ought to be associated with the \"Mab Darogan\" (\"Son of Prophecy\"), a messianic figure of the Welsh prophetic tradition who would repel the enemies of the Welsh and who was often identified with heroes such as Cadwaladr, Owain Lawgoch and Owain Glynd\u0175r in Welsh prophetic verse.\"The poetry of prophecy sang of revenge against the Saxons (Saeson) and of a national deliverer who would restore Welsh fortunes. The deliverer, the Son of Prophecy, was often named after mythical or historical heroes\".

Green, Concepts of Arthur (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), p.74 for the observation that the link between Arthur and the expulsion of the English is only found in post-Galfridian texts, not pre-Galfridian. However, as Oliver Padel has noted, no example of a Welsh prophetic poetry telling of Arthur's return to expel the enemies of the Welsh from Britain has survived, which some have seen as troubling and a reason for caution: we must rely on non-Welsh texts (such as the above) for the notion that this was a widespread belief amongst the Welsh from the mid-12th century onwards, along with more debatable evidence such as Henry VII's attempts to associate himself with Arthur when taking the throne, discussed below.O. J. Padel, Arthur in Medieval Welsh Literature (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000), pp. 61-3; see Elissa P. Henken, National Redeemer: Owain Glynd\u0175r in Welsh Tradition (University of Wales Press, 1996), pp. 47-53 et passim, on Owain Lawgoch, and Owain Glynd\u0175r, who do appear in the prophetic poetry of the medieval period, and the use of the name \"Owain\" for the Mab Darogan from the late 12th century onwards. .
