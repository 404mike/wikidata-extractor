According to the critic Bill Ectric, \"much of Aylett\u2019s work combines the bawdy, action-oriented style of Voltaire with the sedentary, faux cultivated style of Peacock.\"  Stylistically, Aylett is often seen as a difficult writer. As the critic Robert Kiely suggests, his books tend to be \"baroque in their density, speed, and finely crafted detail; they are overcrowded, they dazzle and distort and wait for us to catch up with their narrative world.\"Although Aylett is best known for his novels, and for his transmedial metafiction Lint, he has also created comics, stand-up, performance, music, movies, and art, often working in appropriative and other avant-garde modes. Aylett is also one of the few UK authors associated with the largely US-based Bizarro literary movement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Moorcock", "response": ["Moorcock has allowed other writers to create stories in his fictional Jerry Cornelius universe.
