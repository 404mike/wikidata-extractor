Wright joined the University of Glasgow in 1946 as a lecturer in History. In 1957 he was appointed Professor of Modern History, a post he held until his election to parliament ten years later. His students at Glasgow included future Labour Party Leader John Smith and Donald Dewar, later the first First Minister of Scotland. During this time he became known in both Scotland and England with his obituary in The Independent describing him as one of Britain's 'early \"media dons\"'.In a 1967 by-election, he was returned as a Conservative Member of Parliament for the previously Labour-held seat of Glasgow Pollok. Wright defeated Dick Douglas, who would later have two spells as a Labour MP and defect to the Scottish National Party. Wright reportedly had 'no strong political ambitions' and had apparently not expected to win the contest. He was defeated by Labour's James White in the 1970 General Election. Tam Dalyell believed had Wright retained his seat, he might well have been a Treasury minister in the Heath Ministry.After his defeat Wright returned to academia becoming Director of the Institute of US Studies and Professor of American History at the University of London in 1971, a post he held until 1983. He was also Principal of Swinton  Conservative College in Masham form 1972 until 1976.He was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1988, reportedly, the award that gave him 'greatest pleasure'. In 1981 he delivered the British Academy's Sarah Tryphena Phillips Lecture in American Literature and History.", "link_mentions": {}}}
