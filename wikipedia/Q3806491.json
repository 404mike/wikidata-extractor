He coordinated his efforts with a group of other peers who were displeased with the possibility of a Catholic succession; this group met at the home of Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles, and included Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle, Thomas Belasyse, 2nd Viscount Fauconberg, James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, and George Savile, 1st Viscount Halifax. On 8 January 1674, Shaftesbury gave a speech in the House of Lords warning that the 16,000 Catholics living in London were on the verge of rebellion, which caused the Lords to pass an address expelling all Catholics from within 10 miles of London. On 12 January, he introduced a measure that would require every peer, including the Duke of York, to take the Oath of Allegiance renouncing the pope and recognising the royal supremacy in the church (the oath was first required by the Popish Recusants Act of 1605). On 24 January, the Earl of Salisbury introduced a bill requiring that any children of the Duke of York should be raised as Protestants. His proposed legislation further provided that neither the king nor any prince of the blood could marry a Catholic without parliamentary consent, on pain of being excluded from the royal succession. Shaftesbury spoke forcefully in favour of Salisbury's proposal; he was opposed by the bishops and Lord Finch. By February, the opposition lords were considering accusing the Duke of York of high treason, which resulted in the king proroguing parliament on 24 February to protect his brother."]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*** James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury politician, descendant"]}, {"page": "Earl of Salisbury", "response": ["*James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury (1648\u20131683)"]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury"]}, {"page": "John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland", "response": ["*Lady Margaret Manners (died 1682), who married James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, and had children."]}, {"page": "William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury", "response": ["He was succeeded as Earl by his grandson James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, as his son Charles (1619\u20131660) had predeceased him."]}, {"page": "James Cecil", "response": ["*James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury (1648\u20131683)"]}, {"page": "1648 in England", "response": ["* James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, nobleman (died 1683)"]}, {"page": "Countess of Salisbury", "response": ["*Margaret Cecil, Countess of Salisbury (died c.1682), married James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury"]}, {"page": "Robert Cecil (1670\u20131716)", "response": ["Cecil was baptized on  6 November 1670,  the second son of James Cecil, 3rd Earl of Salisbury and his wife Lady Margaret Manners, daughter of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland.
