The Inland Revenue attempted to tax this benefit based on the Finance Act 1976. There was a dispute over the correct interpretation of the Act. The Special Commissioners charged with assessing the tax found in favour of Hart, but both the High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal of England and Wales found in favour of the Inland Revenue. The case then went to the House of Lords, which, making use of statements in Parliament as recorded in Hansard, found in favour of Hart. Lord Mackay, dissenting, argued that Hansard should not be considered admissible evidence because of the time and expense involved in a lawyer having to look up every debate and discussion on a particular statute when giving legal advice or preparing a case."]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**John Hart, teacher, first male winner of Mastermind (b. 1936)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2011", "response": ["*John Hart, 75, English schoolmaster, first man to win Mastermind."]}, {"page": "John Hart (classics)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hart (classicist)"]}, {"page": "John Thornton Hart", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hart (classicist)"]}]}}
