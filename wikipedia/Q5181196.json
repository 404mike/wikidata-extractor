Wright finished the season with two goals from 27\u00a0league games, before playing a further 36\u00a0games the following season. During the campaign, he picked up his first red card of his career, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Aldershot Town. Halifax Town avoided relegation despite a final-day defeat, because Altrincham also lost, but they faced liquidation and were eventually demoted, giving Altrincham a reprieve. Halifax were demoted and applied to join the Northern Premier League Division One North, but instead Wright moved back to the Conference Premier, by signing for Crawley Town in June 2008. He had played 63\u00a0league games for Halifax during his two years. After an impressive season making 41 League appearances, Wright attracted the interest of Football League clubs including Charlton Athletic and Colchester United."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|13||GK|| Craig Mawson || Lincoln City || Loan || 28 September 2000", "|13||GK|| Craig Mawson || Halifax Town || Free || 16 February 2001"]}]}}
