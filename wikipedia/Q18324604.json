He spent much of his career at Brunner Mond and its successor Imperial Chemical Industries, as chief chemist, research manager and in a recruiting capacity, with particular knowledge of phase rule chemistry, and developed many processes related to the manufacture of explosives. He made a critical contribution to the British World War I effort by devising new ways to manufacture ammonium nitrate, which was recognised with an honour, and a smaller contribution in World War II for the Special Operations Executive. Freeth created links between Brunner Mond and Dutch chemistry, particularly at the University of Leiden where he met Kammerlingh Onnes and was awarded a doctorate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Freeth", "response": ["*Francis Arthur Freeth (1884\u20131970), British chemist"]}, {"page": "James Freeth", "response": ["He married Harriett Holt and together they went on to have six sons and two daughters.Ancestry.com Three of his sons became major-generals; his great-grandchild, Francis Arthur Freeth, was a chemist who developed a number of processes in explosives manufacture and a major in the Territorial Army."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| Francis Arthur Freeth||07/05/1925||2 January 1884 \u2013 15 July 1970"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1925", "response": ["*Francis Arthur Freeth"]}, {"page": "Francis Freeth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Arthur Freeth "]}, {"page": "F A Freeth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Arthur Freeth "]}, {"page": "F.

On 27 March 1933 Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett (with Francis Arthur Freeth FRS and Sir Michael Perrin) discovered polyethylene (polythene) at ICI's Winnington Research Laboratory at Winnington, Cheshire; John Crawford, at the Explosives group of ICI at Ardeer, North Ayrshire near Stevenston, produced a commercial synthesis of poly(methyl methacrylate), also known as Perspex with production beginning in 1934. Polythene is the world's most widespread polymer, and was first produced by ICI from 1939; many plastic bottles are made from LDPE. Polystyrene was invented in Germany in 1937.

Aston House was the first to experiment with plastic explosive for sabotage. The Commanding Officer at the House was Col. Leslie J. Cardew Wood a strong contender for the title of the original'Q' - 'Q' character in the James Bond films. for he developed bespoke weapons, tools and gadgets which were used in raids including Lofoten Islands, Dieppe, Norsk Heavy Water Plant, St-Nazaire and Prague. Aston House supplied special weapons to the Special Air Service (SAS), Special Boat Service (SBS), Long Range Patrol Unit (LRP), the Resistance Groups and the Commandos. The station was important in aiding the design and production of the Fairbairn\u2013Sykes fighting knife. Production also included over 12 million No. 10 Time Delay pencil detonator and 38,500 Type 6 Limpet Mines, both made to original Aston House designs. Quality Control, Packaging and Dispatch was continuous and included supplying all the Home Guard Auxiliary Units and the Resistance Groups in Europe, reaching a peak around D-Day. Aston House took on responsibility for the total design, development and testing programme for the 'Sleeping Beauty' Motorised Submersible Canoe (MSC). One of the more exotic devices was the \"explosive rat\". The skinned rats were, filled with plastic explosive, and sewn up. The idea being to place the rats in coal near a boiler, so that they would be thrown in with the coal and cause an explosion. Aston House weapons were also used in the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. Among the many scientific personnel at the station were the inventor of the Number Ten Delay Switch (\"timing pencil\"), Lieutenant-Commander A.J.G. Langley  S.I.S  Secret Intelligence Service, \u203aFrancis Arthur Freeth, Colin Meek and Cecil Vandepeer Clarke."]}]}}
