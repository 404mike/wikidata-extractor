The end of the war several weeks later meant that there was no longer any urgency in refitting the Illustrious in time to participate in the invasion of the Japanese Home Islands and the Admiralty decided that she would become the Home Fleet training and trials carrier. Her catapult was upgraded to handle heavier aircraft, her flight deck was further improved, and her radar suite was modernized. She began her postrefit trials on 24 June 1946 and flying trials the following month. She relieved  as the trials carrier in August and conducted trials on Firefly FR.4s, Firebrand TF.4s, de Havilland Sea Mosquitoes and de Havilland Sea Vampires over the next several months.

They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of  carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral Ralph Edwards pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550. After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the County-class destroyer."]}, {"page": "Mediterranean Fleet", "response": ["| align = left | Vice Admiral Sir Ralph Edwards"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty", "response": ["**Ralph Edwards, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff", "**Ralph Edwards, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff", "**Ralph Edwards, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff", "**Ralph Edwards, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff", "**Ralph Edwards, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff", "**Ralph Edwards, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff", "**Ralph Edwards, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff", "**Ralph Edwards, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff", "**Ralph Edwards, Third Sea Lord", "**Ralph Edwards, Third Sea Lord", "**Ralph Edwards, Third Sea Lord", "**Ralph Edwards, Third Sea Lord", "**Ralph Edwards, Third Sea Lord", "**Ralph Edwards, Third Sea Lord", "**Ralph Edwards, Third Sea Lord"]}, {"page": "HMS Birmingham (C19)", "response": ["In June 1957, she was one of seven warships involved in an exercise off the Turkish Black Sea ports under the Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Sir Ralph Edwards. the exercises led to a strong protest from the Russian government.
