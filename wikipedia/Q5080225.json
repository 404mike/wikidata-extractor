However, in September, the weekly All the Year Round saw its sales fall, and its flagship publication, A Day's Ride by Charles Lever, lost favour with the public. Dickens \"called a council of war\", and believed that to save the situation, \"the one thing to be done was for [him] to strike in.\"Charles Dickens, Letters, Letter to John Forster, 4 October 1860. The \"very fine, new and grotesque idea\" became the magazine's new support: weeklies, five hundred pages, just over one year (1860\u20131861), thirty-six episodes, starting 1 December. The magazine continued to publish Lever's novel until its completion on 23 March 1861, but it became secondary to Great Expectations. Immediately, sales resumed, and critics responded positively, as exemplified by The Timess praise: \"Great Expectations is not, indeed, [Dickens's] best work, but it is to be ranked among his happiest.\"", "Elements of the silver-fork novel are found in the character of Miss Havisham and her world, as well as Pip's illusions. This genre, which flourished in the 1820s and 1830s, presents the flashy elegance and aesthetic frivolities found in high society. In some respects, Dickens conceived Great Expectations as an anti silver fork novel, attacking Charles Lever's novel A Day's Ride, publication of which began January 1860, in Household Words. This can be seen in the way that Dickens satirises the pretensions and morals of Miss Havisham and her sycophants, including the Pockets (except Matthew), and Uncle Pumblechook."]}, {"page": "1872 in literature", "response": ["*June 1 \u2013 Charles Lever, Irish novelist (born 1806)"]}, {"page": "1859 in literature", "response": ["*Charles Lever \u2013 Davenport Dunn: A Man of our Day"]}, {"page": "1844 in literature", "response": ["*Charles Lever \u2013 Tom Burke of Ours"]}, {"page": "1815 in literature", "response": ["*June 15 \u2013 The Duchess of Richmond's ball is held in Brussels on the night before the Battle of Quatre Bras (and three nights before the Battle of Waterloo) by Charlotte, Duchess of Richmond for her son, the writer Lord William Lennox.

Interest in England was centred in the East at the time, and Warburton had popular sympathy with Kinglake in his advocacy of the annexation of Egypt. But, apart from this consideration, the spirited narrative of Warburton's adventures and the picturesque sketches of Eastern life and character were more than sufficient to justify the success of the book.
