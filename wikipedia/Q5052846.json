The Independent wrote in 2012 of Birmingham's \"intangible sense of the other, of being different despite being the bullseye of Britain\". The poet Roy Fisher called it an \"off-shore island in the middle of England\". Writing in 1945, while the poet W. H. Auden was arguably the dominant figure of English literature worldwide,  the American critic Edmund Wilson could still note how his \"Birmingham background\" meant that \"in fundamental ways ... he doesn't belong in that London literary world \u2013 he's more vigorous and more advanced\". However the same characteristic that sets Birmingham apart can also make it difficult to characterise and understand from outside. Disjunction and incongruity lie at the heart of the city's identity, and Birmingham often lacks the superficial unifying aesthetic of more homogenous cities. Writers, artists or musicians cooperating in socially close-knit groups but producing work with little stylistic unity have been a characteristic of Birmingham's culture from the Lunar Society of the 1750s, through the Birmingham Group of the 1890s and the Highfield writers of the 1930s to the B-Town music scene of 2013. The city's \"tradition of the untraditional\", of moving forward through \"waves of creative destruction\", has also led to what the novelist Catherine O'Flynn has called the city's \"complicated relationship with its past, where it's always trying to burn photos of itself\". The result is that Birmingham has never been an easy city to define, its lack of a clear, simple image, coupled with its own characteristically ironic and self-deprecating sense of humour, often leading to its being stereotyped as \"a non-place surrounded by motorways\"."]}, {"page": "Merry Hill Shopping Centre", "response": ["Working at Merry Hill gave Catherine O'Flynn the inspiration for the fictional Green Oaks centre, the main location in her successful novel What Was Lost."]}, {"page": "British Book Awards", "response": ["* 2008 \u2013 Catherine O'Flynn \u2013 "]}, {"page": "Guardian First Book Award", "response": ["*Catherine O'Flynn, What Was Lost"]}, {"page": "Nechells", "response": ["*Catherine O'Flynn.

The city's most notable publisher of literary fiction, Tindal Street Press has built a remarkable record of bringing West Midlands writers to wider attention: of the 48 titles published in its first ten years, 12 were nominated for one or more national or international prizes. Astonishing Splashes of Colour was the first novel by Quinton-based music teacher Clare Morrall. Set in Birmingham and featuring a lead character with synesthesia, it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2003, and subsequently translated into twelve languages, becoming Tindal Street's bestselling title. The Birmingham area also provides settings for several of Morrall's subsequent novels, including 2008's The Language of Others , and 2012's The Roundabout Man. In 2007 Tindal Street published What Was Lost, the debut novel by Hall Green shopworker Catherine O'Flynn. Part ghost story and part mystery, it used the story of the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl from a Birmingham shopping centre to illustrate the changes in an industrial community over two decades, being nominated for both the Booker Prize and the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2007, and winning the first novel award at the 2007 Costa Book Awards. O'Flynn's 2010 second novel The News Where You Are led Fay Weldon to describe her as the \"J. G. Ballard of Birmingham\", noting how O'Flynn \"deals with her particular city, finding poetry and meaning where others see merely boredom and dereliction ... as if the lonely dead of the city's past and present were determined to be heard\". Other local writers who've seen notable success with Tindal Street include the Edgbaston-based social worker Gaynor Arnold and the Black Country writers Raphael Selbourne and Anthony Cartwright. The impact of Tindal Street on promoting the city's writers was summed up by The Observer in 2008: \"The company has an ability to mine local talent, even when their authors' biographies don't ooze glamour ... There are aspiring authors all over the country writing stories between night shifts, but only in Birmingham, it seems, does anyone pay attention.\""]}, {"page": "List of women writers (M\u2013Z)", "response": ["*Catherine O'Flynn (b. 1970, England), fiction wr."]}]}}
