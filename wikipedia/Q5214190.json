The album's stylistic influences included electro, house, breakbeat, techno and ambient. Featuring the acclaimed hits 'Bloodline' and 'Gold Is Your Metal', the album was f\u00eated by leading UK DJs including Trevor Jackson and Andrew Weatherall.

By the time the album was released, Monkey Mafia had expanded into a full band, including Douge Reuben on vocals, Dan Peppe on bass, Tom Symmons on drums, DJ Krash Slaughta (aka Paul Smith) on turntables, and Carter himself on samplers and keyboard programming. The band played the songs live at clubs and music festivals, including tours supporting Roni Size Reprazent in 1997 and Massive Attack in 1999. However, they disbanded in 2000 as Carter increasingly began to concentrate on his DJing career. Carter revived the Monkey Mafia name for a one-off single titled \"Royal Ascot\" in 2012."]}, {"page": "John Gosling (Psychic TV musician)", "response": ["In the mid-to-late-Nineties he was a core member of the group Agent Provocateur along with Matthew Ashman (originally of Bow Wow Wow), Dan Peppe, Danny Saber (of Black Grape) and Cleo Torez."]}, {"page": "Agent Provocateur (band)", "response": ["Agent Provocateur were a British electronica band, consisting of John Gosling, Matthew Ashman (Bow Wow Wow), Dan Peppe, Danny Saber (Black Grape) and Cleo Torez.Larkin, Colin (2000) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music, Virgin Books, , p. 261 When Ashman died in 1995 he was replaced on guitar by Lance Burman (formerly of Chiefs of Relief)."]}]}}
