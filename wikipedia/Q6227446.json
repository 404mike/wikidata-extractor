Guardian journalist John Crace wrote: \"By rights, Alan Partridge should have been dead as a character years ago, the last drops of humour long since wrung out ... but Steve Coogan keeps finding ways to make him feel fresh.\" The Independent wrote that Partridge was a \"disarming creation\" whom the audience root for despite his flaws. In the Guardian, critic Alexis Petridis wrote that audiences find Partridge funny partly because they recognise themselves in him, and Edmund Gordon called Partridge \"a magnificent comic creation: a monster of egotism and tastelessness\". According to Gordon, Partridge allows liberal audiences to laugh at politically incorrect humour as \"every loathsome comment is sold to us not as a gag, but as a gaffe\". Writing that Partridge \"channels the worst excesses of the privileged white man who considers himself nonetheless a victim\", New Statesman journalist Daniel Curtis saw Partridge as a precursor to \"post-truth\" politicians such as Nigel Farage and Donald Trump."]}, {"page": "David T.

These included ownership of an original, pre-GM Saab; camaraderie with other Saab drivers and contempt for other brands such as BMW. Writer John Crace characterised the typical \"Snaab\" as a creative advertising executive with large spectacles and an asymmetric hairstyle.  R\u00fcdiger Hossiep, a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum, found that Saab drivers have the highest level of psychological involvement with their cars, being over 10 times more passionate than the average Volkswagen driver.

It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened.\" The Los Angeles Times described this as a \"nifty little trick\", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book \"as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world.\" The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a \"neat trick of authorial self-abnegation\". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at \"his most ambitious\", a \"Philip Rothian, doppelg\u00e4nger gambit\", making his new narrator \"the real Clay\" and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, \"with writerly jujitsu\", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a \"milestone in a lot of ways\". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters \"still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies\". John Crace, in his \"digested read\" of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that \"the author\" of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as \"too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love.\" With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries \"Is it complication ... or is it clarification?\", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can \"guess [Bret Easton Ellis] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to.\" Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of \"self-consciousness as a device.\" This device was picked up on by several other critics\u2014in particular, Vice noted that \"the scatological violence of American Psycho\" and \"the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park\" had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the \"sequel\" question, commenting \"...\u00a0I don't think it is [a sequel]. Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure.

The closure, particularly of East Asian Studies, meet with opposition from the Foreign Office, Durham City Council and the Japan Foundation.

A 2003 article by John Crace, also written for The Guardian, suggested the reforms were driven by Durham not having 'high numbers of overseas or postgraduate students to augment the balance sheet', which influenced the selection of departments to be shut down \u2013 East Asian Studies students being comparatively more expensive to teach and limited in number, while the business school was apparently saved (despite then having one of the worst research ratings in the university) because it was one of the few parts of the university to attract any great number of overseas students."]}, {"page": "Great Ormond Street (TV series)", "response": ["John Crace of The Guardian said that the documentary \"exposed us to the existential questions that doctors face on a daily basis \u2013 and which most documentaries avoid\", while Andrew Billen of The Times called it \"extraordinarily frank\".
