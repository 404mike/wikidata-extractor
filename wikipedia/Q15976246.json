He also denounced anew the Earl of Danby. Parliament resumed the pursuit of Danby's impeachment, showing even more anger against him than its Cavalier Parliament predecessor had.John Bagford, Joseph Woodfall Ebsworth, The Bagford Ballads: Illustrating the Last Years of the Stuarts, vol. 2 (1878), p. 742"]}, {"page": "Ebsworth", "response": ["*Joseph Woodfall Ebsworth (1824\u20131908), English clergyman, editor of ballads, poet and artist"]}, {"page": "Many a true word is spoken in jest", "response": ["An early print appearance of the most familiar form of this aphorism was in Volume VII of the Roxburghe Ballads, where it appears in the prologue to The Merry Man's Resolution, or A London Frollick. The ballad purportedly goes back to the 17th century, but the introductory verse was probably written by the editor of the collection Joseph Woodfall Ebsworth:Joseph Woodfall Ebsworth, The Roxburghe Ballads, Volume VII, The Ballad Society, Hertford (1893)"]}, {"page": "A Ballad upon the Popish Plot", "response": ["This ballad is one of a group on the Popish Plot included in the Bagford Ballad collection, whose ballads depict the last years of the Stuart reign at the end of the 17th century. As the preface to the third volume of the collection describes, the value of ballads such as these is that they allow readers to \"follow [...] the varying emotions\" of \"the average men and women\" of the early modern era -- \"their joys, their griefs, their boastfulness, their anger\"\u2014as well as give a narrative of important social, political, and cultural events of the time. Thus this ballad, and the group of ballads of which it is a part, serve a valuable historical and cultural function not only as records or descriptions of significant past political events but also because they give readers access to the subjective quality of the lives of that era's common people. As Joseph Woodfall Ebsworth, the editor and annotator of the second division of the published Bagford Ballad collection, evocatively phrases it: \"Here, if we choose to pay attention, are clearly written the contemporary records of how men [and women] felt and spoke during the mad excitement, the servile terror, and the ferocious hatred of the days when clamours echoed against the so-called 'Popish Plot'\" (viii). By giving readers access to the inner lives of the common people, and especially that part of their inner lives that was emotionally engaged by tumultuous political events such as the Popish Plot, these ballads provide a counterweight to, or throw into relief, other ballads in the collection that merely depict the social life of the Stuart kings, thus enriching our contemporary understanding of the social and political dynamics of the era. They also serve as a relevant reminder\u2014and warning\u2014of the power religious bigotry can exercise over a general population when allowed to develop unchecked."]}]}}
