Before 1905, the senior British diplomat had different titles: (a) Consul-General and Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, which is a rank just below Ambassador.

The Provisional Association then applied to Queen Victoria for a royal charter, which was granted on 1 November 1881. William Hood Treacher was appointed as the first governor, and Kudat at the northern tip of Borneo was chosen as the Provisional Association administration capital.

He at various times during his career served as 'roving consul' for the British plenipotentiary in China for Great Britain, Rutherford Alcock. His duties in this capacity required a visit to explore Hainan, as well as a journey up the Yangtze River to Chungking, in Szechuan Province, to help determine steamship navigability of that river. All the while he was stationed at those various postings, he retained the Formosan consulship, and indeed did not relinquish it until his retirement from the service of his government, in 1873.  He spent his spare time in China collecting natural history specimens, and as the area had not previously been open to Westerners, many of the items he collected were new to science. As he was primarily an ornithologist, many of his new discoveries were birds, but he also found new fish, mammals and insects. He returned to England in 1862 with his collection. Many of the birds were first described in John Gould's Birds of Asia (1863)."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Japan", "response": ["|Sir Rutherford AlcockNussbaum, \"Alcock, Rutherford,\" ||\u00a01859||\u00a01864"]}, {"page": "Laurence Oliphant (author)", "response": ["In 1861, Oliphant was appointed First Secretary of the British Legation in Japan under Minister Plenipotentiary (later Sir) Rutherford Alcock.

His pistols having been locked in their travelling box, Oliphant rushed out with a hunting whip, and was attacked by a ronin with a heavy two-handed sword. A beam, invisible in the darkness, interfered with the blows, but Oliphant was severely wounded and sent on board ship to recover.

Rutherford Alcock was appointed Consul-General in Japan and selected T\u014dzen-ji to be used as the site of the British legation. It had been the policy of the Tokugawa Shogunate to commandeer temples for temporary use by foreign dignitaries, and Alcock felt that T\u014dzen-ji was of a suitable size and status. Japanese authorities were against the choice of Edo and advised Alcock to settle in Yokohama, especially as T\u014dzen-ji was located at the entrance to the T\u014dkaid\u014d, the busiest and most important highway in Japan, and was therefore exposed to possible attacks. Alcock would not be deterred and the British legation was opened in 1859. In January 1860, Kobayashi Denkichi, the native interpreter of Rutherford Alcock, was murdered at the gate of the legation by two r\u014dnin, foreshadowing further trouble which was to come.", "Of the three captured r\u014dnin, one was executed by beheading and two committed seppuku. Of those who escaped the battle, four were found at the Toraya inn (of whom one committed seppuku rather than surrender, two were captured and committed seppuku, and one was executed), two were later killed during the Sakashitamon incident and one at the Tench\u016bgumi incident, and two more were killed at other locations. Only two of the participants survived until after the Meiji restoration. Alcock, who had bitterly protested the presence of the Japanese guards as a nuisance and accused them of being nothing more than spies for the Shogunate finally realized the depth of anti-foreign sentiment. He threatened that he would use the attack as a casus belli unless the shogunate agreed to permit a British garrison to be stationed at the legation, the number of Japanese guards increased, and compensation of $10,000 to be paid. The shogunate was forced to concede to all of these demands. Even so, Alcock would later write in his memoirs that the Japanese guards assigned did nothing to fight the attackers and it was only by his own heroism and that of Morrison and Olipant that they were driven off - not mentioning the two dead and ten injured Japanese defenders. Sword cuts and bullet marks from the attack remain in the pillars of the main hall of the temple.Alcock, Rutherford. (1863).  The Capital of Tycoon, pp. 146-158.
