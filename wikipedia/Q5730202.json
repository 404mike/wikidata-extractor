On the road between Carura and Laodicea was the temple of Men Carus, a Carian deity; and in the time of Strabo there was a noted Herophilean school of medicine here, under the presidency of Zeuxis, and then Alexander Philalethes.Strabo, p. 580  Chandler discovered some remains on the road to Laodicea, which, he supposes, may be the traces of this temple; but he states nothing that confirms this conjecture."]}, {"page": "Henry Chandler", "response": ["* Henry William Chandler (1828\u20131889), English classical scholar"]}, {"page": "Henry William Chandle", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry William Chandler"]}, {"page": "List of Pembroke College, Oxford, people", "response": ["* Henry William Chandler, classical scholar, elected Fellow in 1853"]}]}}
