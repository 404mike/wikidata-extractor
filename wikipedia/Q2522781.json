He worked with Toyah Willcox from the late 1970s to 1983 as the guitar player in her eponymous band and was the co-writer on nearly all of the material they recorded. Bogen also produced Heaven, the 1997 debut album of neo soul artist Jai, for M&G and RCA Records.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Toyah Willcox", "response": ["In 1977, while playing Emma in Tales from the Vienna Woods at the National Theatre, Willcox, inspired by her role as a musician in Glitter, fronted a band called Toyah which featured Joel Bogen on guitar, Mark Henry on bass, Steve Bray on drums, Peter Bush on keyboards, and herself on vocals. Having never considered herself a musician, she found herself fronting a successful band, although still uncertain about her own sexuality and repelled by her bandmates' antics with groupies.", "In January 1981, the live album Toyah! Toyah! Toyah!, recorded at the Lafayette Club in Wolverhampton the previous June, made it to the Top 30, backed up by a TV documentary Toyah. By now the original band had broken up and a new lineup was in place, consisting of Phil Spalding, Nigel Glocker and Adrian Lee, only Joel Bogen remaining and Toyah. 1981 saw Willcox's strengthened presence in the charts with hits such as Four from Toyah EP (no. 4, February 1981, including \"It's a Mystery\"), the third album Anthem that went to no. 2 in May 1981 to be later certified platinum, \"I Want to Be Free\" (no. 8, June 1981), \"Thunder in the Mountains\" (no. 4, October 1981) and Four More from Toyah EP (no. 14, November 1981). She became one of the first acts to score regularly in the UK Singles Chart with EPs, which were also successful on an international level. At the end of the year Willcox won the Smash Hits' reader's poll in two categories: Best Female Singer and Most Fanciable Female (beating Kim Wilde to the second place). In 1981 she alone, according to Safari, sold in the UK more units than the whole of the Warner Bros. put together.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: "]}, {"page": "Bogen", "response": ["* Joel Bogen, English rock and punk guitarist who was the guitar player in the band Toyah"]}, {"page": "Sheep Farming in Barnet", "response": ["All songs by Toyah Willcox, Joel Bogen and Peter Bush, except where indicated.", "* Joel Bogen \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Toyah (band)", "response": ["Toyah was an English new wave band fronted by Toyah Willcox between 1977 and 1983.

First Toyah ended up in a punk band from Golders Green, which used to rehearse at Golders Green cemetery and even did a few gigs there.  It was Glen Marks, though, who in 1976 introduced Toyah to a protege who was at his school called Joel Bogen, whom she described later as \"a very accomplished musician\", by far the most accomplished musician that she had met at that time. With Bogen she struck up a writing partnership. In the beginning they met only on Sundays to write songs and answer ads from the NME. Then they joined with a keyboard player called Pete Bush who had a music room in his house in Totteridge where three of them could rehearse. Slowly the band came together \"from friends of friends of friends\".", "Now seeing Adrian Lee's keyboard duties taken over by newcomer Simon Darlow and Joel Bogen, the band recorded a much darker gothic album entitled The Changeling (1982).
