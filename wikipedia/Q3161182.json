According to family relatives, his great-grandfather James Jackson immigrated to France from England in 1812, one of many who came to France in the 19th Century to teach steel production methods. He achieved a distinction in mathematics and science, and served as an artillery officer during World War I before returning to the \u00c9cole centrale Paris in 1919, from which he graduated as Ing\u00e9nieur des Arts et Manufactures in 1921. He joined the Chemins de fer de Paris \u00e0 Lyon et \u00e0 la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e (PLM) as a probationer in the Rolling Stock and Motive Power section at Lyon-Mouche depot. However, foreseeing poor prospects, he left in 1924 and joined the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Industrielle des Telephones, soon becoming as assistant manager. In 1925, he joined the Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans (PO) and, along with Finnish Engineer Ky\u00f6sti Kyl\u00e4l\u00e4, jointly designed the Kylchap exhaust system.
