Prior to 1993, due to the growing battle with republicans it was felt that it needed to be an exclusively Australian body to defer criticisms that it was just an offshoot of a UK group; it severed its affiliation in 1993, and became an independent group, the Australian Monarchist League.  The separate Monarchist League of Australia replaced it as an affiliate in 2006.  The Monarchist League of New Zealand and the Monarchist League of Canada were founded independently of the London-based Monarchist League and had no formal affiliation; however the Canadian league was formed by John Aimers after he attended a 1969 tour of Canada by Lieut.-Col. J. C. du Parc Braham, chancellor of the London-based League. The Canadian League, was formed months later with du Parc Braham having given Aimers a list of 50 Canadian members of the British-based league. The Monarchist League remained in close contact with the Canadian group, and on 11 March 1989, Lord Nicholas Hervey had a long meeting at London's Savoy Hotel with Mr Aimers, then Chairman of the Monarchist League of Canada, in order to examine ways in which the two groups could co-operate more closely.The Monarchist League Newsletter, Spring, 1989, pp.\u00a04\u20135"]}, {"page": "Lady Victoria Hervey", "response": ["Lady Victoria is the eldest child of the 6th Marquess of Bristol and his third wife, Yvonne Marie Sutton, and was born on her father's 61st birthday, 6 October 1976.
