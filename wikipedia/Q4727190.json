She received a PhD from the London School of Economics in 1989. She wrote a trilogy of fantasy novels, set approximately in the time of Alexander the Great. In the novels, Alexander dies, and the female protagonist, Aleizon Ailix Ayndra, goes on to fulfil Alexander's destiny.\nIn 1989, Spedding moved to Bolivia and lectured at San Andres University in La Paz. While there she published the academic work Wachu Wachu. Cultivo de coca e identidad en los Yungas de la Paz (1994) and Kausachun-Coca (2004). She is the author of three novels in Spanish: Manuel y Fortunato. Una picaresca andina (1997), El viento de la cordillera (2001), and the sci-fi, anarcho-feminist novel De cuando en cuando Saturnina (2004). She is also the author of a book of short stories, El tiempo, la distancia, otros amantes (1994) and the play Un gato en el tejar, the latter published under the pseudonym Alicia C\u00e9spedes Ballet. In Bolivia she became an outspoken critic of the government's policy of cracking down on peasant coca farmers. In May 1998 her La Paz flat was raided and she was arrested on drugs charges, and sentenced to ten years in prison. Academics widely considered the arrest was politically motivated and campaigned for her release. She was released in 2000 on payment of a surety.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fantasy authors", "response": ["* Alison Spedding, (born 1962) author of The Road and the Hills"]}, {"page": "Spedding", "response": ["* Alison Spedding (born 1962), British anthropologist and fantasy author"]}, {"page": "List of women anthropologists", "response": ["| Alison Spedding"]}]}}
