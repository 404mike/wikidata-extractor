In June 1937 he joined Torquay United, making his debut in a 1\u20130 win at home to Swindon Town on 26 February 1938. He lost his place to his former Mosborough teammate Freddie Green after playing the next game, a 1\u20130 defeat away to Aldershot, but after missing just one game re-emerged as a left-back, replacing Ernie Stokes. He finished his first season as a professional having made 11 league appearances and began the following season as the regular left-back. However, after playing the first 13 league games, he lost his place and was to only make a further 3 first-team appearances that season.\nHis career was interrupted by the war, but when league football resumed he was still with Torquay and was the regular right-back in Torquay's 1946-47 side. He left Torquay in 1948, having made 77 league appearances, and joined non-league Yeovil Town. In 1949 he was part of the famous Yeovil side that reached the 5th Round of the FA Cup, beating then giants Sunderland, including England star Len Shackleton who Keeton kept quiet throughout the game, in the 4th Round.\nKeeton later worked as a commercial traveller in Torquay, and died of cancer in Torquay in January 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yeovil Town 2\u20131 Sunderland (1949)", "response": ["| MF || 4 || Bob Keeton"]}, {"page": "Keeton (surname)", "response": ["*Bob Keeton (1918\u20131996), English footballer"]}]}}
