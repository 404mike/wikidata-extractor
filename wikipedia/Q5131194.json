He played regularly from mid-January to April 1924 when, after an unexpected defeat at home to Port Vale put Nelson in increased danger of relegation, he lost his place to his namesake Bob Lilley.

Hooper played the first eight games of the campaign before losing his place to Ted Ferguson. After three months out of the side, he returned to the starting line-up for one final match, helping the team to a 1\u20130 win against Hartlepools United.

Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top goalscorer in each of the previous three seasons, was retained along with captain Clem Rigg, Welsh half-back Jack Newnes and goalkeeper Harry Abbott. The two most senior squad members, David Wilson and goalkeeper Joseph Birds, retired from professional football aged 40 and 36 respectively. Inside forward Dick Crawshaw, who had been the team's second-highest scorer in 1923\u201324 with five goals, moved to Stalybridge Celtic.Dykes (2009), p. 30 Scottish forward Mike McCulloch ended his two-year association with the club by joining Chesterfield on a free transfer, while half-back Leigh Collins signed for New Brighton. Other players, including William Lammus and Ernest Gillibrand, left Nelson having failed to establish themselves in the first-team during their time with the club.Dykes (2009), p. 37 Manager Wilson spent a total of \u00a3750 (\u00a3 as of 2011) on new players in the summer of 1924. Billy Bottrill and Bill Ellerington arrived from Middlesbrough, while Barrow full-back James Phizacklea was signed to bolster the defensive line.Dykes (2009), p. 58 Several young players were acquired from local non-League football during the close season, including Ambrose Harris from Briercliffe and Billy Harper, formerly of Feniscowles. The Nelson squad was considered by the local newspaper to be stronger than the one which had won the Third Division North two seasons earlier.", "In the first game of December, Nelson failed to win at Seedhill for the first time in the season. Despite a tenth goal of the campaign from Eddleston and a penalty kick scored by captain Clem Rigg, the team could only draw with Bradford Park Avenue. After a two-week break from League football because of the FA Cup, Nelson returned to action with a 4\u20131 home win over Rotherham County in the only match ever played between the two sides at Seedhill. On Christmas Day, half-back Ambrose Harris made his first appearance for Nelson as the side beat Chesterfield 1\u20130 thanks to Bill Ellerington's first goal for the club. The same team was defeated by the same scoreline the following day in the reverse fixture at Saltergate. Inside forward Arthur Wolstenholme scored the only goal of the match as Nelson recorded their first away victory of the season in the final fixture of 1924.", "Nelson started the new year with a 1\u20131 draw at Ashington; Ellerington scored for the second time in three matches but it was cancelled out by a goal from Bill Watson. A week later, half-back Ernie Braidwood netted his first of the season as the team secured another 1\u20131 draw away at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground. In the first home match of the new year, on 17 January 1925, Nelson atoned for their defeat to Accrington Stanley earlier in the season with a 4\u20131 win thanks to two goals from Eddleston, one from Chadwick, and a first goal in almost three months for Cameron. Clem Rigg scored two penalties the following week as the side beat Barrow to move above Bradford Park Avenue into fifth position in the Third Division North. On 7 February Nelson won their third consecutive home fixture, beating Tranmere Rovers by four goals to one. Left-half Herbert Butterworth made his senior debut for the club against Tranmere, despite signing from Wolverhampton Wanderers almost two years previously,Dykes (2009), p. 25 while Chadwick scored twice in one game for the first time. A trip to Walsall seven days later brought a first away victory of 1925 for the team as goals from Chadwick and Hoad gave Nelson a 2\u20131 win, which elevated them to third place in the league. A narrow win against Wigan Borough at Seedhill on 21 February lifted Nelson further up the table into second position, behind only Darlington. The team ended a successful February with a fourth victory of the month, beating Halifax Town 4\u20132 before a crowd of 10,000 spectators at The Shay.", "The team scored a total of 88 goals in all competitions. The highest scorer was Eddleston, with 26 goals, followed by Chadwick, who scored 10 goals in 20 outings.

In April 1925, Pearson joined Football League Third Division North side Nelson, initially as an amateur, although he was offered a professional contract in September of the same year. He made his debut for Nelson on 3 October 1925 in the 0\u20131 defeat away at Coventry City and appeared in the following five matches, but then spent the majority of the 1925\u201326 season in the reserve team. During the 1926\u201327 campaign, Pearson was more involved in first-team activities and appeared in more than half of Nelson's league fixtures, although he was never able to properly displace club captain Clem Rigg from the left-back berth. He returned to the reserves for the 1927\u201328 season, making only seven senior appearances. Following a disappointing campaign in which the team finished bottom of the division, Nelson retained only six of their professional squad in the summer of 1928, and Pearson was one of several players to leave the club."]}]}}
