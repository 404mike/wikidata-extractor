On 23 March 2007, at Nottingham Arena, Graham defeated Booth via knockout in the tenth-round to secure the Midlands Area welterweight title. As Booth boxed well early on, Gethin, a crude pressure fighter, threw lots of punches, though Booth jabbed and moved, with him ultimately winning the first three rounds fairly comfortably. As the rounds wore on, Gethin began to make his pressure pay a little more, particularly with his overhand right, which kept catching Booth due to his low left hand. Booth boxed with the style of the Ingle gym, but it began to cost him, as he was caught with the right several times. Both began to tire, but Gethin's higher workrate began to tell, winning him rounds and, eventually, the tenth-round knockout win. Booth never saw the punch coming, a big right hand, and was out before he hit the floor. On 14 November, Booth was scheduled to face Kreshnik Qato on the undercard of Darren Barker and Ben Crampton for the vacant Commonwealth middleweight title at York Hall, however, the fight was cancelled. Another two losses followed: close points decisions over British fighters Chris Black (5-2-1) and Matthew Hall (16-1-0) in a 6-round and 8-round match, respectively.
