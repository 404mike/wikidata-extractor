He was part of Derry's first ever All-Ireland Senior Football Championship winning side in 1993 and also won two Ulster Senior Football Championships and four National League titles. He also had a distinguished under-age career with the county - winning Ulster Under 21, Ulster Minor and All-Ireland Minor Championship medals. Burns still plays club football with St Colm's Ballinascreen.\nHe usually plays in the half forward line. Burns had massive promise at underage level, and won a vast range of honours by the time he was 21, however some feel he never reached his true potential on the inter-county stage. He was also hampered by injury throughout his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derry Senior Football Championship", "response": ["| \u00c9amonn Burns (2-24)"]}, {"page": "Ballinascreen GAC", "response": ["*\u00c9amonn Burns - 1 1993 All-Ireland Championship, 2 Ulster Senior Football Championship, 1 All-Ireland Minor Football Championship, 4 National Football Leagues."]}, {"page": "1972 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*24 January \u2013 \u00c9amonn Burns, Gaelic footballer."]}, {"page": "Burns (surname)", "response": ["*\u00c9amonn Burns (born 1972), Irish Gaelic footballer", "*\u00c9amonn Burns (Down Gaelic footballer) (1963\u20132019), Irish Gaelic footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Eamon Burns", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c9amonn Burns"]}, {"page": "Eamonn Burns", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c9amonn Burns"]}, {"page": "\u00c9amon Burns", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c9amonn Burns"]}, {"page": "Dermot McNicholl", "response": ["McNicholl was in the United States for a short period the early 1990s and while there played with St Columbkille's GFC, Boston.
