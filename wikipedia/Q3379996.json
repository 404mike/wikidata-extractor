He notably played in the Premier League for Queens Park Rangers, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers and West Ham United, although he failed to make an appearance for the latter. He also played in the Football League with Hereford United and Wolverhampton Wanderers and prior to his professional career had played at non-league level for Newport County.\nFrom 2013 to 2015, he was the manager of Northern Premier League Division One North club Lancaster City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["|1996|| Darren Peacock"]}, {"page": "Kevin Keegan", "response": ["Newcastle excelled in the first half of the 1995\u201396 season, going ten points ahead on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2\u20130 defeat at West Ham United on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of fellow title challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March, and within two weeks Newcastle's lead was overhauled and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's 4\u20133 defeat to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered to be one of the classic Premier League games. With two games remaining Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle only got one point in a 1\u20131 drawn match against Nottingham Forest on 2 May, and with a 1\u20131 draw for Newcastle against Tottenham Hotspur on the final day of the season on 5 May, the title was won by Manchester United, whose 3\u20130 triumph at Middlesbrough would have won them the title regardless of Newcastle's result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle United had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as Les Ferdinand, Darren Peacock, David Ginola, Peter Beardsley, Faustino Asprilla and Rob Lee would have stayed together, may have built up a momentum, and won more trophies."]}, {"page": "Steve Harper", "response": ["On 11 September 2013, Newcastle honoured Harper for his 20 years at the club with a Testimonial against an A.C.
