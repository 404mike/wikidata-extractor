The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art. London, UK: George G. Harrap & Co. Ltd., 14. This was the hostile environment in which Pre-Raphaelites were defiantly working in various media. The Pre-Raphaelites attempted to revitalize subject painting, which had been dismissed as artificial. Their belief that each picture should tell a story was an important step for the unification of painting and literature (eventually deemed the Sister Arts), or at least a break in the rigid hierarchy promoted by writers like Robert Buchanan."]}, {"page": "Aestheticism", "response": ["Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, James McNeill Whistler, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Albert Joseph Moore, GF Watts and Aubrey Beardsley.

Although Browning took a firm personal line against homosexuality, masturbation and any other sexual practices, he maintained a series of romantic friendships with boys. He had favourites, who were often replaced with a brutal suddenness when they lost their appeal. Sometimes, one of these would accompany him on his regular European trips during the summer holidays, as did Gerald Balfour, the future prime minister's brother, in 1869.   Although this type of close, even affectionate master-boy relationship was considered generally acceptable in Victorian public school life,  Browning's flamboyance and mannerisms were contrary to Hornby's vision for the school; Anstruther writes: \"The mere sight of Oscar Browning with his pale face and effeminate manner was enough in itself to make Hornby suspicious\". Furthermore, Browning's friendship with the artist Simeon Solomon was widely known. Solomon, like Browning, was an advocate of \"Greek love\", a concept derived from Plato's Dialogues which held that the highest form of love was that of men for each other, exclusive of physical expression. The two holidayed together, and Solomon was a frequent visitor to Eton \u2013 he exchanged with Browning a series of intimate letters in which they mutually extolled the beauties of various boys.   In February 1873 Solomon was convicted of an act of gross indecency in a London public lavatory \u2013 a consensual act of sodomy with a mature working-class male was far from the ideals of Greek love, and Browning ended the relationship with Solomon immediately."]}]}}
