Believing at first he is a fraud, Anne soon discovered he was an actual psychic only with a damaged ability. Alan explained that his ability had manifested itself around puberty, but he couldn't control it and it wrecked much of his youth because people thought he was mentally ill. He eventually became a stage performer, using his ability to help ghosts though he felt bitter about it at the time as he felt his ability had taken over his life. One day he had an accident on stage injuring his head and damaging his ability to hear most ghosts (he could communicate with Annie due to her strong presence). Annie asks him why he doesn't just quit since he got what he wanted in the accident. Alan admits the irony of the matter being that he came to see his ability as a part of him and he lost a part of himself when it went away. With Annie's help he is able to help the numerous ghosts that have been following him for weeks since he came to town.
