Linda Grant suffered accusations of plagiarism following her award in 2000, while the following year, a panel of male critics produced their own shortlist and heavily criticised the genuine shortlist. Though full of praise for the winner of the 2007 prize, the chair of the judging panel Muriel Gray decried the fact that the shortlist had to be whittled down from \"a lot of dross\", while former editor of The Times Simon Jenkins called it \"sexist\". In 2008, writer Tim Lott called the award \"a sexist con-trick\" and said, \"the Orange Prize is sexist and discriminatory, and it should be shunned\".", "|Ayobami Adebayo, Stay With MeLinda Grant, The Dark CircleC.
