He is Professor Emeritus of the Economics of the City at University College London where in the 1980s he was Director for eight years of the Development Planning Unit at The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment. He is also a senior policy consultant to the  think tank, the European Policy Centre, in Brussels, on the subject of international migration.\nHe earned his B.A. and M.A., both in philosophy, politics and economics at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1959 and 1962 respectively, and his Ph.D. (thesis: The Economic and Industrial Policy of the British Conservative Party, 1945\u20131964), in 1963, at the London School of Economics.\nHarris was, for a time, a leading member of the British Socialist Workers Party and edited their publication International Socialism.\nIn recent years he has done a considerable amount of work for the World Bank. Harris' greatest public prominence in the UK has been though his advocacy and defence of immigration in such works as Thinking the Unthinkable: The Immigration Myth Exposed (2001) and he is currently a member of the RSA's Migration Commission.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Duncan Hallas", "response": ["*Why Import Controls Won't Save Jobs with Nigel Harris, (SWP pamphlet, 1981)"]}, {"page": "The Bartlett", "response": ["* Nigel Harris, Emeritus Professor of the Economy of the City"]}, {"page": "Nigel Harris", "response": ["Nigel Harris may refer to:", "*Nigel Harris (actor) (born 1949), British actor", "*Nigel Harris (American football) (born 1994), American football player", "*Nigel Harris (economist) (born 1935), British economist", "*Nigel MacArthur, British broadcaster under the pseudonym Nigel Harris"]}, {"page": "Bill Warren (communist)", "response": ["Some commentators have likened Warren's ideas on capitalism, particularly his belief that the creation of a global market is required for the creation of a Communist society, to other thinkers, such as the Revolutionary Communist Party and Nigel Harris.For criticism of Warren's views, see "]}, {"page": "Socialist Workers Party (UK)", "response": ["Other IS/SWP theoreticians such as Nigel Harris and Chris Harman would later extend and develop a distinct body of state capitalist analysis based on Cliff's initial work. This theory was summed up in the slogan \"Neither Washington nor Moscow, but International Socialism\". The slogan is said to have originally come from Max Shachtman's group, the Workers Party, in their paper 'Labor Action' and was only borrowed by the IS/SWP at a later date. This is seen as ironic because one of Cliff's concerns when first developing his idea of state capitalism was to differentiate his ideas from the idea of bureaucratic collectivism associated with Shachtman (see for example The Theory of Bureaucratic Collectivism: A Critique (1948)).Tony Cliff: The theory of bureaucratic collectivism: A critique (1948) (accessed 29 May 2008) However, the formula also echoes the Fourth International's 1948 manifesto, Neither Wall Street nor the Kremlin. Cliff's version of the theory of state capitalism can be differentiated from those associated with other dissident Trotskyists and Marxists, such as C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya.", "Cliff's essay \"Permanent Revolution\" was first published in International Socialism Journal, No. 12 Spring 1963,Tony Cliff: \"Permanent Revolution\", International Socialism (1st series), No. 12, Spring 1963 (accessed 2008-95-29) in response to the Cuban Revolution and largely took it and the earlier Chinese Revolution as its subject. However, the general concept of a deflected permanent revolution would be much exercised as a key analytical tool by IS theoreticians in the coming years. Significant in this respect is the work of Nigel Harris in relation to India and later of Mike Gonzalez on CubaPeter Bins & Mike Gonzalez: \"Castro, Cuba and Socialism\", International Socialism 2:8, Spring 1980 (accessed 29 May 2008) and Nicaragua. The theory has been given a central place in Cem Uzun's work Making the Turkish Revolution (2004).", "The three theories taken together are often seen as being the hallmarks of the IS tradition, although this is contested by some former leaders of the IS, including Nigel Harris and Michael Kidron both of whom worked on the PAE and now repudiate it, and by some other Trotskyists outside the IS Tradition. The PAE, the most contested of the three theories, is also the only one that did not originate with Tony Cliff.", "In his May 1957 article \"Perspectives of the Permanent War Economy\",Tony Cliff: \"Perspectives of the Permanent War Economy\", Socialist Review, May 1957 (accessed 29 May 2008) Cliff offered the PAE to readers in a version derived from Sard's earlier essays but without reference to Keynes and using a Marxist theoretical framework. This was the only attempt to develop the idea, which it is suggested explains the long post war boom, until the publication of Mike Kidron's Western Capitalism Since the WarMichael Kidron: Western Capitalism Since the War, Penguin (1968) (accessed 29 May 2008) in 1968. Kidron would further develop the theory in his Capitalism and Theory. Additional work was also contributed by Nigel Harris and later by Chris Harman. However it should also be noted that Mike Kidron was to repudiate the theory as early as the mid-1970s in his essay \"Two Insights Don't Make a Theory\"Michael Kidron: \"Two Insights Don't Make a Theory\", International Socialism (1st series), No. 100, July 1977 (accessed 29 May 2008) in International Socialism No. 100.

It then retained links with comrades coming out of that group and with other individuals in the international Trotskyist movement. But there was no significant growth in support for its ideas until the late 1960s. Some of the ideas of the IST, such as the permanent arms economy were originally developed from writings published by the ISL. The theory of the permanent arms economy was developed by T. N. Vance in a series published throughout 1951 in the ISL journal New International and was later refined by Cliff in the late 1950s and over the years by key International Socialist (IS) theoreticians such as Mike Kidron, Nigel Harris and Chris Harman in later years."]}, {"page": "International Socialism (magazine)", "response": ["The current journal is the second series following an earlier series which ran from 1960 to 1978 publishing a total of 104 issues. Originally edited by Michael Kidron for its first five years, with Alasdair MacIntyre co-editing it alongside him for 18 months, subsequently the first series was variously edited by Nigel Harris, Chris Harman, Duncan Hallas and Alex Callinicos. The second series was originally edited by Peter Binns, who was succeeded as editor by John Rees. Previously, a single issue of a duplicated journal of this name had been published in 1958 and the first edition of Tony Cliff's essay on Rosa Luxemburg was published, in book form, as issue 2/3 in series with this otherwise one-off publication."]}]}}
