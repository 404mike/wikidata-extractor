He was the lead singer, rhythm guitarist and main songwriter for the Kinks, which he led with his younger brother, Dave. He has also acted, directed and produced shows for theatre and television. He is often referred to as \"the godfather of Britpop\", though he disputes it. After the dissolution of the Kinks in 1996, Davies embarked on a solo career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bela Lugosi", "response": ["Lugosi's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is mentioned in \"Celluloid Heroes\", a song performed by The Kinks and written by their lead vocalist and principal songwriter, Ray Davies.

A line in \"Lola\" by the Kinks was originally recorded as \"You drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola.\" When the British Broadcasting Corporation refused to play the song because of the commercial reference, lead singer Ray Davies re-recorded the lyric as \"it tastes just like cherry cola\" to get airplay for the song."]}, {"page": "Concept album", "response": ["Other records have been claimed as \"early\" or \"first\" concept albums. The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time (2015) states that the Ventures \"pioneered the idea of the rock concept album years before the genre is generally acknowledged to have been born\" with their 1964 album The Ventures in Space. Another is the Beach Boys' Little Deuce Coupe (1963). Writing in 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music, Chris Smith commented: \"Though albums such as Frank Sinatra's 1955 In the Wee Small Hours and Marty Robbins' 1959 Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs had already introduced concept albums, Little Deuce Coupe was the first to comprise almost all original material rather than standard covers.\" Writing in his Concise Dictionary of Popular Culture, Marcel Danesi identifies the Beatles' Rubber Soul (1965) and the Who's The Who Sell Out (1967) as other examples of early concept albums. Brian Boyd of The Irish Times names the Kinks' Face to Face (1966) as the first concept album: \"Written entirely by Ray Davies, the songs were supposed to be linked by pieces of music, so that the album would play without gaps, but the record company baulked at such radicalism. It\u2019s not one of the band\u2019s finest works, but it did have an impact.\""]}, {"page": "Charles Mingus", "response": ["* 1991, Ray Davies produced a documentary entitled Weird Nightmare.

Waiting for the Sun became their first and only album to reach Number 1 on the US charts, and the single \"Hello, I Love You\" (one of the six songs performed by the band on their 1965 Aura Records demo) was their second US No. 1 single. Following the 1968 release of \"Hello, I Love You\", the publisher of the Kinks' 1964 hit \"All Day and All of the Night\" announced they were planning legal action against the Doors for copyright infringement; however, songwriter Ray Davies ultimately chose not to sue. Kinks guitarist Dave Davies was particularly irritated by the similarity. In concert, Morrison was occasionally dismissive of the song, leaving the vocals to Manzarek, as can be seen in the documentary The Doors Are Open."]}, {"page": "XTC", "response": ["Discussing the recording of the Mummer track \"Ladybird\", Partridge recalled that he told producer Steve Nye that he was afraid people would think he was copying the Beatles, to which Nye's response was \"Who gives a fuck?\" Partridge said that \"from that moment onward, I started to recognise that those songwriters\u2014the Ray Davieses, the Lennons and McCartneys, the Brian Wilsons\u2014had gone into my head really deeply. He later considered \"Rook\" (1992), \"Wrapped in Grey\" (1992) and \"Easter Theatre\" (1999) to be the \"perfect songs\" of his career, feeling that he had \"exorcized a lot of those kind of Lennon-and-McCartney, Bacharach-and-David, Brian Wilson type ghosts out of my system by doing all that.\"  Reportedly, when Brian Wilson was played the Dukes' \"Pale and Precious\", a pastiche of the Beach Boys, he thought it was styled after Paul McCartney.", "XTC are noted for their \"Englishness\". Partridge denied that this was conscious on his part: \"I don't try to be English. I guess because I am English, it comes out English. But I don't sit down and think, \"Cor blimey, can I put a union jack and a beefeater's outfit on, Mary?\" British music critic John Harris identified Partridge's XTC compositions as within the same \"lineage\" of rural English songwriting invented by Ray Davies of the Kinks, and followed by the Jam, the Specials, \"scores of half-forgotten punk and new wave bands,\" the Smiths and mid 1990s Britpop. In Partridge's opinion, the band \"never got beyond Swindon.\" He also felt that XTC being described as \"pastoral\" was a compliment: \"'Pastoral' to me means being more in touch with the country than the city, which I think we are. London gives me the willies.\" Lyrically, he cited Ray Davies, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney as his biggest influences."]}, {"page": "1944", "response": ["** Ray Davies, English rock-singer and songwriter, co-founder of The Kinks"]}, {"page": "Madness (band)", "response": ["In June 2011, the band performed at Meltdown Festival at the Royal Festival Hall, curated by inspiration Ray Davies, who also introduced the band on stage.

Davies's multi-faceted music, McAnuff's directing, and the acting were well received, with the show winning the \"Best Musical\" award from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle."]}, {"page": "Britpop", "response": ["Though Britpop is seen retrospectively as a marketing tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common. Britpop bands show elements from the British pop music of the 1960s, glam rock and punk rock of the 1970s, and indie pop of the 1980s in their music, attitude, and clothing. Specific influences vary: Blur drew from the Kinks and early Pink Floyd, Oasis took inspiration from the Beatles, and Elastica had a fondness for arty punk rock, notably Wire. Regardless, Britpop artists project a sense of reverence for British pop sounds of the past. The Kinks' Ray Davies and XTC's Andy Partridge are sometimes advanced as the \"godfathers\" or \"grandfathers\" of Britpop, though Davies disputes it."]}, {"page": "Rudolph Valentino", "response": ["* \"Celluloid Heroes\", written by Ray Davies and performed by The Kinks in 1972"]}, {"page": "River Thames", "response": ["Two songs by the Kinks feature the Thames as the setting of the first song's title and, for the second song, arguably in its mention of 'the river': \"Waterloo Sunset\" is about a couple's meetings on Waterloo Bridge, London and starts: \"Dirty old river, must you keep rolling, flowing into the night?\" and continues \"Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station\" and \"...but Terry and Julie cross over the river where they feel safe and sound...\". \"See My Friends\" continually refers to the singer's friends \"playing 'cross the river\" instead of the girl who \"just left\".

Rubber Soul similarly inspired Pete Townshend of the Who and the Kinks' Ray Davies, as well as Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, who issued their first album of all-original material, Aftermath, in April 1966. John Cale recalled that Rubber Soul was an inspiration as he and Lou Reed developed their band the Velvet Underground.

November 1979 saw the release of the Setting Sons album, another UK hit, and their first chart entry in the US, albeit at 137 on the Billboard 200. The album began life as a concept albumThat's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam p. 131 about three childhood friends, though in the end many of the songs did not relate to this theme. Many of the songs had political overtones; \"The Eton Rifles\" was inspired by skirmishes between demonstrators on a Right to Work March \u2013 a campaign initiated by the left-wing Socialist Workers Party \u2013 and pupils from Eton College; \"Little Boy Soldiers\" was an anti-war multi-movement piece in the vein of Ray Davies. Another notable song from the album was Bruce Foxton's \"Smithers-Jones\", originally a b-side to \"When You're Young\".
