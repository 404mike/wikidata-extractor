Bruce-Mitford was tasked with watching the site during the excavation. Much of his work involved waiting for the well in front of each house to be dug out, revealing two or three feet of mud at the bottom, filled with broken medieval pottery and other artefacts. He would wait \"impotently\", he later recalled, for the jaws of the mechanical diggers (which would not wait for the archaeologists) to pick up the mud and transfer it to a lorry; he would then jump aboard, and pick out the artefacts as the lorry made its way \"to some gravel hungry site at Cumnor\". When back at the Ashmolean he would wash the sherds and stick them together. Bruce-Mitford's \"energy and keen eye captured a treasure chest\", the archaeologist Maureen Mellor wrote four decades later. Because the wells would quickly silt up and be replaced by new ones every 50 or so years, Bruce-Mitford found it possible to accurately date pottery within uniquely short time-frames. In 1939, he published an article on the finds, in which he described, among other things, five distinct groups of pottery in their probable chronological order; his brother Alaric provided the illustrations. This was \"the first serious study of medieval pottery\", wrote Mellor, and \"has never had to be challenged, although refined and extended\". Bruce-Mitford's work also influenced him, decades later, to create a national reference collection of medieval pottery at the British Museum."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| William Joscelyn Arkell||20/03/1947||9 June 1904 \u2013 18 April 1958"]}, {"page": "Mary Clark Thompson Medal", "response": ["William Joscelyn Arkell (1944)"]}, {"page": "Arkell Cirque", "response": ["Arkell Cirque () is a large cirque on the south face of the central Read Mountains, Shackleton Range.
