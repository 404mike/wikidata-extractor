He made his competitive debut in Arsenal's first league match of the 1894-95 Second Division campaign, away to Lincoln City on 1 September 1894; he scored but Arsenal lost 5\u20132. Despite his youth (he was only 19), he proved himself that season as a regular goalscoring forward and finished that season as Woolwich Arsenal's top scorer, with 14 goals in 22 games.\nThe next season, Mortimer generally played at left half rather than up front, and thus scored fewer goals; he still bagged nine that season, including a hat-trick in a 7\u20130 defeat of Crewe Alexandra. However, at the end of the 1895-96 season he was transferred to Chatham for unknown \"political\" reasons. In all he played 49 first-class matches for Arsenal and scored 23 goals. After leaving football he worked as a railway carriage painter and ironmonger. He died in 1951 at the age of 76.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Buchanan (footballer, born 1867)", "response": ["In September 1894 he moved to join Woolwich Arsenal, for 1894\u201395, their second season in the Football League Second Division.
