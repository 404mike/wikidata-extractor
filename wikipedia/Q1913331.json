After a near-death experience in motocross he eventually turned to acting. After some lesser supporting roles in famous British soap operas and a resident personality on a popular 1990s British game show, The Price is Right, he landed a role in the Jet Li action film Kiss of the Dragon. His performance led to other opportunities such as co-starring with Steven Seagal as the main villain in The Foreigner as well as appearing in Sean Connery's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Later roles include a villain in Jason Statham's Death Race and a supporting role in Sex and the City 2.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Wheel of Time", "response": ["In February 2015, Red Eagle Entertainment paid air time to cable network FXX to air Winter Dragon, a  low-budget 22-minute pilot for a potential The Wheel of Time series that allowed Red Eagle to hold on to the rights to the series. The pilot, based on the prologue to The Eye of the World, starred Max Ryan as Lews Therin Thelamon and Billy Zane as Ishamael and aired after Midnight with no announcements or publicity. Harriet McDougal initially stated she was unaware of the show ahead of time, and that the film rights to The Wheel of Time were set to revert to the Bandersnatch Group, her company, a few days later on 11 February 2015. Her comments triggered a slander lawsuit with Red Eagle, which was ultimately dismissed during settlement talks that July. In an interview with io9, Red Eagle Entertainment's CEO Rick Selvage stated \"it was more of an [issue of] getting it on the air.\"  A spokesman for FXX stated that the channel was paid to air the show, but Selvage hinted that it was indeed produced with a future series in mind. \"We think there's huge demand for the television series internationally, and we're looking forward to producing it and getting it out in the marketplace.\""]}, {"page": "2001 in film", "response": ["| Kiss of the Dragon || 20th Century Fox || Chris Nahon (director); Luc Besson, Robert Mark Kamen (screenplay); Jet Li, Bridget Fonda, Tch\u00e9ky Karyo, Max Ryan, Ric Young, Burt Kwouk, Kentaro, Laurence Ashley, Cyril Raffaelli, Didier Azoulay, John Forgeham, Paul Barrett, Colin Prince, Vincent Glo, Vincent Wong || Martial Arts || Live action"]}, {"page": "2003 in film", "response": ["| The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen || 20th Century Fox || Stephen Norrington (director); James Dale Robinson (screenplay); Sean Connery, Naseeruddin Shah, Peta Wilson, Tony Curran, Stuart Townsend, Shane West, Jason Flemyng, Richard Roxburgh, Max Ryan, Tom Goodman-Hill, David Hemmings, Terry O'Neill || Action, Fantasy || || Live Action"]}, {"page": "Kiss of the Dragon", "response": ["* Max Ryan as Lupo"]}, {"page": "The Foreigner (2003 film)", "response": ["His task is to take a mysterious package from France to a wealthy man in Germany.
