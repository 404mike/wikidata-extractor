The 14th century Vedic commentator Sayana states the Taittiriya Samhita (6.2.4) elaborates the Rigveda version. However, the Rigveda does not hint at the classical legend of the rescue of the earth by the boar. In the scripture, the god Rudra is called the \"boar of the sky\". Even Vishnu is described to have slew a boar. The hunt of a boar using dogs is also referred to."]}, {"page": "Ribhus", "response": ["Bal Gangadhar Tilak then interpreted also in 1893 the Period of twelve days as the twelve intercalary days,The Orion, p.168 f. to fix the difference between the lunar year of 354 days and the solar year of 366 days.Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History Vol.1, p. 51 While he interpreted the beginning of the year at the vernal equinox, Arthur Anthony Macdonell 1917 stated that the twelve intercalary days \"in all probability\" were inserted at the winter solstice.Dates and Eras in Ancient Indian History Vol.1, p.76, Note 86, referring to A.A.
