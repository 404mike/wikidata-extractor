Following incidents in the Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment.Chalke and Hodgson, pp. 111\u201312. Both Jim McConnon, Laker's replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial choices for the 1954\u201355 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton;Chalke and Hodgson, p. 128. neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required.Woodcock, p. 54. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton found it hard to talk to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals.Marshall, pp. 160\u201361. On the other hand, Hutton played a key role in the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success.Marshall, p. 160. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954\u201355 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour."]}, {"page": "Burnopfield", "response": ["Cricket has long been a popular sport in the village \u2013 it has been played at two small cricket grounds.

Both grounds were built upon land  given to the clubs by the National Coal Board. The Burnopfield Club produced two Test cricketers for England, both of whom played before Durham County Cricket Club took part in the county championship; Jim McConnon, who played for Glamorgan, and Colin Milburn, the \"Burnopfield Basher\", who played for Northamptonshire.

The most likely explanation is that these outspoken cricketers were regarded as 'difficult tourists' by the MCC and Hutton thought that \"Fiery Fred\" had yet to mature as a bowler.p129, Fred Trueman, As It Was, Pan Books, 2004. As in every series since the war it looked like the England bowling would rest on the broad shoulders of Alec Bedser (24.89)\u2014in 1954 his 231 wickets was the greatest haul in Test history. His lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters had taken 30 wickets (at 16.06) on the 1950\u201351 tour and 39 wickets (at 17.48) in 1953. The unfortunate Bedser suffered from shingles, had seven catches dropped off him in the First Test, where he was hit for 1/131, was dropped and never got back into the side. He took to bowling to the Australian team in the nets and Keith Miller told him \"You're not too bad for a Test discard. If you want a game you can come over and play with us\".p59, Keith Miller, Cricket Crossfire, Oldbourne Press, 1956 In the last four Tests Hutton relied on the formidable bowling attack of Frank Tyson (18.76), Brian Statham (24.84), Trevor Bailey (29.21), Johnny Wardle (20.39) and Bob Appleyard (17.87). While \"Typhoon\" Tyson is justly famed for simply blasting the opposition away, the nagging accuracy of Statham and Bailey and the increasing spin of Wardle and Appleyard all served to tie down and frustrate the Australian batsmen. In fact the spinners took wickets with a faster strike rate (1 wicket every 57 balls) and at a lower average (21.57) than the fast bowlers. Like Simpson the fast swing bowler Peter Loader (22.51) thought that he should have played in the Tests and was unlucky not to do so. Big Jim McConnon also had a bad tour, he was never really seen as an adequate alternative for Jim Laker, didn't find his form and was sent home early after a couple of painful injuries. Bill Edrich had opened the England bowling before the war, but rarely bowled in the 1950s. Len Hutton, Tom Graveney and Colin Cowdrey were part-time leg-spinners who were only really used in up-country games.", "|Jim McConnon || Glamorgan || 31 || Off-spin bowler || 2 || 18 || 11 || 9.00 ||  || || 4 ||  || 4 || 3/19 || 18.50 ||  || "]}, {"page": "1951 English cricket season", "response": [" || Jim McConnon ||align=\"right\"| 5176 ||align=\"right\"| 238 ||align=\"right\"| 2186 ||align=\"right\"| 136 || 16.07"]}, {"page": "Len Muncer", "response": ["In 1953, his bowling was hampered by injury, and Jim McConnon became the county's main off-spin bowler.

Pakistan started their reply well, but the rain-affected pitch favoured the bowlers. Pakistan lost wickets rapidly, with Johnny Wardle taking four for 19 and Jim McConnon, on his debut, three for 19 and four catches.

He cut loose in the occasional run chase, hitting five sixes off Jim McConnon at Swansea in the 1958 season and five more at Lord's in the 1961 season. In the 1963 season, he became county captain but, with their fast bowler Les Jackson in decline, he had little ammunition to work with.

In those days the MCC saw tours as a means of encouraging overseas cricket and strengthening the ties that bound the Commonwealth. Lord Cobham gave a speech in which he reminded the team that it was more important to not disgrace the face of English cricket even at the cost of series, though several young players had other ideas about this.p6, Tyson The party was a large one of 18 players, Denis Compton suffered a recurrence of his knee trouble which had plagued him on the 1950-51 tour and required remedial surgery. Yorkshire's \"Farmer Vic\" Wilson was a surprise choice as his replacement and Compton was later flown out to join the team in Australia. The other 17 were seen off by family, friends and well-wishers on the Orsava. Frank Tyson saw \"a spare, stooped old man, dressed immaculately in a pin-stripe suit\" telling the young Colin Cowdrey, \"when you reach Australia, just remember one thing - hate the bastards!\". He spoke with such vehemence that Tyson asked George Duckworth who the old gent was, \"That was Douglas Jardine\", the reason behind Lord Cobham's speech on good sportsmanship. They travelled first class on the Orsova, which took six weeks to arrive in Western Australia, after stopping for a one-day game against Ceylon. Unused to the lavish fare and freed of rationing, the players soon added weight and Frank Tyson increased his weight from 161 lbs (73\u00a0kg) to 182\u00a0lbs (83\u00a0kg).p12, Tyson Unfortunately for the Australians he exercised regularly so the extra weight was turned into muscle. Soon after the voyage began Vic Wilson, Colin Cowdrey, Peter Loader, Jim McConnon, Keith Andrew and Frank Tyson were warned by Len Hutton that they were secondary players who were expected to play little part in the Test matches.p23 and p252, Tyson", "The tourists arrived in Fremantle on 7 October and Cowdrey learnt by telegram that his father had died, but he decided to continue the tour. Four days later played their first match of a long tour against a local Country XI on a small, sandy ground 20 yards from the beach. The A.C.B. liked these games as they encouraged grassroots cricket. They were less popular with the tourists as they involved travelling to distant grounds to play in front of small crowds. However, one or two of these games were useful at the beginning of the tour to allow the players to warm up and Bunbury was close enough to Fremantle and Perth for hundreds to come and see the game. The Country teams could sometime surprise the opposition, and this team included three first-class players, including spinners Morgan Herbert and Eric James, both players for Tambellup\u2013Cranbrook. Hutton won the toss and the MCC belted 344/5 in less than a day with Hutton (59), Edrich (129), Graveney (58) and Cowdrey (48 not out) entertaining the crowd. A declaration before stumps saw no Country wickets fall and 51 was added for the first wicket, but then Big Jim McConnon's off-spin worked its way through the middle order as he took 5/30 after Peter Loader (4/35) and Tyson (1/35) removed the openers and the home side were all out for 116. Put back in again they survived the day, and the match, at 128/6 with Colin Cowdrey's good natured leg-spin taking 4/35. Tyson ploughed up the sand on his long run up and could not bowl at full pace and was described by one reporter as a zephyr rather than a typhoon.p89-90, Swanton, 1977p45-47, Tyson", "This was the last match before the First Test on the same ground and was played in stifling heat and humidity. Peter May captained again to give Hutton a rest. Ron Archer, captain of Queensland (the brother of the Australian all-rounder Ken Archer) won the toss and put the MCC in to bat on a good wicket. Reg Simpson opened with 136, but again only two batsman did anything as Denis Compton added 110 runs and everybody else 56. The tourists were 18/3 before the 234 run Simpson-Compton partnership and collapsed from 252/4 to 304 all out thereafter. Ray Lindwall took 4/66, but had to retire because of gastric trouble. Strangely every batsman in the Queensland team except the absent Lindwall got into double figures, but none of them made fifty and they were out for 288. Mick Harvey made 49 and thrashed a ball into Jim McConnon's groin, a painful injury that put the unlucky spinner out of contention for weeks. Alex Bedser still had his unexplained rash, but bowled 31 eight ball overs for 2/56 and Brian Statham and Trevor Bailey both took 3/74. The MCC made 288 as well in their second innings despite being 8/2 when the makeshift opener Colin Cowdrey and wicket-keeper Keith Andrew batting at number 3 were out for ducks. Simpson made 38, but it was May (77), Compton (69) and Bailey (51 not out) who made the runs as no bowler took more than 2 wickets. There was no time to consider a run chase, but Simpson surprised everybody when his off-spinners took 2/5 to leave Queensland on 25/2.90-97, Tyson", "The MCC played the Northern Districts of New South Wales in a three-day match which did not count as First Class even though the team was as strong as some state sides. Len Hutton, Frank Tyson and Brian Statham took a rest after the exhausting Second Test and Peter May led the side. The Northern Districts batted first and Ron Harvey made 41 to take the score to 85/4. Robert MacDonald (63) batted through the lower order, but they collapsed to Johnny Wardle's lethal mix of left-arm orthodox spin, Slow left-arm wrist-spin and reverse googlies as he took 6/36 and the home side fell from 192/5 to 211 all out. The MCC batted to 438, their highest score of the tour so far with Jim McConnon, having recovered from his injury, making 43 as an opener, Denis Compton 60, Peter May a majestic 157 and wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans 69. batting again the home team did better with 246 with seven batsmen getting to double figures, but the medium paced off-spin of Bob Appleyard (5/59) took their toll with the in-swingers and leg-cutters of Alec Bedser (3/49) helping out. The MCC made the 20 runs needed to win for the loss of makeshift opener Godfrey Evans and won by 9 wickets.", "Some of the oldest grade clubs in Australia are in Tasmania, but it was a weak state side that did not fully complete in the Sheffield Shield for another twenty years. Richie Benaud, Alan Davidson, Les Favell and Neil Harvey were flown out to help the Tasmanian team in another Combined XI. Thanks to the Third Test a record 20,000 spectators turned out on the small Hobart ground to watch. The Tasmanian captain Emerson Rodwell won the toss and batted only to see Favell out for a duck, thanks to Alec Bedser (3/56) as the ball swung heavily. Peter Loader (4/81) took two more wickets and Benaud was caught off \"Big Al\" to leave them 72/4, but Harvey (82) and Rodwell (72) added 60 before Trevor Bailey (3/29) reduced 132/4 to 146/7. Rodwell added another 54 runs with Terence Cowley (12) before Bailey caught him off Bedser, Loader took the last two wickets and the Combined XI were out for 221. This looked good as the tourists now fell to the swing bowling of Alan Davidson (4/45) as they collapsed to 167/7 with Denis Compton making 46. Bailey stuck around for 53 and Bedser took the score up to 242 with 19. The Combined XI batted again, but waited until they were 184/6 before Rodwell declared, with Neil Harvey 47 and Richie Benaud 68 not out. The unlucky Jim McConnon broke his little finger when fielding a powerful Harvey on-drive, as it would take until the end of the tour to mend he was sent home when they reached the mainland. The MCC had an hour and forty minutes to make 164 for victory so Hutton sent Keith Andrew to open, but he was soon out and Reg Simpson (37 not out) and Vic Wilson (33 not out) together at the end on 99/2.p159-163, Tyson"]}, {"page": "McConnon", "response": ["*Jim McConnon (1922\u20132003), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Jim McConnon (1950\u20131961) : J.
