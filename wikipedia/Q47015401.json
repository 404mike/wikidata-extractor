Its development occurred following a collaboration between Orthopaedic Surgeon Robin Ling and University of Exeter engineer Clive Lee and it was first implanted at the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital in Exeter in 1970. The Exeter Hip is a cemented device, but with a slightly different stem geometry. Both designs have shown excellent long-term durability when properly placed and are still widely used in slightly modified versions."]}, {"page": "Robin Ling", "response": ["Robin Sydney Mackwood Ling,  (7 September 1927 \u2013 9 October 2017) was an English surgeon who invented the Exeter hip system, a hip replacement. As an orthopaedic surgeon at the Princess Elizabeth orthopaedic hospital, Exeter, he co-operated with an engineer, Dr. Clive Lee from the University of Exeter, to develop a new hip replacement. Their work led to improved quality of life for millions of people.", "Ling's ambition was to create a hip replacement that could be secured to bony skeleton with acrylic bone cement. Through extensive laboratory analyses of modified hip implants, Ling and engineer Dr Clive Lee built on the work of Sir John Charnley to demonstrate that over a period of time, bone cement can undergo \"creep\" and act as a thick liquid. This mechanism permits the transmitting weight through the joint to the skeleton and allows patients to remain pain free and active for years."]}, {"page": "Clive Lee (engineer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Clive Lee"]}, {"page": "2021 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Clive Lee, design engineer (Exeter hip) (b. 1939).
