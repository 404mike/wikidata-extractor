Names similar to Bhutanincluding Bottanthis, Bottan, Bottanterbegan to appear in Europe around the 1580s. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier's 1676 Six Voyages is the first to record the name Boutan. However, in every case, these seem to have been describing not modern Bhutan but the Kingdom of Tibet. The modern distinction between the two did not begin until well into George Bogle's 1774 expeditionrealizing the differences between the two regions, cultures, and states, his final report to the East India Company formally proposed labeling the Druk Desi's kingdom as \"Boutan\" and the Panchen Lama's as \"Tibet\". Subsequently, the EIC's surveyor general James Rennell first anglicized the French name as Bootan and then popularized the distinction between it and greater Tibet.\"History of Bhutan: How Europe heard about Bhutan \". Kuensel. 24 August 2003. Retrieved 28 September 2011. The name is traditionally taken to be a transcription of the Sanskrit Bho\u1e6da-anta (, \"end of Tibet\"), in reference to Bhutan's position as the southern extremity of the Tibetan plateau and culture. \"Bhutan\" may have been truncated from this or been taken from the Nepali name Bhut\u0101n (\u092d\u0942\u091f\u093e\u0928). It may also come from a truncation of Bodo Hathan (\"Tibetan place\"). All of these ultimately derive from the Tibetan endonym Bod. An alternate theory derives it from the Sanskrit Bhu-Utthan (, \"highlands\")."]}, {"page": "Warren Hastings", "response": [":He got quickly to work, beginning the process of turning the EIC into an administrative service. Hastings first major change was to move all of all the functions of government from Murshidabad to Calcutta.... Throughout 1773, Hastings worked with extraordinary energy. He unified currency systems, ordered the codification of Hindu laws and digests of Muslim law books, reformed the tax and customs system, fixed land revenue and stopped the worst oppression being carried out on behalf of private traders by the local agents. He created an efficient postal service, backed a proper cartographic survey of India by James Rennell and built a series of public granaries, including the great Gola at Patna, to make sure the famine of 1770-71 was never repeated.... Underlying all Hastings' work was a deep respect for the land he had lived in since his teens.... Hastings genuinely liked India, and by the time he became Governor spoke not only good Bengali and Urdu but also fluent court and literary Persian.William Dalrymple, The Anarchy: The East India Company, Corporate Violence, and the Pillage of an Empire, 2019, pp. 238\u2013239."]}, {"page": "1830 in literature", "response": ["*March 29 \u2013 James Rennell, English historian and oceanographer (born 1742)"]}, {"page": "List of geographers", "response": ["*James Rennell (England, 1742\u20131830)"]}, {"page": "Adam's Bridge", "response": ["Due to shallow waters, Adam's Bridge presents a formidable hindrance to navigation through the Palk Strait.
