The historian Malcolm Airs, in his study The Tudor and Jacobean Country House: A Building History, considers the replacement of the private castle by the country house as \"the seat of power and the centre of hospitality\" to be \"one of the great achievements of the Tudor age\". Subsequent changes in court fashion saw the emergence of Elizabethan architecture among the elite, who built what are now called prodigy houses in a distinctive version of Renaissance architecture.Summerson, Chapter 1 to 4 cover this period; this brief summary is rather over-simplified.  Elizabeth I herself built almost nothing, her father having left over 50 palaces and houses.Summerson, 23 Outside court circles styles were much more slow-moving, and essentially \"Tudor\" buildings continued to be built, eventually merging into a general English vernacular style."]}]}}
