He joined Burnley on a free transfer in July 1991, and helped the \"Clarets\" to win the Fourth Division title in 1991\u201392.

For the first time in thirty two years, Vale were in the Second Division. A new club record was set in January 1989, as Rudge purchased classy defender Dean Glover from Middlesbrough for \u00a3200,000. The next month he added Liverpool winger John Jeffers to the squad for \u00a335,000, using the money he received from selling Steve Harper to Preston North End. To boost the side for the oncoming 1989\u201390 season, defender Neil Aspin was purchased from Leeds United for \u00a3150,000, Aspin would play over 300 games for Vale in the next ten years. \u00a3125,000 was splashed out on striker Nicky Cross, who would play around 150 games over the next five years. Vale fans were not used to such purchases, but compared to other teams in the division, the money spent was quite modest.

To fund the transfer Rudge sold Steve Harper to Preston North End for \u00a335,000. He featured in 15 Third Division games in the 1988\u201389 season, and featured in all four play-off games, including both legs of the play-off final victory over Bristol Rovers.

A weak defensive performance then cost them at home to Chester City, though Rudge was happy with the performance of Simon Mills, a midfielder who was learning a new position at right-back. A disciplined performance was enough to win a point away at Bury, with goalkeeper Mark Grew in impressive form. With Atkinson injured and Steve Harper out of form, Rudge tried unsuccessfully to bring in Liverpool's Steve Staunton and Bournemouth's Mark O'Connor on loan.

Rudge refused Reading's offer of \u00a3250,000 for Dean Glover, but placed Hazell on the transfer list.

Ahead of the Football League Trophy visit to York City in January 2001, McMahon agreed with manager Gary Bennett's suggestion that he had not been at his best; he responded by producing a run that forced a York defender to bring him down for a penalty kick, and then, collecting the ball from a throw-in with his back to goal on the edge of York's penalty area, he \"turned and sent a left-foot curler past the outstretched hand\" of the goalkeeper for Darlington's third goal.
