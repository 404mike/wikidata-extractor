Her work is known for her use of colour and floral and curvature lines using gemstones in motifs. She was predominantly active during the 1930s.Nossiter was educated at the Municipal School of Art in Birmingham from 1910 to 1914. Nossiter married Ernest Guy Robinson in 1922. By 1935 she was living in London where her work was shown in the \"Art by Four Women\" exhibition at Walker's Gallery, London. Nossiter would go on to exhibit there from 1935 to 1939.\nNossiter's work is often confused with that of another female jeweller and jewellery designer of the same period, Sibyl Dunlop.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nossiter", "response": ["*Dorrie Nossiter   British Jewelry designer"]}, {"page": "List of Birmingham City University people", "response": ["*Dorrie Nossiter"]}, {"page": "List of jewellery designers", "response": ["* Dorrie Nossiter"]}, {"page": "Sibyl Dunlop", "response": ["Dunlop was born in Hampstead, London to Scottish parents and finished her schooling in Brussels, where she became interested in jewellery design and underwent some basic training. She established a workshop and shop at 69 Kensington Church Street, London W8, and in the early 1920s was joined by W. Nathanson as her principal craftsman.  Dunlop's work is characterised by the use of semi-precious and precious gems, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, moonstone, amethyst, agate, quartz and opals, often cabochon rather than facet-cut gemstones, set in silver in symmetrical patterns, often inspired by nature. One of her most famous designs is the 'Carpet of Gems' symmetrical setting. The gemstones were cut for Dunlop by lapidaries in Germany. Dunlop's work is often confused with that of another female jewellery designer of the same period, Dorrie Nossiter. The business closed at the outbreak of World War II in 1939 and Dunlop never returned to work due to ill health. After the war Nathanson re-started the business and continued producing jewellery and silver under Dunlop's name until he retired in 1971."]}, {"page": "Dorrie", "response": ["* Dorrie Nossiter (1893\u20131977), English jeweller and jewellery designer"]}]}}
