That adjective describes the melodies of Enya\" whose \"art becomes the sum of its parts \u2013 as light as a whisper, yet as strong as a scream\". He compared her methods to English singer Claire Hamill but \"much better\", and praised her personal songs like \"On Your Shore\" to invite the listener to recall homes of their past, \"a bittersweet journey\". While the instrumental tracks to him are \"simple and pleasant musical ideas\", they are overshadowed by her vocal tracks, as \"Her singing is so strong that it is painfully obvious when she isn't\".
