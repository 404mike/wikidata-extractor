For example, an astonishing 835 people lived in 15 houses in Henrietta Street's Georgian tenements. At number 10, Henrietta Street, the Irish Sisters of Charity ran a laundry inhabited by more than 50 single women. An estimated four million pledges were taken in pawnbrokers every year. The infant mortality rate among the poor was 142 per 1,000 births, extraordinarily high for a European city. The situation was made considerably worse by the high rate of disease in the slums, which was the result of a lack of health care and cramped living conditions, among other things. The most prevalent disease in the Dublin slums at this time was tuberculosis (TB), which spread through tenements very quickly and caused many deaths amongst the poor. A report, published in 1912, found that TB-related deaths in Ireland were 50% higher than in England or Scotland. The vast majority of TB-related deaths in Ireland occurred among the poorer classes.

In his post as Medical Officer for Guinness, Lumsden was asked to provide first-aid classes for employees at the brewery; these classes became so popular that it was felt appropriate to establish a dedicated unit of the Brigade at the brewery.See also the account of Sir John Lumsden's life at http://www.earlscliffe.com/Former_residents.htm In 1905 the idea of the first public division came about following the Burgh Quay Disaster. This division was called the City of Dublin Ambulance Division, the first unit open to members of the public for membership. In 1909, women were allowed to join the ranks with the formation of the first nursing division, City of Dublin Nursing Division. Miss Eileen Blandford joined the Brigade in 1913 and in 1914 became District Secretary, working closely with Dr John Lumsden. In 1918, after war service in France, she was awarded the rank of Serving Sister of the Order of St John.

Lord Iveagh also made donations to St Patrick's Cathedral and created the St Patrick's Park gardens in 1901 between the cathedral and the Iveagh Trust buildings.

However, initially the Guinness board were reluctant to finance one. St James's Gate F.C. was the most prominent member of the union; however, by the early 1920s the membership had almost doubled and its activities had expanded to include tennis, cricket and handball branches. In 1926 St James's Gate Rugby Football Club was founded and 1928 saw the arrival of St James's Gate Hockey Club. This expansion highlighted the need for a permanent home base. In 1922 a twenty-five-acre site on the Crumlin Road owned by a Mr. Begg was identified as a possible candidate. Begg had been offered \u00a35,000 by the Dolphin's Barn Brick Company but he eventually sold the site to Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh because \"he did not like the idea of having a quarry in front of his house\".
