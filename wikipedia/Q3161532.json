He was dropped to the under-18s team but after injuries struck Saints, Eastmond was called on to fill in. He had to play under difficult circumstances, with Saints fans booing him with every touch of the ball. Despite this, he made a decent return. In July 2011 he successfully made the switch from the halfbacks to fullback, scoring 2 tries against Wakefield Trinity on 9 July. After that, Eastmond regained his confidence and was playing in a similar way to the 2008-09 seasons. He managed 15 appearances and scored 5 tries, but his workload was reduced to just 4 goal kicks (3 missed kicks), due to Jamie Foster replacing him as the club's kicker."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford Bulls records and statistics", "response": ["| 8 || 119 ||  Jamie Foster || 2013\u20132014"]}, {"page": "List of St Helens R.F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"  |Jamie Foster"]}, {"page": "Man of Steel Awards", "response": ["| Jamie Foster"]}, {"page": "Super League", "response": ["|2011||align=left| Jamie Foster||330||  St. Helens"]}, {"page": "Jamie Foster (Rugby League)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jamie Foster "]}, {"page": "2010 Widnes Vikings season", "response": ["Saint's arrived at the Stobart Stadium with plenty of players who are expecting to see first team action in this year's Super League campaign, with Saints imposing an early 22 point lead after four unanswered tries from Gary Wheeler, Jamie Foster, Sia Soliola and Bryn Hargreaves and 3 conversions from Jamie Foster."]}, {"page": "2011 Bradford Bulls season", "response": ["The Bulls travelled to the Capital to face fellow strugglers Harlequins RL; this was a must win for the Bulls if they wanted to keep within touching distance of the playoffs.

After tries from Ryan Hoffman, Harrison Hansen and George Carmont combined with two disallowed Saints efforts from James Roby and Michael Shenton, the game looked dead and buried at 16-0 to Wigan; with the auld enemy on top in terms of field position, defense, kicking and handling. However, Saints forged a comeback through a rare missed tackle from an otherwise outstanding Wigan defense when Roby put Jon Wilkin away under the posts, bettered by the boot of Jamie Foster. The energy levels visibly went up, and Tony Puletua powered through the Wigan line and somehow grounded the ball with a mass of bodies surrounding him, again Foster good with the goal. It took Saints another five minutes-a period in which Wigan looked threatening once more-to get their draw, with a forward-looking pass from Jonny Lomax finding Francis Meli in space out on the touchline, Foster about three yards wide with what would have been the game clinching kick. Wigan's Sam Tomkins and Saints scrum-half Kyle Eastmond exchanged failed drop-goal attempts late on as both sides settled on a point each in the game of the day at the Magic Weekend.", "The unpredictability of Saints this season was once again on show as they beat a Leeds side in a similar man-power situation to Saints. Added to the significance of the win was that scrum-half Kyle Eastmond was internally suspended for a serious breach of club discipline, so inexperienced halves Lee Gaskell and Jonny Lomax had to step up to the fore. The game started in ferocious style, both defences repelling each other, before Jamie Foster squeezed in at the left corner and converted his own try to give Saints the lead on 27 minutes. Leeds hit back five minutes before the break when Ryan hall scored, Kevin Sinfield kicking the goal for 6-6 at the break. It was Leeds who broke the second half deadlock with a very controversial try. The ball from Kallum Watkins to eventual scorer Zak Hardaker appeared to go yards forward, but, after reference to the video referee, the try, which came about form fine handling from Hardaker, was awarded. This decision only spurred Saints on, and, after a towering bomb from Gaskell, Michael Shenton dotted down, Foster again kicking the two for 12-10. The lead again switched hands when Paul McShane nudged over from dummy-half, Sinfield making it 16-12, but St Helens managed to find something that had seemingly escaped them hitherto; heart. Francis Meli barged past Watkins after a good ball from Scott Moore, before Paul Wellens timed his running line to perfection to latch onto a Gaskell pass. Foster converted both for 24-16. At this point the points were rapped up, despite Leeds' best efforts in reply. But the best, most exhilarating piece of football was still to come, when Meli flicked the ball out to the left wing, Foster caught the ball behind his back, switched it between his hands to score in the tightest of circumstances. To make matters better and put the proverbial icing on the cake of victory for Saints, Foster maintained his perfect kicking display with another goal from the touchline.", "For the first time in the season, St Helens showed some signs of consistency, with a comfortable win over a plucky Bradford outfit. It was the Bulls who made the better start though, with Shaun Ainscough latching onto a Marc Herbert kick, Patrick Ah van converting. Saints hit back in controversial fashion, with Paul Wellens' forward-looking pass falling into the arms of Jamie Foster, who squeezed in at the left-hand corner. Foster missed the goal, but made no mistake after Wellens crashed over. Three tries shared between Wellens, Chris Flannery and Foster in a blistering spell in which Paul Sykes was sin-binned effectively sealed the result, before Ah Van and Ainscough grabbed consolation efforts for the Bulls when Saints were down to 11 men through yellow cards.", "Saints extended their winning run to three games with a routine win over Hull KR. It was the Rovers who started the better though, with Kris Welham scoring on 10 minutes. However, the Saints hit back in typical fashion, Sia Soliola getting his first try for the club. In similar style, Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook scored his first for the club since his winter move from Harlequins, before scoring an almost carbon copy of his first minutes later, with Jamie Foster's boot giving St Helens an 18-6 advantage. And Ade Gardner's break gave Paul Wellens the opportunity to scorch in unopposed; 24-6 at half time.  Foster himself, so often the points machine with the boot, got on the try list with his fifth in three games, missing the conversion. On his 200th appearance, James Graham crashed over, before consolation efforts from the Robins from Welham and Jake Webster gave the scoreline a somewhat undeserved credibility.", "Although St Helens' fantastic form continued in this win over the 'Cru', Saints were guilty of taking their foot off the gas after half-time, and not capitalising on a scrappy display for the Welsh outfit in the second period. Young half-back combination Jonny Lomax and Lee Gaskell, assisted by the on-fire James Roby sent Saints on their way, with Jamie Foster's kicking giving them a 12-0 lead early on. After a brief spell of Crusaders pressure, Paul Wellens took a grubber from Gaskell to score Saints' third of the evening, before Gareth Thomas gave Crusaders a bit of hope. However, Saints wrapped up the win before half time, with two further tries, Roby himself and Ade Gardner crossing to give St Helens a 30-6 lead at the break. The impressive Tony Martin and Lloyd White gave Crusaders a sight at a fightback but Gardner's second on the full-time siren ensured the win for Saints.", "St Helens produced their most dominant game of the season, with a resounding 9-try-to-1 win over Wakefield. The game started off in tight fashion, with Saints' pressure being cancelled out by some rugged if plucky Wildcats defence. However, the deadlock was broken on 17 minutes, with Paul Wellens' long ball finding the in-form Jamie Foster out wide who crossed and scored a goal. Jonny Lomax jinked his way through before Jon Wilkin found a gaping hole in the Wakefield defence to set up Foster, who cantered over for his second, and the floodgates were well and truly open. Michael Shenton crossed before half time, before Chris Dean, a former Saints player sped 60 meters on an intercept to give Wakefield a glimmer of hope. However, Ade Gardner went over 7 minutes later, and tries from Gary Wheeler, Wellens, Tony Puletua and Tom Makinson completed the rout.", "St Helens' run came to an end in somewhat unfair circumstances after a classic with rivals Wigan. An injury ravaged Saints led 10-0 after 35 minutes through Michael Shenton and Jamie Foster scores. But Wigan hit back close to half-time, with Josh Charnley crossing in the right corner. Tries from Pat Richards (2) and another from Charnley put Wigan ahead for the first time in the game as they sought to dominate. And at 22-10, a youthful Saints side could have been forgiven for giving up, but in typical fashion, they hit back quickly, with Foster's second and Tom Makinson getting his second try in as many games dragging them back on terms. And Saints looked to have won the game, with Foster's boot from a thirty-yard penalty giving them a 24-22 lead with 7 minutes to play. However, Wigan won it through a last minute try from Liam Farrell, after a great delayed pass from Paul Deacon. An undeserved defeat, but a heartening display gave the game some credibility from Saints' perspective."]}, {"page": "Jamie Foster (rugby league)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jamie Foster"]}, {"page": "2011 Super League Grand Final", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"|  Jamie Foster"]}, {"page": "Engage Mutual Charity Man of the Match Award", "response": ["**Jamie Foster (St Helens) - donated to Japanese Earthquake Appeal"]}, {"page": "2012 Bradford Bulls season", "response": ["The Bulls started off March with a very impressive performance against league leaders Warrington Wolves, the Bulls were the better side for the majority of the game with John Bateman and Manase Manuokafoa both impressing however they could not prevent a controversial 23\u201310 loss with Matt Diskin and Jason Crookes scoring and Jarrod Sammut kicking a goal.

Bradford got their first home win against a St. Helens side struggling for form, however it was no easy task as the Bulls and Saints players ran their blood to water but the Bulls defence stood firm and they ground out a 12\u20138 win (their first win over Saints since 2009) with Elliott Whitehead crossing for an 8-point try after Jamie Foster kicked him and early in the second half Karl Pryce crossed for a try, returning Paul Sykes kicked 2 from 3.
