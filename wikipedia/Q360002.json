He has more than forty feature film credits between 1956 and 2008. Clark directed eight features and short films. Among his most recognized films are Midnight Cowboy (1969, as creative consultant), Marathon Man (1976), The Killing Fields (1984), and Vera Drake (2004). In 2011, Clark published Dream Repairman: Adventures in Film Editing, a memoir of his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Enya", "response": ["Morris assisted Enya in the production of a demo tape, playing additional keyboards to her compositions, which Roma thought would suit accompanying visuals and sent it to various film producers. Among them was David Puttnam, who liked the tape and offered Enya to compose the soundtrack to his upcoming romantic comedy film, The Frog Prince (1984). Enya scored nine pieces for the film but they were later rearranged and orchestrated against her wishes by Richard Myhill, except for two that she sang on, \"The Frog Prince\" and \"Dreams\"; the words to the latter were penned by Charlie McGettigan. Film editor Jim Clark said the rearrangements were necessary as Enya found it difficult to compose to picture. Released in 1985, the album is the first commercial release that credits her as Enya, after Nicky Ryan thought \"Eithne\" would be too difficult for non-Irish people to pronounce correctly and suggested the phonetic spelling of her name. Enya looked back on the film as a good career move, but a disappointing one as \"we weren't part of it at the end\". She then sang on three tracks on Ordinary Man (1985) by Christy Moore."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Film Editing", "response": ["| Jim Clark", "| Jim Clark", "*1: Jim Clark (2)"]}, {"page": "James Clark", "response": ["* Jim Clark (criminal) (1902\u20131974), American bank robber and Depression-era outlaw", "* Jim Clark (film editor) (1931\u20132016), editor of The Killing Fields", "* Jim Clark (Alaska official) (born 1943), former chief of staff to Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski", "* Jim Clark (Australian politician) (1891\u20131963), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "* Jim Clark (infielder) (1927\u20131990), American baseball infielder", "* Jim Clark (outfielder, born 1887) (1887\u20131969), American baseball outfielder", "* Jim Clark (outfielder, born 1947) (1947\u20132019), American baseball outfielder", "* Jim Clark (offensive lineman) (1929\u20132000), American football player", "* Jim Clark (American football coach) (born, c. 1926), American football coach", "* Jim Clark (Australian footballer) (1925\u20132013), in the Victorian Football League", "* Jim Clark (Scottish footballer) (1923\u20131994), Scottish footballer", "* Jim Clark (rugby league) (fl. 1913\u20131927), a New Zealand rugby league player", "* Jim Clark (1936\u20131968), Scottish Formula one world drivers' champion in the 1960s", "* Jim Clark (rower) (born 1950), British rower", "* Jim Clark (ice hockey) (born 1954), director of scouting for the Ottawa Senators", "* Jim Clark (sheriff) (James Gardner Clark, Jr., 1922\u20132007), Dallas County, Alabama sheriff"]}, {"page": "American International Pictures", "response": ["| align=\"right\"| May 22, 1974 || Madhouse || Horror || Jim Clark"]}, {"page": "The Mission (1986 film)", "response": ["| Jim Clark", "| Jim Clark", "| Jim Clark"]}, {"page": "The Killing Fields (film)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\"| Jim Clark", "| Jim Clark"]}, {"page": "Jack Clayton", "response": ["Following the success of his feature debut, Clayton was offered many prestige projects, but he rejected all of them, later commenting that he felt that they were \"carbon copies\" of Room at the Top.

An alternative interpretation was offered by film editor Jim Clark, who would work with Clayton on his next two films \u2013 he claimed that \"Clayton's inability to make a decision was legendary\" and that this was why he took so long to decide on his next film.Jim Clark, Dream Repairman: Adventures in Film Editing (Landmarc Press, 2010), Ch. 4", "Although film editor Jim Clark recalled the production as a largely happy experience, it marked the end of his working relationship with Clayton. After a screening at Cannes, Clayton decided to cut five minutes from the film and although Clark objected, Clayton eventually took most of the footage from the pivotal scene in which Anne Bancroft's character has a breakdown in the middle of Harrods. Clark privately confided his misgivings to Clayton's assistant Jeanie Sims, but later suspected that Sims might have told Clayton, because after Clark had started work on his next movie he received a vitriolic letter, apparently from Clayton, who blamed Clark for the failure of the film, and claimed that he had \"never been behind the project\" \u2013 although Clark suspected the letter might not have been written by Clayton at all, since it was typed and Clayton \"never used a typewriter\".Jim Clark, Dream Repairman: Adventures in Film Editing (Landmarc Press, 2010), Chapter 5", "Former colleague Jim Clark was given his major break by Clayton, who hired him as the editor on The Innocents.
