The plot's previous owner, Moxhay, had agreed upon a covenant not to erect buildings but the law would not allow buyers who were not \"privy\" to the initial contract to be bound by subsequent promises. The judge, Lord Cottenham, decided that future owners of land could be bound by promises to abstain from activity, subject to the doctrine of notice (actual or constructive). Otherwise, a buyer could (re-)sell land to himself to undermine an initial promise.Tulk v. Moxhay (1848) 41 ER 1143 (Court Rolls) James Wyld bought the assets of the garden from the Tulk and Moxhay's death estates in 1849 to erect the Great Globe, though buried the statue of George I under 12\u00a0feet of earth with the globe stuck on top. The statue was uncovered following the globe's demise, but by 1866 it had deteriorated due to vandalism and was sold for \u00a316. Arguments continued about the fate of the garden, with Charles Augustus Tulk's heirs erecting a wooden hoarding around the property in 1873. These were quickly removed after the Master of the Rolls ordered that the land must be preserved for its original purpose."]}, {"page": "Poole (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Charles Augustus Tulk"]}, {"page": "Sudbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Charles Augustus Tulk"]}, {"page": "Wyld's Great Globe", "response": ["Wyld made an agreement with the owner of the gardens, Pheobe Moxhay, to acquire the freehold for \u00a33,000, but the Tulk family, who owned the buildings on three sides of the square and already had a judgement against Moxhay's late husband, Edward Moxhay, would have been able to prevent Wyld building. They used this hold over him to negotiate a favourable deal for themselves: they would allow Wyld to use the land for ten years from 25 April 1851, after which he would remove any buildings that he had erected within six months, and each branch of the Tulk family would have a one-year option to buy half the land for \u00a3500.The Tulk family had bought part of the Leicester Square estate around 1758 and by an agreement in 1807 John Augustus Tulk had divided the estate with his eldest son Charles Augustus Tulk. Although Wyld and the Tulks attempted to negotiate with the owner of the buildings on the north side of the square, Henry Webb, they were not able to reach an agreement, and they eventually signed the contract without his assent. When Wyld began to prepare the site, Webb announced his intention to take out an injunction to prevent the building work proceeding. Wyld restarted negotiations with Webb and eventually (in July 1851, over a month after the building had been completed) Webb agreed to allow the ten-year agreement with the Tulks to stand."]}, {"page": "Augustus H.

Hence arose the controversy between \"resuscitationists\" and \"dissipationists\"; John Clowes and Robert Hindmarsh rejected Noble's view, and his major antagonist was William Mason (1790\u20131863).

Elms subsequently sold to Robert Barren, who later sold to John Inderwick. When Moxhay bought the gardens in 1839 he was an established speculative builder, so clearly had development in mind, and being unable to remove this restrictive covenant chose to ignore it. After four years of legal wrangling, in 1848 Moxhay paid Barren's widow \u00a3120 to release Inderwick from the covenant and the freehold of the garden was finally conveyed by Inderwick to Moxhay without any obligation to maintain it or even to keep it \"uncovered with any buildings\". Moxhay immediately started felling the square's trees and in October 1848 Charles Augustus Tulk, whose folly in selling the garden for \u00a3210 forty years earlier was the main cause of this deplorable state of affairs, sought an injunction in Chancery to restrain Moxhay from despoiling the square or building on the garden. Moxhay argued that nearby development had made the square \"entirely dependent for its prosperity upon trade and commerce\" and that the residents no longer used the garden, which had become an unsightly disgrace to the neighbourhood, though he admitted that he had considered erecting a bazaar in the garden as early as 1845. In December 1848 the Master of the Rolls made an order restraining Moxhay from using the garden in any way which \"might be inconsistent with the use of it as an open garden and pleasure ground\", and this decision was subsequently upheld by the Lord Chancellor. This legal decision, Tulk v Moxhay, has become a landmark case in establishing that covenants bind subsequent owners of land.'Leicester Square Area: Leicester Estate', in Survey of London: Volumes 33 and 34, St Anne Soho, ed.
