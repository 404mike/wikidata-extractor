Five years later he founded a major Atlantic steamship line that significantly improved conditions for immigrant passengers fleeing Ireland after the Great Famine. He also founded Richardson Fertilizer Limited that remained in business under its original name until 2002.Richardson was the second of ten children of James Nicholson Richardson (1782\u20131847), a wealthy Quaker linen merchant, and Anna Grubb, from a large Quaker family in Clonmel. The Richardson family originally came to Ireland from England in 1622 and the Grubb family also came from England in 1656. John Richardson was raised at Glenmore House, outside Lisburn, County Antrim.  At the age of eleven, he boarded for three years at Ballitore, County Kildare (the same Quaker school attended by Edmund Burke) before attending another Quaker school at Frenchay, Gloucestershire.In 1844, Richardson married Helena Grubb (27 March 1819 \u2013 7 December 1849) of Cahir Abbey, Co. Tipperary, who was his second cousin, his mother, Anne Grubb, and her father, Richard Grubb, were first cousins.  John and Helena's shared second cousin once removed was Thomas Grubb, founder of the Grubb Telescope Company. John and Helena had a son, James Nicholson Richardson before she died giving birth to a daughter, named Helena.  In 1853, Richardson married Jane Marion Wakefield, of Moyallon House, Co. Down. A Quaker, John declined the offer of a baronetcy.  With Jane, he had one son, Thomas Wakefield Richardson and seven daughters. He died at Moyallon House, an estate inherited through his second wife's family, near Gilford, County Down. His estate surrounding his Bessbrook home at The Wood House and Derrymore House (now a National Trust property) is a designated historic park.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lisburn", "response": ["* John Grubb Richardson (1813\u20131891) \u2013 linen merchant, industrialist and philanthropist"]}, {"page": "John Richardson", "response": ["*John Grubb Richardson (1813\u20131891), major Irish industrialist who founded the model village of Bessbrook near Newry"]}, {"page": "Bessbrook", "response": ["Bessbrook was founded by John Grubb Richardson in 1845 as a 'model village', with spacious streets and squares surrounding a large linen mill owned by the Quaker Richardson family. As a social experiment it is similar to the model of the better-known Bournville company town founded by the Cadbury family near Birmingham, England, however it predates this development by more than 30 years. It is likely that the precedent on which it was based was the industrial village at Portlaw, County Waterford, Ireland, founded in 1825 by the Quaker Malcolmson family.", "Among the principles on which the village was based was a philosophy of \"Three P's\": there should be no public houses, no pawn shops, and consequently no need for police. It was John Grubb Richardson's belief that without a public house there would be no need for a pawn brokers or police station. To this day there are no public houses in the village. Nor are there any pawn shops, although nowadays there is a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) station. In 1885 the hydro-electrically powered Bessbrook and Newry Tramway opened."]}, {"page": "List of Quaker businesses, organizations and charities", "response": ["*The Inman Line, Victorian passenger shipping line on the North Atlantic, founded in 1850 by Irish Quaker industrialist John Grubb Richardson and Englishman William Inman"]}, {"page": "Joseph Barcroft", "response": ["Born in Newry, County Down into a Quaker family, he was the son of Henry Barcroft DL and Anna Richardson Malcomson of The Glen, Newry \u2013  a property purchased for his parents by his mother's uncle, John Grubb Richardson and adjoining his own estate in Bessbrook.
