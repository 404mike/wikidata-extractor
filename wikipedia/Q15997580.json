He bought the performing rights to the song \"I'm Selling up the 'Appy 'Ome\" which brought him newfound fame. The song is noted for being one of the first songs associated with his name. His popularity widened, and he made his West End theatre debut at the Tivoli in September 1890. Encores of his now famous song, \"I'm Selling up the 'Appy 'Ome\", were often accompanied with a hornpipe dance, which Champion performed. Champion followed this up with \"When the Old Dun Cow Caught Fire\" (written and composed by Harry Wincott), which he introduced into his act in 1893."]}, {"page": "Wincott", "response": ["* Harry Wincott (1867\u20131947), English songwriter"]}]}}
