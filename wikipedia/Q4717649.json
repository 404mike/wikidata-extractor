Another critic, author Alex Preston, writes that the novel describes \"a small life ... in a small, precise way: the dead hand of realism.\" In 2010, critic Mel Livatino noted that, in \"nearly fifty years of reading fiction, I have never encountered a more powerful novel\u2014and not a syllable of it sentimental.\"Mel Livatino, \"A Sadness Unto the Bone - John Williams's Stoner, The Sewanee Review, 118:3, p. 417.

Almond states, \"I devoured it in one sitting. I had never encountered a work so ruthless in its devotion to human truths and so tender in its execution.\" Sarah Hampson of The Globe and Mail sees Stoner as an \"antidote\" to a 21st-century culture of entitlement. She says that the novel came back to public attention at a time when people felt entitled to personal fulfillment, at the cost of their own morality, and Stoner shows that there can be value even in a life that seems failed.
