There were flourishing soul scenes in major cities like London and Manchester, often with many black artists, supported by local and pirate radio stations, but most acts were unable to break out into the national consciousness. Britain's post-disco sound contributed some new black artists to the emerging contemporary R&B sound (originating in the U.S.) by artists such as Imagination. Also of note were Junior, whose major hit \"Mama Used to Say\" made him the first black British act to appear on Soul Train, followed by Princess \"Say I'm your No.1\", Jaki Graham \"Could it be I'm Falling in Love\", Linx, Freeez and Central Line.  Increased interest in soul was reflected and fuelled by a series of covers and songs inspired by soul for a number of major acts, including Phil Collins's \"You Can't Hurry Love\" (1982), Culture Club's \"Church of the Poison Mind\", Paul Young's \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\" (1983), the Style Council's \"Shout to the Top\" (1984), Eurythmics' \"Here Comes the Rain Again\", \"Missionary Man\" (1986), ABC's \"When Smokey Sings\" (1987), and Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\", \"Roll with It\" (1988).
