The address was the home of a member, A. Jourjon, and became the club's address when it was registered as a new organisation at the pr\u00e9fecture on 11 March 1882. Evidence that de Vivie was a reasonably prosperous man is shown in a club rule that allowed membership only to amateurs, a definition which excluded ordinary working men.The argument, which nearly kept two English cyclists, Frederick Keeping and Edward Battell, out of the first of the modern Olympic Games was that only a gentleman had enough money not to need prizes. Therefore only a gentleman could be an amateur. Further evidence is the writer Jean-Pierre Baud's calculation that a bicycle cost 200 francs or 56 times the daily wage of an everyday worker."]}, {"page": "Frederick Keeping", "response": ["Keeping worked as a servant at the British Embassy in Greece. There were objections that he and another rider, Edward Battell, worked for a living. That made them \"not gentlemen so they could not possibly be amateurs.\" The historian Mike Price said: \"Gentlemen were not paid so were true amateurs. Servants had to be paid and so lost any claims to being amateur. Such was the attitude of the day\".
