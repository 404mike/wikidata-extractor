Goodrich became the first Dean of the Army School of Nursing.  Although the Adjutant General authorized a military uniform and an insignia consisting of a bronze lamp superimposed on the caduceus, the students in the Army School of Nursing retained civilian status.  In December 1918, there were 1,578 students in the program.  By 1923, the school had been consolidated at Walter Reed General Hospital.  It was discontinued by the Secretary of War on 12 August 1931 as an economy measure.  A total of 937 young women completed the course in nursing and received the diploma of the school.

In 1976, together with colleagues Nancy Roper, and Winifred W. Logan, and founded on the work of Virginia Henderson, she developed the 'activities of living'  nursing care model commonly referred to as the Roper\u2013Logan\u2013Tierney model of nursing. New editions were published in 1985, 1990 and 1996 and, with translation into many languages, it became well known around the world and of particular interest in some European centres, for example in the nursing school of the University of Heidelberg which had implemented nursing theories from the US as early as 1953.  Roper, Logan and Tierney\u2019s model has underpinned much nursing practice in the UK and beyond and  its use and evaluation was reviewed by the authors in a final monograph published in 2000. She worked in Edinburgh with Annie Altschul. In 1980, with Roper and Logan, she published The Elements of Nursing. This nursing model became the basis for the activities in daily life care model in European centres led by Juchli and  further developed by Monika Krohwinkel. Activities of Living care research was reviewed and updated by the authors through 2000 and, for example, the nursing school of the University of Heidelberg implementing nursing theories from the US and the UK as early as 1953, has included the theory of Roper, Logan and Tierney."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 1996", "response": ["*Virginia Henderson, 98, American nurse, researcher, and author."]}, {"page": "Nancy Roper", "response": ["\"The Roper-Logan-Tierney model is based upon activities of living, which evolved from the work of Virginia Henderson in 1966.
