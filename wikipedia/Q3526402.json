He was a specialist professional batsman, usually third in the batting order, who rarely bowled and generally fielded in outfield positions.\nBorn at Worsley, Lancashire, Tyldesley began his first-class career with Lancashire in 1895 and was a regular player until the First World War began in August 1914. He played Test cricket from 1899 to 1909. Tyldesley served in the British Army during the war, attaining the rank of corporal, and then recommenced his Lancashire career in 1919. He effectively retired from first-class cricket at the end of that season but did make one further appearance in 1923. Through the 1920s, Tyldesley ran a sports goods shop on Deansgate in Manchester. He played for Lancashire Second XI for some years until the end of the 1926 season when he concentrated on coaching, remaining with Lancashire and running his business until he died, aged 57, at his home in Monton, Eccles, Lancashire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
