He was a specialist professional batsman, usually third in the batting order, who rarely bowled and generally fielded in outfield positions.\nBorn at Worsley, Lancashire, Tyldesley began his first-class career with Lancashire in 1895 and was a regular player until the First World War began in August 1914. He played Test cricket from 1899 to 1909. Tyldesley served in the British Army during the war, attaining the rank of corporal, and then recommenced his Lancashire career in 1919. He effectively retired from first-class cricket at the end of that season but did make one further appearance in 1923. Through the 1920s, Tyldesley ran a sports goods shop on Deansgate in Manchester. He played for Lancashire Second XI for some years until the end of the 1926 season when he concentrated on coaching, remaining with Lancashire and running his business until he died, aged 57, at his home in Monton, Eccles, Lancashire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 22", "response": ["*  1873   \u2013 Johnny Tyldesley, English cricketer (d. 1930)"]}, {"page": "1900s (decade)", "response": ["*Johnny Tyldesley"]}, {"page": "1873", "response": ["* November 22 \u2013 Johnny Tyldesley, English cricketer (d. 1930)"]}, {"page": "1901 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Len Braund, Charlie McGahey, Frank Mitchell, Willie Quaife, Johnny Tyldesley"]}, {"page": "1910 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Johnny Tyldesley 2265 @ 46.22 (HS 158)"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Johnny Tyldesley"]}, {"page": "Michael Vaughan", "response": ["Michael Paul Vaughan was born in Eccles, Greater Manchester the younger son of Graham and Dee Vaughan, and a great-great-nephew of the early 20th century Lancashire and England cricketers Ernest and Johnny Tyldesley.Holburn, Graham (25 July 2001).

In 1920, Lancashire finished runner up and bowlers Harry Dean and Lawrence Cook took 274\u00a0wickets between them. During 1921, interest in cricket reached an all-time high, with over 250,000 people attending Old Trafford and over 4,500 members. 1922 was a year of contradictions, a strong team winning seven out of fifteen matches by an innings, but still managing to lose seven and finish 5th; that season Cec Parkin and Lawrence Cook mustered 308\u00a0wickets between them and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000\u00a0runs.

In the first Test at Trent Bridge, Australia's lack of effective bowling options had Armstrong forced to bowl wide outside the leg stump in an early form of leg theory bowling to prevent the England batsmen from scoring quickly.  Bumbling and taciturn, Armstrong maintained an accurate line and length, and put a strangle on both England's run-scoring and the crowd's entertainment.  It was a recurrent pattern for the rest of the series, and lead to what was seen by spectators and the press as dull cricket.  Batsmen like the imperial Archie MacLaren would kick the ball away contemptuously, but lissome Johnny Tyldesley proved that runs could still made if a batsman employed more enterprise.  Hopping away to leg to make room for himself, Tyldesley cut and drove the leg-spinner to great effect in a strategy later used by Don Bradman against the bodyline menace."]}, {"page": "List of International cricket families", "response": ["* Johnny Tyldesley"]}, {"page": "Clem Hill", "response": ["Hill was the victim of bad luck during this sequence of scores between 90 and 99. At Melbourne during the New Years Test he scored 99; the first time a batsman was dismissed one run short of a century in Test cricket.Meher-Homji, p. 27. In the first innings in the next Test in Adelaide, having scored 98, Hill was caught by Johnny Tyldesley who was standing on the bicycle track surrounding the oval. Tyldesley attempted to call Hill back but Hill declined, saying the captains had agreed that the fence was the boundary, not the track. Under modern laws, he would have been not\u00a0out and the shot would count as six runs, allowing him his century. In the second innings, Hill's poor luck continued. He chopped down on a ball when 97 and then, to his horror, saw the ball rolling back towards his stumps. He attempted to hit the ball away from the stumps but accidentally knocked the leg bail and was out, bowled.

Around the time of the first Test, the tourists endured a dispiriting spell of poor form and illness. In the first Test, England scored 376 for nine wickets. Hirst scored 48 and Wisden described his partnership with Johnny Tyldesley of 94 in 80 minutes as the turning point of the innings. In reply, Hirst and Rhodes bowled out Australia for 36 in conditions that the umpires considered reasonable to bat in. Wisden described the two Yorkshiremen as bowling very well. Hirst had figures of three for 15 and Rhodes returned seven for 17. However C. B. Fry, who played for England in the match, believed Hirst to be the more difficult to play and that while Rhodes bowled well, the Australian batsmen got themselves out as they \"hurried to the other end and tried to hit Rhodes, without success. Well as Rhodes bowled, it was Hirst who was responsible for the debacle. This is the best instance I know of the bowler at the other end getting wickets for his colleague.\" The England side for this match was later described by some critics as the greatest England team in history.Thomson, p. 40. Rain prevented the match from being completed and saved Australia from almost certain defeat. The Australian team's next game was against Yorkshire. Hirst took four for 35 in the tourist's first innings, but in a low-scoring game, Yorkshire were behind after the first innings. After Australia had reached 20 for three wickets in their second innings, Hirst bowled Victor Trumper with what Hirst believed was the best delivery of his life and the tourists last wickets fell quickly. The team were bowled out for 23, of which Hirst took five wickets for nine runs as he made the ball swing.
