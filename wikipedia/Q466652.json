Numerous musicians continued to follow more traditional styles including Alex Beaton.", "Bagpipe competitions are common in Scotland, for both solo pipers and pipe bands. Competitive solo piping is currently popular among many aspiring pipers, some of whom travel from as far as Australia to attend Scottish competitions. Other pipers have chosen to explore more creative usages of the instrument. Different types of bagpipes have also seen a resurgence since the 70s, as the historical border pipes and Scottish smallpipes have been resuscitated and now attract a thriving alternative piping community.Hamish Moore of Dunkeld \u2013 maker of Scottish smallpipes and Highland bagpipes  Two of Scotland's most highly regarded pipers are Gordon Duncan and Fred Morrison."]}, {"page": "2005 in music", "response": ["*December 14 \u2013 Gordon Duncan, bagpiper and composer, 41"]}, {"page": "2005 in British music", "response": ["*14 December \u2013 Gordon Duncan, bagpiper and composer, 41"]}, {"page": "Turriff", "response": ["*Gordon Duncan, composer and bagpiper"]}, {"page": "Wolfstone", "response": ["1992 saw Wolfstone enter the studio once again to record their follow-up album, The Chase. By this time, piper Allan Wilson had left the band, and his position was filled for several years by a string of different session musicians, including Roddy McCourt, Dougie Pincock, Gordon Duncan and Martyn Bennett. The Chase proved a success, achieving gold status. The band were once again made busy touring, with the addition of TV appearances, for example the 1993 edition of Children in Need. An EP entitled Burning Horizons was released in 1993, consolidating bassist Wayne Mackenzie and drummer Mop Youngson as full-time members. In 1994, Wolfstone signed to Green Linnet Records, which consequently saw the release of Year of the Dog. About this time, the Celtic Records label reissued the band's early albums, Wolfstone and Wolfstone II.  Duncan Chisholm says: \"We disown those two albums. The band we are in does not reflect what was going on then; a different line up with different ideas and objectives; anyone buying those two albums is not buying a Wolfstone recording. We would never promote them and we certainly wouldn't sell them to anyone.\" Despite this, the first of these albums received a positive reception from AllMusic. In late 1994, the position of piper was finally consolidated when Stevie Saint joined the band full-time. He has remained in the line-up ever since.
