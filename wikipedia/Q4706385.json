On the eve of the poll, Alan Cochrane of The Daily Telegraph described it as an election Labour could not afford to lose because, \"For [Lamont's] personal prestige, her candidate simply must win.\" Labour won the seat with a swing of 7 percent from the SNP and a majority of 2,873. Lamont said that the result reflected \"the progress we've made\", but Curtice said that if the results were repeated across Scotland, the SNP would still be the majority party at the next election.", "Scotland voted by a 10% margin against independence, but the referendum returned \"Yes\" votes in some traditional Labour strongholds, particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, prompting media speculation about Lamont's future as the party's leader. Shortly after the referendum, Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy was discussing taking over from her, while The Herald reported that party delegates concerned about the results had started to view Murphy as a possible successor. Lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at the 25 September 2014 session of First Minister's Questions, the first of the post-referendum era. \"When the First Minister is long gone I will still be doing my job on behalf of the people of Scotland.\" Her position remained uncertain. Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats at the 2015 general election without a change of leadership. In October, two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party. McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described the party as \"a political machine that is angry about what has happened in Scotland in the recent past\". Shortly afterwards, his predecessor, Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded \"enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily\" because its supporters no longer understood \"what the party stands for\". Margaret Curran, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, said that although the party was changing, it needed to reconnect with its \"socialist principles\"."]}, {"page": "The New Party (UK, 2003)", "response": ["The initial policy programme of the party had two main planks: direct democracy, with all legislation subject to popular referendum; and Universal Benefit, a direct payment from the state to every citizen as a replacement for the current benefits system. A reduction of the voting age to 16 was also proposed. Taxes would be cut by 3p. The pledge to scrap the Scottish parliament was dropped, but the party pledged to sell the Holyrood Scottish Parliament Building, and to reduce the number of parliamentarians, in Holyrood, Westminster and an all-elected Lords. Alan Cochrane in the Daily Telegraph commented that \"the Scottish People's Alliance appears to offer a mish-mash of policies, which are for the most part half-baked \u2013 but not all that more so than many of the offerings from parties of much longer standing. And if they get their act together in time they might well appeal. Their most immediate problem appears to be that they have not got their act together in anything like enough time.\""]}, {"page": "Grove Academy", "response": ["* Alan Cochrane, editor"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Nicola Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson, Margaret Curran, Alan Cochrane, Mark Serwotka"]}, {"page": "2014 Scottish independence referendum", "response": ["* Alan Cochrane and George Kerevan, (2014) Scottish Independence: Yes or No (The Great Debate), The History Press "]}, {"page": "George Kerevan", "response": ["He is the co-author, with Alan Cochrane, of Scottish Independence: Yes or No, published in April 2014."]}, {"page": "2014 Scottish Labour leadership election", "response": ["Although Scotland had voted to remain part of the UK, the independence referendum had returned \"Yes\" votes in some traditional Labour strongholds, particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, prompting media speculation about Lamont's future as the party's leader.

Paul Hutcheon noted in the 9 November edition of the Sunday Herald that Labour had \"consistently declined\" to confirm the number of its members in Scotland, but quoted an \"informed source\" suggesting the figure was slightly short of 13,500. However, Peter Jones of The Scotsman subsequently quoted a less favourable figure of fewer than 10,000, with \"most of the existing constituency membership [comprising] the relatives and friends of councillors/MSPs/MPs [who] would not welcome ... an influx of new members who might try to oust second-rate post-holders in favour of somebody new and better\"."]}, {"page": "List of people from Broughty Ferry", "response": ["*Alan Cochrane, journalist"]}]}}
