The Heseltine family were in the tea trade: Michael Heseltine's great-grandfather, William Heseltine, was a clerk who worked his way up to being manager of Tetley, later being involved in establishing a chain of grocers; he killed himself after suffering the loss of his fortune through debt and bad investments.Michael Heseltine: A Biography, Michael Crick, 1997, p. 80 Michael Heseltine's grandfather, William's son John Heseltine, became a tea salesman and relocated from Huntingdonshire to Swansea,Michael Heseltine: A Biography, Michael Crick, 1997, pp. 2, 8 the docks being a major arrival point for tea shipments. Earlier generations were farm labourers in Pembrey. His mother originated in West Wales, daughter of James Pridmore, a dock labourer who unloaded coal from ships, later hiring others to do so and founding West Glamorgan Collieries Ltd, a short-lived company that briefly worked two small mines on the outskirts of Swansea (1919\u20131921); his father, also James, worked at the Swansea docks. Due to this heritage Heseltine was later made an honorary member of the Swansea Dockers Club.

(In the 1970s and 1980s, Heseltine's conference speech was often the highlight of the Conservative Party Conference, despite his views being well to the left of the then leader Margaret Thatcher.) He was eventually elected to the Library Committee of the Oxford Union for Hilary (Spring) Term 1953.Michael Heseltine, Life in the Jungle, Hodder & Stoughton, 2000, , p. 32.

He and his father had taken the precaution of arranging interviews to increase his chances of attaining an officer's commission in case he had to serve. He had been lucky not to be called up for the Korean War in the early 1950s or the Suez Crisis in 1956; and in the final years of National Service, already due for abolition by 1960, an effort was made to call up men who had so far managed to postpone service. Despite having almost reached maximum call-up age, recently reduced from thirty to twenty-six, Heseltine was conscripted into the Welsh Guards in January 1959.Michael Crick, Michael Heseltine: A Biography, Hamish Hamilton, 1997, , p. 79.", "Heseltine was granted leave to contest the general election in October that year; according to Ian Josephs this had been his plan from the start. Afterward he applied on business grounds for exemption from return to the Army, in part because of difficulties caused by an employee's embezzlement, and partly including the need to sort out his father's affairs, and was exempted from his remaining sixteen months of service.Michael Crick, Michael Heseltine: A Biography, Hamish Hamilton, 1997, , pp. 79, 92\u20133. During the 1980s his habit of wearing a Guards regimental tie, sometimes incorrectly knotted with a red stripe on the neck, was the subject of much acerbic comment from military figures and from older MPs with distinguished war records. Crick estimated that he must have worn the tie on more days than he actually served in the Guards.Michael Crick, Michael Heseltine: A Biography, Hamish Hamilton, 1997, , pp. 92\u20133.", "By now the property boom was in full swing. Heseltine and Labovitch established first one, then a group of companies under the name \"Bastion Properties\".Michael Heseltine, Life in the Jungle, Hodder & Stoughton, 2000, , pp. 60\u20131. Heseltine later recorded that he and Labovitch bought at least three properties in W1 and W2 which they were able to sell at a profit before they had completed the original purchases. They also built eight small houses in Queensborough Mews, Bayswater. They bought a 58-year lease on a block of seven properties at Stafford Terrace, off Kensington High Street, which they converted into flatsMichael Heseltine, Life in the Jungle, Hodder & Stoughton, 2000, , pp. 61\u20132. and built houses for Stepney Borough Council.Michael Heseltine, Life in the Jungle, Hodder & Stoughton, 2000, , pp. 70\u20133. Bastion also planned to build an estate of up to 126 housesit is unclear whether they actually built as many as this. at Tenterden, Kent, which failed to sell. In order to attract other buyers to the empty estate Heseltine had to accept an offer of \u00a34,000 for the first house, which had been valued at \u00a37,250. The estate was beset with repair problems until after Heseltine's election to Parliament.Michael Crick, Michael Heseltine: A Biography, Hamish Hamilton, 1997, , pp. 105\u20137.", "Between 1960 and 1964, Heseltine also worked as a part-time interviewer for ITV, very likely, in Crick's view, to maintain his public profile as an aspiring politician.Michael Crick, Michael Heseltine: A Biography, Hamish Hamilton, 1997, , pp. 109\u201312.", "It is unclear how Heseltine voted in the first ballot of the 1975 Conservative leadership election, in which the challenger Margaret Thatcher defeated Heath. Norman Tebbit stated that he and John Nott persuaded him to vote for Thatcher so as to open up the way for his preferred candidate Willie Whitelaw to stand on the second ballot. Another (anonymous) close friend later told Michael Crick that Heseltine voted for Thatcher. The Thatcher team had him down as an abstainer, while he refused at the time to reveal how he voted. In his memoirs Heseltine wrote that he abstained in the first ballot, but that he would have voted for Whitelaw in the first ballot had he stood against Heath.Michael Heseltine, Life in the Jungle, Hodder & Stoughton, 2000, , p. 61. Whitelaw admired his drive and energy but looked down on him as \"new Money\" and is said to have commented that Heseltine was \"the sort of man who combs his hair in public\".Crick 1997, pp. 182\u20133.", "Bramall admired Heseltine's \"great drive\" and his \"style, energy and vision about Europe\", but was displeased at Heseltine's rudeness. It was not uncommon for Heseltine to summon him to a meeting early in the day, then keep Bramall \"on hold\" all day as he kept putting back the meeting, and eventually earning himself a rebuke for failing to display the respect with which every officer in the armed forces is trained to treat his subordinates. A number of senior officers spoke of Heseltine in scathing terms, for example for his self-centredness, to Michael Crick when he was researching his biography.Crick 1997, pp. 255\u20136. Crick observes that with the exception of some defence chiefs, many people who worked with Heseltine came to \"admire and respect him\", although those who see him from afar are more suspect.Crick 1997, p. 352.", "In mid-1995 Major challenged his critics to \"put up or shut up\" by resubmitting himself to a leadership election in which he was unsuccessfully opposed by John Redwood the Secretary of State for Wales. There was speculation that Heseltine's supporters would engineer Major's downfall in the hope that their man would take over, but they stayed loyal to Major. Heseltine had been listening to regular reports about his potential support from his lieutenants Keith Hampson, Richard Ottaway, Michael Mates and Peter Temple-Morris, and in the event of a second ballot hoped to receive Major's endorsement. Peter Tapsell refused to support him because of the European issue. Hampson believed that Heseltine might have won, as did Philip Stephens of the Financial Times. Michael Crick does not agree, pointing out that many of Heseltine's supporters from 1990 had retired from the Commons and the 1992 intake was more right-wing and eurosceptic.Crick 1997, pp. 414\u20137.", "* Michael Crick, Michael Heseltine: A Biography, Hamish Hamilton, 1997, ."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Clarke", "response": ["*Michael Crick, Michael Heseltine: A Biography, Hamish Hamilton, 1997, ."]}, {"page": "Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire", "response": ["At the time of her death, journalist Michael Crick speculated that she was the last living Briton who had met Hitler."]}, {"page": "Iain Duncan Smith", "response": ["In the 2003 local elections, the Conservatives gained 566 seats.
