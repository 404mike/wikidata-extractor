Bolton were awarded a free-kick, following a foul on Thompson, by Liverpool defender Rob Jones, who was shown a yellow card. From the subsequent free-kick, Bolton striker John McGinlay received the ball, keeping it from the onrushing James, his pass into the Liverpool penalty area found Mixu Paatelainen whose volleyed shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. Bolton had another attack almost immediately. A pass by McAteer found Thompson on the right side of the pitch, but his shot went across the face of the Liverpool goal. Liverpool began to assert more pressure following the attack. A pass by striker Ian Rush in the 52nd minute found Bj\u00f8rnebye, whose subsequent shot hit the post.

Shortly before half-time, Alan Stubbs fouled Bury's David Lee, conceding a penalty; taking it himself, Lee scored his 16th goal of the season.  In the 60th minute, Mark Kearney brought down Bolton's Steve Thompson and Tony Philliskirk scored the subsequent penalty, equalising the score with his 27th goal of the season.  The game ended 1\u20131; Derek Potter of The Guardian suggested that \"there could hardly have been a more evenly balanced match\".  The second leg was played three days later at Burnden Park in Bolton.  The match was even once again, but Bolton took the lead just before half-time: after Bury failed to clear a corner, Philliskirk struck the ball past Gary Kelly.  Both Mark Seagraves and Stuart Storer made goal-line clearances to preserve Bolton's clean sheet and 1\u20130 win; they progressed to the final with a 2\u20131 aggregate victory.", "|5 ||Mark Seagraves"]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.\u2013Manchester City F.C. rivalry", "response": ["!scope=\"row\" align=\"left\"| Mark Seagraves"]}]}}
