The communication was copied into the 'St. James's Chronicle' (London, 1803), and the idea was afterwards worked up with much ingenuity by Dr. Thomas Girdlestone [q.v.] in 'Facts tending to prove that General Lee was never absent from this country for any length of time during the years 1767\u201372, and that he was the author of \"Junius's Letters,\"' London, 1813.\" Henry Manners Chichester in the Dictionary of National Biography, article on Lee.
