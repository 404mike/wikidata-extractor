She won the British Open on ten consecutive occasions and was the sport's most famous player until the rise of Heather McKay.\nBorn in Wandsworth, London, Morgan was originally a tennis player who played for Britain in the Wightman Cup in 1946. She quickly turned to squash and in 1948 and 1949 was a losing finalist against Joan Curry. In 1950 she won her first British Open title, beating Curry in the final. She went on to win the trophy for the next ten successive years through to 1959. Before the 1959 British Open Morgan announced that she would retire after the competition due to medical advice because she had suffered from persistent back injuries.Following the tenth victory and retirement she married Roland Horcae \u201cJoe\u201d Bisley later that year in 1959 in London. She became the first chairwoman of the Women's Squash Association soon after and was appointed MBE in 1961. Following the death of her husband Joe she married for a second time in 1965 to Ambrose Shardlow.\nMorgan also competed as a tennis player in the Wimbledon Championships from 1946 until 1957. In the singles event her best result was reaching the third round on four occasions (1946, 1947, 1954 and 1955).In 1962 a young Australian called Heather Blundell flew to Britain for the first time and stayed with Janet and her husband Joe and became a close friend. Her relationship with Janet Morgan helped her achieve great success. Morgan wrote a book in 1953 entitled Squash rackets for women and has been inducted in the Squash Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Squash (sport)", "response": ["The women's championship started in 1921, and has been dominated by relatively few players: Joyce Cave, Nancy Cave, Cecily Fenwick (England) in the 1920s; Margot Lumb and Susan Noel (England) 1930s; Janet Morgan (England) 1950s; Heather McKay (Australia) 1960s and 1970s; Vicki Cardwell (Australia) and Susan Devoy (New Zealand) 1980s; Michelle Martin and Sarah Fitz-Gerald (Australia) 1990s and Nicol David (Malaysia) 2000s."]}, {"page": "Sarah Fitz-Gerald", "response": ["Sarah Elizabeth Fitz-Gerald AM (born 1 December 1968) is an Australian women's squash player who won five World Open titles \u2013 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2002.
