Actress Sophie Winkleman portrays an older Susan at the end of the first film. In the book Susan is described as having black hair: \"And Susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand in marriage. And she was called Susan the Gentle.\"Lewis, C.S. \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", p. 201", "*In the 2005 Disney film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Susan is portrayed by British actress Anna Popplewell as a child and Sophie Winkleman as an adult.  Popplewell reprised the role in the 2008 film The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.  Susan is portrayed as a warrior queen, whereas in the books it is stated that she did not care for battles. Susan is also attracted to Prince Caspian in the film, and gives him a kiss before she leaves Narnia; this had not been included in the book or the BBC adaptation. Popplewell again reprised the role in the 2010 film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader for two scenes: one, in which Susan is seen in America writing a letter to Edmund and Lucy, and another in which Lucy, by reciting a stolen spell, has literally become Susan."]}, {"page": "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", "response": ["The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a 2005 fantasy film co-written and directed by Andrew Adamson, based on the 1950 novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the first published and second chronological novel in C. S. Lewis's children's epic fantasy series, The Chronicles of Narnia. It was co-produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures. William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley play Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, four British children evacuated during the Blitz to the countryside, who find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There they ally with the lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) against the forces of Jadis, the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).", "* Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, the second-eldest child of the four Pevensie children.", "In the novel, the battle is not seen until Aslan, Susan, Lucy and their reinforcements arrive. This was changed in the movie because Adamson said he could vividly remember a huge battle, an example of how Lewis left a lot to the readers' imagination. Other small changes include the reason all four children come to Narnia, in that an accident breaks a window and forces them to hide. Tumnus also never meets Edmund until the end in the novel. Minor details were added to the Pevensies, such as their mother's name, Helen, being the actual first name of Georgie Henley's mother. Finchley as the home of the Pevensies was inspired by Anna Popplewell, who actually is from Finchley. Adamson also changed the circumstances in which Lucy first comes into Narnia. He felt it was more natural that she first see the wardrobe while looking for a hide-and-seek hiding place, rather than just chance upon it exploring the house. The film also hints at Professor Kirke's role in The Magician's Nephew, such as the engravings on the wardrobe, when it is a simple one in the novel, and the Professor's surprise and intrigue when Peter and Susan mention Lucy's discovery in the wardrobe. When Lewis wrote the novel, it was the first of the series and the back-story later outlined by the subsequent books in the series did not exist. Additionally in the novel, the father of the Pevensie children is in London with their mother, but in the film, their father is fighting in the war as Lucy states to Mr. Tumnus when they first meet in Narnia.", "|Charlie Nelson (Walt Disney Pictures) Brigham Taylor (Disney vice-president productions) Mark Johnson (producer) Philip Steuer (producer) Douglas Gresham (co-producer) Andrew Adamson (director) Ann Peacock (screenwriter) Christopher Markus (screenwriter) Stephen McFeely (screenwriter)  Georgie Henley (actor)  William Moseley (actor) Skandar Keynes (actor) Anna Popplewell (actor)  (Walden Media)"]}, {"page": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian", "response": ["William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley, Liam Neeson, and Tilda Swinton reprise their roles from the first film, while new cast includes Ben Barnes, Sergio Castellitto, Peter Dinklage, Eddie Izzard, Warwick Davis, Ken Stott, and Vincent Grass.

Popplewell had been disappointed she barely used her bow and arrows in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. \"I think [Lewis] cast women down in the earlier books, but when you look at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman.\" Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because \"The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other.\" He knew it had to be \"sensitively handled\" though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but \"[accepting] the fact that you can have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on\". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.", "On April 1, 2007, the crew began filming at Barrandov Studios in Prague. There, sets such as Miraz's castle, Aslan's How and the underground hiding places of the Narnians were created. The  castle was built to scale because Adamson felt he overused digital sets on the last film. The castle was built in the open air during winter, where the temperature would drop to . Miraz's courtyard is the largest set in production designer Roger Ford's career, including the previous Narnia film. Aslan's How was modified into the hideout after filming for those scenes was finished. To create Trufflehunter's den, Ford's crew put a camera inside a badger's den to study what it should look like. The den's roof had to be raised by three inches because Ben Barnes was too tall.Audio commentary with Andrew Adamson, Ben Barnes, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley, 2008 DVD by Walt Disney Home Entertainment", "|Best Performance in a Feature Film \u2013 Young Ensemble Cast (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell)"]}, {"page": "Me Without You (film)", "response": ["** Anna Popplewell as  Young Marina"]}, {"page": "Diastema", "response": ["* Actresses: Uzo Aduba, Anna Paquin, Vanessa Paradis, Brigitte Bardot, Jorja Fox, Eve Myles, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Amira Casar, C\u00e9cile de France, B\u00e9atrice Dalle, Anna Popplewell and Octavia Spencer."]}, {"page": "December 1988", "response": ["** Anna Popplewell, English actress; in London, England"]}, {"page": "Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade", "response": ["; 2005: Hosts Regis Philbin and Kelly Ripa at Walt Disney World; Ryan Seacrest at Disneyland.
