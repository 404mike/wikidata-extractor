His biographer William Fotheringham has described him as \"the last of the sport's patrons\". In this role, Hinault would use his influence with race organisers, control the pace of the peloton, and allow or refuse other riders the chance to attack. The riders' strike at Valence d'Agen in the 1978 Tour is cited as the first instance in which Hinault assumed this role. His fellow riders stated that he, even though he did not talk much, was able to exert a high amount of certainty and therefore strength, which brought him respect and sometimes fear from his competitors. To signal his authority, Hinault often symbolically rode at the front of the field, instead of in the slipstream of his teammates. His riding style has been described as \"fighting, full of aggression\", and he stated that when he did not feel good in a race, his reaction would be to attack. Hinault described his own role as follows:"]}, {"page": "Tom Simpson", "response": ["In his biography of Simpson, Put Me Back on My Bike, William Fotheringham quoted Alan Ramsbottom as saying, \"Tom went on the [1967] Tour de France with one suitcase for his kit and another with his stuff, drugs and recovery things\", which Fotheringham said was confirmed by Simpson's roommate Colin Lewis. Ramsbottom added, \"Tom took a lot of chances. He took a lot of it [drugs]. I remember him taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event. He showed me the box, and had to take one every few days.\" although he implied that other competitors were involved. Lewis recalled Simpson acquiring a small box at their hotel.

Late in the race, he was part of a six-man leading group, including reigning world champion Lance Armstrong and Rominger. He accelerated away from the group and won the race. Just three days later, at La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne, Berzin and his  teammates Argentin and Furlan broke away from the field at the first passage of the Mur de Huy,  from the finish. The rest of the field was unable to counter what cycling journalist William Fotheringham called \"the greatest show of strength in any Classic by any team\". Argentin was allowed to win, in what was his last season as a professional, and Berzin finished third behind Furlan. Comments by Ferrari to the press afterwards, saying that \"anything that doesn\u2019t result in a positive test isn\u2019t doping\" cast doubts over the performance."]}, {"page": "Charly Gaul", "response": ["The organisers of the Tour de France invited him in 1989 as their guest when the race started in Luxembourg.

He began following cycling again, particularly Marco Pantani, the leading climber of the time. He was a guest at many races, including stages of the Tour. There he sat beside the rostrum and answered questions put by the commentator, Daniel Mangeas.

Author William Fotheringham shared that sentiment, specifically stating that Torriani designed the route in order to give Jos\u00e9 Manuel Fuente several opportunities to attack Eddy Merckx.

Robinson rode above his level across the Massif Central and next day paid the price; he trailed far behind the field. William Fotheringham wrote:In hot weather, these are some of the toughest roads in France, constantly rising and falling. Elliott remained with Robinson, chivvying him, pacing him, pouring water on his head as the Tour's doctor, Pierre Dumas administered glucose tablets. It was the kind of heroic spectacle the Tour reporters loved.

However, the team's manager, Sauveur Ducazeaux, insisted the judges apply a rule that no rider in the first ten could be eliminated. Robinson had started the day ninth: it was Elliott who was sent home. \"The mother hen was cooked; the chick avoided the pot\", Fotheringham said.  Robinson always regretted the outcome, and when he won the next stage, told journalists that he did it for Elliott."]}]}}
