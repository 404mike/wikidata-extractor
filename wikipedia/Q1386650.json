He is best known for failing a drug test after finishing third in the men's slalom of the 2002 Winter Olympics, resulting in him being controversially stripped of the bronze medal; he would have become the first British person to win an Olympic medal in a skiing event. The use of a nasal inhaler purchased in the US had led to the presence of a banned substance in Baxter's urine. He was allowed to return to competition, although his appeal to have the medal reinstated failed. He competed in FIS events from 1991\u20132009 and became known as \"The Highlander\". In the World Cup events, he achieved eleven top-fifteen finishes and four top-ten results.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Alain Baxter (born 1973), alpine skier"]}, {"page": "Baxter (name)", "response": ["* Alain Baxter, Scottish skier"]}, {"page": "2002 Winter Olympics medal table", "response": ["|Alain Baxter"]}, {"page": "Superstars (British TV programme)", "response": ["|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Alain Baxter", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Alain Baxter"]}, {"page": "Adam Hollioake", "response": ["Hollioake made several appearances on the BBC programme A Question of Sport and Sky Sports Cricket AM, as well as appearing on programmes such as the 2004 Test the Nation quiz.Adam Hollioake, IMdB profile.
