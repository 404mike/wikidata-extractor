Ferneyhough has taught composition at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Freiburg and the University of California, San Diego; he teaches at Stanford University and is a regular lecturer in the summer courses at Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse.\nHe has resided in California since 1987.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Classical guitar", "response": ["Within the contemporary music scene itself, there are also works which are generally regarded as extreme.

Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the \"technical and speculative innovations\" of Klavierst\u00fccke I\u2013IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter, they nevertheless produced a \"sharp emotion, the result of a beneficial shock engendered by their boldness\" and provided \"an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations\". While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British premi\u00e8re of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets\u2014how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core\u2014but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. Although it eventually evolved in a direction of its own, Ferneyhough's 1967 wind sextet, Prometheus, began as a wind quintet with cor anglais, stemming directly from an encounter with Stockhausen's Zeitma\u00dfe. With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, it seems to me that the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time. ... I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that \"Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course\" and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carr\u00e9, Klavierst\u00fcck X, Inori, and Jubil\u00e4um."]}, {"page": "Saxophone", "response": ["* Prometheus for flute, oboe, cor anglais, clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon (1967) \u2013 Brian Ferneyhough"]}, {"page": "Time signature", "response": ["Irrational time signatures (rarely, \"non-dyadic time signatures\") are used for so-called irrational bar lengths,\"Brian Ferneyhough\", The Ensemble Sospeso that have a denominator that is not a power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.). These are based on beats expressed in terms of fractions of full beats in the prevailing tempo\u2014for example  or . For example, where  implies a bar construction of four quarter-parts of a whole note (i.e., four quarter notes),  implies a bar construction of four third-parts of it. These signatures are of utility only when juxtaposed with other signatures with varying denominators; a piece written entirely in , say, could be more legibly written out in .", "According to Brian Ferneyhough, metric modulation is \"a somewhat distant analogy\" to his own use of \"irrational time signatures\" as a sort of rhythmic dissonance. It is disputed whether the use of these signatures makes metric relationships clearer or more obscure to the musician; it is always possible to write a passage using non-irrational signatures by specifying a relationship between some note length in the previous bar and some other in the succeeding one. Sometimes, successive metric relationships between bars are so convoluted that the pure use of irrational signatures would quickly render the notation extremely hard to penetrate. Good examples, written entirely in conventional signatures with the aid of between-bar specified metric relationships, occur a number of times in John Adams' opera Nixon in China (1987), where the sole use of irrational signatures would quickly produce massive numerators and denominators.", "Historically, this device has been prefigured wherever composers wrote tuplets. For example, a  bar of 3 triplet quarter notes could be written as a bar of . Henry Cowell's piano piece Fabric (1920) employs separate divisions of the bar (1 to 9) for the three contrapuntal parts, using a scheme of shaped noteheads to visually clarify the differences, but the pioneering of these signatures is largely due to Brian Ferneyhough, who says that he finds that \"such 'irrational' measures serve as a useful buffer between local changes of event density and actual changes of base tempo\".
