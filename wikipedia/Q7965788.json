The Alpine Club, established in 1857, began using the Lake District fells for training during Winters when the conditions in the Alps were not suitable. However, the frequent lack of snow in the Lakes led to the birth of rock-scrambling, which then developed into rock climbing that could also take place in Summertime.Thompson (2010), p. 216. The rock-climbers were not particularly interested in the Wordsworthian aesthetics of nature : they were \"seeking to challenge nature rather than commune or become one with her.\"Thompson (2010), p. 222. Owen Glynne Jones (Rock climbing in the English Lake District, 1897) established many new routes (on Kern Knotts Crag, Pillar Rock, Dow Crag) and was a friend of the mountain photographers George and Ashley Abraham.

An early benchmark approaching modern levels of difficulty was the ascent, by O. G. Jones, of Kern Knotts Crack (grade VS) in 1897. Jones was attracted to the new sport by a photo of the Needle in a shop window in the early 1890s.

It was published in Manchester in 1913 by the Refuge Printing Department (then an insurance company). Although focusing on rock climbing in the Peak District, it covers several adjacent cliffs outside this region, and despite its title, referring to the Millstone Grit (or gritstone) geology of many of the cliffs, it includes several cliffs consisting of other rock types, including mountain limestone and red sandstone. It is regarded as the first ever published rock climbing guidebook for the Peak District National Park.  Some Gritstone Climbs is one of the earliest guidebooks to rock climbing in the United Kingdom: Climbing in the British Isles by Walter Parry Haskett Smith was published in 1894 and the climbing guide The Climbs on Lliwedd, by J.

Ridley's XI against Oxford University at Oxford in 1879. In the same season he also played three first-class matches for Oxford University, including in The University Match against Cambridge. His final first-class appearance came in August 1879, for the Gentlemen of Kent against the Gentlemen of England at Canterbury.
