In 624 senior games, Gallacher scored 463 goals, playing senior league football for Airdrieonians, Newcastle United, Chelsea, Derby County, Notts County, Grimsby Town and Gateshead. Prior to this he also played and scored for then non-league Queen of the South.He is one of the Scotland national football team's most prolific goalscorers with 24 goals from his 20 internationals, a strike rate of more than a goal a game.

They defeated Aston Villa, winning the club's second FA Cup. Three years later, they won the First Division championship a fourth time in 1926\u201327, with Hughie Gallacher, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the club's history, captaining the team. Other key players in this period were Neil Harris, Stan Seymour and Frank Hudspeth. In 1930, Newcastle United came close to relegation, and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for Chelsea, and at the same time Andy Cunningham became the club's first team manager. In 1931\u201332, the club won the FA Cup a third time. However, a couple of years later, at the end of the 1933\u201334 season, the team were relegated to the Second Division after 35 seasons in the top. Cunningham left as manager and Tom Mather took over."]}, {"page": "Northumberland", "response": ["There are many notable footballers from the county, pre Second World War and immediate post war greats were George Camsell and Hughie Gallacher, these were described in the \"Clown Prince of Football\" by Len Shackleton.

Shackleton\u2019s book was controversial when it was first published because chapter 9, named \"The Average Director's Knowledge of Football\", was produced as a blank page.

The best known footballers of their eras to come from Dumfries are probably Dave Halliday, Ian Dickson, Bobby Ancell, Billy Houliston, Jimmy McIntosh, Willie McNaught and Ted McMinn. Halliday, Dickson, Houliston and McMinn played for home town club, Queen of the South during their careers. Dominic Matteo was born in Dumfries but moved to England while still a young boy. Barry Nicholson lost 4\u20133 to Queens playing for Aberdeen in the 2008 Scottish Cup semi-finals despite scoring against the team he supported as a boy. Ancell, Houliston, McNaught and Nicholson have represented Scotland and were joined in having done so in season 2010/11 by Cammy Bell and Grant Hanley. Matteo gained 6 full caps for Scotland after having represented England at under-21 level. Halliday was overlooked by Scotland in favour of Hughie Gallacher. Gallacher played for The Queen's but was not from Dumfries. It was as a manager rather than a player that Thomas Mitchell made his name as a multiple FA Cup winner at Blackburn Rovers before joining Woolwich Arsenal as Arsenal F.C. were then named."]}, {"page": "Dundee F.C.", "response": ["Dave Halliday had played on the left wing for his previous clubs, his hometown side Queen of the South and St Mirren. Halliday went to Dundee in 1921 where Scotland internationalist Alec Troup played left wing. Dundee thus converted Halliday to centre forward with prolific results; he finished as Scottish top scorer in the 1923\u201324 season with 38 goals from his 36 top division appearances. This remains the club record all-time seasonal league goal scoring record. Halliday top scored in England's top division in 1928\u201329 to become the most recent of only 2 players to be outright top scorer in Scotland and England. With Halliday Dundee reached the 1924\u201325 Scottish Cup final eliminating the holders en route, the Airdrieonians side of Hughie Gallacher. Dundee led Celtic 1\u20130 at half time in the final before losing out to a last minute Jimmy McGrory winner. Halliday top scored for Dundee in that cup run. In end of season tours with Dundee, Halliday scored doubles against each of Athletic Bilbao, Real Madrid, Valencia CF and FC Barcelona. Halliday scored 103 goals in 147 league and cup appearances for the Dee. He then moved South to set scoring records in England where other teams profited from Dundee's decision to convert Halliday to centre-forward.Dave Halliday full career profile on www.qosfc.com"]}, {"page": "Kevin Keegan", "response": ["thumb|upright|right|Keegan's grandfather Frank KeeganKeegan's ancestors arrived in Newcastle from Ireland.
