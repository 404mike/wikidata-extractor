McCartney was highly impressed with the \"harmonic structures\" and choice of instruments used on Pet Sounds, and said that these elements encouraged him to think the Beatles could \"get further out\" than the Beach Boys had. He identified Pet Sounds as his main musical inspiration for Sgt. Pepper, adding that \"[we] nicked a few ideas\", although he felt it lacked the avant-garde quality he was seeking.

With the Beatles increasingly involved in the production of their music, Martin's role as producer had changed to one of a facilitator and collaborator, whereby the band now relied on him to make their ideas a reality. According to Rodriguez, Revolver marked the first time the Beatles integrated studio technology into the \"conception of the recordings they made\". He views this approach as reflective of the group's waning interest in live performance before crowds of screaming fans, \"in favor of creating soundscapes without limitation\" in a studio environment. For the first time at EMI Studios, the company's four-track tape machines were placed in the studio's control room, alongside the producer and balance engineer, rather than in a dedicated machine room. The Beatles' new recording engineer on the project was nineteen-year-old Geoff Emerick, whom author and critic Ian MacDonald describes as an \"English audio experimentalist\" in the tradition of Joe Meek. Emerick recalled that no preproduction or rehearsal process took place for Revolver; instead, the band used the studio to create each song from what was often just an outline of a composition. Speaking shortly before the start of the sessions, Lennon said that they had considered making the album a continuous flow of tracks, without gaps to differentiate between each song.", "Recalling Revolvers release in his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald says that the Beatles \"initiated a second pop revolution \u2013 one which while galvanising their existing rivals and inspiring many new ones, left all of them far behind\".

Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly re-engaged themselves in songwriting, often meeting \"clandestinely in the afternoons in each other's rooms\" to review their new work. \"Regardless of what I was supposed to be doing,\" Lennon later recalled, \"I did write some of my best songs there.\" Author Ian MacDonald said Sgt Pepper was \"shaped by LSD\", but the Beatles took no drugs with them to India aside from marijuana, and their clear minds helped the group with their songwriting. The stay in Rishikesh proved especially fruitful for George Harrison as a songwriter, coinciding with his re-engagement with the guitar after two years studying the sitar. The musicologist Walter Everett likens Harrison's development as a composer in 1968 to that of Lennon and McCartney five years before, although he notes that Harrison became \"privately prolific\", given his usual subordinate status within the group.", "In a 2003 appraisal of the album, for Mojo magazine, Ian MacDonald wrote that The Beatles regularly appears among the top 10 in critics' \"best albums of all time\" lists, yet it was a work that he deemed \"eccentric, highly diverse, and very variable [in] quality\".

He derided tracks including \"Revolution 9\" and \"Helter Skelter\", but said that picking personal highlights was \"part of the fun\" for listeners. Writing for MusicHound in 1999, Guitar World editor Christopher Scapelliti described the album as \"self-indulgent and at times unlistenable\" but identified \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" and \"Helter Skelter\" as \"fascinating standouts\" that made it a worthwhile purchase."]}, {"page": "The Byrds", "response": ["However, the tour did enable the band to meet and socialize with a number of top English groups, including the Rolling Stones and the Beatles.

During this period of fraternization, the Beatles were vocal in their support of the Byrds, publicly acknowledging them as creative competitors and naming them as their favorite American group.

He said that their connection with the times was such that the Beatles \"did far more mind-liberating\" than Bob Dylan, through their greater record sales and \"because they worked in simpler, less essentially sceptical ways\"."]}, {"page": "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)", "response": ["Between 5 and 6 April 1965, while filming the second Beatles film, Help!, at Twickenham Film Studios, George Harrison first encountered a sitar, the Indian string instrument that would be a prominent feature in \"Norwegian Wood\". It was one of several instruments being played by a group of Indian musicians in a scene set in an Indian restaurant. \"Norwegian Wood\" was not the first Western pop song in which an Indian influence was evident: the raga-like drone was found in the Beatles' \"Ticket to Ride\", as well as in the Kinks' song \"See My Friends\". The Yardbirds also created a similar sound with a distorted electric guitar on \"Heart Full of Soul\". Barry Fantoni, a friend of Ray Davies of the Kinks, said that the Beatles first got the idea to use Indian instrumentation when Fantoni played them \"See My Friends\". According to author Ian MacDonald, however, while the Kinks' single most likely influenced the Beatles, Davies could well have been influenced by \"Ticket to Ride\" when recording \"See My Friends\". Rather than the Kinks or the Yardbirds, Harrison attributed his growing interest in Indian sounds to people mentioning the name of Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar to him, culminating in a discussion he had with David Crosby of the Byrds. The discussion took place in Los Angeles on 25 August, during the Beatles' 1965 American tour. Once back in London, Harrison followed Crosby's suggestion by seeking out Shankar's recordings, and he also purchased a cheap sitar, from the Indiacraft store on Oxford Street. Ringo Starr later cited Harrison's use of sitar on \"Norwegian Wood\" as an example of the Beatles' eagerness to incorporate new sounds in 1965, saying: \"you could walk in with an elephant, as long as it was going to make a musical note.\""]}, {"page": "Krautrock", "response": ["Various sources claim that \"krautrock\" was originally a humorous term coined in the early 1970s, either by British disc jockey John Peel or by the UK music newspaper Melody Maker, in which experimental German bands found an early and enthusiastic following.'Krautrock - Cosmic Rock and its Legacy' by David Stubbs, Erik Davis, Michel Faber and various contributing authors. Published 2009 by Black Dog Publishing Limited, London  The first use of the term however, was found in a full page advertisement from Popo Music Management and Bacillus Records promoting German Rock in the UK, in April 1971. The music emerging in Germany was first covered extensively in three concurrent issues of the UK music paper New Musical Express in the month of December 1972, by journalist Ian MacDonald.Macdonald, I.

New Musical Express printed a more mixed review from Ian MacDonald on 2 September 1972. He thought the group were \"not just close to the edge, they've gone right over it\", though they \"played their God-damned guts out\" on the album which he called \"an attempt to overwhelm us which resulted in only unmemorable meaninglessness\". MacDonald concluded: \"On every level but the ordinary aesthetic one, it's one of the most remarkable records pop has yet produced\". American music magazine Cashbox hailed the album as \"a recording masterpiece\". In a positive review, Billboard selected the album in its weekly \"Billboard Pick\" feature, noting that Yes had \"progressed to the point where they are light years beyond their emulators, proving to be no mere flash in the pan. The sound tapestries they weave are dainty fragments, glimpses of destinies yet to be formed, times that fade like dew drops in the blurriness of desires half-remembered. All involved deserve praise and thanks, this being not a mere audio experience, transcending the medium it brings all senses into play.\""]}, {"page": "Here, There and Everywhere", "response": ["The recording is noted for its layered backing vocals, which McCartney, Lennon and George Harrison spent much of the three days attempting to perfect. McCartney mentioned in the 1989 radio series McCartney on McCartney that the vocals were meant to have a Beach Boys sound; he has also said that he was trying to sing it in the style of Marianne Faithfull. McCartney's lead vocal on the recording is multi-tracked. In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald also comments on Harrison's lead guitar part being given a mandolin-like tone via a Leslie speaker effect, before it adopts a \"horn-like timbre\" for the song's ending.", "Less impressed, Ian MacDonald admired the \"ingenuity of the music\", but concluded that \"for all its soft-focus charm, the song's overall effect is chintzy and rather cloying.\" In his chapter on Revolver in the book The Album, James Perone describes \"Here, There and Everywhere\" as a \"mid 1960s love ballad that could find its way into the set list for bands at a senior prom\" and a track that to some listeners appears \"syrupy and mushy\". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound pairs it with \"Got to Get You into My Life\" as songs that are \"seemingly out of place\" on Revolver amid the overtly psychedelic and experimental music that typifies the album.", "According to Ian MacDonald:"]}, {"page": "For No One", "response": ["According to Ian MacDonald:"]}, {"page": "The Long and Winding Road", "response": ["Speaking to music journalist Richard Williams soon after the overdubbing sessions, Spector said that he had asked whether any of the Beatles would like to help him produce the album, but none of them had wanted to.

He later said he was forced into orchestrating \"The Long and Winding Road\" to cover the poor quality of Lennon's bass playing; Spector also denied that McCartney was not consulted, saying that he had first contacted McCartney about the choice of musical arranger. In his book Revolution in the Head, Beatles scholar Ian MacDonald wrote: \"The song was designed as a standard to be taken up by mainstream balladeers \u2026 It features some atrocious bass-playing by Lennon, prodding clumsily around as if uncertain of the harmonies and making many comical mistakes. Lennon's crude bass playing on 'The Long and Winding Road', though largely accidental, amounts to sabotage when presented as finished work.\" In 2003, Spector called McCartney's criticism \"hypocritical\", alleging that \"Paul had no problem picking up the Academy Award  for the Let It Be movie soundtrack, nor did he have any problem in using my arrangement of the string and horn and choir parts when he performed it during 25 years of touring on his own. If Paul wants to get into a pissing contest about it, he's got me mixed up with someone who gives a shit.\""]}]}}
