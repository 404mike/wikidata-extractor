S. Naipaul's father, Seepersad Naipaul) is born in rural Trinidad and Tobago to Hindu Indian parents and his father is a Brahmin.

Possibly a liar as well\", and that he will \"eat up his mother and father\". The pundit advises that the boy be kept \"away from trees and water. Particularly water\". A few years later, Mohun leads a neighbour's calf, which he is tending, to a stream. The boy, who has never seen water \"in its natural form\", becomes distracted and allows the calf to wander off. Mohun then hides in fear of punishment. His father, believing his son to be in the water, drowns in an attempt to save him, thus in part fulfilling the pundit's prophecy. This leads to the dissolution of the family. Mohun's sister is sent to live with a wealthy aunt and uncle, Tara and Ajodha.

The first, Finding A Place: IndoTrinidadian Literature (Kingston, Jamaica: Ian Randle Publishers, 2002) explores the groundbreaking arena of society-formation and the socio-cultural, economic and political adaptations of early colonial migrants as well as the relationship between journalism and fiction in West Indian literature, tracing antecedents to the works of authors such as Seepersad Naipaul, V. S. Naipaul, Samuel Selvon, Ismith Khan and Dennis Mahabir,. The book is a ground-breaking study that gives context to much of V. S. Naipaul's perspectives on colonialism, the Caribbean and Trinidad and Tobago, placing his writings within the context of some 200 years' gestation in Trinidad and its peculiar social, economic, political and literary evolution. Rampersad argues that the society's complex oral and literary antecedents propelled his acclamation as a 20th-century Lord of the English language and that early experiences of journalism on the island experienced by him and his predecessors, including his father Seepersad Naipaul, legislator/authors as F. E. M. Hosein, Dennis Mahabir, and near contemporaries such as Samuel Selvon and Ismith Khan, influenced their leanings towards expanding the literary tradition in social realism tradition.Kris Rampersad: Naipaul was no fluke:"]}, {"page": "Nepal (surname)", "response": ["*Seepersad Naipaul, "]}, {"page": "List of Trinidad and Tobago writers", "response": ["* Seepersad Naipaul (1906\u20131953) "]}, {"page": "List of Indo-Trinidadians and Tobagonians", "response": ["*Seepersad Naipaul"]}]}}
