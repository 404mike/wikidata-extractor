He was born at Hardington Mandeville, Somerset and died at Oxford. \nVassall was the son of the rector of Hardington Mandeville. He was educated at Charterhouse School and at Oriel College, Oxford and he played cricket for his college but not for the university side. His fame at Oxford was as a long jumper, and he was the champion for three consecutive years from 1897 to 1899 in the Varsity athletic match against Cambridge University, his jump of 23 feet and three inches in 1899 being only two inches short of the then record, held by C. B. Fry.On leaving the university, Vassall became a schoolmaster at the Dragon School in Oxford, remaining there until his death, by which time he was joint headmaster. In the school holidays in 1902, 1903 and 1905, he played a few cricket matches for Somerset as a lower-order batsman and right-arm fast bowler. In his first game, against Surrey, he joined Peter Randall Johnson with Somerset needing 65 for victory with three wickets to fall and hit an unbeaten 27 to take his side to success. But in his five other matches for Somerset over the next three years he only made 19 other runs and his only wicket came in 1905 when, as the seventh bowler used, he finally broke a stand of 261 by the Kent second wicket pair Ted Dillon and James Seymour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Gilbert Vassall (1876\u20131941), English cricketer who played six first-class matches"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Gilbert Vassall (1902\u20131905) 6 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Fred Coyle", "response": ["He played his first match for Somerset in August 1903, when he, Sammy Woods and Frank Phillips came into the team replacing John Daniell, Oswald Samson and Gilbert Vassall. Facing Kent in Taunton, Coyle was not brought on to bowl until the visitors had already accrued 157 runs, and only bowled three overs in the innings. He opened the bowling in the second innings, but only bowled four overs before the game finished as a draw. He did not take a wicket in either innings, and did not appear for Somerset again that season."]}, {"page": "1906 Sheriff of London Charity Shield", "response": ["|FW || ||  Gilbert Vassall"]}, {"page": "List of British champions in long jump", "response": ["|Gilbert Vassall"]}]}}
