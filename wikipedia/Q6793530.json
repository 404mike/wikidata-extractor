From 1929 to 1935, he worked as the Labour Party's communications officer. He was also a broadcast commentator and a member of the executive of the National Union of Journalists.\nWebb was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bradford Central in the 1945 general election. He served as the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party from 1946 to 1950. In 1949, he intervened to delay Brian Close's National Service so the eighteen-year-old Close could complete the cricket season playing for Yorkshire County Cricket Club. In 1950, he was appointed as Minister of Food, a key role in a time of rationing, and was appointed as a Privy Counsellor. After his Bradford Central seat was abolished for the 1955 general election, he contested Bradford North but narrowly lost to the sitting Conservative MP.\nHe died in June 1956, aged 51.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Parliamentary Labour Party", "response": ["** Maurice Webb (1946\u201350) \u2013 Liaison Committee"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Maurice Webb"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Maurice Webb"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1936\u20131952)", "response": ["*Maurice Webb (1904\u20131956)"]}, {"page": "Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom", "response": ["After the war, attempts to relaunch the business in 1947 failed to catch on with journalists who condemned the gimmickry calling the show fake.
