He started a political blog, The Daily Dish, in 2000, and eventually moved his blog to platforms, including Time, The Atlantic, The Daily Beast, and finally an independent subscription-based format. He announced his retirement from blogging in 2015. From 2016 to 2020, Sullivan was a writer-at-large at New York. His newsletter The Weekly Dish was launched in July 2020.Sullivan has stated that his liberal conservatism is rooted in his Catholic background and in the ideas of the British political philosopher Michael Oakeshott. In 2003, he wrote he was no longer able to support the American conservative movement, as he was disaffected with the Republican Party's continued rightward shift towards social conservatism on social issues during the George W. Bush era.Born and raised in Britain, he has lived in the United States since 1984 and currently resides in Washington, D.C., and Provincetown, Massachusetts.

The queer movement rejected causes viewed as assimilationist, such as marriage, military inclusion and adoption. This radical stance and rejection of U.S. Imperialism continued the tradition of earlier Lesbian and Gay anti-war activism, and solidarity with a variety of leftist movements, such as seen in the positions taken at the first two National Marches on Washington in 1979 and 1987,  the radical direct action of groups like ACT UP, and the historical importance of events like the Stonewall riots. The radical Queer groups following in this tradition of LGBT activism contrasted firmly with, \"the holy trinity of marriage, military service and adoption [which had] become the central preoccupation of a gay movement centered more on obtaining straight privilege than challenging power.\" Commentators noted that it was exactly these \"revolting queers\" (who were now being pushed aside) who had made it safe for the assimilationists to now have the option of assimilation."]}, {"page": "Allan Bloom", "response": ["In an article on Bloom for The New Republic in 2000, conservative commentator Andrew Sullivan wrote that \"reading [Bloom] ... one feels he has not merely understood Nietzsche; he has imbibed him.
