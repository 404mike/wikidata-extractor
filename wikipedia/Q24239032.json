While he was a boy, his father changed his surname from Atkinson to his wife\u2019s, Savile. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 11 May 1802, aged 18, and at Lincolns Inn, which he joined in 1804. In 1807 he was elected as a member of Parliament for Okehampton, a pocket borough with two seats in parliament where his property gave him complete control, and was appointed as the borough\u2019s Recorder, but he was not called to the bar until 1817.Savile was an enthusiast for fox hunting, serving as a master of foxhounds and writing on the subject.Savile was independent-minded in his politics. In 1818, he and his father were both elected for Okehampton. In 1819, his father died, and Savile inherited the whole of his father\u2019s estate, valued at almost \u00a360,000, equivalent to \u00a34,585,527 in 2019. In 1820, he was commissioned as a Captain into the East Devon militia. At the general election of 1820 he had himself elected again for Okehampton, together with Lord Dunalley, a supporter of Lord Liverpool\u2019s ministry, but only seven weeks later by taking the Chiltern Hundreds he gave up his seat for Lord Glenorchy, a Whig and a fellow member of Brooks's. After that he sold the two seats in parliament provided by his borough and died in January 1831 from \u201can inflammatory affection\u201d.On 7 March 1815, Savile married Eleanora Elizabeth, a daughter of Sir Bourchier Wrey, of Tawstock Court, Barnstaple, Devon, and they had eight sons and five daughters. Most of his estate, valued at under \u00a325,000, including his property in the borough of Okehampton, went  to his eldest son, Albany Bourchier Savile, who was a minor.One of Savile\u2019s younger sons, Lieutenant-Colonel John Walter Savile, was the father of Leopold Halliday Savile (1870\u20131953), a civil engineer. Other sons were Bourchier Wrey Savile (1817\u20131888), a clergyman, and Brigadier-General Walter Clare Savile.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Okehampton (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Spencer and Bedford shortly afterwards sold their interest in the borough, and it was eventually bought by Albany Savile for \u00a360,000. A second disputed election in 1810 led to a judgment that reaffirmed and strengthened the patron's power: on this occasion, it was determined that the franchise belonged to the freeholders and freemen of the borough, and further that the patron had the right to create freemen at will. This, of course, gave him total control of elections since he could create new voters without limit to swamp any opposition. Nevertheless, the relationship was not one-sided, and Savile did much for the town, lending considerable sums to the Corporation which were never repaid.", "|rowspan=\"4\"| Albany Savile"]}, {"page": "Bourchier Wrey Savile", "response": ["He was born on 11 March 1817, the second son of Albany Savile (d. 1831), a Member of Parliament for Okehampton in Devon, by his wife Eleanora Elizabeth Wrey, a daughter of Sir Bourchier Wrey, 7th Baronet (1757\u20131826), of Tawstock Court in North Devon."]}, {"page": "Brooks's", "response": ["*Albany Savile (c. 1783\u20131831)"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1818\u20131832)", "response": ["|16 June 1820||Okehampton||u||Albany Savile||Lord Glenorchy||Resignation"]}, {"page": "Christopher Atkinson Saville", "response": ["He then bought extensive properties in Okehampton in Devon, which gave him control of both parliamentary seats of the pocket borough of Okehampton, and at the election of 1807 he returned his son Albany Savile (1783-1831).
