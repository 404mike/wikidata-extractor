Mordred is especially prominent in popular modern era Arthurian literature, as well as in film, television, and comics.Torregrossa, Michael A., \"Will the 'Reel' Mordred Please Stand Up? Strategies for Representing Mordred in American and British Arthurian Film\" in Cinema Arthuriana: Twenty Essays (Rev. edn.), ed. Kevin J. Harty.

He has been portrayed on screen by Leonard Penn (The Adventures of Sir Galahad 1949), Brian Worth (The Adventures of Sir Lancelot 1956\u20131957), David Hemmings (Camelot 1967), Robert Addie (Excalibur 1981), Nickolas Grace (Morte d'Arthur 1984), Simon Templeman (The Legend of Prince Valiant 1991\u20131994), Jason Done (Merlin 1998), Craig Sheffer\u00a0(Merlin: The Return 2000), Hans Matheson (The Mists of Avalon 2001), and Asa Butterfield and Alexander Vlahos (Merlin 2008\u20132012), among others. In such modern adaptations, Morgause is often conflated with (and into) the character of Morgan le Fay, who may be Mordred's mother or alternatively his lover or wife. A few works of the Middle Ages and today, however, portray Mordred as less a traitor and more a conflicted opportunist, or even a victim of fate.The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 394. Even Malory, who depicts Mordred as a villain, notes that the people rallied to him because, \"with Arthur was none other life but war and strife, and with Sir Mordred was great joy and bliss.\""]}, {"page": "2001 in film", "response": ["| The Mists of Avalon || TNT / Constantin Film / Stillking Films / Wolper Organization || Uli Edel (director); Gavin Scott (screenplay); Anjelica Huston, Julianna Margulies, Joan Allen, Samantha Mathis, Edward Atterton, Michael Vartan, Caroline Goodall, Michael Byrne, Hans Matheson, Mark Lewis Jones, Clive Russell, Biddy Hodson, Ian Duncan, Tamsin Egerton, Freddie Highmore, Christopher Fulford, David Calder, Hugh Ross, Edward Jewesbury, Noah Huntley, Karel Dobr\u00fd, Kl\u00e1ra Issov\u00e1, Tony Curran || Drama, Fantasy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1998 in film", "response": ["| Les Mis\u00e9rables || Columbia Pictures / Mandalay Entertainment || Bille August (director); Rafael Yglesias (screenplay); Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, Hans Matheson, Jon Kenny, John McGlynn, Kelly Hunter, Lennie James, Peter Vaughan, Julian Rhind-Tutt, David Birkin, Ben Crompton, Patsy Byrne, Frank O'Sullivan, Christopher Adamson, Tim Barlow, Shannon McCormick, Reine Brynolfsson, Kathleen Byron, Toby Jones, Edward Tudor-Pole, Gillian Hanna || Drama || Live action", "| Still Crazy || Columbia Pictures || Brian Gibson (director); Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais (screenplay); Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, Bill Nighy, Juliet Aubrey, Helena Bergstr\u00f6m, Bruce Robinson, Hans Matheson, Lee Williams, Rachael Stirling, Alphonsia Emmanuel, Phil Daniels, Zoe Ball, Frances Barber, Rupert Penry-Jones || Comedy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1999 in film", "response": ["| Still Crazy || Columbia Pictures || Brian Gibson (director); Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais (screenplay); Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Jimmy Nail, Timothy Spall, Bill Nighy, Juliet Aubrey, Helena Bergstrom, Bruce Robinson, Hans Matheson, Lee Williams, Rachael Stirling, Alphonsia Emmanuel, Phil Daniels, Zoe Ball, Frances Barber, Rupert Penry-Jones || Comedy || Live action"]}, {"page": "Stornoway", "response": ["*Hans Matheson - actor"]}, {"page": "Ken Narita", "response": ["* 300: Rise of an Empire (Aeschylus (Hans Matheson)"]}, {"page": "The Virgin Queen (TV serial)", "response": ["| Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex || Hans Matheson  || 3, 4"]}, {"page": "Deathwatch (2002 film)", "response": ["* Hans Matheson as Private Jack Hawkstone.
