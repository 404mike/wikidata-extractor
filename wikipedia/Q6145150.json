This bridge design is mainly constructed by equilateral triangles which can carry both tension and compression. The first suspension bridge to utilize a Warren truss in its design was the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.\n\nThe Warren Truss design was also used in early aviation when biplanes were dominant, the alternating diagonal truss being used for the interplane struts in aircraft such as the Handley Page H.P.42 airliner and the Fiat CR.42 fighter. The Warren truss is one of the most widely used and known bridge styles worldwide.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1848 in science", "response": ["* August 15 \u2013 James Warren submits a U.K. patent application for the Warren truss."]}, {"page": "Truss bridge", "response": ["The Warren truss was patented in 1848 by James Warren and Willoughby Theobald Monzani, and consists of longitudinal members joined only by angled cross-members, forming alternately inverted equilateral triangle-shaped spaces along its length, ensuring that no individual strut, beam, or tie is subject to bending or torsional straining forces, but only to tension or compression. Loads on the diagonals alternate between compression and tension (approaching the center), with no vertical elements, while elements near the center must support both tension and compression in response to live loads. This configuration combines strength with economy of materials and can therefore be relatively light. The girders being of equal length, it is ideal for use in prefabricated modular bridges. It is an improvement over the Neville truss which uses a spacing configuration of isosceles triangles."]}, {"page": "Girder", "response": ["The Warren type girder replaces the solid web with an open latticework truss between the flanges.

Warren's name became synonymous with this form. The first major spans using this configuration were built in England, and English construction firms built prefabricated versions for use in the British colonies, especially India. Thomas Kennard then applied a more detailed analysis of the stress distribution, allowing further economy in the use of iron by varying the cross-sectional area of the top and bottom chords without adversely affecting strength. Kennard patented his invention in 1853, and it was the Warren and Kennard patent that was used by Bennett in his design of the Prince Alfred Bridge.

The Warren Truss is one of several variants on the basic kingpost structural system. It was patented in England by James Warren and Willoughby Monzani in 1848 and by Squire Whipple (inventor of the Whipple Truss) in 1849. The Warren consists of a series of kingposts set within parallel upper and lower chords. Because of the high stress where panel met, pins joints received undue wear which could cause failure. Once bolted gusset plates and riveting technology replaced the pinning technique, Warren Trusses came into regular use.  By the early 1900s, the Warren was commonly used for highway and railroad bridges. By the 1920s, other metal truss types replace the Warren truss."]}]}}
