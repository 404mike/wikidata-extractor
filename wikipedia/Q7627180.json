By 1907 more space was needed so premises were rented at Market Place in the centre of Henley-On-Thames, where the company remained for many years.", "The 2-stroke engine with crankcase compression had been invented by Joseph Day in the mid-1890s. This made possible lightweight engines and new applications. Stuart Turner was exploring making small 2-strokes for motorcycles and generators. In 1911, Stuart Turner developed a complete motorcycle using a Chater-Lea frame and Druid forks. The key part manufactured by Stuart was the 2-port single cylinder 2-stroke engine rated at 2 1/2 HP (71 x 75.5mm bore and stroke giving 299cc).\"The 2 1/2HP Two-Stroke Stuart\", The Motor Cycle, 9th Nov 1911, p1173 They exhibited it at the 1911 Olympia show (on the stand of R.G.

The inlet non-return valve is the subject of another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.\"An Improved Valve for use on Internal Combustion Engines.\", Patent GB191102214", "During World War I (1914\u201318), the company produced nuts and bolts, gas valves and a klaxon horn for gas attack warnings. The workforce expanded to over 300 men and 100 women. In 1917, Stuart Turner acquired Broadgates Inn in Market Place, Henley-on-Thames, and has used this as a base ever since.", "Shortly after the war, Stuart Turner introduced the P3 single-cylinder 2-stroke engine, designed by Alec Plint to drive lighting and pumping plants. This engine was to form the basis of a range of engines used for small power applications, particularly as marine engines and to drive generators, though also to drive equipment and pumps. Castings were produced in Stuart Turner's own foundry. The P4 superseded the P3 in 1928, and in 1930 the marine variant was introduced, and was sold in considerable number for fitment in small yachts and other pleasure boats. In around 1935/1936 the P4 was joined by the larger-bore P5 (268\u00a0cc) and twin-cylinder P55 (535\u00a0cc). While the P4 was made until the war, the P5 and P55 continued in production for over 30 years. For the marine engines, Stuart Turner produced a reversing gearbox and optional final drive reduction gear;  everything else, up to and including the screw propeller, was also available. The many variations of the engines (marine and otherwise) were indicated by suffixes to the engine number; so, for example, a P55ME would be a marine P55 with electric start (Lucas Dynamotor, Siba Dynastart, or separate dynamo and starter).", "Between 1932 and 1935, Stuart Turner produced the small (1/2 HP) type N engine, which had an overhung crank. This model seems to have been superseded by the type R 2-stroke engine, which was introduced in 1934 with a full width crank. The R2 being 84\u00a0cc, and the R3 having a larger bore size and hence 123\u00a0cc. These small engines were used for general utility, but also the R3M for pleasure boats, hire boats. The R3 was to continue in production until 1977.", "The model engineering range was extensive throughout the inter-war years, with much production sold as kits of castings, though some complete engines were also sold. Most of the models were designed to be representative of a class of engine, mainly steam driven, rather than an accurate scale recreation of a specific engine. Internal combustion engines were also available as kits, including the 'lightweight' 2-stroke petrol engine. From 1935, Stuart Turner was also the United Kingdom agent for the American 'Brown Junior' 10\u00a0cc engineThe Model Engineer, Vol 72, No 1763, p181, 1935 for which they developed an aluminium (elektron) airscrew. Some of the engines were intended to do a job of work rather than for the entertainment of a model engineer, for example, the 1935 Sandhurst horizontal 2/3\u00a0bhp engine, which was described thus:Bond's Model and Experimental Engineers Handbook, 1935, Jubilee Edition 'This engine will run on gas or petrol and is designed for continuous work such as dynamo, workshop or pump driving. It is supplied only as castings for the amateur to machine up.'. The larger steam engines, for example, the model 6A, are capable of 4\u00a0bhp and powering steam launches, thereby blurring the distinction between whether they were model engines, or designed to do a job of work, or both.", "Stuart Turner also produced a wide range of boilers to power their steam engines, and sold matched boiler and steam engine as complete 'steam plants'. The most common boilers are the small 501 and 504 copper horizontal types used to drive the model steam engines, but they also produced a range of riveted steel vertical boilers up to 20 inches diameter, and 36 inches high, either with a central flue or with multiple tubes. They also offered brazing services for customers' boilers.", "They also produced two complete model steamboats. The 24-inch Henley was produced from 1925, and had a single-cylinder S.T. oscillating steam engine, and the 39-inch Isis was launched the next year with a model 495 boiler and the twin-cylinder Star steam engine.British Toy Boats, Author Roger Gillham, Veloce Publishing, 2011 These boats were produced until at least 1936, probably until the war disrupted matters. There was a version of the Henley steamboat powered by a Stuart Turner electric motor; this boat was sold as the 'Magician'. The 4-volt electric motor was also sold separately.", "In 1923 the War Office invited Stuart Turner (and other firms) to design a very light air-cooled engine and generator for wireless. It was to be carried on a pack mule. The whole plant must not weigh more than 84\u00a0lb, it had to run in any temperature from freezing to 60\u00a0\u00b0C; it must not be affected by being carried upside down or in any position; it must govern within 5% and there were various other conditions. The result was that five firms produced engines but the Stuart Turner engine was the only one which fulfilled the requirements and passed the tests. This was the W.D. engine, which was a 4-stroke side-valve flat twin, and continued in production for 20 years. Two of these engines were taken on the 1933 Everest expedition to power the wireless sets.", "From 1928 until the war, the company issued nine patents (again naming Alec Plint) for milking machines and developed a diaphragm pulsatory milking machine which was marketed by Gascoine of Reading, who later took over the rights. They also developed pumps, and in the 1933 Bond's catalogueBond's Model and Experimental Engineers Handbook, 1933\u20131934, 2nd Edition a complete Stuart Turner electric motor and centrifugal pump on a baseplate with 180, 800, or 1120 gallons per hour was advertised. This evolved into the current product line of centrifugal pumps.", "In 1932, Stuart Turner produced the model K 4-stroke engine, which was a single-cylinder overhead-valve engine designed to power refrigeration units. Only 64 were made, the last in 1938.", "In 1934, Stuart Turner introduced the S type steam engine. This was not a model but a fully enclosed single-cylinder commercial power unit of 1 to 1.5\u00a0HP designed to drive generators or fans or pumps. It stood 22 inches tall with a 10-inch flywheel and weighed about 120\u00a0lb. Preston Services have stated that there were both slide valve and piston valve versions, only 247 were made between 1934 and 1962.", "In 1938, Stuart Turner developed a single-cylinder 2-stroke diesel with crankcase compression, the model H. At the time this was the smallest commercial diesel engine in the world. Archived from Stuart Marine Engines website. These engines were sold mainly to the RNLI for charging batteries.", "Stuart Turner also produced many internal combustion generators with uses such as charging aircraft batteries and providing dummy runway lights on fake airfields. Stuart Turner engines were built into the back of AEC fuel bowser trucks to drive a Zwicky Ltd pump to transfer fuel to aircraft. These P5XC engines were referred to in-house as the Zwicky engines.", "Stuart Turner continued to make engines (especially marine engines), pumps, generators, and model kits throughout the post-war years, though several of the pre-war model internal combustion engines did not reappear.", "thumb|Stuart Turner P5-powered 1.5KVA mains generator, c1960", "Stuart Turner marketed some small marine diesels from the Spanish marine engine company Sol\u00e9 as the Stuart Sol\u00e9.

From a 1977 Stuart Sol\u00e9 operators manual, it is known that Stuart Sol\u00e9 engines were available in 6\u00a0hp and 9\u00a0hp variants, which seem identical in appearance to the Sol\u00e9 Mini-1 and Mini-2 engines, based on Lombardini engines and made by Sol\u00e9 between 1974 and 1986. These were a common fitment in vessels made by the Cornish Crabbers boat-building company in the late 1970s and probably into the early 1980s, one 1981 example being listed for sale with an 11\u00a0hp Stuart Sol\u00e9 engine.", "Stuart Turner ceased their marine engine production in 1978, and the spares and support were transferred to another company. In 1987, Stuart Turner Ltd acquired Morewood Model Engineers and the Stuart Model range moved to Cheddar in Somerset. Still branded as Stuart Models, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Stuart Turner Ltd. Cheddar Models Ltd was formed as an offshoot from Stuart Models in the late 1980s. In 1991, the brand and range were sold to David Jones of Jones and Bradburn and it moved to Guernsey. When Cheddar Models went bankrupt in 2005 models and plans were absorbed back into the Stuart Model range. At some point, possibly as part of this reorganisation, Stuart Models had acquired the rights to the Plastow Traction Engine model range, which they sold in October 2006 to Bridport foundry of Dorset, who had been responsible for the castings. In July 2012 Stuart Models was bought by Bridport Foundry.", "Stuart Turner Ltd continued making domestic water pumps staying at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England.", "thumb|Stuart Turner No.10 V, built from castings.

Like the Star, the bevel drive was moved inside the crankcase, and banjo drive was used with a choice of either piston valve or slide valve. Bore and stroke were 0.75 inches. While the slide valve variant was only available as a kit, the piston valve version was available as a complete engine or kit. The Sun continued after the war as a piston valve kit only and last appeared in the Stuart Turner catalogue in 1989/1990.", ";H.U.

The 'new' version was introduced in c. 1930 and produced until the war. It had both crankshaft and camshaft running in ball bearings, duralumin connecting rods, aluminium piston, and valves all mechanically operated. There was also a single-cylinder version. The twin produced 3/4\u00a0bhp at 3000\u00a0rpm, and 1.3\u00a0bhp at 4200\u00a0rpm, weight 7.5\u00a0lb including the flywheel. The single weighed 4.25\u00a0lb and produced 0.6\u00a0bhp at 4500\u00a0rpm. In the 1938/1939 Stuart Turner catalogue the air-cooled version of the twin-cylinder engine was also available with 1.5-inch bore and 1.75-inch stroke, giving 74\u00a0cc. The advertising suggests the main market for these engines was 'record breaking model boats and hydroplanes', and the single's 30\u00a0cc capacity was stated in 1931 to 'conform(s) to the rules of International Power Boat racing'.", ";Lightweight :With the same bore and stroke as the AE, the lightweight single-cylinder 2-stroke is 29\u00a0cc, 1/8\u00a0bhp, revs to 3500\u00a0rpm, and weighs 3\u00a0lb 12\u00a0oz, 5\u00a0lb 12\u00a0oz with flywheel. Like many Stuart Turner engines the Lightweight had iron pistons. It was water-cooled, and was available either as a finished engine or as a set of castings.
