He also played for Plymouth Argyle, Newport County, Bristol City and Hereford United. In the summer, he worked as a member of the groundstaff at Gloucestershire County Cricket Club. A good wicket-keeper, he played for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 406 first-class cricket matches from 1957 to 1971. He took 707 catches and 119 stumpings, but was a relatively poor batsman  - his career first-class batting average is only 14.19, with a highest score of 63.\nMeyer was born in Bournemouth. When he retired, he became a cricket umpire. He umpired 26 Tests in England from 1978 to 1993, including the 1981 Ashes Test at Headingley. He also umpired 23 One Day Internationals from 1977 to 1993, including the Cricket World Cup finals at Lord's in 1979 and 1983.Meyer holds the accolade of being the only footballer in history to score a goal against Manchester United in the FA Cup and go on to become a Test match umpire. He scored in Bristol Rovers' 4\u20130 win over Manchester United in the third round of the cup at Eastville on 7 January 1956, which was United's 9th biggest defeat in FA Cup history.\nIn 2006, he published an autobiography, Getting It Right, co-authored with Andrew Hignell.\nMeyer's son Adrian was also a footballer, making 144 appearances and scoring 12 goals, for Scarborough, many in the Football League, before injury curtailed his career.\nHe died at the age of 83 in 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Atyeo", "response": ["Heavy snow fell on Boxing Day 1962 and stayed on the ground until a major thaw at the beginning of March 1963. During January Bristol City played only a single FA Cup 3rd round tie with the replay taking place on 7 March 1963 when City lost 2\u20133 at Aston Villa. Bristol City played only home games between the away defeats in league matches at Millwall on 15 December and at Swindon Town on 2 March. The backlog in fixtures led to Bristol City playing 8 matches in April and 4 in May a total of 12 games in 43 days at the end of the season. Atyeo only played in three of these backlog fixtures with Tait switching from right wing to centre forward. Bristol City scored 100 league goals but conceded 92 during the season. The \"Robins\" kept only three clean sheets, all in September, and failed to score in only four matches. Atyeo moved to centre forward for most of his 30 appearances scoring 16 goals and finishing behind both \"Shadow\" Williams and top scorer Brian Clark in the goal scoring charts. In a season of goals all five of the regular forward line reached double figures for goals. Both wingers Alex Tait and Jantzen Derrick scored ten goals, while inside forwards Clark netted 23 times and Williams scored 19 goals. Even Barrie Meyer the Gloucestershire cricketer scored seven goals in 6 games when deputising for Atyeo. Bristol City spent the whole season in mid table finishing in 14th position but second top scorers in the Third Division."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Barrie Meyer||||26||1978||1993"]}, {"page": "Harold Jarman", "response": ["Jarman made his debut for the Gloucestershire first eleven on 8 July 1961 in a County Championship match against Middlesex at the Wagon Works Ground in Gloucester. Batting at number 7 in the first innings he ended on 22 not out as Gloucestershire were dismissed for 144. Coincidentally, batting at number 8 in that lineup was wicket-keeper Barrie Meyer, another dual-sport professional who like Jarman also played football for Bristol Rovers. Jarman didn't bat in the second innings as Gloucestershire declared at 432\u20136 before going on to lose the match by one wicket."]}, {"page": "Roy Palmer (cricketer)", "response": ["Palmer's second Test as an umpire was only a little less controversial. Appointed to stand in the third match of the 1993 series against Australia, he and fellow umpire Barrie Meyer both complained to the match referee, Clive Lloyd, at the end of the third day about the ferocity of the appeals. The Australians were severely censured by Lloyd and the match ended in a draw, ending a long sequence of defeats for England."]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| Barrie Meyer"]}]}}
