He also wrote many Christian deist articles under the pen names \"Socrates\" and \"Publicola.\" These articles were lead articles and often the only original articles in one of England's most popular newspapers, the London Journal. Pitt's paper sold 5,000 copies a week, and because of the way newspapers were consumed in that time, it has been estimated he may have been read or heard by as many as a hundred-thousand people each week. Furthermore, many of his Christian deist writings were republished in Benjamin Franklin's American newspaper.Pitt was a Christian deist, and in many of his articles for the London Journal, he expressed the most important points of Christian deism.\nPitt was buried 23 January 1763 at Hampstead. \"Mr. Pitt, who died at his house in Essex-street at the age of 84, had formerly been editor of one of the periodical papers in favor of Sir Robert Walpole, and is supposed to be the person alluded to in the Dunciad under the name of Mother Osborne.\" Some letters of Mr. Pitt's are printed in Dr. Howard's Collection.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Dunciad", "response": ["These \"sons of a day\" are the daily newspapers that only had lifespans of a single issue.  They were frequently printed with two different papers on the same sheet of paper (front and back), and Pope quotes the investigation into Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford (conducted by Walpole's administration) as showing that the Tory ministry of Pope's friends had spent over fifty thousand pounds to support political papers.  The dead gazettes are mourned only by \"Mother Osborne\" (James Pitt, who had run the London Journal under the name of \"Father Osborne\"; he had been called \"Mother Osborne\" for his dull, pedantic style).  The champion of splattering in Dunciad B is William Arnal, a party author of the British Journal who had gotten ten thousand pounds as a political hack. In keeping with the insertion of Webster and Whitfield, earlier, Pope takes a new turn and has the winner of the depth dive be the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Potter (1674\u20131747), and he is surrounded by an army of minor authors, \"Prompt or to guard or stab, to saint or damn,/ Heav'n's Swiss, who fight for any God, or Man\" (B II 357\u2013358). These trimming religious authors are people like Benjamin Hoadley (who had been an aid to Smedley) and John \"Orator\" Henley. Potter describes the vision of Hades and the Styx pouring into the Thames, but it is not merely Lethe that pours in. Lethe and the effluvia of dreams go into the Thames, so the effect is that it \"Intoxicates the pert, and lulls the grave\" (B II 344). The Archbishop of Canterbury becomes the Archbishop of Dulness."]}, {"page": "James Pitt (journalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Pitt"]}, {"page": "Pitt, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Pitt"]}]}}
