It originally aired on CBBC in the United Kingdom from 16 December 2002 to March 2010, over the course of ten series, with three spin-offs. In the original release, the show was hosted by James Mackenzie who played the title role, and conducted a group of six children, known as warriors, over five days through a series of tasks and feats. At various stages in the adventure, the group loses the least successful warrior, until two go through to the final week to compete for the title of Ultimate Warrior.", "Raven (James Mackenzie): Originally from the Island of Alaunus, Raven is an ancient, immortal Scottish warlord and the warriors' guide throughout the quest; his name refers to his ability to shape-shift. He can read the warriors' thoughts, usually from the Raven's Eye in his staff of power, and he recaps what has happened previously on the quest, and both gives and takes away the warriors' lives from their standards. He has an elaborate style of speech, which has generated some catchphrases, including, \"Are you ready? Then let the challenge... begin\", and, \"May the luck of the Raven's Eye be with you\". Since the eleventh tournament began, the character's name was altered to 'Raven of Old', with his staff of power having been passed on to the new Raven. He also provides commentary on the challenges in all series except Series 11, and during series 12 is shown watching the warriors using a talisman."]}, {"page": "Castle Toward", "response": ["The castle, and  of woodland, were purchased by the Corporation of Glasgow in 1948. The building was used initially as a residential school for children recovering from illness or living in deprived home conditions. It then became available for residential education for children from all Glasgow Primary Schools and operated for 50 years as an outdoor education centre for children from Glasgow, Renfrewshire and further afield. With the reorganisation of local government in Scotland in 1996, ownership passed to Argyll and Bute Council and such centres were threatened with closure. Peter Wilson, at the time the principal of the centre, formed a company called Actual Reality to operate the centre, as well as a second council-owned centre at Ardentinny. Activities operated by Actual Reality included high ropes, kayaking, and orienteering, as well as gorge walks and hill walks. The grounds of the centre were used as a filming location for the children's BBC Television series Raven, featuring the actor James Mackenzie, up to and including the seventh series at the start of 2008. The house was also used for residential courses for young people in music and art. The Glasgow Schools' Symphony Orchestra and West of Scotland Schools' Concert Band visited regularly. The house has been a category B listed building since 1971, and the grounds were added to the national Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland in 2007."]}, {"page": "Raven: The Island", "response": ["Raven (James Mackenzie): Raven makes appearances in this series, but does not guide the warriors as frequently as in Raven, or The Secret Temple.

A single blob was now used: it featured a larger and plainer 'C' letter and was turned into a three-dimensional object, which would zoom around a screen often accompanied by a ball from which many arrows could point and some crystal lines were flying about. The idents had also the CBBC stars in the purple background with various floating objects (such as the cash registers for Kerching!, the heart balloons for Tracy Beaker or the flying birds for Raven) inside the CBBC logo, including Dani Harmer, James Mackenzie, Nev the Bear, Basil Brush, Devon Anderson, Tendayi Jembere, Jamie Sweeney, Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood. This style was changed so that the end screen changed to a single shot of the bug with the programme name below, and the DOG was also updated. In-vision for the channel continued to be used, however, it was used less and less: CBBC moved out of TC9 in December 2006 to TC12, where the presenter would just stand in front of a bluescreen while only a fixed camera is used.", "CBBC relaunched again on Monday 3 September 2007, with a new logo revolving around the letters of CBBC, each in a different style. A new set of idents followed these up, revolving around scenes including each of the 4 stylised letters before coming together at the end. These scenes could involve cartoon figures (including the animated CBBC shows like Shaun the Sheep and the animated segments from Tracy Beaker), or stars of current CBBC programmes (such as Barney Harwood, Basil Brush, James Mackenzie, Daniel Anthony, Dani Harmer, Ed Petrie, Oucho T. Cactus, Mark Speight, Kirsten O'Brien, Richard Hammond, Sam Nixon, Mark Rhodes, Caroline Flack, Gethin Jones, Andy Akinwolere, Z\u00f6e Salmon and the cast of M.I. High). Numerous different styles were made involving the different scenes, and were added regularly to reflect programmes. Children could also make their own versions, the so-called Mash Up, on the CBBC website, and indeed some of these were added to the main set. At the end of this sequence, a two-dimensional cartoon style endboard was added that contained the CBBC logo animating into place, against a white background with the green zig-zag lines of the look animating around the edge of the screen. This was altered on 10 September 2010, when the CBBC logo was given a 3D glossy look, and as a result the end boards were changed to a fully formed CBBC logo moving around on the green bars on the screen. In 2013, they added new variations of the idents which mixed up a few idents, or at least changed one thing about it."]}, {"page": "Gaynor Macfarlane", "response": ["| Alexandra Mathie, Jonathan Battersby, James Mackenzie, Molly Innes, Joanna Tope, Natalie Bennet, Chris Young and Jessica Richards"]}, {"page": "Jules Horne", "response": ["| Clare Waugh, Molly Innes, Isla Cowan and James Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "1979 in Scotland", "response": ["* 15 May \u2013 James Mackenzie, actor and TV presenter"]}, {"page": "Swashbuckle (TV series)", "response": ["*Al-hoy - James Mackenzie (series 6)"]}]}}
