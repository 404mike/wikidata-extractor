In 2004, he starred in a self-penned one man show called Jackson's Way at the Edinburgh Fringe. The intended run for the production was ten days, before the intervention of comedian Stewart Lee. Lee was so impressed by Adamsdale's work that he reportedly threw his full support behind Jackson's Way, lobbying for an extension of the run and using his clout within the industry to garner notice from critics and award committees. Adamsdale secured the Perrier Comedy Award for comedy.\nAdamsdale has since created several new shows: The Receipt, The Human Computer, and The Summer House. The Receipt, a collaboration with sonic artist Chris Branch, used innovative sound effects to punctuate a story about the little man in the big city. It ran at the Edinburgh Fringe 2006, winning a Fringe First and a Total Theatre Award. It subsequently toured nationally, and internationally to the Melbourne Comedy Festival and 59E59 Theatres in New York.\nIn The Human Computer, Adamsdale, a self-confessed technophobe, explored the world of computers. The show premiered in the new Traverse 3 venue at the Edinburgh Fringe 2007.\nHe made his film acting debut in The Boat That Rocked as Newsreader John, in 2009.\nHe was a regular cast member of the Channel 4 2011 series Campus, playing Jason the University accountant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 20th century", "response": ["*Will Adamsdale (born 1974), actor"]}, {"page": "List of Edinburgh Comedy Award winners", "response": ["|Will Adamsdale \u2013 Jackson's Way "]}, {"page": "Stoned (film)", "response": ["* Will Adamsdale as Andrew Loog Oldham"]}, {"page": "Underbelly (venue)", "response": ["*Will Adamsdale aka Chris John Jackson in Jackson's Way"]}, {"page": "Underbelly (events promoter)", "response": ["*Will Adamsdale aka Chris John Jackson in Jackson's Way"]}, {"page": "List of Total Theatre Award winners", "response": ["*Will Adamsdale/ Chris Branch - The Receipt"]}, {"page": "Adamsdale", "response": ["* Will Adamsdale"]}, {"page": "Stuart: A Life Backwards", "response": ["A stage production premiered in 2013 adapted by double BAFTA-winning writer Jack Thorne produced by HighTide Festival Theatre and the Crucible Theatre Sheffield.
