She is the author of several books on measuring biological diversity, and the importance for quantifying biodiversity for conservation. She has won numerous awards and honors, is regularly consulted for global assessments and analyses of biodiversity and conservation and her research is often highlighted by journalists.Magurran has worked with Robert May and other leading biologists, including Helder Queiroz, whom she advised. Her research projects often focus are on tropical freshwater fish communities - specifically the Trinidadian guppy- in the Neotropics and India.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Naturalist on the River Amazons", "response": ["Bates's book is cited in papers for its accurate early observations, such as of the urticating hairs of tarantulas, the puddle drinking habits of butterflies, or of the rich insect fauna in the tropics. The book and Bates' Amazon trip are covered in lecture courses on evolution by professors such as Anne E. Magurran and Maria Dornelas. The warm reception of Bates's Naturalist was not confined to scientists. The novelists D.H. Lawrence and George Orwell both wrote admiringly of the book. Lawrence wrote to his friend S. S. Koteliansky \"I should like, from the Everyman Library Bates' \u2013 Naturalist on the Amazon... because I intend some day to go to South America \u2013 to Peru or Ecuador, not the Amazon. But I know Bates is good.\"Lawrence, D.H. (2006). The Letters of D.H. Lawrence. Cambridge University Press. p. 315. Letter 1681 of 1 January 1919."]}, {"page": "H\u00e9lder Queiroz", "response": ["Queiroz received his doctorate in 2000 from St. Andrews University, Scotland, in Environmental And Evolutionary Biology, with the thesis \"Natural history and conservation of pirarucu, Arapaima gigas, at the Amazonian v\u00e1rzea: Red giants in muddy waters\". His advisor was the population biologist Anne E. Magurran."]}]}}
