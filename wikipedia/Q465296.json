She was initially recognised for her collaborations with William Orbit, Andrew Weatherall, Red Snapper and the Chemical Brothers in the mid-1990s. Her UK/US first solo album, Trailer Park, received much critical acclaim in 1996. Orton developed a devoted audience with the release of the BRIT Award-winning album Central Reservation (1999) and the 2002 UK top 10 album, Daybreaker. Her 2006 album, Comfort of Strangers, was followed by a break during which Orton gave birth to her daughter and collaborated with the British guitarist Bert Jansch. Orton returned with Sugaring Season in 2012, which moved towards a purer acoustic sound, followed by a return to electronic music with Kidsticks, released in 2016.\nOrton's music has been featured in Felicity, How to Deal, Charmed, Dawson's Creek, Roswell, Vanilla Sky and Grey's Anatomy, providing her with exposure to a more mainstream American audience.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 14", "response": ["*  1970   \u2013 Beth Orton, English singer-songwriter and guitarist"]}, {"page": "Eden Project", "response": ["|Beth Orton and Six by Seven"]}, {"page": "Trip hop", "response": ["Trip hop has also influenced artists in other genres, including Gorillaz, Emancipator, Nine Inch Nails, Travis, PJ Harvey, How to Destroy Angels, Beth Orton, The Flaming Lips, Bitter:Sweet, Beck, The xx and Deftones.
