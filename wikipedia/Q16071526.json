He played as a centre forward or inside forward. He was on the books of Bolton Wanderers and Accrington Stanley without representing either club in the league, and also played in the Southern League for Pontypridd and in the Midland League for Mansfield Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Blackpool F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Jimmy Heathcote"]}, {"page": "1918\u201319 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["As with the previous wartime seasons, Blackpool had to rely on a small nucleus of players supplemented by soldiers stationed in the town and the occasional league players as guests to make up the numbers. Again, they also had to rely on staff from the Royal Army Medical Corps Depot (RAMC) based at Squires Gate. Three of the players who made their debuts for the club in the 1918\u201319 season \u2014 Jimmy Heathcote, Harry Mingay and Eugene O'Doherty \u2014 went on to sign professional terms with the club for the 1919\u201320 season, as did Edmund Berry and Horace Fairhurst, who had made their debuts the previous season, as well as striker Thomas Hunter.", "Blackpool began the campaign on 7 September 1918, with a home match against Oldham Athletic, which they lost 4\u20131, and Bolton completed the double over the Seasiders in the following match with a 2\u20131 win at Burnden Park on 14 September. As with previous wartime seasons, they found team selection a problem, and by the sixth game had used twenty different players. Against Port Vale on 28 September they had only ten players and had to borrow a player from the home side. They remained without a win in the first nine games (three draws and six losses), which saw them in last place, and it took until 9 November for their first victory, 3\u20131 at home to Oldham Athletic. They followed that up with a double over Blackburn Rovers, beating them at Ewood Park 3\u20130 on 16 November and then a week later at Bloomfield Road, 2\u20130. However, they followed this up with three consecutive defeats, and after a 5\u20131 win over Rochdale on 21 December, by mid-February 1919 they had won only two further games. Jimmy Heathcote, who was at the time a soldier based at the RAMC Depot, made his debut for the club on 8 February in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Burnley, a game which also saw the return of Horace Fairhurst. In the return fixture, another RAMC soldier, Harry Mingay, made his debut in goal in a 3\u20130 defeat. He was the club's goalkeeper for the final seven games of the season as they won five and lost two. Both he and Heathcote signed professional terms with the club at the end of the season. On 15 Mar Blackpool played Liverpool at Anfield, and although the Seasiders lost 3\u20131, the game was notable for its being played in front of the largest wartime crowd: 24,000. With five wins in six games, Blackpool moved off the bottom of the table and the club's directors declared: \"The appeal was made to them to favour us with three home victories has not been in vain, and they unselfishly threw in two away victories for make-weight. Truly they deserve our unstinting praise, which every Blackpool supporter will disperse individually and collectively.\" However, they ended the season with a 5\u20131 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford and finished the season in 11th place, with Everton crowned champions.", "Over the four wartime seasons, Blackpool had used a total of 153 different players in the 145 official wartime games, plus at least another 21 in friendly games. Bobby Booth made the most appearances, playing in 88 official plus six other games. Jack Connor played in 76 official plus eight other games, Joe Bainbridge 73 plus four and Jimmy Jones 68 plus four. Of the soldiers who appeared, Dunn played in the most games, 59 plus five. Seven of the soldiers who had played for Blackpool in the wartime seasons went on to sign professional terms with the club \u2014 Edmund Berry, Horace Fairhurst, Jimmy Heathcote, Thomas Hunter, Henry Mingay, Albert Moorcroft and Eugene O'Doherty."]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["Jimmy Heathcote was the club's top scorer, with eighteen goals."]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Jimmy Heathcote"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Heathcoate", "response": ["#REDIRECTJimmy Heathcote"]}, {"page": "James Heathcoate", "response": ["#REDIRECTJimmy Heathcote"]}, {"page": "James Heathcote", "response": ["#REDIRECTJimmy Heathcote"]}]}}
