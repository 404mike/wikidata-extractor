HarperPerennial, 1996 (p.316).  Sheila Johnston's assessment of Dirty Weekend was also negative: \"no window-dressing can hide the fact that an aura of indelible naffness hangs over the movie...the screenplay is hewn out from Helen Zahavi's over-written novel with no concessions to the way people actually speak\". Johnston argued Dirty Weekend was inferior to other female revenge films such as Ms. 45 and Lipstick.  Johnston also criticised the making up of the white actor Richardson with \"brownface\" to portray a Middle Easterner. The Observer review claimed Dirty Weekend has \"a certain factitious topicality\", but went on to state \"a work so bad in every way, and mostly risibly so, cannot be the focus of serious controversy\". Brian Case, reviewing the film for Time Out, dismissed Dirty Weekend as \"pretty rotten\", and criticised Winner's direction, stating it resembled \"out-takes from local cinema advertising, which distances the audience from the material and indeed from wakefulness itself\".\"Dirty Weekend\", in Time Out Film Guide 2011, Time Out, London, 2010.
