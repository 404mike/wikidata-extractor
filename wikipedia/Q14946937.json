White was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast. He was born at Putney, London.\nWhile studying at the University of Cambridge, White played two first-class matches for the university cricket club, both against Yorkshire at Fenner's in 1913 and 1914. In his first match he took what would be his only first-class five wicket haul with figures of 5/75 in Yorkshire's first-innings of the match. He later played a single first-class match for Surrey against Oxford University at The Oval in 1926, though without success.\nHe died at East Grinstead, Sussex on 6 November 1968.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack White (disambiguation)", "response": ["Jack White (born 1975) is an American musician and singer-songwriter.", "Jack White may also refer to:", "*Jack White (cricketer, born 1891) (1891\u20131961), English cricket captain", "*Jack White (cricketer, born 1893) (1893\u20131968), English cricketer", "*Jack White (cricketer, born 1992) (born 1992), English cricketer", "*Jack White (Australian cricketer) (born 1999), Australian cricketer", "*Jack White (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u20131933), Australian rules footballer for St Kilda", "*Jack White (footballer, born 1912) (1912\u20131982), Australian rules footballer for Hawthorn", "*Jack White (footballer, born 1879) (1879\u2013?), English footballer", "*Jack White (footballer, born 1924) (1924\u20132011), English footballer", "*Jack White (basketball) (born 1997), Australian basketball player", "*Jack White (infielder) (1905\u20131971), 1920s baseball infielder", "*Jack White (outfielder) (1878\u20131963), 1900s baseball outfielder", "*Jack White (golfer) (1873\u20131949), Scottish golfer", "*Jack White (racing driver) (1920\u20131988), American stock car racing driver", "*Jack White (politician), Canadian labour activist", "*Jack White (reporter) (1942\u20132005), American investigative reporter", "*Jack White (trade unionist) (1879\u20131946), Irish activist and co-founder of the Irish Citizen's Army", "*Jack White (VC) (1896\u20131949), UK soldier, recognized for bravery in First World War", "*Jack White (film producer) (1897\u20131984), film producer at Columbia Pictures (a.k.a.
