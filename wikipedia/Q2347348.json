Entrants for the Contest were selected by a national selection, organised by the Maltese broadcaster PBS from 2003 to 2010. In 2013, the country opted for an internal selection since the broadcaster decided to return to the contest at a rather late stage (25 September 2013). PBS chose Gaia Cauchi as the 2013 Maltese representative. Malta won the contest twice, in 2013 and 2015, making it one of the most successful countries in the contest. They've also hosted the contest twice, in 2014 and 2016.", "|Sarah Harrison"]}, {"page": "List of Junior Eurovision Song Contest entries", "response": ["|align=left|Sarah Harrison"]}]}}
