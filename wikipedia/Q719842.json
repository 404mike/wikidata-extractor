After starting his career with local clubs near his home town of Blackpool, in 1932 he was signed by First Division Manchester City, with whom he played his entire professional career.\nSwift broke into the Manchester City first team in 1933, taking part in the club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2\u20131 against Portsmouth. Three years later Swift won a League Championship medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. War denied Swift several years of playing in his prime, though during wartime he was chosen to represent his country in international matches. After the war he made his competitive international debut, playing 19 internationals between 1946 and 1949.\nSwift retired in 1949, taking up a career in journalism as a football correspondent for the News of the World. He died, aged 44, in the Munich air disaster after reporting on Manchester United's European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 26", "response": ["*1913 \u2013 Frank Swift, English footballer and journalist (d. 1958)"]}, {"page": "February 6", "response": ["**Frank Swift, English footballer and journalist (b. 1913)"]}, {"page": "1913", "response": ["* December 26 \u2013 Frank Swift, English footballer (d. 1958)"]}, {"page": "1958", "response": ["** Frank Swift (born 1913)"]}, {"page": "Munich air disaster", "response": ["A few of the players were not confident fliers, particularly Liam Whelan, who said, \"This may be death, but I'm ready\".

The 21st victim was Frank Swift, a journalist and former goalkeeper who played with Busby at Manchester City; he died on his way to hospital. Duncan Edwards died from his injuries on 21 February at the Rechts der Isar Hospital in Munich, and the final death toll reached 23 several days later when co-pilot Ken Rayment died as a result of serious head injuries. Johnny Berry and Jackie Blanchflower were both injured so severely that they never played again.Hall, p. 340. Matt Busby was seriously injured and had to stay in hospital for more than two months after the crash, and was given the Last Rites twice.Barnes et al., p. 17. After being discharged from hospital, he went to Switzerland to recuperate in Interlaken. At times, he felt like giving up football entirely, until he was told by his wife, Jean, \"You know Matt, the lads would have wanted you to carry on.\"Morrin, p. 155. That statement lifted Busby from his depression, and he returned by land and sea to Manchester, before watching his team play in the 1958 FA Cup Final."]}, {"page": "Manchester City F.C.", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Frank Swift             || GK", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Frank Swift || goalkeeper || player || 1933\u20131949"]}, {"page": "List of fatalities from aviation accidents", "response": ["|Manchester United||United Kingdom ||1958||23 people total; including eight footballers: Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor, and Billy Whelan; coach Bert Whalley, trainer Tom Curry, and club secretary Walter Crickmer.
