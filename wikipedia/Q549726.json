After the war's conclusion, Hermann Prey and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau appeared on the scene to take their place. In addition to his interpretations of lieder and the works of Mozart, Prey sang in Strauss operas and tackled lighter Wagner roles such as Wolfram or Beckmesser. Fischer-Dieskau sang parts in 'fringe' operas by the likes of Ferruccio Busoni and Paul Hindemith as well as appearing in standard works by Verdi and Wagner. He earned his principal renown, however, as a lieder singer. Talented German and Austrian lieder singers of a younger generation include Olaf B\u00e4r, Matthias Goerne, Wolfgang Holzmair (who also performs regularly in opera), Thomas Quasthoff,  and Christian Gerhaher. Well-known non-Germanic baritones of recent times have included the Italians Giorgio Zancanaro and Leo Nucci, the Frenchman Fran\u00e7ois le Roux, the Canadians Gerald Finley and James Westman and the versatile American Thomas Hampson, his compatriot Nathan Gunn and the Englishman Simon Keenlyside."]}, {"page": "War Requiem", "response": ["* LSO Live: Sabina Cvilak, Ian Bostridge, Simon Keenlyside; London Symphony Chorus, Choir of Eltham College, London Symphony Orchestra; Gianandrea Noseda, conductor (2011)"]}, {"page": "Aeolian Quartet", "response": ["Raymond Keenlyside (the father of the baritone Simon Keenlyside) was also a leader of the Boyd Neel and English Chamber Orchestras.
