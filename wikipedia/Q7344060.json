He spent his first seven years in the employment of a G Angus, bookseller and printer of The Side, Newcastle, where he had as a fellow apprentice, Robert Emery. It was during this period that Emery wrote his song about \"The Great Frost on the River Tyne\" which caused the river to freeze over during January and February 1814. Binney is credited by Thomas Allan, in his Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings with finishing off the song. After his time with the bookseller, he entered the theological school of Wymondley College, Hertfordshire, later incorporated in New College, Hampstead."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Robert Emery (1794\u20131871), songwriter"]}, {"page": "Edward Corvan", "response": ["*The Curds and Cream-house GhostAllan's Tyneside Songs ascribes this song to Robert Emery"]}, {"page": "Hydrophobie (song)", "response": [" Hydrophobie  (or sometimes called \u201cThe Skipper and the Quaker\") is a Geordie folk song written in the 19th century by Robert Emery, in a style deriving from music hall."]}, {"page": "Robert Nunn (songwriter)", "response": ["He was a skillful performer, famed for his playing-up to women.

He composed songs to perform, and would sing songs written by others, as well. One of his fellow songwriters, Robert Emery, wrote of him in his song, \"The Sandgate Lassie's Lament\".
