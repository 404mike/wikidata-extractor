He started playing professionally in college while pursuing a degree in chemistry. In 1946 he moved to England, where he became a member of the BBC Show Band. During the 1960s and 1970s, he was a member of the Hot Club of London, led by guitarist Diz Disley, which often collaborated with St\u00e9phane Grappelli. He was a member of the band Velvet with Digby Fairweather, Len Skeat, and Denny Wright. In the 1980s, he moved to Australia and taught at the Sydney School of Guitar.He died of cancer in January 1996, at the age of 76.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St\u00e9phane Grappelli", "response": ["In 1973, British guitarist Diz Disley had the idea of prising Grappelli away from his \"lounge jazz\" format with piano players to play once again with the backing of acoustic guitars and double bass, re-creating a version of the \"Hot Club\" sound, but now with Grappelli as sole leader. Grappelli's reservations about returning to this format were dissipated following a rapturous reception for the \"new\" (old) format group at that year's Cambridge Folk Festival, after which he favoured the guitar-based trio (with double bass) for a series of increasingly successful concert tours around the globe. These tours would virtually occupy the remainder of Grappelli's life; away from the touring circuit, however, he also favoured numerous other instrumental combinations on record. Other guitarists in the British \"Diz Disley Trio\" providing his instrumental backing over the years included Denny Wright, Ike Isaacs, the Irish guitarist Louis Stewart, John Etheridge and Martin Taylor, while double bass was often provided by Dutchman Jack Sewing; in his later years, Grappelli also used a Parisian trio which included guitarist Marc Fosset and bassist Patrice Carratini."]}, {"page": "List of jazz guitarists", "response": ["* Ike Isaacs"]}, {"page": "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?

With Ike Isaacs he appeared on Ken Sykora's Guitar Club on BBC Radio for a number of years and was voted second best (1960) and best (1961) British jazz guitarist in the UK Melody Maker jazz polls.", "In 1973, he was influential in persuading Quintette du Hot Club de France violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli to return to public performances using an all-strings acoustic line-up, recreating the spirit of the Quintette for a new generation of listeners. Before this, Grappelli had spent a number of years playing \"cocktail jazz\" in a Paris hotel. After a couple of \"warm up\" gigs in small folk clubs, they played together to an unexpectedly warm reception at the 1973 Cambridge Folk Festival with Denny Wright on second acoustic guitar. This began a collaboration between Grappelli and the Diz Disley Trio, sometimes billed The Hot Club of London, with tours of Australia, Europe, and the United States. Karl Dallas reported Disley as having \"single-handedly created a revival of interest in the music of Stephane Grappelli, which has taken him to Carnegie Hall, Australia, and New Zealand\" (the latter in September 1974). \"...the night he closed at the Palladium, he went to The Troubadour where he was booked later that night to perform his folk club act of idiocy and mayhem, keeping up the tradition he has built up over the past 20 years for delivering a shrewd mixture of musical brilliance and vocal insanity.\"Karl Dallas, Melody Maker, July 27, 1974, \"Disley - still making whoopee\" There were a few changes in line-up with Ike Isaacs, Louis Stewart, and John Etheridge alternating as second guitarist. The Disley Trio accompanied Grappelli for another five years until Disley was forced to take a break in 1979 after breaking his wrist when he was knocked down by a motorcycle in London. His replacement was a young Martin Taylor, who toured with Grappelli for ten years. During that period, Disley continued to play folk clubs and festivals as a solo performer and also mentored a young Chris Newman, who would establish his own name in the swing jazz, guitar flatpicking and celtic folk guitar fields."]}, {"page": "Digby Fairweather", "response": ["He led his first band, Dig's Half Dozen, in 1971 and recorded in 1973 with Alex Welsh.
