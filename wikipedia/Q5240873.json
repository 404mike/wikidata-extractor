Its editorial collective sometimes has divergent views on the topics the magazine addresses but generally shares an anarchist, anti-authoritarian outlook and a non-dogmatic, action-oriented approach to change. The title implies that the periodical is an alternative to the fourth estate (traditional print journalism).\nFifth Estate is frequently cited as the longest running English language anarchist publication in North America, although this is sometimes disputed since it became only explicitly anti-authoritarian in 1975 after ten years of publishing as part of the 1960s Underground Press movement. The archives for the Fifth Estate are held at the Labadie Collection in Ann Arbor, Michigan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fifth Estate (periodical)", "response": ["By 1980, the paper had become more anti-technological and anti-civilisation, something for which it was well known throughout the 1980s. It was the focal point for the development of the political trend of anarcho-primitivism. Long-time contributor John Zerzan published his seminal essays on time, language, art, number and agriculture in the magazine. His articles were frequently accompanied by long critiques by George Bradford (n\u00e9e David Watson) or Bob Brubaker, who developed different versions of primitivism. After Zerzan's 1988 article on agriculture, he started publishing his new essays in Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed. Dismayed by what he saw as the excesses of Zerzan and others, Watson eventually repudiated primitivism in his 1997 essay \"Swamp Fever\".\"Swamp Fever: Primitivism & the Ideological Vortex\", Fifth Estate #350 (vol 32, #2), Fall 1997. pp 15\u201325 However, as of 2012, Zerzan began publishing articles in the Fifth Estate again on subjects as varied as the Black Bloc, the sea, and the Luddites.", "*David Watson, longtime Fifth Estate writer and editorial collective member"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (D\u2013H)", "response": ["* David Watson (anarchist)"]}, {"page": "Fredy Perlman", "response": ["* David Watson (anarchist)"]}, {"page": "David Watson", "response": ["David Watson may refer to:", "* David Watson (Queensland politician) (born 1945), Australian politician", "* David Watson (New South Wales politician) (1870\u20131924), Australian Senator", "* David Watson (footballer, born 1946), English footballer of the 1970s and 1980s, played for Sunderland A.F.C.", "* David Watson (footballer, born 1973), English football goalkeeper of the 1990s, played for Barnsley F.C.", "* David Watson (coach) (born 1976), American football coach", "* David Watson (1920s rugby league) (1900\u20131982), Australian rugby player", "* David Watson (cricketer) (1919\u20131943), English cricketer", "* David Watson (rugby union) (1854\u20131906), Scotland international rugby union player", "* David Watson (actor) (1940\u20132014), American actor of film, television and theatre", "* David Watson (dancer) (born 1968), professional dancer", "* David Watson (artist) (born 1944), English industrial painter", "* David Watson (British musician), record producer, singer and musician", "* David Watson (New Zealand musician) (born 1960), musician and composer from New Zealand", "* David Watson (anarchist) (born 1951), anarchist author", "* David Watson (evangelist) (1933\u20131984), English evangelist and author", "* Sir David Watson (general) (1869\u20131922), Canadian World War I general", "* David Watson (psychologist), American psychologist", "* David Watson (academic) (1949\u20132015), principal of Green Templeton College, Oxford, UK"]}, {"page": "Issues in anarchism", "response": ["Murray Bookchin's work on social ecology, David Watson's work with Fifth Estate magazine, Steve Booth's work in the United Kingdom publication Green Anarchist and Graham Purchase's writings on green syndicalism have all contributed to the broad variety and scope of green anarchist/eco-anarchist thought and action.

They proposed differing theories about how it became an industrial society, and not capitalism as such, that was at the root of contemporary social problems. This theory was developed in the journal Fifth Estate in the 1970s and 1980s, and was influenced by the Frankfurt School, the Situationist International, Jacques Ellul and others.", "*David Watson, Against the Megamachine, Brooklyn: Autonomedia, 1998,  - The title essay is available online here"]}]}}
