This was the inception of the paramedic service in the UK, and subsequently was developed across Europe. In 1986 the NHSTA introduced the certificate in Extended Ambulance Aid. Existing AEMT Paramedics were forced to sit a conversion examination. The curriculum for the new qualification was substantially smaller cutting out a lot of anatomy and physiology as well as pharmacology and obstetrics. In November 1986 the examinations took place with the first certificates issued alphabetically. The candidate with highest score received certificate 177 and was the only Paramedic at Huntingdon. Training was introduced the following year but due to costs the time was kept to a minimum. The AEMT folded in the 1990s as the training offered was no longer recognised by the ambulance services. Equipment owned by the branches was given to hospitals."]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Douglas Chamberlain, cardiologist, lives in Hove and worked at the Royal Sussex County Hospital for more than 20 years"]}, {"page": "Emergency medical personnel in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Dr. Peter Baskett was one of the world's leading figures in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and pre-hospital medical care.

Baskett travelled extensively learning about other pre-hospital care schemes in other countries such as Germany and Denmark. Meanwhile, general practitioners (primary care doctors) with strong leadership from Kenneth Easton, were founding GP-based-schemes which, in due course, led to the foundation of the British Association for Immediate Care Schemes (BASICS). Baskett was a founder member of this organisation and was later Chairman. He was also a founder member of the Community Resuscitation Advisory Committee (CRAC). The constitution of this committee was amended in May 1984 giving rise to the Resuscitation Council (UK) - the first Resuscitation Council in Europe. Five years later, Peter was one of the Founding Members of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and, in August 1989, at the first Executive Committee meeting of the ERC, he was elected chairman."]}]}}
