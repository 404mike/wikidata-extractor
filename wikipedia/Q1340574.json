His performance as Regimental Sergeant Major Wilson in The Hill (1965) alongside Sean Connery earned Andrews the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor and a nomination for the 1966 BAFTA Award for Best British Actor. The first of his more than 80 film appearances was in The Red Beret in 1953.\nPrior to his film career, Andrews was a theatre actor, appearing at such venues as the Queen's Theatre, the Lyceum Theatre, and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in the UK as well as theatres in New York City, Paris, Antwerp and Brussels. Andrews made his London theatre debut in 1935 at the St James's Theatre and his New York debut in 1936 at the Empire Theatre.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marlon Brando", "response": ["Brando cited Burn! (1969) as his personal favorite of the films he had made, writing in his autobiography, \"I think I did some of the best acting I've ever done in that picture, but few people came to see it.\" Brando dedicated a full chapter to the film in his memoir, stating that the director, Gillo Pontecorvo, was the best director with whom he had ever worked, next to Kazan and Bernardo Bertolucci. Brando also detailed his clashes with Pontecorvo on the set and how \"we nearly killed each other.\" Loosely based on events in the history of Guadeloupe, the film got a hostile reception from critics. In 1971, Michael Winner directed him in the British horror film The Nightcomers with Stephanie Beacham, Thora Hird, Harry Andrews and Anna Palk. It is a prequel to The Turn of the Screw, which later became the 1961 film The Innocents. Brando's performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor BAFTA, but the film bombed at the box office."]}, {"page": "1989", "response": ["* March 6 \u2013 Harry Andrews, British actor (b. 1911)"]}, {"page": "An Inspector Calls", "response": ["An Inspector Calls was first performed in 1945 in two Russian theatres (Moscow's Kamerny Theatre and Leningrad's Comedy Theatre), as a suitable British venue could not be found.
