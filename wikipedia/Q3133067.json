He was educated at Charterhouse School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he won an oratory gold medal. He joined his father in the banking business of Henry S. King & Co. This had been established in 1868, when his father Henry Samuel King took over the banking and India agency work of Smith Elder & Co, booksellers, stationers, East India agents, shippers, and bankers. When his father died in 1878 King became senior partner. He expanded the business which was based on Bombay and Calcutta, to Port Said, Delhi and Simla. He was a well-known banker in London, Bombay and Calcutta. One distinction of the bank was the employment of women as typists, as early as 1887, something which most other banks did not do until the First World War. King also acquired two Indian newspapers - the Overland Mail and the Homeward Mail,  which were founded by John William Kaye, the historian of the Indian Mutiny. King's brother in law Edward Jenkins, a former MP for Dundee, became editor of these in 1886.\n\nKing was an adventurous mountaineer. He was the first to reach the summits of Mont Maudit with William Edward Davidson and guides Johann Jaun d. J. and Johann von Bergen on 12 September 1878, and Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey (Pointe G\u00fcssfeldt) with guides Emile Rey, Ambros Supersaxo and Aloys Anthamatten on 31 July 1885. The SE summit of the Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey (4,107 metres (13,474 ft)) is named Point Seymour King in his honour.\nHe lived in the Manor House, Chigwell, Essex, England. In 1885 King was elected Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull Central. Having previously been a Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (C.I.E.), he was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (K.C.I.E.) on 15 August 1892. King was the first Mayor of Kensington in 1900 and provided a large interest free loan for the purchase of slum properties in North Kensington so that they could be rebuilt and refurbished. He retained his parliamentary seat until December 1910, when he was unseated on petition on 1 June 1911.King became a director of Lloyds Bank in 1909. After the First World War, he arranged an amalgamation with Messrs Cox & Co, a rival bank and Indian agency. Lloyds absorbed the banking arm of the merged company in February 1923, resulting in the foundation of the Eastern Department of Lloyds with sixteen main branches in India and Burma.  The travel side of the business continued as Cox & Kings. King's leisure interests extended to sailing and yachting.  King was chairman of the Income Tax Commissioners for the City of London and in recognition of his services was created a Baronet in the 1932 King's Birthday Honours.  He was also a member of the Commission of Lieutenancy for the City of London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry King", "response": ["* Seymour King (Henry Seymour King, 1852\u20131933), English banker, mountaineer and Conservative Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Seymour King "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir Seymour King "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Seymour King "]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Seymour King (1852\u20131933), MP for Kingston upon Hull Central (1885\u20131911)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Seymour King "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1900 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Seymour King "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Seymour King "]}, {"page": "Kingston upon Hull Central (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| 1885 || Seymour King || Conservative", "thumb|120px|Seymour King"]}, {"page": "1969 in poetry", "response": ["* Seymour King"]}, {"page": "Sir Henry King, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Seymour King"]}, {"page": "Sir Seymour King, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Seymour King"]}, {"page": "Henry Seymour King", "response": ["#REDIRECT Seymour King"]}, {"page": "1911 Kingston upon Hull Central by-election", "response": ["Seymour King the Conservative MP since 1885 was unseated on petition on 1 June 1911."]}, {"page": "List of UK Parliamentary election petitions", "response": ["| December 1910 || Kingston upon Hull Central || Marriott Morley, Charles Wray, and Benjamin Musgrave || Sir Henry Seymour King || Bribery, etc. || Void election || King had celebrated his 25th anniversary as MP for the constituency shortly before the election.

In 2014, the police received four reports of the alleged offence. In the 2010s, there have been some modern examples of the offence. In April 2015, the Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman (Tower Hamlets First) was found guilty of a number of electoral fraud offences, including treating, during the 2014 Tower Hamlets mayoral election which resulted in an election court declaring the result of the election null and void leading to Rahman being removed from office.  An accusation of treating was seen in the 2015 United Kingdom general election where the UK Independence Party candidate for Southampton Itchen, Kim Rose was accused of treating for giving out sausage rolls at a community event; however, Hampshire Constabulary said they would take no action over the allegation. The UKIP leader Nigel Farage criticised the allegation of treating."]}, {"page": "Alexander Strahan", "response": ["Born in Edinburgh, he was a Scottish Presbyterian.
