In international terms his greatest sporting achievement was winning a bronze medal for hockey at the 1908 Summer Olympics as a member of the Scotland hockey team. However it was for cricket that he was best known, as a veteran cricket captain for a leading Scottish cricket club. Between 1902 and 1948 he was Captain of Edinburgh\u2019s Carlton Cricket Club for a total of 29 seasons, retiring at the age of 73. At every stage of his long captaincy there were years when Carlton won over 80% of their matches.  He was \u201cone of the great characters of Scottish cricket\u201d according to The Encyclopedia of Scottish Cricket. Carlton members dubbed him the \u2018W.G. Grace\u2019 of Scottish cricket in comparison with England\u2019s famously long playing cricketer. Stevenson also wrote a substantial book about the Scottish cricket of his era which has remained in use as a reference book into the 21st century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Field hockey at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Norman Stevenson"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|rowspan=2 bgcolor=cc9966| 3rd ||align=left|   Alexander Burt, John Burt, Alastair Denniston, Charles Foulkes, Hew Fraser, James Harper-Orr, Ivan Laing, Hugh Neilson, William Orchardson, Norman Stevenson, Hugh Walker || Won vs.  Germany  4-0 || Lost vs.  England  6-1 ||rowspan=2 bgcolor=lightgray| Did not advance ||rowspan=2 bgcolor=lightgray| Not relegated"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in field hockey", "response": ["| Alexander BurtJohn BurtAlastair DennistonCharles FoulkesHew FraserJames Harper-OrrIvan LaingHugh NeilsonWilliam OrchardsonNorman StevensonHugh Walker"]}, {"page": "List of 1908 Summer Olympics medal winners", "response": ["| Alexander BurtJohn BurtAlastair DennistonCharles FoulkesHew FraserJames Harper-OrrIvan LaingHugh NeilsonWilliam OrchardsonNorman StevensonHugh Walker"]}, {"page": "Scotland men's national field hockey team", "response": ["* Norman Stevenson"]}]}}
