He was born in Milnsbridge into a wealthy Yorkshire family in 1900, the heir to a successful textiles business which funded his motor racing and other sporting exploits. He is famous for being the only driver to successfully complete the full 24 hours of the 24 Hours of Le Mans race solo, a feat he achieved in 1950. He lived at  Kirkburton, near Huddersfield until leaving the United Kingdom on his retirement in the early 1950s to live, initially in South Africa, later in Canada and then Monte Carlo, where he had an apartment overlooking the harbour and part of the Grand Prix circuit. He was married twice, first to Evelyn Muriel (divorced in 1931) and secondly in 1933 to divorc\u00e9e Joan Evelyn Quarmby (n\u00e9e Goddard) who survived him on his death in 1982.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brooklands", "response": ["*Edward Ramsden Hall (racing driver)"]}, {"page": "Edward Hall (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Edward Ramsden Hall (1900\u20131982), British racing driver and Olympic bobsledder"]}, {"page": "E.R.

He had taken the Bentley 3\u00bd-Litre; to Italy for a Mille Miglia practice (to save his M.G. for the race itself  ), and was impressed by its performance. It was the first new Bentley model or Derby Bentley after Rolls-Royce acquired Bentley in 1931, and was known as the silent sports car. The company was initially reluctant, but Arthur Sidgreaves agreed and Rolls-Royce supplied a support team. Rowbotham thought the project sheer lunacy as a lone entry could be forced off the road by a works entry or a minor mechanical fault, and the Engineering Department knew nothing about racing (the last Rolls-Royce entries in a TT race were on the Isle of Man in 1905 and 1906 \u2013 winning in 1906). He would be responsible for the car, which was prepared in the factory and then a non-stop 12 hours endurance run; the power of the slightly hotted-up engine was increased from 114 bhp to 131 bhp.
