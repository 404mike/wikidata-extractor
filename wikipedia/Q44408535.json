In 1970 Pelican Books published the volumes of David Hume's History of Great Britain that covered the early Stuarts, to which Forbes wrote the introduction.In his book Hume's Philosophical Politics, Forbes argued that Hume's main purpose in writing The History of England was to give \"the Hanoverian regime a proper intellectual foundation\". Against the traditional portrayal of Hume as a Tory, Forbes labelled Hume's beliefs \"skeptical Whiggism\", that is, an acceptance of the Revolution Settlement coupled with a rejection of most other Whig orthodoxies such as the concept of the \"ancient constitution\".Forbes' work on the Scottish Enlightenment led to one of his students, John Dunn, calling him \"a Highlander in exile\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Duncan Forbes", "response": ["Duncan Forbes may refer to:", "*Duncan Forbes of Culloden (politician, died 1654), Scottish politician and burgh commissioner for Inverness", "*Duncan Forbes of Culloden (politician, born 1644) (1644\u20131704), Scottish politician and supporter of the House of Hanover, grandson of the above", "*Duncan Forbes of Culloden (judge, born 1685) (1685\u20131747), Scottish politician and judge, son of the above", "*Duncan Forbes (linguist) (1798\u20131868), Scottish linguist", "*Duncan Forbes (historian) (1922\u20131994), Scottish historian", "*Duncan Forbes (footballer) (1941\u20132019), Scottish footballer", "*Duncan Forbes (poet) (born 1947), British poet"]}, {"page": "Stephen Houlgate", "response": ["*Duncan Forbes (historian)"]}]}}
