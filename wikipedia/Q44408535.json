In 1970 Pelican Books published the volumes of David Hume's History of Great Britain that covered the early Stuarts, to which Forbes wrote the introduction.In his book Hume's Philosophical Politics, Forbes argued that Hume's main purpose in writing The History of England was to give \"the Hanoverian regime a proper intellectual foundation\". Against the traditional portrayal of Hume as a Tory, Forbes labelled Hume's beliefs \"skeptical Whiggism\", that is, an acceptance of the Revolution Settlement coupled with a rejection of most other Whig orthodoxies such as the concept of the \"ancient constitution\".Forbes' work on the Scottish Enlightenment led to one of his students, John Dunn, calling him \"a Highlander in exile\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
