The change of actor was written in as part of the story when Jamie is turned into a cardboard cut-out and has his face removed by the Master of the Land of Fiction. The Doctor's first attempt to reconstruct his face is unsuccessful. Eventually, Jamie's real face is restored when Hines recovered.Wilson trained as an actor at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and his early work includes an appearance on the first series of The Vital Spark (in the only surviving episode of that series, 1966's \"A Drop O' The Real Stuff\"). At the time of his Doctor Who appearance, he was working in London for a furniture removal firm. His other work includes numerous TV guest appearances in programmes such as Softly, Softly and Monarch of the Glen, and involvement in the documentary and the audio commentary on the 2005 DVD release of \"The Mind Robber\". Wilson also acted in Greyfriars Bobby (1961) and TimeLock (2013). Starting in the 1970s, Wilson became a radio producer, working with Radio Forth and Radio Clyde before moving to the BBC's Scottish radio drama unit in Edinburgh in 1989, where he made programmes for BBC Radio Scotland as well as BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4. He received a fellowship from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in 1996. He was also a staff member at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Paul YoungPaul CurranHamish WilsonBrian CoxHenry Stamper"]}, {"page": "Jamie McCrimmon", "response": ["During the filming of The Mind Robber, Frazer Hines contracted chickenpox and was replaced for part of the serial by Hamish Wilson.
