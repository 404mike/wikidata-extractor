However Slaven picked up a calf strain in pre-season and lost his first team place to Stuart Ripley. He regained his first team place early in September after scoring three goals as a substitute against Portsmouth and Oxford United. On 28 September, he scored the opening goal in a 2\u20131 victory over rivals Sunderland. However Lawrence felt that Slaven was too individualistic, and in November he spent \u00a3700,000 on Hull City striker Andy Payton, who he hoped would prove to be an effective striker partner for Paul Wilkinson. Payton scored on his debut against Bristol City on 23 November, but Slaven claimed the other two goals in a 3\u20131 victory, and Payton left the field on a stretcher after picking up an injury. However Slaven injured his knee in January and after undergoing surgery was ruled out of action for five weeks. He scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win over Brighton on 21 March, but fell out with Lawrence and was dropped for the end of season promotion run-in. He returned for the crucial final game of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers however, and set up a late Jon Gittens equaliser, before a late winner from Wilkinson secured a 2\u20131 victory and the second automatic promotion place for Middlesbrough."]}, {"page": "Jason Wilcox", "response": ["Wilcox would go on to score 33 goals in over 300 games with Blackburn, whom he also captained. Wilcox was one of the only first-team players of that era who came from the club's own youth system and was not signed from other teams with the multimillion-pound investments of Jack Walker. He played an important part in the title-winning Blackburn team of 1995. Playing on the left flank with attacking fullback Graeme Le Saux behind him and Stuart Ripley on the opposite flank, they forged a strong attacking line-up with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton.

He made his Premier League debut for the club when he replaced Tim Sherwood in a 3\u20130 victory over Wimbledon F.C. in February 1994. Morrison started, and almost scored, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup. He subsequently replaced Kevin Moran in a 1\u20130 defeat to Arsenal (in which Paul Merson scored the winner) and David Batty in a 3\u20131 defeat to Southampton (in which Stuart Ripley scored Blackburn's goal). Morrison started for Blackburn in a 2\u20131 victory against West Ham United (in which Henning Berg and Ian Pearce scored Blackburn's goals) in April 1994. His last game for Blackburn was a 2\u20131 defeat to Coventry City, in May 1994, which ended Blackburn's title hopes that season. Morrison was given a 'torrid time' by Peter Ndlovu in the game and later claimed that Ndlovu had ruined his career with Blackburn. Morrison also played for Blackburn's reserve team, alongside Shay Given and former Plymouth teammate Nicky Marker. Morrison played in the reserve team defeat against Manchester United's reserve team, which featured Bryan Robson and Dion Dublin, in which Marker's tackle on Ben Thornley led to the latter being sidelined for over a year and ultimately to legal action. Morrison was unable to break into the Rovers side on a regular basis, as he faced competition from Colin Hendry, Henning Berg and Ian Pearce. Morrison began the 1994\u201395 season as a member of the Blackburn squad that went on to win the Premier League that season. He was an unused substitute in the 1994 FA Charity Shield in which Blackburn were beaten 2\u20130 by Manchester United after goals from Eric Cantona and Paul Ince. In December 1994 Morrison was bought by Sam Allardyce for Blackpool. The transfer fee was \u00a3245,000, which was then a Blackpool club-record.

His spell at Blackburn was unsuccessful, only making four appearances before he joined Portsmouth on loan and then Leicester City permanently in the 1992\u201393 season, when Rovers were in the new Premier League and Leicester were challenging for promotion from Division One. During his time at Blackburn, the club earned promotion to the Premier League, but Agnew's part in the success was a minimal one as the attention was focused on big-money new signings such as Mike Newell and Roy Wegerle and later Alan Shearer and Stuart Ripley. One of Agnew's most memorable nights in a Leicester City shirt was 15 April 1993, when Leicester beat Millwall 3\u20130. Agnew scored and was sent off. Agnew \"reacted angrily to a heavy challenge by Andy Roberts. At least a dozen players jostled each other as police, stewards and the respective managers tried to restore order. Agnew, who had already been cautioned, appeared to lash out at a Millwall player, leaving Mr Parker no option other than to reach for red.
