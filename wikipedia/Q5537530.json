With the bat he was rather less successful, making 8 and 4. He played a further seven games for Warwickshire that season, and though managed only another three wickets he ended with a bowling average of just 14.00. He did not contribute much with the bat: in all of 1912 he scored only 36 runs in 12 innings for a batting average of a 3.00. He also took the only catch of his entire career, to dismiss Sussex opener Robert Relf off the bowling of Willie Quaife.\nByrne played four more first-class matches in his career, two apiece in 1914 and 1921, but these appearances were for Worcestershire. His figures for the county are less than impressive (28 runs at 3.50; one wicket at 155.00), but nevertheless he might have played more for them had he not been constrained by his career as an officer in the Army. His only wicket for Worcestershire came on his debut for the county, against Leicestershire in July 1914, when he dismissed Arthur Mounteney.\nHe died in Torteval, Guernsey at the age of 81.\nHis uncle, James Byrne, had a more substantial first-class career, captaining Warwickshire between 1903 and 1907.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northfield, Birmingham", "response": ["* George Byrne \u2013 England cricketer."]}, {"page": "George Burns (disambiguation)", "response": ["*George Byrne (1892\u20131973), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Byrne", "response": ["*George Byrne, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Festival of the Sun", "response": ["* 2007 Line Up: included Gotye, Cog, Butterfingers, Clare Bowditch & The Feeding Set, Ash Grunwald, The Fumes, Kid Confucius, Subaudible Hum, The Boat People, Aurora Jane & Massive Change, The Sins, Tjupurru, Mr Percival and George Byrne"]}, {"page": "J.
