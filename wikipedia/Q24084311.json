Loan spells in League One with Oxford United, Shrewsbury Town and Walsall followed before he joined Leeds in January 2018. In the 2019-2020 season, Roberts was a member of the Leeds United Squad that won the EFL Championship and promotion to the Premier League under manager Marcelo Bielsa. He made his senior Wales debut in 2018, having previously represented the nation at various youth levels, and represented Wales at UEFA Euro 2020. A versatile forward, he can play as a striker, winger or as an attacking midfielder.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marcelo Bielsa", "response": ["On 28 April 2019, Bielsa made one of the most contentious managerial calls of the Championship season in Leeds' penultimate league game against Aston Villa at Elland Road. In the 72nd minute of a tight game between two teams who were essentially jostling for position in the playoffs, albeit Leeds 'mathematically' still able to gain automatic promotion, when Villa's Jonathan Kodjia was injured and remained on the ground, Tyler Roberts passed the ball up the line to Mateusz Klich who took it up the left wing and put the ball into the far corner past Jed Steer. The goal \u2013 the first of the game \u2013 sparked pandemonium, with Villa's Conor Hourihane, Ahmed Elmohamady, Neil Taylor and Leeds' Patrick Bamford caught up in a fracas with Klich at its centre, which involved several additional players from both sides and was eventually broken up by referee Stuart Attwell, Elland Road stewards and other players. In the immediate aftermath, Attwell sent off the peripherally involved Anwar El Ghazi with a straight red card (subsequently rescinded by The FA) and Bielsa's response to his players was, in the interests of fairness and after consulting with Villa boss Dean Smith, that his team should allow an unchallenged equaliser to be scored (the manager can be seen shouting \"Give the goal! Give the goal!\" from the touchline). From the restart, Albert Adomah essentially walked the ball into net unchallenged by 10 Leeds players, with only a frustrated and disbelieving Pontus Jansson giving chase and nearly dispossessing the forward. The game remained 1\u20131 and put the second automatic promotion spot mathematically out of reach for Leeds and see them enter the play-offs. Bielsa and the team were subsequently awarded the 2019 FIFA Fair Play Award on 23 September 2019, for their actions during this game, with the FIFA citation noting that \"The game finished 1\u20131, ultimately allowing their promotion rivals Sheffield United to guarantee their automatic spot in the Premier League, at Leeds\u2019 expense. What was at stake makes Bielsa's act of sportmanship all the more remarkable\"."]}, {"page": "1999 in Wales", "response": ["*12 January - Tyler Roberts, footballer"]}, {"page": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "response": ["Robson-Kanu, Tyler Roberts and Rabbi Matondo were all sent home from the Wales squad in March 2021 after breaching COVID-19 protocols.

Bamford played in all 38 league fixtures, starting almost every game, with Bielsa occasionally bringing on Tyler Roberts as a tactical substitute for him in the first few weeks of the season, and Rodrigo proving to be a prolifically goal-scoring substitute for Bamford in the season's final fixtures."]}, {"page": "List of Wales international footballers born outside Wales", "response": ["* Tyler Roberts"]}, {"page": "Stuart Dallas", "response": ["In June 2019, teammate Bailey Peacock-Farrell revealed he and Dallas had turned down the option of starting pre-season training a week later after featuring on international duty for Northern Ireland over the summer, in order to fight for a starting spot.

Dallas found himself one of the first names on the first team sheet, being ever present for the first half of the season, playing in a range of positions, including left-back, right-back, and central midfield after injuries to Adam Forshaw, Jamie Shackleton, Tyler Roberts and Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez. After the English professional football season was paused in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was resumed in June, where Dallas earned promotion with Leeds to the Premier League as EFL Championship champions.

This occurred after El Ghazi allegedly struck Leeds forward Patrick Bamford during an on pitch brawl following Mateusz Klich's controversial 72nd opening goal for Leeds United following Tyler Roberts' refusal to put the ball out of touch for an injury. The decision was met with controversy from fans and pundits alike, with Aston Villa head coach Dean Smith claiming that after reviewing the footage of the incident reported that he'd be 'amazed' if the red card and subsequent three-game ban weren't overturned after appeal. The red card and ban were later rescinded and on 2 May, Bamford was banned for two games for \"successful deception of a match official\"."]}]}}
