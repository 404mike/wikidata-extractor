He received some tuition in science at the home of Charles Fox.\nHenwood soon took an active interest in the working of mines and in the metalliferous deposits. He was funded by the Fox family and local gentry to survey Cornish mines. He developed a theory on how  metal lodes had been formed. Unfortunately, he saw Robert Were Fox, who was researching in the same field, as a plagiarist.In 1832 Henwood was appointed to the office of assay-master and supervisor of tin in the duchy of Cornwall, a post from which he retired in 1838. Meanwhile, he had commenced in 1826 to communicate papers on mining subjects to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, and the Geological Society of London, and in 1840 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society.In 1843 he went to take charge of the Gongo Soco mines in Brazil; afterwards he proceeded to India to report on certain metalliferous deposits for the Indian government; and in 1858, impaired in health, he retired and settled at Penzance.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mining in Cornwall and Devon", "response": ["*William Jory Henwood, mining geologist"]}, {"page": "Perranarworthal", "response": ["Notable people from Perranarworthal include Charles Fox (scientist) and Barclay Fox, managers of the Perran Foundry; Saint PiranSaint Pirran from Wikipedia 17.6.13 or Perran after whom Perran Foundry was named; the poet Jane Crewdson, n\u00e9e Fox, was born here; William Jory Henwood, mining geologist who was born at Perran Wharf; William Lobb (1809\u20131864), a plant collector who was responsible for the commercial introduction to England of the \"monkey puzzle\" tree Araucaria araucana and the Sequoiadendron giganteum.
