His stand-up comedy style was fast and relied on the rapid delivery of one-liner jokes. He said that his comic influences included other Liverpool comedians like Arthur Askey, Robb Wilton, Tommy Handley and the \"cheeky chappy\" from Brighton, Max Miller. He interspersed the comedy with occasional songs, both serious and humorous, in an incongruously fine light baritone voice, and with his original speciality, ventriloquism. Part of his stage act featured the Diddy Men (\"diddy\" being local slang for \"small\"). At first an unseen joke conceived as part of Dodd's imagination, they later appeared on stage, usually played by children."]}, {"page": "Robert Smith", "response": ["* Robert Wilton Smith (1881\u20131957), known as Robb Wilton, English comedian and comic actor"]}, {"page": "Everton, Liverpool", "response": ["*Robb Wilton, English comedian and actor"]}, {"page": "Robin Askwith", "response": ["Askwith is a great-nephew of the comic Robb Wilton."]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["* Robb Wilton: Comedian."]}, {"page": "List of British music hall performers", "response": ["* Robb Wilton (1881\u20131957)"]}, {"page": "George Robey", "response": ["Robey's comic delivery influenced other comedians, but opinions of his effectiveness as a comic vary.

Similarly, the comedian Charlie Chester admitted that, as a comedian, Robey \"still didn't make me laugh,\" although he described him as \"a legend\" whose Prime Minister of Mirth character used a beautiful make-up design.Cotes, p. 167. Robey's biographer Peter Cotes disagreed with these assessments, praising the comedian's \"droll like humour\" and comparing it in greatness to Chaplin's miming and Grock's clowning.Cotes, p. 4. Cotes wrote: \"His Mayor, Professor of Music, Saracen, Dame Trot, Queen of Hearts, District Nurse, Pro's Landlady, and of course his immortal Prime Minister, were all absurdities: rich, outsize in prim and pride, gloriously disapproving bureaucratic petty officialdom at its worst, best and funniest.\"Cotes, p. 179."]}, {"page": "Grand Order of Water Rats", "response": ["* 1947 Robb Wilton"]}, {"page": "Bert Lee", "response": ["In 1915, music publisher David Day, of Francis, Day and Hunter, introduced Lee to R.
