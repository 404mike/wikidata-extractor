Up to now we have focused very much on the ministry of Anglican clergy, but in Cornwall especially, almost all communities have an active Methodist presence, and we felt it was time to show some of the ways in which Free church ministers are involved in the busy lives of their communities.\" The third series was filmed over the preceding six months before the first episode aired, with more episodes completed while the series aired.
