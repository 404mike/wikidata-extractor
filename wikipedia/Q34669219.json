Luton then played Crewe Alexandra at home, who took the lead in the 35th minute through Jordan Bowery before Hylton equalised four minutes later with his 22nd goal of the season. Elliot Lee scored with a curling shot in first-half stoppage time, and Mpanzu finished the scoring with a 30-yard shot into the top corner early into the second half, meaning the match ended in a 3\u20131 win for Luton. Luton were promoted to League One after a 10-year absence following a 1\u20131 draw away to Carlisle United.

Though the budget was reduced he aimed to have a smaller and more competitive squad. His first summer signing was midfielder Scott Burgess, released from Bury despite an impressive loan spell at York City; the 21-year-old had previously played on loan at Macclesfield Town in Askey's National League title winning season. He next signed Adam Crookes, a 21-year-old defender who had been released by Nottingham Forest despite impressing whilst on loan at Vale in the second half of the 2018\u201319 season. He then signed 25-year-old Kieran Kennedy, \"a footballing centre-half\" who turned down a new deal at Wrexham in order to return to the English Football League. Big target man striker Richie Bennett then joined, having been let go by Carlisle United. The signings of 27-year-old former Blackpool striker Mark Cullen and 25-year-old former youth-team midfielder Ryan Lloyd were confirmed on 26 June. On 8 July, winger David Amoo arrived on a one-year deal after rejecting a new contract with Cambridge United; this was the first signing to meet Askey's priorities of bringing in a winger, a right-back and a backup goalkeeper. Askey also evaluated five trialists in pre-season friendlies: 19-year-old Bradford (Park Avenue) midfielder Alex Hurst, former Darlington goalkeeper Jonny Maddison, former Millwall and Reading right-back Shaun Cummings, former Yeovil Town winger Rhys Browne and former Coventry City striker Kwame Thomas. Cummings left without a contract as Askey instead again signed another of his former Macclesfield Town players, 23-year-old Callum Evans, who \u2013 like Lloyd \u2013 had been released by Macclesfield boss Sol Campbell. Bookmakers predicted a mid-table finish for the club. The club kit was reverted to Erre\u00e0 manufacturers and the shirt sponsors were revealed as Synectics Solutions, the company owned by chairpersons Carol and Kevin Shanahan. The black and gold away kit was launched in tribute to the protestors who helped to oust Smurthwaite. As pre-season drew to a close the club took a week long trip to Scotland. Trialist winger Rhys Browne, yet another former Macclesfield player, became the ninth summer signing on the day of the club's final pre-season friendly. Signing number ten was the new back-up goalkeeper, 24-year-old Jonny Maddison, who had impressed on trial. A third of the five trialists was also signed, though Alex Hurst was immediately loaned back to Bradford (Park Avenue) in order to gain match experience.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||21||align=\"left\"| Richie Bennett", "|3||FW||||21||Richie Bennett||6||0||0||1||7", "|21||||FW||Richie Bennett||1||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||2||0", "| 1 July 2019 || CF ||  || Richie Bennett || Carlisle United || Free transfer || ", "| 12 March 2020 || CF ||  || Richie Bennett || Stockport County || Undisclosed || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2019 || CF ||  || Richie Bennett ||  Port Vale || Released || "]}]}}
