She was married to the painter Ben Nicholson, and was thus the daughter-in-law of the painter William Nicholson and his wife, the painter Mabel Pryde. She was the mother of the painter Kate Nicholson.\nWinifred Nicholson was a colourist who developed a personal impressionistic style, concentrating on domestic still life objects and landscapes.
