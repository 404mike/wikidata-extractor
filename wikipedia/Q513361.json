Rippon presented radio and television news programmes in South West England before moving to BBC One's Nine O'Clock News, becoming a regular presenter in 1975. She was the first female journalist permanently to present the BBC national television news, and the second female news presenter on British television after Barbara Mandell on Independent Television News (ITN) in 1955.\nRippon appeared on a Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1976, presented the first two series of Top Gear and also presented Come Dancing. She hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in 1977. She was a presenter on, and co-founder of, breakfast television franchisee TV-am. In the 1990s, she moved to radio, presenting daily news programmes for LBC Newstalk between 1990 and 1994, and appeared on Channel 4's The Big Breakfast as a stand-in newsreader.

This allowed for another kind of sketch: the staged historical drama, which usually parodied genuine historical television plays or films (such as Stalag 17, Antony and Cleopatra, or Napoleon and Josephine). Wise's character would write a play, complete with cheap props, shaky scenery and appallingly clumsy writing (\"the play what I wrote\" became a catchphrase), which would then be acted out by Morecambe, Wise and the show's guest star. Guests who participated included many big names of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Dame Flora Robson, Penelope Keith, Laurence Olivier, Sir John Mills, Vanessa Redgrave, Eric Porter, Peter Cushing (who in a running gag would keep turning up to complain that he had not been paid for an earlier appearance) and Frank Finlay\u2014as well as Glenda Jackson (as Cleopatra: \"All men are fools. And what makes them so is having beauty like what I have got...\"). Jackson had not previously been known as a comedian and this appearance led to her Oscar-winning role in A Touch of Class. Morecambe and Wise would often pretend not to have heard of their guest, or would appear to confuse them with someone else (former UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson returned the favour, when appearing as a guest at the duo's flat, by referring to Morecambe as \"Mor-e-cam-by\"). Also noteworthy was the occasion when the respected BBC newsreader Angela Rippon was induced to show her legs in a dance number (she had trained as a ballet dancer before she became a journalist and TV presenter). Braben later said that a large amount of the duo's humour was based on irreverence. A running gag in a number of shows was a short sequence showing a well-known artist in close-up saying \"I appeared in an Ernie Wise play, and look what happened to me!\". The camera would then pull back and show the artist doing some low-status job such as newspaper seller (Ian Carmichael), Underground guard (Fenella Fielding), dustman (Eric Porter), bus conductor (Andr\u00e9 Previn), or some other ill-paid employment. However, celebrities felt they had received the highest accolade in showbusiness by being invited to appear in \"an Ernest Wide play\" as Ernie once mispronounced it during a show's introduction involving \"Vanilla\" (Vanessa) Redgrave."]}, {"page": "Peter and the Wolf", "response": ["| Angela Rippon"]}, {"page": "BBC Parliament", "response": ["On 5 June to mark both the 41st anniversary of the 1975 EEC Referendum in the run-up to the 2016 EU Referendum the channel broadcast a night of current and archive programmes under the banner of \"75: Not Out.\" The opening programme (of the same name) was presented by Angela Rippon and featured the \"1975 Oxford Union Debate\" in two parts, a 1975 Panorama EEC debate which was presented by a young David Dimbleby, BBC news clips, the original 1975 EEC Referendum party political broadcasts and the surviving results programme."]}, {"page": "Come Dancing", "response": ["The many presenters over the years included Peter West, McDonald Hobley, Charles Nove, Terry Wogan, Brian Johnston, Angela Rippon, Michael Aspel, Noel Edmonds, David Jacobs, Judith Chalmers, Pete Murray and Rosemarie Ford.

Esther Rantzen had originally been one of the station's 'star' line up of presenter/shareholders, but pulled out in 1981 after the birth of her third child; she and the company agreed that the early-morning starts would present a problem in her raising her child.

When the franchise was announced in December 1980, Angela Rippon's contract with the BBC was about to expire, and was not renewed as a result of her new employment. This left her seeking freelance work before TV-am went on air. Anna Ford was dismissed by ITN, which had been part of another consortium bidding for the breakfast contract. ITN had presented Ford as their female programme anchor as part of their bid, unaware that she was planning to defect to TV-am. ITN heavily criticised her disloyalty and said that her dishonesty had made their bid seem 'ridiculous' to the IBA.Leapman, Michael. Treachery: The Power Struggle at TV-am. Unwin Hyman 1984.  ITN replaced Ford with Selina Scott, who herself landed a double blow to ITN when she defected to the BBC to present Breakfast Time towards the end of 1982. Michael Parkinson did remain with the BBC, who hoped to persuade him to stay as they had with Rantzen, but he finally left the corporation in 1982. A challenge for all the 'famous five' came before the station launch, when in an administration error, the contracts for the five presenters were sent to the wrong individuals, which led Angela Rippon to discover she was being paid \u00a360,000 per year, considerably less than Anna Ford who was being paid \u00a3145,000.

After only two editions on air, Ford was struck with flu and Michael Parkinson stepped in to cover for her. The ratings slide was halted for the first time since the launch and even edged slightly up in the second week of the new team. As Parkinson was hosting the weekend show, sports reporter Nick Owen stepped in for Parkinson on Fridays and Mondays. Rippon was castigated by viewers and the media for her blatant hostility to Owen on air. When he made an error in a link, Rippon stated \"You see, it's not as easy as you think.\" When Ford was fit to return to work, Peter Jay asked her to step aside as the combination of Parkinson, Rippon and Owen was worth continuing to help the ratings. Ford refused, stating that if she stepped down, it would be too easy for the media to pin the disastrous start to the station on her. Rippon's behaviour and Ford's refusal to step aside caused great anger with the TV-am board and director Jonathan Aitken believed Jay incompetent for not removing them both.", "A boardroom coup ensued on 18 March 1983, when Peter Jay stepped aside allowing Jonathan Aitken to become chief executive of the station, after mounting pressure from investors who had demanded changes.Move to oust Jay at ailing TV-am.
