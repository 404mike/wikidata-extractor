For these projects, approximately 7,000 key-frames (approximately every 5th PAL video frame) were fully colorized by hand, without the use of masks, layers, or the segmentation method. These were then utilized by SVS Resources to interpolate the color across the intervening surrounding frames using a part computerized/part manual process."]}, {"page": "John Levene", "response": ["In September 2017, he joined other Doctor Who stars, including showrunner Steven Moffat, in recording audio contributions for the YouTube anniversary video of mutimedia artist Stuart Humphryes."]}, {"page": "The Daleks' Master Plan", "response": ["* Episode 1 (\"The Nightmare Begins\") \u2013 In late 1991, a mute copy of the pre-filmed inserts for the story was discovered in a film can in the BBC archive.
