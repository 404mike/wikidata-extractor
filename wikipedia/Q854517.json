Jones was born at Newland, Gloucestershire and brought up in Monmouth, leaving to make a sizeable fortune as a London merchant engaged in the cloth trade with the continent. The motivations for his bequest appear partly philanthropic and partly evangelical; the county of Monmouthshire in the early 17th century had a significant Catholic presence and the local historian Keith Kissack noted, \"the priority given to the preacher illustrates [Jones's] concern to convert an area in the Marches which was still, when the school opened in 1614, strongly recusant\". The order for the establishment of the school was made, retrospectively by James I in 1616 and decreed \"for ever in the town of Monmouth, one almshouse and one free grammar school\".", "The Monmouthshire antiquarian Charles Heath described the traditional, and almost certainly inaccurate, story of the school's foundation in his Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of the Town of Monmouth, published in 1804. Heath records that William Jones, now established as a successful and wealthy merchant, returned to his home town of Newland disguised as a beggar. Receiving a hostile reception, he travelled to Monmouth, where he was more warmly received and where, as a consequence, he funded the construction of the school and associated almshouses. The story is taken from an earlier oral tradition, also recorded in Archdeacon Coxe's An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire, published three years before. In 1899, the Rev. W. M. Warlow published his History of the Charities of William Jones at Monmouth and Newland. His fellow cleric and master, the Rev. K. M. Pitt wrote a more focused account, Monmouth School in the 1860s.
