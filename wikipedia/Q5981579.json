Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: The Thing from Another World, which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\"; and It Came From Outer Space, where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\". Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to \"concentrate on showing the 'effects' of the shark rather than the shark itself\". Scholars such as Thomas Schatz have described how Jaws melds various genres while essentially being an action film and a thriller. Most is taken from horror, with the core of a nature-based monster movie while adding elements of a slasher film. The second half is both a buddy film in the interaction between the crew of the Orca, and a supernatural horror based on the shark's depiction of a nearly Satanic menace. In:  Ian Freer describes Jaws as an aquatic monster movie, citing the influence of earlier monster films such as King Kong and Godzilla. Charles Derry, in 1977, also compared Jaws to Godzilla; and Spielberg cited Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956) as a formative influence growing up, due to the \"masterful\" way in which \"it made you believe it was really happening.\""]}, {"page": "Thunderbirds (2004 film)", "response": ["The movie received negative reviews. Those familiar with the series tended to be more negative. Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph called it \"a quite cretinous travesty of the original series\", saying that the film lacks the TV series's romantic approach to technology (particularly mentioning its rushed version of the countdown to the Thunderbirds takeoff) and suffers from thin plotting and dialogue. He also regarded the entire trend of making films based on decades-old TV series as good-intentioned but misguided, arguing, \"Those programmes can be seen on terrestrial and cable TV. They're available on DVD. They don't need reviving and updating.\" The Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli similarly called the film a \"rather breathtakingly misconceived attempt to revisit a vintage TV show that did not under any circumstances need to be revisited\". She found the central character Alan \"whiny and uninteresting\", the script poor, the plot contrived and unsatisfying, and the acting wooden, though she noted that her three children enjoyed it much more than she did. She gave it a C-. Ian Freer, writing for Empire, assessed that the film fails to either evoke nostalgia in the generation which watched Thunderbirds as children or provide snappy entertainment for the current generation of children. Like Sandhu, he felt the countdown sequence was so rushed that there is no sense of occasion to a Thunderbird taking to the sky. He also said that the child leads lack spirit and chemistry, and the adult characters suffer from excessive exposition and flat characterization. While he did praise Sophia Myles's performance and the vehicle designs, he considered the film an overall failure and gave it two out of five stars. On the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 19% \"rotten\" rating based on 106 reviews.

Richard Roeper from the Chicago Sun-Times praised the actress for \"livening up the proceedings\" as the strait-laced Ms. Granada and Ian Freer of the Empire magazine felt that she did the \"kids' film acting to the hilt\". Chopra's first film of 2021 was Ramin Bahrani's The White Tiger, an adaptation of Aravind Adiga's satirical novel of the same name. She portrayed the role of Pinky Madam alongside Adarsh Gourav and Rajkummar Rao, and also executive produced this Netflix production. Critical reviews towards the film and her performance were positive.

People actually said, 'No, we're going to respect Steven's vision.'\" Prior to release, moviegoers on the Internet scrutinized numerous photos and the film's promotional Lego sets in hope of understanding plot details. Spielberg biographer Ian Freer wrote, \"What Indy IV is actually about has been the great cultural guessing game of 2007/08. Yet, it has to be said, there is something refreshing about being ten weeks away from a giant blockbuster and knowing next to nothing about it.\" To distract investigative fans from the film's title during filming, five fake titles were registered with the Motion Picture Association of America; The City of Gods, The Destroyer of Worlds, The Fourth Corner of the Earth, The Lost City of Gold and The Quest for the Covenant.

Set in a group home for troubled teenagers, the film featured her as Grace, the emotionally distressed supervisor of the institution. To prepare, Larson interacted with staff in a children's home and watched online interviews of people with similar jobs. The film had a production budget of under $1\u00a0million, and she was pleased with its intimate and collaborative work environment. Larson's performance was acclaimed by critics. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times found her \"terrific\" and \"completely persuasive\", and Ian Freer of Empire stated that she \"builds into a whirling dervish of a performance, making Grace strong but scarred, damaged but compassionate\". Jenny McCartney of The Daily Telegraph predicted that it would \"[mark] her out for a stellar career\".

She then portrayed Maggie Esmerelda, a con artist posing as a fortune teller, in American Horror Story: Freak Show.

She admitted to having never read the comics, and therefore felt responsible to educate herself about Spider-Man: \"My experience was with the Sam Raimi movies\u00a0...

Yohana Desta of Vanity Fair called the film \"an apocalyptic identity crisis come to life\" and \"an unruly Frankenstein's monster with shoddy stitchwork.\" Desta noted that despite the film's nonsensical/non-existent plot, the visual effects remain impressive. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic criticized the film for attempting to connect the Transformers to Stonehenge and World War II, and called it the worst retelling of Arthurian legend of the year, even worse than Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.
