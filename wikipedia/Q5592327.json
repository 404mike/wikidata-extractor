This was further extended for another month on 12 March. On 16 January, England international Gary Cahill completed a move to Chelsea with the fee believed to be around \u00a37million. Bolton had agreed a fee with Chelsea for the player shortly before the turn of the year but the transfer had been delayed due to the player failing to agree personal terms with the London club. Bolton replaced Cahill with another defender later in the month when they signed United States international Tim Ream from the New York Red Bulls. Ream had been on trial with both Bolton and West Bromwich Albion in late 2011 and signed on a three-and-a-half year deal, for an undisclosed fee, believed to be \u00a32.5 million. On transfer deadline day, 31 January, Bolton secured the loan signing of Japanese under-19 international Ryo Miyaichi from Arsenal for the rest of the season and England under-21 international Marvin Sordell from Watford for a figure believed to be between \u00a33\u20134 million. On the same day they loaned reserve team midfield player Graeme MacGregor to Hamilton Academical until the end of the season. On 24 February, Bolton loaned out two players, reserve team captain Mark Connolly to Macclesfield and midfielder Sean Davis, who had made only four first team appearances following two major injures since joining the club in 2009, to Bristol City, both on one month deals. At the beginning of March, Bolton loaned veteran defender Paul Robinson to Leeds United, also on a month loan. At the end of the initial month, the loan was extended until the end of the season. Later in the month Tope Obadeyi was loaned to Rochdale for a second time having been there for a period two seasons previously.", "|  Graeme MacGregor"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Hamilton Academical F.C. season", "response": ["||| MF|| Graeme MacGregor", "| Graeme MacGregor"]}, {"page": "1993 in Scotland", "response": ["*14 June \u2013 Graeme MacGregor, footballer"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 St Mirren F.C. season", "response": ["| 15|||| MF||Graeme MacGregor", "|  Graeme MacGregor", "| Graeme MacGregor "]}, {"page": "Graeme McGregor", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graeme MacGregor"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 East Stirlingshire F.C. season", "response": ["|||MF||Graeme MacGregor", "|  Graeme MacGregor"]}]}}
