The team finally achieved promotion from the division in 1996\u201397 as runners-up. This promotion was built on a strong defence, of which Gannon and fellow centre-back Sean Connelly were a major part.

Phelan moved on shortly afterwards, taking up a role at Manchester United's Centre of Excellence. Following Steve McClaren's departure to Middlesbrough in the summer of 2001, Phelan was promoted to first-team coach. He was appointed assistant manager of United on 3 September 2008, replacing Carlos Queiroz who had left to manage the Portugal national football team. For many years, Phelan conducted interviews for BBC programmes such as Match of the Day, due to United manager Alex Ferguson refusing to speak with the BBC following corruption allegations made in 2004 by the BBC's Panorama programme towards one of Ferguson's sons, football agent Jason Ferguson. Ferguson finally agreed to BBC interviews once more in August 2011. In January 2010, Phelan was linked with a return to his first club Burnley as manager following the departure of Owen Coyle to Bolton Wanderers. He was Ferguson's right-hand man for three Premier League titles, a FIFA Club World Cup, two League Cups, and two runs to the final of the UEFA Champions League.

Kuqi made his debut for the club in a 1\u20131 draw against Tranmere Rovers on 3 February 2001. Regarded by many as the saviour of County's 2000\u201301 season as he impressed with his speed and strength, he went on to score six goals in eighteen games to help County retain their division one status. Kuqi is still the club's second most internationally capped player. However, under player-manager Carlton Palmer, after he succeeded Andy Kilner as manager, Kuqi was used less frequently. His good performances led him being linked with his future club Blackburn. Kuqi was on the verge of joining Blackburn worth about a \u00a31.2 million fee, but the move broke down and he accused Palmer of threatening him to be sacked for being injured Palmer was responsible for pressuring Graeme Souness for Kuqi not joining the club. Kuqi still maintains his accusations towards Palmer, claiming his management is 'clueless' and feels the club made a mistake having Palmer as manager. Kuqi joined Blackburn Rovers four years later."]}, {"page": "Kilner", "response": ["* Andy Kilner (born 1966), former English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Jon Daly (footballer)", "response": ["Born in Dublin, Ireland, Daly started his career at Irish amateur side Cherry Orchard, before signing for Stockport County in May 1998.
