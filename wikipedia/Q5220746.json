Stimson signed goalkeeper Danny Potter and stated that Potter would be the club's first choice goalkeeper. Julian was subsequently an unused substitute for Stevenage's first two games of the season. However, after Potter was sent-off in Stevenage's home game against Crawley Town, Julian made his first appearance of the season, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute in a 3\u20132 defeat. Julian remained first choice goalkeeper from then onwards, making 53 appearances for the club during the 2006\u201307 season as Stevenage finished eighth in the Conference National. Eight of Julian's appearances during the season came in the club's successful FA Trophy campaign, keeping four clean sheets in the process. He also made a number vital saves in the club's semi-final second leg against Grays Athletic, which Stevenage went on to win by a 3\u20131 aggregate scoreline. Julian started in the Final, which Stevenage won 3\u20132 against Kidderminster Harriers at Wembley Stadium in front of a crowd of 53,262. The win meant that Julian was part of the first team to win a competitive final at the new stadium."]}, {"page": "Steven Drench", "response": ["After being released by Morecambe in June 2008, he signed for Southport permanently in July. However, he was allowed to leave the club on a free transfer and had a one-week trial with Conference team Stevenage Borough due to Drench's desire to remain full-time after the club reverted to part-time status following the departure of manager Gary Brabin to Cambridge United.  Drench was reunited with Brabin after signing for Cambridge on a six-month loan on 21 August to provide cover for Danny Potter.

The first three were against teams battling relegation and the Gulls took full advantage, grabbing maximum points against struggling Stockport, Barnet and Burton Albion.  These matches saw Paul Buckle begin to experiment with his squad selection with second choice keeper Danny Potter being brought in to give Scott Bevan a well-deserved break and left back Lathaniel Rowe-Turner deputising for the ever-present Kevin Nicholson.  Both players rewarded the manager's faith with Potter keeping clean sheets in his first three games and Rowe-Turner scoring on his first league start of the season against Barnet.
