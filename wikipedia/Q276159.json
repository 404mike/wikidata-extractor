In 1997, the term \"Spice Boys\" emerged in the British media as a term coined to characterise the \"pop star\" antics and lifestyles off the pitch of a group of Liverpool F.C. footballers that includes Jamie Redknapp, David James, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and Jason McAteer. The label has stuck with these footballers ever since, with John Scales, one of the so-called Spice Boys, admitting in 2015 that, \"We're the Spice Boys and it's something we have to accept because it will never change.\" In the Philippines, the \"Spice Boys\" tag was given to a group of young Congressmen of the House of Representatives who initiated the impeachment of President Joseph Estrada in 2001. The Australian/British string quartet Bond were dubbed by the international press as the \"Spice Girls of classical music\" during their launch in 2000 due to their \"sexy\" image and classical crossover music that incorporated elements of pop and dance music. A spokeswoman for the quartet said in response to the comparisons, \"In fact, they are much better looking than the Spice Girls. But we don't welcome comparisons. The Bond girls are proper musicians; they have paid their dues.\" The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) doubles team of Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova, two-time Grand Slam and two-time WTA Finals Doubles champions, dubbed themselves the \"Spice Girls of tennis\" in 1999. Hingis and Kournikova, along with fellow WTA players Venus and Serena Williams, were also labelled the \"Spice Girls of tennis\", then later the \"Spite Girls\", by the media in the late 1990s due to their youthfulness, popularity and brashness."]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 FA Premier League", "response": ["| John Scales"]}, {"page": "Steve Nicol", "response": ["He remained a regular player for Liverpool until the start of the 1994\u201395 season, when he was forced onto the sidelines with the arrival of new defenders Phil Babb and John Scales.
