He was the son of Dr. Francis William Crick and educated at Bedford Modern School and the Royal School of Mines. Between January 1881 and 1886, Crick was employed as Assistant Secretary to Sir Warington Smyth, Chairman of \"H.M. Commission to enquire into Accidents in Mines, etc.\". In the same year and in a voluntary capacity, Crick joined the Geological Department of the Natural History Museum, London.At the Natural History Museum Crick was commissioned to catalogue the fossil Cephalopoda (Belemnites and the Ammonites) and \u2018throwing his whole heart into the work left it one of the best arranged and indexed collections\u2019 at the Museum.  He was appointed a First Assistant of the Museum in 1904.In the course of his career Crick wrote sixty-seven papers that were published in various scientific journals including seven written in association with Arthur Humphreys Foord and one with Richard Bullen Newton who was also a first assistant at the Natural History Museum. His work included the description of seventy-four new species and the description of three new genera: Amphoreopsis, Styracoteuthis, and Belemnocamax.Crick was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1881, a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London in 1896 and a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1916.Crick died in Wimbledon on 18 October 1917 and was survived by his wife, Emily Harriett Crick, who herself died on 29 January 1919.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peloneustes", "response": ["Naturalist Richard Lydekker was informed of a plesiosaur skeleton in the British Museum of Natural History by geologist George Charles Crick, who worked there. The specimen, catalogued under NHMUK  R1253, had been discovered in the Oxford Clay Formation in Green End, Kempston, near Bedford. While Lydekker speculated that the skeleton was once complete, it was damaged during excavation. The limb girdles had been heavily fragmented when the specimen arrived at the museum, but a worker named Lingard in the Geology Department managed to restore much of them. In addition to the limb girdles, the specimen also consists of a partial mandible, teeth, multiple vertebrae (although none from the neck), and much of the limbs. Lydekker identified this specimen as an individual of Plesiosaurus philarchus and published a description of it in 1889. After studying this and other specimens in the Leeds Collection, he concluded that plesiosaurs with shortened necks and large heads could not be classified as species of Plesiosaurus, meaning that \"P.\" philarchus belonged to a different genus. He initially assigned it to Thaumatosaurus in 1888, but later decided that it was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, which he named Peloneustes in his 1889 publication. The name Peloneustes comes from the Greek words , meaning \"mud\" or \"clay\", in reference to the Oxford Clay Formation, and , meaning \"swimmer\". Seeley, however, lumped Peloneustes into Pliosaurus in 1892, claiming that the two were insufficiently different to warrant separate genera. Seeley and Lydekker could not agree on which genus to classify P. philarchus in, representing part of a feud between the two scientists. However, Peloneustes has since become the accepted name."]}, {"page": "List of Old Bedford Modernians", "response": ["* George Charles Crick FGS FRGS FZS (1856\u20131917), geologist, authority on Cephalopoda, 1st Assistant at the Natural History Museum"]}, {"page": "Arthur Humphreys Foord", "response": ["Foord was given the responsibility of preparing the Catalogue of the Fossil Cephalopoda in the British Museum (Natural History) in 1886, seeing the first two volumes published in 1888 and 1891, and a third with George Charles Crick published in 1897. As part of this work, he studied type material in Munich and Brussels. He also published a number of papers and reviews on nautiloids in the Geological Magazine at this time.
