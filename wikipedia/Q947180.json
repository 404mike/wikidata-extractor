Tong has also worked as a record producer and is regarded as the \"global ambassador for electronic music.\"The phrase \"It's all gone Pete Tong\", where the name is used as rhyming slang for \"a bit wrong\", was reputedly first coined by Paul Oakenfold in late 1987 in an article about acid house called \"Bermondsey Goes Balearic\" for Terry Farley and Pete Heller's Boys Own fanzine. It's All Gone Pete Tong is also the title of a 2004 film which portrays a fictional DJ's experiences as he realizes he is becoming deaf. Tong appears briefly in the film. It is also the name Tong has adopted for his club night at the nightclub Pacha in Ibiza and his nightly radio programme in the United States on iHeartRadio's \"Evolution\" EDM format platform.In 2008, Tong was involved with organizing the International Music Summit in Ibiza, an event that has become an annual fixture (the 2016 Summit was held during 25\u201327 May).

The rise of rave culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ Pete Tong amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the Essential Mix where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot.

It is one of very few Radio 1 shows which is not broadcast live.", "The Essential Mix is a weekly radio show broadcast on BBC Radio 1 and features many styles of electronic dance music. It was originally the brainchild of Eddie Gordon, the producer of the show from the first broadcast in 1993 to 2001. In 1993, after months of receiving weekly mix shows on tape-cassette, featuring New York DJs Tony Humphries WRKS 98.7 Kiss FM and Frankie Knuckles WQHT HOT 97 FM, and recorded and mailed religiously by U.S. Billboards Dance Editor Brian Chin, Eddie advised BBC Radio 1 that a weekly dance-mix show with DJs of different genres of music would offer more variety and the chance for the ever-burgeoning UK dance music scene to flourish with both notable and upcoming DJs. Eddie further encouraged the DJs he scheduled to flex their musical knowledge; a high number of listeners were recording the show on cassette to listen to later, so a straight out \"4 to the floor\" mix was not necessarily required, allowing the DJs to include more eclectic music or offer something different from their normal selections. DJ Paul Oakenfold particularly grasped the concept, and after sitting with Eddie to blueprint his December 1994 Essential Mix, he produced the now world-famous Goa Mix, which won a Silver Award in the Specialist Music Programme category at the 1998 Sony Radio Awards and in 2000 was voted the Best Ever Essential Mix by the BBC Radio 1 listeners. Then DJ David Holmes in June 1997 created another two legendary hours in the history of the Essential Mix; his set, a surprising journey from Nancy Wilson to Jimi Hendrix, redefined the DJ as a collector of musical history. In May 1998, DJ Ashley Beedle, known for his house music style, completed a two-hour reggae mix to reveal his extensive knowledge of that genre of music and it is blogged as the best reggae mix ever broadcast (see link Best Foot Forward). The show has been hosted since its inception in 1993 by DJ Pete Tong, who was also the first performer.", "Another Eddie Gordon initiative was to take the show on the road with live broadcasts from clubs or festivals, particularly during the summer months (Northern Hemisphere) and at New Year's Eve. The live broadcasts started from within the UK and soon broadened out as live from Ibiza, North America, Australia, South Africa, Germany, Hawaii and other destinations in Europe including Rome in Italy. One special broadcast was the BBC Radio 1 - One World millennium celebration starting with DJ Carl Cox from Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, before heading to Cape Town, South Africa with DJ Danny Rampling prior to broadcasting DJ Dave Pearce from Glasgow, Scotland, DJ Pete Tong from Liverpool, UK then DJ Junior Vasquez from New York, United States before closing with DJ Carl Cox, who had flown backwards across the dateline to complete a DJ world first with two millennium gigs by broadcasting from Honolulu, Hawaii.", "The forerunner to this mammoth New Year's Eve Essential Mix was the transatlantic three-cities broadcast on the New Year's Eve of 1997 into 1998, with simultaneous broadcasts from three clubs directly to each dance floor with DJ Pete Tong at the Ministry Of Sound, London. DJ Todd Terry at the Nynex Arena in Manchester, UK, and finishing with DJ Eddie Baez at the Tunnel venue in Manhattan, New York, USA. It was produced by Eddie Gordon, who originated the idea of linking the three venues via ISDN broadcast.", "At the end of each year, a shortlist of the most popular Essential Mixes from that year is drawn up by the BBC. Listeners are invited to vote for their favourite shortlisted mix in a poll on the Essential Mix website around two weeks before the final show of the year. The mix with the majority of the votes is given the title of \"Essential Mix of the Year\" and is replayed in the final show of the year. The exception for the proper nomination of the Essential Mix of the Year award was in 2007, when voting and competitions were suspended on Radio 1 until further notice, due to failures in various BBC competition voting systems. So for that year, the Essential Mix of the Year (High Contrast) was chosen by Pete Tong and the Radio 1 Essential Mix team.", "*1993-10-30: First show, Pete Tong studio session.", "*1996-07-28: First live Ibiza show \u2013 Danny Rampling, Sasha, Pete Tong.", "*1998-05-02: Pete Tong, Sasha and Paul Oakenfold at first Creamfields."]}]}}
