Demands for such an inquiry emerged later, and became more insistent. On 2 September 2009, former MEP Michael McGowan demanded that the UK government call for an urgent, independent inquiry led by the UN to find out the truth about Pan Am flight 103. \"We owe it to the families of the victims of Lockerbie and the international community to identify those responsible,\" McGowan said. Two online petitions were started: one calling for a UK public inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing; the other a UN inquiry into the murder of UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. In September 2009, a third petition which was addressed to the President of the United Nations General Assembly demanded that the UN should \"institute a full public inquiry\" into the Lockerbie disaster. On 3 October 2009, Malta was asked to table a UN resolution supporting the petition, which was signed by 20 people including the families of the Lockerbie victims, authors, journalists, professors, politicians and parliamentarians, as well as Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The signatories considered that a UN inquiry could help remove \"many of the deep misgivings which persist in lingering over this tragedy\" and could also eliminate Malta from this terrorist act. Malta was brought into the case because the prosecution argued that the two accused Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, had placed the bomb on an Air Malta aircraft before it was transferred at Frankfurt airport to a feeder flight destined for London's Heathrow airport, from which Pan Am Flight 103 departed. The Maltese government responded saying that the demand for a UN inquiry was \"an interesting development that would be deeply considered, although there were complex issues surrounding the event.\""]}, {"page": "Michael McGowan", "response": ["Michael McGowan may refer to:", "* Michael McGowan (footballer) (born 1985), association football player", "* Michael McGowan (politician) (born 1940), British Labour Member of the European Parliament, 1984\u20131999", "* Michael McGowan (director) (born 1966), film director and screenwriter"]}, {"page": "Leeds (European Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Michael McGowan"]}]}}
