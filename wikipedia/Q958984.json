ZANU leader Robert Mugabe and ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo insisted on the redistribution of land\u2014by compulsory seizure, without compensation\u2014as a precondition to a negotiated peace settlement. This was reflective of prevailing attitudes in their guerrilla armies, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) respectively, and rural support bases, which had high expectations of the redistribution of land. The British government, which mediated the talks, proposed a constitutional clause underscoring property ownership as an inalienable right to prevent a mass exodus of white farmers and the economic collapse of the country. This was enshrined in Section 16 of the Zimbabwean Constitution, 1980. To secure Mugabe and Nkomo's support for the constitutional agreement, Lord Carrington announced that the United Kingdom would be prepared to assist land resettlement with technical assistance and financial aid. The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations, Sir Shridath Ramphal, also received assurances from the American ambassador in London, Kingman Brewster, that the United States would likewise contribute capital for \"a substantial amount for a process of land redistribution and they would undertake to encourage the British government to give similar assurances\"."]}, {"page": "Order of New Zealand", "response": ["| 1 || Sir Shridath Ramphal  || 60px || 6 February 1990 ||  || Former Commonwealth Secretary-General"]}, {"page": "List of Eastern Caribbean people", "response": ["*Sir Shridath Ramphal"]}, {"page": "Earth Charter", "response": ["One of the members of the Earth Charter Commission and Steering Committee was Steven Clark Rockefeller, who, among other things is professor emeritus of Religion at Middlebury College and an advisory trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
