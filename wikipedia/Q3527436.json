His international career was restricted to the 1913\u201314 tour of South Africa, which was the last Test match tour before the First World War. After receiving a commission in the West Yorkshire Regiment, Booth became Second Lieutenant Major Booth, and died just under a year later when he went over the top on the trenches on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Somme offensive. After his death his sister would light a candle in his room every night in the hope that he would return.", "link_mentions": {}}}
