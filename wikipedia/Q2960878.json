Wales had been unofficially crowned the World's best team after a Triple Crown winning season in 1905 and a win over the All Blacks in the 'Game of the Century'. The Glamorgan team that had run the South Africans close earlier in the tour had contained twelve internationals, and the Welsh were keen for revenge. Despite this, Roos was a popular figure in Wales, and with his deep impressive voiceBillot (1974), pg 12. and \"pronounced Dutch accent\",Parry-Jones (1999), pg 187. he had spoken at church meetings throughout the tour; and Roos' cordial manner had paid dividends earlier in the tour after the game against Newport. South Africa beat Newport by a goal and a try to nil, and after the game the two team captains sat down at the Westgate Hotel for a post-match dinner.Billot (1974), pg 21. Roos asked Charlie Pritchard, the Newport skipper, how the Newport forwards, who were lighter than the South Africans, had stolen the ball away so many times in the scrums. The tactic, which the Welsh team had used to counter the famous New Zealand scrum, was discussed with great openness between Pritchard and Roos, and when the South Africans left the next day Roos shook Pritchard's hand at the train station and thanked him.Billot (1974), pg 27.

He joined the club in 1902 as a threequarter and continued to represent the club until 1908.

Again under the captaincy of Pritchard, Griffiths was put into the fullback position by his club. Griffiths did not have a good game; in the first half Canterbury wing Eric Harper easily beat Griffiths to score a try.Thomas (1979), pg 37. The tourists furthered their lead with a penalty goal, before Griffiths gave Newport hope with a penalty goal of his own, but despite heroic efforts by scrum-half Tommy Vile, the tourists won the game.

The Wales team first face England, who were demolished 25\u20130 by a vastly superior and more skilful Welsh team.Griffiths (1987), 4:13. The second game was against Scotland, which saw Rees' position as an amateur player queried by some sections of the Scottish sporting establishment.Smith (1980), pg 124. Wales won through two Willie Llewellyn tries, but this was to be Rees' final international. The final game of the tournament was a Triple Crown decider between Wales and Ireland, both having beaten Scotland and England. The match was played at Swansea's home ground, St. Helen's, and Rees had been selected to play, paired as he had been for the last two matches with Rhys Gabe.Parry-Jones (1999), pg 124. On the morning of the match, Rees informed the WRU that he was ineligible to play, which would have opened the way for nominated reserve, and Swansea's captain, Frank Gordon to gain his first international cap. The WRU reacted harshly to this, and reinstated Nicholls as they believed that Rees was following club orders to give their captain an international cap. The St Helen's crowd booed Nicholls and even pelted him with mud and oranges during the team photo, reacting badly to what was a snub to their captain and their team. Despite the ill feeling to Nicholls, Wales still won the game, making Rees, again in his absence, a Triple Crown winner for a second time."]}, {"page": "Edwin Thomas Maynard", "response": ["Thomas was not selected for the 1905 Championship, but was part of the Newport team to face the Original All Blacks, on the All Blacks first overseas tour.

Like many successful players from the area, once Jones had been noticed as a rugby talent, he progressed to Neath RFC, the most notable club in the region. In the 1903-04 season, Neath made Jones the captain of the Neath senior XV. As captain of Neath, Jones was selected for his one and only international appearance, playing for Wales in the country's final game of the 1904 Home Nations Championship. Wales had already played England and Scotland, registering a draw and a win, meaning a win over Ireland would give Wales the possibility of winning the Championship. The Welsh selectors had brought in new capped players throughout the campaign and the final game was no exception. Jones was one of three players who were representing Wales for the first time during the Irish game and the tenth of the tournament. All three new caps were in the forward positions, and Jones was joined by Newport's Charlie Pritchard and Sid Bevan from Swansea. The game ended controversially, with the match referee blames for allowing Ireland a try from an illegal forward pass, and then denying Welsh wing Dick Jones a winning try.
