It was stated at the time that the loco would receive a spring green livery (known as \"Ailsa Green\" as it was standard livery at the time of his ownership) but it remained in plain white livery, untill removal of some of its ballast weights which has resulted in a red oxide lower half with a white upper.  The locomotive was originally built to work on the construction railway in the Channel Tunnel which accounts for the somewhat squat appearance, although the cab was extended upwards before its arrival on island.  This also results in limited visibility for the driver which has seen it fitted with closed circuit television cameras to aid vision.  However, this disability as well as the absence of a continuous train braking system (in this case vacuum brakes) and also a mechanically governed top speed of 25kmh (15.53mph) ensures that the locomotive is used largely on shunting and permanent way duties being unsuitable for passenger workings."]}, {"page": "Archibald David Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa", "response": ["#REDIRECT Archibald Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa"]}, {"page": "Archibald Kennedy", "response": ["Archibald Kennedy is the name of:", "* Archibald Kennedy, 11th Earl of Cassilis (died 1794)", "* Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa (1770\u20131846)", "* Archibald Kennedy, Earl of Cassilis (1794\u20131832)", "* Archibald Kennedy, 2nd Marquess of Ailsa (1816\u20131870)", "* Archibald Kennedy, 3rd Marquess of Ailsa (1847\u20131938)", "* Archibald Kennedy, 4th Marquess of Ailsa (1872\u20131943)", "* Archibald Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa (1925\u20131994)", "* Archibald Kennedy, 8th Marquess of Ailsa (1956\u20132015)"]}, {"page": "David Kennedy, 9th Marquess of Ailsa", "response": ["David Thomas Kennedy was born on 3 July 1958, the younger son of Archibald Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa.
