He was a correspondent for the Austrian newspaper Neue Freie Presse and from 1938, worked for the German Service of the BBC. During the war he wrote German-language British propaganda with other emigrants, like Bruno Adler.

Under the guise of literary entertainment, these German-language programs broadcast British propaganda to Germany, using established native-speaking writers in exile, such as Adler and Robert Lucas, and targeted the average German, who was growing weary of endless war. Listening carried severe penalties in Germany, imprisonment and even death, so the programs were short, between three and seven minutes. Characters had to be easily identifiable and they had little time to impress the thought of their target audience.Jennifer Taylor; Ian Wallace (Ed.), \"The 'Endsieg' as Ever-Receding Goal.
