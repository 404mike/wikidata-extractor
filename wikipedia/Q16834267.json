About 200 had gathered by daybreak, including a number of survivors of the attack on Ballymore-Eustace, when they were spotted by local military under the command of Lieutenant General Ralph Dundas, Commander of the Army of the Midlands, whose headquarters, Castle Martin, was located only three miles away.

A later legendFamily Romance; Or Episodes in the Domestic Annals of The Aristocracy. Bernard Burke (1853) suggests a canny deal between Dundas and the Earl of Hopetoun. \"John Dundas owned a property called Stang Hill Tower which was on the edge of the Earl of Hopetoun's estate. For many years the Earl tried to obtain the tower from John Dundas to add to his estate, but John Dundas refused all offers to let it go, despite the threat of law suits and even bribery. Finally on his death bed he told his son \"It is foolish forever to struggle against our rich and powerful neighbour. He will, sooner or later, have our little property; make the best terms with him you can\". Soon after John Dundas' death, an exchange highly advantageous to the Dundas' of Manour was effected. Stang Hill Tower being given to Lord Hopetoun and the estate of Aithrey which belonged to Lord Hopetoun being made over to Ralph Dundas\" (1675\u20131729). In 1747 John Dundas of Manour (1701\u20131780) (grandson of the John Dundas in the legend) rebuilt Airthrey House for himself and his family (including his son General Ralph Dundas, 1730\u20131814). His niece's husband, the writer John Ramsay of Ochtertyre (1736\u20131814), later described the house he built as \"a small snug house\" and says that \"conscious of his ignorance of country affairs\", John Dundas \"contented himself while there with making a kitchen-garden, and having a few acres in grass, without any corn, or adding to his father\u2019s small enclosures. He spent his time \u2026 among his books\"."]}, {"page": "Castlemartin House and Estate", "response": ["As noted, the house was commandeered during the 1798 rebellion as the headquarters of Ralph Dundas, and the interior was badly damaged."]}, {"page": "Governor of Duncannon Fort", "response": ["* 1802\u20131814: Ralph Dundas"]}, {"page": "Battle of Caesar's Camp", "response": ["The French army was in motion at dawn on 8 August. When the York's column reached Cantaing-sur-Escaut, he found the French gone. Though the other two columns soon halted, York kept going in the direction of Marquion. For the pursuit, York gathered up 2,000 British cavalry, including the Blues, Scots Greys, and Inniskilling Dragoons, three regiments of dragoon guards, and four regiments of light dragoons.Cust did not specify which light dragoon or dragoon guard regiments were present. Fortescue listed the light dragoon regiments with the army (Fortescue, p. 49), but not the dragoon guards. The brigade of Ralph Dundas included the 7th, 11th, 15th, and 16th Light Dragoons. When York arrived at Marquion, the French had set the buildings on fire and broken the bridge over the Agache in order to block Allied pursuit. York, his orderly, and Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron galloped through the burning village and soon spied a formation of cavalry. Believing it to be friendly, York rode up to the horsemen, announcing, \"Here are my Hanoverians!\" Recognizing that they were French, Langeron grabbed York's bridle and led him back to Marquion."]}, {"page": "William Sibbald", "response": ["*Dundas Street \u2013 either after General Ralph Dundas or after Admiral James Whitley Deans Dundas due to his then infamous recent recapture of Copenhagen, but also conveniently linking to the prominent Edinburgh Dundas family"]}]}}
