Between 1847 and 1853 he travelled over 40 000 miles through Central Asia and Siberia, much of the time together with his wife Lucy and son Alatau, who was born during their travels. He also painted and documented his travels in two books that are today regarded as travel classics. His and Lucy's son, Alatau Tamchiboulac Atkinson, born on 4 November 1848 in what is now Eastern Kazakhstan, was named after the famous Tamshybulak Spring in the town of Qapal at the foot of the Djungar Alatau mountains.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Thomas Witlam Atkinson (1799\u20131861)"]}, {"page": "Mihail Sadoveanu", "response": ["Also during that time, he retold and prefaced the journeys of Thomas Witlam Atkinson, an English architect and stonemason who spent years in Tartary (a book he titled Cuibul invaziilor, \"The Nest of Invasions\"). This was evidence of his growing interest in exotic subjects, which he later adapted to a series of novels, where the setting is \"Scythia\", seen as an ancestral area of culture connecting Central Asia with the European region of Dacia (partly coinciding with present-day Romania).C\u0103linescu, pp. 628-629 The home of mysterious Asiatic peoples, Sadoveanu's Scythia is notably the background to his novels Uvar and Nop\u021bile de S\u00e2nziene. The former shows its eponymous character, a Yakut, exposed to the scrutiny of a Russian officer. In the latter, titled after the ancestral celebration of S\u00e2nziene during the month of June, shows a French intellectual meeting a nomadic tribe of Moldavian Rom people, who, the reader learns, are actually the descendants of Pechenegs. C\u0103linescu notes that, in such writings, \"the intrigue is a pretext\", again serving to depict the vast wilderness confronted with the keen eye of foreign observers. He sees Nop\u021bile de S\u00e2nziene as \"the novel of millenarian immobility\", and its theme as one of mythological proportions. The narrative pretexts, including the S\u00e2nziene celebration and the Rom people's social atavism, connect Nop\u021bile... with another one of Sadoveanu's writings, 24 iunie (\"June 24\").Crohm\u0103lniceanu, pp. 203, 204, 242, 245-246, 247-248, 249"]}, {"page": "Thomas Atkinson", "response": ["*Thomas Witlam Atkinson (1799\u20131861), British architect"]}, {"page": "John Edgar Gregan", "response": ["Gregan was born at Dumfries on 18 December 1813.
