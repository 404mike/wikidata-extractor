She is best known for The Botticelli Trilogy, which is set in late fifteenth-century Florence.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Claudius", "response": ["The historical novel\u00a0Chariot of the Soul by\u00a0Linda Proud\u00a0features Claudius as host and mentor of the young Togidubnus, son of King Verica of the Atrebates, during his ten-year stay in Rome. When Togidubnus returns to Britain in advance of the Roman army, it is with a mission given to him by Claudius."]}, {"page": "Seneca the Younger", "response": ["Seneca is a character in Monteverdi's 1642 opera L'incoronazione di Poppea (The Coronation of Poppea), which is based on the pseudo-Senecan play, Octavia. In Nathaniel Lee's 1675 play Nero, Emperor of Rome, Seneca attempts to dissuade Nero from his egomaniacal plans, but is dragged off to prison, dying off-stage. He appears in Robert Bridges' verse drama Nero, the second part of which (published 1894) culminates in Seneca's death. Seneca appears in a fairly minor role in Henryk Sienkiewicz's 1896 novel Quo Vadis and was played by Nicholas Hannen in the 1951 film. In Robert Graves' 1934 book Claudius the God, the sequel novel to I, Claudius, Seneca is portrayed as an unbearable sycophant. He is shown as a flatterer who converts to Stoicism solely to appease Claudius' own ideology. The \"Pumpkinification\" (Apocolocyntosis) to Graves thus becomes an unbearable work of flattery to the loathsome Nero mocking a man that Seneca grovelled to for years. The historical novel Chariot of the Soul by Linda Proud features Seneca as tutor of the young Togidubnus, son of King Verica of the Atrebates, during his ten-year stay in Rome."]}, {"page": "Volterra", "response": ["* Linda Proud's A Tabernacle for the Sun (2005), the first volume of The Botticelli Trilogy, begins with the sack of Volterra in 1472.

The protagonist of the novel is Tommaso de' Maffei, half brother of one of the conspirators."]}, {"page": "Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus", "response": ["He is the first person protagonist in Linda Proud's novel, Chariot of the Soul, Linda Proud, Chariot of the Soul,  in which he describes his education in Rome, studying Stoicism with Seneca, and his return to Britain charged with the mission of persuading the tribal kings to not resist the invasion of the Romans."]}, {"page": "Pallas and the Centaur", "response": ["There was a novel written about it by Linda Proud which features a fictional retelling of Botticelli, this painting, and its possible interpretations."]}, {"page": "History of Florence", "response": ["*Linda Proud's trilogy of novels beginning with A Tabernacle for the Sun gives an excellent introduction to Renaissance Florence, its culture, history and philosophy. http://www.lindaproud.com/"]}, {"page": "Valerie Petts", "response": ["* Consider England by Valerie Petts and Linda Proud, Shepheard-Walwyn (1994). ."]}]}}
