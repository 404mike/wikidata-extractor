He moved on to Championship club Crystal Palace, where he was dogged by injuries. He spent four years at Selhurst Park, and spent time on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion, Millwall, Swindon Town, and Leyton Orient. He signed with Port Vale in November 2012, and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313. He joined Mansfield Town for a brief stay in August 2013.

He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons.
