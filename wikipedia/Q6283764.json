Social scientist Joseph Hanlon described De Soto as \"an economist of the far right\" and that \"the risk that people will be thrown off their land is fundamental to De Soto's system of bringing capitalism to the poor\", summarizing that landlessness for some impoverished individuals \"is intrinsic to his strategy\". The Guardian described de Soto as \"a radical free-market economist\". Geohegan states that the United States government under President Ronald Reagan and his successor George H. W. Bush adopted de Soto's work as the main strategy of the United States' foreign policy towards developing countries since \"de Soto's interpretation of underdevelopment seemed to validate the emerging 'neoliberal' US policies\". According to de Soto, Peru was not poor because of international inequality enforced by the globalized economy but due to Peru's own economic regulation. Reagan \u2013 whose administration provided funding to found de Soto's ILD \u2013  George H. W. Bush and Bush's successor Bill Clinton would continue promoting de Soto's work. Timothy Mitchell says that de Soto's background as a European economist was often ignored by American neoliberals promoting him, writing that his popularity and experience \"came to depend on his identity as a neoliberal from the third world, willing to describe the poverty of the global south as a self-inflicted injury unconnected to its relationship to the north\".  Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Andrew Natsios would later advocate de Soto's work, stating \"Instead of seeing the developing world as victims of capitalism, Hernando argues 'We're inflicting our own wounds' ... Since he is Peruvian, he can make this argument credibly\"."]}, {"page": "Bernard Dixon", "response": ["He was a member of the European Federation of Biotechnology's Task Group on Public Perceptions of Biotechnology. He served on committees for bodies such as the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Council for Science and Society and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. In 1974, with his colleague Joseph Hanlon, he investigated Uri Gellar, showing that his ability to bend metal objects was not paranormal. Dixon campaigned on issues such as the risk of antibiotic resistance from use of the drugs in cattle to promote growth."]}, {"page": "Wagner Group", "response": ["On 8 April, the military launched helicopter strikes against militant bases in two districts. Journalist Joseph Hanlon published a photograph showing one of the helicopter gunships that took part in the attack and said it was manned by Wagner PMCs. However, two other sources cited by the Daily Maverick stated the contractors belonged to the South African private military company Dyck Advisory Group (DAG) and that the Wagner Group had pulled out of Mozambique in March."]}, {"page": "Hanlon, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Hanlon"]}]}}
