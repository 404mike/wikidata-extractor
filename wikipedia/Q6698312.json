One time, on their way to their sisters, the brothers camp out at night and each of them, on consecutive nights, stand vigil and kill a \"Koutch\u00e9dra\" (Kulshedra) that came to devour them. On the youngest's turn, the koutch\u00e9dra snuffes out their light, and he has to get fire. He meets the \"Mother of the Night\", who alternates the day and night cycle, and ties her, so the day may be delayed. The youngest brother meets a band of brigands, lures them to the king's palace and decapitates one by one. He loosens the Mother of Night and returns to his brothers. Meanwhile, the king sees the brigands' corpses and decides to build a khan where everyone is to tell their story, in hopes of finding the person responsible. He discovers the youngest brother and marries him to his daughter. One day, the king says he will free some prisoner due to the upcoming eedding, and his soon-to-be son-in-law insists that he freed a \"one half iron and half man\" too. He does, and the prisoner escapes with the princess. The youth visits his brothers-in-law, takes a ride on an eagle's back and reaches the villain's hideout. He meets his wife and they conspire with each other to ask \"Half-man-half-iron\" where his strength was hidden: outside his body, in three pigeons inside a hare inside a boar's silver tusk.Garnett, Lucy Mary Jane and Stuart-Glennie, John S.
