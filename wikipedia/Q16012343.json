[...] Its strength lies in the fact that it is imaginatively conceived in terms of the detailed development of the plot, and well written. ...if the standard is maintained, it will be a series well worth watching, and not just by the children, either\". Later, during the broadcast of \"The Time of the Ice Box\", many of the children watching were frightened by the scene where Edith Joynton (Peggy Thorpe-Bates) ages to death thanks to an incorrect dosage of HA57; this scene was edited slightly when the series was repeated in 1973."]}, {"page": "Georgy Girl", "response": ["* Peggy Thorpe-Bates as Hospital Sister"]}, {"page": "Rumpole of the Bailey", "response": ["* Hilda Rumpole (Joyce Heron) (Original Play for Today \"Pilot\") Peggy Thorpe-Bates (Series 1\u20133 and Special); (Marion Mathie) (Series 4\u20137): Privately referred to by Rumpole as \"She Who Must Be Obeyed\" \u2013 a reference to the Rider Haggard novel She.
