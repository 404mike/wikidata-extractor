The painting was exhibited at the 1872 Salon with a quotation from La Fontaine, Quand la bise fut venue (When the north wind blew), and was seen as a critique of the lately deposed Napoleon III, who had led the nation into a disastrous war with Prussia. Another with the same title, alternatively known as \"Girl with a Mandolin\" (1890), was painted by Edouard Bisson (1856\u20131939) and depicts a gypsy musician in a sleeveless dress shivering in the falling snow. Also so-named is the painting by Henrietta Rae (a student of Lefebvre's) of a naked girl with a mandolin slung over her back who is cowering among the falling leaves at the root of a tree.View on Flickr"]}, {"page": "1891 in art", "response": ["* Henrietta Rae \u2013 Miss Nightingale at Scutari (1854)"]}, {"page": "1901 in art", "response": ["* Henrietta Rae \u2013 portrait of Lord Dufferin"]}, {"page": "1894 in art", "response": ["* Henrietta Rae \u2013 Psyche at the Throne of Venus"]}, {"page": "Ernest Normand", "response": ["In 1884 he married the painter and writer, Henrietta Rae (1859\u20131928).
