The club's closest rivals are Cliftonville, with whom they contest the North Belfast derby. Rivalries also exist with other Belfast sides such as Linfield and Glentoran.", "In turn, this meant more expeditions into Europe as the Crues took on teams from Switzerland, Denmark, Lithuania and Georgia within a five-year span. The team of the 1990s is regarded as one of the best in the history of the club, with a large part of the success revolving around the core of Kevin McKeown, Glenn Dunlop, Martin Murray, Sid Burrows, and the attacking duo of Glenn Hunter (who would go on to set a club goalscoring record of 157 goals) and Stephen Baxter.", "The team was affectionately known as the \"God Squad\", due to the large number of Christians in the playing squad and staff.Pastor's Past Karmel City Church In addition to the first team and the reserves, teams at under-16 and under-18 level were introduced for the first time as the club looked to nurture and develop local talent in the area. Roy Walker suddenly resigned as manager in May 1998, just prior to the club's centenary dinner celebrations at Belfast City Hall. He was the longest-serving manager in the club's history until surpassed by Stephen Baxter in October 2013.", "Subsequently, a lack of funds saw the Seaview fortunes decline as the decade came to a close, with Dublin-based player-managers Aaron Callaghan and Martin Murray both resigning after one year apiece in charge. Callaghan managed to lead the club to third place in his sole season in charge, but it would be many years before the Crues would challenge at such a high level again. Former player Gary McCartney took over the managerial reins in July 2000. The team narrowly retained Premier Division status after a nail-biting play-off success over Lisburn Distillery thanks to a hat-trick from veteran Stephen Baxter in May 2001 but McCartney resigned just over twelve months later because of the limited budget at his disposal.", "Dornan's next season in charge was not as successful. He was sacked just after midway through the season, as the Crues lay at the bottom of the table, despite having guided the team to the County Antrim Shield final, which they lost to Linfield. Dornan was the first ever Crusaders manager to be sacked. Former striker and fans' favourite Stephen Baxter was appointed as manager but despite an improvement in results, he could not keep the club in the Premier League, with the Crues losing out to Glenavon in a relegation play-off, the first ever Premier League team to lose to a First Division side in the play-offs. The relegation was the first time Crusaders had ever been relegated from any league, and meant an end to 56 consecutive seasons of senior football.", "===Stephen Baxter era (2005\u2013present)===", "|Manager||Stephen Baxter", "| Stephen Baxter"]}, {"page": "Roy Walker (footballer)", "response": ["He later became player-manager of Crusaders, in 1989.

But in 2005 Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter whom Dunne had played with for Crusaders came calling for him to come back to Seaview. It was an offer Dunne could not refuse. But by now \"Crues\" were in the second tier of Irish Football and were chasing promotion and they achieved it by winning the IFA Championship in the 2005-06 season.

He started his career at Coagh United, where he made his debut in 2007 whilst working as a joiner. In January 2010, Dallas played in a 4\u20130 Irish Cup sixth round defeat against Crusaders, with Dallas' performance prompting Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter to talk to Dallas and his father about the possibility of offering him a contract. A deal was agreed later that week, with Dallas joining Crusaders in the summer of 2010, training once a week and earning \u00a370 a week. He made his debut against Donegal Celtic on 7 August 2010. He scored his first goals against Coleraine on 21 August, and his first goal at Seaview proved to be the winning goal in a 5\u20134 victory over Glenavon. In his first year at Crusaders, Dallas received six prizes at the Annual Player of the Year awards ceremony. He was chosen as both the Northern Ireland Football Writers' Association Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year for the 2010\u201311 season. Dallas made 38 appearances and scored 16 goals during the 2010\u201311 season.", "Dallas has been noted for his versatility, with Dallas able to play as a full-back or winger on either side of the pitch or as a central midfielder and having once played in five positions in the same match for Northern Ireland. Former Leeds manager David O'Leary stated that \"the big thing about him is the way he is adaptable to so many positions and, when he has to play in all those different positions, he doesn't let the side down in any way\". He has often been described as a utility player, with Darren Bent describing him as \"probably the best utility man in history\". Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter stated that \"he could play left-wing, right-wing, centre-forward or the number 10. People have had him playing left-back and right-back but any position works for him because of his great athleticism to get around the park and his brain.\""]}, {"page": "North Belfast derby", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Stephen Baxter ||  Crusaders || 6 || - || - || -|| - || 3 || - || - || 9"]}, {"page": "2012 Setanta Sports Cup Final", "response": ["|colspan=4| Stephen Baxter"]}, {"page": "Stephen Baxter", "response": ["Stephen Baxter may refer to:", "*Stephen Baxter (author) (born 1957), English science fiction author", "*Stephen Baxter (footballer) (born 1965), Northern Irish football manager and ex-player"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Football League", "response": ["||Stephen Baxter (Linfield)"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 NIFL Premiership", "response": ["|  Stephen Baxter"]}, {"page": "List of longest managerial reigns in association football", "response": ["| Stephen Baxter"]}]}}
