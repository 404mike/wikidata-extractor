Ringdove took part in the Action of 17 December 1809 in which a British squadron, first under Captain Volant Vashon Ballard and then under Captain Samuel James Ballard, destroyed two to attack two French fl\u00fbtes, Loire and Seine. During the operations, French batteries opened fire on the British force, one shot striking Ringdove, then off Pointe Lizard. Dowers landed a shore party that stormed the battery, capturing it in 15 minutes. He demolished the position and withdrew to his ship, rejoining Volant Ballard off Anse la Barque at Basse Terre Island.

Two French ships were discovered moored in a strong position in Anse-la-Barque. Blonde was deputed to lead the attack and bore the brunt of the action, which left the enemy frigates in flames. A fuller account of this action can be found in The Naval History of Great Britain. The action led to the capture of Guadeloupe and Volant Ballard was honourably mentioned. Two paintings depicting the action were bequeathed by Ballard in his will to his son Edward Humphrey."]}, {"page": "Roquebert's expedition to the Caribbean", "response": ["Ineffectual efforts were made to capture the fl\u00fbtes, but it was not until the arrival of the 74-gun  under Captain Samuel James Ballard that an attack was made in earnest. As small ships engaged the batteries on shore, two frigates entered the bay and attacked the fl\u00fbtes, causing both to surrender in an hour-long engagement. Both French ships were badly damaged and a fire started during the engagement was able to rapidly spread through them, destroying both ships in succession. Many of the French crew escaped ashore from the wrecks, while others were picked up by British ships. The blockade of Guadeloupe was successfully maintained, and the island was captured in a coordinated invasion a month later. Roquebert's remaining ships were intercepted on 16 January by a patrolling British frigate, but successfully escaped pursuit and eventually returned undamaged to France.", "At 08:30 on the morning of 18 December, a small boat sailed from Anse la Barque with a message offering the British a temporary truce. Simultaneously the British ship of the line HMS Sceptre arrived from Fort Royal on Martinique under the command of Captain Samuel James Ballard, who immediately assumed command of the diverse squadron assembled at the entrance to the bay. Ballard dismissed the French negotiators and ordered an immediate attack on the anchored frigates. His plan was simple: Blonde and Thetis would enter the harbour and engage the fl\u00fbtes directly, while Sceptre and Freija would engage the gun batteries to prevent them targeting the small brigs bringing up the rear. The brigs would be towing boats full of sailors and Royal Marines, who would storm the French ships and gun positions as they were engaged with the larger warships."]}, {"page": "Invasion of Guadeloupe (1810)", "response": ["Beckwith mustered 6,700 men from a variety of garrisons and sources, his men belonging to the 3rd, 4th, 6th and 8th West India Regiments, the 1st Foot, 15th Foot, 19th Foot, 25th Foot, 63rd Foot, 90th Foot and the Royal York Rangers, as well as 300 garrison artillerymen and various militia forces. These troops were split into two divisions: the largest, 3,700 men under Beckwith with subordinate command given to Major General Thomas Hislop, was to be deployed at Le Gosier on the island's southern shore.James, p. 313 The second division, 2,450 men under Brigadier General George Harcourt, was initially ordered to wait on the \u00celes des Saintes before being deployed after the main attack to the rear of the French garrison. A small reserve under Brigadier General Charles Wale would follow the main assault to provide support if required. As the French had no significant naval resources on the island, the Royal Navy's contribution was much smaller than that required for the Martinique invasion the year before. Cochrane attached ships of the line to both divisions, Beckwith sailing in Cochrane's flagship HMS Pompee, accompanied by HMS Abercrombie with Commodore William Charles Fahie, while Harcourt sailed with Commodore Samuel James Ballard in HMS Sceptre. Ballard and Fahie were in command of the transports and smaller vessels that carried the invasion forces and bore responsibility for ensuring that the amphibious landings were successful as well as for any naval units that participated in the land campaign.Clowes, p. 290"]}, {"page": "Lawrence Halsted", "response": ["While sailing off Elba on the afternoon of 3 August Halsted's squadron, consisting of Phoenix, the 40-gun  under Captain Edward Leveson Gower and the 32-gun  under Captain Samuel James Ballard, intercepted a French convoy sailing off the west of the island.

The British gave chase, ranging up on Carr\u00e8re shortly after 8pm and opening fire. After 10 minutes of exchanging fire with Pomone Carr\u00e8re surrendered.

In subsequent days two sloops and two frigates joined the squadron. One of the sloops was , a sister-ship to Scorpion. Though a part of the squadron, Scorpion apparently missed out on the Action of 17 December 1809 in which a British squadron, first under Vashon Ballard and then under Captain Samuel James Ballard, destroyed two French frigates."]}, {"page": "Siege of Porto Ferrajo", "response": ["Then at 14:30 on 3 August, three of Warren's patrolling frigates, Phoenix under Captain Lawrence Halsted,  under Captain Edward Leveson-Gower and  under Captain Samuel James Ballard, discovered a sail off the western shore of Elba and gave chase. The ship was the 38-gun Carr\u00e8re under Captain Claude-Pascal Morel-Beaulieu, carrying 300 barrels of powder and escorting a convoy of small coastal vessels carrying military supplies from Porto Ercole to Porto Longone.Clowes, p. 451 Although Carr\u00e8re turned away from the British pursuit and actively engaged the lead ship Pomone with her stern-chasers (cannon mounted in the rear of the frigate), Carr\u00e8re was too laden to escape her opponents. After a ten-minute chase as Pearl cut off the route to Porto Longone and Pomone manoeuvered into a firing position, Captain Morel-Beaulieu surrendered. Losses on Pomone were limited to two killed and four wounded, two of whom subsequently died; Carr\u00e8re had suffered \"tolerably severe\" casualties in the engagement from a complement of 352. The delay caused by the brief chase however had allowed the coastal ships to disperse and flee so that all of them avoided capture and some even reached Porto Longone."]}, {"page": "Samuel Ballard", "response": ["*Samuel James Ballard (1765\u20131829), Royal Navy admiral"]}, {"page": "East Indies theatre of the French Revolutionary Wars", "response": ["Maintenance of the blockade of \u00cele de France was the responsibility of the substantial British squadron at the Cape Colony, which had suffered severely from unrest inspired by the Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain.

Intimidated the seamen surrendered, the incident followed by floggings and executions.Mostert, p. 213. Despite this paralysis, Sercey's squadron was in no position to contest control of the Indian Ocean: supplies and manpower were severely limited and the Colonial Committee, still resentful following the incident with the agents in 1796, was reluctant to offer support.Parkinson, p. 120. Sercey's only operations were limited cruises in the Seychelles and the supply of 300 reinforcements to Batavia during the summer of 1797, while Cyb\u00e8le was sent back to France in the spring of 1797 and Vertu, R\u00e9g\u00e9ner\u00e9e and Seine followed in early 1798. Vertu and R\u00e9g\u00e9ner\u00e9e passed undetected into the Atlantic until they halted at the \u00celes de Los on 24 April. There they were discovered by the 32-gun frigate  under Captain Samuel James Ballard. Sailing to investigate Ballard came under fire from the French ships and was forced to pass between them, firing broadsides in each direction as he did so. Chased by R\u00e9g\u00e9ner\u00e9e, Pearl withdrew to Sierra Leone with damaged rigging and one man killed.James, Vol. 2, p. 219. Seine was also intercepted, by a squadron of frigates from the Brest blockade near the Penmarks. Fleeing south, the ship battled its pursuers in the action of 30 June 1798, which ended with Seine and the British frigates  and  all ashore near La Rochelle.
