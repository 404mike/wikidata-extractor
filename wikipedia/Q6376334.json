Corey played with the King's Company and the United Company, and had one of the longest careers of any actress in her generation. In \"The humble petition of Katherine Corey\" (see below), she stated that she \"was the first and is the last of all the actresses that were constituted by King Charles the Second at His Restauration.\"Correy started her career under her maiden name, Mitchell, but was Mrs. Corey by 1663. \"Mrs Corey was a big woman with a gift for comedy. She was popular in a variety of roles, but especially in old women parts: scolding wives, mothers, governesses, waiting women, and bawds.\" In his Diary, Samuel Pepys, who admired Corey's talents, calls her \"Doll Common\" after her part in Ben Jonson's The Alchemist.\nIn her three decades on the stage, Corey played a wide range of roles; in revivals of plays from the period of English Renaissance theatre:\n\nLady Would-be in Jonson's Volpone\nMrs. Otter in Epicene\nSempronia in Catiline\nArane in Beaumont and Fletcher's A King and No King\nAbigail in The Scornful Lady\nDuchess Sophia in Rollo Duke of Normandy\nQuisania in The Island Princess\nMrs. Trainwell in Brome's The Northern Lass\u2014 and in contemporary works, by John Dryden:\n\nOctavia in All for Love\nMelissa in The Maiden Queen\nan Englishwoman in Amboyna\nBromia in Amphitryon\u2014 and by William Wycherley:\n\nLucy in The Country Wife\nWidow Blackacre in The Plain Dealer\nMrs. Joyner in Love in a Wood\u2014 and Nathaniel Lee:\n\nAgrippina in The Tragedy of Nero\nCumana in Sophonisba, or the Death of Hannibal\nSysigambis in The Rival Queens\u2014 and other authors:\n\nCleorin in Boyle's The Black Prince\nRosellia, leader of the Amazons, in D'Urfey's The Commonwealth of Women\nMrs. Touchstone in Tate's Cuckold's Haven\nCrowstich in D'Urfey's Love for Money\nMopsophil in Behn's The Emperor of the Moon\nQuickthrift in Edward Howard's The Man of Newmarket\u2014 and many other parts, in plays by Edward Ravenscroft, Thomas Southerne, Thomas Shadwell, and others. Corey had a notable success as Strega, the title character in Thomas Duffet's The Amorous Old Woman in 1674. She played in other Duffet works too:\n\nRedstreak in Psyche Debauch'd\nTeresa in The Spanish Rogue.Corey's performance as Sempronia in Catiline was a focus of controversy. Nell Gwyn was quarrelling with the noblewoman Lady Elizabeth Harvey in 1669; Gwyn called the Lady a hermaphrodite and claimed to have repulsed her lesbian advances. Gwyn also bribed and coached Corey into mimicking Harvey in her role as Sempronia. Lady Harvey hired thugs to hiss Corey onstage and throw oranges at her. The matter caused a major scandal. Lady Harvey prevailed upon the Lord Chamberlain (her cousin Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester) to arrest Corey and interrogate her; but Harvey's rival Lady Castlemaine got the King to release the actress. (Gwyn and Lady Harvey later became friends).\nIn the Spring of 1689, Mrs. Corey became involved in an attempt by some actors in the United Company to form an independent troupe under the management of Henry Killigrew. When that effort failed, manager Charles Killigrew would not allow Corey back into the United Company; she appealed to the Lord Chamberlain, with the \"humble petition\" cited above, to be re-admitted, and won re-instatement.\nShe continued to act a variety of parts \u2014\n\nMrs. Bumfiddle in D'Urfey's The Marriage-Hater Matched\nMrs. Flint in Behn's The Widow Ranter\nThe Abbess of Charlton in The Merry Devil of Edmonton\u2014 and others during the final phase of her career. (Though in her 1689 \"humble petition\" to the Lord Chamberlain, she noted that she was never paid more than 30 shillings a week.)\nAs one of the earliest actresses with the King's Company, Corey has been nominated as a possibility for the honour of the \"first English actress,\" who played Desdemona in an 8 December 1660 performance of Othello. Most commentators, however, think Corey's lack of physical beauty makes her an unlikely Desdemona, and prefer Margaret Hughes or Anne Marshall for the distinction.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1660", "response": ["* December 8 \u2013 The first English actress appears on the professional stage in England in a non-singing r\u00f4le, as Desdemona in Othello, following reopening of the theatres (variously considered to be Margaret Hughes, Anne Marshall or Katherine Corey)."]}, {"page": "1660 in literature", "response": ["*December 8 \u2013 The first English actress to appear on the professional stage in England in a non-singing r\u00f4le, as Desdemona in Othello, is variously considered to be Margaret Hughes, Anne Marshall or Katherine Corey."]}, {"page": "Volpone", "response": ["After the Restoration, the play enjoyed a lengthy prominence: John Genest records over fifty performances before 1770.
