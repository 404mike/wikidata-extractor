Baylis invented it in response to the need to communicate information about AIDS to the \"people of Africa\". He ran a company in his name dedicated to helping inventors to develop and protect their ideas and to find a route to market.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 13", "response": ["*1937 \u2013 Trevor Baylis, English inventor, invented the wind-up radio (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "Wallace and Gromit", "response": ["Wallace and Gromit spearhead the fundraising for two children's charities, Wallace & Gromit's Children's Foundation, which supports children's hospices and hospitals in the United Kingdom, and Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, the Bristol Children's Hospital Charity.

Van Outen's cheeky \"Essex girl\" personality played off well against the quick wit of Vaughan, and together they recovered audience figures to record levels.

His ability to build a rapport with regulars from different walks of life such as Trevor Baylis, Mark Bright and Drusilla Beyfus, as well as the depth of knowledge he revealed in his Shed interviews, established him as something of a polymath.

He said his problems stemmed from Freeplay Energy which he had joined in partnership to manufacture his radios. However, they had then altered Baylis' original design which used spring power to one that used a crank that charged an internal battery. This change meant the product was no longer subject to his patents. Baylis began a lobbying campaign to overhaul the patent systems in the UK to protect inventors from intellectual property theft.

The modern clockwork radio was designed and patented in 1991 by British inventor Trevor Baylis as a response to the HIV/AIDS crisis.

In 1994, British accountant Chris Staines and his South African partner, Rory Stear, secured the worldwide license to the invention and cofounded Baygen Power Industries (now Freeplay Energy Ltd), which produced the first commercial model. The key to its design, which is no longer in use, was the use of a constant-velocity spring to store the potential energy.
