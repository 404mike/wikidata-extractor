This match featured the Essex 1st XI vs an All Star XI, which included leading Test wicket-taker Muttiah Muralitharan and former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff among others. He was replaced as captain in December 2015. His continued form, particularly behind the stumps, was one of the factors that led to two promising wicket-keeper batsmen, Adam Wheater and Ben Foakes to leave the county to further develop their careers. In 2018 he shared keeping duties with Wheater who had returned from Hampshire, and then Foster retired at the end of the season after hearing that Essex would not be renewing his contract."]}, {"page": "List of England Test cricketers", "response": ["| 50|| Ben Foakes ||"]}, {"page": "England Lions cricket team", "response": ["|Ben Foakes ||  ||Right-handed || \u2014 ||Surrey || 50 "]}, {"page": "Steven Davies", "response": ["In April 2016, Davies stated his desire to resume wicketkeeping in an effort to increase his chances of a recall to the England team.
