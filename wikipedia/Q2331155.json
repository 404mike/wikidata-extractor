William Howitt's visit was quite different: his account is called \"A day-dream at Tintagel\" (in Visits to Remarkable Places). Relatively few works of fiction have Tintagel as a setting: these include Anthony Trollope's short story Malachi's Cove and the Charles and Alice Muriel Williamson's epistolary novel Set in Silver published in 1909. Ernest George Henham was a novelist resident in Devon who used the pseudonym John Trevena for many of his books; it is probable that the surname he chose was derived from the original name for Tintagel, though his writings are concerned mainly with Devon. Tintagel features prominently in Edith Wharton's final, unfinished novel, The Buccaneers, the protagonist of which, Nan St. George, meets her future husband, the Duke of Tintagel, while exploring the ruins of Tintagel Castle. Wharton styled the characters as Duke and Duchess of Tintagel, while Tintagel actually lies within the Duchy of Cornwall; in the novel, the Duke and Duchess live in a newer, fictional Tintagel Castle, built in approximately the late 18th century."]}, {"page": "1887 in literature", "response": ["*October 12 \u2013 Dinah Craik, English novelist and poet (born 1826)"]}, {"page": "1826 in literature", "response": ["*April 20 \u2013 Dinah Craik, n\u00e9e Mulock, English novelist and poet (died 1887)"]}, {"page": "Tewkesbury", "response": ["The town features many Medieval and Tudor buildings, but is most famous for Tewkesbury Abbey, a Norman abbey church, originally part of a monastery, which was saved from the Dissolution of the Monasteries by King Henry VIII after being bought by the townspeople for the price of the lead on the roof to use as their parish church.C.
