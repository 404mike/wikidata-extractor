Matheson broke two toes during the action, and was also the getaway driver.  The stone having broken in two during the raid, Matheson took one piece, leaving it with a friend in England before collecting it at a later date.  A description of her car was issued, however the stone was not found for four months.  Police attended her family home to question her about the theft, at which point she lied, and told them that it was in a nearby peat bog.  No charges were brought against either Matheson or her fellow students.
