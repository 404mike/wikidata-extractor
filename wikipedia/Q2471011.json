To preserve the mystery, Koquillion was credited in the first episode as being played by \"Sydney Wilson\", a name made up by the production team in tribute to two of the creators of Doctor Who, Sydney Newman and Donald Wilson. When designing Koquillion, costume designer Daphne Dare took inspiration from a close-up of a fly.

In 2009, Mark Braxton of Radio Times felt that the story \"kicks off so well\", but failed to take the opportunity to discuss ideas such as predestination; he praised Vicki's \"vibrant\" character, and described the scene of the Doctor in a Dalek casing as \"one of the few elements that make this rather tedious traipse memorable\".", "A novelisation of this serial, written by Glyn Jones, was published by Target Books and W.
