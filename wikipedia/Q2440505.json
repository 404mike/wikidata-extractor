He was capped five times at senior level for Scotland during the 1980s, scoring one goal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 22", "response": ["*  1959   \u2013 Frank McAvennie, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["|1986|| Tony Cottee|| Frank McAvennie"]}, {"page": "Johnstone Burgh F.C.", "response": ["* Frank McAvennie: Former St Mirren, West Ham United, Celtic and Scotland striker."]}, {"page": "Frank Lampard", "response": ["Lampard began his career at West Ham United, his father's former club, joining the youth team in 1994, his schoolboy hero being West Ham striker, Frank McAvennie. Lampard joined West Ham when his father was the assistant coach, entering as an apprentice in the youth team in 1994 and signing a professional contract the following year. He went on loan to Second Division club Swansea City in October 1995, debuting in his team's victory 2\u20130 over Bradford City and scoring his first career goal in a match against Brighton & Hove Albion.

Financed initially by the club's then owner, Lawrence Marlborough, Souness and club chairman David Holmes embarked upon a bold strategy of reclaiming the footballing ascendancy Rangers had lacked in recent years, having not won the league title since 1978, with all of the Scottish league titles since then being claimed by their arch-rivals Celtic, and the emerging \"New Firm\" of Aberdeen and Dundee United. A 33-year-old Souness arrived at Ibrox with a reputation as one of Europe's leading midfielders, a view evidenced by his success at Liverpool and, to a lesser extent, with Sampdoria. His signing was unusual in that Scottish clubs had rarely been able to sign top-quality internationals, including Scots, from other leagues. Scottish clubs had often found themselves being in the position of selling their top players to English clubs, notable examples being Kenny Dalglish (sold from Celtic to Liverpool in 1977), Gordon Strachan (sold from Aberdeen to Manchester United in 1984) and Frank McAvennie (sold from St Mirren to West Ham United in 1985)."]}, {"page": "Mo Johnston", "response": ["In July 1989, Johnston opted not to return to Celtic (who had recently sold his replacement Frank McAvennie back to West Ham United) and instead joined Graeme Souness's Rangers. From the early 20th century onwards, Catholics had not been knowingly signed by Rangers, nor employed in other prominent roles as an 'unwritten rule'. Johnston was \"their first major Roman Catholic signing\". He was the highest-profile Catholic to sign for the club since the World War I era, though other Catholics had signed for Rangers before. The move angered both Celtic and Rangers supporters. A handful of Rangers fans burned scarves and threatened to hand in season tickets over the signing but attendances held firm while Celtic fans referred to Johnston as Judas. Rangers' kitman Jimmy Bell protested by making Johnston arrange his own kit and withholding from him the chocolate bars dispensed to other players until he scored against Celtic. He won over a lot of Rangers fans in November 1989, when he scored a late winning goal in an Old Firm derby match.", "He had been expected to make the squad for Mexico 86 but was dropped by Alex Ferguson (caretaker manager until the end of the World Cup after the death of Jock Stein in September 1985) after a late night incident during Scotland's preparations for their play-off against Australia in November 1985, in which Johnston had disturbed a member of the coaching staff in his hotel room. In Ferguson's autobiography, Managing My Life, which was published 14 years later, Ferguson stated that he had already warned Johnston about his conduct after he and teammate Frank McAvennie had bought drinks for themselves, fellow Scotland teammates and a group of young women in the hotel bar."]}, {"page": "John Aldridge", "response": ["In his 27th year, Aldridge finally had the chance of play in the First Division. He was the third-highest scorer in the division (only surpassed by Gary Lineker and Frank McAvennie) and netted six goals in United's League Cup-winning run in 1986, which culminated in a 3\u20130 victory over Queens Park Rangers in the final at Wembley. This is Oxford's only major trophy to date. His 23 goals from 39 games were also crucial in Oxford avoiding relegation."]}, {"page": "Soccer AM", "response": ["*\"Feed The Iron Curtain\" (2002\u201303) \u2013 fans had to kick the ball through the Iron Curtain as many times as possible in one minute.  Meanwhile, the Eastern European substitutes (wearing red TCCCP tracksuits - a pun on the old \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 shirts and TCP the antiseptic) would warm-up, a memorable moment from \"Feed the Iron Curtain\" was when one of the celebrities missed the \"goal\" and kicked the rebounding ball in frustration and the ball hit one of the eastern European substitutes in the face. This celebrity was Frank McAvennie and Tim and Helen loved it so much that they renamed the car park The Frank McAvennie Car Park in his honour."]}, {"page": "John Lyall", "response": ["West Ham spent the first four years back in the top flight consolidating their position. Long serving Trevor Brooking and Frank Lampard both retired and Billy Bonds was struggling with the effects of first team football. Lyall again attempted to rebuild the team, bringing Frank McAvennie from St Mirren and Mark Ward from Oldham Athletic. 28 goals from McAvennie, 25 from Tony Cottee and an eighteen-game unbeaten run saw Lyall take West Ham to their highest ever league finish in the 1985\u201386 First Division campaign when they finished third behind champions Liverpool and runners-up Everton. However, they were unable to compete in the UEFA Cup because of the ban on English teams from European competition arising from the previous year's Heysel Disaster."]}, {"page": "Tony Cottee", "response": ["He was a prolific goalscorer especially in his West Ham days, where he was voted the PFA Young Player of the Year in 1986, the year where West Ham finished third (their highest league finish to date) and came just four points away from the title. He scored 20 times in the league during that season, though his strike partner Frank McAvennie did even better with 26 league goals. Still, their 46-goal strike partnership was the most prolific in the league that season.", "1986\u201387 saw Cottee score 22 league goals \u2013 which would be the highest of his career. However, Frank McAvennie alongside him could only manage seven league goals that season and this contributed to a downturn in West Ham's form as they finished 15th. Cottee managed a further 13 league goals in 1987\u201388, but McAvennie had been sold to Celtic early in the season and the failure of manager John Lyall to find an adequate replacement contributed to West Ham disappointing in the league again, finishing 16th. By this time, the 23-year-old Cottee had already managed 212 league games and 92 goals for Hammers."]}, {"page": "Alan Brazil", "response": ["His international appearances were limited as Scotland had a number of other strikers at this time such as Kenny Dalglish, Charlie Nicholas, Mo Johnston, Steve Archibald, Paul Sturrock, Joe Jordan, Frank McAvennie, Davie Dodds, Frank McGarvey and Andy Gray who were preferred to Brazil."]}, {"page": "Alan Devonshire", "response": ["In the 1980\u201381 season Devonshire's career flourished. His partnership with Trevor Brooking formed the cornerstone of West Ham's push for promotion back to the First Division. He also played in European football for the first time and was a member of the side which reached to 1981 League Cup Final. He collected a Second Division title medal as they won promotion, losing only four games. Devonshire continued to be a regular member of the West Ham side in the First Division until a game on 7 January 1984. Playing against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup, he snapped three ligaments in his right knee. He tried to make a comeback in March 1985 in two cup games against Wimbledon but again broke down. It was 19 months from his first injury to his full return, in a game against Birmingham City on 17 August 1985. His long spell out injured had resulted in him losing some of his pace but still maintaining his ability to pass the ball well. He made the final pass for many of the goals scored by teammates, Tony Cottee and Frank McAvennie in the 1985\u201386 season as West Ham finished third in the First Division."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C. (1969\u20131986)", "response": ["The 1985\u201386 season started spectacularly for United, who won all of their first ten league matches (a club record start to a season) and were ten points clear at the top of the table as early as October. They were unbeaten from their first 15 matches and it seemed that nothing would stop United from winning their first league title since 1967. However, their form slumped dramatically in the new year, with an injury to Bryan Robson meaning he missed much of the season, and they could only finish in fourth place. The club had decided to sell Mark Hughes against his wishes, and he developed a drinking problem which seriously affected his form before signing for Barcelona in the close season for around \u00a32\u00a0million. The mid-season arrival of new strikers Terry Gibson and Peter Davenport did little to halt United's decline. They had finished 12 points behind champions Liverpool and were also ten points adrift of runners-up Everton, whose top scorer Gary Lineker linked up with Hughes at Barcelona that summer, and eighth points behind a West Ham United side who had emerged as surprise title contenders thanks largely to 26 goals that season from Scottish striker Frank McAvennie."]}]}}
