They are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the United States.", "Bring Me the Horizon's founding members came from diverse musical backgrounds within metal and rock. Matt Nicholls and Oliver Sykes had a common interest in American metalcore such as Norma Jean and Skycamefalling, and used to attend local hardcore punk shows. They later met Lee Malia, who spoke with them about thrash metal and melodic death metal bands like Metallica and At the Gates; Malia had also been part of a Metallica tribute band before meeting the pair. Bring Me the Horizon officially formed in March 2004, when the members were aged 15 to 17. Curtis Ward, who also lived in the Rotherham area, joined Sykes, Malia and Nicholls on drums. Bassist Matt Kean, who was in other local bands, completed the line-up.

Alter The Press! 30 December 2011. Retrieved 6 January 2012. Draper first released an \"officially sanctioned\" remix of the song \"Blessed with a Curse\" in May 2011. The EP was originally supposed to be released in time for New Year's Day, and made available for download and purchase though Bring Me the Horizon's website, but the EP's release was cancelled due to the band's \"current management and label situation\".", "Bring Me the Horizon have attempted to grow and change with each album, believing they should be different. Raziq Rauf, writing for Drowned in Sound, described Count Your Blessings as possessing \"Norma Jean-style thunderous riffs mixed with some dastardly sludgy doom moments and more breakdowns than your dad's old Nissan Sunny.\" Metal Hammer described Suicide Season as a \"creative, critical and commercial success\" for the band as they started to adopt a more eclectic style, with its \"crushingly heavy party deathcore\". Leading up to its release, Oliver Sykes described it as \"100% different to Count Your Blessings\" and noted the album sounds \"more rock than metal\".

With the exception of Count Your Blessings, the band has always written in a secluded location to avoid being distracted. Oliver Sykes' lyrics have a strong feeling of catharsis for him. He mainly draws from personal experience and has described the band's live performances as therapeutic. In 2006, when asked about the lyrics of Count Your Blessings, as they had been criticised for their content solely fixated on heartbreak and other themes that were called \"shallow and meaningless\", he responded \"My life's never been that bad so I've not got that much to talk about.\"", "Lee Malia has stated that the typical writing process involves Oliver Sykes writing the main structure of the songs, followed by Malia writing the main riff. From this they would collaborate with each other to structure their work better and then later include the rest of the band in writing the rest of the song. The writing dynamic of Sempiternal, typically featured Sykes, Malia and newly introduced member Jordan Fish. Malia felt that with Fish's influence on the record he was pushed to create more inspired guitar riffs. As they all took a break before writing their fourth album, they felt less of a need for an isolated writing environment.", "During the band's early years, they were praised for their business acumen for selling mail-order merchandise and not relying on sales at live shows. Bring Me the Horizon's image has been characterised by the dominating personality of singer and front-man Oliver Sykes, and he has often been seen as the band's \"Poster boy\", bearing the brunt of the band's controversial reputation. In their early years, Bring Me the Horizon's image was infamously characterised by its members fashion sense and use of skinny-fit jeans, T-shirts with death metal band logos on the front and coloured hair/straightened hair. The band's image fit into what was called scene fashion. The effect of their fashion aesthetics showed people, in show promoter Iain Scott's perspective, that \"you don't have to look like a diabolical metalhead to be into metal or play in a metal band\". However, their fashion conscious appearance earned them a \"style over substance\" label.", "Many controversies that occurred in their early years greatly affected public perceptions of the band, particularly an incident in 2007 at Nottingham's Rock City venue, when a female fan claimed that Oliver Sykes had urinated on her. The charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence from CCTV footage in the area. There were several documented examples of violence against the band during their live shows, including Sykes being pepper sprayed on stage; and people getting onstage to assault the band.", "The band caused further controversy in February 2016 when Oliver Sykes trashed Coldplay's table at the 2016 NME Awards during a live performance of Bring Me the Horizon's track \"Happy Song\". Although some people thought the table trashing was because of a prior feud between the two bands relating to similar album artwork, Sykes later stated that the act was not an act of \"dirty protest\", and suggested that it was \"pure coincidence\" that Coldplay were sitting at the table he trampled. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin admitted that he had never even heard of Bring Me the Horizon before the incident and he laughed it off, stating that \"it was great, very 'rock and roll'\".", "2016 RiP Bring Me the Horizon - Oliver Sykes - by 2eight - 8SC6713.jpg|Oliver Sykes", "* Oliver Sykes \u2013 lead vocals ; keyboards, programming ", "* In a 2013 Alternative Press readers poll, Bring Me the Horizon was nominated for four categories: Best Vocalist (Oliver Sykes; position 3), Best Keyboardist (Jordan Fish; position 1), Single Of The Year (\"Shadow Moses\"; position 2) and \"Best Album Art\" (Sempiternal; position 2)."]}, {"page": "This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For", "response": ["* Oliver Sykes \u2013 lead vocals"]}, {"page": "Sykes", "response": ["* Oliver Sykes, front-man of Bring Me the Horizon"]}, {"page": "1986 in British music", "response": ["*20 November \u2014 Oliver Sykes, heavy metal vocalist (Bring Me the Horizon)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Kent", "response": ["*Oliver Sykes (born 1986) \u2013 metal singer"]}, {"page": "Architects (British band)", "response": ["Vocally Carter is seen as having a coarse and \"tortured\" screaming style and implements melodic singing to counter this.

During the initial recording of the album, Nordstr\u00f6m initially was absent from working with the band, in Sykes perspective, he drew his own conclusion based on Count Your Blessings. However, he turned up midway through their recording process and was shocked by the music they had written, and from that point became more involved in the recording process.
