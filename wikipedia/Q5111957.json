Sammy becomes an addict after she is involved in a car crash which leaves Owen paralysed. Writers depicted Sammy as an alcoholic throughout her entire duration. They also used Sammy and Owen's daughter, Louise, to provide Sammy with more dramatic stories such as child abandonment and depression. In 1996, producers chose to further explore the issue of child abandonment. Sammy leaves Louise home alone while she goes on holiday abroad and is arrested for neglecting her. The story outraged viewers and the show received numerous complaints. Sammy also has a relationship with an older man Tim Derby (Christopher Blake) and develops an obsession with Max Farnham (Steven Pinder), after they have a one-night stand. Lindsay decided to leave the role in 1993, but returned in 1996 and again in 2001 and remained until the series was cancelled by Channel 4. Sammy has received a mixed response from critics of the genre. Andy Medhurst from The Observer described Sammy as a \"deceitful\" and \"neglectful slattern\" for her parental skills.
