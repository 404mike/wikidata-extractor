He made his television debut in 2004, aged 19 at the UK Open. In addition to his two world championships, Lewis has won two other PDC majors: the 2013 European Championship and the 2014 UK Open. He is also a four-time winner of the PDC World Cup of Darts, partnering Phil Taylor.\nIn February 2018, Lewis was suspended by the PDC after an altercation following his win over Jose Justicia at the 2018 UK Open Qualifier 1.

A comfortable 5\u20131 win over Wales booked England's place in the final against the Australian pairing of Simon Whitlock and Paul Nicholson. Taylor won both his singles matches (including a 105.93 average against Whitlock). However, England lost the doubles meaning that the tie was level on points at 3\u20133 and consequently, would require a sudden-death leg.

However, Taylor suffered his first whitewash in the tournament's history as Van Gerwen thrashed him 7\u20130 in 13 minutes. Taylor bounced back a few days later to win the third UK Open Qualifier by defeating Adrian Lewis 6\u20132 and sealing the title with a nine-darter.
