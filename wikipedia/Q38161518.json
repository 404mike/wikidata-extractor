These authors argue that in multiple historical societies, such as Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient China, and the Islamic Civilization, the more intelligent individuals not only had access to contraception but were also more likely to use it effectively. While measuring the level of general intelligence (the g-factor) in periods for which there is no psychometric data is problematic, the authors suggest that one could estimate it via proxies, such as the number of innovations per century per billion people."]}, {"page": "RationalWiki", "response": ["A 2019 study of bias analysis based on word embedding in RationalWiki, Conservapedia, and Wikipedia by researchers from RWTH Aachen University found all had significant gender biases, reflecting classical gender stereotypes, but these biases were less pronounced in RationalWiki. Intelligence researchers Noah Carl and Michael Woodley have criticized the website's biographies of some intelligence researchers as attack pages filled with factual errors and an \"unchecked ideological bias\". RationalWiki's characterization of indigenous science as pseudoscience was described as \"Eurocentric gatekeeping\" by Lindy Orthia of Australian National University."]}]}}
