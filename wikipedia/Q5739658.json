Some of his songs became very successful in musical revues.\nBorn in Minsk, and musically trained in Vienna, he worked in London, for the first 15 years of the new century, as a composer of light songs, some of which were written for the new theatre form, revue.  After the First World War, Darewski had a long career as a conductor of light music, both in London and at English coastal resorts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1919 in music", "response": ["* \"Winnie The Window Cleaner\" w.m.
