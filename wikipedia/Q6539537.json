The most exciting encounter between the two sides was perhaps the 2003 relegation play-off between the two sides. A Brandywell Stadium packed with both sets of fans witnessed a Finn Harps side managed by Noel King (a former Derry City manager) lose a highly charged affair that finished 2\u20131 to Derry after an extra-time goal from Derry City favourite, Liam Coyle. A friendly rivalry is maintained between the two clubs, yet both have encountered times of trouble in recent years. One team has often been helped by the other in this regard.

The clubs have provided financial assistance to each other in the past and both sets of supporters socialise together when the clubs play one another.

The Derry striker, Liam Coyle, had received the ball from a quick Ciar\u00e1n Martyn free-kick and as he went down under the challenge of Shane Bradley, the ball rolled past goal-keeper Gary Ramsey and into the Harps' net. Confusion abounded in the Finn Harps defence and their players had seemed to stall in response as if to suggest they believed that they had heard a whistle or that play had been brought to a halt by the referee for the bad tackle on Coyle. Two of King's players, Shane Bradley and Kevin McHugh, were also later sent off from the field of play in separate incidents during the fiery second half of extra-time. McHugh's earlier equaliser had also caused controversy. The extraordinary amount of stoppage time played, which allowed McHugh the time and chance to score, was looked upon with a degree of scepticism by Derry's support, while his celebration infuriated certain others. After hitting the back of the net with the ball, McHugh ran straight for the dog-track, crouched down and ran along on his hands and knees, emulating the actions of a racing greyhound.", "The game was also City veteran Liam Coyle's last game as a player."]}, {"page": "Mark Farren", "response": ["Commenting on Farren attempting to surpass Liam Coyle's goal tally, Kenny stated:", "In August 2012, it was announced that he would be moving to Glenavon in January 2013 after signing a pre-contract agreement.
