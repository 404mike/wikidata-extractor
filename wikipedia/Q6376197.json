The early first decade of the 21st century saw the renewed popularity of T-shirts with slogans and designs with a strong inclination to the humorous and/or ironic. The trend has only increased later in this decade, embraced by celebrities, such as Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, and reflected back on them, too ('Team Aniston'). The political and social statements that T-shirts often display have become, since the first decade of the 21st century, one of the reasons that they have so deeply permeated different levels of culture and society. The statements also may be found to be offensive, shocking, or pornographic to some. Examples of T-shirt stores and designers known for using offensive and shocking messages include T-Shirt Hell and Apollo Braun. Many different organizations have caught on to the statement-making trend, including chain and independent stores, websites, and schools."]}, {"page": "Gravesend", "response": ["* Katharine Hamnett (born 1947), fashion designer."]}, {"page": "Tiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1", "response": ["Patrick Magee said  after being sentenced in 1986 for the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing, while his wife in the gallery wore a Katharine Hamnett-style T-shirt with the slogan.;  Loyalist paramilitary Michael Stone got past the republican security cordon to commit the 1988 Milltown Cemetery attack by saying .
