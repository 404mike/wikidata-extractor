He was born in Bedford and played for England at amateur level.\nBayes began his football career with Ilford who he joined after leaving the RAF. He left Ilford to join Torquay United while Torquay were still a non-league club. He remained at Plainmoor as Torquay progressed into the football league, but missed out on playing in Torquay's first ever game in the football league after an injury in training, Laurie Millsom taking his place.He soon regained his place in the first team, making his league debut on 7 September 1927 in a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Millwall. He remained a regular until the end of that season, but played mainly as a reserve after the signing of former England international Harold Gough. He retired after making 55 football league appearances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Gough", "response": ["On the completion of his suspension in December 1924, he returned to Castleford Town, before moving to Harrogate the following year from where he joined Oldham Athletic in 1926. He played four times for Oldham, moving to Bolton Wanderers in 1927, playing four league games before joining Torquay United in the summer of 1928. He immediately dislodged Archie Bayes as Torquay's first choice goalkeeper, missing just three games in his first season. He played 17 times the following season, before losing his place to Bayes through injury, and retired at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Joe Wright (footballer, born 1907)", "response": ["Wright was born in Gateshead in 1907.

He missed just one match in the 1930\u201331 season and was an ever-present for the first 28 league fixtures of the following season, after which time Laurie Millsom took over as first choice.

Significant contributions were also made by centre forwards Bob Ringland (9 goals in 14 appearances) and Lew Griffiths (8 goals in 12 appearances).
