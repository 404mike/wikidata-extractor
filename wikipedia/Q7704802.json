Norman Low couldn't bring his team to a top twelve finish, which meant the club spent 1958\u201359 in the new Fourth Division. Low adopted an attacking policy, but still relied on men like Sproson to hold the fort at the back. They took the Fourth Division title in 1958\u201359, though Sproson spent the first half of the season on the sidelines with an ankle injury. Terry Miles took his No. 6 jersey, though both Alan Martin and Roy Pritchard failed to hold on to the No. 3 jersey, which Sproson claimed in February 1959. It was the first time in six season he played less than forty games, for the next eleven seasons he would make at least thirty games a season."]}, {"page": "Ron Davies (footballer, born 1942)", "response": ["He made his debut in a 5\u20130 defeat to Workington in March 1960 and the following two seasons would see the club finish bottom of the Football League. However, Davies had a strong strike rate and was a regular in the team. Following a rare spell out of favour that saw him placed on the transfer list, his reply was to score four goals in a 6\u20131 win against Southport in October 1962. Port Vale manager Norman Low offered \u00a37,000 plus Terry Miles for Davies, but the deal fell through after the Vale directors vetoed the move. He went instead to Luton Town for a fee of \u00a312,200 and, when they were relegated, he moved on again to Norwich City."]}, {"page": "Harry Poole", "response": ["Born in Stoke-on-Trent, Poole attended Carmountside Secondary Modern, alongside Terry Miles. Poole was slightly older, though the two would be teammates from their early teens, right into their 30s. After spending his youth with various clubs, Poole signed for Port Vale as an amateur in February 1953. He also appeared for Oxford City whilst on national service.", "He was limited to 29 games in 1963\u201364, but returned to usual service with a 39-game season in 1964\u201365, as the club were relegated into the Fourth Division. He was a vital player for new manager Jackie Mudie in 1965\u201366, playing a total of 51 games. He then posted 34 appearances in 1966\u201367, before playing 35 games for Stanley Matthews in 1967\u201368. He was given a testimonial, shared with Terry Miles, in August 1967. At the end of the campaign both he and Miles were given free transfers to local non-League club Sandbach Ramblers, before Poole retired the following year. In all he made 499 professional appearances for Port Vale (behind only Phil Sproson and Roy Sproson in terms of most appearances for the club), scoring 79 goals."]}, {"page": "Peter Ford (footballer)", "response": ["He played 25 league and six FA Cup games in the 1959\u201360 season.

He missed just five league games in the 1960\u201361 campaign, and was a member of the side that won the Supporters' Clubs' Trophy. He was dropped by manager Norman Low in October 1961, and was used as a utility player in the 1961\u201362 and 1962\u201363 campaigns. He scored his first goal in the Football League on 3 September 1962, in a 4\u20132 win over Colchester United at Vale Park. He also scored goals against Southend United, Reading (2), Shrewsbury Town, and Gillingham, taking his tally to six goals in the 1962\u201363 season. He was released by manager Freddie Steele in the summer of 1963. He finished his career in the Cheshire County League with Macclesfield Town (122 appearances 5 goals) and Stafford Rangers.

Attendances fell away to only 4,605 on 18 September, when Vale 'disgraced themselves' by only beating Lincoln City 3\u20130, who provided 'abysmal opposition'. Keeper Jimmy O'Neill was 'in vintage form', but twelve forwards were tried up front in the first ten games. On 2 October Jackie Mudie's 'extra craft' helped the Vale to thrash high-flying Chester 5\u20132, and two days later Vale beat Crewe Alexandra.

A poor season saw them battle to mid-table in order to avoid the re-election zone. Yet it would be off-the-field developments that would worry Vale supporters the most. An FA/Football League Joint-Inquiry investigated the club as club officials were forced to admit several breaches of the rules in regard to payment of players. The result was expulsion from the League, however before the start of the following season a vote of 39 to 9 allowed the club to be immediately readmitted to the competition. The whole saga was rather ironic, as the club re-entered the League in 1919 after Leeds City were expelled over illegal payments to their players.
