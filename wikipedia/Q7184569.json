He broke several UK gliding records from the 1930s to the 1950s and was involved in UK gliding administration including being Chairman of the British Gliding Association (BGA).\nIn World War II he was second in command of the Air Transport Auxiliary and for this work was appointed CBE.\nAfter the war he was chairman of the BGA for 19 years, and in 1952 he was Open Class World Champion in the world gliding championships in Spain. In 1964 he was awarded the Lilienthal Gliding Medal of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale (FAI) for services to gliding. He was a member of the British Gliding Team until 1958.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World Gliding Championships", "response": ["|  Philip Wills"]}, {"page": "List of glider pilots", "response": ["* Philip Wills - world champion and administrator"]}, {"page": "Ann Welch", "response": ["For many years she and Philip Wills administered British gliding until the members felt that a change was needed. Conscious of the increasing cost of gliding and the need to involve young people, she moved away from gliding and became closely involved in the development of hang gliding and paragliding, and was founder President of the FAI's Hang Gliding Commission and its Paragliding Commission, and was a member of the FAI's Microlight Commission. She became president of the British Hang Gliding Association and when in 1991, the hang-gliders and paragliders joined forces, Welch was appointed president of the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association. In 1978 she was appointed the president of the British Microlight Aircraft Association, a position she held until her death, working actively for the association including attending as a member of their governing council."]}, {"page": "Paul Blanchard", "response": ["In 1955, a printed version of the manual appeared, published by Thermal Equipment Ltd, and since 1958 subsequent editions have been published by the BGA, all under the original author's name.

In 1933, Slingsby started producing RFD Daglings, as the Type 3. The initial wave of interest in gliding in Britain tailed off  and by 1932 Scarborough Gliding Club was in financial trouble. It merged with another club, and further mergers produced the Yorkshire Gliding Club, based at Sutton Bank, near Thirsk. Philip Wills and Fred Slingsby negotiated the lease of the land at Sutton Bank."]}, {"page": "Slingsby King Kite", "response": ["Flight tests of the King Kite with Philip Wills at the controls revealed a tendency to enter spins easily, and more importantly, a reluctance to recover from spins. To alleviate the problem while a permanent solution was found the rudder was increased in size twice, initially in span and later in chord."]}, {"page": "Buxton Hjordis", "response": ["The Buxton Hjordis was a single-seat sailplane built by Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd. in the UK to a design by G.M Buxton.

It operated at Odiham Airfield but after two accidents, the Commandant of Sandhurst ordered it to suspend operations. In early 1951 he ordered Major Deane-Drummond to restart the club at Lasham. In the meantime, the Surrey Gliding Club and Imperial College Gliding Club were both seeking a new home, because Redhill Aerodrome had many other users. The Surrey club and Imperial College therefore moved to Lasham in August 1951. As well as Tony Deane-Drummond, other notable instructors at that time included Ann Welch, Lorne Welch and Philip Wills. All of them went on to become British champions. A war-surplus barrage balloon winch was used for launches. Types flown included Slingsby T.21B trainer, Grunau Baby, and various other pre-war German sailplanes."]}, {"page": "Lilienthal Gliding Medal", "response": ["|  Philip Wills"]}, {"page": "RRG Professor", "response": ["Plans for the Professor were widely sold to commercial manufacturers and to clubs both in Germany and abroad, though the total number of Professors built, sometimes with small variations, is not known.  One at least, constructed in Germany, came to the UK and was flown by Philip Wills. Two were built in the United States as Heller Hawks.  Like other high performance gliders of it day, it was slow to come out of turns and with its strongly tapered wing, prone to tip stalling.  The Professor II, first flown in 1929, addressed some of these problems by increasing the mean overall wing chord with fuller, curved ailerons, modifications first applied to the prototype Rh\u00f6ngeist.  The Professor II also had new horizontal tail with a fixed, swept tailplane mounting constant chord, rounded tip elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire Gliding Club", "response": ["*Philip Wills - competitive glider pilot"]}, {"page": "Gliding Heritage Centre", "response": ["Christopher Wills, the son of Philip Wills, founded the Vintage Glider Club in 1973.
