Okuonghae had another solid season, making 45 appearances in all competitions. In the latter part of the season, Okuonghae struck up a good relationship in the centre of defence with Tom Eastman, at one stage conceding just two goals in six matches. With his contract expiring in the summer, Okuonghae said that rumours linking him with a move away from the club \"helps me to raise my game\" and gives him the confidence to improve his performances."]}]}}
