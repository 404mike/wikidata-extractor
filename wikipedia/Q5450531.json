After this he concentrated on music teaching and concerts. He studied singing in Edinburgh under Finlay Dun, and afterwards in London under Gesualdo Lanza and Domenico Crivelli, taking harmony and counterpoint lessons from George Aspull. In March 1830 he appeared in Edinburgh as Harry Bertram in Guy Mannering, and was subsequently engaged in other operas\u2014notably in Michael William Balfe's, in some of which he created the principal part\u2014at Covent Garden and Drury Lane. His acting was, however, considered stiff, and he abandoned the stage to become an exponent of Scottish song. From 1838 to 1840 he was in America appearing with Jane Shirreff, Edward and Ann Childe Seguin. Wilson appeared before Queen Victoria at Taymouth Castle in 1842."]}, {"page": "Heriot Row", "response": ["* 41 - Finlay Dun, musician"]}]}}
