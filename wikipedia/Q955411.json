Uncounted thousands of Muslim civilians lost their lives in French Army ratissages, bombing raids, or vigilante reprisals. The war uprooted more than 2\u00a0million Algerians, who were forced to relocate in French camps or to flee into the Algerian hinterland, where many thousands died of starvation, disease, and exposure. In addition, large numbers of Harkis were murdered when the FLN settled accounts after independence, with 30,000 to 150,000 killed in Algeria in post-war reprisals.", "In 1977, the British historian Alistair Horne published A Savage War of Peace, which is generally regarded as the leading book written on the subject in English but is written from a French perspective, rather Algerian. After 15 years, Horne was not concerned about right or wrong but cause and effect. A Francophile who lived in Paris at the time of the war, Horne had condemned the Suez Crisis and the French bombing of the Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef in 1958, arguing that the inflexibility of the FLN had won Algeria independence, creating a sense of Algerian national identity and leading it to rule an authoritarian but \"progressive\" FLN regime. The American journalist Adam Shatz wrote: \"Not surprisingly, the best single survey of the war is by an English journalist, Alistair Horne, whose masterful A Savage War of Peace, published in 1977, still has no equal in French.\""]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Alistair Horne (1925\u20132017), modern French"]}, {"page": "Fran\u00e7ois Ravaillac", "response": ["On May 27 he was taken to the Place de Gr\u00e8ve in Paris and was tortured one last time before being  pulled apart by four horses, a method of execution reserved for regicides.

Some have seen this as a mistake, others as evidence that the consultation process was heavily rigged (i.e. that anybody who expressed the slightest willingness to serve under Home as a compromise if necessary was listed as \"supporting\" him). Macmillan's official biographer Alistair Horne believed that Macleod's description of 17 October as \"the key day\" is evidence that he \"changed his mind\", having not previously had a particularly firm opinion. Macmillan's view was \"well, you know \u2026 Macleod was a Highlander!\" Others (e.g. Macmillan's biographer D. R. Thorpe) have suggested that Macleod actually did express a tactical preference for Home, in the hope of bringing about a deadlock in which he would enjoy bargaining power, or perhaps even become Prime Minister himself, and that his subsequent anger was a result of guilt that he had helped to bring about a Home \"victory\"."]}, {"page": "William F.

Buckley was a member of the American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn (ABCDEF) during Flynn's trial for statutory rape in 1943. At Millbrook, Buckley founded and edited the school's yearbook, The Tamarack; this was his first experience in publishing.
