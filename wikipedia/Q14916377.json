He was the first (and so far only) ethnic minority chief constable in the United Kingdom and the first black officer of chief constable-equivalent rank.\nFuller took up his role as Chief Constable of Kent on 5 January 2004. He joined the Metropolitan Police in 1975 as a cadet aged 16 and served in uniformed and CID positions throughout London. His service has included several postings at New Scotland Yard, including selection for Special Branch.\nWhilst a detective chief inspector stationed at Shepherd's Bush and Hammersmith, he devised an innovative burglary control programme which successfully reduced burglary. This was a forerunner to the London-wide Operation Bumblebee. As DCI at Paddington he devised innovative covert techniques to successfully reduce street robbery under the Operation Eagle Eye initiative.\nAs a detective superintendent he worked as a specialist staff officer seconded to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary based at the Home Office. He gave specialist advice on crime and terrorism issues and carried out inspections of police force Special Branches in relation to counter-terrorism. He also gave regular advice to the Chief HMI, Ministers and the Home Secretary.\nIn 1998, he helped set up the Racial and Violent Crime Task Force in response to criticism of the Metropolitan Police arising from the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry. He subsequently served as a uniformed superintendent in Lambeth and was the chief superintendent in charge of Battersea, where he was successful in reducing street crime.\nIn January 2000, as a commander, he took command of West Area Serious Crime Group. As well as overseeing murder investigations, he set up Operation Trident to tackle gun crime within black communities in London.\nIn 2001, he won the G2 \u2018Man of the Year Award\u2019 in recognition of his personal achievements and contribution to policing in London. In February 2002, he was promoted to deputy assistant commissioner. As well as heading the Metropolitan Police Drugs Directorate, he was also the Director of Intelligence, as part of a newly formed Specialist Crime Directorate.On 16 February 2010, it was announced that Fuller would be leaving Kent Police to start his new role as Chief Inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.He retired from the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate in 2015 at the end of his 5-year appointment.

The estate now has a well-known musical tradition and many current rappers, producers and drill artists hail from the estates. Michael Fuller also described being taken aback by the impressive musical band (the Melodians Steel Orchestra UK) that hailed from the estate in the late 1990s, which he described as having a positive social impact on the estate and tried to encourage by directing municipal funding towards them. He drew attention to the band's international success under his patronage, including performing at the Royal Albert Hall 15 years in a row, winning the Royal Anniversary Challenge Award in 1992 and perhaps echoing the success of their later and slightly better-known counterparts. Sound Minds, a musical charity that attempts to alleviate mental health problems, also operates on the Estates at York Road.", "Like many areas of the UK in the 1980s, there were severe issues with poverty after the closure of nearby factories, which was notably apparent within the younger population. Michael Fuller described this era by asserting that \"the buildings may have changed but the people didn't\" and the Winstanley as \"an area of unemployment, extreme poverty and social deprivation\" when recalling his experiences policing the estates in his memoirs. All of the estates are within the top 20% most deprived areas nationally and the worst deprivation (most deprived 10% nationally) is centred around the north of the estates, principally around York Road Estate. The Kinghan Report, commissioned after the London Riots in 2011 for Wandsworth, said that they were one of the five \"most difficult to manage estates in the borough\" and that large parts of the estates were in the bottom 1% of LSOAs on the measure of Income Deprivation Affecting Children."]}, {"page": "Melodians Steel Orchestra UK", "response": ["Although the band did, does and will contain participants throughout the London area and beyond, it does maintain especially strong ties to South London and areas predominantly within the boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth. Michael Fuller, the first Black Chief constable, Commander and Deputy assistant commissioner within the UK, wrote about his encounter with the Melodians by Clapham Junction during his tenure at Battersea Police Station in the late 1990s. He asserted that they had a particularly strong link to the Winstanley and York Road Estates area, as many of the members \"lived on the estate\". The band also practice at Henry Cavendish School in the area of Balham that falls into the London Borough of Lambeth.", "The Melodians have been a registered charity (number 1036904) since 1994, responsible for a wide range of cultural, ambassadorial, educational and social programs to try and benefit a wide involvement of communities. One of the most notable and long-standing partnerships that the band has is with the Henry Cavendish Primary School, where the band has agreed to provide music lessons for the pupils due to practising at the site. Michael Fuller wrote of his admiration for their community outreach work in the Winstanley and York Road Estates in the late 1990s, which inspired him to direct increased municipal funding towards them and convincing him that \"its rising star .... coincided and perhaps contributed something to the area's change\". The Melodians also introduced steelpans to Northern Ireland at Harpurs Hill Junior School in Coleraine and organised for a Catholic and Protestant Junior School to play together at a junior festival in Barbados in October 2000 to encourage unity during the Peace Process. Terry was also awarded the Community Centre and Culture award from the Royal Chartered Borough of Arima in 2008 due to his promotion of steelband participation around the world. However, probably the highest honour that the leader of the group has received was his MBE for services to Music and Community Involvement from the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 2015."]}, {"page": "100 Great Black Britons", "response": ["* Michael Fuller"]}]}}
