Nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause; he believed that there was \"no smoke without fire\" and that the Catholic marchers must have done something to provoke the British Army.Raphael, Amy (30 December 2001). \"The Troubles in Mind\".

Nesbitt played Ivan Cooper in Bloody Sunday, the man who pressed for the march to go ahead. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day.Carton, Donna (4 March 2001). \"Blood Brothers\". Sunday Mirror (MGN): p.\u00a012. He met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised Bloody Sunday Inquiry with them, and also read Don Mullan's Eyewitness Bloody Sunday and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson's Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?. Greengrass compared Nesbitt's preparation to an athlete preparing for a race, and told The Observer, \"For an Irish actor, doing the Troubles is like doing Lear.\" Nesbitt had questioned whether he was a good enough actor to effectively portray Cooper and was worried what Derry Catholics would think of a Protestant playing the lead, although Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant."]}, {"page": "Bloody Sunday (film)", "response": ["The film was inspired by Don Mullan's politically influential book Eyewitness Bloody Sunday (Wolfhound Press, 1997).

The march ended when British Army paratroopers fired on the demonstrators, killing thirteen and wounding another who died four and a half months later.

A number of the military characters were played by ex-members of the British Army, including Simon Mann.

It had been set up in Lurgan in 1972 by part-time Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) sergeant and permanent staff instructor Billy Hanna, who made himself commander of the brigade. His leadership was endorsed by the UVF's leader Gusty Spence. The brigade was described by author Don Mullan as one of the most ruthless units operating in the 1970s. At the time of the attack the Mid-Ulster Brigade was commanded by Robin Jackson, also known as \"The Jackal\". Jackson had assumed command of the Mid-Ulster UVF just a few days before the Miami Showband attack, after allegedly shooting Hanna dead outside his home in Lurgan on 27 July 1975. According to authors Paul Larkin and Martin Dillon, Jackson was accompanied by Harris Boyle when he killed Hanna. Hanna was named by former British Intelligence Corps operative Colin Wallace as having organised and led the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, along with Jackson. Journalist Joe Tiernan suggested that Hanna was shot for refusing to participate in the Miami Showband attack and that he had become an informer for the Garda\u00ed in exchange for immunity from prosecution for the Dublin bombings. Dillon suggested that because there were a number of UDR members in the UVF, and were planned to be used for the Miami Showband ambush, Hanna was considered to have been a \"security risk\", and the UVF decided he had to be killed before he could alert the authorities."]}, {"page": "1956 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*Don Mullan, writer and film producer."]}, {"page": "Raymond McClean", "response": ["* \"Bloody Sunday : the Breglio Report\" Robert J Breglio, Don Mullan, Raymond McClean.
