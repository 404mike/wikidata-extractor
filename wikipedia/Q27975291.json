No British sf magazine appeared until 1934, when Pearson's launched Scoops, a weekly in tabloid format aimed at the juvenile market.  Soon Haydn Dimmock, Scoops' editor, began to receive more sophisticated stories, targeted at an adult audience; he tried to change the magazine's focus to include more mature fiction, but within twenty issues falling sales led Pearson's to cancel the magazine.  The failure of Scoops gave British publishers the impression that Britain could not support a science fiction publication.Ashley (2000), pp.\u00a0127\u2013131."]}, {"page": "Scoops (magazine)", "response": ["Scoops was a weekly British science fiction magazine published by Pearson's in tabloid format in 1934, edited by Haydn Dimmock. Scoops was launched as a boy's paper, and it was not until several issues had appeared that Dimmock discovered there was an adult audience for science fiction.  Circulation was poor, and Dimmock attempted to change the magazine's focus to more mature material.  He reprinted Arthur Conan Doyle's The Poison Belt, improved the cover art, and obtained fiction from British science fiction writers such as John Russell Fearn and Maurice Hugi, but to no avail.  Pearson's cancelled the magazine because of poor sales; the twentieth issue, dated 23 June 1934, was the last. The failure of the magazine contributed to the belief that Britain could not support a science fiction magazine, and it was not until 1937, with Tales of Wonder, that another attempt was made.", "The editor responsible for the new magazine was Haydn Dimmock, the editor of The Scout, and later the originator of \"Bob-a-Job Week\".  Dimmock (who probably did not select the fiction himself) assumed that Scoops' readership would be young, and that no adults would be interested in reading it. His editorial in the first issue declared that Scoops would publish stories that \"look ahead with the vision of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, whose fiction stories of wonder and science, declared impossibilities at the time of publication, are now fact.  Scoops ... will transport its readers from the everyday happenings into the future, with all its exceptions of development and discovery. ... Scoops will endeavour to anticipate the marvels of the age in which we live.\"Ashley (1985), p. 563. It is possible that Dimmock and his staff were aware of American science fiction magazines, which were available in Britain as remainders, sold at stores such as Woolworth's, but if so they did not understand the new genre, instead relying on boys' fiction writers to fill the magazine. Bernard Buley, who worked as the managing editor for Scoops, was one of these, contributing Master of the Moon, which was serialized over the first eleven issues; Buley had been the editor of Boys' Magazine, which had ceased publication in January 1934. Other contributors included George E. Rochester, Stuart Martin, J.H. Stein, and Reginald Thomas, whose The Striding Terror, about a child who grew to fifty feet tall, was serialized in the first eight issues. The stories were initially anonymous, but later research by W.O.G. Lofts has identified most of the authors. The term \"science fiction\" was not used initially; \"science stories\" was how Scoops described its contents, which included stories about scientific inventions and aviation among other subgenres.  Dimmock and Buley asserted that Scoops provided educational scientific content, a claim also made by Hugo Gernsback, who had been involved in launching the science fiction magazine genre in the US, though in the case of Scoops there was very little justification.  Filler material was included with information about inventions and technology, but there was little coverage of scientific topics.", "Scoops was published by C. Arthur Pearson of London. The schedule was weekly; the first issue was dated 10 February 1934, and the run ended on 23 June 1934 with the twentieth issue. Haydn Dimmock was the editor for all of Pearson's juvenile papers, including Scoops, though he was not credited in the magazine.Ashley (2000), p. 126. Bernard Buley was on the editorial staff, taking on the role of the managing editor.Bleiler (1998), p. 584.  Scoops was printed in tabloid format; each issue was 28 pages and was priced at 2d.Ashley (1985), p. 565. The print run was 100,000 copies weekly.  Distribution was weak, and the magazine is now rare and commands high prices."]}, {"page": "Dimmock", "response": ["*Haydn Dimmock"]}, {"page": "1951 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Frederick Haydn Dimmock.

The editor's office of The Scout initially provided a focus for both adults and boys seeking assistance with starting and running a Scout Troop. The advice given was sometimes at variance with Baden-Powell's wishes and he was horrified at Pearson's allocation of places at \"the first official Scout camp\" at Humshaugh, which effectively went to the Scouts who had bought the most copies of the magazine.Jeal, Tim Baden-Powell: Founder of the Boy Scouts, Hutchinson,  (pp. 398-399) In August 1933, falling sales prompted a change of title to Every Boy's Weekly with a reduction of content relating directly to Scouting, in an effort to broaden its appeal. In 1939, Newnes and Pearson decided that it was not profitable to continue publication, so it was taken over by The Boy Scouts Association and reverted to its original title. Haydn Dimmock, who had been editor of The Scout at Pearson's since 1919, was taken onto the Headquarters staff and encouraged to develop the Scouting content. Dimmock resigned as editor in June 1954 shortly before his death and was replaced by Rex Hazlewood.Moynihan 2006, p. 178 Eventually, falling sales led The Boy Scouts Association's Committee of the Council to order the closure of the magazine and it ceased publication with the last issue on 3 September 1966.
