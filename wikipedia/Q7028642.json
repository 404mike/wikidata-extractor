A few days later, the Scottish Football Association charged Randolph with \"violent conduct by kicking an opposing player\" and offered a two-match ban; Motherwell appealed, but the ban was upheld. Together with teammates Shaun Hutchinson, Nicky Law and Michael Higdon, Randolph was named in the 2012\u201313 PFA Scotland Team of the Year.

Hutchinson made his return in a friendly match and then made his Champions League debut against Panathinaikos in the third qualifying round. Motherwell lost 3\u20130 on aggregate to go out of the competition, but entered the Europa League play-off round. During playing against Panathinaikos in both legs, Hutchinson was faulted for committing fouls in dangerous area and was penalised several times. Hutchinson played in the first leg against Spanish side Levante, but was sent off in the 77th minute \"for hauling down Gekas on the edge of the box as he bore down on goal.\" The team were again eliminated after losing in the return leg. Two days later, Hutchinson was sent off for the second time in days after a second bookable offence, as Motherwell drew 1\u20131 with St Mirren. After the match, Manager McCall said the referee giving Hutchinson a second yellow card was wrong and it left him in tears. In the summer transfer window, Hutchinson was linked with a move to the Championship and McCall turned down a bid for him. Hutchinson scored his first goal of the season in a 3\u20133 draw against Aberdeen on 21 September 2012. In a 2\u20130 loss against Rangers in the Scottish Communities League Cup, Hutchinson made a direct clash with Francisco Sandaza, after which both players had blood streaming from their wounds, but Hutchinson returned to the pitch after treatment. Then in a 1\u20130 loss against Hearts on 21 October 2012, Hutchinson injured his hamstring and was later substituted. After the match, Hutchinson would be out for several weeks for his hamstring injury. Hutchinson made his return for the club on 18 November 2012, in a 5\u20131 loss against Inverness CT. Since his return, Hutchinson regained his first team place and said he was aiming for finishing second place. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, together with teammates Darren Randolph, Nicky Law and Michael Higdon, Hutchinson was named in the 2012\u201313 PFA Scotland Team of the Year."]}]}}
