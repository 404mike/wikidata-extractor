Newbould (1861 \u2013 April 1928, born in Liverpool, Lancashire) was an English football player and manager who managed Derby County and Manchester City.\nBefore becoming a manager Newbould combined a job at an iron foundry with playing football, playing as an outside right. Derby St. Luke and Sheffield Wednesday among his clubs. He later trained as an accountant.\nIn 1900 he became the first person to hold the position of manager at Derby County, stepping up from his previous position as assistant secretary. Prior to his appointment the Derby team was selected by committee. Newbould's Derby reached the FA Cup final in 1903, but lost 6\u20130 to Bury at Crystal Palace. In 1906 financial pressures led Derby's directors to sell England international Steve Bloomer to Middlesbrough. Newbould disagreed with the decision, and left the club at the end of the season to take up the managerial position at Manchester City.Newbould joined Manchester City with the club in turmoil. A scandal concerning illegal payments to players had resulted in the suspension of seventeen players, leaving a squad of only eleven players. Newbould was tasked with both rebuilding the team and proving the club's accounts were being run in a lawful manner. Newbould's first match was an encounter with Woolwich Arsenal at Hyde Road. The makeshift side struggled on a hot day, losing three players to sunstroke by half-time. By the end of the match City were down to just six players, the final score 4\u20131 to Arsenal. His second match saw an even heavier defeat, 9\u20131 to Everton, a scoreline which remains a club record defeat more than a century later. Over the course of the season Newbould's City gradually recovered, winning the first top-flight Manchester derby 3\u20130, but only finished two places above the relegation zone. The following season, he guided Manchester City to a third-place finish, but performances were inconsistent, and in the 1908\u201309 season the club were relegated. Newbould remained manager after relegation and led City to the Second Division championship at the first attempt. After two consecutive bottom half Division One finishes, Newbould left the club.\nAfter leaving City he had a brief spell as a coach at Copenhagen's Akademisk Boldklub before becoming secretary of the Players' Union in 1913, a position he held until his death in 1928.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Professional Footballers' Association", "response": [":1913: Harry Newbould"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. managers", "response": ["Under Sam Omerod the club achieved promotion to the First Division for the first time,Manchester City - The Complete Record, p235\u20136 and five years later Tom Maley became the first Manchester City manager to win a major trophy, the 1904 FA Cup. p136 A financial scandal resulted in the Football Association suspending Maley and seventeen players in 1906, p93 leaving Harry Newbould with the task of assembling a makeshift side at short notice. In 1912 Ernest Mangnall joined City from local rivals Manchester United, but was unable to replicate the success he had enjoyed with the Reds. Upon Mangnall's departure in 1924 the roles of secretary and manager were separated, with David Ashworth appointed manager and Wilf Wild as secretary. This arrangement continued during Peter Hodge's time as manager, though the roles merged again when Wild became manager in 1932. Wild became the club's longest serving manager, winning the FA Cup and League Championship during his fourteen-year tenure. By the time Sam Cowan replaced Wild the roles of secretary and manager were separated permanently. Cowan lasted only one season, and was replaced by Jock Thomson. He gained promotion, but did not make a lasting impact at the top level."]}]}}
