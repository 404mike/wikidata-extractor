Berahino joined West Bromwich Albion at the age of 11 and turned professional seven years later. He spent time out on loan at Football League clubs Northampton Town, Brentford and Peterborough United.\nBerahino made his first starts for West Bromwich Albion in the 2013\u201314 season, with highlights of that campaign including a hat-trick against Newport County, and the winning goal at Old Trafford against Manchester United. In his second full season, he recorded 20 goals in 45 matches across all competitions. Following that campaign, Berahino became involved in a lengthy transfer saga involving Tottenham Hotspur, straining his relationships with manager Tony Pulis and chairman Jeremy Peace. He was criticised for his conduct and fell out of favour, scoring only seven goals in the 2015\u201316 season; he did not score a competitive goal from 27 February 2016 to 28 August 2018, a goal drought of 913 days. In January 2017, he joined Stoke City for a fee of \u00a312 million, potentially rising to \u00a315 million. Stoke were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2017\u201318 season and after a single season in the EFL Championship, Berahino was released by Stoke with three years left on his contract.\nBerahino represented England at all youth levels from under-16 to under-21, and was part of their under-17 team which won the 2010 European Championship. He was called up for the first time to the senior team in November 2014 but did not play. He switched his international allegiance to Burundi in August 2018 and scored on his international debut in September, later captaining the team at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tutsi", "response": ["* Saido Berahino"]}, {"page": "Gareth Southgate", "response": ["After four years out of football, Southgate returned to management after he signed a three-year contract to succeed Stuart Pearce as the manager of the England under-21 team on 22 August 2013.
