Some of Poulson's largest residential blocks were built in Cunningham's home town of Felling, County Durham. Cunningham later went to prison for his dealings with the architect.  Poulson's work in Felling consisted of the building of one 16-storey high-rise apartment block with six seven-storey blocks of maisonettes surrounding.  These were approved in 1966.  Four of the low-rise maisonette blocks were demolished in 1987 owing to their poor state of repair and unpopularity with tenants.  Two maisonette blocks and the high-rise block Crowhall Tower remain."]}, {"page": "Eddie Milne", "response": ["During his Parliamentary career, Milne became increasingly concerned about problems of endemic corruption within local government in the north east of England.
