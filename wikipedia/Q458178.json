Spilsbury informed him that those who died in an air crash often did so from shock and not drowning; the lungs would not necessarily be filled with water. He added that \"Spaniards, as Roman Catholics, were averse to post-mortems and did not hold them unless the cause of death was of great importance\".

Goldschmidt and Rosbaud were friends and when the persecution of Jews in Germany intensified in 1935, Rosbaud helped Goldschmidt abandon G\u00f6ttingen and return to Oslo. In late autumn 1939 Rosbaud again visited Oslo and urged Hassel to warn Norwegian authorities about a likely German invasion of Norway.Kramish, Arnold (1987).
