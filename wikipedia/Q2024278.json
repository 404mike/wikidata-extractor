The tour marked his first association with new drummer Tony Fernandez who would perform on many of Wakeman's future albums and tours. During its stop in Rio de Janeiro, Wakeman met Ronnie Biggs, one of those involved in the 1963 Great Train Robbery. The two went drinking, played football, and exchanged a gift of shirts, including one that Biggs allegedly wore during the robbery. In late 1975, Wakeman composed the soundtrack for Lisztomania, a biography film about composer Franz Liszt written and directed by Ken Russell. Wakeman appears in the film as Thor, the god of thunder. A few years later, he recalled the album in a more negative light as \"there was hardly anything of mine on it in the end\", and criticised its mixing and production.Wooding 1979, p. 147."]}, {"page": "Phantom Power (Rick Wakeman album)", "response": ["*Tony Fernandez - drums, percussion"]}, {"page": "Strawbs", "response": ["Signed to the Deep Purple-owned Oyster label, they recorded two more albums with two keyboardists replacing Hawken \u2013 Robert Kirby, also known for his string arrangements (notably Nick Drake) and John Mealing of jazz-rock group If.
