Lord Hawke's English team, including several English Test players, toured around the same time, playing Trinidad, Barbados and British Guiana (now Guyana). Then in 1900 the white Trinidadian Aucher Warner, the brother of future England captain Pelham Warner, led a touring side to England, but none of the matches on this tour were given first-class status. Two winters later, in 1901\u201302, the Hampshire wicketkeeper Richard Bennett's XI went to the West Indies, and played three games against teams styled as the \"West Indies\", which the hosts won 2\u20131. In 1904\u201305, Lord Brackley's XI toured the Caribbean \u2013 winning both its games against \"West Indies\"."]}, {"page": "Archie MacLaren", "response": ["A combination of injuries and work reduced the amount of cricket MacLaren played after 1905.Down (1981), p. 112. He missed most of Lancashire's matches in June and July 1906. He returned against Middlesex at Lord's in August, but was involved in mild controversy when he declined to put Middlesex's batsmen under pressure when chasing a small but challenging total to win the game; this may have arisen from his dislike of Lord's and the figures in authority there.Down (1981), pp. 113\u201314. MacLaren ended the 1906 season with 599 runs at 20.65. In the winter of 1906\u201307, MacLaren returned to India to work for Ranjitsinhji. In January 1907, he wrote to Lancashire to inform them of his reduced availability for 1907; even so, the committee retained him as captain.Down (1981), p. 114. In February, Ranjitsinhji was named as the new ruler of Nawanagar.Wilde, p. 172. MacLaren attended his installation on 11 March\u2014MacLaren and the politician Arthur Priestley were the only English attendeesWilde, pp. 173, 176.\u2014and did not return to England until mid-June, although he informed Lancashire that his absence in India was to recover from an illness. He resumed the captaincy of Lancashire, and made a good start with scores of 47 and 92 in his second match, but his form faded. One match provoked a public row between MacLaren and Lord's. MacLaren captained Lancashire against Middlesex at Lord's in July; rain restricted play on the first day of the three-day game, and at the start of the second day, the umpires ruled that the waterlogged pitch remained unfit to play on. Some spectators came on to the pitch to look for themselves, then protested outside the pavilion. The incident was defused by the ground authorities, but the following day MacLaren told the press: \"Owing to the pitch having been deliberately torn up by the public, I, as captain of the Lancashire eleven, cannot see my way to continue the game, the groundsman bearing me out that the wicket [pitch] could not be again put right.\"Down (1981), p. 115. Lancashire would not play\u2014although all decisions about fitness for play should have been made by the umpires, not MacLaren\u2014and the match was drawn. The incident provoked discussion in the press, but most critics agreed that MacLaren was in the wrong. MacLaren subsequently scored his first century for two years, but he did little in the remainder of the season, at the end of which he again resigned the captaincy of Lancashire, conscious of his failing form and fitness.Down (1981), p. 116. In all first-class cricket in 1907, he scored 829 runs at 26.74."]}, {"page": "Queen's Park Oval", "response": ["The Queen's Park Oval Cricket Club leased the Queen's Park Oval in 1896, moving there from its first home at the Queen's Park Savannah, where it had existed since its founding in 1891. The natural soil at the ground prevented turf wickets from being laid down, due to the damage caused by the mole crickets that inhabited it, so when the club moved to its new ground the groundsmen laid a pitch of clay with a wicket made of matting prepared on top. A popular venue due to its capacity (7,000 when first constructed, the highest in the Caribbean) the ground was very profitable for the owning cricket club. The first match recorded by CricketArchive, CricInfo and Wisden took place on 29 January 1897, between Lord Hawke's touring party and a team put out by the Queen's Park Oval Club. The match, which was a draw but saw the ground's first century\u2014119 by Plum Warner\u2014was not counted as first-class. Only a few days later on February 1 the ground's maiden first-class fixture took place between Trinidad and the same Lord Hawke's XI. The home team won by 137 runs. The two teams met at the Oval again on 5 February, when Trinidad were victorious once more. Arthur Priestley's touring eleven then played a Queen's Park XI on February 12, with the game drawn."]}, {"page": "Barbados national cricket team", "response": ["In January 1888, Barbados played their first match against a team that was not another British colony in the West Indies, appearing in a fixture against an amateur team representing the United States.Other matches played by Barbados  \u2013 CricketArchive.
