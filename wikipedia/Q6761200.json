She had already made her fortune as a singer, a dancer (of some repute) and an actor. Together with her business partner, Maria Foote, and later with her husband, the actor Charles James Mathews,  who joined the company in 1835, Madame Vestris initiated several theatrical innovations, such as the use of historically correct costumes and more elaborate scenery, including a box set with ceiling, which she is said to have introduced in Britain. Her stewardship began with a programme of four pieces including Olympic Revels,Theatre Museum (PeoplePlay), accessed 23 March 2007. and under her management the theatre continued to feature light comedies including music, which were legally styled burlettas and whose licence she had been granted by the Lord Chamberlain.Bratton, Jacky. \"Vestris, Lucia Elizabeth (1797\u20131856)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 12 March 2014  Many were written by J.
