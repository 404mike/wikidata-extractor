Despite this, all characters onscreen act as though the rules are clear and obvious. The game goes through several rounds with varying formats, until the final round, titled \"Wangernumb\".

The game is almost consistently won by Simon with the prizes including an oversized cheque originally intended for Children in Need or a knighthood, while the losing contestant suffers varying indignities such as being stuffed into a cardboard box or arrested by the police.
