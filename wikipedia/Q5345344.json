He did his research from 1960 until 1984 at the Building Research Establishment. Among his research projects was developing a new type of tendering for construction projects called operational bills. He also started the study of the actual amount of waste in the construction industry, and investigated the varying methods of cost estimation practices used in different countries. His contributions are still widely discussed in the academic literature particularly upon operational bills, and building waste", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London South Bank University", "response": ["* Edward Skoyles"]}, {"page": "Abbots Langley", "response": ["*Edward Skoyles (1923\u20132008) researcher and quantity surveyor."]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Harrow", "response": ["* Edward Skoyles, researcher and quantity surveyor, born in Harrow"]}, {"page": "Operational bill", "response": ["Operational bills were proposed and developed by Edward Skoyles  at Building Research Establishment in the 1960s.
