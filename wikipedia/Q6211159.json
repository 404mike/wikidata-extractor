The pair were signed by Stoke City in January 1928. Liddle was a small, tricky, right winger and became a very likeable person both on and off the pitch. He scored on his debut in a 5\u20131 win over Nottingham Forest on the opening day of the 1928\u201329 season however he did not fully establish himself in Tom Mather's side until the next campaign. He was able to play in all forward positions and was more than capable of using both feet. This two footed ability saw Liddle play out of position as he played most of 1929\u201330 and 1930\u201331 at inside left. He scored a career best of 15 in 1930\u201331 as he finished joined top scorer with Wilf Kirkham. The emergence of Mawson and Tommy Sale as natural goalscorers in 1931\u201332 gave Liddle his right wing position back and targets for which to aim his crosses which worked well as Stoke gained promotion in 1932\u201333."]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Joe Mawson"]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Joe Mawson"]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["The 1931\u201332 season proved to be an entertaining season for Stoke as they were involved in the hunt for promotion throughout the campaign, just missing out in third spot in the final placings.

There were a number of good things to come out of the season, including 25 goals from Joe Mawson and a 14 match unbeaten run from mid-November to the beginning of February.
