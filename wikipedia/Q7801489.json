He moved from Clyde 1 to Clyde 2 at the start of 2008. He presented his last show on Radio Clyde on Saturday 8 May 2010 on Clyde 2, which featured friends and colleagues paying tribute to him.\nStevens was born on 4 February 1952 and was brought up in Easterhouse, a housing scheme in Glasgow.  At the age of 17 he started disc jockeying at The Electric Garden nightclub in Sauchiehall Street. Stevens was recruited to Radio Clyde in 1974 and has remained a regular broadcaster there, with a temporary stint at West Sound in the 1980s.  Stevens' first show on Radio Clyde, that was broadcast on Monday evenings between 8 pm and 10 pm in the mid-1970s - was entitled The Aff Its Heid Show (Aff Its Heid = Off Its Head in Standard English).\nStevens left Radio Clyde in May 1975 to try his hand at being a pop star (he had released a number of songs which he would play on his own show with his band called the Aff Its Heid Band, a group of young Glasgow musicians), but he would return to the Clyde airwaves shortly afterwards.\nIn 1987 Stevens was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but continued to work in radio despite the steady progression of the disease.  In March 2010 a benefit night was held to raise funds for treatment for Stevens.  Stevens then travelled to Katowice, Poland for a new experimental treatment of Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency.  Stevens reported initial results as promising.In the early 1990s Stevens made the public announcements for Scottish football club Celtic during games at Celtic Park.
