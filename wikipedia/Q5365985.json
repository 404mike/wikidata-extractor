He was mistakenly described as a spin bowler in the Wisden match report.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1950, p. 595. Opening the bowling in both innings with Brian Close, who was medium pace, Trueman took two for 72 and one for 22 as Cambridge were dismissed for 283 and 196 respectively. Yorkshire scored 317 for six declared and 164 for one so Trueman, who was number 11 in the order, did not bat. Trueman's first wicket was that of opening batsman Robert Morris, who was caught by Ellis Robinson for 19. In the second innings, Trueman bowled the future Sussex and England batsman Hubert Doggart for 23. Three other debutants that day who all became England players were Close and opening batsman Frank Lowson for Yorkshire; and Middlesex fast bowler John Warr for Cambridge. Many years later, Warr wrote the biographical piece about Trueman in Barclays World of Cricket.Warr, Barclays, p. 239. Trueman had match figures of six for 72 in his second match against Oxford, which Yorkshire lost by 69 runs. A month later, he took eight for 70 against the Minor Counties on his first appearance at Lord's, bowling unchanged through the second innings.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1950, p. 270. Commenting on his first County Championship match, against Surrey at Park Avenue, Bradford, Wisden said that he bowled \"fast and with effect\".Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1950, p. 582.", "The great Yorkshire team of the 1930s had been broken up by the Second World War and a rebuilding phase was underway by the late 1940s, although Yorkshire had won the first post-war County Championship in 1946. Norman Yardley succeeded Brian Sellers as captain in 1948 and his main team members that season were Len Hutton, Ted Lester, Harry Halliday, Vic Wilson, Willie Watson, Frank Smailes, Johnny Wardle, Don Brennan (wicket-keeper), Ellis Robinson, Ron Aspinall and Alex Coxon. Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.Arlott, p. 25.", "Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship, twenty points adrift of the joint winners Lancashire and Surrey.Webber, pp. 83\u201384. For the most part, Yorkshire selected from fifteen players in 1950 although a few others made occasional appearances. Yardley captained the team in which Hutton and Lowson were the established openers although, with Hutton's Test calls, there were more opportunities for Halliday and Geoffrey Keighley. Lester, Watson, Wilson and Billy Sutcliffe were the other batsmen and Brennan was the wicket-keeper. The main bowlers were Wardle, Coxon and Eddie Leadbeater. Brian Close was doing his national service and could only make a single appearance, Ellis Robinson had departed and Ron Aspinall's career had been wrecked by his injury. So Trueman and Whitehead, who made 13 appearances, contested the fourth bowling place but one of the bit players was Bob Appleyard, who would make a major impact in 1951."]}, {"page": "George Macaulay", "response": ["Macaulay's final two seasons were affected by injury, as he was increasingly bothered by rheumatism.Hodgson, p. 138. In the 1934 season, while trying to take a catch, he injured the finger he used to spin the ball. He did not appear for Yorkshire until June, but went on to take 55 wickets at an average of 23.43. The next season was his final one. He only played nine matches, taking 22 wickets at 20.09. At the end of the year, he retired from first-class cricket and Yorkshire awarded him a special grant of \u00a3250. Yorkshire did have a replacement in mind; Frank Smailes was considered to be versatile enough in his bowling style to take Macaulay's place, but it was not until Ellis Robinson secured a place in 1937 that a new specialist off-spinner was found.Hodgson, p. 145."]}, {"page": "1939 English cricket season", "response": ["Yorkshire were captained by Brian Sellers, whose efforts earned him a place in Wisdens \"Five Cricketers of the Year\".

The bowling depended on Hedley Verity (165 wickets), Ellis Robinson (102), Bill Bowes (96) and Frank Smailes (49).  The wicket-keeper was Arthur Wood who completed 39 catches and 27 stumpings.

Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall.

He set the county records for stumpings in a season, in 1949, and for catches in a season, in 1963, as well as for the most dismissals in a season. He also set the county record for the number of career dismissals, was the first to make six dismissals in an innings, and equalled the county record of nine dismissals in a match."]}, {"page": "Stuart Rogers", "response": ["Rogers' second season as Somerset captain, 1951, was more difficult than the first. The side was dependent for wickets on a trio of spin bowlers, Johnny Lawrence, Ellis Robinson and Horace Hazell, with the last two both past 40. In 1950, runs had come from several team members: in 1951, Maurice Tremlett made more than 2,000 and Harold Gimblett 1,400, but no one else apart from a couple of irregular amateurs averaged more than 20. Rogers made only 784 runs in Championship games with a top score of 58, although his season average and total was improved by an unbeaten 107 in 160 minutes against the South African touring team. This was to prove his highest score in first-class cricket. With both batting and bowling inadequacies, Somerset fell back to 14th in the Championship, with only five victories and 15 defeats."]}, {"page": "Jim Redman (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1951, he played in all but the first of Somerset's County Championship matches \u2013 he appeared in 27 games \u2013 and was awarded his county cap. He took 50 wickets in all at the relatively high average of 33.76. After the third Championship match, Maurice Tremlett, who had taken eight wickets to that point, did not bowl again during the season, and Redman opened the bowling in every other game with Bertie Buse, also barely above medium pace; they were backed by the three spin bowlers, Ellis Robinson, Johnny Lawrence and Horace Hazell, and these five bowlers then took all of Somerset's wickets for Championship matches across the whole summer. Redman had limited numbers of successful days: against Nottinghamshire at Yeovil he took five wickets for 151 runs after Tremlett had withdrawn from the attack. But his best performance was a month later at Frome: in the Derbyshire first innings, bowling unchanged with Buse, Redman took seven wickets for 23 runs as Derbyshire were dismissed for just 52 in an hour and 45 minutes. This return, from what Wisden termed \"deadly swing bowling by Redman\", was the best of his first-class career. In addition to his bowling, Redman also batted usefully in the lower order in 1951, making 472 runs at an average of 13.88. His highest score of the season, and the highest of his career, was 45 against Essex at Brentwood."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Ellis Robinson"]}, {"page": "George Robinson (cricketer, born 1873)", "response": ["His nephew Ellis Robinson played first-class cricket for Yorkshire and Somerset."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset first-class cricket records", "response": ["|| 15/78 || Ellis Robinson || Sussex || Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare || 1951"]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1933\u20131939)", "response": ["The end of Sutcliffe's Test career meant that, from then on, he was always available for Yorkshire, who regained the County Championship title in 1935.  Verity and Bowes, well supported by Smailes, were again the key bowlers.  George Macaulay played his final season and there were two newcomers in Paul Gibb and Ellis Robinson.  Sutcliffe scored 1,966 runs in the championship and was easily the county's outstanding batsman.  Barber, who had a fine season, Mitchell and the wicket-keeper Arthur Wood were the only others to exceed 1,000 runs.  Despite being in the champion team, Yorkshire's batsmen scored only 15 centuries in 30 matches: Barber scored 4 and Wood, Gibb and Hutton scored 1 each.

Other good scores were achieved by Barber, Leyland, Mitchell, Turner, Sellers, Wood and Yardley.  Frank Smailes was a very useful all-rounder and Ellis Robinson was successful with his off spin but Verity was again the outstanding bowler.  Bowes missed several championship matches but still averaged about four wickets per game."]}, {"page": "James Wheeler (cricketer)", "response": ["Wheeler made his debut in county cricket for Wiltshire in the 1932 Minor Counties Championship against the Surrey Second XI.

Following the war, he played Minor counties cricket for Wiltshire from 1947 to 1955, making an additional making 43 further appearances, the last of which came against the Kent Second XI.

Maurice Leyland was another regular England batsman and Yorkshire could also rely on Wilf Barber, Arthur Mitchell and Edgar Oldroyd. Opposing batsmen always knew that they would face a formidable attack, not least the two all-time greats Wilfred Rhodes through the 1920s and his successor Hedley Verity in the thirties. Yorkshire also called upon England bowlers George Macaulay, Roy Kilner, Abe Waddington, Bill Bowes and Frank Smailes. The redoubtable Emmott Robinson was a good bowler too, as was his namesake Ellis Robinson (no relation) in the late 1930s. Yorkshire's main wicket-keepers were Arthur Dolphin, who had made his debut in 1905, and Arthur Wood; they both played for England."]}]}}
