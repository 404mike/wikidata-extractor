In a personal triumph for John Wheatley, Minister for Health, a Housing Act was passed, which greatly expanded municipal housing for low paid workers.Morgan, Kevin.

The ILP provided many of the new Labour MPs, including John Wheatley, Emanuel Shinwell, Tom Johnston and David Kirkwood. However, the first Labour government, returned to office in 1924, proved to be hugely disappointing to the ILP.  This came despite 30% of the cabinet holding ILP membership; of the most prominent of these figures, Ramsay MacDonald was removed as editor of the ILP's Socialist Review in 1925, and Philip Snowden resigned from the ILP in 1927."]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for Health and Social Care", "response": ["| John Wheatley"]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* John Wheatley, MP 1922\u201330, Minister of Health 1924.", "** John Wheatley, Baron Wheatley, MP 1947\u201354, Solicitor General for Scotland 1947, Lord Advocate 1947\u201351, Labour Life Peer.
