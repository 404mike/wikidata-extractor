In September of the same year, George returned to 20th Century Boy, this time performing at Belgrade Theatre in Coventry. Early 2013 saw Maguire appear in a production called Lift, where he played a Busker, looking for cash and for the woman that always walks past him smiling every morning. Maguire said about the production: \"I have always been passionate about new writing and love the chance to originate a role.\" Maguire then played Dave Davies in the Kinks musical, Sunny Afternoon, on which he commented: \"It's quite rare and special to be able to see a piece through from the beginning.\" The show opened at the Hampstead Theatre in April 2014 and after a sold-out run of 6 weeks, transferred to the West End's Harold Pinter Theatre where it ran for two years.
