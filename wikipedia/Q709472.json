Although Haigh's observation participates in a revisionist agenda that does not acknowledge what else he brought to the construction, Dickens' dependence on Foxe's text is indisputable.  Why should that dependency be so worthy of comment? Dickens wrote a history that was informed by facts and\u2014similarly to Milton\u2014also the substance of his text, derived directly from Foxe's Acts and Monuments. Foxe's historical vision and the documentation to support it, was taught to young Arthur Dickens, along with his fellows, as a schoolboy."]}]}}
