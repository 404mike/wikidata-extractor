Crumley was ever-present as Darlington won the division and consequent promotion to the Second Division. Although the record-breaking goalscoring of Davie Brown attracted most attention, Crumley's contribution to his club's success was generally appreciated. A profile in the Derby Daily Telegraph at the start of the new season described him as \"not as tall as some goalkeepers, but his sense of anticipation is highly developed, while his judgment is good, hands safe, and his clearances pronounced.\" Performances such as that in a draw with Chelsea in October 1925, when \"practically every report of the match, in which two goals were divided, declared Crumley as one of the best on the field\", led to speculation about his possible selection for the Scotland national team, yet two weeks after the Chelsea match, after 55 consecutive first-team appearances, he was dropped to the reserves in favour of John Maughan. The two shared goalkeeping duties for the remainder of the season, Crumley making 24 league appearances. He was not included on Darlington's retained list, and signed for Third Division South club Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic."]}]}}
