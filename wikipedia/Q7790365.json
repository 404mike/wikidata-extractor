A right-hand batsman, he made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1906 season in August against Hampshire but made little impact. However, in his second match, against Warwickshire, he scored 68 in the first innings and 45 in the second. His scores in his remaining four games in the season were more modest. He played four games in the 1907 season, and only in the first did he score in double figures.\nHallam emigrated to New Zealand in 1920. In 1921 he played two games for Wairarapa in the Hawke Cup. From 1923 to 1948 he was the groundsman at Lancaster Park, the Test ground in Christchurch. He died in Christchurch at the age of 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1906", "response": ["Reginald Rickman, a future captain, made his debut and also Henry Purdy and Frederick Bracey who played several seasons.
