Since then, continuing scholarship\u2014such as that by Stirling, who calls Bloch a visionary, although a \"flawed\" one\u2014has been more critically objective of Bloch's recognisable weaknesses. For example, although he was a keen advocate for chronological precision and textual accuracy, his only major work in this area, a discussion of Osbert of Clare's Life of Edward the Confessor, was subsequently \"seriously criticised\" by later experts in the field such as R. W. Southern and Frank Barlow; Epstein later suggested Bloch was \"a mediocre theoretician but an adept artisan of method\". Colleagues who worked with him occasionally complained that Bloch's manner could be \"cold, distant, and both timid and hypocritical\" due to the strong views he had held on the failure of the French education system. Bloch's reduction of the role of individuals, and their personal beliefs, in changing society or making history has been challenged. Even Febvre, reviewing Feudal Society on its post-war publication, suggested that Bloch had unnecessarily ignored the individual's role in societal development."]}, {"page": "Wilfrid", "response": ["The historian Peter Hunter Blair summarises Wilfrid's life as follows: \"Wilfrid left a distinctive mark on the character of the English church in the seventh century.

However, the establishment of the civil order upheld by integralists is generally thought of as beginning with the conversion of Roman Emperor Constantine I in 312. While Constantine personally embraced Christianity, it was only in 380 that Theodosius I formally adopted Catholicism as the religion of the empire by the Edict of Thessalonica. What R. W. Southern called the identification of the Church with the whole of organised societyWestern Society and the Church in the Middle Ages. p. 16. was intensified by the legal reforms of Justinian in the 6th century. The climactic stage in the identification began in the Latin West with the papal transference of Translatio imperii to Charlemagne in 800. The Constantinian age began to decline with the Reformation and is generally treated as ending with the French Revolution. In 1950, Pius XII identified the Dominican friar and prophet Savonarola as an early pioneer of integralism in the face of the \"neo-pagan\" influences of the Renaissance: \"Savonarola shows us the strong conscience of the ascetic and an apostle who has a lively sense of things divine and eternal, who takes a stand against rampant paganism, who remains faithful to the evangelical and Pauline ideal of integral Christianity, put into action in public life as well and animating all institutions. This is why he started preaching, prompted by an interior voice and inspired by God.\"\"Savonarola si rivela una forte coscienza di asceta e di apostolo che ha vivo il senso del divino e dell\u2019eterno, che si rivolta contro il paganesimo dilagante, che resta fedele all\u2019ideale evangelico e paolino di un Cristianesimo integrale, attuato anche nella vita pubblica e animante tutte le istituzioni.

He was given 30 days to comply.Stubbs, p.101-2 R. W. Southern alleges that Peter made a last, personal appeal to his old teacher while riding from Verona to Ferrara, and that the Pope was so incensed by the attempt to circumvent legal procedure that he died the following day of a heart attack. Kingsford's account is much less dramatic, without the foreshortened time scheme. The Pope's letter from Ferrara seems to have preceded his death by some weeks: he died on 19 October and was buried on the 20th, while Pope Gregory VIII was elected on 21 October, as Honorius reported to his monks.Stubbs, p.106 Peter's own later account of Urban's death has him taken ill while changing horses, shortly after Peter had approached him, but also mentions he contracted dysentery on the journey from VeronaStubbs, p.556 \u2013 an entirely plausible cause of death.

His premise is that when sodomy was not being explicitly and \"officially\" denounced, it was therefore being \"tolerated\".  Historian R. W. Southern disagreed with Boswell's claims and wrote in 1990 that \"the only relevant generalization which emerges from the penitential codes down to the eleventh century is that sodomy was treated on about the same level as copulation with animals.\"  Southern further notes that \"Boswell thinks that the omission of sodomy from the stringent new code of clerical celibacy issued by the Roman Council of 1059 implies a degree of tolerance.  Countering this is the argument that the Council of 1059 had more urgent business on hand; and in any case, sodomy had been condemned by Leo IX at Rheims in 1049.\"R. W. Southern, Saint Anselm: A Portrait in a Landscape (Cambridge, 1990), pp. 149\u2013150.

Payer, Sex and the Penitentials (Toronto, 1984), pp. 135\u2013139 and passim.
