Willson outlined a wide-ranging number of objectives for the Society, mentioning that it should follow the example of a Topographical Society recently formed in Wiltshire, presumably by his friend John Britton. In 1843 there were 69 members of society many of whom were of considerable note, including the mathematicians George Boole and Sir Edward Bromhead. Other local architects were well represented including William Adams Nicholson, Henry Goddard, James Sandby Padley and John Langwith of Grantham. However, either in 1844 or 1845 the Society  faded out, but it was a precursor to the Lincolnshire Diocesan Architectural Society, which moved to Lincoln in 1856, and from which the Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology is directly descended."]}, {"page": "An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism", "response": ["In 1828, Green published the paper which is the essay he is most famous for today.

While George Boole was largely self taught, he was also encouraged and lent books by Sir Edward Bromhead, chairman of the Mechanics' Institute and a notable mathematician. At the time he was recognised by the Institute as youthful prodigy. In April 1835 when the Mechanics' Institute was presented a bust of Sir Isaac Newton by the Earl of Yarborough he gave a lecture to the Mechanics' Institute on Newton and The hope expressed by the excellent President Sir Edw. Ffrench Bromhead, at the close of the lecture, said that Mr. G. Boole would go on in the course he had commenced, and one day be an honor to Lincoln, was we believe echoed by every breast We trust that many youths present would also feel the spring of laudable ambition touched within them, while listening to honourable testimonies and encomiums thus given to genius and industry. The noble Patron (Earl of Yarborough) also gave a handsome testimony to the powers of the youthful lecturer.Stamford Mercury, Friday 13 February 1835, p4, col 4."]}]}}
