This was confirmed to be allowed in 2014 after a two-year campaign by a local newspaper, the Sutton Coldfield Observer, Andrew Mitchell MP, the Sutton Coldfield Civic Society and various local residents. On Thursday, 12 June 2014 government minister Greg Clark confirmed during a special adjournment debate in the House of Commons that \"there is no statutory ban to the continuance of historic titles for other [non-governance] purposes\" in the absence of a local governing structure using a historic name, and thus the use of the Royal title is not prohibited (although any such usage has a \"lack of technical legal effect\").
