She was the heiress of her father, and became the Countess of Buckinghamshire by marriage in 1793. Her lifestyle and size made her the subject and victim of cartoons by James Gillray and others; she figures in over 50 satirical prints.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rout", "response": ["In Georgian England a \"rout\" or rout-party was a relatively informal party given by the well-off, to which large numbers of people were invited. The term covered a variety of styles of event, but they tended to be basic, and a guest could not count on any music, food, drink, cards, and dancing being available, though any of these might be.  \"Rout-cake\" was a particular type, mentioned by Jane Austen in Emma. Rout Cakes Often all there was to do was talk.  James Gillray's caricature of 1796 shows Lady Georgiana Gordon (1781\u20131853, presumably \"Lady Godina\"), not yet Duchess of Bedford and indeed only about 16 at most, gambling at a game called Pope Joan, with the winning \"Curse of Scotland\" in her hand.  At left is Albinia Hobart, Countess of Buckinghamshire, perhaps the hostess.  She was famous for hosting gambling parties. Behind the card-tables is a tight crush of people."]}, {"page": "George Hobart, 3rd Earl of Buckinghamshire", "response": ["*Lady Albinia Hobart, married Richard Cumberland on 14 Jul 1784 and had issue"]}, {"page": "Faro Ladies", "response": ["Gaming in public was not acceptable for aristocratic women as it was for aristocratic men in 18th century England, who played at social clubs such as the Tory-affiliated White's or the Whig-affiliated Brooks's.  Thus, women gambled in private houses at social gatherings that often provided other, more socially acceptable forms of entertainment, such as musical concerts or amateur theatricals.Russell, Gillian.  \u201cFaro\u2019s Daughters\u201d: Female Gamesters, Politics, and the Discourse of Finance in 1790s Britain.\u201d  Eighteenth-Century Studies (2000): 33.4, p. 484.

It has the subtitle \"being the history of Albinia Cecil and of those who have borne her name, with a new and particular account of the celebrated Albinia Bertie, countess of Buckinghamshire, and her immediate descendants, illustrations and genealogies collected by A. F. Stewart.\" Albinia Cecil was a daughter of Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon. Albinia Bertie after her marriage was known as Albinia Hobart. A. F. Stewart was the collaborator Albinia Stewart who finished the book after Albinia Wherry's death in 1929, with help from Robin Cust (whose original idea it had been). She mentions in the Introduction also the help given to Albinia Wherry by Horace Bleackley, as well as genealogical writers. Robin Cust, after the Introduction, attributed the idea to Bertie Hobart, and described Albinia Stewart as a cousin. She was Albinia Frances Adelaide Stewart (1879\u20131955), a grand-daughter of Henry Lewis Hobart, father of Maria Hobart."]}, {"page": "Albinia, Countess of Buckinghamshire", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albinia Hobart"]}]}}
