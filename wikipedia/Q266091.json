It debuted at number one on both the Irish and UK Albums Charts, going 4\u00d7 Platinum in Ireland and Platinum in the UK. It spawned two hit singles: \"No Promises\" and \"Stand by Me\". The follow-up album, Breathless, featuring the top 10 hits \"If That's OK with You\" and \"No U Hang Up\", was released in November 2007 and topped the Irish charts, where it went 5\u00d7 Platinum.\nIn November 2010, after a three-year hiatus, Ward released his third album, Obsession.
