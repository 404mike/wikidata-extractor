He has also spent time playing in the League of Ireland Premier League for Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Dundalk. He has since made his trade in England's Non-League game for Halifax Town, York City, Tamworth, Worksop Town, Leigh Genesis, Retford United, Gainsborough Trinity, Droylsden, Armthorpe Welfare, Brigg Town, Arnold Town and Rainworth Miners Welfare.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["|2003|| Georges Santos || Darren Mansaram"]}, {"page": "Clint Marcelle", "response": ["In a reward for his consistency in the previous season, Slade contacted Marcelle again and was invited for a pre-season trial with his new club Grimsby Town. Following a trial month, in which Marcelle never really got a look in, in any of the teams friendly games, he was still offered a short-term deal and joined Ashley Sestanovich and Glen Downey as one of three players taken to Blundell Park from his former club. Grimsby was to be his first professional football club in two years. Despite being offered a contract, Marcelle found it extremely hard to break into the team and was often looked past in favour for Michael Reddy, Andy Parkinson and Darren Mansaram, and would often find it very difficult on winning a place on the substitute bench. Marcelle made his only start for the Mariners against Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, and following only four other sub appearances, Marcelle would not play again for Grimsby. Slade decided to bring in two more strikers in Martin Gritton and Colin Cramb, and that coupled with loan signings such as Jon Daly and Chris Williams, Marcelle was eventually released by Grimsby on 31 October 2004."]}, {"page": "Tony Crane", "response": ["Worksop had also signed Darren Mansaram on loan, a former Grimsby teammate of Crane's. With many people expecting Crane to return to Grimsby and fight for his place, he did not and he moved to Worksop on a permanent deal in January 2006 on a free transfer. Tony played out the remainder of the 2005\u20132006 season for the club, but soon attracted more attention from another Welsh club, with The Tigers turning down a bid for Crane from Newport County in December 2006. In May 2007, Worksop were relegated from the Conference North division; this would be Tony's third career relegation, and also meaning he had suffered relegation with every club he had played for. With finances that bad at Worksop, they had had to leave their home stadium, some of the more expensive playing staff were released to reduce costs. Crane would be one of the players who would see his Worksop career end in this fashion."]}, {"page": "David Soames", "response": ["Soames, nicknamed \"Digger\", was part of a decent youth team strike force that also boasted Darren Mansaram. He signed professional terms with Grimsby Town in October 2002 following an injury crisis at the club. He made his debut on 23 November when he was drafted into the squad to face Crystal Palace and played in the club's defeat at Selhurst Park. On Boxing Day 2002, he came off the bench to score his first senior goal in a 3\u20131 away win over Derby County; this would be his only senior goal in professional football. He continued to feature in the first team, but without scoring. In a game against Stoke City he was fouled by defender Sergei Shtanyuk, who was dismissed for his challenge after hacking down Soames, who was clear on goal. Grimsby were unable to avoid relegation from the First Division and rumours circulated that linked Soames with Port Vale and Lincoln City, but nothing ever came of either."]}, {"page": "Jake Sagare", "response": ["Sagare was signed as a striker and rarely featured in the first team with the club having such players as Michael Boulding, Steve Livingstone and Darren Mansaram contracted. On 26 April 2003, with Grimsby already relegated Sagare and other fringe players such as Graham Hockless were handed a chance, with this Sagare made his first and only senior appearance against Reading at the Madjeski Stadium."]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|19 ||  Darren Mansaram || Halifax Town || 20 || Loan", "|19 ||  Darren Mansaram || Halifax Town || 20 || Free Transfer"]}, {"page": "List of 2009\u201310 League of Ireland transfers", "response": ["*  Darren Mansaram to Gainsborough Trinity (Free transfer)"]}, {"page": "List of Sligo Rovers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Darren Mansaram / Paul McTiernan"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|28||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Darren Mansaram"]}, {"page": "List of foreign League of Ireland players", "response": ["* Darren Mansaram \u2013 Sligo Rovers, Bohemians, Dundalk"]}]}}
