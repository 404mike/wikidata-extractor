A cousin of George Canning, he served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister-Plenipotentiary to the United States of America between 1820 and 1824 and held his first appointment as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire between 1825 and 1828. He intermittently represented several constituencies in parliament between 1828 and 1842. In 1841 he was re-appointed as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, a position he held for the next 17 years. In 1852 he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe. Canning's hopes of high political office were repeatedly dashed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crimean War", "response": ["Nicholas fumed at \"the infernal dictatorship of this Redcliffe\" whose name and political ascendancy at the Porte personified for him the whole Eastern Question,Lord Kinross The Ottoman Centuries Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe."]}, {"page": "B\u00e1bism", "response": ["The B\u00e1b's message was disseminated by the Letters of the Living through Iran and southern Iraq. One of these initial activities was communicated to the West starting 8 January 1845 as an exchange of diplomatic reports concerning the fate of Mull\u00e1 \u02bfAli-e Bast\u0101mi, the second Letter. These were exchanges between Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet who wrote first to Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe.

Indeed various activities the B\u00e1b initiated were devolved to various Letters of the Living like preaching activities and answering questions from the community. In particular as these first public activities multiplied opposition by the Islamic clergy arose and prompted the Governor of Shiraz to order the B\u00e1b's arrest. The B\u00e1b, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in June 1845 and presented himself to the authorities. This series of events become the first public account of the new religion in the West when they were published 1 Nov 1845 in The Times.

An outcome of the Crimean War was the British Government's willingness to use its increased influence at Constantinople to intervene on behalf of its Jewish subjects who resided in Jerusalem. On July 13, 1854, James Finn of the British consulate in Jerusalem wrote to the British ambassador in Constantinople describing the wishes of the 2,000 strong Ashkenazic community to build a new synagogue. He noted that funds for construction had been collected by Moses Montefiore twelve years earlier. He also enclosed a 150-year-old firman, which authorised the Ashkenazic Jews to rebuild their ruined synagogue.Gilbert (1985), pp. 79\u201380. As the title to the plot of land was held by the Amzalag family, who were British subjects, they designated London-born Rabbi Hirschell, son of Chief Rabbi of Great Britain Solomon Hirschell, to negotiate the transfer. The British consulate agreed to lend its sanction to the contract in order to avoid possible intrusion by the Turks.Blumberg (1981), pp.\u00a062\u201363. At issue was the question of whether the building of a synagogue at the site constituted the repair of an old house of non-Muslim worship or the establishment of a new synagogue. The Turks would have to grant a special license for the latter. This was received through the efforts of Francis Napier and Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, British ambassadors to the Sublime Porte, who secured the necessary firman in 1854.Blumberg (1981), p. 215. In July 1855, while in Constantinople, Montefiore was handed the firman,Gilbert (1985), p.\u00a084. Differing dates are given for delivery of this firman. Blumberg (1981), pp.\u00a062\u201363, claims it was given in 1856 and Millgram (1990), p.\u00a0112, 1857. which he hand-delivered during his fourth visit to Jerusalem in 1857."]}, {"page": "Peelite", "response": ["After the fall of the Aberdeen government, the Peelite faction took most of the blame for their management of the war in the Crimea.
