After just a year with the \"Foxes\" he moved on to Ipswich Town. In 1986, he signed for Port Vale, where he became the first choice goalkeeper. He spent six years at Vale Park, making almost 200 the Football League appearances, twice winning the club's Player of the Year award and playing in the 1989 Third Division play-off victory. He transferred to Cardiff City in 1992, and won the Third Division title with the club in 1992\u201393, and also picked up two Welsh Cup winners medals. His final club was Hednesford Town, whom he signed for in 1994, and left in 1995. Over the years he also enjoyed short loan spells with Wigan Athletic, Oldham Athletic, Fulham, and Blackburn Rovers.\nHe remained in the game after retirement as a player, spending eight years as a coach at Port Vale before his sacking in 2002. He quickly returned to his coaching position at the club though, and remains a key member of the backroom staff. He has had three separate spells as caretaker-manager at the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Gannon", "response": ["Results continued to go against the Vale though, as on 19 March they lost 3\u20130 at Accrington Stanley, and as a result dropped out of the play-off zone for the first time in the season. Ugly post-match scenes at the Crown Ground saw Geohaghon confront fans who singled him out for abuse, whilst Gannon was ushered quietly out of the back door. Roberts told the media \"I don't think the manager likes me and, to be honest, I don't like him\". Rumours circulated that Gannon would soon be on his way out. These rumours were proved accurate two days later, as Gannon's departure was confirmed by the club. Hugely unpopular with Vale supporters, his sacking was \"quick and with little emotion\", whilst his poor man-management skills helped to earn him the dubious honour of having the shortest reign in the club's history. Despite this he did receive credit for spotting the potential talent in a teenage Sam Morsy, and for bringing Tom Pope to the club. Gannon himself made a statement on his website declaring his disappointment in the club's decision to terminate his contract after such a short period of time, and also bemoaned that he \"wasn't able to add many new players [to the squad]\". The \"Valiants\" continued to struggle under caretaker manager Mark Grew, winning just two of their remaining ten games, and finishing 2010\u201311 in eleventh place."]}, {"page": "Geoff Horsfield", "response": ["In December 2010, he was made joint caretaker manager at Vale, along with Mark Grew, following the departure of Adams. Vale were beaten 5\u20130 by Rotherham United in his first game in charge, but rallied to beat Burton Albion 2\u20131, before Jim Gannon was appointed manager. Gannon retained Horsfield as his assistant. On the way to a match at Aldershot on 25 February, Gannon left the team bus after an apparent bust-up with Horsfield. The national media reported that Gannon granted Horsfield's request for a day off for family reasons but then wrote to the board complaining about his conduct. Having been shown the letter by a director, Horsfield confronted Gannon over the issue. After an internal inquiry, during which Horsfield stayed away from the club, no disciplinary action was taken against either party. Gannon was sacked on 21 March, and Grew was appointed as caretaker-manager with Horsfield as his assistant."]}, {"page": "John Rudge", "response": ["Major signings for the start of the 1986\u201387 season were Mark Grew and Ray Walker (\u00a312,000 from Aston Villa), who would feature heavily for the club in the coming years, as well as Paul Smith. Smith was purchased for \u00a310,000 from Sheffield United and was sold for four times that figure to Lincoln City just over a year later. The club finished mid-table, twelve points above the drop. The winter signing of veteran Bob Hazell helped to shore up the Vale's defence. At the end of the season, Bill Bell was made the club's chairman. Also Darren Beckford was signed from Manchester City for \u00a315,000. He would become the club's top scorer for the next four seasons."]}, {"page": "Paul Cooper (footballer, born 1953)", "response": ["After Robson left to manage England in 1982, his assistant Bobby Ferguson took over as manager.

One of the last members of the Robson-era team still at the club, he left Ipswich on a free transfer in June 1987 and signed for Second Division Leicester City, who were managed by former Ipswich teammate Bryan Hamilton. Hallworth became Ipswich's first choice goalkeeper for the 1987\u201388 season."]}, {"page": "Sean McAllister", "response": ["In describing his playing style, McAllister has said that \"I work hard and I read the game well... [and] I like to get forward\". Port Vale assistant manager Mark Grew said that \"he's a good passer, he has excellent vision and great energy\"."]}, {"page": "Alex Williams (footballer, born 1961)", "response": ["In November 1986 he was sent out on loan to Port Vale, who needed cover for an injured Mark Grew, and was signed permanently by manager John Rudge in January 1987 for a \u00a310,000 fee (plus 50% of any future transfer fees). He settled in well at Vale Park, and made 31 Third Division appearances in 1986\u201387. However, he featured just six times at the start of the 1987\u201388 campaign when he was forced into retirement in September 1987 due to a recurring back injury."]}, {"page": "Calvin Andrew", "response": ["Andrew joined League Two club Port Vale on 26 November 2012 on a two-month contract; the move came days after the club failed to secure Lee Hughes on loan. The move reunited him with former Brighton manager Micky Adams, and Andrew said that \"I think I'll do well here and score a lot of goals\". Assistant manager Mark Grew said that his arrival was a \"big plus\" and that he would provide cover for top goalscorer Tom Pope as both players were \"big and strong\" strikers. He made his full debut at Vale Park on 4 December, in a 2\u20130 defeat to Bradford City in the Football League Trophy. Though often on the bench, he ended the month with \"a hard-working and eye-catching display\" on the left side of midfield in a 3\u20132 win over Dagenham & Redbridge. After his short-term contract expired, he agreed to extend his stay until the end of 2012\u201313. He scored his first goal for the Vale after he was given the rare chance to start a match as a striker on 23 February, in a 1\u20130 win over Torquay United at Plainmoor, after a Doug Loft shot deflected off Andrew into the net. Vale secured promotion with a third-place finish, with Andrew making 24 appearances. He was not offered a new contract at the end of the season and was released as a free agent."]}, {"page": "Gary Roberts (footballer, born 1987)", "response": ["He received interest from Micky Adams' Port Vale, and joined the club on trial in July 2010. Acknowledging \"it's a last-chance saloon\", Roberts said \"I've learnt just not to be a plonker for all my life.\" He joined the team on their July pre-season trip to Ireland, as Adams, already convinced of the player's talents, wanted to test Roberts' ability to stay away from his off-the-field demons. Roberts seemed to enjoy a good start to his Vale career, and after Adams' typically relentless pre-season fitness regime he claimed \"I've turned the corner...I think I've got my act together but I've just got to keep living each day as it comes and as long as I wake up clean that's all that I need\". He signed a six-month contract at the end of the month. He started the season well, maintaining discipline off the pitch, and his first team place on it, forging a midfield partnership with Anthony Griffith. As early as September he entered negotiations with the club to extend his contract, and Roberts quickly signed an extended contract to keep him at the club until the end of the season. However Micky Adams left the club in December 2010, and Roberts did not enjoy a happy relationship with new manager Jim Gannon. Gannon dropped him to the bench after Roberts admitted he did not enjoy playing in a more advanced position; Vale fans showed their support for the player by chanting his name throughout a 1\u20130 win over Rotherham. He then picked up a three-match ban after receiving a red card for violent conduct in a reserve match against Nottingham Forest. Gannon defended Roberts, believing the player was unlucky to be dismissed after he responded to a 'reckless' challenge by David Morgan by shoving Morgan to the ground. In March, speculation that he would leave Vale Park at the end of the season (or earlier) increased, as it was reported by BBC Radio Stoke that the club had informed the player he could leave on loan. However Gannon denied this on the club's website, stating that there was \"no substance\" to the report. In fact he went on to say \"he has a huge part to play\" in the club's promotion campaign. His teammates also showed their support for him by celebrating goals with Roberts' celebration style during his absence; club captain Marc Richards also dedicated his two goals against Shrewsbury Town to Roberts. Gannon's reign was quickly terminated, but Roberts still struggled to regain his form under caretaker-manager Mark Grew."]}]}}
