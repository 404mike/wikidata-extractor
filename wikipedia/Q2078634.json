Most of his theatre work was first produced at the Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent in conjunction with director Peter Cheeseman who championed his work and directed over twenty of his plays.  Cheeseman was crucial in helping Terson to learn how to edit and structure his work.\nTerson was born in Walker, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. His father, Peter Patterson was a joiner.  His first play was A Night to Make the Angels Weep in 1964 - the last was Rumpelstiltskin, a play for children, in 1984.  Many of his plays focused on the Vale of Evesham where Terson lived before becoming resident dramatist at the theatre. He also became an astute adaptor of novels by Arnold Bennett and Herman Melville.  As a result of the success of his work in Stoke, he was invited to write for the National Youth Theatre where his work focused on growing up in the dead-end working-class culture of industrial England. From 1956 to 1958 Terson trained at Redland Teacher Training College in Bristol, a college of Bristol University. He taught for 10 years before writing professionally. He taught History and P.E. at what was then Blackminster County Secondary School, near Littleton, Worcestershire. Terson left Blackminster in the mid-1960s.Plays such as Zigger Zagger, about football hooligans and their pursuit of drink, sex, and trouble, and The Apprentices, showing the cruelties between young men learning industrial trades, presented a dismal view of life with few means of escape. In Zigger Zagger an apprenticeship was the escape from the hooligan lifestyle. These two plays were also taken up by local theatre groups and even appeared in school productions, with local adaptations by the producers for accent, dialect, soccer teams and related slang. Hans Neuenfels' Heidelberg-production of Zikke Zakke has been invited to the Berliner Theatertreffen in 1969. Works for television often took a more optimistic view, especially a series of plays centering on a trio of Yorkshiremen, led by Art (Brian Glover), and their humorous misadventures.   Terson treated the situation of men dealing with life in the modern de-industrialized North in the play Strippers which ran in London's West End theatres.Terson's work is underpinned by poetic but naturalistic dialogue and an unpretentious sense of passion for his sometimes complex characters. His work at 'The Vic' also showed an ability for comedy and an unerring quest for truth. He often said that he was liberated by theatre in the round because there were 'no fake door handles' and admired the minimalistic scenery which allowed the action to move along without the traditional concessions to set design.\nSeveral of his plays have been produced by the National Youth Theatre. In Belgium his play The Mighty Reservoir (in Dutch: Het Machtig Reservoir) reached more than 500 performances by the MMT, a theatre in Mechelen, and a TV-adaption by the BRT, Belgian Television.\nTerson was a prolific writer: over eighty of his plays have been performed and there is a vast catalogue of unperformed scripts at the Victoria Theatre archive at Staffordshire University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aesop's Fables", "response": ["Another musical, Aesop's Fables by British playwright Peter Terson, first produced in 1983, was lifted into another class by Mark Dornford-May's adaptation for the Isango Portobello company at the Fugard Theatre in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2010. The play tells the story of the black slave Aesop, who learns that freedom is earned and kept through being responsible. His teachers are the animal characters he meets on his journeys. The fables they suggest include the Tortoise and the Hare, the Lion and the Goat, the Wolf and the Crane, the Frogs Who Desired a King and three others, brought to life through a musical score featuring mostly marimbas, vocals and percussion.There is a brief excerpt on YouTube Another colourful treatment was Brian Seward's Aesop's Fabulous Fables (2009) in Singapore, which mixes a typical musical with Chinese dramatic techniques."]}, {"page": "List of British playwrights since 1950", "response": ["*Peter Terson"]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Peter Terson", "| Peter Terson", "| Peter Terson", "* The Last Train through the Harecastle Tunnel (written by Peter Terson, directed by Alan Clarke), in the 'Alan Clarke at the BBC' box set from the BFI."]}, {"page": "National Youth Theatre", "response": ["Barbara Broccoli succeeded Lord Waheed Alli and became the NYT's first female President in 2017.

Two months later Terson sent Croft the first draft of Zigger Zagger and with it included a note that read: \"At first I thought it was great, but then I was struck with the thought, 'Who's interested in football nowadays \u2013 it's square!' But if you are interested in the idea and put your own schemes forward, I am still keen to work on it.\" Croft himself was a football fan and was keen to put on the work which explored the themes of football hooliganism and tribalism and the hopelessness of life for many teenagers in 1960s society.
