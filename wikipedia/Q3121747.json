The second was an animal shot in 1915 by natives east of Dibrugarh, Assam. Dollman wrote, \"There can be no doubt that the animals I have referred to above were tigers and not leopards\". In response to Dollman, W.H. Carter wrote in the Times of 16 October 1936\"I was much interested in Captain Guy Dollman's letter on black tigers in The Times of October 14, having been resident in the neighborhood mentioned by him for years. In one of the official district Gazetteers of Bengal (Khulna or Backerganj) there is mentioned a local variety of tiger which had lost its stripes as camouflage in the open sandy tracts of Sundarbans. The uniform color scheme adopted was however, brown and not black, but perhaps his cousin in the hinterland found black more suited to his background. The author of the Gazetteer in question is, I believe, dead.\"", "* Capt.

This large black shrew was first described by the British zoologist Guy Dollman in 1915, the type locality being the vicinity of the Como River in Gabon. The exact definition of this species is unclear; it is often included in Fraser's musk shrew (Crocidura poensis), or reported as Wimmer's shrew (Crocidura wimmeri). Its karyotype is 2n=50, FN-76, which is identical to the Nigerian shrew (Crocidura nigeriae), and the species complex is in need of a thorough revision."]}, {"page": "Spurrell's free-tailed bat", "response": ["It was described as a new species in 1911 by British zoologist Guy Dollman.", "Category:Taxa named by Guy Dollman"]}, {"page": "John Charles Dollman", "response": ["Dollman died in London on 11 December 1934, aged 83.
