As was the case with his predecessor, McClaren repeatedly called for the club to show greater ambition in signing new players, including \"stellar\" signings which would take his squad to the next level, especially since the club had seen 9 players leave in the off-season. Despite these concerns, the transfer window closed with only 5 new additions. After an injury to Chris Cohen, Clint Hill was signed on loan from Queen's Park Rangers, but other loan targets identified by McClaren were not pursued. After a 5\u20131 defeat away to Burnley, McClaren held emergency talks with the club chairman, Nigel Doughty. The result of the meeting was the departure of David Pleat as a club adviser. Pleat had drawn the ire of many fans because of his role in the club's acquisition committee, and rightly or wrongly, it was assumed he had been obstructionist and advised the club not to make expensive new signings. The departure of Pleat, which was also accompanied by the departure of Bill Beswick, was viewed as a sign the club were behind McClaren. However, less than a week later McClaren resigned from his role as manager on 2 October 2011 after a 3\u20131 home defeat to Birmingham City. Forest held a 1\u20130 lead for much of the game before eventually falling apart after Birmingham scored the equaliser. McClaren's disappointment with the lack of new signings was assumed to be behind the reason for his departure, and he left the club without compensation. Nigel Doughty also announced he would resign from his role as chairman at the end of the season, though it was stated he would continue to support the club financially. Doughty had also become an unpopular figure with some supporters since his lack of financial backing for McClaren and his predecessor appeared to be tied to his concerns over financial fair play rules that were to be adopted in the Championship in the near future. A new search for manager and chairman began immediately with the names of former players Nigel Clough, Roy Keane, and Martin O'Neill, among others, being touted by betting agencies to take over the vacant managerial position.", "Following McClaren's departure, chairman Nigel Doughty stepped down as chairman, saying it was 'the honourable thing to do' following McClaren's resignation. Assistant manager Rob Kelly was appointed as caretaker manager following McClaren's dismissal.

On 19 July 2012, Crawley Town manager Sean O'Driscoll was appointed as his replacement, despite the fact he had not taken charge of a single game at his former club. On 26 December 2012, just hours after a 4\u20132 victory over Leeds United, O'Driscoll was sacked. On 27 December 2012, Forest appointed Alex McLeish as their new manager. Chief executive Mark Arthur as well as scout Keith Burt and club ambassador Frank Clark were dismissed in January 2013. On 5 February 2013, Alex McLeish left the club by mutual agreement, just 40 days after McLeish took charge of the club. Pundits and supporters stated their concern for the state of the club, with journalist Pat Murphy describing the situation as a \"shambles\".
