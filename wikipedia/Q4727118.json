This was partly because at the time the crime of paedophilia wasn't frankly discussed. Merely to produce a film dealing openly with the question was deemed sordid and distasteful. Another hindrance to commercial success was that the film was far from easy to categorise, so it was difficult to market to any specific film audience demographic. In terms of genre it had elements of suspense, horror, courtroom drama and social commentary, but did not fit neatly into any general classification. In addition some of the publicity chosen for the film, (such as a promotional poster with an image of armed police with tracker dogs, and the tagline \"A nightmare manhunt for maniac prowler!\"), was misleading, as it implied a fugitive-on-the-run chase thriller. Hammer Studios boss James Carreras later commented: \"Message pictures? I tried one: 'Never Take Sweets from a Stranger'.  Nobody bought it.  I'm not an artist.  I'm a businessman.\"\"London film executive makes money on thrillers\" Reading Eagle, 6 July 1961.

Both Watford and Allen are completely credible while Leggatt, well-served by John Hunter's script, is outstanding.
