He was educated at Marling School in Stroud.\nHe was first elected at the Newport by-election in October 1922, following the death of the Liberal MP Lewis Haslam.  He held the seat until his defeat at the 1929 general election by the Labour Party candidate James Walker. He regained the seat by a large majority at the 1931 general election, and remained Newport's MP until his death in 1945, aged 62, only 12 days following that of Walker.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Reginald Clarry"]}, {"page": "Marling School", "response": ["* Reginald Clarry - Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "Wilfrid Roberts", "response": ["On 19 May, Chuter Ede observed, at a \"Liberal table\" with Roberts the sole Liberal, there were a diverse group: Evans and Reginald Clarry (Conservatives), Alexander Erskine-Hill (Scottish Unionist), Geoffrey Shakespeare (National Liberal) and Bevan (Labour).

They were further enraged when Haslam did not give support for Conservative measures despite their support. The key breach came over the 1921 Licensing Bill which raised the question of whether Monmouthshire was part of Wales or England. This had become a particularly significant local issue, with the Liberals tending to the former position and the Conservatives to the latter. The Bill included Monmouthshire with Wales and so threatened early closing, whilst Haslam's support for the temperance movement provoked further hostility. Consequently the local Conservatives moved to adopt an official candidate of their own for the next general election, choosing Reginald Clarry on 26 July 1922. He received backing from the anti-Coalition wing of the Conservative Party, including endorsements in the Morning Post. His candidature was not well received by the Conservative leadership at Westminster, with Austen Chamberlain, leader of the Conservative MPs, requesting that Conservative Central Office should not aid Clarry's campaign, but crucially Clarry was still the official party nominee for the seat and it would be dangerous for any leader of the party to provoke a row by repudiating the official nominee.", "The Conservatives ran the already selected Reginald Clarry, a self-made man who had worked as a civil engineer."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Reginald Clarry"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|Reginald Clarry"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|Reginald Clarry"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1923 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Reginald Clarry"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Reginald Clarry"]}, {"page": "1945 in Wales", "response": ["*17 January \u2013 Reginald Clarry MP, politician, 62"]}, {"page": "1922 in Wales", "response": ["*18 October - In a by-election at Newport, caused by the death of Liberal MP Lewis Haslam, Reginald Clarry wins the seat for the Conservatives."]}, {"page": "1945 Newport by-election", "response": ["The seat had become vacant on the death of the constituency's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Sir Reginald Clarry, on 17 January 1945, aged 62.
