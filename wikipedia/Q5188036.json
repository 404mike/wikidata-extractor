A left back, he played local football before joining Newcastle United in May 1906, but moved on to Second Division club Grimsby Town without appearing for Newcastle's first team. Henderson played 65 league games for Grimsby over two seasons, earning himself a reputation as a solid defender, but left the club when they failed to be re-elected to the Football League, joining Birmingham, who had finished below Grimsby but whose application for re-election had been successful, in August 1910. He went straight into the starting eleven, but lost his place after six games, and the form, consistency and fitness of the young Frank Womack meant he never regained it. At the end of the 1910\u201311 season, he left for Brighton & Hove Albion, where he played only 12 times in the Southern League before joining Luton Town.Henderson died in Sunderland in 1970 at the age of 84.", "link_mentions": {}}}
