The team began to recover in mid-October, losing just four of the following 17 matches, including two wins in the Football League Trophy and three in the FA Cup, with First Division Derby County being beaten at Griffin Park in the FA Cup third round on 4 January 2003. Brentford limped through the remainder of the season, winning just four and losing 13 of the remaining 24 matches of the season.

Also in March, Ron Noades resigned as chairman and director, citing that \"the death of the transfer market has prevented us from covering our trading losses incurred at Griffin Park\" and revealing that the wage bill would be slashed from \u00a3706,000 for the 2002\u201303 season to \u00a3476,000 for 2003\u201304.
