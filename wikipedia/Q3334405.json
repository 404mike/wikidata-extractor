However, in 2003 he started a simultaneous Mountain Bike Racing career, one of the few BMXers to do so at his stage in his career which was only six years into his BMX amateur career. Most BMXers who cross over to MTB racing do so after his BMX career or in its last few years. John Tomac, Tinker Juarez started MTB racing after their BMX careers. Pete Loncarevich, Eric Carter, Bas de Bever, Corine Dorland and Dale Holmes started their MTB careers during the one or two twilight years of BMX racing. Among the exceptions is Wade Bootes that started MTB racing essentially during the middle of his BMX career. It is difficult for a  racer to train effectively at the championship level for either of the two disciplines although skills for one easily translate to the other, still the training regimen for one is different enough to adversely affect the other. As a result, most start the crossover just about at the end of their usually long BMX racing careers."]}, {"page": "Brian Foster (BMX rider)", "response": ["*\"Q&A: Have you ever cheated racing?\", Snap BMX Magazine, May 1999, vol. 6, issue 3, no. 31, p.\u00a024.
