In other first-class games, he played for the United All-England Eleven (1860), an England \"Next XIV\" (1860), the North of England (1863), and the All-England Eleven (1864).\nSlinn was born in Sheffield and died, aged 61, in June 1888 in Wortley, Leeds. He was a right-arm fast roundarm bowler. He took 111 wickets in his nineteen first-class matches at an average of 13.20 with a best analysis of eight for 33 against Surrey. He took five wickets in an innings nine times, and ten wickets in a match on four occasions. He was less successful as a right-handed batsman, scoring 46 runs at an average of only 2.00, with a best score of 11. When fielding, he held eleven catches.Besides Yorkshire, he played county cricket matches for Buckinghamsire, Rutland, Monmouthshire, Northamptonshire, and a single match in 1865 for Shropshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Wednesday Cricket Club", "response": ["Several prominent local cricketers appeared for the Wednesday club, such as Michael Ellison, William Slinn, Tom Hunt, George Pinder, Tom Armitage, George Ulyett, and Tom Marsden. Ellison went on to help form Yorkshire County Cricket Club whilst Armitage and Ulyett were selected for England's first Test cricket tour of Australia in 1877. Marsden was for many years the best single wicket cricketer in the north of England and was said to have put up a \u00a350 reward for anyone to beat him. The great southern cricketer of the time, Fuller Pilch, did just that in 1833, beating Marsden in Norwich. When a rematch was organised, over 20,000 crammed into the Old Darnall ground hoping to see Marsden defeated once more. Marsden also scored 227 in a game for Sheffield & Leicester versus Nottingham, at that time only the third double century seen in England. In 1841, Marsden he finally lost his northern single wicket crown to Henry Sampson, another Wednesday player, who later that year scored 162 against Sheffield."]}, {"page": "Slinn", "response": ["*William Slinn (1826\u20131888), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Slinn, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Slinn"]}]}}
