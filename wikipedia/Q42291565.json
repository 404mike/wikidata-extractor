Her father was a pharmaceutical chemist and dental surgeon. She attended the Royal Holloway College from 1893 to 1897, obtaining a BSc in Chemistry. She was most likely taught there by Elizabeth Eleanor Field. After graduating from Royal Holloway with a BSc (First Class), she was awarded a Bathurst Studentship, which were founded in 1882 for the encouragement of advanced work in any of the natural sciences at Newnham College, Cambridge.  She completed her studentship from 1899 to 1900 working for Henry Fenton, and returned to Royal Holloway in 1901, to take up a position as Demonstrator in Chemistry.  She resigned her position in 1903 and married William Hobson Mills.  Mills had recently been appointed to the Chemical Department of Northern Polytechnic as a lecturer in chemistry. By 1911, the couple had 4 young children, and lived with 2 servants at their home in Crouch End, in North London.1911 Census Two of her daughters would later be students at Newnham, and a third later became a staff member there. Gostling died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 19 February 1962."]}, {"page": "1904 petition to the Chemical Society", "response": ["# Elizabeth Eleanor Field\t\t", "The network that allowed these women to co-sponsor the petition has been examined. Smedley, Freund, and Whiteley led the petition. Smedley attended the King Edward VI High School as did Thomas and Hartle. Freund was a demonstrator and a lecturer at Newnham College, Cambridge between 1887 and 1912, as were Elizabeth Eleanor Field, Dorothy Marshall, and Mildred Gostling. Thomas, Field, Whiteley, and Gostling spent time at Royal Holloway College, from where there were two additional petitioners: Margaret Seward and Sibyl Widdows. Clare de Brereton Evans and Millicent Taylor attended the Cheltenham Ladies' College, Cheltenham and Taylor had connections with the University of Bristol, where Emily Fortey and Katherine Williams studied. Lucy Boole studied at the London School of Medicine for Women and Katherine Burke studied at University College London under the supervision of William Ramsay - both of these women knew de Brereton Evans. Grace Toynbee studied at the University of Birmingham, and was possibly connected with Hartle. Two petitioners Edith Humphrey and Alice Smith have unknown connections to the remainder, but it is proposed that they were connected by male chemists keen to promote their cause, such William Ramsay."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Field", "response": ["* Elizabeth Eleanor Field, British chemist"]}]}}
