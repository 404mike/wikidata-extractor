It involved close collaboration between academia and industry. One of the first people to put forward the idea for nanopore sequencing was Professor David Deamer. In 1989 he sketched out a plan to drive a single-strand of DNA through a protein nanopore embedded into a thin membrane as part his work to synthesise RNA from scratch. Realising that the same approach might hold potential to improve DNA sequencing, Deamer and his team spent the next decade testing it out. In 1999 Deamer and his colleagues published the first paper using the term 'nanopore sequencing' and two years later produced an image capturing a hairpin of DNA passing through a nanopore in real time. Another foundation for nanopore sequencing was laid by the work of a team led by Professor Hagan Bayley who from the 1990s began to independently develop stochastic sensing, a technique that measures the change in an ionic current passing through a nanopore to determine the concentration and identity of a substance. By 2005 Bayley had made substantial progress with the method to sequence DNA and co-founded Oxford Nanopore to help push the technology further. In 2014 the company released its first portable nanopore sequencing device. This made it possible for DNA sequencing to be carried out almost anywhere, even in remote areas with limited resources. It has been used in the COVID-19 pandemic. A quarter of all the world's SARS-Cov2 virus genomes have now been sequenced with nanopore devices. The technology also offers an important tool for combating antimicrobial resistance, an increasingly public health threat.Lara Marks, Nanopore Sequencing", "Professor Hagan Bayley proposed in 2010 that creating two recognition sites within an alpha-hemolysin pore may confer advantages in base recognition."]}, {"page": "King's School, Chester", "response": ["*Hagan Bayley FRS, scientist and Head of Chemical Biology at the University of Oxford"]}, {"page": "Awards, lectures and medals of the Royal Society", "response": ["|Mullard Award||align=center|1967||Awarded \"to an individual who has an outstanding academic record in any area of natural science, engineering or technology and whose work is currently making or has the potential to make a contribution to national prosperity in the United Kingdom\" the Mullard Award is aimed at scientists and engineers in the early stages of their career and is accompanied by a \u00a32000 gift.||align=center| Hagan Bayley 2019||"]}, {"page": "Mullard Award", "response": ["|2019 || Hagan Bayley || || "]}, {"page": "Oxford University Innovation", "response": ["* Oxford Nanopore Technologies a company using nanopore sequencing founded by Hagan Bayley et al."]}, {"page": "Jeremy R.
