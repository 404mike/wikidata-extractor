Bewes Strangways\", was an explorer, early settler and Colonial Secretary of South Australia.\nStrangways was the second son of late Henry Bull Strangways of Shapwick, Somerset, England. He and his brother Giles E. Strangways arrived in the new colony on HMS Buffalo with  Governor John Hindmarsh and he was engaged to one of Hindmarsh's daughters. However, they never married and Strangways later married Lavinia Albina n\u00e9e Fowler (c. 1810 \u2013 22 October 1883). He sat on the Street Naming Committee, where Strangways Terrace, located in North Adelaide was named after him.\nIn November 1837, Strangways, Young Bingham Hutchinson and a party explored the Fleurieu Peninsula and Lake Alexandrina region, searching for other outlets to the Southern Ocean. In the process, they \"discovered\" Currency Creek, which they named after the whale boat they were using, the Currency Lass.\nHe was the uncle of future South Australian Premier, Henry Strangways. Giles E. Strangways, (an associate of John Finnis and Charles Sturt in their pioneering cattle drive of 1838), was a brother.\nStrangways was a member of the South Australian Legislative Council and Colonial Secretary from 22 August 1837 to 12 July 1838.Strangways died in Glenelg, South Australia or St. Leonard's on 23 February 1859, aged 49.\nHis widow, an invalid, went to live with H. B. T. Strangways, then with Mrs. B. Clark at Childers Street, North Adelaide in an arrangement which has the appearance of protective custody. In 1865 her nephew, Mr. C. Fowler, a Miss Fowler, and a sister-in-law Mrs. Lorimer, sought a writ of habeas corpus against them, claiming that her family and friends had been denied access to her. As a result, Mrs. Strangways was taken in Rounsevell's carriage to Mr. Fowler's home \"Elderslie\" at Woodside, where she died some eighteen years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Currency Creek, South Australia", "response": ["In December 1837, while exploring the Lake and Murray Mouth looking for other outlets to the sea, a party lead by Thomas Bewes Strangways and Young Bingham Hutchinson discovered the waterway while using a whaleboat borrowed from the Encounter Bay fishery. The whaleboat, which in September 1837 had been sold off the schooner Currency Lass at Adelaide, bore the same name as its mother ship, and they named the creek in honour of this boat. They reported on the good grassland in the area and its potential for agriculture."]}, {"page": "Henry Strangways", "response": ["Strangways was the eldest son of Henry Bull Strangways of Shapwick, Somerset, England.

He went to Adelaide early in the following year, was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Encounter Bay in January 1858, and became Attorney-General of South Australia in the First Reynolds Ministry from May 1860 to May 1861.

Some exceptions are due to Governor Hindmarsh and Judge Jeffcott wishing to name streets after their friends. Strangways Terrace was named after Thomas Bewes Strangways, a committee member who was also a prospective son-in-law to the Governor. Pulteney Street was named after Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm who had recommended that Hindmarsh be appointed first Governor of the colony.  More controversially, Archer Street was to have been named Willoughby Street, after Sir Henry Willoughby, a British MP who had initially opposed the South Australia Bill, but was later won over and convinced others also to change their votes. Through the Governor's interference, the name was changed to Archer, after a landowner who had given him some sheep.
