Many of these stories emanate from South Korea. John Delury from Yonsei University has argued that there is a demand for sensationalist news about North Korea: \"There's a global appetite for any North Korea story and the more salacious the better. Some of it is probably true \u2013 but a great deal of it is probably not...the normal standards of journalism are thrown out of the window because the attitude is: 'it's North Korea \u2013 no one knows what's going on in there.'\" Australian academic Jeffrey Robertson has said that North Korea is an \"easy target\" for media organisations driven by clickbait and soundbite. Jean Lee, the former Associated Press Pyongyang bureau chief commented that \"when it comes to North Korea, the more horrible, the more salacious, the more entertaining, the more it fits into the narrative as the North Koreans being these insane outliers\", the more likely it is to be published.
