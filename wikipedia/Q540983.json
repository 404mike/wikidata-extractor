His father, who was born in Australia, worked as a technical representative for British Steel before his death at the age of 54. At an early age, Hough was able to memorise about 100 nursery rhymes and, after much pleading, his parents agreed to buy a second-hand piano, for \u00a35 from a local antique shop, for the home. At the age of 12 he suffered what he has described as a \"mini-nervous breakdown\", triggered by a mugging incident, which resulted in him taking almost a year off school. He studied at Chetham's School of Music, which he later described as \"not a wonderful place while I was there\", and at the Royal Northern College of Music. In 1978, he was a finalist in the BBC Young Musician of the Year Competition and won the piano section. In 1982, he won the Terence Judd Award in England. In 1983, he took first prize at the Naumburg International Piano Competition in New York City."]}, {"page": "Eileen Joyce", "response": ["In 1960, during her tour of India, her Delhi recital was attended by the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. During that tour, which also included Hong Kong, she announced she was retiring, and her final recital was at a festival in Stirling, Scotland, on 18 May 1960, where she played two sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, Beethoven's Appassionata sonata, and works by Mendelssohn, Debussy, Chopin, Ravel, Granados and Liszt. She did, however, return to the concert platform a handful of times over the next 21 years, the first not until 1967, when she played Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 with the RPO conducted by Anatole Fistoulari, at the Royal Albert Hall. This was the work that had made her famous in the film Brief Encounter in 1945, and it was to be her last concerto performance. Also in 1967 she appeared with three other harpsichordists and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under Neville Marriner. In 1967 she started to foster the career of the ten-year-old Terence Judd. In 1969 she appeared alongside fellow Australian pianist Geoffrey Parsons in a two-piano recital at Australia House, London. In 1979 she gave a two-piano recital with Philip Fowke. She appeared again with Geoffrey Parsons on 29 November 1981 at a fund-raising concert at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. This proved to be her very last appearance as a pianist (another one was scheduled in 1988 but had to be cancelled).She had planned to play the third piano part in Percy Grainger's The Warriors at a special concert for Australia's Bicentenary on Australia Day 1988, at the Theatre Royal, London, but after practising she had to withdraw due to her stiffened fingers."]}, {"page": "1979 in British music", "response": ["*December - Terence Judd, pianist, 22 (probable suicide)The Glasgow Herald, 25 January 1980"]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists (recorded)", "response": ["* Terence Judd"]}, {"page": "Terence judd", "response": ["#REDIRECT Terence Judd "]}, {"page": "Ferruccio Busoni International Piano Competition", "response": ["|1975|||| Staffan Scheja|| Laszlo Simon and  Terence Judd"]}, {"page": "List of Recipients of the Terence Judd Award", "response": ["This page is a list of known winners of the Terence Judd Award, which was set up in memory of the British pianist Terence Judd '...to further the careers of outstanding young professional pianists....'"]}, {"page": "Maria Curcio", "response": ["*Terence Judd"]}, {"page": "Piano Sonata (Barber)", "response": ["*Terence Judd, released by Chandos"]}, {"page": "Judd (name)", "response": ["* Terence Judd (1957\u20131979), English pianist"]}]}}
