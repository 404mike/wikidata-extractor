In the away leg, \u00dajpest took a one-goal lead after an hour, that tied the scores on aggregate, before Gordon was sent off.

Lovett himself played down the praise he was receiving:It's great to be in the first team and playing with the big names against the big names, but there is a nagging feeling which make me wonder whether you deserve the praise, and whether it's going to last. And I am really lost when they start talking about Duncan Edwards or Ray Barlow, neither of whom I ever saw play. But once the game starts, it's all different. The stars often seem quite ordinary when it's under way.
