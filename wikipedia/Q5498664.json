The former contained the operational staff while the latter was primarily administrative. Tac HQ was a part of Main HQ that could be temporarily split off when Crerar was required to be closer to the action, but he preferred to command from Main HQ, and rarely established  Tac HQ more than  from Main HQ. When possible, Main HQ would be co-located with that of Air Vice-Marshal Leslie (Bingo) Brown's No. 84 Group RAF, and Beament worked closely with his opposite number on Brown's staff, Group Captain Frederick Rosier. Brown was replaced by Air Vice-Marshal Edmund Hudleston on 10 November 1944. Crerar's day normally commenced with being awakened by his batman, who served him a cup of tea. His aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Finlay Morrison would brief him at 06:30, and he would meet with his senior staff officers, Mann, Beament, Walford and the GSO1s for intelligence, air and operations. Crerar would do his paperwork in the morning, and he then visit his corps commanders, accompanied by his other aide, Lieutenant Giles Perodeau. He did not use Mann as his representative like Montgomery used his chief of staff, Major-General Sir Francis de Guingand."]}, {"page": "List of French Americans", "response": ["* Frederick Rosier, Royal Air Force commander"]}, {"page": "1915 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Frederick Rosier, Air Chief Marshal (died 1998)"]}, {"page": "Rosier (surname)", "response": ["* Frederick Rosier (1915\u20131998), Welsh Royal Air Force commander"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (F)", "response": ["# Frederick Rosier"]}, {"page": "No. 229 Squadron RAF", "response": ["On 6 October 1939, 229 Sqn was reformed at RAF Digby as a Fighter squadron and was equipped with Blenheims for a role protecting shipping.
