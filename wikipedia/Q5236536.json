He is best known for his work with Culture Club, ABC, Kylie Minogue and The Cure.\nDavid Levine started his career in 1977 while working as a photographer's assistant. He went on to photograph artists live in concert including Iggy Pop live at the Music Machine London and worked as a stills photographer on music videos with the director Tim Pope. As well as working with Culture Club, Levine also worked with a number of other 1980s acts including ABC, The Cure, Kylie Minogue, Jermaine Jackson, 5 Star, and Siouxsie Sioux. Levine quickly established a style of work in the studio, much copied by other music photographs in the '80s and indeed today his influence can still be seen. That style earned him the nickname 'The man who shot the 80's'. Always filming throughout his stills career, his music videos are as typically stylish and gritty as his stills. Levine's work in both stills and film achieves a style unique to him. \nLevine was invited to lecture at the University of Arts London, London College of Fashion in 2014. He lectured in Fashion Photography while continuing with his busy photography and film career.\nLevine's 2009 portrait of Paul Nicholls is held in the National Portrait Gallery. Levine is currently lecturing on The Art of Fashion and Beauty Photography and Film at the University of Arts London, London College of Fashion.Levine has never won any awards for his work, he is on the record as saying \u201cI don\u2019t do this to get awards, I do it so I know I\u2019m ok at what I do\u201d not ever one to compromise Levine puts friendship ahead of literally anything...\nHe is the younger brother of record producer Steve Levine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Culture Club", "response": ["The band's second album, Colour by Numbers (UK No.\u00a01, US No.\u00a02), was released in 1983.

Fry and White then enlisted the services of Fiona Russell Powell (under the name \"Eden\") and David Yarritu in the band's new line-up. Russell Powell had been a member of the original line-up of the pre-ABC band, Vice Versa. According to an article s published on 7 March 1997,\"Pop groups should not make comebacks, says Fiona Russell Powell\" , The Times, 7 March 1997 she 'chickened out' of Vice Versa's first live gig, and the job as frontman went to Fry. The Fry-White-Russell Powell-Yarritu line-up recorded the album How to Be a ... Zillionaire!, released in 1985. The band's chart success dwindled further in the UK with this album, but they did score their first US Top 10 hit with \"Be Near Me\", which also made the UK Top 30. The album also featured the singles \"(How to Be a) Millionaire\", \"Vanity Kills\" and \"Ocean Blue\". Inspiration for the album's cartoons of the band members was taken from a photo shoot by David Levine whose work featured on many of the sleeves for singles released from this album.
