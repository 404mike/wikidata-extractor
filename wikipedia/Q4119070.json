The Agreement lasted until 1948 when two of the American partners broke free.

Represented by Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, the company's bid failed when it offered payment in rupees rather than the gold that King Abdul-Aziz (also known as Ibn Saud) desired.H. St. J. Philby, Arabian Oil Adventures, The Middle East Institute, 1964, pp. 73\u2013134. SOCAL gained the concession and, joined by the Texas Oil Company in 1936, went on to discover oil at Dammam through its subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil Company (Casoc) in 1938. Thereafter, IPC concentrated its efforts in Arabia in developing its Qatar oil concession (oil discovered 1939), Abu Dhabi (oil discovered in 1959), Oman (see Petroleum Development Oman) and the Aden Protectorates (in today's Yemen). IPC personnel carried out a series of ground-breaking explorations in southern Arabia during these years.", "In 1948, IPC published its Handbook of the Territories which Form the Theatre of Operations of the Iraq Petroleum Company Limited and its Associated Companies authored by Stephen Hemsley Longrigg.

When Ibn Saud\u2019s adviser, the former British colonial officer Harry St. John Philby, got wind of his arrival he attempted to deter Holmes from joining the negotiations by informing him that he was persona non grata in Jeddah and was remembered for the failure to exploit the first al-Hasa concession. There was also the matter of \u00a36,000 rent owed to Ibn Saud. Holmes appeared undaunted. \u201cHolmes does not seem to share the otherwise universally held belief that Ibn Saud regards him unfavourably,\u201d wrote the IPC representative, Stephen Hemsley Longrigg.For Philby\u2019s version of events, see Arabian Oil Ventures, pp. 98 \u2013 99; for Longrigg\u2019s version see his letter to J. Skirilos of 12 April 1933, PC/10A BP Archive, Warwick University; also see Keating, Mirage, pp. 421 \u2013 422. In fact, Holmes probably had no intention of joining in but simply wanted to exclude the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait from the negotiations. After three days, during which time he met with Saudi finance minister Abdullah Suleiman, Holmes left Jeddah and took no part in the al-Hasa negotiations. The concession for al-Hasa (excluding the Neutral Zone) went to SOCAL. The company formed an operating company, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC), joined forces with the Texas Oil Company and struck commercial oil at Dammam in March 1938. CASOC went on to become Aramco in 1944."]}, {"page": "Red Line Agreement", "response": ["Years later, Walter C.

It had shifted further west due to the floods of the early 7th century (before this, its course was the same as it is today). It passed the city of Wasit and entered the Batihah at the town of Qatr. According to Donald Hill, after about 1200, the Tigris and Euphrates started to gradually shift toward their present courses, which they finally reached during the 1500s.

The author uses oriental sources, the books of Iraqi historians and the experience of his long residence in Iraq to discuss the country\u2019s turbulent history.
