They were the Englishman William Stott of Oldham and the American Abbott Handerson Thayer. Both men were to remain important figures in Dow's personal and professional life and, as both had strong personalities and strong ideas about art, they came to exert a considerable influence over the artistic choices he made.  Among other friends studying in Paris at the time were the Glasgow-based artists John Lavery, Alexander Roche, James Paterson and Alexander Mann.", "The US visit had re-invigorated Dow. His letters to Thayer between 1885 and 1887 reveal his renewed enthusiasm for landscape. During this period he produced Ragweed and Crows (Hunterian, University of Glasgow), among other fine paintings. Dow traveled out of the city, south to Moniaive, for his first allegorical painting The Coming of Spring, and north for his study of birches, In a Wood at Forres, which was bought by Alexander Mann.  He had begun a series of commissions, the first being Portrait of John Nairn (Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery) and writes of working on a likeness in pastels of his sister Mary Lady in Black (private collection). Dow was at this time sharing the Glasgow studio of William York Macgregor and living with Mary and her husband Allan McLean, the lawyer, amateur painter and art collector."]}, {"page": "Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts", "response": ["* Alexander Mann"]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"M\"", "response": ["*Alexander Mann (1853\u20131908), Scottish painter"]}, {"page": "James Mann (curator)", "response": ["James Gow Mann was born in Norwood, London, the only son of Alexander Mann, the eminent Scottish landscape artist, and Catherine Macfarlane Gow.
