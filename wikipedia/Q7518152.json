Central defenders Kov\u00e1cs and Beckwith were both criticised in the defeat, the latter scoring an own goal and the former dropped from the first-team for Luton's next game against Tamworth on 25 September. Luton won the game 2\u20131 with goals from substitutes Yaser Kasim and Fleetwood. With the team still conceding goals from set-pieces, Buckle signed Guiseley and England C captain and centre-back Simon Ainge on a month's loan on 27 September. On the same day, left-back Greg Taylor and midfielder Adam Watkins, neither of whom had been playing in the first-team, were sent on one-month loans to Tamworth and Kidderminster Harriers respectively. Ainge partnered fellow loanee Connor Essam in central defence two days later as Luton beat Southport 3\u20131, with Kov\u00e1cs and Beckwith not even in the squad of 16 players.

The club then suffered their heaviest defeat in over four years with a 5\u20131 loss to Gateshead in what proved the lowest ever match attendance at a competitive Luton game; the game was played in front of only 382 fans. John Still did not attend the match, leaving assistant Terry Harris in charge while he instead scouted players for the 2013\u201314 season. The result saw Luton slip to 12th position in the table with relegation still a mathematical possibility, though this fear was allayed three days later as the club won 3\u20130 against Lincoln City. The next match saw Luton draw 1\u20131 with Grimsby Town, with the club described as playing \"some of their best football of the season\" and having 21 shots during the game. Leading scorer Andre Gray added two further goals to his season's total in a 2\u20132 home draw with promotion-chasing Newport County on 16 April.

Four players, Dean Brill, Simon Ainge, Lathaniel Rowe-Turner and Scott Rendell, were transfer listed following the game.

He played in both legs of Eastleigh's play-off semi-final in April 2013, which ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Dover Athletic.
