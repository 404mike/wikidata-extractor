His grandfather was a French nobleman who escaped the guillotine during the French Revolution. At the age of 16 he migrated to Australia and later he travelled to South America and North America. He later became an island trader in the central Pacific. From 1867 to 1872 he had dealings with Ben Pease and Bully Hayes, two of the more notorious captains of ships and blackbirders that operated in the Pacific at that time.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tuvalu", "response": ["In 1892, Captain Davis of  reported on trading activities and traders on each of the islands visited.

From 1900, the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined; the last of them were Fred Whibley on Niutao, Alfred Restieaux on Nukufetau, and Martin Kleis on Nui. By 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies, although Whibley, Restieaux and Kleis remained in the islands until their deaths."]}, {"page": "History of Tuvalu", "response": ["These trading companies engaged palagi traders who lived on the islands, some islands would have competing traders with dryer islands only have a single trader.

Restieaux recounts the two stories that he had been told: the first was that Pease drowned after jumping overboard from a Spanish man-of-war, the second,  that he was killed in a fight in the Bonin Islands. In any event, when the Pioneer arrived back to port, Hayes was in sole command.
