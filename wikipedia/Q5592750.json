As Glamorgan's second innings progressed, it became clear that Kent could not win by bowling Glamorgan out, so Mark Benson, the Kent captain, asked wicket-keeper Steve Marsh and batsman Graham Cowdrey to bowl; their five overs cost 112, and Glamorgan declared on 255 for four setting Kent 310 to win.  Glamorgan's Matthew Maynard had scored 119*, including 34 runs off one of the overs bowled by Marsh. Kent's gamble did not pay off; they were dismissed for 273 including 118 from Trevor Ward (Robert Croft took six for 112), and Glamorgan won by 36 runs.
