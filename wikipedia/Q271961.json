Her first book, Domestic Manners of the Americans (1832) is the best known. She also wrote social novels: one against slavery said to have influenced Harriet Beecher Stowe, the first industrial novel, and two anti-Catholic novels that used a Protestant position to examine self-making. Some recent scholars note how modernist critics exclude women writers such as Frances Trollope from consideration. In 1839, The New Monthly Magazine claimed, \"No other author of the present day has been at once so read, so much admired, and so much abused\". Two of her sons, Thomas Adolphus and Anthony, became writers. Her daughter-in-law Frances Eleanor Trollope (n\u00e9e Ternan), second wife of Thomas Adolphus Trollope, was also a novelist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Writer", "response": ["Writers may write a particular piece for payment (even if at other times, they write for another reason), such as when they are commissioned to create a new work, transcribe an original one, translate another writer's work, or write for someone who is illiterate or inarticulate. In some cases, writing has been the only way an individual could earn an income. Frances Trollope is an example of women who wrote to save herself and her family from penury, at a time when there were very few socially acceptable employment opportunities for them. Her book about her experiences in the United States, called Domestic Manners of the Americans became a great success, \"even though she was over fifty and had never written before in her life\" after which \"she continued to write hard, carrying this on almost entirely before breakfast\". According to her writer son Anthony Trollope \"her books saved the family from ruin\"."]}, {"page": "Anthony Trollope", "response": ["In 1827, his mother Frances Trollope moved to America with Trollope's three younger siblings, to Nashoba Commune. After that failed, she opened a bazaar in Cincinnati, which proved unsuccessful. Thomas Trollope joined them for a short time before returning to the farm at Harrow, but Anthony stayed in England throughout. His mother returned in 1831 and rapidly made a name for herself as a writer, soon earning a good income. His father's affairs, however, went from bad to worse. He gave up his legal practice entirely and failed to make enough income from farming to pay rents to his landlord, Lord Northwick. In 1834, he fled to Belgium to avoid arrest for debt. The whole family moved to a house near Bruges, where they lived entirely on Frances's earnings."]}, {"page": "1832 in literature", "response": ["*Frances Trollope \u2013 Domestic Manners of the Americans"]}, {"page": "1779 in literature", "response": ["*March 10 \u2013 Frances Trollope (born Frances Milton), English novelist and writer (died 1863)"]}, {"page": "Domestic Manners of the Americans", "response": ["Frances Trollope travelled to the US with her son Henry, \"having been partly instigated by the social and communistic ideas of a lady whom I well remember, a certain Miss Wright, who was, I think, the first of the American female lecturers\" (Anthony Trollope, An Autobiography). She briefly stayed at the Nashoba Commune, a utopian settlement for ex-slaves set up by Frances Wright in Tennessee, but was dismayed by the primitive conditions.", "The book created a sensation on both sides of the Atlantic, as Frances Trollope had a caustic view of the Americans and found America strongly lacking in manners and learning. She was appalled by America's egalitarian middle-class and by the influence of evangelicalism that was emerging during the Second Great Awakening. Trollope was also harshly critical of slavery of African Americans in the United States, and by the popularity of tobacco chewing, and the consequent spitting, even on carpets."]}, {"page": "Frances Eleanor Trollope", "response": ["Her younger sister Ellen Ternan became the mistress of Charles Dickens and because of his intercession she was recommended as a prospective governess to the child of his widowed friend Thomas Trollope, following the death of his wife Theodosia Trollope. Ternan soon married Tom Trollope despite an age difference of 25 years. The marriage took place within five months of her becoming a governess in Florence. She became his second wife.Claire Tomalin,The Invisible Woman, p.6 She also became the sister-in-law of Anthony Trollope and daughter-in-law of Frances Milton Trollope, whose biography Frances Trollope: Her Life and Literary Work from George III to Victoria she authored."]}, {"page": "Life in Mexico", "response": ["While Calder\u00f3n\u2019s Life in Mexico was initially well-received in Boston and London in part due to Prescott\u2019s approval, it was ridiculed by Spaniards in Mexico and the Mexican press for its negative portrayals of Mexicans. In fact, Calder\u00f3n\u2019s account was considered to be so offensive, she was compared to Frances Trollope, a female travel writer who had conveyed her dislike for Americans and their customs. Part of the offensive nature of her narrative likely stemmed from the Scottish/European Enlightenment thought about the superiority of Europeans and the inferiority of de-colonized peoples."]}]}}
