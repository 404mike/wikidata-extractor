He missed several matches for Newcastle to ensure he was fit for Wales's matches. This decision angered Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd, who tried to block Bellamy from appearing for Wales until he returned to action for his club side. Shepherd threatened to sue the Football Association of Wales (FAW) if Bellamy featured for Wales but this was later dismissed. Bellamy underwent the surgery but returned to Newcastle to be informed by Shepherd the club were willing to sell Bellamy if he failed to return to form. He missed more than three months of the campaign in recovery before returning to first-team action on 31 January 2004 in a 1\u20131 draw with Birmingham City. Bellamy enjoyed a prolific scoring run following his return, scoring seven goals in two months before his season was ended due to a pulled hamstring as Newcastle finished fifth. In March 2004, media reports stated Bellamy threw a chair at first-team coach John Carver after a public argument between the pair. The altercation occurred when the squad was travelling to play a UEFA Cup fixture with Real Mallorca and Bellamy refused to travel. Robson persuaded Bellamy to attend the match after a lengthy discussion; Bellamy praised Robson's handling of the incident and blamed the argument with Carver on pranks that had got out of hand."]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team", "response": ["| John Carver"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 in English football", "response": ["*30 August 2004 \u2013 Newcastle United manager Sir Bobby Robson is sacked after a poor start to the Premier League season amid reports of dressing-room discontent.
