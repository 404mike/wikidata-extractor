He became a Football League referee in 1954 and an international referee in 1960. Throughout his league career he sent off only three players. Outside football he was the director of a Sheffield engineering company.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pel\u00e9", "response": ["Pel\u00e9 scored the first goal from a free kick against Bulgaria, becoming the first player to score in three successive FIFA World Cups, but due to his injury, a result of persistent fouling by the Bulgarians, he missed the second game against Hungary. His coach stated that after the first game he felt \"every team will take care of him in the same manner\". Brazil lost that game and Pel\u00e9, although still recovering, was brought back for the last crucial match against Portugal at Goodison Park in Liverpool by the Brazilian coach Vicente Feola. Feola changed the entire defense, including the goalkeeper, while in midfield he returned to the formation of the first match. During the game, Portugal defender Jo\u00e3o Morais fouled Pel\u00e9, but was not sent off by referee George McCabe; a decision retrospectively viewed as being among the worst refereeing errors in World Cup history. Pel\u00e9 had to stay on the field limping for the rest of the game, since substitutes were not allowed at that time. After this game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup, a decision he would later change."]}, {"page": "1966 FIFA World Cup", "response": ["* George McCabe"]}, {"page": "Derek Dooley (footballer)", "response": ["After being sacked by Wednesday he took a job in public relations at a Leeds firm.

This was McCabe's last match before retirement and in the summer Burns took his place on the FIFA List. His greatest domestic honour came in 1973 when he refereed the FA Cup Final between Leeds and Sunderland at Wembley. This is a well-remembered Final, not least for a crucial double-save by North East goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery, as Sunderland, of the old Second Division, defeated Leeds, one of the top clubs in the country at that time, by 1 goal to nil.
