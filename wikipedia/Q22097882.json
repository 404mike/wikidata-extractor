In the early part of the campaign, consistency was a problem as they slipped into mid-table in the league and crashed out of the FA Cup, FA Trophy and Middlesex Senior Cup's at the first hurdle. However success was to follow in both the Southern League Cup and Middlesex Charity Cup's as the Woods made decent progress. The arrivals of Cockfosters duo Mitch Swain and John Christian\u00a0\u2013 who both made over 100 appearances in previous spells with the side\u00a0\u2013 and St Albans City defender Reece Yorke added much needed depth to the squad and all three would play crucial roles later on in the season. Top scorer and eventual Supporters Player of the Year Oliver Hawkins would prove the major catalyst in their assault up the table scoring several goals in a ten-game period.", "Bellotti followed up that superb showing to net a last gasp winner at home to Burnham in the penultimate game of the league season to take the race for the last play-off position down to the final game, although the Woods would let that slip away against Leighton Town as they conceded four times in the opening half-hour to narrowly fall short of a top five finish, ending up in a respectable 7th position. Undeterred by their heavy final day defeat, Northwood raced into a 2\u20130 half time lead in the Middlesex Charity Cup final thanks to goals from Lee Grant and Oliver Hawkins. And when\u00a0\u2013 two minutes after the interval\u00a0\u2013 Hawkins scored his second it appeared the trophy was heading to Chestnut Avenue for the very first time. Yet, young Ashford striker Kofi Lockhart-Adams scored four times in twenty minutes to give his side an unlikely 4\u20133 lead with minutes to go. However, Romaine Walker scored a late leveller to take the game to penalties, but Jack Hutchinson and Walker saw their spot kicks saved, and Ashford subsequently claimed the trophy."]}, {"page": "Northolt High School", "response": ["** Oliver Hawkins, football player"]}, {"page": "Sam Russell (footballer, born 1982)", "response": ["On 1 July 2016, it was announced that Russell had returned to former club Forest Green Rovers on a two-year deal.
