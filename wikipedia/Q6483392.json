He formed a rock and roll group called the Firecrests while a student at Birkenhead School, and served as lead vocalist; they recorded the songs \"That'll Be the Day\", \"I Knew From the Start\", and \"Party\", but were strictly a local attraction. After leaving University early, Morris was discovered by impresario Larry Parnes while working and singing at the 2i's Coffee Bar in London. Parnes gave him the stage name Lance Fortune, a name he had previously considered for another artist he signed in 1959, Georgie Fame. The newly christened Fortune signed to Pye Records as a solo artist, and released four singles, two of which became hits in the UK Singles Chart in 1960. \"Be Mine\" reached No. 4, whilst the follow-up, \"This Love I Have For You\" was a Top 30 hit.In April 1960, Fortune and Jerry Keller replaced Eddie Cochran on Gene Vincent's then current UK tour, after Cochran's untimely death in a road accident.Later in the 1960s, Fortune joined a group called the Staggerlees.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Action", "response": ["* \"Action\", a 1960 song by Lance Fortune"]}, {"page": "Joe Meek", "response": ["| Lance Fortune", "| Lance Fortune"]}, {"page": "Birkenhead School", "response": ["*Christopher Morris (born 1940), pop singer known as Lance Fortune"]}, {"page": "Larry Parnes", "response": ["After Steele's success, Parnes looked to find other young men who he could groom to become pop stars. At Bart's suggestion, he next signed Reg Patterson (n\u00e9 Smith), whom he re-christened Marty Wilde, and who also rose to pop stardom in the UK.  Parnes developed a network of contacts within the British recording industry and entertainment business, with leading British songwriters providing songs for his growing stable of talent, and many of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s achieving success in the UK Singles Chart.  A flamboyant gay man, Parnes' approach was to select, and then groom, handsome young men who would be attractive to a teenage audience. He also gave them new stage names, which were rumoured to reflect what he considered to be their sexual characteristics.  Among those he managed with at least some degree of success were Billy Fury (originally Ron Wycherley), Vince Eager (Roy Taylor), Dickie Pride (Richard Knellar), Lance Fortune (Chris Morris), Duffy Power (Ray Howard), Johnny Gentle (John Askew), Terry Dene (Terence Williams), Nelson Keene (Malcolm Holland), and Georgie Fame (Clive Powell).
