Moody was signed by Southampton from non league Waterlooville in August 1991. After failing to secure regular first team football at Saints, Moody joined Oxford initially on loan in Feb 1994 and permanent deal was secured soon after. Moody became a fans favourite at the Manor Ground. Fulham signed Moody the summer of 1997 to spearhead the promotion push required by Mohammed Al Fayed. Moody remained at Craven Cottage until the summer of 1999. During his time at Fulham he suffered a broken leg but scored a hat trick on his return to the first team as Fulham celebrated winning the Division 2 title. Moody was signed by London neighbours Millwall in June 1999 for \u00a3150,000. Moody became a fans favourite in his 2 years at the Den due his uncompromising style of play. Moody formed a lethal partnership with Neil Harris and won yet another Division 2 title with the Lions. In September 2001 Moody returned to Oxford, initially on loan but a \u00a3150,000 fee was agreed a week later for a permanent deal. After an initially bright start at Oxford things began to deteriorate due to results and change of manager Moody left in the summer of 2002 and joined Isthmian League side Aldershot Town. \nMoody started well at Aldershot but was frozen out of team around Christmas 2002... he never played for Aldershot again and after becoming disillusioned with the game he retired from the full-time game in 2003.\nMoody had a short spell at Wessex League side Gosport Borough but retired completely after injury problems.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford United F.C.", "response": ["Denis Smith brought in two strikers who were experienced in the top division: Southampton's Paul Moody and Nottingham Forest's Nigel Jemson. Oxford finished seventh in 1994\u201395 season,Brodetsky p.86. and in the following season gained promotion by finishing runners-up to rivals Swindon Town, despite not winning an away game till the end of January. Robin Herd, co-owner of the March Racing Team, took control of the club in 1995. In June of that year, the board of directors unveiled plans for a new 16,000-seat stadium at Minchery Farm, to replace the dilapidated Manor Ground. The club had hoped to move into the new stadium near the Blackbird Leys housing estate by the start of the 1998\u201399 season, but construction was suspended during the preceding season, because construction company Taylor Woodrow had not been paid for the work already undertaken.Brodetsky p.90."]}, {"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["Smith made a return to management with Oxford on 10 September 1993, and the following day led them to a 4\u20132 victory over his former club Bristol City.

He signed goalkeeper Phil Whitehead on loan from Barnsley, signed striker John Byrne (\u00a350,000 from Millwall) for the third time in his career, and then made what he later said was the best signing of his career by bringing in defender Matt Elliott from Scunthorpe United for \u00a3170,000. Oxford were boosted by these arrivals and briefly exited the relegation zone, also claiming an FA Cup giant-killing over Leeds at Elland Road after Jim Magilton scored the winning goal in extra time. However, after the match Magilton moved to Southampton for a \u00a3600,000 fee. Oxford had struggled in the league during their FA Cup run and were 15 points short of safety with 16 matches to play, but were aided by \u00a360,000 signing Paul Moody, who, despite arriving in February 1994, managed to finish as the club's top-scorer with 12 goals in 15 appearances. His arrival kick-started the club's fightback, and Oxford closed the 15 points gap in just 9 matches. However, a difficult run-in left Oxford needing to beat Notts County on the last day of the season and hope results elsewhere went their way, and though they beat County their relegation rivals also claimed victories and Oxford were relegated."]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["Having successfully coached Fulham's reserve team in the Capital League, Adams moved into management, taking over from Ian Branfoot in March 1996 with the London club languishing in 91st place in the league pyramid.

He built his side on free transfers and small fees, installing belief and self-confidence in the players at his disposal rather than spending big money.
