The regiment returned to South Africa following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, during which he saw his first action. By the outbreak of the First World War he was in command of the regiment. He led them in two cavalry charges in the first months of the war; the second of these saw him receive multiple wounds, one of them from a lance, making him one of the last British casualties of that weapon. In November 1914 he was promoted to command 6th Cavalry Brigade, then in May 1916 came further promotion to command 21st Division. He retained that command for the rest of the war.\nPost-war, he was knighted in 1919, and went on to hold further command and administrative positions in the army. He was General Officer Commanding (GOC) Baluchistan, 1920\u201324; Military Secretary, 1926\u201327; and GOC Aldershot Command 1927\u201331, when he argued for the increased mechanisation of the army. He was then appointed Governor of Malta, and died shortly after resigning that office in 1936.\nDuring the early years of his military career Campbell was also a successful amateur National Hunt jockey, winning a number of major races; foremost amongst these was the Grand National of 1896, on The Soarer, which gave him his nickname in subsequent years (though his divisional staff referred to him as Barbara, for reasons now lost). He continued riding in military meets until the end of his army service. He was also a keen cricketer and polo player.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1936", "response": ["* March 12 \u2013 Sir David Campbell, British army general and Governor of Malta (b. 1869)"]}, {"page": "Grand National", "response": ["Although the number of amateurs remained high between the wars their ability to match their professional counterparts gradually receded. After the Second World War, it became rare for any more than four or five amateurs to take part in any given year. The last amateur rider to win the race is Marcus Armytage, who set the still-standing course record of 8:47.80, when winning on Mr. Frisk in 1990. By the 21st century, however, openings for amateur riders had become very rare with some years passing with no amateur riders at all taking part. Those that do in the modern era are most usually talented young riders who are often close to turning professional. In the past, such amateur riders would have been joined by army officers, such as David Campbell who won in 1896, and sporting aristocrats, farmers or local huntsmen and point to point riders, who usually opted to ride their own mounts. But all these genres of rider have faded out in the last quarter of a century with no riders of military rank or aristocratic title having taken a mount since 1982."]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1931", "response": ["*#David Campbell, Governor of Malta (1931\u20131936)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1932", "response": ["* Malta Colony \u2013 David Campbell, Governor of Malta (1931\u20131936)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1933", "response": ["* Malta Colony \u2013 David Campbell, Governor of Malta (1931\u20131936)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1934", "response": ["* Malta Colony \u2013 David Campbell, Governor of Malta (1931\u20131936)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1935", "response": ["* Malta Colony \u2013 David Campbell, Governor of Malta (1931\u20131936)"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors in 1936", "response": ["*#David Campbell, Governor of Malta (1931\u20131936)"]}, {"page": "Military Secretary (United Kingdom)", "response": ["*Lieutenant-General Sir David Campbell, 1926\u20131927"]}, {"page": "21st Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* 22 May 1916 Major-General David Campbell"]}, {"page": "David Campbell", "response": ["David Campbell may refer to:", "* David Campbell (Australian political scientist) (born 1961), Australian political scientist", "* David Campbell (poet) (1915\u20131979), Australian poet", "* David Campbell (painter) (born 1936), American realist painter", "*David Campbell (judge, born 1750) (1750\u20131812), territorial and state judge in North Carolina and Tennessee", "*David Campbell (legal academic) (born 1958), British legal academic", "*David Campbell (composer) (born 1948), Canadian-American musician and arranger", "*David Campbell (clarinetist) (born 1953), British classical clarinetist ", "*David Campbell (singer) (born 1973), Australian singer, stage actor and television presenter", "*David Campbell (Virginia politician) (1779\u20131859), Governor of Virginia, 1837\u20131840", "*David Campbell (Manitoba politician) (1870\u20131932), Manitoba Liberal Party leader", "*Sir David Campbell (MP) (1891\u20131963), Northern Irish politician", "*David Campbell (Australian politician) (born 1957), New South Wales Transport Minister", "*David Campbell (New Hampshire politician) (born 1957), New Hampshire House of Representatives", "*David Campbell (Northern Ireland politician, born 1965) (born 1965), Northern Ireland politician and businessman", "* David Campbell (American football) (1873\u20131949)", "* David Campbell (baseball), Negro league baseball player", "* David Campbell (athlete) (born 1960), Canadian Olympic middle-distance runner", "* David Campbell (footballer) (born 1965), Northern Irish footballer", "* David Campbell (Ninja Warrior) (born 1977), American athlete", "* Sir David Campbell (British Army officer) (1869\u20131936), British general and jockey, Governor of Malta", "* Sir David Campbell (pharmacologist) (1889\u20131978), Scottish physician and pharmacologist", "* David Campbell (admiral) (born 1945), Australian rear admiral, Deputy Chief of Navy", "* David Campbell (1912 fireboat), a fireboat built in 1912 for Oregon's Portland Fire and Rescue", "* David Campbell (1927 fireboat), a fireboat built in 1928 for Oregon's Portland Fire and Rescue"]}, {"page": "Battle of Bazentin Ridge", "response": ["The 9th (Scottish) Division (Major-General William Furse) and the 3rd Division (Major-General Aylmer Haldane) in XIII Corps were to attack on a line from the north-west corner of Bernafay Wood to Marlboro' Wood and needed to advance  to a line from Delville Wood to Longueval and Bazentin le Grand in the dark, to close up to the German front line.
