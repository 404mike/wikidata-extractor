After the grounding of his ships Gulnare and Wallaroo, for both of which he was held culpable, he turned his interest in photography from a serious hobby and part-time occupation to a profession. Sweet was a pioneer of Australian landscape photography as an art form, and kept abreast of technical advances in the medium.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Foelsche", "response": ["Foelsche learned much of the art and craft of photography during the years 1869\u20131871 from Samuel Sweet, captain of the schooner Gulnare, the Government supply vessel."]}, {"page": "Sweet (surname)", "response": ["* Samuel Sweet (1825\u20131886), English-Australian settler and photographer"]}, {"page": "S.
