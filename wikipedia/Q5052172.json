He established Barrhill, a model village, and after the failure of this colonial venture, he returned to Scotland. An unusually large man (he was over 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) tall), he is noted both as an innovative farmer and for having passed his time in the British House of Commons by knitting.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
