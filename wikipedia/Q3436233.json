With wealth and power came political controversy.  He emerged during the 1640s as a supporter of the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War, and became a colonel in the island\u2019s militia. As a result, when a royalist faction seized control of Barbados in 1650, James and William Drax were exiled from the island, along with other prominent parliamentarians.  They returned to London, where they lobbied the House of Commons to send an expedition to retake the island. In 1651, Drax sailed in the fleet designed to re-conquer Barbados, and he was part of the delegation that went ashore to negotiate the surrender of the island.N.

Restored to his estates and power, Drax once again took up a leading role in the governance of the colony. It is thought that Drax Hall, a seventeenth-century manor house in St. George parish Barbados, was ordered to be constructed by him and his brother during the 1650s.  He also played a role as patron of explorers of the North American coast, including Robert Sandford.Barber, Sarah, \"Power in the English Caribbean: the Proprietorship of Lord Willoughby of Parham\" in Roper, LH and Van Ruymbeke, B. \u201cConstructing Early Modern Empires: Proprietary Ventures in the Atlantic World, 1500-1750, Leiden: Brill 2007 p. 193 In 1658, Drax was rewarded for his loyalty with a knighthood from the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell.Mark Noble, Memoirs of the Protectoral-House of Cromwell, 2 vols.
