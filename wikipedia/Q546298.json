His text critical colleague Samuel Prideaux Tregelles wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the University of Glasgow,Tischendorf at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.", "The great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself editio viii; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from stereotype plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869\u201372 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the Vatican manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend Samuel Prideaux Tregelles."]}, {"page": "Falmouth, Cornwall", "response": ["* Samuel Prideaux Tregelles (1813 in Falmouth \u2013 1875) English biblical scholar, textual critic, and theologian."]}, {"page": "Wilhelm Gesenius", "response": ["Gesenius takes much of the credit for having freed Semitic philology from the trammels of theological and religious prepossession, and for inaugurating the strictly scientific (and comparative) method which has since been so fruitful. As an exegete he exercised a powerful influence on theological investigation. He may also be considered as a founder of Phoenician studies.\"Wilhelm Gesenius\", in Je m'appelle Byblos, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, H & D, 2005, p. 253. Gesenius was keenly aware of previous efforts at dictionaries of Biblical Hebrew (he  provided an extensive survey of Hebrew lexicography in the 1823 edition of his Hebrew lexicon for schoolsAn English translation of this essay, \"On the Sources of Hebrew Philology and Lexicography\", appears in The Biblical Repository, ed. by Edward Robinson, vol. 3, nr. 9 (Jan. 1833) pages 1-44.), and, compared to previous lexicons which had simply translated Hebrew expressions as whatever other versions (primarily the Septuagint and the Vulgate) had in the same verses, his own contribution to that field was the inclusion of insights obtained from the study of other languages, ancient and non-semitic.Edward Robinson, Bibliotheca Sacra or Tracts and Essays (1843, NYC) ch. 6, 'Biographical Notices of Gesenius and Nordheimer', page 369. From his extensive body of work, the products most familiar to modern English-speaking readers are his Hebrew Grammar, best represented by an English translation of the 28th German edition, published by Oxford University Press in 1910,Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar as edited and enlarged by E. Kautzsch, second English edition, translated and revised in accordance with the 28th German edition (1909) by A. E.
