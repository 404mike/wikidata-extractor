Following an early career with Norman Foster, where he worked for ten years, he established his own practice Richard Horden Associates in 1985, which became Horden Cherry Lee Architects in 1999.

Later he became teaching and research assistant at the institute of Professor Richard Horden at the Technical University of Munich until 2002. There he was teaching microarchitecture and initiated and led several design studios for  aerospace architecture, focusing on habitability on board the International Space Station, and on studies for future habitats on Mars together with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA. The students involved were able to test their prototypes in parabolic test flights at NASA Johnson Space Center. During the time at the Technical University of Munich Vogler published several papers about space architecture and submitted several prize-winning architectural competition entries. In 2003\u20132005 he worked as Guest Professor at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture in Copenhagen conducting research on prefabricated housing. In 2004 he taught at The University of Hong Kong. In 2005- 2006 he was part of the Concept House research group at the Delft University of Technology."]}, {"page": "Poole Museum", "response": ["Opened in 1989 and set in a 19th-century harbour warehouse, Poole Museum illustrates the story of the town and its people.

The tower, previously known as the Millennium Tower, was the winning design in an international competition to design a tower for the city centre of Glasgow. The original architectural design was by the architect Richard Horden, with engineering design by Buro Happold, but after commissioning the project was taken over by the Glasgow architects BDP. In the end the tower cost \u00a310 million.
