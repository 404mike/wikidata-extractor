The journalist and CEO of SANE, Marjorie Wallace, encouraged Charnley to keep a diary of his progress.Marjorie Wallace, 'Bryan Charnley', Telegraph Magazine, 7 December 1991 Charnley made the diary an integral part of the portraits using the text to explain the imagery he was using and to describe his existential state. The Self Portrait Series consists of seventeen paintings. There is debate as to whether the last painting is incomplete due to the presence of a date in the lower right corner.  Marjorie Wallace's article on Charnley's Self Portraits was published in the Telegraph Magazine in December 1991.
