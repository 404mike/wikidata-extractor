The film was based on the Marcel Pagnol play Topaze. Sellers portrayed an ex-schoolmaster in a small French town who turns to a life of crime to obtain wealth. The film and Sellers's directorial abilities received unenthusiastic responses from the public and critics, and Sellers rarely referred to it again. The same year, he starred in the Sidney Gilliat-directed Only Two Can Play, a film based on the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis. He was nominated for the Best British Actor award at the 16th British Academy Film Awards for his role as John Lewis, a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz (Mai Zetterling) and his long-suffering wife Jean (Virginia Maskell)."]}, {"page": "The Prisoner", "response": ["* Virginia Maskell"]}, {"page": "1968 in film", "response": ["*January 25 - Virginia Maskell, 31, British actress, Only Two Can Play, Virgin Island"]}, {"page": "1958 in film", "response": ["*Virgin Island, starring John Cassavetes, Virginia Maskell and Sidney Poitier (UK)"]}]}}
