He scored in his second game against Mexborough Town in the FA Cup on 3 November, and 2 days later in his League debut against Burton United. It was the joint worst season in English Football League history, Doncaster ending up bottom with just 8 points from 34 games and failing to be re-elected.\nHe then went to Denaby United in the Midland League for two seasons before joining Leeds City. Despite looking good in practice games, his form wasn't good and he was dropped after 11 games. At the end of the season he moved to Mexborough Town where he saw out his career back in the Midland League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denaby United F.C.", "response": ["*  Tommy Tompkins"]}, {"page": "Teddy Napoleon", "response": ["Teddy Napoleon's first professional engagement was with Lee Castle in 1933.
