After two years at Bishop Auckland, he was signed by Bolton Wanderers. Rarely used by Bolton, he was instead loaned out to Macclesfield Town, Scunthorpe United, Rochdale, and Preston North End, before he signed permanently with Port Vale in 2004. A regular in the first team at Vale, he left after three years to sign with Carlisle United. In 2009, he joined Darlington, but only spent one season at the club. In August 2010 he moved to Belgium to play one season with Olympic Charleroi, before he returned to England with Whitby Town a year later.

Foyle took over first team responsibilities at the club on 13 February 2004 after Brian Horton left by mutual consent, and the team narrowly missed out on a play-off place on goal difference at the end of the 2003\u201304 season. Following the end of the season, Foyle aimed to keep players at the club, but eventually lost top scorer Stephen McPhee and midfielder Marc Bridge-Wilkinson. The club also had to make massive cut backs due to having just come out of administration and when Steve Brooker (a player signed by Horton on Foyle's recommendation) was sold to Bristol City any chance of a play-off push was unlikely. Vale eventually finished 17th in a frustrating season where many players suffered injuries leaving the squad threadbare on more than one occasion. The next two seasons saw an increase in the playing budget as Vale got their house in order after administration and Foyle steered the side to 13th and 12th-place finishes in League One. Two cup runs to the 4th round of the FA Cup in 2005\u201306 and 4th round of the League Cup in 2006\u201307, coupled with the selling of players such as Chris Birchall and Billy Paynter saw the club make a profit on the financial front. He also signed striker Akpo Sodje from Darlington, who would be sold on to Sheffield Wednesday for a reported \u00a3300,000 a year later. Showing a talent for signing attackers, he bought striker Leon Constantine for \u00a320,000 from Torquay United, who would hit 26 goals in the 2006\u201307 season; attacking midfielder Danny Whitaker from Macclesfield Town, who would have a long and successful career; and winger Jeff Smith, who impressed enough to win a \u00a360,000 transfer to Carlisle United."]}, {"page": "Adam Boyd", "response": ["After his release from Hartlepool, Boyd was linked with Bury and local Conference professional side Gateshead, the latter of whom made an offer for Boyd before he signed for Carlisle based Northern League side Celtic Nation.

Cassidy was replaced by ex-Sunderland stalwart Darren Williams who had only joined the club in August as a player. Williams quickly moved to bring back players who left during Cassidy's reign- popular local lad Ashley Lyth and two-time top goalscorer from midfield, Jimmy Beadle- plus he also brought in experienced strikers Andy Appleby and Jamie Clarke to bolster a struggling forward line, alongside ex-Bolton winger Jeff Smith.

After helping Carlisle to gain their second successive promotion up to League One. During Carlisle's first season in league one Hackney was only able to make 18 appearances this was due to him picking up a serious injury to his knee cartilage in December, however in these 18 games he did manage to score two goals. Hackney managed to recover from his knee injury in time for the 2007\u201308 season which enabled him to make himself a key part of the team which led to him making 45 league appearances for the club scoring eight times including a vital goal to help Carlisle end Leeds United's undefeated start to the season and help them defeat Leeds 3\u20131. During the first half of the 2008\u201309 season he made 22 appearances for Carlisle but only managed to score one goal against Crewe Alexandra, however towards the middle of the season his form dropped slightly and Jeff Smith took his place in the starting line up. Colchester United made two enquires which were both rejected after one reportedly being \u00a325,000 being called 'a mickey take', then Colchester came back with an improved 'six-figure' offer which Carlisle accepted on 26 January.
