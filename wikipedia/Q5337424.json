On hearing of the rebellion, Despenser acted swiftly, moving through Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk from his home in Burley, Rutland. His armed force initially consisted of his personal retinue, but grew as he was joined by knights and other men who had previously not dared to confront the rebels. According to the historian Edgar Powell, Dispenser undertook the task of dealing with the revolt in his diocese and punishing the rebels. He was involved in crushing rebellions at Peterborough and elsewhere, before moving on to suppress the revolts in Cambridge. The authorities were alerted to the call in Norfolk for men to join Litster's rebellion. On 17 June rebels from the north and east of the county assembled on Mousehold Heath outside Norwich: shortly afterwards, Sir Robert Salle, who had come out of the city to speak with the commons, was killed. According to Walsingham, the knight died soon after he was 'knocked on the head by a rustic who was one of his own serfs'. The rebels then entered Norwich and wreaked havoc, destroying property and killing prominent citizens. Other houses and church properties within the county (such as at Yarmouth) were attacked by the rebels at this time."]}]}}
