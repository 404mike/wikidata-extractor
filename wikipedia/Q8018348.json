Some historians, including Michael Ignatieff, Adam Jones and Greg Grandin, have cited the United States intervention and bombing campaign (spanning 1965\u20131973) as a significant factor which lead to increased support for the Khmer Rouge among the Cambodian peasantry.Kiernan, Ben (Winter 1989). \"The American Bombardment of Kampuchea 1969\u20131973\". Vietnam Generation. 1 (1): 4\u201341. According to Ben Kiernan, the Khmer Rouge \"would not have won power without U.S. economic and military destabilization of Cambodia.\u00a0...

Apparently spontaneously, Nixon then offered him the ambassadorship to the Soviet Union. After shortly considering it, Helms declined, wary of the potential consequences of the offer, considering his career in intelligence. \"I'm not sure how the Russians might interpret my being sent across the lines as an ambassador,\" Helms remembers telling Nixon. Instead Helms proposed being sent to Iran.Helms (2003) pp. 411\u2013412 (quote).Weiner (2007) pp. 322\u2013323. Nixon assented. Among other things Nixon perhaps figured Helms, after managing CIA's long involvement in Iranian affairs, would be capable in addressing issues arising out of Nixon's recent policy decision conferring on the shah his new role as \"policeman of the Gulf\".Cf., William Shawcross, The Shah's Last Ride: The Fate of an Ally; (New York: Simon and Schuster 1988) pp. 155\u2013165, regarding Nixon's 1972 visit to Tehran to see the Shah, and increased American arms sales to him (role quote at 168); and p. 266, re CIA's presence in Iran to gather intelligence on the Soviet military.Powers (1979) pp. 309\u2013312, speculates about Nixon. Although angry that Helms in June had refused him cover over Watergate, by December Nixon looked like he would escape the scandal. Yet Nixon sensed that Helms could still help or hurt him. So Nixon offered him an ambassadorship to get him out of town while not making him a permanent enemy (p. 312).", "After Helms left the leadership of the CIA, he began his service as U.S. ambassador to Iran as designated by President Nixon.See above subsection \"Helms dismissed\" under section \"Nixon Presidency\". Helms served in Iran under both Nixon and Ford.Cf., Nixon White House Tapes January 1973, Nixon Presidential Library & Museum, released on 23 Jun 2009. This recording apparently presents a telephone conversation between Nixon and Helms, evidently in January 1973, after his ambassadorial appointment but before his leaving for Iran. This had caused the dismissal of the then current ambassador, Joseph Farland.William Shawcross, The Shah's Last Ride: The Fate of an Ally (New York: Simon and Schuster 1988) pp. 265\u2013266 *note. After being confirmed by the Senate, in April 1973 Helms proceeded to his new residence in Tehran, where he served as the American representative until resigning effective January 1977. During these years, however, his presence was often required in Washington, where he testified before Congress in hearings about past CIA activities, including Watergate. His frequent flights to America lessened somewhat his capacity to attend to being ambassador.Powers (1979) p. 341.William Shawcross, The Shah's Last Ride: The Fate of an Ally (New York: Simon and Schuster 1988) p. 267 *note: \"Much of Helms' time in Iran was devoured by trips to Washington to testify to one or another of the various congressional committees investigating the CIA.\"  Note: this entry is strangely missing details of the assassination attempt upon Richard Helms in Tehran while he was ambassador--it is surely noteworthy?", "British author and journalist William Shawcross several times makes the point that the shah prohibited foreign governments from any contact with his domestic political opposition. Replying to one such request for access, by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, an 'irritated' shah replied \"I will not have any guest of mine waste a moment on these ridiculous people.\" As with other ambassadors before and during his tenure, Helms was reluctant to cross the shah on this point because of the fear of \"being PNG'ed (made persona non grata).\" For any ambassador to do so \"would at the very least have jeopardized his country's export opportunities in Iran.\" Consequently, \"American and other diplomats swam in a shallow pool of courtiers, industrialists, lawyers, and others who were somehow benefiting from the material success of the regime. \u00b6 ... people more or less licensed by the Shah.\" About the immediate court, however, a U.N. official wrote, \"There was an atmosphere of overwhelming nouveau-riche, meretricious chi-chi and sycophancy ...\"Shawcross, The Shah's Last Ride: The Fate of an Ally (Simon and Schuster 1988) pp. 264\u2013265 (no contact with opposition), p. 270 (Shah \"guest\" quote); p. 265 (\"jeopardized\" quote, \"shallow pool\" quote), p. 268 (Helms' \"PNG\" quote), p. 271 (U.N.'s Brian Urquhart's quote).Azimi, The Quest for Democracy in Iran (Harvard Univ. 2008, 2010) p. 285: \"In the twilight years of the monarchy it was increasingly clear that the shah and his elite had cacooned themselves in an impenetrable web of collective self-deception.\" Helms himself managed to circulate widely among the traditional elites, e.g., becoming a \"close friend\" of the aristocrat Ahmad Goreishi.Abbas Milani, The Shah (Palgrave Macmillan 2011) p. 386.", "Helms articulated several understandings, derived from his working knowledge and experiences as ambassador in Iran. \"He came to realize that he could never understand the Iranians,\" writes William Shawcross. He quotes Helms, \"They have a very different turn of mind. Here would be ladies, dressed in Parisian clothes. ... But before they went on trips abroad, they would ship up to Mashhad in chadors to ask for protection.\" Helms with his wife had visited the pilgrimage site in Mashhad, 'the tomb of the eighth Imam'. As to the shah's statecraft, Helms' May 1976 memo observes, \"Iranian government and society are highly structured and authoritarian and all major decisions are made at the top. Often even relatively senior officials are not well informed about policies and plans and have little influence on them.\"Shawcross, The Shah's Last Ride (1988) at 267 (\"Mashhad\" quote), 267\u2013268 (travel to Mashhad); at 269 (\"authoritarian\" quote). In July 1976 Helms send a message to the U.S. Department of State which, while confident, again voiced various concerns, e.g., about the \"inadequate 'political institutionalization'\" of the regime.Azimi, The Quest for Democracy in Iran (Harvard Univ. 2008, 2010) at 353. Professor Abbas Milani comments that in 1975 Helms had \"captured the nature of the shah's vulnerability when he wrote that 'the conflict between rapid economic growth and modernization vis-\u00e0-vis a still autocratic rule' was the greatest uncertainty about the shah's future.\" Milani, looking ahead after Helms' departure, writes that the election of President Carter in 1976 \"forced the Shah to expedite his liberalization plans.\"Milani, The Shah (Palgrave Macmillan 2011) p. 375.Cf., above section \"Iran: Mossadegh\" regarding Helms's reflections on the CIA and the Islamic revolution in Iran.", "In the years following his retirement from government service in 1977, Helms was interviewed many times.

The CIA's 1982\u201384 sessions conducted by Agency historian Robert M.
