Early copyright law had begun to undercut the Stationers, and the university took pains to lease out its Bible work to experienced printers. When the American War of Independence deprived Oxford of a valuable market for its Bibles, this lease became too risky a proposition, and the Delegates were forced to offer shares in the Press to those who could take \"the care and trouble of managing the trade for our mutual advantage.\" Forty-eight shares were issued, with the university holding a controlling interest.Sutcliffe p. xxv At the same time, classical scholarship revived, with works by Jeremiah Markland and Peter Elmsley, as well as early 19th-century texts edited by a growing number of academics from mainland Europe\u00a0\u2013 perhaps the most prominent being August Immanuel Bekker and Karl Wilhelm Dindorf.

During his time, the growing Press established distributors in London, and employed the bookseller Joseph Parker in Turl Street for the same purposes in Oxford.
