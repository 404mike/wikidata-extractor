He took holy orders and was an assistant-master at Merchant Taylors' School from 1857-70.  He subsequently served as headmaster of Henley-on-Thames Royal Grammar School from 1870\u201373, and then of King Edward VI School, Retford from 1873-80. From 1880 until 1888 he was professor of Latin at University College, London.\nWhile at University College in partnership with William Jackson Brodribb, he translated Tacitus and edited Pliny's Letters (Epistulae). Church also wrote a number of stories in English re-telling of classical tales and legends for young people (Stories from Virgil, Stories from Homer, etc.). He also wrote much Latin and English verse, and in 1908 published his Memories of Men and Books.

He was given instructions to keep nearby Cappadocia loyal to King Ariobarzanes III, which he achieved 'satisfactorily without war'. In 53 BC Marcus Licinius Crassus had been defeated by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae. This opened up the Roman East for a Parthian invasion, causing much unrest in Syria and Cilicia. Cicero restored calm by his mild system of government. He discovered that a great amount of public property had been embezzled by corrupt previous governors and members of their staff, and did his utmost to restore it. Thus he greatly improved the condition of the cities.Alfred John Church, Roman Life in the Days of Cicero, (Kindle edition), ch. XIII., loc. 1834 He retained the civil rights of, and exempted from penalties, the men who gave the property back.Church, loc. 1871 Besides this, he was extremely frugal in his outlays for staff and private expenses during his governorship, and this made him highly popular among the natives.Church, loc. 1834 Previous governors had extorted enormous sums from the provincials in order to supply their households and bodyguards."]}, {"page": "Hyrcania", "response": ["* Tacitus (1876).
