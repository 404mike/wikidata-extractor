Although he raced in Formula One, he never participated in a World Championship event. He was the son of the Conservative politician Spencer Summers.\nIn 1960, Summers had a successful season racing a Lotus 15 sports car prepared by Terry Bartram, and for the following season, he and Bartram decided to enter Formula One with a new Cooper T53, chassis number F1-8-61.At the season opener, the non-Championship Lombank Trophy, 24-year-old Summers qualified tenth of the 14 runners, and finished eighth and last. The following week he crashed out of the Glover Trophy after again qualifying tenth. Travelling to Europe for the next two races, he was refused a start at the 1961 Brussels Grand Prix despite posting the 12th fastest time in qualifying, but started from the front row at the Vienna Grand Prix. From second on the grid, he ran near the front until his suspension failed.\nReturning to the UK, Summers entered the Aintree 200, qualifying 13th of 28 starters, and finishing 12th. A month later he achieved his best result, finishing fourth in the London Trophy. However, during practice in the rain for the Silver City Trophy race at Brands Hatch, Summers was killed when he spun at Paddock Hill Bend and crashed into a concrete wall at the pit tunnel entrance.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1961 Formula One season", "response": ["Besides von Trips, two other drivers died during this season: Briton Shane Summers during the non-championship Silver City Trophy event at Brands Hatch, and Italian Giulio Cabianca during a test at the Modena Autodrome.", "The London Trophy was held at the short, tight and twisty Crystal Palace circuit in London the day after the Dutch Grand Prix, and it was won by Salvadori driving a Yeoman Credit Cooper, whilst another English race, the Silver City Trophy at the undulating and twisty Brands Hatch circuit nearby Crystal Palace was held in wet conditions and was won by Moss in a Walker Lotus, but was marred by the death of 24-year-old Welshman Shane Summers in a Cooper, who was killed almost instantly when he spun at the challenging, anti-cambered Paddock Hill Bend, went off and crashed into a concrete wall near an underground tunnel entrance."]}, {"page": "1961 Glover Trophy", "response": ["|  Shane Summers"]}, {"page": "1961 Silver City Trophy", "response": ["The race was overshadowed by a fatal accident during qualifying when Shane Summers crashed his Cooper T53 into the concrete entrance to the paddock road tunnel.", "|  Shane Summers"]}, {"page": "1961 London Trophy", "response": ["|  Shane Summers"]}, {"page": "1961 Vienna Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Shane Summers"]}, {"page": "1961 Aintree 200", "response": ["|  Shane Summers"]}, {"page": "1961 Lombank Trophy", "response": ["|  Shane Summers"]}, {"page": "1961 Brussels Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Shane Summers"]}]}}
