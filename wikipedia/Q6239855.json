He prepared a few based on their pronunciation of Inuktitut, but it quickly became obvious that the number of basic sounds and the simple model of the syllable in the Evans system was inadequate to the language.

The two versions differ primarily in the way they indicate syllable-final consonants, in how they mark the semi-vowel , and in how they reflect the phonological differences between Cree dialects.
