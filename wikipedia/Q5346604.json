He was born at Wellington, Somerset and died in the fighting of the First World War near Beaumont Hamel in France.\nIn his two first-class matches, Leat batted in the lower order and did not bowl. He scored just 18 runs in three innings, with a highest of 11 in the match against Kent in 1908. He played with some success as a middle-order batsman for Buckinghamshire in Minor Counties cricket between 1908 and 1911. It is not known whether he batted right- or left-handed, and he bowled a little for Buckinghamshire, but the bowling style is also unknown.\nLeat was a second lieutenant in the Dorsetshire Regiment when he was killed in the fighting on the Somme in 1918; he is commemorated at the Pozi\u00e8res memorial. At the time of his death, his widowed mother was living in Ottery St Mary, Devon and he left a wife, Winifred Emily, who lived at an address in Slough, then in Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Edwin Leat (1908\u20131910) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Edwin Leat"]}]}}
