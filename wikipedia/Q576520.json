On 29 October 2005, he scored from 40 yards at Sunderland's Stadium of Light, winning the BBC Goal of the Month. Spotting the goalkeeper Kelvin Davis off his line, Taylor hit a dipping left-footed half-volley over Davis' head and into the back of the net. Portsmouth had been trailing Sunderland 1\u20130 in the crucial \"six-pointer\" but Taylor inspired a second half comeback with two goals and two assists in a 4\u20131 victory. When Harry Redknapp returned, Taylor initially retained his attacking role but the arrival of Andr\u00e9s D'Alessandro on loan and Redknapp's disapproval of Perrin's left-back, Gr\u00e9gory Vignal, meant that Taylor returned to full-back for the latter stages of the season. 2005\u201306 could be considered Taylor's breakthrough season as a Premiership footballer. In all he played 34 league games, scoring six goals. Two of these were crucial penalties; one in the last minute against Sunderland to secure a 2\u20131 win, and another in an away game at Wigan Athletic on 29 April 2006 to clinch another 2\u20131 win and survival from relegation."]}, {"page": "Chris Baird", "response": ["In the first game of the 2006\u201307 season, away to Derby County on 6 August 2006, he was drafted into the centre half position when Claus Lundekvam went off injured in the sixth minute.
