The relative economic power of the club also means that players from the Central Belt are frequently persuaded to move north, and over the decades many of Aberdeen's successful youth products (not least Willie Miller, McLeish, Black, Leighton, McMaster and later Joe Miller, Phil McGuire, Diamond and Chris Maguire) have moved from the west of Scotland to begin their professional careers. In the 21st century Aberdeen have also looked further afield to the English lower leagues for academy recruits as well as senior players.", "*Phil McGuire"]}, {"page": "Maguire", "response": ["*Phil McGuire (field hockey) (born 1970), British former field hockey player", "*Phil McGuire (footballer) (born 1980), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 East Superleague", "response": ["| align=left | Phil McGuire", "| Carnoustie Panmure || Alan McSkimming || Resigned || 17 September 2018 ||  align=\"center\" position |7th  || Phil McGuire || 26 September 2018"]}]}}
