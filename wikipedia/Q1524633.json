Campbell was born in the British military hospital in Ismailia, Egypt, and lived in Kenya till 1962, so was exposed to indigenous Arab and African music before its alteration by western influence. He studied Stravinsky and formed the progressive rock band Egg in 1968 with Dave Stewart and Clive Brooks. In 1972 he studied composition at the Royal College of Music, gaining an ARCM diploma in 1974. He composed the score to David Anderson's BAFTA-winning animated film Dreamland Express in 1983 and began a full-time career as composer in 1989 with film and commercials commissions from Redwing Films. He has since written scores for film, television, advertising, radio and stage. He is adept on a wide range of ethnic folk instruments which have led to recording work in film, television and computer games. He has created or contributed to several instrumental sound libraries (production music) distributed by ILIO Entertainments, World Winds, Origins, Music House, SOHO, Production Music Online, and others.\nAlthough initially known as a member of progressive rock bands such as Egg and National Health, Campbell would later (in his own words) \"(forswear) the genre of rock music altogether, and began to develop an interest in folk tradition and, increasingly, non-western music.\" Originally a bass guitarist, he is now a multi-instrumentalist specialising in wind instruments from around the world, including period folk instruments. \nIn parallel to his work as a musician, Campbell is a director of the Sussex-based alternative energy company, Ovesco.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Mont Campbell"]}, {"page": "Steve Hillage", "response": ["Hillage was born in Chingford, which was then in Essex but is now part of Greater London.

After a residency on the Isle of Wight in the summer of 1968, Hillage left the group to go to university. Uriel continued as a trio, later changed their name to Egg and subsequently recorded two albums for Decca.

Having signed a deal with the Middle Earth club's management branch, they were advised to change their name to Egg, allegedly because Uriel \"sounded too much like 'urinal'\". In mid-1969 the band signed a deal with Decca's 'progressive' music subsidiary Deram and released their debut album in March 1970. While not a commercial success, it was received well enough for the label to finance the recording of a follow-up, but when the time came to release it, the label shelved it until producer Neil Slaven's lobbying finally resulted in The Polite Force coming out in February 1971.

After signing with Decca in mid-1969 the band evolved into a hard-working live unit who won many fans on their travels round the UK.
