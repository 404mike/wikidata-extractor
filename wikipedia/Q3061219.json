He played collegiate golf in the United States at East Tennessee State University where he won ten times and was a first team All-American in 2005, 2006, and 2007. He played on two Walker Cup teams (2005 and 2007), and for Europe in four Palmer Cup teams (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007). Davies was second in the World Amateur Golf Ranking (May 2007), before turning pro in September 2007.\nDavies successfully came through the Asian Tour's qualifying school, allowing him to play on that tour for the 2008 season.\nDavies won twice on the Challenge Tour in 2009 and finished fourth on the Challenge Tour Rankings to earn his European Tour card for 2010. He won his first European Tour title at the 2010 Troph\u00e9e Hassan II. At the 2010 Celtic Manor Wales Open, he shot a final round 62 to set the course record on his way to finishing as runner-up. This performance elevated Davies into the top 50 of the Official World Golf Ranking for the first time. He finished the season ranked 18th on the European Tour Order of Merit. After a poor 2012 season, Davies narrowly failed to maintain his full playing rights for the 2013 season.\nDavies earned his first professional win in five years at the 2015 Turkish Airlines Challenge, and followed this three months later with victory at the Challenge de Espana, when he opened with a first round 60. These successes helped Davies secure eighth position on the Challenge Tour order of merit, and full European Tour status. \nTo date Davies has played 314 tournaments (5 wins; 9 second; 8 third and 43 top ten places); 981 rounds; 70,165 strokes; 71.52 stroke average. These include 170 European Tour tournaments (1 win; 4 second; 2 third and 12 top ten places), and 6 Majors (Oakmont; Turnberry; Pebble Beach; St Andrews; Whistling Straits; and Royal St Georges).\nAt sixteen Davies had to chose between cricket and golf. At this time he was a Glamorgan CC Academy, and ECB England National Development Squad player. The latter also included Alistair Cook, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan and Samit Patel who would play Test cricket subsequently.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bridgend", "response": ["* Rhys Davies (European Tour golfer)"]}, {"page": "East Tennessee State University", "response": ["* Rhys Davies, European Tour golfer (2010\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Jyoti Randhawa", "response": ["| Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "Luke Donald", "response": ["| Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "Thongchai Jaidee", "response": ["| Rhys Davies,  Andrew Dodt", "| Rhys Davies,  Andrew Dodt"]}, {"page": "Rhys", "response": ["* Rhys Davies (born 1985), Welsh golfer"]}, {"page": "Wales Open", "response": ["| align=center|2010 ||  Graeme McDowell || align=center|269 || align=center|\u221215 || 3 strokes ||  Rhys Davies || align=center|2,118,254 || align=center|350,940"]}, {"page": "Graeme McDowell", "response": ["| Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "Volvo China Open", "response": ["| align=center|2010 || EUR, ONE || Yang Yong-eun|| align=\"center\" |273 || align=center|\u221215 || 2 strokes ||  Rhys Davies Stephen Dodd|| Suzhou Jinji Lake"]}, {"page": "2006 in Wales", "response": ["*2 November \u2013 Golf: The team of Rhys Davies, Nigel Edwards and Llewellyn Matthews takes Wales to fourth place at the World Amateur Team Championships in Stelle."]}, {"page": "Jacques L\u00e9glise Trophy", "response": ["| align=\"center\"|2002 || Golf Club de Lausanne, Switzerland || align=\"right\"|Great Britain  & Ireland   Rhys Davies  || align=\"center\"|14 || align=\"center\"|10 ||  Continent of Europe  Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez-Casta\u00f1o  || ", "*2003 Wallace Booth, Rhys Davies, Daniel Denison, Tommy Hunter, Cian McNamara, Aaron O'Callaghan, Lloyd Saltman, Gareth Shaw, Paul Waring", "*2002 Clancy Bowe, Rhys Davies, Farren Keenan, Jamie Moul, Mark Pilling, Matthew Richardson, Gareth Shaw, Michael Skelton, Paul Waring"]}, {"page": "St Andrews Trophy", "response": ["*  Rhys Davies 2006"]}, {"page": "2007 U.S. Open (golf)", "response": [":*Rockville, Maryland: Rhys Davies (a), Fred Funk, Luke List, Philip Pettitt Jr. (a), Joey Sindelar, Martin Ureta (a)"]}, {"page": "Yang Yong-eun", "response": ["| Rhys Davies,  Stephen Dodd", "| Rhys Davies,  Stephen Dodd"]}, {"page": "Rhys Davies", "response": ["Rhys Davies may refer to:", "*Rhys Davies (writer) (1901\u20131978), Welsh novelist and short story writer", "*Rhys Davies (engineer) (died 1838), American engineer in Richmond, Virginia associated with the Tredegar Iron Works", "*Rhys Davies (politician), British Labour Member of Parliament for Westhoughton from 1921 to 1951", "*Rhys Davies (golfer) (born 1985), Welsh golfer", "*Rhys Davies (canoeist), British slalom canoeist", "*Rhys Davies (rugby union, born February 1998), Welsh rugby union player", "*John Rhys Davies (priest) (1890\u20131953), Welsh priest"]}, {"page": "Hassan II Golf Trophy", "response": ["| Rhys Davies Jaco van Zyl", "| Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "Andrew Dodt", "response": ["| Rhys Davies,  Thongchai Jaidee"]}, {"page": "Nicolas Colsaerts", "response": ["| Rhys Davies,  Julien Guerrier", "| Rhys Davies,  Julien Guerrier"]}, {"page": "Wales Challenge", "response": ["| 2009 ||  Rhys Davies || align=center|286 || align=center|\u22122 || Playoff ||  James Morrison || The Vale Resort"]}, {"page": "Challenge de Espa\u00f1a", "response": ["| 2015 ||  Rhys Davies || align=center|262 || align=center|\u221222 || 2 strokes ||  Geoff Drakeford || Tecina Golf", "| 2009 ||  Rhys Davies || align=center|267 || align=center|\u221217 || 1 stroke ||  Steven Jeppesen || Tecina Golf"]}, {"page": "Open de Bretagne", "response": ["| 2013 || CHA ||  Andrea Pavan || align=center|269 || align=center|\u221211 || 4 strokes ||  Rhys Davies Robert Dinwiddie"]}, {"page": "2007 Walker Cup", "response": ["| Rhys Davies", "|Rhys Davies", "|Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "2005 Walker Cup", "response": ["* Rhys Davies", "|Rhys Davies", "|Rhys Davies"]}, {"page": "Hana Bank Vietnam Masters", "response": ["| 2008 ||  Thongchai Jaidee || align=center|273 || align=center|\u221215 || Playoff ||  Rhys Davies Andrew Dodt"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Rhys Davies||1985\u2013"]}, {"page": "East Tennessee State Buccaneers", "response": ["Notable ETSU golfers include Eric Axley, Rhys Davies, David Eger, Larry Hinson, Mike Hulbert, Keith Nolan, J.
