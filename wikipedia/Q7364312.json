This was the first time that the Beatles had permitted a camera crew to film them developing a song in the studio. The film shows only three of the Beatles performing \"Hey Jude\", as George Harrison remained in the studio control room, with Martin and EMI recording engineer Ken Scott. During the rehearsals that day, Harrison and McCartney had a heated disagreement over the lead guitar part for the song. Harrison's idea was to play a guitar phrase as a response to each line of the vocal, which did not fit with McCartney's conception of the song's arrangement, and he vetoed it. Author Simon Leng views this as indicative of how Harrison was increasingly allowed little room to develop ideas on McCartney compositions, whereas he was free to create empathetic guitar parts for Lennon's songs of the period. In a 1994 interview, McCartney said, \"looking back on it, I think, Okay. Well, it was bossy, but it was ballsy of me, because I could have bowed to the pressure.\" Ron Richards, a record producer who worked for Martin at both Parlophone and AIR Studios, said McCartney was \"oblivious to anyone else's feelings in the studio\", and that he was driven to making the best possible record, at almost any cost."]}, {"page": "Andy White (drummer)", "response": ["In September 1962, White received a call from producer Ron Richards asking him to attend a Beatles recording session at the EMI Studios at Abbey Road in London.

Richards offered them an audition with Parlophone, but Steele did not want to be a \"professional\" musician and left the band in April 1963. For the audition, they brought in Tony Hicks to replace the departing Steele. Hicks played in a Nelson band called the Dolphins, which also featured Bobby Elliott on drums and Bernie Calvert on bass. Not only were the Hollies signed by Richards, who continued to produce the band until 1976 and once more in 1979, but a song from the audition, a cover of the Coasters' 1961 single \"(Ain't That) Just Like Me\", was released as their debut single in May 1963 and hit No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart.", "In addition to his Hollies work, Graham Nash co-wrote John Walker's first solo hit \"Annabella\" in 1967, and the following year sang on the Scaffold's UK chart-topper, \"Lily the Pink\" (which referenced \"Jennifer Eccles\"). The failure of \"King Midas in Reverse\" had increased tension within the band, with Clarke and Hicks wanting to record more \"pop\" material than Nash did. Matters reached a head when the band rejected Nash's \"Marrakesh Express\" and then decided to record an album made up entirely of Bob Dylan covers. Nash did take part in one Dylan cover, \"Blowin' in the Wind\", but made no secret of his disdain for the idea and repeatedly clashed with producer Ron Richards.", "Like Graham Nash before him, frontman Allan Clarke by 1971 was growing frustrated, and he too began clashing with producer Ron Richards over material; after seeing Nash's success since departing, he was eager to leave the group and cut a solo album. After the 1971 album Distant Light, which concluded the band's EMI/Parlophone contract in the UK (and reached No. 21 on the American Billboard chart), Clarke departed from the Hollies in December, a move which surprised both the band's fans and the public in general."]}, {"page": "Tony Hatch", "response": ["His production of The Searchers' entire Pye catalogue was significant in that nearly every song was issued in true stereo.

With Graham Nash and Allan Clarke keen to record the song, the Hollies accepted it as the follow-up to their recent hit \"Look Through Any Window\". The group recorded their version in three takes on 17 November 1965, in the same studio as the Beatles.
