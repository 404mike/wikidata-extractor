In 2007 he became the High Sheriff of the West Midlands.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tiswas", "response": ["It was created by ATV continuity announcer Peter Tomlinson (later to become a regular presenter on the show) following a test period in 1973 when he tried out a few competitions and \"daft stuff\" between the programmes.", "Series 2 of Tiswas began from late 1974, and spanned almost every Saturday in 1975, finishing in early 1976. The presenting team was doubled to four presenters, and these were usually culled from ATV's presentation department. Chris Tarrant and John Asher retained their roles as the main presenters, although John would leave during this series. From the ranks at ATV, other regular presenters were established, notably sports reporter Trevor East (later director of sport at Setanta Sports) and announcer Peter Tomlinson (later to become managing director of Saga Radio West Midlands and High Sheriff of the West Midlands).", "Running from late 1976 to early 1977, Chris Tarrant, Peter Tomlinson and Trevor East were the main presenters. Almost all these shows were produced by Sid Kilbey. The 2 April 1977 show was a landmark edition, as part of the programme was broadcast outside the Midlands for the first time, on HTV Cymru Wales and HTV West, filling up their 'round-the-regions' compilation of Saturday morning programmes called Ten on Saturday.", "This series, running from 10 September 1977 to May 1978, marked an end to the provincial micro-budget shows of the previous series, as the initial edition of this series brought significant changes. Sally James was drafted in as the series' first regular female presenter. She had been the presenter of a regional Saturday morning show in London called Saturday Scene, produced by LWT. Comedian Jim Davidson was intended to be a regular presenter but left after only a few editions, although he would return for cameo appearances. Peter Tomlinson was axed as a regular, which came as a surprise to him."]}, {"page": "Rozz Williams", "response": ["Williams, Eva, Listo (bass) and David Melford (drums) started recording new versions of Christian Death songs for The Iron Mask album in February 1992.

Peter Tomlinson had replaced Tom Morgan on drums for this tour."]}, {"page": "Shadow Project", "response": ["The band's self-titled first album was released in 1991. AllMusic described Shadow Project's debut as a unique and adventurous \"blend of goth, punk and glam\", a challenging record that would ultimately prove satisfying after several spins. With Peter Tomlinson replacing Morgan, the group completed a follow-up, Dreams for the Dying, recorded during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
