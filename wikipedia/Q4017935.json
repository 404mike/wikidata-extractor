He married Helen Varey in 1913, and his first daughter was born only six weeks before his departure on the Endurance.\nWhen the Endurance made a stop at Buenos Aires en route to the Antarctica, How, along with William Bakewell, helped smuggle Perce Blackborow on board as a stowaway. After the Endurance sank, trapped in the sea ice around Antarctica, How was forced to survive upon the icebergs along with the rest of the crew.  When they later used the three wooden lifeboats to row to Elephant Island, How was in the Stancomb Wills.\nOn return to England after their eventual rescue, How was awarded the Polar Medal and joined the Merchant Navy during the Great War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Endurance (1912 ship)", "response": ["* Walter How, Able Seaman"]}, {"page": "Perce Blackborow", "response": ["Blackborow and his friend, William Lincoln Bakewell, travelled to Buenos Aires looking for new employment.

Fearing that Endurance was shorthanded, Bakewell and Walter How helped Blackborow sneak aboard, and hid him in a locker amongst piles of clothing.NOVA Online | Shackleton's Antarctic Odyssey | Perce Blackborow, Steward On the third day at sea, once there was no reasonable possibility of turning back, the stowaway was discovered."]}, {"page": "Personnel of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["| Walter How"]}]}}
