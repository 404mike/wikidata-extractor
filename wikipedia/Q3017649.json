At the time of their closure, they were the last college-based science laboratories at the university. They were named the Sir Leoline Jenkins laboratories, after a former principal of the college.  Scientific research and tuition (particularly in chemistry) became an important part of the college's academic life after the construction of the laboratories. The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years, and that provision of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates, as well as attracting to Jesus College those graduates of the University of Wales who wished to continue their research at Oxford.  One of the college science lecturers had a link with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI); 17 students joined ICI between the two World Wars, some of whom (such as John Rose) reached senior levels in the company.  The laboratories became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students, and they were closed in 1947."]}, {"page": "David Leonard Chapman", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Chapman (chemist)"]}, {"page": "David Chapman (scientist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Chapman (chemist)"]}, {"page": "Muriel Chapman", "response": ["Muriel Catherine Canning Chapman (16 September 1894 \u2013 23 March 1988) was a British chemist.
