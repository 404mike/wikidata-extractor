Although it was ruled a case of accidental death, there are grounds for believing that he had been killed at Ley's behest; by this time Ley was already suspected of having done away with his federal predecessor Frederick McDonald (who disappeared in 1926) and with Keith Greedor, a business associate who had drowned in 1928 after having launched an investigation into Ley's business practices.
