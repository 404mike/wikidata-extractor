The actors perform flawlessly even when the staging is too pedestrian for the ideas being expressed, and when the film's flat, uninflected style allows some of those ideas to be overlooked or thrown away ... Mr. Sturridge's assault on his material is strictly frontal, with a screenplay ... that adequately summarizes the novel but rarely approaches its depth. Although the film stumbles unimaginatively over some of Forster's more elaborate scenes ... and although it moves gracelessly back and forth between Italy and England, its most significant lapse is visual. Tuscany, as photographed by Michael Coulter, is never as ravishing as it deserves to be either for strictly scenic purposes or for illustrating Forster's view of Italy's magnetic allure. Even so, the material and the performances often rise above these limitations. At its occasional best, Where Angels Fear to Tread even captures the transcendent aspects of Forster's tale.\"The New York Times review"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography", "response": ["| Sense and Sensibility || Michael Coulter "]}, {"page": "List of films shot on digital video prior to 2015", "response": ["|Michael Coulter"]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["|Michael Coulter"]}, {"page": "List of accolades received by Sense and Sensibility (film)", "response": ["| Michael Coulter", "| Michael Coulter", "| Michael Coulter"]}, {"page": "U.S. Junior Figure Skating Championships", "response": ["| 2003 || Lake Placid, New York || Madison Hubbell / Keiffer Hubbell || Emily Blynn / Geoffrey Drayton || Lauren Wlazelek / Kyle Herring || Charlotte Maxwell / Michael Coulter"]}, {"page": "Coulter (surname)", "response": ["* Michael Coulter (born 1952), Scottish cinematographer "]}, {"page": "Mick Coulter", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Coulter"]}, {"page": "Jack Coulter", "response": ["He is the cousin of Academy Award nominated cinematographer Michael Coulter."]}, {"page": "Coulter, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Coulter"]}, {"page": "British Society of Cinematographers Award for Best Cinematography in a Theatrical Feature Film", "response": ["| Four Weddings and a Funeral || Michael Coulter", "| Sense and Sensibility || Michael Coulter"]}, {"page": "List of European Academy Award winners and nominees", "response": ["| Michael Coulter"]}]}}
