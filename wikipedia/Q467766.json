The musical features strong female protagonists living in a strong female-power community. The theme of single motherhood breaks the family stereotype of a child being raised by both parents by showing a different perspective of a family raised single-handedly by a mother, to show that there can still be happiness and love. Having Donna, her two good friends and her daughter, Sophie as the main strong female characters of the musical, it can be seen as an empowerment for women as it celebrates and caters to the rise in liberation of female in the society, female sexuality,Rodosthenous, George (2016). \"Mamma Mia!

Librettist Catherine Johnson manages to express these themes through her transformation of ABBA's music, as she turns these somewhat stereotypical songs into empowering ones by having characters of different genders sing them.Womack, Malcolm (2009). \"\u2018Thank You For the Music\u2019: Catherine Johnson's feminist revoicings in Mamma Mia!\", Studies in Musical Theatre, 3(2), p. 201.", "* Malcom Womack: Thank You For the Music: Catherine Johnson's feminist revoicings in Mamma Mia!.
