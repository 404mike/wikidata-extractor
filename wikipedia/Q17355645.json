She heard the alarm of fire and came to the door (or window) where egress awaited but returned for a dress or to secure the receipts of the house for the last two nights, which were in her charge. She died of smoke inhalation. Her body was burnt with little remaining for burial. Her surname, which appeared as \"Woodham\" in the Gentleman's Magazine, was given in the Monthly Mirror as \"Woodman\", and it was noted that a similar actress named \"Mrs Woodman\" may have been the decedent.There was an actress \"from England\" called Mrs Woodham performing in Philadelphia in 1806 who was employed for her comical and musical skills.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Buck Spencer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mrs Woodham"]}, {"page": "Mrs. Woodham", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mrs Woodham"]}]}}
