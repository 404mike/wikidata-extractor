Karina's role was as an unattached striptease dancer who nevertheless wishes to have a child and daydreams about appearing in MGM musicals. Her school-girl costume emulated Leslie Caron in Gigi (1958), worn even while performing her act. Karina won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival for her performance. In all, Karina appeared in eight films directed by Godard, including My Life to Live (, 1962), Band of Outsiders (, 1964)  and Alphaville (both 1965). In , Karina's character is on the run with her ex-boyfriend, while in Alphaville, a science-fiction film often equated to Bladerunner, Karina's role requires her to have difficulty saying the phrase \"I love you.\" The last film in the sequence was Made in USA (1966).  Anne Billson, in an article querying the concept of the female muse, wrote that Godard in his films with Karina \"seems to have trouble conceiving that the female experience revolves around anything other than prostitution, duplicity, or wanting babies.\" Karina herself did not object to being described as Godard's muse: \"Maybe it's too much, it sounds so pompous. But of course I\u2019m always very touched to hear people say that.

Composers of note include Morricone,  Bruno Nicolai, and the Italian band Goblin.

Allen cast her opposite Jackman and himself in the film Scoop (2006), in which she played a journalism student. The film was a modest worldwide box office success, but polarized critics. Ebert was critical of the film, but found Johansson \"lovely as always\", and Mick LaSalle noted the freshness she brought to her part. She also appeared in Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia, a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria. Johansson later said she was a fan of DePalma and had wanted to work with him on the film, but thought that she was unsuitable for the part. Anne Billson of The Daily Telegraph likewise found her miscast. However, CNN said that she \"takes to the pulpy period atmosphere as if it were oxygen\".", "Johansson played Black Widow in Jon Favreau's Iron Man 2 (2010), a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Before she secured the role, she dyed her hair red to convince Favreau that she was right for the part, and undertook stunt and strength training to prepare for the role. Johansson said the character resonated with her, and she admired the superhero's human traits. The film earned $623.9million against its $200million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics, although reviewers criticized how her character was written. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph and Matt Goldberg thought that she had little to do but look attractive. In 2011, Johansson played the role of Kelly, a zookeeper in the family film We Bought a Zoo alongside Matt Damon. The film got mainly favorable reviews, and Anne Billson praised Johansson for bringing depth to a rather uninteresting character. Johansson earned a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Drama nomination for her performance."]}, {"page": "Satan's Slave (1976 film)", "response": ["Critic Adam Locks notes that Satan's Slave uses plot devices typical of 1970s horror films, including settings that amount to \"nowhere places\" where characters become lost. He argues that the effect of the Yorkes' car journey is comparable to time travel, defining it as a \"re-programming for the audience with memories and associations disconnected from the modern and the urban ... In psychogeographical terms of the relationship between the individual and space, there is the clich\u00e9d yet interesting idea of the road leading to nowhere.\" Locks also compares Satan's Slave, along with other Warren films, to the 1960s TV series The Avengers for the way that it conveys an \"underlying disquiet\" about its setting: \"Behind the fa\u00e7ade of mundane England, threatening figures or forces \u2013 be they crooks in The Avengers or Satanists in Satan's Slave ... \u2013 plan to disrupt the everyday world.\" He observes that through this sense of unease \"the familiarity of 'Englishness' is transformed and warped.\" He describes Alexander as an \"atavistic amalgamation of various icons of British gentlemen\" \u2013 among them the \"chivalrous knight\", whose moral code he inverts by sacrificing the women in his family. Warren felt that the character and his house were influenced by Hammer films. Anne Billson writes that the country house setting carries \"echoes of Hammer\", also stating that the film as a whole picks up where Hammer left off while \"amping up the nudity and gore\"."]}, {"page": "Douglas Booth", "response": ["Booth next played the role of Pip in the BBC One adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations (2011), alongside Gillian Anderson and Ray Winstone.
