The development of Garden Village began with the purchase of some  of land from Sir Foster Cunliffe near to the estate of Acton by the Welsh Town Planning and Housing Trust Limited.The Garden City Movement Up-To-Date by Ewart G. Culpin  (Retrieved 2011-01-11) The intention was to provide affordable housing to workers coming to Wrexham to work in the expanding industries of coal and iron. Gresford Colliery had recently been opened where it was expected that approximately 3,000 men would be employed in the next two years. A Co-partnership Housing Society was set up in 1913 called Wrexham Tenants Limited, with Lord Kenyon, Mr. David Davies, M.P., and others as Directors to build the houses, while the Trust would build the roads and supervise the development of the estate. The plan was drawn up on an axial layout by the architect G. L. Cunliffe. In the first year, 44 properties were completed;numbers 63\u201369 Acton Gate, numbers 149\u2013167, Chester Road (originally called Bryn Acton) and Cunliffe Walk.

Mottram; No. 7 Y Groes is dated 1913 and inscribed with the initials of the Cardiff Worker's Cooperative Garden Village Society. The houses of Pen-Y-Dre that run alongside the railway line were designed by H. Avray Tipping, though John Newman believes that Tipping's designs may have been ghosted by Eric Francis. Thomas Alwyn Lloyd designed the remainder of Pen-Y-Dre between 1920 and 1923. Lloyd also designed his own residence, 11 Heol Wen at the west end of the road."]}]}}
