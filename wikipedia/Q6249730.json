Porto side of numerous Portuguese internationals in the 1984\u201385 European Cup Winners' Cup (Shrewsbury as an English club could not represent Wales in European competition). Wrexham won the opening leg at the Racecourse Ground 1\u20130, courtesy of a goal from Steel. He had taken the ball on his chest in the centre circle with his back to goal, volleyed the dropping ball for John Muldoon to attack and cross from the right wing into the penalty area, and then jumped to direct a bullet header past Petar Borota. In the second leg at Est\u00e1dio das Antas, Porto were 3\u20130 up after 38 minutes. The Welsh club pulled two goals back before half-time. In the 61st minute Paulo Futre restored Porto's aggregate lead before Wrexham's last minute strike meant the tie finished level at 4\u20134, with Wrexham advancing on away goals."]}, {"page": "John Muldoon", "response": ["John Muldoon may refer to:", "*John Muldoon (rugby union, born 1896) (1896\u20131944), American Olympic rugby union player ", "*John Muldoon (rugby union, born 1982), Connacht rugby player", "*John Muldoon (politician) (1865\u20131938), Irish barrister and nationalist MP in the United Kingdom Parliament", "*John Muldoon (footballer) (born 1964), English footballer"]}]}}
