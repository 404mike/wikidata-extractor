Wedderburn (fl. before 1812) was a Newcastle songwriter, who, according to the information given by John Bell in his Rhymes of Northern Bards published in 1812, has the song \"Nanny of the Tyne\" attributed to this name.The song was set to music by J Aldridge (Junior) of Newcastle. It is not written in Geordie dialect but has a strong Northern connection,\nHowever, in The Tyne Songster, produced by W & T Fordyce in 1840, \"Nanny of the Tyne\" is attributed to \"Gibson\" (with no Christian name).\nThe same song, \"Nanny of the Tyne\", appears on page 334 of Songs of the Bards of the Tyne produced by P. France & Co. c. 1850, again attributed to \"J. Gibson\"  - and  also on page 17 of Volume 7 of The Songs of the Tyne produced by John Ross c. 1846, but in this book it is not attributed to any writer.\nNothing more appears to be known of this person, not even the Christian name, or their sex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "J.
