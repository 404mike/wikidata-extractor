Stevenage took the lead just before the interval, Yemi Odubade tapping the ball into the net after Stacy Long's initial shot had rebounded off of the post. Crewe equalised ten minutes into the second-half, Ashley Westwood scoring from just outside the area.

A week later, Stevenage entertained Burton Albion at Broadhall Way, with the score ending 2\u20131 to the hosts, Stevenage's first home win since August.

Holroyd subsequently missed the resulting penalty kick. Stevenage were awarded another penalty ten minutes before the interval, this time Lawrie Wilson was the player to be fouled. Regular penalty taker Scott Laird stepped up and scored the resulting spot-kick. Shortly after the interval, Burton equalised; long-serving Aaron Webster arriving late into the box to finish neatly and restore parity.
