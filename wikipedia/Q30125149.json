As a tag team performer, he formed a memorable team with Lord James Blears, with whom he won various championships throughout the United States and Canada. As a singles wrestler, he drew large crowds particularly in Toronto against Billy Watson and The Sheik and in Detroit against Dick the Bruiser. He also appeared as a longtime color commentator for wrestling television shows in the Ontario, New York, Ohio and Michigan territories.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernie Roth", "response": ["Ernie Roth got his start in the entertainment business as a disc jockey. He was discovered by Jim Barnett who helped Roth get into the wrestling industry. He became involved in professional wrestling as a manager in the 1960s in Detroit-based territories. Roth first worked under the names \"Mr. Clean\" and \"J. Wellington Radcliffe.\" He also portrayed \"Abdullah Farouk\", the heel (villainous) manager of The Sheik. He frequently appeared on the Toronto wrestling circuit, where local announcer Lord Athol Layton would usually refer to him as \"The weasel, Abdullah Farouk\".", "Roth on many occasions (when out of character and greasepaint mustache) co-hosted the syndicated Big Time Wrestling show with fellow announcer Bob Finnegan until 1969 when the hosting duties went to Lord Athol Layton."]}, {"page": "NWA World Tag Team Championship (Chicago version)", "response": ["The championship was introduced in 1953 when the promoters awarded the championship to Lord James Blears and Lord Athol Layton. The championship was promoted from 1953 until 1960 when Fred Kohler left the NWA to help form the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and thus the AWA World Tag Team Championship became the top tag team championship in the Chicago area. The Chicago promotion would later be bought by Dick Afflis, who merged it with his Indianapolis-based territory. The last NWA World Tag Team Championship was won by the Shires brothers, Roy and Ray, on April 9, 1960. The Volkoffs, Boris and Nicoli, held the championship four times, the record for the Chicago version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Art Neilson and Reggie Lisowski held the championship for 371 days, the longest individual reign in the championship's seven-year history. Being a professional wrestling championship, it is not won or lost competitively, but instead determined by the decision of the bookers of a wrestling promotion. The title is awarded after the chosen team \"wins\" a match to maintain the illusion that professional wrestling is a competitive sport.", "|Lord James Blears and Lord Athol Layton || 1 || ", "|Lord Athol Layton || 1 || "]}, {"page": "Maple Leaf Wrestling", "response": ["*Lord Athol Layton"]}, {"page": "WWA International Television Tag Team Championship", "response": ["|Lord James Blears and Lord Athol Layton", "|Lord James Blears and Lord Athol Layton"]}, {"page": "Fred Atkins", "response": ["**NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Lord Athol Layton"]}, {"page": "Lord James Blears", "response": ["In the early 1950s, Blears relocated to California.
