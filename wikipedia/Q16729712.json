Paulo Jr. again opened the scoring for Ottawa off a pass from Fernando Timb\u00f3 in the first half. This scoreline held until halftime, when all of the Fury players other than Carl Haworth were substituted. Early in the second half, Dennis Chin added to the lead after finishing a cross from Mozzi Gyorio. Chin then set up a goal by Carl Haworth, his first of the pre-season. Haworth then returned the favour, feeding Chin for the match's fourth and final goal. Striker Pablo Dyego did not appear in the match, possibly the result of the injury he sustained towards the end of the previous friendly against Indy Eleven. Academy players Jeff Addai and Zoom Langwa again appeared for the first team.", "On 10 March, the Fury played a friendly against USL neighbours Rochester Rhinos. The match consisted of four 30-minute quarters, totaling 120 minutes. In the second quarter, Paulo Jr. converted a penalty to give Ottawa a 1\u20130 lead. Shortly afterwards, Rochester scored to bring the teams level going into half-time. At the break, Ottawa substituted all its players save Lance Rozeboom. The third quarter went poorly for the Fury as the Rhinos added another two goals to go up 3\u20131. Goalkeeper Andrew MacRae then made a save on a penalty to keep the deficit at two. In the fourth quarter Mozzi Gyorio clawed one back for Ottawa off a pass by fellow Canadian Carl Haworth. Academy player Jeff Addai then supplied a cross to Gerardo Bruna, who finished late in the game to seal a draw.", "The club finished its pre-season slate with a 3\u20131 win over FC Montreal on 19 March.
