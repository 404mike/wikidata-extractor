Scoring a quick try in the second half, the Warriors game seemed to lose a gear after Sione Tuipulotu ran in for what would have been a sixth try, but the referee Ben Whitehouse chalked it off for obstruction. This let the South African side regroup somewhat and at the end of the match the Sharks had scored 3 tries; which was an otherwise comfortable game for the Glasgow giants. Glasgow Assistant Coach Peter Murchie was delighted with Glasgow's play up until the Warriors eased off: \"I thought we were excellent for the first 50 minutes \u2013 we scored some fantastic tries and that\u2019s probably some of the best rugby we\u2019ve played since I\u2019ve been here as a coach.\"Bonus-point victory pleases Murchie | Glasgow Warriors Darge received another man of the match award against the Lions.
