Craven, who was well known in the area because of his short stature (he was 4\u00a0ft 7in tall), had gone into his shop to collect papers despite there being no racing that day. It is believed that he had \u00a3200 in his wallet (\u00a33,200.00 in 2015 prices) which went missing. Mr Craven suffered extensive injuries at the hands of the killer. Because the local constabulary had a very narrow time frame for the murder, and the fact the killer must have been covered in blood, they anticipated a quick arrest. The Craven murder remains unsolved, but rumours that Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, was responsible for his murder resurfaced in 2017. ITV Calendar News asked Sutcliffe about Craven's death and also that of a taxi driver on Bingley Moor. In what was described as a \"bizarre letter\", Sutcliffe responded that he was not responsible for either crime to presenter Christine Talbot."]}, {"page": "Mike Morris (TV presenter)", "response": ["Morris returned to regional television in 1996 when he became a main anchor for Yorkshire Television's flagship news programme Calendar, alongside Christa Ackroyd and Christine Talbot.
