The Dresser is set in a London theatre during the Blitz, where an aging actor-manager, Sir, prepares for his starring role in King Lear with the help of his devoted dresser, Norman. Hopkins described his role as Sir as \"the highlight of my life. It was a chance to work with the actors I had run away from. To play another actor is fun because you know the ins and outs of their thinking \u2013 especially with someone like Sir, who is a diabolically insecure, egotistical man.\" He spoke again on the impact the role had on him in 2018, \"When I was at the Royal National Theatre all those years ago, I knew I had something in me, but I didn\u2019t have the discipline. I had a Welsh temperament and didn\u2019t have that 'fitting in' mechanism. I would fight, I would rebel. I thought, 'Well, I don\u2019t belong here.' And for almost 50 years afterwards, I felt that edge of, 'I don\u2019t belong anywhere, I\u2019m a loner.' But in The Dresser, when Ian [McKellen] responded, it was wonderful. We got on so well and I suddenly felt at home, as though that lack of belonging was all in my imagination, all in my vanity\"."]}, {"page": "List of South Africans", "response": ["*Ronald Harwood, playwright and writer (1934\u20132020)"]}, {"page": "Ian McKellen", "response": ["In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins' Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's The Dresser, alongside Edward Fox, Vanessa Kirby, and Emily Watson.
