In addition to spreading the word of Lister's pioneering work on antiseptics and widening the use of chloroform and morphine on the battlefield the ambulance helped to popularise a standardised method of treating bullet wounds which was based on Surgeon-General Sir Thomas Longmore's 1863 work with Mini\u00e9 rifle bullet wounds.  MacCormac claimed that the adoption of this method was the primary reason for the low mortality rates achieved by the ambulance."]}]}}
