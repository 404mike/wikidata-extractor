After serving as a junior officer during the French Revolutionary Wars and Irish Rebellion of 1798, he became Commanding Officer of the Grenadier Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards during the disastrous Walcheren Campaign. He served as a brigade commander at the Battle of Vitoria and then at the Battle of Roncesvalles on 25 July 1813 when his brigade took the brunt of the French assault and held its position for three hours in the early morning before finally being forced back. During the Hundred Days he commanded the 2nd Guards Brigade at the Battle of Quatre Bras in June 1815 and again at the Battle of Waterloo later that month when light companies from his brigade played an important role in the defence of Ch\u00e2teau d'Hougoumont. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Ireland and, after leaving Ireland in 1831, he was elected as Whig Member of Parliament for Poole in Dorset and was one of the few military men who supported the Reform Bill, for which he was rewarded with a peerage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harmondsworth", "response": ["*Baron Strafford, of Harmondsworth, in the county of Middlesex (1772\u20131860), (aka Field Marshal John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford, GCB, GCH, PC)"]}, {"page": "Coldstream Guards", "response": ["* Field Marshal John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford, 1850\u20131860"]}, {"page": "Peerage of the United Kingdom", "response": ["| John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford"]}, {"page": "Viscount Torrington", "response": ["Several other members of the Byng family have also gained distinction.
