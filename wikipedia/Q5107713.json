Teammate and club legend Phil Sproson named Siddall as the club's best goalkeeper of the 1980s. However, he handed in his notice at Vale Park in October 1983 following a contract dispute, and was loaned to Sam Ellis's Blackpool. Despite only spending the one month at Bloomfield Road, during his seven league games for the \"Seasiders\", Blackpool were the victors in six of them, which assisted in their finishing sixth in the Fourth Division.
