De Ville's mother and maternal grandmother were English. Because his family fell into hard times De Ville was raised from the age of eight by a maternal uncle who had a brickmaking business in Hammersmith.\nDe Ville was the most prominent practical phrenologist, supplier and maker of phrenological casts in London from the 1820s to the 1840s. By 1826 Johann Spurzheim declared that De Ville's collection was the finest he had ever seen. Franz Joseph Gall himself also highly valued De Ville's work and sent a wax mould of a dissected brain as a token of respect. De Ville's casts were distributed throughout the world and many still survive in the collection of the Edinburgh School of Anatomy.\nIn 1840 he became a member of the Phrenological Association and resigned in 1842 upon the occasion of the great split among British phrenologists when William Collins Engledue (1813\u20131858), in a speech before the Association, announced that phrenology and materialism were the same.\n\nDe Ville examined an enormous number of heads including those of many well-known figures including John Elliotson, Hermann Prince of P\u00fcckler-Muskau, William de Salis, Harriet Martineau, Charles Bray, George Eliot, William Blake, Richard Dale Owen, Richard Carlile, the Duke of Wellington and Prince Albert.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sophia Elizabeth De Morgan", "response": ["The Frends moved back to central London\u2014Tavistock Square\u2014in 1831.

Sophia became a confidante of Lady Byron, on family matters."]}, {"page": "Study for Portrait II (After the Life Mask of William Blake)", "response": ["Blake was around fifty years old when the cast was made by the sculptor and phrenologist James De Ville, whose method and approach were influenced by his teacher, the English sculptor Joseph Nollekens, who to avoid suffocation provided his models with straws while submerged in the casting material.\"NPG 1809 William Blake\". National Portrait Gallery. Retrieved 4 November 2018 Although Bacon's work is titled as a \"life mask\", the painting more resembles a death mask, as evidence by dark black flat, simplified background and the figure's closed eyes and pallid skin.Van Alphen (1992), p. 105 His lips are tightly pursed and turned downward as in Deville's cast. While his left eye is tightly shut, his right eyebrow is raised. Jones writes that, with this painting, Bacon \"apprehends something beneath the visible skin: an inner self, suffering in absolute isolation.\" In this Bacon's portrait resembles Deville's original cast, which was viewed favourably by those who knew Blake. The National Portrait Gallery notes how Blake's friend, the artist George Richmond (1809\u201396) \"said that the unnatural severity of the mouth was caused by the discomforture of the process 'as the plaster pulled out a quantity of his hair.\""]}]}}
