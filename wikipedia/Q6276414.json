The only goal of the game came after half-an-hour, with Leon Clarke latching onto Robin Shroot's misguided backpass to make no mistake from inside the area. Stevenage secured their first home league victory of the season in their following match, on 12 October, with a 2\u20131 win over Brentford. After trailing early-on from a close range Clayton Donaldson goal, Stevenage responded through two quickfire Fran\u00e7ois Zoko goals. The first of which came when Zoko, making his league debut for the club, pounced on goalkeeper David Button's error to level, before the same man turned in the rebound after Jordan Burrow's initial shot had been saved. A week later, Stevenage narrowly lost away at Walsall, losing 2\u20131. Fran\u00e7ois Zoko scored Stevenage's goal, a late consolation strike after Walsall had earned a commanding lead courtesy of goals either side of the half-time interval. Just three days later, on 22 October, Stevenage earned a convincing 3\u20130 away victory over Crewe Alexandra. All three goals came in the opening 20 minutes of the match. Filipe Morais opened the scoring when he latched onto Fran\u00e7ois Zoko's knock down to finish calmly. Just two minutes later, Stevenage had doubled their advantage, this time through Luke Freeman's driven effort from a tight angle. Morais then scored his second of the match when he collected the ball outside the area and curled a shot past Steve Phillips in the Crewe goal. Stevenage secured back-to-back league wins for the first time in the season when they defeated Crawley Town 2\u20130 at Broadhall Way on 26 October. A powerful header from defender Peter Hartley gave the home side the lead after just eight minutes, before Michael Doughty doubled their advantage in injury-time with a left-footed shot that crept into the corner of the goal.", "First Round fixtures for the competition were released on 17 June 2013, with Stevenage being drawn at home to Championship opposition in the form of Ipswich Town. The match, played on 6 August, ended 2\u20130 in Stevenage's favour, the club's first competitive victory of the season. Both goals came in the second-half, the first coming from the penalty spot after Oumare Tounkara had been fouled in the area; with the resultant spot-kick being converting by Filipe Morais. Debutant Jordan Burrow doubled Stevenage's lead, sliding in from close range following good work from Robin Shroot and Simon Heslop down the right hand side. The victory meant Stevenage had progressed to the Second Round of the competition for only the second time in their history. Two days later, on 8 August, the draw for the next round was made, with the club being dealt their first ever away tie in the League Cup, facing Premier League side Everton at Goodison Park.", "|FW||Jordan Burrow || Morecambe || Free Transfer || 31 May 2013 ||"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["|FW|| Jordan Burrow|| Lincoln City||Free||21 May 2014||"]}, {"page": "2016 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|CF ||9||  Jordan Burrow"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|14||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Jordan Burrow"]}]}}
