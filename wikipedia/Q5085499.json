Aware of the financial problems that had dogged the club in the past, McGrory implemented a policy of blooding young talent. He replaced himself with Charlie Scrimshaw while Frank Soo displaced Harry Sellars is midfield and the emerging Freddie Steele edged out Tommy Sale. It was brave management and it paid off as the young players developed into one of the most exciting teams in the country in the 1930s and in McGrory's first season in charge they finished a highest ever position of fourth with 47 points."]}, {"page": "Billy Spencer", "response": ["After recovering from his injury he helped Stoke to gain promotion to the First Division in 1932\u201333. When McGrory became manager in 1935\u201336 he moved Spencer out to right-back to accommodate the emerging Charlie Scrimshaw and Spencer's form suffered as a result. After losing his place midway through the 1935\u201336 season to Bill Winstanley, Spencer became a player-coach with the reserves where he spent the next two seasons. He then moved to Crewe Alexandra for \u00a3750 in June 1938 when he played just three matches before deciding to retire. In total he played 354 games for Stoke City and without managing to score goal."]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Charlie Scrimshaw"]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Charlie Scrimshaw"]}, {"page": "1932\u201333 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Charlie Scrimshaw"]}, {"page": "1933\u201334 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Charlie Scrimshaw"]}, {"page": "1934\u201335 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Charlie Scrimshaw"]}, {"page": "1935\u201336 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Charlie Scrimshaw"]}, {"page": "1936\u201337 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Charlie Scrimshaw"]}, {"page": "Jack Challinor", "response": ["Challinor was born in Middlewich and played for Witton Albion before joining Stoke City in 1937.

Sadly though as in the past injuries again interrupted the managers team and formation plans as both Freddie Steele and Charlie Scrimshaw suffered long term injuries. In November 1937 Stoke accepted a \u00a36,000 offer from West Bromwich Albion for Joe Johnson and in his place Bob McGrory selected Frank Baker. In October 1937 Stoke played Scottish champions Rangers in a benefit match for the victims of the Holditch Colliery disaster, raising \u00a32,000 for the relief fund.

The fans did not share the club's confidence and their judgement appeared to be justified as the team spent the first three months of the season in the bottom four. Manager Bob McGrory's patience was wearing thin and he started to trim his squad, selling Charlie Scrimshaw to Middlesbrough for \u00a33,000 and veteran Arthur Turner to Birmingham.
