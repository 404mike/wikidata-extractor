Because of the recent contretemps over Van Dieren, Heseltine submitted these pieces as \"Peter Warlock\". They were published under this pseudonym, which he thereafter adopted for all his subsequent musical output, reserving his own name for critical and analytical writings. At around this time the composer Charles Wilfred Orr recalled Heseltine as \"a tall fair youth of about my own age\", trying without success to convince a sceptical Delius of the merits of Van Dieren's piano works. Orr was particularly struck by Heseltine's whistling abilities which he describes as  \"flute-like in quality and purity\".Palmer, pp. 174\u201375"]}, {"page": "Painswick", "response": ["* Charles Wilfred Orr, composer, lived in Painswick from 1934\u201376."]}, {"page": "A Shropshire Lad", "response": ["During the immediate postwar period, two other composers made extensive use of the poems in A Shropshire Lad.
