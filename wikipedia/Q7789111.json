Small Heath's campaign began at Liverpool, whose forwards were restricted to one goal in the first half through the efforts of Lester and Oliver, but in the second, the Liverpool Mercury's report that \"the whole of the play was confined to the visitors' quarters\" was little of an exaggeration as the home side won 4\u20130. In the home match, Hallam and Walton came in for Mobley and Farnall. Small Heath came close to conceding when Tom Bradshaw spotted Meates off his line, but Jack Oliver got back in time to clear. They had more of the play, with Wheldon was particularly dangerous in attack, and threw caution to the winds as full-time approached, but the game finished goalless. A 3\u20130 defeat at Manchester City confirmed Small Heath's relegation to the Second Division for the 1896\u201397 season. Meates opened the scoring for City when he sliced the ball into his own net in attempting a clearance, and after Hallam failed to take a good chance in the first half and struck the crossbar in the second as the visitors tried hard to equalise, City scored twice more towards the end of the match. For the last test match, at home to Manchester City, Small Heath selected Thomas Dunlop and Walter Abbott instead of Oliver and Hands. Small Heath had all of the play, \"shots without number\" were attempted but only one was scored by half-time. They scored a further seven in the second half, with hat-tricks for Jones and Wheldon and a goal on debut for Abbott."]}, {"page": "1897\u201398 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Nineteen different players represented the club in nationally organised competitive matches during the season and there were thirteen different goalscorers.
