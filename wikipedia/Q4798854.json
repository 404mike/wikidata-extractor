He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Essex Regiment, he served as aide-de-camp (1931\u201332) to George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon, Governor-General of the Union of South Africa.Nicknamed \"Pauly,\" he was the author of William, or More Loved than Loving, first published in 1933 by Collins, republished 1956 by Chapman & Hall, in an edition with illustrations by Osbert Lancaster and an introduction by Evelyn Waugh. He was a translator of French and German texts. His translation of The Three Musketeers, under the name Lord Sudley, was published by Penguin in 1952.He succeeded to the title Earl of Arran of the Arran Islands upon the death of his father on 19 December 1958, but never took his seat in the House of Lords. He died by suicide on 28 December 1958, just nine days after the death of his father, at Poltimore, Devon. Aged 55, Arran was unmarried, and reportedly killed himself because he was gay.Following his death, a schoolmate eulogised him in The Times:\n\nAt Winchester \"Pauly\" was an intelligent, graceful, retiring boy with a delicious sense of humour. He was a sound bat in good company and already showed ability at lawn tennis, the game he grew to love. He blossomed at Oxford. His diffidence remained but became more subtle, and his charm, rooted in understatement, developed. At this time he taught himself to play the piano and he would sing for hours in his wistful Melville Gideon voice, to himself or to anyone who happened to be in the room. Pauly's great, and rare, gift was his originality: long after most men have become conditioned and conventionalized he continued to view the world with his own particular vision, which contained an extraordinary mixture of sophistication and innocence. He had a very affectionate nature, of which he was half ashamed, and could inspire lasting affection in others.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Gore, 6th Earl of Arran", "response": ["*Arthur Gore, 7th Earl of Arran (1903\u20131958), died by suicide nine days after succeeding to the title"]}, {"page": "Arthur Gore", "response": ["*Arthur Gore, 7th Earl of Arran (1903\u20131958), Anglo-Irish author"]}]}}
