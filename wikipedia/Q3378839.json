In the 1996 Five Nations, Guscott famously came off the bench to play on the wing against each of Ireland and Wales; in each instance sparking the squad's confidence and playing direct roles in their triumphs."]}, {"page": "Mike Tindall", "response": ["Tindall joined Bath straight from school, as an 18-year-old in 1997.
