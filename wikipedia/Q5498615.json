It has sometimes been suggested that this line of business was the result of the marriage of his father in 1760 to the sister of Thomas Harris, who for many years was the proprietor and manager of Covent Garden, one of the three licensed theatres in London at that time. In fact, Longman had previously published several plays performed outside London. The Longman interest in the theatrical market is also reflected in translations of plays, among them August von Kotzebue\u2019s The East Indian (1799). Some British dramatists had the majority of their books published by Longman; others were \u2018printed under the authority of and by permission of the managers from the prompt books\u2019.
