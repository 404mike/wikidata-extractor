Hardy was able to tell Nelson that 14 or 15 enemy ships had struck their flags: Nelson replied that he had \"bargained for 20\".Broadley, p. 143 In their last conversation, Nelson reminded Hardy to anchor the fleet. Nelson went on to say \"take care of my dear Lady Hamilton, Hardy, take care of poor Lady Hamilton\" and then when the moment came for the two men to part for the last time, Nelson then very close to death, asked Hardy to kiss him. Hardy kissed him on the cheek; \"Now I am satisfied,\" said Nelson, \"Thank God I have done my duty\". Hardy stood up and then having spent a few moments looking down silently at his friend, knelt and kissed him again on the forehead. \"Who is that?\" asked Nelson, now barely able to see. \"It is Hardy\" Hardy replied. \"God bless you Hardy\" was Nelson's last response.
