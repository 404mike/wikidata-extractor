He also appeared in two M.R. James adaptations on television, in the Mystery and Imagination episode \"Room 13\" and the Omnibus episode \"Whistle and I'll Come to You\".His jovial manner lent itself to comedy films as well, including An Alligator Named Daisy (1955), Three Men in a Boat (1956), Two-Way Stretch (1960), Raising the Wind (1961), What a Carve Up! (1961), Only Two Can Play (1962), Nurse on Wheels (1963), Heavens Above!

Of course, this being a class-riddled Rank picture, it's the nanny who loses the baby, but it's pretty harrowing nonetheless, despite the casting of insipid David Knight and Julia Arnall as baby Simon's parents. Granite-faced cop David Farrar is on hand to bring grit to screenwriter Janet Green's earnest chase movie, and not-so-hidden among the red herrings are a welter of British character players, with particularly impressive work from Thora Hird. The little-known Anna Turner also gives a fine performance as the tormented baby-snatcher, and Harry Waxman's colour location photography is superb, but the cliff-top climax is a little hard to believe.\""]}, {"page": "The Big Blockade", "response": ["*George Woodbridge as Quisling  "]}, {"page": "Exeter School", "response": ["*George Woodbridge, actor, stage, screen and television"]}, {"page": "The Day Will Dawn", "response": ["* George Woodbridge as journalist sitting at bar in pub"]}, {"page": "An Inspector Calls (1954 film)", "response": ["*George Woodbridge as Stanley: Fish & Chips Shop Owner"]}, {"page": "Blanche Fury", "response": ["* George Woodbridge as Aimes"]}, {"page": "Temptation Harbour", "response": ["*George Woodbridge as Mr. Frost"]}, {"page": "I See a Dark Stranger", "response": ["*George Woodbridge as Walter"]}, {"page": "Children of Chance (1949 film)", "response": ["* George Woodbridge as Butcher"]}, {"page": "The Crowded Day", "response": ["* George Woodbridge as Ernest"]}, {"page": "The Moonraker", "response": ["* George Woodbridge as Captain Lowry"]}, {"page": "Double Confession", "response": ["* George Woodbridge as Sergeant Swanton"]}, {"page": "The Naked Heart", "response": ["* George Woodbridge as Samuel Chapdelaine"]}, {"page": "Diamonds on Wheels", "response": ["*George Woodbridge as PC Andrew"]}, {"page": "The Flesh and the Fiends", "response": ["* George Woodbridge as Dr. Ferguson"]}, {"page": "Whistle and I'll Come to You", "response": ["* George Woodbridge \u2013 Hotel Proprietor"]}, {"page": "What a Carve Up!
