He became active in local politics and was Sheriff of Canterbury for 1786\u201387.\nIn 1796, Baker was elected Member of Parliament for Canterbury on what was called the independent interest. He headed the poll with 774 votes but the election was declared void on petition under the provisions of the Treating Act. At the second election in March 1797 he again had a majority of votes, \"although not one public-house had been opened in their interest, nor a single cockade distributed\". However a protest was entered against the eligibility of the two elected MPs and the sitting members were re-instated.In 1802 Baker was elected MP for Canterbury without opposition. He was returned  again at the general elections of 1806, 1807, and 1812, and retired at that of 1818. In politics he was always a consistent Whig. He was also appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Canterbury volunteers in 1803.\nBaker died at Canterbury, aged 76.
