A year before their first attempt to make the Olympic team, the twins were living in their Ford Mustang. While Calvin was the star in high school, setting the National High School Record in the 400 meters, it was Alvin who earned the first Olympic spot in 1996 at the 1996 Olympic Trials. While he made the finals in the individual 400 meters, he drew lane one and finished fourth behind Michael Johnson's gold medal performance. But Johnson injured himself setting the world record in the 200 meters. Without their Gold medalist and also without world record holder Butch Reynolds, the American team looked vulnerable in the 4 x 400 meters relay.  The British team looked to take advantage by going out hard in the lead, however as the second leg of the team, Alvin over took Jamie Baulch on the home stretch to put USA into the lead, a lead they ultimately would not relinquish, giving Alvin a gold medal."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2000 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Jamie Baulch", "|align=left|Jamie BaulchDaniel CainesJared DeaconIwan Thomas"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1996 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Jamie Baulch, Roger Black, Mark Richardson, Iwan Thomas, Mark Hylton (heats) and Du'aine Ladejo (heats) \u2013 Athletics, Men's 4 \u00d7 400 m Relay", "*Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Du'aine Ladejo, Mark Richardson and Roger Black"]}, {"page": "1998 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Mark Hylton Jamie Baulch, Iwan Thomas Mark Richardson ||2.58.68"]}, {"page": "2002 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Jared DeaconMatthew EliasJamie BaulchDaniel Caines||3:01.25"]}, {"page": "4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["|Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, Roger Black", "|Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, Roger Black", "|Iwan Thomas, Roger Black, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson", "|Allyn CondonSolomon WarisoAdrian PatrickJamie BaulchSean Baldock*", "|Jamie BaulchTimothy BenjaminCori HenryDaniel CainesMark Hylton*Jared Deacon*"]}, {"page": "2003 IAAF World Indoor Championships", "response": ["|Jamie BaulchTimothy BenjaminCori HenryDaniel CainesMark Hylton*Jared Deacon*||3:06.12"]}, {"page": "1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships", "response": ["|Allyn CondonSolomon WarisoAdrian PatrickJamie Baulch||3:03.20(NR)"]}]}}
