The night was also held in a variety of venues including The George IV, The Crypt and The Junction. They were joined by DJs including DJ Sneak, Daft Punk, and singer Corrina Joseph. They mutated the night into an equally popular club called Rooty, the namesake of their second album. Initially, the duo considered \"Underground Oasis\" as a name for the group, but the idea was scrapped reportedly after a friend informed them of a similarly-named rock band that might \"get big\".", "An important milestone for Basement Jaxx's career was their role as the opening act for successful French dance group Daft Punk's Daftendirektour. It was around this time that Basement Jaxx began collaborating with vocalist Corrina Joseph, a collaboration that resulted in the single, \"Fly Life\", which was released by Virgin Records in 1997. Following the success of \"Fly Life\", the duo signed a record deal with XL, with whom they released their subsequent six albums."]}, {"page": "DJ-Kicks: Nightmares on Wax", "response": ["#Nightmares on Wax - Play On (featuring Corrina Joseph)  \u2013 4:36"]}, {"page": "Fly Life", "response": ["\"Fly Life\" (often stylized as \"Flylife\") is a song by English electronic dance music duo Basement Jaxx from their fourth extended play, EP3, released in 1996.

A track from it, \"Fly Life\", is a house song with ragga, disco, proto-punk and UK garage influences. Its basis was \"Live Your Life with Me\", a single originally performed by vocalist Corrina Joseph in 1998, the singer whom they had been working with since the release of EP2 (1995) for their first attempts at making \"proper songs\". The duo's re-work of \"Live Your Life with Me\" added \"euphoric synth\" and \"filtered brass stabs\" with long-winded air horn throughout.
