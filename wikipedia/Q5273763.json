He was a founding member of the bands Orlando and Fosca, and briefly played guitar in the band Spearmint.Known for his dandy aesthetic, Dickon has peroxide blonde hair and is often seen in a white, blue, or silver-grey three-piece suit, the silver-grey suit being a bequest from fellow London dandy Sebastian Horsley.He has kept a blog called The Diary at the Centre of the Earth since 8 December 1997 (predating the 1999 coining of the term \"blog\"). Excerpts from the blog were included in Travis Elborough and Nick Rennison's A London Year and in the follow-up title A Traveller's Year.In March 2008 he released a printed collection of lyrics titled The Portable Dickon Edwards, which was released in a limited edition alongside Fosca's The Painted Side of the Rocket album.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Orlando (band)", "response": ["The band consisted of Dickon Edwards, Tim Chipping, Neil Turner, Mike Austen and David Gray. Musically, Orlando combined the synthesised dance-pop of 1990s boybands and American swingbeat acts with verbose lyrics in the general style of Morrissey and Richey Edwards."]}, {"page": "Spearmint (band)", "response": ["The original lineup included founder Shirley Lee (guitar and lead vocals), Simon Calnan (keyboard and backing vocals), Ronan Larvor (drums), and Martin Talbot (bass guitar). Forming their own record label (which they named hitBack), the group released their earliest songs as vinyl white labels. James Parsons replaced Talbot before the release of the band's second single, \"Goldmine\". Dickon Edwards joined as second guitarist around the time of the album A Week Away. Parsons soon replaced him, the bass vacancy filled by Andy Lewis.. They have more recently reverted to the four-piece line-up of the late 1990s."]}, {"page": "Fosca (band)", "response": ["Fosca  was a British band, combining indie pop songwriting with synthpop instrumentation.  Initially, the band was formed by bassist Peter Theobalds and Orlando guitarist/lyricist Dickon Edwards plus Orlando drummer David Gray, before settling into being a vehicle for Edwards and his songs. Over the next decade, Edwards fronted several (predominantly female) lineups of the band including guitarist Charley Stone (formerly of Gay Dad).  They released a total of three studio albums between 2000-2008. The band was named after the protagonist in Stephen Sondheim's Passion based upon the translation of Lawrence Venuti of the novel Fosca by Iginio Ugo Tarchetti, 1869.  They received press coverage from The Independent.", "The original version of Fosca was founded in the summer of 1997 as a hard rock side project by Dickon Edwards, then concurrently the guitarist and lyricist for the Romo band Orlando, together with Orlando's live drummer David Gray and a bass player named Peter Theobalds. Edwards recruited laddish lead vocalist Sav in what he would later describe as \"an experiment of the Laddish Lion lying down with the Limp-wristed Lamb.\". This line-up performed five concerts between September 1997 and February 1998 - the first two predating Dickon's final appearance with Orlando, which he left to concentrate on Fosca. The final concert featured Charley Stone as guest guitarist.", "The remaining eight songs for the album were rerecorded in 2000 with a new synth-based sound not dissimilar to that of Orlando, and released, still under the title On Earth To Make The Numbers Up, and preceded by the single The Agony Without the Ecstasy on Shinkansen Recordings (an offshoot of Sarah Records who in early 1995 had released the Reproduction Is Pollution EP by Orlando under the alternative name Shelley).  By this time, the band had stabilized into Dickon Edwards on vocals and guitar, Rachel Stevenson on keyboards and vocals, Alex Sharkey also on keyboards and vocals and Sheila B on cello. In 2001 the band released Supine On The Astroturf as the first single from their second album.  By the time follow-up single Secret Crush On Third Trombone and the parent album Diary Of An Antibody were recorded and released in 2002, Sharkey had been replaced by Kate Dornan, formerly the editor of Orlando website Orlando Magic.", "After a gap of some six years due to the collapse of Shinkansen, Fosca signed with the Swedish independent record label But Is It Art?, on which they released a live album in 2007, followed by their third studio album The Painted Side of the Rocket in Sweden on 5 March 2008. UK release on 28 April.  The label also released a book of Dickon's lyrics for Fosca and Orlando, The Portable Dickon Edwards. Lyrics and Other Alibis 1993-2008.  By then, the current line-up was Dickon Edwards on vocals and guitar, Rachel Stevenson on keyboards and vocals, Kate Dornan on keyboards and vocals, Tom Edwards on guitar and former member Charley Stone returning to perform live on guitar. A further single, \"The Man I'm Not Today\" / \"My Diogenes Heart\" was released later in 2008. Dickon disbanded Fosca in March 2009, with the final concert being at Klubb Republik in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden on 14 March.", "*Dickon Edwards's Website (with his online diary The Diary at the Centre of the Earth)"]}, {"page": "Richard Edwards", "response": ["* Dickon Edwards (born 1971), diarist and front man of the band Fosca"]}, {"page": "Romo", "response": ["By this time, more acts were emerging from the scene. Orlando who had played live as an indie band in 1993-1994 before withdrawing to reinvent themselves as an \"alienated\" white soul duo consisting of singer Tim Chipping, guitarist/lyricist Dickon Edwards and some sidemen, approached Club Skinny to relaunch themselves as a live act. Punk trio Xerox Girls likewise reinvented themselves as a glacial synth/electro duo Hollywood consisting of singer Hannah Edgren and keyboardist Stacey Leigh, with third member David Gray (Leigh's then-boyfriend) retained as a synth programmer. Gray would later become Orlando's live drummer while Nugent would take over the management of both bands.", "More seriously, the strain of having to live, eat and sleep together rather than merely go nightclubbing together had severely strained relations between the bands.Interviews with Dickon Edwards & Simon Price, Romo tour coverage, Newsbeat BBC Radio 1, March 1996, as was featured on original of  Passive Soul era page on archive of Tim Chipping's 'Ear Medicine' Orlando retrospective site Chipping was relatively diplomatic about this in one interview at the time: \"There's a definite reason why we have two tourbuses. It's to do with the fact that some bands just won't tour with each other, not because they dislike each other, they just have different... living styles.\"", "The bands mostly concentrated on their recording contracts at this point \u2013 in late 1996 Hollywood released a heavily remixed single Apocalypse Kiss. Hollywood's Hannah Edgren was spotted (by Dickon Edwards) fronting a new band in 1998 and she and Stacey Leigh would later reunite as Fubar.  Plastic Fantastic \u2013 having previously released the Eno-influenced \"Fantastique no.5\" - recorded two albums' worth of tracks which were never released due to a dispute with Mercury over the mix of planned second single \"Plastic World.\"  In 1997, Stuart Miller dissolved Plastic Fantastic and revived his old band Supercharger.  Sexus, who had also released a second single '\"The Official End Of It All\" and recorded an album The Boyfriend Olympics, similarly fell out with ZTT over the mix of planned third single \"How Do You Kiss\". After the fallout, they were frozen into inactivity due to a dispute with management over their final payout from ZTT but would eventually re-emerge in 2002 as the Psychodelicates with a download/mail order album Psychodelicates Go Adventuring.", "Thus by the middle of 1997 it was left to Orlando and Minty to be the most prolific \u2013 and in that sense the most successful \u2013 Romo bands as they were the only two of the seven core acts to reach the stage of releasing their respective albums. Orlando, having already released two singles \"Just for a Second\" and The Magic EP in late 1996 (the latter of which achieved #96 on the UK Singles Chart) and a third, \"Nature's Hated\" in spring 1997, having toured extensively with Kenickie and having scored the only UK Top 75 chart hit of any core Romo act with their contribution to the Fever Pitch soundtrack EP, a cover of Tim Hardin's \"How Can We Hang On to a Dream\", released their album Passive Soul in October that year before Dickon Edwards departed to found Fosca. Tim Chipping would continue to use the Orlando band name for a planned folk-orientated second album under the working title Sick Folk (to have included a collaboration with Kenickie/Rosita members Marie Du Santiago and Emmy-Kate Montrose), before finally dissolving Orlando in Spring 2000.", "Several other Romo musicians ran glam/style orientated club nights \u2013 notably Minty vocalist Mathew Glammore's \"Kashpoint\" (at a January 2004 instalment of which Glammore performed a medley of old Minty songs and a March 2005 instalment of which featured a Minty reunion), Xavior's \"Hanky Panky Kabaret\" clubnight (and associated meetings in London's Wolsey restaurant) and Dickon Edwards' \"Beautiful And Damned\" and \"Against Nature\".
