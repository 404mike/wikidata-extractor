She published studies on the intellectual and social development of children and promoted the nursery school movement. For Isaacs, the best way for children to learn was by developing their independence. She believed that the most effective way to achieve this was through play, and that the role of adults and early educators was to guide children's play.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 12", "response": ["*1948 \u2013 Susan Sutherland Isaacs, English psychologist and psychoanalyst (b. 1885)"]}, {"page": "1885", "response": ["* May 24 \u2013 Susan Sutherland Isaacs, English educational psychologist, psychoanalyst (d. 1948)"]}, {"page": "Home education in the United Kingdom", "response": ["With the growth of the schooling system came fresh theories and philosophies of education such as those of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi who would influence the likes of Herbert Spencer who in his essays on education (1854 and 1859) argued against the traditional authoritative classical form of education that disregarded the natural wishes, tendencies, and motives of the child.Essays on Education and Kindred Subjects, Introduction by Charles W.

The Pykes had a son, David Pyke (1921\u20132001), and Pyke became preoccupied by the question of his son's education. In October 1924, to create an education that differed from his own and promoted curiosity whilst equipping young people to live in the twentieth century, he set up an infants' school in his Cambridge home. His wife, Margaret, was a strong supporter of the school and its ideas. Pyke recruited a psychologist, Susan Sutherland Isaacs, to run the school, and although Pyke had many original ideas regarding education, he promised her that he would not interfere."]}]}}
