Harington is best known for her work on the eight-part children's television series Jesus of Nazareth (1956), which was broadcast live, although it did contain pre-filmed exterior sequences shot in Galilee and Jerusalem. The project was controversial because at the time it was not legal for an actor to portray Jesus in a public performance; however, an exception was made for this series and it was widely seen as a success. It was. Harington received an award in 1956 from the Guild of Television Directors and Producers (now known as BAFTA), marking the first time a children's programme was awarded such an honour.
