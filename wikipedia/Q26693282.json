The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales describes the architecture of the court as \"a Home Counties style unusual to Wales\". Sir Joseph Bradney, writing in his multi-volume A History of Monmouthshire from the Coming of the Normans into Wales down to the Present Time, noted the house as presenting \"no particular signs of antiquity, but distinguished by its fine situation\". Bradney also recorded the owner at the time of writing (1906) as being Major Edward Herbert, Chief constable of Monmouthshire, and that previous residents had included two Bishops of Llandaff, William Van Mildert and Edward Copleston. The grounds have an ornamental lake and fountain.
