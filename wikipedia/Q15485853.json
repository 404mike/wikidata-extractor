He was a regular reporter on the BBC current affairs programme Tonight during the 1960s. He was also Rector of Edinburgh University and won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. In 1958 he wrote  an account of 1950s British literature, The Angry Decade, at the end of which he remarked that: \"In this technologically triumphant age, when the rockets begin to scream up towards the moon but the human mind seems at an even greater distance, anger has a limited use. Love has a wider application, and it is that which needs describing wherever it can be found so that we may all recognise it and learn its use.\" He was married in St Peter's Church, Ealing, in March 1942. He served in the R.A.F. in the Second World War and had a leg amputated after  an injury on an assault course, which left him in constant pain.The inquest on his death recorded an open verdict, despite having found that it was brought about by an overdose of barbiturates. He is buried at Powerstock in Dorset.The Kenneth Allsop Memorial Trust, a registered charity, was launched in 1973 with an appeal for funds, at first intending to acquire and conserve Eggardon Hill in Dorset. Instead, in 1976 the trust bought the island of Steep Holm in the Bristol Channel for \u00a310,000, and runs it as a nature reserve. The Sunday Times instituted a Kenneth Allsop Memorial Essay Competition, which took place annually until 1986. The Allsop Gallery, an exhibition space in Bridport Arts Centre, Dorset, is named after him.Kenneth Allsop was an obvious choice as a guest during the first series of the long-running naturalist radio programme Sounds Natural on BBC Radio 4 on 24 May 1971.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rubber Soul", "response": ["Lennon credited a remark made by BBC journalist Kenneth Allsop, who had asked why his songs appeared to lack the wordplay and childhood focus evident in his 1964 book In His Own Write, as the catalyst for \"In My Life\".

McCartney recalled writing the melody on his own and said that the song's musical inspiration came from Smokey Robinson and the Miracles; according to Lennon, McCartney merely assisted in writing what he called \"the middle-eight melody\".

Similar questions about the banality of his song lyrics \u2013 including from musician Bob Dylan \u2013 became common following the publication of his book, pushing him to write deeper, more introspective songs in the years that followed. In a December 1970 interview with Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone, Lennon explained that early in his career he made a conscious split between writing pop music for public consumption and the expressive writing found in In His Own Write, with the latter representing \"the personal stories... expressive of my personal emotions\"., quoted in .
