The driving, relentless figure that follows it, and the middle figure played by the basses, weren't enough for a complete piece.\" Speaking about it in the book accompanying the Larks' Tongues in Aspic: The Complete Recordings box set, he says, \"After we had just recorded the track \"Red\" in [Olympic Studios] ... we played it back and Bill said, 'I don't get it, but if you tell me it's good, I trust you.' ... I said, 'We don't have to use it.' John was in no doubt: 'We'll use it.'\" An unused variation of the song's middle section would later emerge in 1983, during the writing rehearsals for Three of a Perfect Pair. Though it went unused, it finally saw light in 1995, more than two decades later, as the middle section of the instrumental \"VROOOM VROOOM\" on THRAK.", "* Keeling, Andrew (2007).
