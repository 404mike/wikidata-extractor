He was described in  1985 by British rock magazine Sounds as the 'definitive rock drummer.'\nBorn in Oxford, King commenced his career as a teenager in the late 1960s in the Oxfordshire-based psychedelic group Opal Butterfly who produced three singles as well as contributing to the soundtrack to the film Groupie Girl, in which King had a cameo role.\nAt their demise, Opal Butterfly's frontman had been Lemmy who went on to join Hawkwind. Hawkwind were having problems with their drummer Terry Ollis so King was invited by Lemmy to play alongside Ollis, but after a couple of gigs Ollis left and his place was permanently taken up by King. His first gig as sole drummer was the Greasy Truckers Party at the Roundhouse on 13 February 1972 which was recorded and released on two various artists compilation albums and as the hit single \"Silver Machine\", earning King an appearance on Top of the Pops.\nKing remained with Hawkwind until the 1978 Hawklords album, passing his drum duties onto Martin Griffin for personal reasons. During this time he teamed up with Huw Lloyd-Langton and Nic Potter to form a three piece named Jawa, and it is this band that recorded the Steve Swindells album Fresh Blood.\nHe briefly returned to Hawkwind for their Winter 1979 tour, but quit again during the recording sessions for the Levitation album. He auditioned one final time for the 1982 Choose Your Masques tour, but being rejected he chose to leave the music business.\nAccording to Hawkwind guitarist Dave Brock, in a 1984 taped interview for Tim Gadd's radio show 'Zooks', King left the band after 1979.\nKing has two children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hawkwind", "response": ["The addition of bassist Ian \"Lemmy\" Kilmister and drummer Simon King propelled the band to greater heights. One of the early gigs the band played was a benefit for the Greasy Truckers at The Roundhouse on 13 February 1972. A live album of the concert, Greasy Truckers Party, was released, and after re-recording the vocal, a single, \"Silver Machine\", was also released, reaching number three in the UK charts. This generated sufficient funds for the subsequent album Doremi Fasol Latido Space Ritual tour. The show featured dancers Stacia and Miss Renee typically performing either topless or wearing only body paint, mime artist Tony Carrera and a light show by Liquid Len and was recorded on the elaborate package Space Ritual. At the height of their success, in 1973, the band released the single \"Urban Guerrilla\", which coincided with an IRA bombing campaign in London, so the BBC refused to play it and the band's management reluctantly decided to withdraw it fearing accusations of opportunism, despite the disc having already climbed to number 39 in the UK chart."]}, {"page": "Lemmy", "response": ["Leaving the Rockin' Vickers, Lemmy moved to London in 1967.
