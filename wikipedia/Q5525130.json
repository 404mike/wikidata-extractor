He began his career playing for his hometown club Middlesbrough, making his professional debut in April 1984. The club endured severe financial trouble during this period but Gill was part of the side that won consecutive promotions in 1987 and 1988 to reach the First Division before suffering a broken leg in 1989. He made just one further appearance for the club before joining Darlington in 1989, following a loan spell with Hull City. He later played for Cardiff City, winning the Welsh Cup in 1992, before retiring at the age of 28 due to injury.\nAfter working as a coach in the United States, Gill joined Gateshead as assistant manager before taking control of the team in February 2002 following the resignation of Paul Proudlock. He resigned from the role eight months later. After a serious car accident left him disabled, he gave up coaching and returned to his former club Middlesbrough as a scout before being made the club's head of UK recruitment.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gateshead F.C.", "response": ["|2002||Gary Gill"]}, {"page": "Dave Bennett (footballer, born 1959)", "response": ["Bennett joined Swindon Town in September 1990 for a fee of \u00a360,000.

He made his debut in a 4\u20132 win over Oxford United, however, injury misery immediately followed, with Bennett breaking his leg in only his second match for the club, following a tackle from Gary Gill, during a Football League Trophy match against Darlington. After spending a year recovering, Bennett was loaned out to Shrewsbury Town to regain full match-fitness. Astonishingly, he broke the same leg, again in his second appearance for the club, effectively ending his professional career. He later played for non-league side Nuneaton Borough."]}, {"page": "List of people from Middlesbrough", "response": ["* Gary Gill, footballer"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Middlesbrough F.C. season", "response": ["|Europe Scout|| Gary Gill"]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1990s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Gary Gill"]}, {"page": "Gary Gill (disambiguation)", "response": ["Gary Gill may refer to:", "*Gary Gill (born 1964), English footballer", "*Gary Gill (politician), Honolulu City Council Member from 1987 to 1994", "*Gary Gill, Natural Law candidate in the Washington secretary of state election, 1996"]}, {"page": "Gill, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Gill"]}]}}
