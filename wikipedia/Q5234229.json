The Government then embraced a policy of community cohesion instead. In 2011, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said in a speech that \"state multiculturalism has failed\".

In September 1960, Lennox-Boyd was raised to the peerage as Viscount Boyd of Merton of Merton-in-Penninghame in the County of Wigtown.

Being opposed to the line taken in Harold Macmillan's Wind of Change speech, Lennox-Boyd subsequently became an early patron of the right-wing Conservative Monday Club.

In Blair's own account, A Journey (in which Mandelson features hardly at all, and Gordon Brown only at the end) it is of course very different. Almost everything is driven forward by him; the new Labour project was not imminent in Britain's political history\u00a0\u2013 it had to be shaped and moulded.\" A similar theme was echoed by David Runciman in The London Review of Books, where he reflected that Mandelson's memoirs \"provide a much more complete account of the Blair/Brown relationship\", including details of Operation Teddy Bear, an aborted plot from 2003 to curb Brown's increasing influence as Chancellor by dividing the Treasury to create a separate Office of Budget and Delivery that would be controlled directly by the Cabinet Office."]}, {"page": "Wellesley House School", "response": ["* David Goodhart, political commentator and founder of Prospect"]}, {"page": "Gadi Taub", "response": ["Critical of multiculturalism and intersectionality, Taub has repeatedly criticized the tendency to excuse the oppression of women and gays by Muslim communities, as well as the attempt to silence such criticism as motivated only by Islamophobia.

The latter would be reflected, he believes, in a politico-economic model \u201cwhich combines private profit with public benefit by sharing reward, risk and responsibility amongst all stakeholders\u201d. The state's role would also have to be altered, with greater decentralisation for local communities, no more outsourcing of services to the private sector, and no more top-down reorganisation. Adrian Pabst builds on these points, proposing a \u2018civil economy\u2019 that \u201cties economic profit to ethical and social purpose\u201d and seeking to \u201cethicise exchange by instituting just prices, fair wages and non-usurious rates of interest\u201d. This must replace the current \u2018broken\u2019 UK political economy, characterised by low wages, low productivity, low innovation, low growth, and high inequality. \u2018Virtue\u2019 must be at the heart of this conception. David Goodhart takes on the next chapter's topic of immigration. \u2018Immigrationist ideology\u2019, he argues, has co-opted left-wingers onto the side of big business. Mass immigration has brought with it, he argues, social dislocation, and whilst lauded as good for the economy it has seen lower wages and a lack of employment for Britons who instead languish on unemployment assistance."]}, {"page": "Lancaster Arts at Lancaster University", "response": ["Season Butler and Proto-type theater, a lecture at The Dukes by Owen Jones and a performance of Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No 1 by Chetham's Symphony Orchestra.
