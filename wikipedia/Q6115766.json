After Jack Whitfield's lone spell as captain in the Scotland game, the Welsh were now led by Rowe Harding, though the result remained the same. In a close game at the Cardiff Arms Park, Pugh scored his only international points when he scored one of two Welsh tries, though this was not enough to gain victory over the Irish team.
