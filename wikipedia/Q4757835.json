Grant destroyed another Fokker D.VII over Cambrai, France at 1400 hours. Grant was now an ace, having scored five victories for three different pilots. Three days later, while manning the guns for Captain Andrew MacGregor, the shooting sergeant sent another Fokker D.VII down out of control into Bourlon Woods at 10 in the morning. The next day, Grant was still teamed with MacGregor. They flew two missions that day. At 1125 hours, west of Marcoing, France, Grant destroyed his third Fokker D.VII. At 1605, he destroyed his fourth D.VII west of Avesnes-le-Sec. One of that day's vanquished Fokkers burst into fire; the pilot leaped out. No parachute was spotted. Evidently, the German aviator preferred death by fall rather than by flame."]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Andrew MacGregor"]}, {"page": "1924 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Andrew MacGregor, ."]}, {"page": "1949 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Acting Air Vice-Marshal Andrew MacGregor, C.B.E., D.F.C., Royal Air Force."]}, {"page": "1932 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Flight Lieutenant Andrew MacGregor, ."]}, {"page": "1944 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Air Commodore Andrew MacGregor, ."]}, {"page": "MacGregor, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew MacGregor"]}]}}
