Royal Marines from HMS Vulture and HMS Odin tried to come ashore to deal with public property in the town \"in accordance with the usages of war\". The marines were repelled by local defenders armed with hunting rifles supported by troops, artillery and possibly Russian advisors and military. One of the 9 smaller British craft (a gunboat) fell into the hands of the defenders. As such, this boat was the only Royal Navy vessel still in foreign possession in 1914. The boat is still today a museum-object and can be seen in Kokkola's English Park. The town council has refused to return the boat despite several requests by the United Kingdom, most recently by John Stuttard, the Lord Mayor of London. The British Treasury annually pays a small sum to the local church congregation for the maintenance of the graves of nine Royal Marines killed in action during the skirmish ."]}, {"page": "Churchill College, Cambridge", "response": ["* Sir John Stuttard \u2013 a Lord Mayor of London"]}, {"page": "Shrewsbury School", "response": ["* Sir John Stuttard  (born 1945), Alderman and Lord Mayor of the City of London 2006\u201307"]}, {"page": "List of lord mayors of London", "response": ["| 2006 || Sir John Stuttard || Glazier||"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Sir John Stuttard (Churchill), Lord Mayor of London 2006/7"]}, {"page": "King Edward's School, Witley", "response": ["*Sir John Stuttard - governor"]}, {"page": "List of Old Salopians", "response": ["* Sir John Stuttard  (born 1945), Lord Mayor of the City of London 2006\u201307"]}, {"page": "Kazakhstan\u2013United Kingdom relations", "response": ["President Nazarbayev, along with several Kazakh business leaders, met with Evans, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Queen Elizabeth II, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, Lord Mayor John Stuttard and Jean Lemierre, the President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in London, England on 21 and 22 November 2006.
