The first known map showing Cape Everard was made in 1852 and published in 1853, by surveyor George Douglas Smythe. If he coined the name, then, according to one theory, he may have been referring to William Everard, a South Australian Commissioner of Crown Lands.

Yarrell gave invaluable advice and bargained with shopkeepers, so Darwin paid \u00a350 for two pistols and a rifle, while FitzRoy had spent \u00a3400 on firearms., On Sunday, 11 September, FitzRoy and Darwin took the steam packet for Portsmouth. Darwin was not seasick and had a pleasant \"sail of three days\". For the first time, he saw the \"very small\" cramped ship, met the officers, and was glad to get a large cabin, shared with the assistant surveyor John Lort Stokes. On Friday, Darwin rushed back to London, \"250 miles in 24 hours\", and on via Cambridge to arrive in Shrewsbury on 22 September for a last quick visit to family and friends, leaving for London on 2 October.
