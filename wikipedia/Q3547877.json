He promptly uses the opportunity to exact revenge on Alfie, but instead blackmails Kat into sleeping with him rather than have Alfie beaten up. Kat initially refuses, but relents when Andy says this will pay off her debts and also threatens to have Alfie killed if she does not relent to his demand. The two later go to bed together, which is secretly filmed by Andy as he had set up a hidden video camera to record everything \u2014 as part of his plan to get revenge on Alfie for ruining his wedding to Kat.

She would often go on all-night binges and has slept with many men, but calmed down in more recent years. As such, she can be described as a \"tart with a heart\" character. Her initial stint saw her involved in many storylines, most significantly in a plot twist which sees her sister Zoe (Michelle Ryan), revealed to be her daughter after she was raped by her uncle Harry (Michael Elphick) as a child. Another key aspect to the character's storylines is her marriage to Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), prior to which she became briefly engaged to Alfie's love rival Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs); after Kat jilted Andy on their wedding day, he blackmailed her into sleeping with him in his revenge bid against Alfie and Kat.

Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: \"People don't like it when Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but I do this time around.

I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game.
