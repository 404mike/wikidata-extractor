As the Harlequinade portion of the English dramatic genre pantomime developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character Clown. As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential portrayers of the Harlequin character in Victorian England were William Payne and his sons the Payne Brothers, the latter active during the 1860s and 1870s.", "*William Payne"]}, {"page": "Highgate Cemetery", "response": ["* William Payne, actor, dancer and pantomimist"]}, {"page": "Joseph Grimaldi", "response": ["Although officially retired, Grimaldi still received half of his former small salary from Drury Lane until 1824.  Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty after a number of ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him.McConnell Stott, pp. 230\u201331 Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes.  Along with Bologna, in 1827 he re-appeared briefly at Sadler's Wells where he gave some acting instruction to the mime artist William Payne, the future father of the Payne Brothers.Boase, G. C.

However, Grimaldi's health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut.McConnell Stott, pp. 272\u2013273  The early end to his career, worries about money, and the uncertainty over his son's future made him increasingly depressed. To make light of it, he would often joke about his condition: \"I make you laugh at night but am Grim-all-day\".Grimaldi (Boz edition), p. 13 In 1828, two \"farewell\" benefit performances were held for him.
