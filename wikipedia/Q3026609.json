He played on 23 occasions for his country, either as a second row or back row forward scoring two tries and captained Wales on eight occasions.\nDuring his time as Welsh captain, he lost only once, in the semi-finals of the inaugural Rugby World Cup against the eventual winners, New Zealand. However, Wales managed to beat the pre-tournament favourites, Australia, to claim third place and a bronze medal; to this date, the best performance for Wales in a Rugby World Cup. He has been quoted as saying that captaining the Welsh side at the first world cup was the \"icing on the cake\" for his career.He has been heavily involved with Swansea RFC throughout his career.\nAs a player, he holds the club's all-time record for appearances at 472 in a career spanning over 20 years from 1976\u201377 to 1997\u201398 in which he also scored 32 tries.
