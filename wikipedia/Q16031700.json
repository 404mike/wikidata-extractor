Chapple was close to Burges and was one of the executors of his will.  On Burges's death, Chapple wrote \"a constant relationship...with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students.  I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet.  He was almost all the world to me.\"  Burges's practice was inherited by his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan and Chapple worked with him on the two volumes of drawings of Burges's work which Pullan published in the mid -1880s.  Chapple also worked with Pullan and William Frame in completing a number of Burges's unfinished works, including Cardiff Castle, and Castell Coch, the fantasy palaces Burges designed for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute in South Wales.  At Castell Coch, Chapple was responsible for much of the furniture, including the elaborate suite in Lady Bute's bedroom.  He also completed St Michael's Church, Brighton.Chapple retired in 1911 and died at Barnet in 1922.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cardiff Castle", "response": ["John, 3rd Marquess of Bute, inherited the title and castle in 1848. He was then less than a year old, and as he grew up he came to despise the existing castle, believing that it represented a mediocre, half-hearted example of the Gothic style. The young Lord Bute engaged the architect William Burges to undertake the remodelling of the castle. The two shared a passion in medieval Gothic Revivalism and this, combined with Bute's huge financial resources, enabled Burges to rebuild the property on a grand scale. Burges brought with him almost of all of the team that had supported him on earlier projects, including John Starling Chapple, William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale. Burges's contribution, in particular his research into the history of the castle and his architectural imagination, was critical to the transformation."]}, {"page": "William Burges", "response": ["Burges inspired considerable loyalty within his team of assistants, and his partnerships were long-lived. John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.", "Burges died, aged 53, in his Red Bed at the Tower House, at 11.45 p.m. on Wednesday 20 April 1881. While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \"a constant relationship\u00a0... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and\u00a0... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet.

He earned a living by lecturing and authoring, writing a number of books on his travels in the Middle East and on architecture, including Elementary lectures on Christian architecture.  On Burges's' death in 1881 the Pullans inherited The Tower House in Kensington, Burges's own home.  In the following years, Pullan worked with a number of Burges's team, including John Starling Chapple and William Frame to complete some of Burges's unfinished works, including Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, the fantasy palaces Burges had begun for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute."]}, {"page": "John Chapple", "response": ["* John Starling Chapple, English stonemason and architect"]}]}}
