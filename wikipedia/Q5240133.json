Strangeways had, in the opinion of Ops(B)'s Christopher Harmer, the same arrogance as his commanding officer. More importantly, he held a low opinion of the London establishment of the \"old boys'\" clubs of Ops (B) and LCS. Dissatisfied with the Fortitude South outline, he, in the words of Harmer, set out to ride \"roughshod over the established deception organization\". Strangeways's criticisms highlighted that the plan aimed to cover the Allies' real intentions, rather than to create a realistic threat to Calais. That was not the only issue, and Strangeways was not the only one to notice them. If the Germans were able to correctly judge the Allied state of readiness in southwestern England, they would be expecting an invasion in early June, which left several weeks to defeat any bridgehead and to turn to the defence of Calais."]}, {"page": "Alsos Mission", "response": ["On reaching Brussels, they made contact with Lieutenant Colonel David Strangeways, the commander of R Force, who provided them with an escort of Royal Air Force armored vehicles. They entered Antwerp on 7 September and found the office of Union Mini\u00e8re. They discovered that over 1,000 tons of refined uranium had been sent to Germany, but about 150 tons still remained at Olen. They set out for Olen, where they located 68 tons, but another 80 tons were missing, having been shipped to France in 1940 ahead of the German invasion of Belgium. The capture of Eindhoven by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division allowed early access to another high priority target, the Philips plant there. Brigadier Edgar Williams, the 21st Army Group's Chief of Intelligence, facilitated the Alsos Mission's detour to Eindhoven, where it was able to interview Dutch scientists. Williams also furnished a detachment of Royal Engineers to transport and move the uranium from Olen. Groves had it shipped to England, and, ultimately, to the United States."]}, {"page": "Operation Quicksilver (deception plan)", "response": ["Fortitude had evolved from plans submitted by Noel Wild, head of Ops (B), and John Bevan, from the London Controlling Section in late 1943. Early revisions in January 1944 suggested a fictional build up of troops in southern England with the hope of drawing German attention to the Calais region. Colonel David Strangeways, head of Montgomery's R Force deception staff, was unimpressed with the approach. He had worked under Dudley Clarke in Cairo during the early war. There he had learned Clarke's maxim that deception relied on getting the enemy to do something, not just think something. Strangeways was widely critical of the original plan and eventually re-wrote the Fortitude deception with a focus on creating a realistic threat to the Calais region. Quicksilver was Strangeways implementation plan for Fortitude South, it consisted of six sections focused on the creation of the First United States Army Group (FUSAG)."]}, {"page": "Operation Titanic", "response": ["As D-Day approached, Allied planners moved on to tactical deceptions (roughly under the umbrella of Fortitude) to help cover the progress of the real invasion forces. The D-Day naval deceptions (Taxable and Glimmer) were planned for the eve of the Normandy landings to develop threats against the Pas-de-Calais involving No. 218 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the Royal Air Force and Harbour Defence Motor Launches of the home fleet. Titanic was intended as an accompaniment to these deceptions, as well as to create general confusion for the defending forces on the morning of D-Day. It simulated paratrooper drops (using dummies and small numbers of SAS personnel). The idea for Titanic originated from a plan submitted by David Strangeways (head of the tactical deception unit of 21st Army Group) which in turn was a rewrite of a plan from the Supreme HQ Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) Ops (B)."]}]}}
