This led him into viral classification, an important area of his work for the rest of his life. Proposals for viral classification that he made with collaborators became the basis for an international system.

While working on his doctorate in virology at Clare College, Cambridge University between 1953 and 1956, Fiset worked to decode the structure of Coxiella burnetii, the bacteria causing Q fever, with Michael Stoker. The infection typically presents symptoms such as high fever, headaches, and severe muscle aches and pains which can last for several weeks. His subsequent research as a professor at the Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and University of Maryland School of Medicine led to development of the Q fever vaccine with Australian microbiologist Barry Marmion. Theodore Woodward, writing for the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, said that an  \"important and better understanding of Q fever resulted from  the work of Dr. Paul Fiset, who showed that Q fever Rickettsiae could wear several faces, called Phase I and Phase II, a change that was important for vaccine development and accurate diagnosis\". The vaccine resulted in a protection rate of 95\u00a0percent."]}]}}
