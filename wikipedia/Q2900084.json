He joined Stockport County, and in his first season at the club (1921\u201322) won a Third Division North medal and promotion to the Second Division. He moved in March 1923 to First Division Oldham Athletic, but the club were relegated to the Second Division soon after he joined; Jones spent another two seasons with the Latics in the second flight, and then joined fellow Second Division side Nottingham Forest in the summer of 1925.\nJones steadily made a name for himself as a talented left winger with Forest, making over 100 appearances for them in three years. It was also while there that he picked up the first of his eight caps for Wales, excelling in a 3\u20131 victory over England at Selhurst Park on 1 March 1926. In addition, he went on to captain his country several times.\nJones was signed by Herbert Chapman for Arsenal in May 1928, and often played as one of the forwards as Chapman introduced the WM formation. He missed only three league games in 1929\u201330, although he was not selected for the Gunners' 1930 FA Cup-winning side.However, Jones proved his versatility by moving to right half, and became known as a tenacious ballwinner and committed tackler in the Arsenal midfield. With Arsenal he won three First Division winners' medals (in 1930\u201331, 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334), and played in the 1931\u201332 FA Cup final (which Arsenal lost controversially to Newcastle United). Towards the end of his career his age was starting to catch up with him, and competition for midfield places was fierce; with players such as Bob John and Frank Hill in the Arsenal squad, Jones only played 16 matches in 1932\u201333. However his knowledge of the game and tactical sense were still appreciated by Arsenal managers Herbert Chapman and Joe Shaw; this meant he was a regular in the 1933\u201334 season, at the end of which he retired from the game, at the age of 34. In all he played 195 games for Arsenal, scoring eight goals.\nJones was manager of Notts County from May 1934 to December 1935.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Jones", "response": ["* Charlie Jones (actor) (born 1996), EastEnders actor", "* Charlie Jones (musician) (born 1965), British bass-guitarist", "* Charlie Jones (singer) (born 1999), singer of Stereo Kicks", "* Charlie Jones (infielder) (1861\u20131922), baseball infielder", "* Charlie Jones (outfielder) (1876\u20131947), baseball outfielder", "* Charlie Jones (footballer, born 1899) (1899\u20131966), Welsh international footballer", "* Charlie Jones (footballer, born 1911) (1911\u20131985), Welsh-born footballer", "* Charlie Jones (Australian footballer) (1888\u20131946), Australian rules footballer", "* Charlie Jones (American football) (born 1972), American football player", "* Charlie Jones (rugby union, born 1880) (1880\u20131908), South African rugby union international", "* Charlie Jones (sportscaster) (1930\u20132008), American sports announcer", "* Charlie Jones, Chief Shakes VII of the Tlingit people 1916\u20131944"]}, {"page": "Jack Crayston", "response": ["Despite breaking both his wrist and leg in 1933\u201334, Crayston was signed by First Division champions Arsenal in 1934 as a replacement for Charlie Jones. He scored on his competitive debut in an 8\u20131 thrashing of Liverpool on 1 September 1934 and became a regular in the Arsenal side straight away, largely pushing Frank Hill out of the right-half spot.

He made his debut against Blackburn Rovers on 15 October 1932. At the time, Arsenal were spoilt for wing-halves and Hill competed for his place with Charlie Jones, Bob John, Wilf Copping and Jack Crayston. Despite this, Hill featured in all three of Arsenal's 1933, 1934 and 1935 League title campaigns. He also won the 1934 Charity Shield with the Gunners. Hill usually played at right-half but also deputised at left-half or even on the wing."]}, {"page": "Harry Thomas (footballer)", "response": ["During his time with United, he was capped by the Wales national football team on one occasion. His sole appearance came in a 3\u20133 draw with England, replacing Charlie Jones who was suffering from flu. After his spell at United he moved to Merthyr Town, spending two years with the side before finishing his career with Abercarn."]}]}}
