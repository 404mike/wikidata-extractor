Born in London, in 1922 he set up the Stuart Advertising Agency that worked with contemporary artists of the time such as Edward Bawden, Edward McKnight Kauffer, Ben Nicholson, and Barbara Hepworth. Menzies initially worked for Fortnum & Mason running their Invalid Delicasies Food Department before becoming a copywriter and producing the Commentaries for Fortnum & Mason - a new style of direct mail booklets illustrated by W Hendy, Menzies and Edward Bawden. The Stuart Advertising Agency were commissioned to design the logo of Imperial Airways and some of the Shell on the Road publicity for Shell-Mex & BP. Menzies's business partner, Marcus Brumwell, headed the firm when Menzies retired around 1938-9. Menzies moved with his wife, Elizabeth to Tahiti and later settled in Canada. He died in December 1959 whilst on a cruise near Gibraltar.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Bawden", "response": ["By 1930, Bawden was working one day a week for the Curwen Press, as was Ravilious and their former tutor, Nash, producing illustrations for leading companies at the time such as London Transport, Westminster Bank, Twinings, Poole Potteries, Shell-Mex, the Folio Society, Chatto & Windus, and Penguin Books. In the early 1930s he was discovered by the Stuart Advertising Agency, owned by H. Stuart Menzies and Marcus Brumwell. Around this time Bawden produced some of his most humorous and innovative work for Fortnum & Mason and Imperial Airways. He also worked for The Listener."]}, {"page": "Stuart Advertising Agency", "response": ["Although little mention of Stuart's Advertising Agency can be found in books on pre-war advertising, Stuarts was, during the 1920s and 1930s, one of the leading London advertising agencies. Located at Kingsway House, Kingsway, the firm was founded in 1922 by H. Stuart Menzies. It had accounts with Elizabeth Arden, Keiller's marmalade, Shell-Mex & BP, Speedwriting, Crosse & Blackwell, Harper's Bazaar, Imperial Airways, Indian Trans-Continental Airways, Lewis Berger Paints, Toblerone and Qantas. Menzies retired in 1938-39 and moved first to Tahiti and later to Canada with his wife Elizabeth. Marcus Brumwell joined the firm in the early 1920s and became Managing Director when Menzies retired. Two other influential figures in the organisation in the late 1930s were D Lewis and the typographer/copywriter Robert Harling . While Menzies was an exceptional copywriter, Brumwell played a key role in liaising with leading contemporary artists of the time: Edward Bawden, Ben Nicholson, Edward McKnight Kauffer and Barbara Hepworth."]}, {"page": "Marcus Brumwell", "response": ["Marcus joined H. Stuart Menzies's small advertising agency, Stuart's, in 1924, and by 1926 was its company secretary. Brumwell was later partner, specialising in liaising with contemporary artists, bringing in Edward Bawden, Edward McKnight Kauffer, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, and others to work on projects, and helping the agency grow greatly. Brumwell took over as the managing director of Stuart's when Menzies retired in 1938."]}]}}
