Lyons and Fenton's opposition to the economic policies of the Scullin Labor Government had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives, known as \"the Group\", whose number included future prime minister Robert Menzies. In parliament on 13 March 1931, though still a member of the ALP, Lyons supported a no confidence motion against the Scullin Labor government.  Soon afterward, Lyons, Fenton and four other right-wing Labor MPs--Moses Gabb, Allan Guy, Charles McGrath and John Price\u2014resigned from the ALP in protest of the Scullin government's economic policies.  Five of the six Labor dissidents\u2013all except Gabb\u2013formed the All for Australia League and crossed over to the opposition benches. On 7 May, the All for Australia League, the Nationalist opposition (hitherto led by John Latham) and former Prime Minister Billy Hughes' Australian Party (a group of former Nationalists who had been expelled for crossing the floor and bringing down Stanley Bruce's Nationalist government in 1929), merged to form the UAP. Although the new party was dominated by former Nationalists, Lyons was chosen as the new party's leader, and thus became Leader of the Opposition, with Latham as his deputy. The Western Australia branch of the Nationalists, however, retained the Nationalist name."]}, {"page": "Division of Boothby", "response": ["| rowspan=3 | John Price"]}, {"page": "List of Australian federal by-elections", "response": ["|John Price"]}, {"page": "Agent-general", "response": ["* John Price, 1925\u20131928"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Port Adelaide", "response": ["| rowspan=4|John Price"]}, {"page": "1931 Australian federal election", "response": ["| John Price", "| John Price"]}, {"page": "1928 Australian federal election", "response": ["| John Price"]}, {"page": "John Price", "response": ["John Price may refer to:", "*John Price (Australian footballer) (born 1944), Australian rules footballer for Hawthorn", "*John Price (bowls) (born 1960), Welsh lawn and indoor bowler", "*John Price (cricketer, born 1908) (1908\u20131995), English cricketer", "*John Price (cricketer, born 1937), English cricketer, played in 15 Tests, 1964\u20131972", "*John Price (footballer, born 1854) (1854\u20131907), Welsh international footballer", "*John Price (footballer, born 1936), Welsh footballer with Liverpool, Aston Villa, Walsall and Shrewsbury Town", "*John Price (sailor) (1920\u20131991), American Olympic sailor", "*John Price (MP for Liskeard), in 1402, MP for Liskeard", "*John Price (MP for Cardiganshire) (died 1584), Welsh politician", "*John Price (died 1555) (1502\u20131555), MP for Breconshire, Hereford, Ludlow and Ludgershall", "*John Price (died 1602), Welsh politician", "*John Price (MP for Flint Boroughs) (?1570\u20131656), MP for Flint Boroughs", "*John Price (MP for Cardiff), Welsh politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1654 and 1659", "*John Price (New South Wales politician) (born 1939), Australian politician, state parliamentary member for Waratah and Maitland, New South Wales", "*John Price (South Australian politician) (1882\u20131941), Australian politician and MHR for Boothby, South Australia", "*John Price (Canadian politician) (1883\u20131956), Canadian politician, member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia", "*John Price (diplomat) (born 1934), former United States Ambassador to Mauritius and the Seychelles", "*John Price (1943\u20131987), English actor in Sam", "*John Price (Danish actor) (1913\u20131996), Danish actor", "*John Price (Welsh scholar) (1502\u20131555), author of the first book to be printed in Welsh", "*John Price (classical scholar) (1602\u20131676), classical scholar, publisher and collector of books", "* John Price, the African American man of the 1858 Oberlin\u2013Wellington Rescue", "*John Price (British Army officer) (died 1747), general", "*John Price (executioner) (c. 1677\u20131718), English executioner", "*John Price (librarian) (1735\u20131813), Welsh librarian and Anglican priest", "*Captain John Price (Call of Duty), a fictional character in the Call of Duty series"]}, {"page": "Emergency Committee of South Australia", "response": ["In the House of Representatives, the Emergency Committee took an additional two seats, Adelaide and Grey, to win six of the state's seven seats.
