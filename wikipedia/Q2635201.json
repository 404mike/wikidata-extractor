She was the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924\u20131992), and Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (n\u00e9e Roche; 1936\u20132004). The Spencer family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations; her grandmothers, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer and Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, had served as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Her parents were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances after her mother and after Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales. Within the family, she was also known informally as \"Duch\", a reference to her duchess-like attitude in childhood."]}, {"page": "Althorp", "response": ["The Grandmother's Sitting Room is situated at the front of the eastern wing. It is noted for its deep blue hand-painted frescoes and formal furniture, and was the favourite room of Charles and Diana's grandmother, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer. Nearby was the Muniment Room in which the Spencer family records were kept, described as a \"musty apartment\" which contained over 500 years of history, from medieval household accounts to letters from Jacobeans and accounts of Victorian house parties. The room was a favourite haunt of Spencer's grandfather, Albert Spencer, who would spend thousands of hours in it perusing over the family history. So guarded was he of the collection that when Winston Churchill once spent time in the room looking for information on his ancestor, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650\u20131722), Albert immediately doused out his cigar in fear of creating a fire. The records were sold to the British Library in the 1980s, leaving the room empty, before it was converted to what is known as the \"Steward's Room Flat\". This part of the house once had an extensive collection of 1830s bull paintings by Richard Ansdell."]}, {"page": "Duke of Abercorn", "response": ["*James Albert Edward Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn (1869\u20131953), eldest son of the 2nd Duke.
