With Dave Barry announcing his intention to step down as manager of Cork City at the end of the 1999\u20132000 League of Ireland season, Murphy emerged as the favoured candidate to succeed him. He was duly appointed and led the club in their first game of the 2000\u201301 season, a Super Cup clash with Bohemians on 30 June 2000, but resigned a week later to become Football Co-ordinator at Premiership Club Leicester City working under their newly appointed manager Peter Taylor."]}, {"page": "Jack Ashurst", "response": ["Ashurst made his debut the following month, in a draw at Gillingham, replacing the veteran Peter Suddaby at centre-half."]}, {"page": "Graham Westley", "response": ["Westley was born in Hounslow, London and he started his footballing career as an apprentice with Queens Park Rangers. During his time at QPR, Westley represented England at under-18 level. He then joined Gillingham in March 1986. He made two Third Division appearances for the club before joining Barnet. He made three appearances and scored one goal for them in the Football Conference during the 1987\u201388 season, making his debut for the club in a 2\u20132 draw against Macclesfield Town at Moss Rose. Westley joined Wycombe Wanderers in the latter stages of 1987 for a fee of \u00a37,500, making a scoring debut in a 2\u20131 away victory at Telford United. He scored in Wycombe's next two games, and was a first team regular until manager Peter Suddaby left the club in January 1988. Westley played just once under new manager Jim Kelman and left soon afterwards to sign for Kingstonian. He played 24 times for Wycombe, scoring five goals in all competitions during the club's 1987\u201388 campaign. He later played for a number of non-League clubs, including Kingstonian, Wealdstone, Farnborough Town, Harlow Town, Enfield, Aylesbury United, Harrow Borough, Tooting & Mitcham United, Molesey and Walton & Hersham \u2013 three of which he would later go on to manage. He was voted Player of the Season at Enfield, before being swapped to Aylesbury in exchange for Darren Collins in December 1992. During his time at Kingstonian, he suffered a dislocated ankle and broken leg in three places, which subsequently cut his playing career short as he never fully recovered from the injury."]}, {"page": "History of Wycombe Wanderers F.C.", "response": ["In December 1968 Barry Darvill resigned and the club approached Brian Lee, upon a recommendation from the Football Association. Brian Lee was appointed in December and took charge of his first game on 28 December 1968, a 0\u20130 draw at Clapton Lee's appointed was a real watershed moment for the club and within a month Lee was picking the team and the Selection Committee was disbanded. Lee's impact was even greater, and he started to rebuild the team in the summer of 1969. The reserve side was disbanded, due to limited resources. The quartered kit were also changed, the side wearing plain Cambridge blue shirts and Oxford blue shorts. Geoff Anthony, Peter Suddaby, John Delaney, Johnny Hutchinson and Keith Searle all joined the club and the side finished as runners-up in the league to Enfield Wanderers legend Len Worley played his last game for the club, as a substitute in a 1\u20130 win at Croydon Amateurs on 13 December 1969. He played 512 games for Wycombe, scoring 67 goals. Ted Powell, Larry Pritchard and Paul Fuschillo joined the club in the summer of 1970 and a hugely talented team won the club's third Isthmian League title, pipping Sutton United to the Championship by just one point. The quarter-finals of the FA Amateur Cup were reached again, but Skelmersdale United stunned at 10,203 crowd winning 3\u20130 at Loakes Park. The title was retained the following season as the side flew out of the traps, losing just one of its first 22 league matches, scored 102 goals in 40 games. The club was, however, determined to repeat its one and only FA Amateur Cup triumph and Aveley, Spennymoor United, Walton and Hersham and Hayes were beaten as the Blues reached the semi-final. It was played at Griffin Park, Brentford, scene of defeat in the semi-final of 1950. The opponents this time were Isthmian League rivals Hendon Wycombe were missing the influential Larry Pritchard through injury. The majority of the 9,210 crowd travelled from High Wycombe and they were aghast to see the Dons take the lead against the run of play after 14 minutes. Johnny Hutchinson equalised on 60 minutes but Hendon grabbed a winner with a lon-range shot that stood despite appeals that a Hendon player was in an offside position.", "The joy of a return to the GM Vauxhall Conference was soon replaced by dismay when Alan Gane resigned after falling out with the new board. Gane wanted to sign some of the top players in non-league football but Chairman Brian Lee rejected the proposals as he was concerned that the wage bill would spiral out of control.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887\u20131996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 64. . Former player Peter Suddaby was appointed as Gane's replacement and a 4\u20130 defeat at home to Stafford Rangers on the opening day was a sign of things to come. Worse was to follow when iconic striker Noel Ashford was sold to Barnet for a then record non-league fee of \u00a317,000. Dismay soon turned to disgust as local rivals Aylesbury United knocked the Blues out of the FA Cup in the first qualifying round, winning 2\u20130 at Buckingham Road. The nadir followed when Ashford returned to Loakes Park with Barnet and humiliated the home side with a 7\u20130 thrashing. Things improved slightly and the team hovered just above the relegation zone but a 5\u20131 thrashing at the hands of Maidstone United at Loakes Park on 2 January 1988 was the final straw. The club asked for the managers resignation and Peter Suddaby fell on his sword. The board came up with a short-list of two men for the vacancy, Jim Kelman and Martin O'Neill. Only two of the seven directors voted for O'Neill and Jim Kelman was the surprise choice. His first game in charge was a thrilling 5\u20133 win at home to Cheltenham Town and it proved to be a real catalyst as the new boss slowly guided the team to 18th place, nine points clear of relegation.Finch, D & Peart, S.
