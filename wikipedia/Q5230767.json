He became frustrated at the lack of privacy at his home when ramblers deviated from a pathway to take photographs of his dwelling. Clarkson's property bordered a small 250-metre strip of land that had no definitive status as a public right of way but was used by walkers regardless. Clarkson aimed to close access to this small strip of his land, thereby forcing ramblers to take a small diversion to stick to the official public right of way and therefore protecting his claimed right to privacy on his own property. In May 2010 the former transport minister, Hon. David Anderson MHK, accepted the conclusions of a public inquiry that all except five of the paths claimed at the inquiry as public rights of way have been dedicated as public rights of way and should be added to the definitive map."]}, {"page": "Richard Corkill", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|\u00a0||align=\"left\"|David Anderson||align=\"left\"|2004\u20132006", "In what would have been a mid term shake up, Mr Corkill replaced MLCs Clare Christian and Pamela Crowe who has come under fire as Health and DLGE ministers respectively.
