After his death, his widow Rose sold the items to many museums. The British Museum has 138 items relating to Robinson's time in Australia, including Aboriginal artefacts, prints and drawings. Joseph Barnard Davis acquired many from Robinson's widow in the 1860s, and it may be through his activities that objects subsequently found their way into other collections, for example at the British Museum. Leeds Discovery Centre has two spears he collected. The Pitt Rivers Museum holds nineteen objects relating to Robinson's time abroad. The collection at Pitt Rivers includes several paintings and prints describing individual people from Aboriginal communities, including: Truggernana, Jenny, and Fanny, amongst others."]}, {"page": "1865 in archaeology", "response": ["*Joseph Barnard Davis and John Thurnam complete publication of Crania Britannica: delineations and descriptions of the skulls of the aboriginal and early inhabitants of the British islands."]}, {"page": "Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Br\u00e9au", "response": ["*Crania Ethnica, jointly with Ernest Hamy (2 vols., with 100 plates, 1875\u201382), a classical work based on French and foreign anthropological data, analogous to the Crania of John Thurnam and Joseph Barnard Davis, and to Samuel George Morton's Crania Americana and Crania Aegyptiaca."]}, {"page": "John Thurnam", "response": ["After his move to Wiltshire he gave special consideration to craniology.
