They recorded the album Songs For Sale in 1981, but were disappointed with the results and disbanded soon after; members of the band, without Godard, went on to form JoBoxers. Godard also recorded an LP at Olympic Studios, called T.R.O.U.B.L.E., with a group of London jazz musicians known as Working Week, which was eventually released two years later by Rough Trade Records."]}, {"page": "Sonic Mook Experiment", "response": ["The Sonic Mook Experiment is a music enterprise overseen by Sean McLusky which encompasses a club night and several albums."]}, {"page": "Bernard Rhodes", "response": ["Sean McLusky said that Rhodes gave him a break at Club Left in 1981 and then got a deal and success for his band JoBoxers, who enjoyed mainstream success on both sides of the Atlantic with their single \"Just Got Lucky\".
