The trio performed under the name Flowers, then Bullitt, but were not commercially successful. After hearing their covers of chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment. While in France, Gilmour contributed lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film Two Weeks in September, starring Brigitte Bardot. In May, Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new equipment. During his stay, he watched Pink Floyd record \"See Emily Play\" and was shocked to find that Barrett, who was beginning to suffer mental health problems, did not seem to recognise him. When Bullitt returned to England later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry onto the landing.", "On 6 March 2006, Gilmour's 60th birthday, he released his third solo album, On an Island. It debuted at number 1 in the UK charts, and reached the top five in Germany and Sweden. The album earned Gilmour his first US top-ten as a solo artist, reaching number six in Billboard 200. Produced by Gilmour along with Phil Manzanera and Chris Thomas, the album features orchestrations by renowned Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner, and lyrics principally written by Gilmour's wife Polly Samson. The album featured David Crosby and Graham Nash performing backing vocals on the title-track, Robert Wyatt on cornet and percussion, and Richard Wright on Hammond organ and providing backing vocals. Other contributors included Jools Holland, Georgie Fame, Andy Newmark, B. J. Cole, Chris Stainton, Willie Wilson, Rado 'Bob' Klose on guitar and Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer on piano. The album also featured Gilmour's debut with the saxophone. Gilmour toured Europe, US and Canada from 10 March to 31 May 2006 to promote On an Island. There were ten shows in the US and Canadian leg of the tour. Pink Floyd alumnus Richard Wright, and frequent Floyd collaborators Dick Parry, Guy Pratt, and Jon Carin also accompanied him on the tour. More shows took place in Europe from July to August in 2006. In a press release to promote the tour, Gilmour stated: \"I'm rather hoping that with this tour announcement, people will believe me when I say, honestly, this is the only band I plan to tour with!\""]}, {"page": "William Wilson", "response": ["* Willie Wilson (footballer, born 1894) (1894\u20131956), Scottish footballer, played for Hearts and Cowdenbeath", "* Willie Wilson (footballer, born 1941) (1941\u20132001), Scottish footballer", "* Willie Wilson (footballer, born 1972), Scottish footballer", "* Willie Wilson (baseball) (born 1955), American baseball outfielder", "* Willie Wilson (drummer) (born 1947), member of Quiver; worked with Pink Floyd, Al Stewart", "* Willie Wilson (businessman) (born 1948), Chicago businessman, musician, philanthropist, and political candidate"]}, {"page": "Jokers Wild (band)", "response": ["Clive Welham, who was having difficulty drumming because of a wrist injury, left in April 1966 and was replaced on drums by Willie Wilson (who had previously played in the HiFi's and the Newcomers).", "David Gilmour joined Pink Floyd early in 1968, after working as a deliveryman for Quorum, a fashion house.

Jones arrived there to find that Barrett had brought in friends of his as support musicians: Jerry Shirley, drummer with Humble Pie, and Willie Wilson, Jokers Wild's drummer, although for this occasion he was playing bass. The problem with this new set-up, though, was that the songs were recorded as Barrett played them live in the studio; on the released versions, a number of them have false starts and commentaries from Barrett. The first track Barrett and his fellow musicians worked on was \"No Man's Land\", after Barrett had played through the song several times, to allow Shirley and Wilson to pick up the segments. Once the rehearsal was through, they went for a take, to check how the band sounded and to test the equipment from within the control room. After these tests, the band recorded three takes, the last of which became the master take for \"No Man's Land\"; the bass, however, was re-recorded at a later date. Playing along with Barrett wasn't easy, according to Jones: \"It was a case of following him, not playing with him.
