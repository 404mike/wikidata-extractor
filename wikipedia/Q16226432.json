In his younger days he romanced a string of girlfriends and led a laddish life before settling down to marry Pat, with whom he now runs a fully organic establishment at Bridge Farm. Despite owning an MG sports car, bought with a windfall from his mother, he is generally considered to be a rather dull man. His brother-in-law Brian Aldridge enjoys winding him up over farming matters, and dinner parties involving the two couples usually end in tears. Pat and Tony had three children, John, Helen and Tom. John was killed in a tractor accident. Helen had a baby boy, Henry Ian Archer, through AI, a decision of which Tony initially disapproved. Tom runs a sausage business and makes pork ready meals under the Tom Archer brand. Tony suffered a heart attack in late February 2012, and a serious farmyard accident in autumn 2014. Having recovered from both, he now takes more of a back seat in the family business."]}, {"page": "List of longest-serving soap opera actors", "response": ["| Colin Skipp || Tony Archer || The Archers || 1967\u20132013 ||  years || "]}, {"page": "2019 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*21 November \u2013 Colin Skipp, 80, actor (The Archers)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2019", "response": ["*Colin Skipp, 80, British actor (The Archers).Colin Skipp: Former The Archers actor, who played Tony Archer, dies"]}, {"page": "Pat Archer", "response": ["Pat Lewis was born on January 10, 1952.
