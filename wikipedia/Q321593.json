Lennon said, \"I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming.\" In the words of biographer Barry Miles, \"Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock 'n' roll.\" The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon \"had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice! ... put something on it... Make it different.'\" Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques."]}, {"page": "The Who", "response": ["By 1968 the Who had started to attract attention in the underground press. Townshend had stopped using drugs and became interested in the teachings of Meher Baba. In August, he gave an interview to Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner describing in detail the plot of a new album project and its relationship to Baba's teachings. The album went through several names during recording, including Deaf Dumb and Blind Boy and Amazing Journey; Townshend settled on Tommy for the album about the life of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and his attempt to communicate with others. Some songs, such as \"Welcome\" and \"Amazing Journey\", were inspired by Baba's teaching, and others came from observations within the band. \"Sally Simpson\" is about a fan who tried to climb on stage at a gig by the Doors that they attended and \"Pinball Wizard\" was written so that New York Times journalist Nik Cohn, a pinball enthusiast, would give the album a good review. Townshend later said, \"I wanted the story of Tommy to have several levels\u00a0... a rock singles level and a bigger concept level\", containing the spiritual message he wanted as well as being entertaining. The album was projected for a Christmas 1968 release but recording stalled after Townshend decided to make a double album to cover the story in sufficient depth."]}, {"page": "Saturday Night Fever", "response": ["Saturday Night Fever is a 1977 American dance drama film directed by John Badham and produced by Robert Stigwood. It stars John Travolta as Tony Manero, a young Italian-American man from Brooklyn who spends his weekends dancing and drinking at a local discoth\u00e8que while dealing with social tensions and general restlessness and disillusionment with his life as he feels directionless and trapped in his working-class ethnic neighborhood. The story is based upon \"Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night\", an article by music writer Nik Cohn, first published in a June 1976 issue of New York magazine. The film features music by Bee Gees and many other prominent artists of the disco era.", "Norman Wexler's screenplay was adapted from a 1976 New York magazine article by British writer Nik Cohn, \"Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night\". Although presented as an account of factual reporting, Cohn acknowledged in the mid-1990s that he fabricated most of the article. A newcomer to the United States and a stranger to the disco lifestyle, Cohn was unable to make any sense of the subculture he had been assigned to write about; instead, the character who became Tony Manero was based on an English mod acquaintance of Cohn."]}, {"page": "Prince (musician)", "response": ["Journalist Nik Cohn described him as \"rock's greatest ever natural talent\". Prince was a natural tenor, but he had a wide vocal range from falsetto to baritone, and performed rapid, seemingly effortless shifts of register. Prince was also renowned as a multi-instrumentalist. He is considered a guitar virtuoso and a master of drums, percussion, bass, keyboards, and synthesizer. On his first five albums, he played nearly all the instruments, including 27 instruments on his debut album, among them various types of bass, keyboards and synthesizers. Prince was also quick to embrace technology in his music, making pioneering use of drum machines like the Linn LM-1 on his early '80s albums and employing a wide range of studio effects. The LA Times also noted his \"harnessing [of] new-generation synthesizer sounds in service of the groove,\" laying the foundations for post-'70s funk music. Prince was also known for his prolific and virtuosic tendencies, which resulted in him recording large amounts of unreleased material."]}, {"page": "The Beatles (album)", "response": ["Among the less favourable critiques, Time magazine's reviewer wrote that The Beatles showcased the \"best abilities and worst tendencies\" of the Beatles, as it is skilfully performed and sophisticated, but lacks a \"sense of taste and purpose\". William Mann of The Times opined that, in their over-reliance on pastiche and \"private jokes\", Lennon and McCartney had ceased to progress as songwriters, yet he deemed the release to be \"The most important musical event of the year\" and acknowledged: \"these 30 tracks contain plenty to be studied, enjoyed and gradually appreciated more fully in the coming months.\" In his review for The New York Times, Nik Cohn considered the album \"boring beyond belief\" and said that over half of its songs were \"profound mediocrities\".  In a 1971 column, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described the album as both \"their most consistent and probably their worst\", and referred to its songs as a \"pastiche of musical exercises\". Nonetheless, he ranked it as the tenth best album of 1968 in his ballot for Jazz & Pop magazine's annual critics poll."]}, {"page": "Brian Wilson", "response": ["For the remainder of 1968, Wilson's songwriting output declined substantially, as did his emotional state, leading him to self-medicate with the excessive consumption of food, alcohol, and drugs. Amid the looming financial insolvency of the Beach Boys, he began to supplement his regular use of amphetamines and marijuana with cocaine. Hutton recalled that Wilson expressed suicidal wishes at the time, and that it was when his \"real decline started\". In mid-1968, Wilson was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, possibly of his own volition. His issues were not disclosed to the public, and sessions for 20/20 (February 1969) continued in his absence. Journalist Nik Cohn, writing in 1968, said that Wilson had been rumored to be \"increasingly withdrawn, brooding, hermitic\u00a0... and occasionally, he is to be seen in the back of some limousine, cruising around Hollywood, bleary and unshaven, huddled way tight into himself.\""]}, {"page": "Pet Sounds", "response": ["It is sometimes suggested that the tracks follow a formal narrative that documents the unraveling of a romantic relationship. Critics Richard Goldstein and Nik Cohn noted a disparity between the album's music and lyrics. Cohn suggested that Pet Sounds was composed of \"sad songs about loneliness and heartache; sad songs even about happiness.\" Rolling Stone editor David Wild compared the lyrics to the songs of Tin Pan Alley: \"intelligent and moving, but they're not pretentious.\" Journalist Seth Rogovoy felt that Pet Sounds \"upends and overturns every Beach Boys clich\u00e9, exposing the hollowness at their core.\""]}, {"page": "Tommy (The Who album)", "response": ["The Who took a break from recording at the end of 1968 to tour, including a well received appearance at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus on 10 December. They resumed sessions at IBC in January 1969, block booking Monday to Thursday, but had to do gigs every weekend to stop going further into debt. A major tour was booked for the end of April, and the group's management insisted that the album would have to be finished by then, as it had been well over a year since The Who Sell Out. Kit Lambert wrote a script, Tommy (1914\u20131984) which he professionally printed, and gave copies to the band, which helped them focus the storyline, and also decide to make the album a double. The group were still coming up with new material; Lambert insisted that the piece should have a proper overture, while Townshend wrote \"Pinball Wizard\" so that Nik Cohn, a pinball fan, would give the album a favourable review in the New York Times.

Jonathan Eisen of Circus magazine felt that it flowed better than Tommy and that not since that album had there been one \"quite so incredibly heavy, so inspired with the kind of kinetic energy that The Who have managed to harness here.\" Greil Marcus, writing in Rolling Stone, was less enthusiastic and said that, while Townshend's packaging for the album was \"a tour-de-force of the rock and roll imagination\", the music was dated and uneventful.

He was a scholar and research student at Christ Church between 1933 and 1939, taking a first-class degree in Modern Languages in 1936 (French) and in 1939 (German). He served for six years in the British Army, being commissioned into the Queen's Royal Regiment in 1939 and transferring to the Intelligence Corps in 1944, where his knowledge of modern languages found employment. In 1941 he married Vera Broido, with whom he had a son, the writer Nik Cohn. In the immediate post-war period, he was stationed in Vienna, ostensibly to interrogate Nazis, but he also encountered many refugees from Stalinism, and the similarities in persecutorial obsessions evinced both by Nazism and Stalinism fueled his interest in the historical background for these ideologically opposed, yet functionally similar movements.
