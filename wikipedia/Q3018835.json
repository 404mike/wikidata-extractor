He was an emeritus professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\nStronach was an expert on the city of Pasargadae. He was educated at Gordonstoun and St John's College, Cambridge, from which he obtained a Master of Arts in 1958. In the 1960s and 1970s he was director of the British Institute of Persian Studies in Tehran. In the 1990s, he excavated several parts of Nineveh. His scholarship earned him several honours and awards, including the invitation to deliver endowed lectures at Harvard and Columbia. He was also the recipient of the 2004 Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) Gold Medal for \"Distinguished Archaeological Achievement\".During his time in Iran, he met Ruth Vaadia (1937\u20132017), an Israeli archaeologist who was also working in Iran, and married her in 1966. They have two daughters, Keren and Tami. The family left at the time of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. He became a professor at Berkeley in 1981 and retired in 2004. Stronach's daughter Tami played the role of \"The Childlike Empress\" in the 1984 film The NeverEnding Story.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nineveh", "response": ["The British archaeologist and Assyriologist Professor David Stronach of the University of California, Berkeley conducted a series of surveys and digs at the site from 1987 to 1990, focusing his attentions on the several gates and the existent mudbrick walls, as well as the system that supplied water to the city in times of siege.

The excavations started in 1967 with David Stronach as the director. The remains of four main buildings in the site are \"the central temple, the western temple, the fort, and the columned hall\" which according to Stronach were likely to have been built in the order named and predate the latter occupation of the first half of the 6th century BC. According to Stronach, the central temple, with its stark design, \"provides a notable, if mute, expression of religious belief and practice\". A number of ceramics from the Median levels at Tepe Nush-i Jan have been found which are associated with a period (the second half of the 7th century BC) of power consolidation in the Hamad\u0101n areas. These findings show four different wares known as \"common ware\" (buff, cream, or light red in colour and with gold or silver mica temper) including jars in various size the largest of which is a form of ribbed pithoi. Smaller and more elaborate vessels were in \"grey ware\", (these display smoothed and burnished surface). The \"cooking ware\" and \"crumbly ware\" are also recognized each in single handmade products.", ":The site is located 13\u00a0km east of Kang\u0101var city on the left bank of the river Gamas \u0100b\". The excavations, started in 1965, were led by T. C. Young, Jr. which according to David Stronach, evidently shows an important Bronze Age construction that was reoccupied sometime before the beginning of the Iron III period. The excavations of Young indicate the remains of part of a single residence of a local ruler which later became quite substantial. This is similar to those mentioned often in Assyrian sources."]}, {"page": "List of Iranians", "response": ["* David Stronach"]}, {"page": "Pasargadae", "response": ["Pasargadae ( from Old Persian P\u0101\u03b8ra-gad\u0101, \"protective club\" or \"strong club\";\"BATRAKATA\u0160,\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, online edition, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/batrakatas-place-name-which-appears-on-the-elamite-fortification-tablets-found-at-persepolis-apparently-the-same-as-pasargaDavid Stronach and Hilary Gopnik, \"PASARGADAE,\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, online edition, 2009, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/pasargadae Modern Persian:  P\u0101s\u0101rg\u0101d) was the capital of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great (559\u2013530 BCE), who ordered its construction and the location of his tomb.

There are high mountains between the Black Sea and Dar'yal having deep gorges which cannot allow large armies to pass through them. Between Derbent and Dar'yal, however, there are no such mountains and the passes also are wide and passable. In ancient times savage hordes from the north invaded and ravaged southern lands through these passes and the Persian rulers who were fearful of them had to build a strong wall, 50 miles long, 29 feet high and 10 feet wide, for fortification purposes, ruins of which can still be seen (e.g. Great Wall of Gorgan).UC Berkeley's page on archaeologist David Stronach:  Though it has not yet been established historically who built this wall in the beginning, Muslim historians and geographers assign it to Dhul-Qarnain because its remains correspond with the description of it given in the Quran, despite the fact that the wall is in fact Sassanid in origins, and thus is about 1000 years too late to have been built by Cyrus. \"The OSL and radiocarbon samples demonstrated conclusively that both walls had been built in the 5th or, possibly, 6th century AD\".Omrani Rekavandi, H., Sauer, E., Wilkinson, T. & Nokandeh, J.

Since it is very similar to the Tomb of Cyrus and some of the mausoleums of Lycia and Caria in shape, solidness of architecture and having a small room with a very heavy door, it is considered a mausoleum. Welfram Klyse and David Stronach believe that the Achaemenid structures in Pasargadae and Naqsh-e Rustam might have been influenced by Urartian art in the tower-like temples of Urartu. Aristobulus, one of the retainers of Alexander III of Macedon, mentions the structure known as \"Solomon's Prison\" as \"the tower-like mausoleum\" while describing Pasargadae; and if the mentioned structure is presumed the mausoleum of one of the Achaemenid shahs, due to its similarity to the structure Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, and as Franz Heinrich Wei\u00dfbach and Alexander Demandt have explained, the structure should inevitably be considered belonging to another one of the Achaemenid shahs. Besides that, Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is a near to the mausoleums that were built at the same time; and all of them were later separated from the other parts of Naqsh-e Rustam by a chain of fortifications, indicating that they were all originally the same type and had similar applications. In other words, all of them, including they very Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, were mausoleums of Achaemenid grandees."]}, {"page": "Phoebe A.
