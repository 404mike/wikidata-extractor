Originally a teacher at Cheltenham College and later a headmaster, he became a member of Cheltenham Borough council, serving as mayor during the 1930s, before he was elected as an Independent Conservative Member of Parliament for the Cheltenham constituency at a by-election in 1937, the local Conservative party having refused to endorse him as its candidate following an anti-semitic whispering campaign.  He was re-elected at the general election of 1945 as a National Independent, but at the 1950 election his vote fell and he lost the seat to the Conservative candidate William Hicks Beach, coming third behind the Labour candidate.\nLipson was made an Alderman, and in 1953 an honorary Freeman of the Borough of Cheltenham.\nA road on the Hesters Way housing estate in Cheltenham was named after him\nHe was also an enthusiastic supporter and a vice president of the Cheltenham YMCA.", "link_mentions": {}}}
