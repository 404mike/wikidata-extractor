Risbridger was the first of three players who Webb signed from his former club, Barrington Belgrave and Ben Smith joined later. Risbridger commented on playing under Webb saying, \"I worked with him at Yeovil and he gave me my chance there last year. Now I'm looking forward to playing under him again and establishing myself with Southend.\" During the 2001\u201302 season, he made one appearance for Southend. On 11 August, Risbridger made his debut for Southend in their 1\u20130 home win over Darlington, replacing Mark Rawle as a substitute in the 89th minute, who had previously replaced Dean Holness. He joined Dover Athletic on loan in October, where he made three appearances in the Conference National. Risbridger was not allowed to play in Dover Athletic's FA Cup fourth qualifying round match against Hereford United, as Southend did not want him to become cup-tied. He was released from Southend in January 2002, by new manager Rob Newman along with Shane Wardley and Ed Chibogu."]}]}}
