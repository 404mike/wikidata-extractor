Roger senior had made a solemn pact with his close friend Robert D'Oilly, a Norman noble who had come to England with him, that they would share equally any benefits they might gain. So when Robert acquired land by marriage to a Saxon heiress, he gave to Roger a parcel of land in Oxfordshire which Roger called the Barony of Yvry, after their home in Normandy. He acquired other land in due course in several counties. He was also made hereditary Chief Butler to King William, as he had been in Normandy. \nOn his father's death in 1079, Roger junior inherited his lands in Normandy and England, including the Barony of Ivry in Oxfordshire, and the title of Chief Butler. Whilst serving under King William in Normandy, he prevented the King's eldest son Robert from seizing the town of Rouen after a quarrel with his father the King. However, when William's younger son William Rufus seized the English throne after William's death in 1087, Roger sided with Robert as the rightful heir. When William Rufus was ultimately crowned Roger fled to Normandy and died there soon afterwards. His lands were seized by the crown but later partially restored to Roger's brother Geoffrey and sister Adelisa. The title of hereditary Chief Butler was awarded to the d'Aubigny family.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chief Butler of England", "response": ["*Roger Perceval (1079\u20131087)"]}, {"page": "Roger d'Ivry", "response": ["Roger d'Ivry or d'Ivri or Rog'ive or Roger Perceval (died 1079) was an 11th-century nobleman from Ivry-la-Bataille in Normandy.The Domesday Book Online: G-I He was the younger son of Robert de Breval and his wife, Albreda, daughter of Rodolph, Lord of Ivry."]}]}}
