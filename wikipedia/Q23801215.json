She was a promising international athlete and in 1994 represented her country of birth; at the\nIAAF World Road Relay Championships, in both 3000m and 10000m at the World Junior Championships in Athletics, IAAF World Cross Country Championships and African Junior Athletics Championships.\nAt the age of 17 she was assaulted by a soldier because she was one of the minority Amhara ethnic group, while the ruling party in Ethiopia was Tigrayan. \nLater that year she flew to the UK as part of the Ethiopian junior cross country team for the 1995 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. Birhan finished fifth in the race and along with Alemitu Bekele(7th), Yemenashu Taye(8th) and Ayelech Worku(11th) took the silver medal in the team event. Early the following morning Dagne took a train to London, with fellow athletes Askale Bireda and Getenesh Tamirat, to seek political asylum.\nThe UK Government refused asylum to the athletes, but Dagne and Bireda successfully appealed against this decision.During this time the asylum seeking Ethiopian athletes trained at the Woodford Green with Essex Ladies athletic club.\nThe IAAF approved her changes of allegiance on 1 December 1998 and soon after represented Great Britain at the 1999 IAAF World Cross Country Championships.\nDagne became a member of the London-based Belgrave Harriers athletics club and ran in many domestic Half-Marathon and Marathon races.\nIn 2004 Dagne finished less than a minute behind the first Briton, a relatively unknown, Tracey Morris in the London Marathon. This performance meant she just missed out on a trip to the 2004 Olympic Games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reading Half Marathon", "response": ["| Birhan Dagne"]}, {"page": "List of eligibility transfers in athletics", "response": ["|Birhan Dagne || || || 1998"]}, {"page": "Hastings Half Marathon", "response": ["|Birhan Dagne", "|Birhan Dagne", "|Birhan Dagne"]}, {"page": "2001 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  \u2014  || Birhan Dagne ||  || DNF ||"]}, {"page": "1995 IAAF World Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|   5 || align=left | Birhan Dagne || align=left |  || 14:25", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Birhan Dagne || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 5"]}, {"page": "1994 IAAF World Cross Country Championships", "response": ["|align=center|  10 || align=left | Birhan Dagne || align=left |  || 14:48", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Birhan Dagne || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 10"]}, {"page": "Blaydon Race", "response": ["| 1998 || Carl Thackery || Hallamshire Harriers || 27:25 || Birhan Dagne || Essex Ladies || 31:18", "| 1999 || Julius Kimtai || Kenya || 27:15 || Birhan Dagne || Essex Ladies || 31:04", "| 2000 || Julius Kimtai || Kenya || 26:35 || Birhan Dagne || Essex & Woodford || 31:18"]}, {"page": "Windsor Half Marathon", "response": ["|24 Sep 2006||25th||\t1:06:27 ||Tomas Abyu|| \t1:15:10 ||Birhan Dagne"]}, {"page": "Run to the Beat", "response": ["* 2008 Birhan Dagne, 1:18:22"]}, {"page": "Silverstone Half Marathon", "response": ["|2005|| 13 March ||Matt Smith || 1:05:23 || Birhan Dagne || 1:16:25", "|2004|| 7 March ||Matt Smith || 1:06:57 || Birhan Dagne || 1:15:54"]}, {"page": "1999 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships", "response": ["|align=center| 29 || Birhan Dagne ||  ||  1:13:41 || ", "|align=center| 8 ||  || Marian SuttonBirhan DagneJo Lodge ||  3:43:53"]}, {"page": "African U20 Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|Birhan Dagne"]}, {"page": "IAAF World Road Relay Championships", "response": ["|Askale BeredaDerartu TuluLeila AmanGadissie EdatoBirhan DagneAsha Gigi || 2:19:09"]}, {"page": "1994 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Junior women's race", "response": ["|align=center|  10 || align=left | Birhan Dagne || align=left |  || 14:48", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Birhan Dagne || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 10"]}, {"page": "1995 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Junior women's race", "response": ["|align=center|   5 || align=left | Birhan Dagne || align=left |  || 14:25", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| Birhan Dagne || align=right style=\"border:0\"| 5"]}, {"page": "1999 IAAF World Cross Country Championships \u2013 Senior women's race", "response": ["|align=center|  61 || align=left | Birhan Dagne || align=left |  || 30:55", "|align=left style=\"border:0\"| (Birhan Dagne) || align=right style=\"border:0\"| (61)"]}, {"page": "1999 European Athletics U23 Championships \u2013 Women's 10,000 metres", "response": ["| 9 || align=left | Birhan Dagne || align=left |  || 34:24.70 || "]}, {"page": "1994 World Junior Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's 3000 metres", "response": ["| 9 || align=left | Birhan Dagne || align=left |  || 9:20.51 || ", "| 3 || align=left | Birhan Dagne || align=left |  || 9:19.22 || Q"]}, {"page": "1994 World Junior Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's 10,000 metres", "response": ["| 5 || align=left | Birhan Dagne || align=left |  || 34:13.58 || "]}, {"page": "English National Cross Country Championships", "response": ["| 2004 || Leeds || Belgrave Harriers || Glynn Tromans (Coventry Godiva Harriers) || Bristol AC || Birhan Dagne (Belgrave Harriers)"]}, {"page": "City of Norwich Half Marathon", "response": ["|20 ||2004 ||1:09:20 ||Tesfaye Eticha || \t 1:19:14 || Birhan Dagne", "|22 ||2006 ||1:07:26 ||Simon Tonui || \t 1:17:18 || Birhan Dagne"]}, {"page": "Tracey Morris", "response": ["On 18 April 2004, she stood on the Blackheath, London starting line not knowing what was to come.
