However, hard-working spinster Nellie and her ne'er-do-well womanising brother Eli, rarely saw eye to eye. Nellie was played by comedian Hylda Baker, who was born and bred in Farnworth, eleven miles north of Manchester. Eli was played by Jimmy Jewel, a Yorkshire-born contemporary of Baker; he had made his name with Ben Warriss in the music hall (vaudeville) act Jewel and Warriss.", "Much of the comedy was derived from Nellie's constant malapropisms. When asked by Lily if she knew the facts of life, Nellie replied with immense dignity, \"Of course I do! I'm well over the age of content!\" In another episode, Nellie has a suitor named Vernon Smallpiece, whom she addresses as 'Vermin Bigpiece'. When Eli insists on playing the high-powered executive once he is in charge of the pickle business, Nellie asks him who he thinks he is \"sat sitting there like a big business typhoon!\" In each episode, Nellie and Eli would hurl insults at each other to spectacular effect, as they fought over the family business or domestic matters, with Nellie's constant nagging and Eli's constant drinking and womanising fuelling their arguments. It was known that the insults continued off-screen as well, as Baker and Jewel disliked each other in real life, their working relationship being described as \" the most toxic in the whole of British sitcom history\".McCann, Graham (9 August 2020) Comedy Chronicles:Strained Relationships: Hylda Baker & Jimmy Jewel Comedy.co.uk.

As originally conceived, \"Mistletoe and Wine\" had a different meaning from that for which it has come to be known. The writers wanted a song that sounded like a Christmas carol, intending it to be sung ironically while the little matchgirl is kicked out into the snow by the unfeeling middle classes.
