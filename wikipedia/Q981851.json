It is one of McCarthy's earliest works in which the influence of A. W. N. Pugin is apparent and the later florid French Gothic of his latter years (seen in St. Patrick's Dungannon and St Macartan's Cathedral in Monaghan) is nowhere to be seen. The church is constructed in the Early English style with a nave of 5 bays leading to a chancel arch and reduced chancel area beyond.  In 1980 during the re-ordering works carried out in the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council, the caen stone side altars, marble altar rails, carved pulpit, original high altar and Telford Pipe Organ were removed. Only the gargantuan Caen stone reredos survives (minus its central spire and High Altar) behind one of the reclaimed Caen stone and Carrera Marble altars, the front of which bears a carved representation of the Assumption of the Virgin (presumably formerly in the Lady Chapel which would have been to the right of this space). The crowning feature of the church today is the Western Window. This was designed and manufactured by Hardman of Birmingham (a firm employed and partly run by A. W. N. Pugin) and has representations of the Canonized Bishops and Abbots of the Archdiocese of Armagh around a representation of the Virgin crowned in glory and below a tripartite window representing the constituents of the Holy Trinity. The remaining stained glass is mainly by Mayer of Munich and dates to the end of the 19th century though there is a very fine Art Deco window showing the Annunciation in the style of Harry Clarke in the former Lady Chapel (now the baptismal font area). The Church underwent a multimillion-pound renovation in 2010-12 which included an extensive renovation and refit inside the Church, including restoring the marble floors, altar and upgrading electrical and sound systems, as well as major conservation and preservation work on the church exterior and windows."]}, {"page": "Davos", "response": ["* Harry Clarke (1889\u20131931 in Davos) an Irish stained-glass artist and book illustrator, TB patient from 1929, buried in Chur"]}, {"page": "Stained glass", "response": ["Among the most innovative English designers were the Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris (1834\u20131898) and Edward Burne-Jones (1833\u20131898), whose work heralds the influential Arts & Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.Peter Cormack, Arts & Crafts Stained Glass, Yale University Press, 2015 The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts & Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.", "Many 19th-century firms failed early in the 20th century as the Gothic movement was superseded by newer styles.
