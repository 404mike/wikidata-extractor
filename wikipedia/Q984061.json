While initial development only involved creating 3D models, executive producer Sam Houser said \"it really kicked off at the beginning of 2002\" and lasted about nine months. After the release of the Windows version of Grand Theft Auto III, the development team discussed creating a mission pack for the game that would add new weapons, vehicles, and missions. Upon further discussion, the team decided to make this concept a stand-alone game, which became Vice City. The game was announced on 22 May 2002, during the Electronic Entertainment Expo. It was Rockstar North's most expensive game at the time, with a budget of US$5 million. On 5 September 2002, the company announced that the release date of 22 October had been postponed until 29 October to meet product demand. By 15 October 2002, development of Vice City stopped as the game was submitted for manufacturing. Capcom published the game in Japan on 20 May 2004 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2. The game was added to the Rockstar Games Launcher in September 2019.", "The game is set in 1986 in fictional Vice City, which is based heavily on the city of Miami. Vice City previously appeared in the original Grand Theft Auto (1997); the development team decided to reuse the location and incorporate ideas from within the studio and the fanbase.

The team wanted to choose a location that had various similarities and differences to New York City\u2014the inspiration of Liberty City\u2014eventually leading them to Miami, which producer Leslie Benzies describes as \"a party town, all sun and sea and sex, but with that same dark edge underneath\". Sam Houser called it \"the grooviest era of crime because it didn't even feel like it was crime\u00a0... it was a totally topsy-turvy back-to-front period of time\". The team intended to make Vice City a \"living, breathing city\", for the player to feel like \"life still goes on\" while the character is inside a building.", "The team spent time \"solving [the] riddle\" of a speaking protagonist, a notable departure from Grand Theft Auto IIIs silent protagonist Claude. Ray Liotta portrayed protagonist Tommy Vercetti. Liotta described the role as challenging: \"You're creating a character that's not there before\u00a0... It's so intensive\". When recording the role, the team used blue screen in order to allow Liotta to visualise \"how it's gonna move\". The team ensured that the player felt \"real affinity\" for Tommy, making the narrative a key development interest. Dan Houser described Tommy as \"strong and dangerous and prepared to wait for the right opportunity to arrive\". Director Navid Khonsari recalled Liotta frequently complaining on set and found him difficult to work with as a result. \"In some sessions he was ... into it, but then sometimes ... he was very dark and couldn't work\", said Sam Houser. Following the game's success, Liotta reportedly complained that he was underpaid for the role.", "The game features 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue, four times the amount in Grand Theft Auto III. It contains over 90 minutes of cutscenes and nine hours of music, with more than 113 songs and commercials. The team was interested in the challenge of creating the game's soundtrack, particularly in contrast to Grand Theft Auto IIIs music, which Sam Houser described as \"clearly satirical and its own thing\". In developing the radio stations, the team wanted to reinforce the game's setting by collating a variety of songs from the 1980s and therefore performed extensive research. The radio stations were published by Epic Records in seven albums\u2014known collectively as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Official Soundtrack Box Set\u2014alongside the game in October 2002. Vice City contains about \"three times as much\" talk radio as Grand Theft Auto III.

The console's ability to use DVDs, an improvement over the PlayStation's limit to CDs, allowed the team to store more data, such as animations, music and environments. Despite this, the team found it difficult to fit the game into the PlayStation 2's 32 megabytes of RAM, due to the scale. The game's size also created difficulties for the testers, due to the variety of options.

Sam Houser cited films and shows like Heat (1995) and The Sopranos (1999\u20132007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game.

For the music, the team sought a broad diversity to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations, reflecting the gangster movie culture invoked by the game. The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city and provide a \"unique take on American life\"; Sam Houser described it as \"a very iconoclastic look at America\". The team used real DJs to portray those on the radio. In doing so, they wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs, seeking the effect of \"high production values and absurd content\".

Donovan invited Jones to Rockstar's offices in Manhattan, where he met the development team, including Dan and Sam Houser and producer Jamie King, and they invited him to work on the game. The writing sessions took place at Dan Houser's apartment, and the entire process, including editing and recording, took around four to five months. With the station's guests and callers, the writers wanted to satirise American lifestyles, focusing on fictional stories as opposed to quickly outdated stories based on recent news.

Dan Houser felt that the quality of the writing had to improve alongside the advancements in graphics and technology. He noted that the improvements in facial animation allowed for slower-paced cutscenes. The unique dialogue that plays when a mission is retried was to ensure that the gameplay felt \"less canned and less like Groundhog Day\".", "When Sam Houser first showed interest in using the Euphoria software in the game, he was told that it would be impossible or only limited to cutscenes, but some members of the team were able to make it work. Engineers from NaturalMotion worked on-site at Rockstar North for several months at a time to incorporate Euphoria software into the game. Rockstar also worked with Image Metrics for the game's facial animations. The facial rigs had around 100 joints, with a total of 300 minutes of facial animation. The scale of the project caused some issues for the animators, forcing them to have rigs completed before animation began. They also faced difficulty in the direction of the actor's head\u2014either straight on when looking at the teleprompter, or down when looking at a script. Image Metrics head of production David Barton noted that \"having realistic eyes is 90 percent of the battle\", as it allows the player to believe the character.
