His music is often described as progressive house, though he prefers to associate more with tech house and is sometimes described simply as \"deepsexyfuturistictechfunkouse\". At performances, he is well known to interact personally with the audience. Howells has mixed several albums for Global Underground in addition to his Nocturnal Frequencies series.  Howells is also a member of the duo Science Department with Dick Trevor, which has produced the singles \"Breathe\" and \"Persuasion\"/\"Repercussion\" as well as remixes for artists such as BT.

The first disc features a precise measured set that is as clean as the second disc is dark and moody. The discs contain a variety of strings with funked-up basslines creating a distinctly mellow feel. The cd can be easily compared to the style of Danny Howells, with a warm house feel and funky progressive sounds. The second is techier, more energetic and dance floor oriented, but definitely not trivial. The best tracks that confirm this are the fabulous remixes of \u2018I Need\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s Your Time\u2019, together with the last three numbers on the album. Disc two shows a darker view with more noise including artists like King Britt, DJ Yellow and D'Julz, as well as Radioslave, Aber, Shlomi and Jim Rivers. It also features Tomiie's Opus Ink co-production with Audiofly. The artwork on the front cover of the album shows a mysterious confusion and abstract nature of the music inside the cd. The disc has an energetic and dance floor oriented feel with tracks like \"I Need\" and \"It's Your Time\", including the closing tracks; Guy Gerber & Patrik K's \"Sleeping In The Bass Box\", Shlomi Aber which presents Bao with \"Crop Duster\" and Estroe's track \"Driven\"."]}, {"page": "List of Essential Mix episodes", "response": ["|Danny Howells", "| 18 February|| Danny Howells ", "| 30 May|| Danny Howells ", "| 28 July|| Danny Howells ", "| || Danny Howells "]}, {"page": "2010 Bonnaroo Music Festival", "response": ["**Danny Howells"]}, {"page": "We All Wanna Be Prince", "response": ["# \"We All Wanna Be Prince\" (Danny Howells Delirious Remix) - 7:32"]}, {"page": "Summadayze", "response": ["*Danny Howells"]}, {"page": "B 018", "response": ["The club is one of Beirut's most popular discoth\u00e8ques.
