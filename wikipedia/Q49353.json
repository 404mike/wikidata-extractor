A little over a year later he gained entrance to Imperial College, where he studied until the end of the war, coming top of his year in the final examination.

Prior to their discovery, 5-aminothiazoles were a relatively unknown class of compounds, but were of synthetic interest and utility. Their premier publication illustrated the formation of 5-amino-2-benzylthiazole and 5-amino-4-carbethoxy-2-benzylthiazole by reacting dithiophenylacetic acid with aminoacetonitrile and ethyl aminocyanoacetate, respectively. Subsequent experiments by Cook and Heilbron, detailed in their series of publications titled \u201cStudies in the Azole Series\u201d describe early attempts to expand the scope of 5-aminothiazole synthesis, as well as employ 5-aminothiazoles in the formation of purines and pyridines."]}, {"page": "Marc Julia", "response": ["Julia was born in 1922 in Paris as son of the renowned mathematician Gaston Julia.
