He had short loan spells at Shrewsbury Town and Morecambe in the 2006\u201307 season as a covering player, before he was signed by Shrewsbury Town permanently in July 2009. He was the club's regular custodian as promotion to League One was achieved in 2011\u201312. He joined Port Vale in July 2012, and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313. He joined Doncaster Rovers on loan in February 2016, and then Bury the following month. He joined Fleetwood Town on a free transfer in May 2016, before joining Salford City in May 2018.

However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons.

Highly rated striker Liam Dickinson, veteran forward Darren Byfield, and Irish attacker Tadhg Purcell also joined the club on trial. Adams appointed Doug Loft as club captain at the end of July.
