Bradley emigrated to America in 1831, and Branwell Bront\u00eb continued his studies under the portrait painter William Robinson. In 1834, he painted a portrait of his three sisters. He included his own image but became dissatisfied with it and painted it out. This portrait is now one of the best known images of the sisters and hangs in the National Portrait Gallery."]}, {"page": "John Bradley", "response": ["John Bradley may refer to:", "*John Bradley (American actor) (born 1960), American television actor", "*John Bradley (English actor) (born 1988), British actor from Game of Thrones", "*John Bradley (Australian footballer) (born 1943), Australian rules footballer for Footscray", "*John Bradley (drag racer) (1925\u20132012), American drag racer and land speed racer", "*John Bradley (RAF officer) (1888\u20131982)", "*John Bradley (United States Navy) (1923\u20131994), Navy Cross recipient, WW II", "*John Bradley (ironmaster) (1769\u20131816), English industrialist who set up the Stourbridge Ironworks", "*John Bradley (d. 1844) (1787\u20131844), British artist and drawing-master to the Bront\u00ebs", "*John Bradley (artist) (fl. 1830s-1840s), British-American artist", "*John Bradley (State Representative) (1817\u20131902), Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "*John Bradley (bishop), 16th-century English bishop", "*John Bradley (doctor) (1917\u20132004), Canadian doctor", "*John Bradley (historian), Irish historian", "*John Bradley & Co, proprietors of the Stourbridge ironworks"]}, {"page": "John Bradley (artist)", "response": ["right|thumb|Emma Homan by John Bradley, ca. 1844", "John Bradley was a British-born American artist who was active in the New York area in the 1830s and 1840s.
