Duncan later managed Queen's Park between November 1969 and May 1974.\nTommy Duncan's senior professional football career commenced as a 16 year old in the Scottish Highland Football League with his local senior football club, Buckie Thistle FC. His talents were spotted in the summer of 1952 when Airdrie FC played a two-game Highland pre-season tour, with one of the games played against Buckie Thistle at Victoria Park, Buckie, where Duncan shone on the Buckie Thistle left wing, and Airdrie subsequently, and quickly signed him, and where he spent the next eleven seasons at Airdrie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tommy Duncan", "response": ["Thomas Elmer Duncan (January 11, 1911 \u2013 July 25, 1967), better known as Tommy Duncan, was an American Western swing vocalist and songwriter who gained fame in the 1930s as a founding member of The Texas Playboys. He recorded and toured with bandleader Bob Wills on and off into the early 1960s.", "He organized another Western swing band called 'Tommy Duncan and His Western All Stars' featuring his younger brother Glynn (1921\u20132013), a Western swing pioneer, on bass (who would later become Wills' lead vocalist in the late 1950s). Another brother, Joe Duncan, was the lead vocalist for Johnnie Lee Wills' band for a period of time. At the height of the band's popularity, Duncan and the band made an appearance in the 1949 Western film, South of Death Valley, starring Charles Starrett and Smiley Burnette. Musical tastes were changing, however, and attendance at the Western All Stars' dances ranged from fair to poor, certainly not enough to sustain a large band, which lasted less than two years.", "As a member of The Texas Playboys, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an Early Influence in 1999, and was also inducted into the Texas Music Hall of Fame. Texas singer Billy Mata has released the Volumes I and II of a planned trilogy of tunes a tribute to Duncan entitled This Is Tommy Duncan. Glynn Duncan and his son Larry are among thousands of people who consider Duncan one of the most versatile vocalists of the 20th century.", "*The Handbook of Texas Online: Tommy Duncan"]}, {"page": "Thomas Duncan", "response": ["* Tommy Duncan (1911\u20131967), American musician", "* Tommy Duncan (footballer) (born 1936), Scottish footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Airdrieonians F.C.", "response": ["*Tommy Duncan"]}]}}
