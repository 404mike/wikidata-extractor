Duberry's batting and bowling styles are unknown. He was born on Montserrat.\nDuberry made his first-class debut for the Leeward Islands against Barbados in the 1966/67 Shell Shield at Warner Park, St Kitts. This appearance, which came in February 1967, made him the first Montserratian to play first-class cricket (one month before Vendol Moore's first-class debut). He made two further first-class appearances for the Leeward Islands, against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1968 at the Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's, and against the Windward Islands in 1973 at the Arnos Vale Ground, Kingstown. In his three first-class matches, he scored 26 runs at an average of 6.50, with a high score of 13 not out. With the ball, he took 2 wickets at a bowling average of 80.50, with best figures of 2/41.

However, he would not become the islands first first-class cricketer, as William Duberry had played for the Leeward Islands in February 1967. Montserrat took part in the Hesketh Bell Shield and its replacement tournament, the Heineken Challenge Trophy, throughout most of the 1970s and the 1980s. Their participation in the tournament continued into the 1990s, with matches home throughout this period being held at Sturge Park, which has also held first-class cricket on six occasions up to 1994. From 1995, Montserrat was devastated by eruptions from Soufri\u00e8re Hills. An eruption in 1997 destroyed Plymouth, with the resulting pyroclastic flows and ash fall from the eruption also destroying the main ground at Sturge Park, leaving the Montserratian team without first-class facilities."]}, {"page": "Duberry, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Duberry"]}]}}
