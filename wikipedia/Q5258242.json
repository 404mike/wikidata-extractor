Nine days later the tough striker endeared himself to \"Valiants\" fans when he scored a hat-trick past local rivals Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. He finished as top scorer in the 1978\u201379 season with 15 strikes in 48 games, and was voted Player of the Year for this achievement. Wright stated that he was always seen as a provider of goals at his previous clubs whereas Butler saw him as a goalscorer. However he lost his place under caretaker-manager Alan Bloor, though regained it with a brace against Northampton Town. He went on to record 9 goals in 33 games in 1979\u201380, but fell out with new manager John McGrath, and dropped out of the Football League at the end of the season, joining Kidderminster Harriers of the Southern Football League on a free transfer.

He replaced club legend Roy Sproson, and was given a large war chest to spend after a successful lottery scheme was set up at Vale Park. He took over with the club in 21st place in the Third Division. His first game in charge was a 0\u20130 draw with Midland Counties League side Arnold in the First Round of the FA Cup. In January, veteran defender Graham Hawkins was signed as a player-coach from Blackburn Rovers for \u00a36,000. Forward Neville Chamberlain also joined the club as a professional, becoming the club's first black pro. John Froggatt also joined the club, signing from Colchester United for \u00a310,000. Chairman Arthur McPherson celebrated this abandonment of frugality by declaring \"we are going places\". Local journalist Chris Harper slated the board for their decisions, calling them 'berserk'. Froggatt scored fifteen seconds into his debut in a 4\u20130 win over Exeter City. However this would be as good as it got for both Froggatt and Vale that season. In February, Vale beat Fort Lauderdale Strikers in a friendly, but also started a five games sequence without a win. Ged Stenson arrived the next month from Everton for a 'bargain' \u00a33,000, and John Lumsdon joined on loan from Stoke City. Vale improved, and were unbeaten in six of their seven March games, with Chamberlain scoring on his debut. Yet on 28 March they started a club-record streak of twelve home games without a win that would continue into the following season. Encouragement came from the youth side, who reached the Quarter Finals of the FA Youth Cup. With four games to go, Vale were one point clear of the drop, however by losing all of their remaining games the \"Valiants\" ended the 1977\u201378 season in 21st place and were relegated into the Fourth Division.

Losing five of their seven games in October, the \"Valiants\" drifted to third-from-bottom. Vale went undefeated in the league in November, but Bloor unexpectedly resigned in December 1979, saying he did not 'have what it takes'. Coach Gordon Banks was also dismissed, and he blamed the players for his downfall, claiming they did not like hard work.
