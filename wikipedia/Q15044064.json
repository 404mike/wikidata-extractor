It was disbanded in 1865.", "In 1847, Louisa Twining started to visit an old family nurse and from her she heard about the conditions inside of workhouses. In 1853, she made her first visit to a workhouse and found it to be overcrowded, and lacking food, sanitation and medical care. Afterwards, she approached the Strand Union Poor Law Board for permission to allow a group of ladies to visit one of its workhouses and they initially refused to give it. However, she argued that it was proper for women to look after the old, young and infirm. The Stand Union Poor Law Board and its guardians changed their decision and allowed the visit. In 1857, she started to publicise the poor conditions within workhouses. Additionally, she encouraged the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science to establish a visiting system to provide moral and spiritual comfort to the inmates, and to make the public aware of the poor conditions inside workhouses. One of the people she consulted was Catharine Tait who as the wife of the Dean of Carlisle had thrust herself into visiting her local workhouse.", "The problems that Louisa Twining faced were known to Catharine Tait and she formed a new and similar organisation exploiting the authority of her husband the Bishop of London and the select membership she produced by only inviting aristocratic or well connected women to join.
