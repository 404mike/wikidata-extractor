Livingstone accepted, and Labour Mayoral candidate Nicky Gavron volunteered to take a subordinate position as his deputy. In campaigning for the election, Livingstone highlighted his record: the congestion charge, free bus travel for under 11s, 1000 extra buses, and 5000 extra police officers, whereas his main competitor, the Conservative Steven Norris, campaigned primarily on a policy of abolishing the congestion charge. Livingstone continued to court controversy throughout the campaign; in June 2004 he was quoted on The Guardian's website as saying: \"I just long for the day I wake up and find that the Saudi Royal Family are swinging from lamp-posts and they've got a proper government that represents the people of Saudi Arabia\", for which he was widely criticised. That same month, he came under criticism from sectors of the left for urging RMT members to cross picket lines in a proposed Underground strike because the latest offer had been \"extremely generous\", leading RMT general secretary Bob Crow to step down as a TfL board member. In the 2004 London mayoral election, Livingstone was announced as the winner on 10 June 2004. He won 36% of first preference votes to Norris's 28% and Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes's 15%. When all the candidates except Livingstone and Norris were eliminated and the second preferences of those voters who had picked neither Livingstone nor Norris as their first choice were counted, Livingstone won with 55% to Norris's 45%."]}, {"page": "List of the first women holders of political offices in Europe", "response": ["*Deputy Mayor of London \u2013 Nicky Gavron \u2013 2000"]}, {"page": "The Earth Awards", "response": ["A prestigious and eclectic panel served on the Selection Committee, including: Paola Antonelli, Adam Bly, David Buckland, Antonio de la Rua, David de Rothschild, Nicky Gavron, Scott Hahn, Peter Head, Graham Hill, Dr. Dan Kammen, Yang Lan, Thom Mayne, Michael McDonough, Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, Barry Nalebuff, Sergio Palleroni, John Picard, Werner Sobek, Terry Tamminen, Suzanne Trocm\u00e9, Dilys Williams, and Dr. Kenneth Yeang.New York Social Diary"]}, {"page": "2012 London Assembly election", "response": ["|  || Labour Party || Nicky Gavron (101,245), Murad Qureshi (91,120), Fiona Twycross (82,837), Tom Copley (75,934) || Nicky Gavron, Murad Qureshi, Fiona Twycross, Tom Copley, Florence Nosegbe, Unmesh Desai, Kirsten Hearn, Liquat Ali, Mabel McKeown, Kevin McGrath, Christine Quigley"]}, {"page": "London Planning Advisory Committee", "response": ["The London Planning Advisory Committee (LPAC) was an ad hoc Londonwide joint committee responsible for strategic planning from the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986 to the creation of the Greater London Authority in 2000.
