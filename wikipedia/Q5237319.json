Walsall eventually equalised through an Alex Nicholls goal in the second half.

Deakin was introduced to the action during extra-time, coming on as an 108th minute substitute for David McDermott. The match eventually required a penalty shoot-out. The opening eight penalties were all successfully converted before the following four were all missed. The shootout ended when Deakin missed his side's eighth penalty, allowing Alan Tate to convert the winning penalty for Swansea."]}]}}
