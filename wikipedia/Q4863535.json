His promise went largely unfulfilled; his average of 25.34 in 147 first-class matches (the norm for a county cricketer of the period was around 30.00), scoring just one century. The highlight of his playing career was a man-of-the-match winning 76 in the 1969 Gillette Cup Final, a match in which he was not expected to play. Leadbeater broke a finger in the County Championship game the day before, and would have been omitted had Geoffrey Boycott not suffered a worse injury. Leadbeater said: \"I almost forgot about the fact that I had a broken finger. Then when it came to lunchtime, I was changing my clothing because of perspiration, and ate my lunch in a jockstrap and left batting glove! I couldn\u2019t get the glove off because my finger had swollen. I can't get m' breath!\" Leadbeater posted a top score of 90 in 106 one day games. Leadbeater was touted by Colin Cowdrey (amongst others) as a future Test match cricketer. However, batting lower down the order and a shin injury in 1970 meant that Leadbeater failed to score enough runs to impress the selectors.Leadbeater was to receive a benefit season from Yorkshire, but was released from the county the season before. This came as a surprise to Leadbeater, who had agreed to become the Second XI captain earlier in the season. This responsibility then went to Colin Johnson. Leadbeater was released from the county, finding out whilst in the local golf club.After being released from Yorkshire in 1983, Leadbeater immediately became a well-respected umpire on the first-class English circuit, umpiring four One Day Internationals during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Leadbeater was the third umpire in two Test matches, in 1993 and 2000. He umpired one further ODI \u2013 seventeen years later at Trent Bridge in 2000.\nHe retired from first-class umpiring at the mandatory age of 65 in September 2008, his final game being the match between his beloved Yorkshire and Somerset at North Marine Road, Scarborough. He received a guard of honour from the players (and his wife) at the start of the final day's play.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chris Balderstone", "response": ["Barrie Leadbeater, the umpires' chairman and a close friend, said: \"He was a fine, positive player who won a lot of friends by his approach.

There was a refreshing honesty about everything he did and he was a true sportsman of the like we don't see today.\""]}, {"page": "Leadbeater", "response": ["* Barrie Leadbeater (born 1943), English first-class cricketer and umpire"]}, {"page": "Huddersfield Cricket League", "response": ["* Barrie Leadbeater \u2013 Yorkshire (umpire)"]}, {"page": "Colin Johnson (cricketer)", "response": ["He was a stalwart for Yorkshire's Second XI, playing from 1966 to 1985, and captaining the side after he left the first-class scene.
