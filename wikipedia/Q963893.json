He was known for roles in British comedy television series such as Porridge, The Two Ronnies, and Open All Hours.\nBarker began acting in repertory theatre and decided he was best suited to comic roles. He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End including Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound. During this period, he was in the cast of BBC radio and television comedies such as The Navy Lark. He got his television break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966, where he met future collaborator, Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frost's production company and starred in ITV shows. \nAfter rejoining the BBC, Barker achieved significant success with the sketch show The Two Ronnies (1971\u201387), with Ronnie Corbett. The duo maintained their careers as solo performers; Barker notably starred as inmate Norman Stanley Fletcher in the sitcom Porridge (1974\u201377) and its sequel Going Straight (1978) and as shopkeeper Arkwright in Open All Hours (1976\u201385). He wrote comedy under his own name, though for much of his written material after 1968 he adopted pseudonyms (including \"Gerald Wiley\") to avoid pre-judgments of his writing talent. He won a BAFTA for best light entertainment performance four times, among other awards, and received an OBE in 1978.\nLater television sitcoms such as The Magnificent Evans and Clarence were less successful and he retired in December 1987. The following year, he opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1999, he appeared in smaller, non-comic roles in films. He died of heart failure on 3 October 2005, aged 76.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Ayckbourn", "response": ["His fortunes began to revive in 1963 with Mr. Whatnot, again premiering at the Victoria Theatre.

The British Film Institute commented, \"Its twinning of height and social position, combined with a minimal script, created a classic TV moment.\" This series was so popular that in 1966 Cleese and Chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with Brooke-Taylor and Feldman on At Last the 1948 Show, during which time the Four Yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writers/performers (the Four Yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a Monty Python sketch)."]}, {"page": "Michael Palin", "response": ["After finishing university in 1965 Palin became a presenter on a comedy pop show called Now! for the television contractor Television Wales and the West.
