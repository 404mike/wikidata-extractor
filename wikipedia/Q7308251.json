Ingle also played cricket for Cambridge University, but failed to win a blue. He was born at Bodmin, Cornwall and died at Bath, Somerset.\nA right-handed middle-order batsman, Ingle was a regular player for 10 years in the Somerset side from 1927 to 1937, an era in which the team's batting was dominated by amateur cricketers. A member of a legal family from Bath, Ingle himself practised as a solicitor in the city and for much of the 1930s, the Somerset side had three Bath solicitors in its ranks, with Bunty Longrigg, Ingle's successor as captain, appearing alongside Dickie Burrough.", "link_mentions": {}}}
