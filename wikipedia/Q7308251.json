Ingle also played cricket for Cambridge University, but failed to win a blue. He was born at Bodmin, Cornwall and died at Bath, Somerset.\nA right-handed middle-order batsman, Ingle was a regular player for 10 years in the Somerset side from 1927 to 1937, an era in which the team's batting was dominated by amateur cricketers. A member of a legal family from Bath, Ingle himself practised as a solicitor in the city and for much of the 1930s, the Somerset side had three Bath solicitors in its ranks, with Bunty Longrigg, Ingle's successor as captain, appearing alongside Dickie Burrough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset cricket captains", "response": ["Between 1894 and 1946, the club captaincy remained reasonably stable, six official captains spanned the 52-year period.  In addition to Woods, John Daniell, Jack White and Reggie Ingle all captained the side on more than 150 occasions, and Lionel Palairet led the team for one season and Massey Poyntz for two.  Bunty Longrigg was captain of the side either side of the Second World War, totalling 73 matches.  In contrast, the following nine years saw the club utilise eight different official captains, and a number more unofficial ones.  Jack Meyer, who went on to found Millfield, stood down at the end of 1947, his first season as captain.  In 1948, the club committee claimed that it was unable to find anyone of suitable pedigree to lead the side for the whole summer, and was forced to name three captains for the season.  Mandy Mitchell-Innes led the side throughout the pre-season and for the first five matches of the County Championship during leave from the Sudan Political Service. The captaincy then passed onto Jake Seamer, also on leave from the Sudan Political Service, for seven matches, before the committee settled on George Woodhouse, who remained in the position for the following 1949 season.Foot (1986), pp155\u2013156. The next three captains \u2013 Stuart Rogers, Ben Brocklehurst and Gerry Tordoff \u2013 all captained the side for three seasons or less, and in the words of cricket writer and Somerset County Cricket Club historian David Foot, \"captaincy had, ever since the war... been a matter of recurrent concern.\"Foot (1986), p169. This concern, and the fact that there was a lack of amateurs with the necessary time and money to dedicate to the role, meant that in 1956 the club appointed Maurice Tremlett to the role, the county's first professional captain."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Reggie Ingle (1923\u20131939) 309 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Jake Seamer", "response": ["During the summer between graduating from Marlborough College and going up to Oxford University, Seamer made his county cricket debut, playing three matches for Somerset County Cricket Club. In his first match for Somerset, played against Derbyshire, he played as a specialist batsman at number eight in the batting order. He came in to bat when Somerset had lost six wickets for the addition of 88 runs, and together with his captain, Reggie Ingle, helped Somerset to recover. The pair put on a partnership of 104 runs, and Seamer scored 70 runs in his debut innings. In both his other matches for the county that season, Seamer batted as part of the top order, and though he reached double figures in each of his innings, he did not achieve another half-century."]}, {"page": "Edmund Adams", "response": ["Adams batted in just one innings of the match against Essex at Clacton. He scored five coming in fifth in the batting order in the first innings, but when Somerset captain Reggie Ingle rejigged the order to make swift runs for a declaration in the second innings, Adams did not bat. Ingle's tactics were justified with a 150-run victory."]}, {"page": "Dickie Burrough", "response": ["Like his county captains Reggie Ingle and Bunty Longrigg, Burrough was a solicitor in Bath. He also played for Bath Cricket Club."]}, {"page": "Ulick Considine", "response": ["Considine's appearances became less frequent and after the mid-1920s he rarely played though his final match was not until 1935. He was a solicitor in Bath, like several other Somerset amateurs of the time, such as Reggie Ingle and Bunty Longrigg. In the Second World War he was a squadron leader in the Royal Air Force.Wisden 1951, p. 919."]}, {"page": "Bunty Longrigg", "response": ["In 1937, Longrigg played for Somerset more often, turning out in 11 matches and captaining the side on occasion in the absence of the regular captain, his fellow Bath solicitor Reggie Ingle. At the end of the season, amid some disgruntlement about the side's lack of drive under the amiable Ingle, Longrigg was appointed captain for the 1938 season. The move, Wisden reported in 1939, was a success: Somerset won 10 Championship matches for the first time ever and rose six places up the table to finish seventh. It wrote: \"Better team-work played an important part in Somerset's achievements, and in this connection they owed much to E. F. Longrigg... if he did not altogether fulfil expectations as a batsman, he certainly left no doubts concerning his qualifications for leadership. Those who closely followed the county's fortunes were impressed by his tact and judgment as well as keenness which often manifested itself.\" The personal highlight of the season was an unbeaten 187 against Gloucestershire at Bristol, and he added an unbroken 143 in 90 minutes for the eighth wicket with John Barnwell that was the Somerset record for the wicket until beaten by 172 by Viv Richards and Ian Botham in 1983."]}, {"page": "John Barnwell (cricketer)", "response": ["John Barnwell was a right-handed batsman who, in a team with a large number of all-rounders, frequently batted as low as No 8 or 9 in the order. He sometimes captained the team in the absence of the regular captains Reggie Ingle and Bunty Longrigg. He was also known as a good fielder in the covers."]}, {"page": "List of Old Oundelians", "response": ["*Reggie Ingle, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Michael Bennett (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1932, Bennett played in every Somerset match, making 544 runs at an average of 15.54. He scarcely bowled at all, with just 7.3 overs in the season, and at times in a fairly mobile batting line-up he came in as low as No 10 in the batting order. Nonetheless, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, summarising the Somerset season, noted that he \"accomplished enough as a batsman to keep his place in the side\". His one score of more than 50 in the season came in the final home match of the season at Taunton: he made 69 batting at No 8, but his innings was upstaged by centuries for Reggie Ingle and Dickie Burrough and a very fast 50 from Arthur Wellard."]}, {"page": "Ingle (name)", "response": ["*Reggie Ingle, English cricketer and lawyer"]}, {"page": "List of Cambridge University Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Reggie Ingle (1924\u20131926) : R.
