He was among the first in the academic law community to engage in human rights activism.Born and brought up in Newry, Boyle studied law at Queen's University Belfast. He was a lecturer in law at Queen's when he took part in the 1969 People's Democracy march from Belfast to Derry which was attacked by loyalists at Burntollet. He was later involved in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. Boyle's brother, Louis Boyle, also an alumnus of Queen's, was at the time active as a Catholic Unionist, and unsuccessfully sought to be the Unionist and Conservative candidate for South Down in the 1969 Stormont elections.\nIn the 1970s Boyle took up a post at University College, Galway (UCG, now the National University of Ireland, Galway). He became dean of the Faculty of Law in 1978, and in 1980 established the UCG human rights centre. In the 1980s he helped to develop the Essex Human Rights Law Centre, founded by Professor Malcolm Shaw, at the University of Essex in Colchester, England.Boyle was involved in several missions on behalf of Amnesty International in the 1980s. Later, he served as the first director of the human rights NGO Article 19 from 1986\u20131989. In 1990 he became director of the Human Rights Centre at Essex, holding that position until 2001.In 1998, Boyle was named Liberty's Lawyer of the Year, alongside Fran\u00e7oise Hampson, for their work advancing human rights claims before the European Court of Human Rights. He was based in Geneva from 2001\u20132002 as a special advisor to Mary Robinson during her time as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, returning to Essex University Human Rights Centre, where he again served as director in 2006\u201307.Boyle was called to the bar in Northern Ireland, in the Republic of Ireland, and in England and Wales.The archives of Kevin Boyle's work are housed at the James Hardiman Library at the National University of Ireland, Galway. These archives consist of over one hundred boxes of printed books and manuscripts and are a major resource for the teaching and study of human rights.A biography, Are you with me? Kevin Boyle and the rise of the human rights movement, by Mike Chinoy will be published in March 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boyle", "response": ["*Kevin Boyle (disambiguation), several people", "*Kevin Boyle (lawyer) (1943\u20132010), Northern Ireland-born human rights activist, barrister and educator", "*Kevin Boyle (historian) (born 1960), author and professor of history at Ohio State University"]}, {"page": "Religion in Norway", "response": ["In Norway as of 2019, 68.7% of the population are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church as compared to 96% in the 1960s.

These views have been challenged. Boyle and Hadden argue that the allegations do not stand up to serious scrutiny,Kevin Boyle and Tom Hadden, Northern Ireland: The Choice, Harmondsworth:UK, Penguin Books, 1994, p. 7. while nationalists object to the term on the grounds that it is not used by unionists to describe similar killings or expulsions of Catholics in areas where they form a minority.Bowden and Davis, p. 239 Henry Patterson, professor of politics at the University of Ulster, concludes that while the IRA's campaign was unavoidably sectarian, it did not amount to ethnic cleansing. Although the IRA did not specifically target these people because of their religious affiliation, more Protestants joined the security forces so many people from that community believed the attacks were sectarian. IRA volunteer Tommy McKearney argues that due to the British government's Ulsterisation policy increasing the role of the locally recruited RUC and UDR, the IRA had no choice but to target them because of their local knowledge, but acknowledges that Protestants viewed this as a sectarian attack on their community.  Gerry Adams, in a 1988 interview, claimed it was, \"vastly preferable\" to target the regular British Army as it \"removes the worst of the agony from Ireland\" and \"diffuses the sectarian aspects of the conflict because loyalists do not see it as an attack on their community\".Taylor, p. 337"]}, {"page": "Law of Northern Ireland", "response": ["*Law and State: The Case of Northern Ireland, Kevin Boyle, Tom Hadden and Paddy Hillyard, 1975"]}, {"page": "List of University of Essex people", "response": ["* Kevin Boyle - former Director, Human Rights Centre (3 terms)"]}, {"page": "New Ireland Forum", "response": ["In October 1984, in a Seanad debate on the Forum's report, Mary Robinson regretted that \"the range of contributors invited to make oral presentations to the Forum was too narrow\", and remarked that \"witnessing the Catholic Bishops and their representatives being questioned by politicians at the Forum may have marked a modest beginning to a healthy separation of Church and State in Ireland.\" She endorsed the view of political scientists Kevin Boyle and Tom Hadden, who stated:"]}, {"page": "Religion in Peru", "response": ["The Peruvian government is closely allied with the Catholic Church.

This applies to the country's 52 bishops, as well as to some priests whose ministries are located in towns and villages along the borders. In addition each diocese receives a monthly institutional subsidy from the Government. An agreement signed with the Vatican in 1980 grants the Catholic Church special status in Peru.Kevin Boyle and Juliet Sheen, Freedom of religion and belief: a world report. Routledge; 1997. Page 144.
