Charlotte had been created Baroness Newcomen in 1800 and Viscountess Newcomen in 1802, in honour of her husband as well as in recognition of the large estates she had inherited through her father. He was appointed High Sheriff of Longford for 1801.\nGleadowe-Newcomen succeeded his father as a Knight of the Shire for County Longford in 1802, a seat he held until 1806. He succeeded his father as second Baronet and his mother as second Viscount Newcomen in 1817. However, as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords.Lord Newcomen died in January 1825, aged 48, when all his titles became extinct. He inherited Newcomen Bank (now used as a Rates office on Lord Edward Street in Dublin, next to City Hall) but after a banking failure which ruined his own family and many clients in the 1820s he shot himself in his office.", "link_mentions": {}}}
