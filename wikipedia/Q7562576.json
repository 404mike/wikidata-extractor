He reported that cold reading can explain why so many pet psychics appear to communicate with animals. Pet psychics like Gerri Leigh and Animal Planet's Sonya Fitzpatrick work in front of audiences with the pets and owners present at the same time. Although appearing to be impressive, the conclusions and pronouncements are \"validated\" by the pet owners and not the pets themselves. Furthermore, linguistic professor Karen Stollznow tested a pet psychic with a cat named Jed. Not only was the psychic \"completely inaccurate in her reading of Jed's age, place of birth, background, behavior, health, and my health ...\", she was unable to tell that Jed was not her cat. Stollznow concluded that \"language is human-species specific. We don't and can't 'know' what animals think.\"Stollznow, K.
