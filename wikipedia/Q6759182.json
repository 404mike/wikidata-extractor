Baroque forms such as fugue, which might be called polyphonic, are usually described instead as contrapuntal. Also, as opposed to the species terminology of counterpoint, polyphony was generally either \"pitch-against-pitch\" / \"point-against-point\" or \"sustained-pitch\" in one part with melismas of varying lengths in another.Hendrik van der Werf (1997). \"Early Western polyphony\", Companion to Medieval & Renaissance Music.

Renaissance compositions were notated only in individual parts; scores were extremely rare, and barlines were not used. Note values were generally larger than are in use today; the primary unit of beat was the semibreve, or whole note. As had been the case since the Ars Nova (see Medieval music), there could be either two or three of these for each breve (a double-whole note), which may be looked on as equivalent to the modern \"measure,\" though it was itself a note value and a measure is not. The situation can be considered this way: it is the same as the rule by which in modern music a quarter-note may equal either two eighth-notes or three, which would be written as a \"triplet.\" By the same reckoning, there could be two or three of the next smallest note, the \"minim,\" (equivalent to the modern \"half note\") to each semibreve."]}, {"page": "All Souls College, Oxford", "response": ["* Margaret Bent"]}, {"page": "John Dunstaple", "response": ["The spelling \"Dunstaple\" is preferred by Margaret Bent, since it occurs in more than twice as many musical attributions as that of \"Dunstable\".

Brian Trowell has identified many of those named with royal households. There has been significant debate as to the dating of this motet. The earliest dating assumes that it was written for the 1349 founding of the Order of the Garter, this date suggested by Trowell. Roger Bowers suggests that the list of musicians includes musicians who were no longer active at the time of the writing. Margaret Bent and others argue for a later date because of the style of the music itself, which includes a complex structure with three levels of diminution and rhythmic overlapping. This later dating, however, does not fall in with the theory that the composer is the same as the chaplain Johannes Aleyn. A certain date earlier than 1370 for this work would lead to a change in accepted ideas about the mid-14th-century style."]}, {"page": "2008 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Dr Margaret Bent, Senior Research Fellow, All Souls College, Oxford.
