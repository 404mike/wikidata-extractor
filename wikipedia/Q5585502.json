During his time at 74th Brigade, relations with his staff had diminished to the point where they refused to take meals with him. He also believed in commandeering from other units and after leaving 25th Division, he repeatedly returned to poach staff officers and battalion commanders. The 74th Brigade would later provide the new divisional GSO.2, Walter Guinness (transferred after Bethell's intervention to the Chief of Staff at army headquarters) and the GSO.3, John Marriott (simply taken by Bethell from hospital). This approach extended to reorganising his new command. On 2 April, Bethell sent Gordon Macready, the divisional GSO.1, to acquire several hundred guns in order to reform the 66th Division as a machine-gun division, an idea that appears to have been entirely Bethell's own. After raiding other divisions and emptying the Machine Gun Corps training school, Bethell reported to Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front that the division was ready to return to combat; he was surprised to find that his friend \"Duggie\" disapproved of these methods, rejected the proposal and informed him that his division would instead be withdrawn and used as a training unit. Bethell was later offered a new division but chose to remain in the 66th Division, hoping that it would return to the front lines at a later date."]}, {"page": "Gordon Nevil Macready", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gordon Macready"]}, {"page": "Index of Sri Lanka\u2013related articles (G)", "response": ["# Gordon Macready"]}]}}
