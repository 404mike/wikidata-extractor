However, the show did feature a new comedy character, Ugly Yeti. The first two episodes did not have Basil live in the studio as he was ill in hospital.  The amount of live swaps was reduced from 10 to 5 and popular sketch Zeroes did not return. Celebrity guests included Tom Daley. Team Sam & Lewis were proven to be the best when they made it to the final in Series 2. The credits for the show list Ugly Yeti as being played by Marcus Garvey. This was rumoured to be a reference to Rastafarian leader Marcus Garvey, since some early reggae is played as background music on the show. The \"question line\" and \"gungeulator\" segments no longer featured. The \"Gunge Gallery\" along with a tweaked \"dunk beds\" featured instead. The \"Gunge Gallery\" is five gunge tanks in a row in which children (members of a karate club, football team etc.)would be sat and one child would be chosen to be gunged after each successful swap. Each Child would be gunged by the end of the programme."]}]}}
