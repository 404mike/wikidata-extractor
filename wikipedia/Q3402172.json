Gwynn Jones. Peate received an M.A. in 1924 for a dissertation on the anthropology, dialect and folklore of the people living in the Dyfi valley. While studying at Aberystwyth, Peate won university prizes for his poetry and for his participation in the eisteddfod.Peate began his career by lecturing in rural Ceredigion and Meirioneth, before being appointed in 1927 to catalogue the National Museum of Wales' folk collections.Inspired by the open-air museums of Scandinavia, Peate had a vision of recreating this style of attraction for Welsh life and culture. His initial attempts were challenged by those outside and inside the academic world. The work on the museum commenced in 1946, thanks to the donation of land from the Earl of Plymouth.\nPeate published work on the study of folk life in both English and Welsh. He was a pacifist who registered as a conscientious objector in 1941 and believed in a monoglot Welsh-speaking Wales.Peate was a judge for the National Eisteddfod for a number of years.Peate received a number of honours over his life. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by both the National University of Ireland and the University of Wales. He declined a 1963 New Years honour appointment as an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE).Peate and his wife Nansi are buried in the Unitarian chapel on the grounds of St Fagans National History Museum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rhiwbina", "response": ["Rhiwbina has been the home of many notable figures in Welsh-language culture, including W.

Most structures re-erected in Skansen were built of wood and are thus easily taken apart and reassembled, but a comparable museum in Wales was going to be more ambitious, as much of the vernacular architecture of Wales is made of masonry."]}, {"page": "Cyril Fox", "response": ["On the way to his appointment as Director of the National Museum of Wales in 1926, he was a clerk in a government commission on tuberculosis and then director of a small research station in Cambridge. He moved to work part-time for the university's museum of archaeology and anthropology, and he completed a Ph.D thesis, entitled Archaeology of the Cambridge Region. This work was published under the same title in 1923, and met with immediate success, with his election to a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in the same year. In 1922 he was appointed curator of archaeology in the National Museum of Wales, and in 1926 became its Director. He produced a remarkable range of publications. They include The Personality of Britain (1932), drawing attention to the differences between upland and lowland Britain; Offa's Dyke (1955), a seminal study of that great earthwork, and studies on Celtic Art, on the major discovery of early ironwork at Llyn Cerrig Bach in Anglesey; and Monmouthshire Houses, co-authored with Lord Raglan. For his administrative and scholarly work he gained a wide range of honours, including a knighthood (1935) and Fellowship of the British Academy (1940). Fox's breadth of vision means that his work is still valuable today. Together with his colleague Nash-Williams at the Museum of Wales, he collaborated with the artist Alan Sorrell on reconstruction drawings of the Roman excavations at Caerwent which were published in the Illustrated London News 1937\u20131942. Among other achievements, he encouraged his colleague Iorwerth Peate in the development of what became in 1946, under Peate's direction, the Welsh Folk Museum at St Fagan, near Cardiff (now titled the St Fagans National History Museum).Y Bywgraffiadur Cymreig 1951\u20131970 (London 1997)National Welsh Biography (1951\u20131971)"]}, {"page": "Mari Lwyd", "response": ["Once inside, the entertainment continued with the Mari Lwyd running around neighing and snapping its jaws, creating havoc, frightening children (and perhaps even adults) while the Leader pretended to try to restrain it.

The folklorist Iorwerth Peate believed that in recorded examples from Glamorgan it was apparent that the Mari Lwyd custom had become \"indistinguishable\" from the practice of wassailing, although added that there were still some examples of wassailing that did not involve the Mari Lwyd. He added that links between Mari Lwyd and wassailing were also apparent from recorded examples in other part of Wales, thus opining that Mari Lwyd represented a variant of the wider wassailing custom that was found throughout Britain."]}, {"page": "Llanbrynmair", "response": ["* Iorwerth Peate (1901\u20131982) founder, National Folk Museum of Wales, St. Fagan's"]}, {"page": "1982 in Wales", "response": ["*19 October \u2013 Iorwerth Peate, founder of St Fagans National History Museum, 81"]}, {"page": "1948 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** The National Museum of Wales opens the Welsh Folk Museum at St Fagans to the public, the first open-air museum in the UK (director: Iorwerth Peate)."]}, {"page": "1948 in Wales", "response": ["*1 July - The National Museum of Wales opens the Welsh Folk Museum at St Fagans to the public, the first open-air museum in the UK (director: Iorwerth Peate)."]}, {"page": "Literature Wales", "response": ["The Academi was initially formed as a Welsh language society in 1959, following a public discussion between Robert Maynard Jones and the poet Waldo Williams.

This was the description of a house where both people and beasts were housed together under the same roof, as portrayed in the Medieval Welsh poem the Dream of Rhonabwy. Peate thought that the Welsh Longhouse had had a long history and that it occurred in all parts of Wales. This view was challenged by Peter Smith, who had gathered a vast amount of information in his Houses of the Welsh Countryside, published in 1975. This showed that longhouses were rarely one-phase buildings and often the byre had been added onto the house. This showed that longhouses were not an upland phenomenon and are noticeably absent from Gwynedd where Snowdonia Houses are detached from their farm buildings. The longhouses occur particularly in Ceredigion, Radnorshire and North Powys. Suggett uses the example of Nannerth-ganol near Rhayader to illustrate the close connection of with the family who lived in this house with cattle rustling, which was particularly prevalent in mid-Wales in the Elizabethan period.\"Suggett and Stevenson\" (2010), 83\u201392"]}, {"page": "Rhiwbina Garden Village", "response": ["Blue plaques erected by the Rhiwbina Civic Society in Rhiwbina Garden Village commemorate the residences of the founder of the St Fagans National Museum of History, Iorwerth Peate, in Lon-y-Dail, writer and Welsh nationalist Kate Roberts in Lon Isa, archaeologist Cyril Fox in Heol Wen, and social reformer Edgar Leyshon Chappell in Y Groes.", "thumb|right|A blue plaque for Iorwerth Peate on Lon-y-Dail in Rhiwbina Garden Village"]}]}}
