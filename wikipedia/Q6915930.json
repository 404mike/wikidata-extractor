Although losing 2\u20131 to Scotland in the opening game, a goalless draw with England and a 2\u20131 victory over Ireland did secure the side the runners-up spot. With club sides in Wales attracting record crowds, the national team often found itself losing out to the domestic game in terms of spectators. The victory over Ireland came on the same day Cardiff City hosted South Shields in the Football League Second Division; only 11,000 attended the national side's match in Swansea while more than 30,000 attended Cardiff's fixture. Disappointing results between 1922 and 1923 prompted a revamp of the team for the 1923\u201324 British Home Championship. One of the debutants in the team was Swansea Town's Willie Davies who scored in a 2\u20130 victory over Scotland in the opening game. Davies added a further goal again in Wales' second match, a 2\u20131 victory over England with Ted Vizard scoring the winning goal. A final win over Ireland, via a Moses Russell penalty, secured the title for Wales having beaten all three sides in the same tournament for the first time. The success was partly attributed to the team's star players being released to play, but the change was short-lived. Six players withdrew from the squad for the opening match of the 1924\u201325 tournament, a 3\u20131 defeat to Scotland. Wales' success did prompt England to agree to a Saturday fixture in Wales for the first time; Fred Keenor scored for Wales but the side fell to a 2\u20131 defeat. Only a goalless draw with Ireland stopped Wales finishing last, a year after winning the tournament.", "Squad withdrawals continued to be a problem for the Welsh side. When Wales were left short for the visit of Scotland in the 1925\u201326 Championship, Ted Robbins called up debutant Jack Lewis after following him to a train station in Newport where he was due to travel to Birmingham to play for Cardiff City. Defeats to Scotland and Ireland followed and Robbins was again forced to make a late addition for the final match against England: John Pullen had been travelling to London with Moses Russell and was persuaded to join up to win his first cap, alongside Charlie Jones. Wales went on to win the match 3\u20131. Wales recorded a third championship win of the decade during the 1927\u201328 tournament, despite starting the competition poorly: they conceded two goals in the first half against Scotland before Ernie Curtis and an own goal by Jimmy Gibson salvaged a point. Wales defeated England 2\u20131 before travelling to Belfast to play Ireland in the final match. The game was tied at 1\u20131 until Wilf Lewis secured the win for Wales by charging both the ball and opposition goalkeeper into the net. When Ireland defeated Scotland two weeks later, Wales were officially confirmed as winners."]}]}}
