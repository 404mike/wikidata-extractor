The match ended as a 1\u20131 draw after referee Stuart Attwell disallowed two Derby goals in the final few minutes. Atwell also booked eight players and issued a straight red card to Forest midfielder Lewis McGugan. Jewell was especially vocal in his dismay at Attwell's performance, accusing the 25-year-old official of 'losing control' of the game and 'robbing' the Rams of a victory. The press furore around his display saw Attwell called in for a meeting with Referee's Chief Keith Hackett and was consequently axed from the following week's fixture list. Days after the game Derby manager Paul Jewell said that a member of the Football Association had contacted him and told him that the second goal should have stood. The Attwell controversy overshadowed Derby's run of only one defeat in 11 and their retention of the Brian Clough Trophy. It also stretched Derby's unbeaten streak against Forest to five, having lost just once to their rivals in the last 11 meetings. Following the Forest game however, Derby's form began to stutter \u2013 despite two wins over League One clubs Brighton & Hove Albion (4\u20131) and Leeds United (2\u20131) in the League Cup, taking Derby to their first quarter-final in the competition since 1989, Derby won just one of their next four league games, a 3\u20130 win over Sheffield Wednesday that gave them their biggest league win since a 5\u20131 win over Colchester United in May 2007. The club's dip in form saw Jewell making vocal his desire to bring fresh legs and impetus into a squad being hit by injuries and a busy fixture list, whilst assistant manager Chris Hutchings called for greater 'consistency'. Despite the club's disappointing form they remained in contention for the play-offs. The last week of November proved to be a busy one as the club signed former Southampton defender Darren Powell on a free transfer and brought in West Ham United youngster James Tomkins and Charlton Athletic's Luke Varney in on loan, with Andy Todd, Liam Dickinson, Jay McEveley and Mitchell Hanson\"Hanson heads to Notts\", dcfc.co.uk, 27 November 2008. going out on loan to Northampton, Blackpool, Charlton and Notts County respectively.", "Clough's first game in charge was due to be Cardiff City away in the Championship, but it was called off due to a frozen pitch.
