It was put on sale by his son, Simon Howard, to meet the costs of a divorce and to help with the running costs of the Castle Howard estate.  Howard offered to sell the work to the Tate Gallery, but its suggested price of \u00a35.5 million was rejected.  Auctioned at Sotheby's in September 2001, the painting was bought by London art dealer Guy Morrison. The Antiques Trade Gazette suggested that Morrison had been subject to \"Auction fever\", i.e. getting carried away and bidding more than his private client had authorised him to. The hammer price of \u00a39.4 million (sometimes quoted as \u00a310.3 million) was a record for a work by Reynolds and then the second highest amount paid for a painting by a British artist (the record was \u00a310.7 million, paid for John Constable's The Lock in 1990, a level now substantially passed by another sale of The Lock in 2012 and by several sales of work by Francis Bacon, including his Triptych, 1976 in 2008 and his Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 2013)."]}]}}
