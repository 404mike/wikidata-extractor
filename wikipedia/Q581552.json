His Edinburgh practice became one of the most successful medical practices in Scotland. The Chambers Biographical Dictionary says of him that after James Gregory's death, he was \"recognized as the first consulting physician in Scotland\". As surgeon to  The Royal Public Dispensary and the New Town Dispensary he provided free medical care for the poor of the town and taught medical students and apprentices. He published extensively on medical topics and latterly on metaphysics morality and religion. A devout Christian he gave financial support to missionary work. Abercrombie was awarded the honorary degree of MD from the University of Oxford, was elected Rector of Marischal College and University, Aberdeen and appointed Physician to the King in Scotland.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* John Abercrombie (1780\u20131844)"]}, {"page": "November 14", "response": ["*1844 \u2013 John Abercrombie, Scottish physician and philosopher (b. 1780)"]}, {"page": "October 10", "response": ["*1780 \u2013 John Abercrombie, Scottish physician and philosopher (d. 1844)"]}, {"page": "List of pathologists", "response": ["* John Abercrombie, Scottish physician, neuropathologist and philosopher."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* John Abercrombie (physician)"]}, {"page": "List of eponymous diseases", "response": ["* Abercrombie disease (a.k.a.

An account of the appearances observed in the dissection of two of three individuals presumed to have perished in the storm of the 3rd, and whose bodies were discovered in the vicinity of Leith on the morning of the 4th, November 1821 : with some reflections on the pathology of the brain. Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh 1824;1:82\u2013169 He was asked by local magistrates to try to establish the cause of death. Kellie noted that the veins in the meninges and surface of the brain were congested and the associated arteries were relatively bloodless while the brain was otherwise normal. In concluding that the individuals died from exposure he quotes a similar case described by Samuel Quelmalz (1696\u20131758) where exposure results in a progression through weariness, lassitude, drowsiness, coma and death which he ascribes to disordered cerebral circulation. He concluded 'When the cavity of the cranium is encroached upon by depression of its walls compensation may be made at the expense of circulatory fluid within the head; less blood is admitted and circulated'. Kellie gave credit to two of his Edinburgh contemporaries for their contributions in the shaping of this concept, Alexander Monro secundus (' \u2026 my illustrious preceptor in anatomy, the second Monro') and John Abercrombie. Monro had stated that since the healthy cranial cavity is rigid and of constant volume and the brain 'is nearly incompressible, the quantity of blood within the head must remain the same'.Monro A. Observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system: illustrated with tables. Edinburgh: Printed for, and sold by, William Creech 1783 Later in the paper Kellie described how Monro, aware of his interest, invited him jointly to examine the brains of executed criminals and sent him descriptions of autopsy findings in other similar cases. He gives Abercrombie particular credit when he writes  'the argument has already been taken up and illustrated by Dr Abercrombie, in his ingenious analysis of apoplexy \u2026 '. In 1818 Abercrombie indeed had \u2018proposed a doctrine\u2019 clearly setting out the hypothesis.", "Kellie went on to achieve local distinction in his lifetime.

Examination showed a small palpable tumour on the occipital region. Over the next few months the symptoms worsened and the tumour grew in size. After consulting his physician colleague Dr John Abercrombie, who worked alongside him at the Royal Public dispensary, he dissected the tumour and established that it arose from the dura mater and was therefore not amenable to excision. The patient died two weeks later. At post mortem there were multiple small tumours arising from the dura mater and also from the cranial nerves.
