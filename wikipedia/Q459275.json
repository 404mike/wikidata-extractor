It became his lasting epitaph, but there is no contemporary evidence to prove that she coined the famous phrase at the time. She wrote him a fan letter; his response was to visit her because of her high social status, and then to pursue her passionately."]}, {"page": "List of years in literature", "response": ["*1806 in literature \u2013 Zofloya by Charlotte Dacre - Leonora by Maria Edgeworth - The Wild Irish Girl by Sydney, Lady Morgan"]}, {"page": "1827 in literature", "response": ["*Sydney, Lady Morgan \u2013 The O'Briens and The O'Flaherties"]}, {"page": "Salvator Rosa", "response": ["A passage in one of his satires suggests that he sympathized with the 1647 insurrection led by Masaniello\u2014whose portrait he painted, though probably not from life.

County against county, but more frequently Bally against Bally came forth in mutual and picturesque defiance. The first ladies of the neighbourhood frequently presided as umpires; whilst the combatants, whose chief claims were their personal prowess, enlisted in their ranks young men of the first families, as well as the prime youth and manhood of the \"mere Irishry\". Early in the last century, a celebrated hurling match took place in Connaught, sustained by the gentry, farmers and squirearchy of the neighbouring counties of Sligo and Roscommon. All the chief gentry of the neighbourhood were present, the flower of Irish youth of both sexes. It was the custom to award to the victor of the field a ribbon to wear at his breast, or some other simple mark of distinction, presented by the Queen of Beauty of the day. On this occasion, the Queen of Beauty was Sydney, the orphan grand-daughter of Sir Malby Crofton; the victor of the day was Walter MacOwen, Anglice Owenson, a gentleman according to the genealogy of Connaught, but a farmer by actual position. He was very handsome in person and tall in stature, and of noted prowess in all contests like the present."]}, {"page": "1781 in poetry", "response": ["* December 25? \u2013 Sydney, Lady Morgan, n\u00e9e Owenson (died 1859), Irish novelist and poet"]}, {"page": "1827 in Ireland", "response": ["*Sydney, Lady Morgan, publishes her romantic novel with political overtones, The O'Briens and the O'Flahertys, in London."]}, {"page": "1814 in Ireland", "response": ["*Sydney, Lady Morgan, publishes her novel O'Donnell."]}, {"page": "Robert Owenson", "response": ["Robert Owenson (Robert MacOwen) (1744\u20131812) was an Irish actor, author and father of Lady Olivia Clark and novelist Sydney, Lady Morgan.", "Owenson's elder daughter, the novelist Sydney, Lady Morgan wrote of his theatre: \"The National Theatre Music Hall\": \u2018The first performance [of the National Theatre at Fishamble St.] was to be altogether national, that is, Irish, and very Irish it was.

He devoted his musical talent and business energy to the theatre.  When his wife died Fisher sold his share in the theatre, and made a professional tour on the continent, visiting France, Germany, and Russia, and reaching Vienna in 1784.  The Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t employed three languages in a memorandum\u2014\"Monsieur Fischer, ein Engell\u00e4nder und virtuoso di Violino\"\u2014which probably refers to the stranger's performance at a concert of the society.  Fisher won favour also at court, and became as widely known for his eccentricities as for his ingenious performances.  It was not long before he drew odium upon himself through his marriage with, and subsequent ill-treatment of, Anna Storace, the prima donna.  The wedding had taken place with a certain amount of \u00e9clat, but when the virtuoso bullied and even struck his bride, the scandal soon became public, and a separation followed.  Fischer visited Mozart that week  who supported Fischer\u2019s case.  The emperor (Joseph) ordered Fisher to quit his dominion.  Leaving his young wife he sought refuge in Ireland.  The cordiality with which his old friend Robert Owenson welcomed him to Dublin, his personal appearance, and introduction into the family circle, have been amusingly described by Sydney, Lady Morgan, one of Owenson's daughters.  Fisher gave concerts at the Rotunda, and occupied himself as a teacher.
