He was an enthusiastic balloonist and he was also particularly active in meteorology. He performed many meteorological and aviation experiments, designing and building his own equipment. He travelled widely, visiting Australia in his youth and later making many visits to USA \u2013 crossing the Atlantic at least 50 times \u2013 he travelled widely in Europe and visited Mexico, Russia, Siberia and Africa in pursuit of his interests.\nPatrick Alexander was respected by fellow aeronautical pioneers and knew Octave Chanute, the Wright brothers, Alberto Santos-Dumont, Lawrence Hargrave, Louis Bl\u00e9riot, Henry Farman, Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Charles Rolls of Rolls-Royce and Major Baden Baden-Powell, as well as European heads of state and royalty. Patrick, a world traveller, arranged meetings between those interested in aeronautics, and gave lectures on the progress being made.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Erith", "response": ["*Patrick Young Alexander (1867\u20131943), aeronautical pioneer, born in Erith or Belvedere."]}, {"page": "List of sailors", "response": ["*Patrick Young Alexander, British aeronautical pioneer"]}, {"page": "Imperial Service College", "response": ["*Patrick Young Alexander"]}, {"page": "Aldershot", "response": ["The observatory is a circular red-brick building with a domed roof and it stands on Queen's Avenue.

Through donations from Society members (Rudolph Hertzog, Werner von Siemens, Otto Lilienthal), the tethered balloon Meteor was purchased. The Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences made a one-time grant of 2000 Marks. Several private citizens (Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld, Kurt Killisch-Horn (1856\u20131915), Patrick Young Alexander) put their private balloons at the disposal of the project. Nonetheless, the Society was not in a position to raise the funds to build and maintain a suitable balloon. Subsequently, a \"Committee for the Organization of Scientific Flights\" was set up in mid-1892, composed of Richard A\u00dfmann, Wilhelm von Bezold, Hermann von Helmholtz, Werner von Siemens, Wilhelm Foerster, August Kundt and Paul G\u00fc\u00dffeldt. The committee made an appeal to Kaiser Wilhelm II, which was supported by the Academy of Sciences.R. A\u00dfmann: Die Entwickelung der neueren wissenschaftlichen Luftfahrten. The Kaiser granted the request of 50 thousand Marks for the building and operation of the balloon Humboldt from his \"Allerh\u00f6chsten Dispositionsfonds\". After the crash-landing of the Humboldt, he granted a further 32 thousand Marks for the building of the Ph\u00f6nix. To finance additional flights, and for the publication of the scientific results, a renewed application was made in 1895, for which 20,400 Marks were paid. In 1897, the publisher Georg B\u00fcxenstein donated a thousand Marks for the building of the recording balloon Cirrus\u00a0II.", "Other participants were the professional pilots Richard Opitz (1855\u20131892) and Stanley Spencer, the British aviation pioneer Patrick Young Alexander, and a series of military balloonists such as Major Stephan von Nieber (1855\u20131920), the commander of the Luftschifferabteilung, and Richard von Kehler.", "After the success of the Berlin scientific balloon flights became generally known, the British aviation pioneer and promoter Patrick Young Alexander came to Berlin to participate in the flights with his ballon Majestic. Among other flights, he participated in the flight on 4 December 1894 from Berlin. Berson started alone on this day with the Ph\u00f6nix from Leopoldshall (near Sta\u00dffurt), partly because there was a convenient supply of hydrogen there, and also because the greater distance to the sea allowed a longer flight with a southerly wind direction. To allow them to reach the highest possible altitude, the basket was stripped of anything that was not strictly necessary, such as the anchor that weighed 40\u00a0kg. As the towline was difficult for a single person to handle, it was, contrary to the usual practice, already rolled up before the flight. The balloon, filled with 2,000 m\u00b3 of hydrogen, rapidly ascended, and reached 5,000 m within one hour. After two hours, and frequent use of supplemental oxygen by the pilots, the balloon reached equilibrium at 9,155 m altitude, with a temperature of \u221247.9\u00a0\u00b0C. As the ballast had been consumed to the point of the emergency reserves, Berson had to descend despite still being in a good physical state. He had reached an altitude higher than any human before him. After a total of five hours' flight, the Ph\u00f6nix landed in the vicinity of Kiel.A. Berson, R.
