Under the tenure of the fourth president of Austin College, Reverend Samuel Magoffin Luckett, Austin College suffered several yellow fever epidemics and complications related to the Civil War. Texas Synod of the Presbyterian Church decided the college would be relocated to Sherman in 1876. Construction of the new campus in north Texas came in the form of \"Old Main,\" a two-story, red brick structure, which occurred between 1876 and 1878. Struggling with the Long Depression, Austin College saw little improvement to its building or grounds during the late 1870s; as such, Samuel Luckett resigned his position as president. From 1878 to 1885, the college continued to struggle from the aftershocks of economic depression; with an increasing debt and shrinking student body, the college turned to its 7th president, Reverend Donald MacGregor. A shrewd and well connected businessman, President MacGregor relieved a great deal of the college's debt and returned operations to normalcy. After MacGregor's death in 1887, the college welcomed President Luckett back to the campus. Throughout his second term as president, Samuel Luckett adopted a military program, grew the student body, introduced a YMCA chapter, established intercollegiate athletics and Greek fraternities, and added two wings to Old Main."]}, {"page": "Samuel (name)", "response": ["*Samuel McKinney (1807\u20131879), Irish-born Presbyterian minister in the American South"]}, {"page": "McKinney (surname)", "response": ["*Samuel McKinney (1807\u20131879), Irish-born Presbyterian minister in the American South"]}, {"page": "Chalmers Institute", "response": ["In 1847, Reverend Samuel McKinney, an Irish-born Presbyterian minister, opened the Chalmers Institute, a boys' school.
