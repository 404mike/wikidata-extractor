The principles of a real Whig, in my sense of the term, are these, That government is an original compact between the governors and governed, instituted for the good of the whole community; that in a limited monarchy, or more properly regal commonwealth, the majesty is in the people, and tho'the person on the throne in superior to any individual, he is the servant of the nation;- that the only title to the crown is the election of the people; that the laws are equally obligatory to the Prince and people; that as the constitution of England is formed of three legislation branches, the balance between each must be preserved, to prevent the destruction of the whole; that elections ought to be free, the elected independent;- that a Parliamentary influence by places and pensions is inconsistent with the interest of the public; and that a Minister who endeavours to govern by corruption, is guilty of the vilest attempt to subvert the constitution;- that a standing mercenary army, in time of peace, is contrary to the laws, dangerous to the liberties, and oppressive to the subjects of Great Britain.James Dallaway, Letters of the Late Thomas Rundle, L.L.D., Lord Bishop of Derry in Ireland, to Mrs. Barbara Sandys, of Miserden, Glocestershire: With Introductory Memoirs by James Dallaway, pp.241-3, Byrne & Moore, (1789)"]}, {"page": "William Worcester", "response": ["Worcester made several journeys through England, and his notes (now known as his \"Itineraries\") contain much information.

The English clergyman John Covel visited Iznik in 1677 and found that only a third of the town was occupied. In 1745 the English traveller Richard Pococke reported that Iznik was no more than a village. A succession of visitors described the town in unflattering terms. After his visit in 1779, the Italian archaeologist Domenico Sestini wrote that Iznik was nothing but an abandoned town with no life, no noise and no movement. In 1797 James Dallaway described Iznik as \"a wretched village of long lanes and mud walls...\". The town was seriously damaged in 1921 during the Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922); the population became refugees and many historical buildings were damaged or destroyed."]}, {"page": "Ralph Bigland", "response": ["Much of Bigland's antiquarian work was focused on Gloucestershire.

A number of instalments of the Historical, Monumental, and Genealogical Collections relative to the County of Gloucester were published between 1786 and 1794 (completing two volumes, dated 1791 and 1794), and further instalments appeared sporadically through the 19th century.
