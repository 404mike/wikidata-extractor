These snipers he stalked and killed. Later his patrol was similarly held up, and again he disposed of the snipers. When during the subsequent withdrawal of the patrol it was observed that a party of the enemy were endeavouring to outflank them, Pte. Barratt at once volunteered to cover the retirement, and this he succeeded in accomplishing. His accurate shooting caused many casualties to the enemy, and prevented their advance. Throughout the enterprise he was under heavy machine gun and rifle fire, and his splendid example of coolness and daring was beyond all praise. After safely regaining our lines, this very gallant soldier was killed by a shell.\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the Staffordshire Regiment Museum, Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Staffordshire, England.\nHe was commemorated in Tipton by a block of flats being named Barratt Court. When these flats were renovated the plaque erected in his memory went missing. A replacement plaque was unveiled at a ceremony in May 2012.", "link_mentions": {}}}
