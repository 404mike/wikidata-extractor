Later in life, he changed his surname to Burleigh and became a celebrated war correspondent for London's The Daily Telegraph.Born in Glasgow, he began work as a shipping clerk at the age of 20. Shortly afterwards, he was forced to marry one of the family's servants after getting her pregnant. Burley left for North America with another clerk to take part in the American Civil War. He joined the Confederates, disrupting Union ship traffic. Burley was captured in May 1864 but escaped a month later. He took part in a raid on Lake Erie in September 1864 led by John Yates Beall. Burley had convinced a Canadian cousin in Guelph, Adam Robertson, to manufacture munitions for use in that raid. He returned to Guelph but was later captured and extradited to the United States. The jury deadlocked at his first trial and he was returned to jail to await a second trial. Burley was able to escape to Canada and returned to Scotland. At this point, he changed his name to Bennet Burleigh.\n\nIn 1881, Burleigh was hired by the London Telegraph to cover the war in Sudan. He was a correspondent for the Central News Agency during the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. Burleigh was the first to report the failure of the Gordon relief expedition, which led to the slaughter of the Khartoum garrison. He also covered the Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War. He authored several books on his experiences reporting on conflict.Burleigh ran unsuccessfully several times for Glasgow seats in the British parliament.He died in Bexhill on June 17, 1914 and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery.\nBurleigh is thought by some to be a model for the correspondent Gilbert Torpenhow in Rudyard Kipling's The Light that Failed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Omdurman", "response": ["Controversy over the killing of the wounded after the battle began soon afterwards. The debate was ignited by a highly critical article published by Ernest Bennett (present at the battle as a journalist) in the Contemporary Review, which evoked a fierce riposte and defence of Kitchener by Bennet Burleigh (another journalist also present at the battle). Winston Churchill privately agreed with Bennett that Kitchener was too brutal in his killing of the wounded. This opinion was reflected in his own account of the battle when it was first published in 1899. However, mindful of the effect that patriotic public opinion could have on his political career, Churchill significantly moderated criticism of Kitchener in his book's second edition in 1902. The Khalifa, Abdullah al-Taashi, escaped and survived until 1899, when he was killed in the Battle of Umm Diwaykarat. Several days after the battle, Kitchener was sent to Fashoda, due to the developing Fashoda Incident. Kitchener was ennobled as a baron, Kitchener of Khartoum, for his victory.

His superb horsemanship, expert bush skills and educated manner soon attracted the attention of his superiors. South Australian Colonel Joseph Gordon recommended him as a dispatch rider to Bennet Burleigh, the war correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph; the job reportedly provided Morant with ample opportunity to visit the nearby hospital and pursue dalliances with the nurses.", "During March 1900, Sergeant Morant carried dispatches for the Flying Column to Prieska, commanded by Colonel Lowe, 7th D.G., who was in the general advance to Bloemfontein and participated with the engagements of Karee Siding and Kroonstadt, and other engagements with Lord Roberts until the entry into Pretoria.  Morant was at the Battle of Diamond Hill and was then part of General French's staff, Cavalry Brigade, as war correspondent with Bennet Burleigh of the London Daily Telegraph.  He accompanied that unit through Middelburg and Belfast to the occupation of Barberton.  At this point, he took leave and returned to England for six months."]}, {"page": "War correspondent", "response": ["* Bennet Burleigh (1840\u20131914), Sudan (Omdurman), Boer War, Russo-Japanese War, Italo-Turkish war"]}, {"page": "Burleigh", "response": ["*Bennet Burleigh, British journalist "]}, {"page": "BL 5-inch howitzer", "response": ["*Bennet Burleigh, Khartoum Campaign, 1898 Describes 5-inch howitzer use in the campaign"]}, {"page": "Military attach\u00e9s and observers in the Russo-Japanese War", "response": ["* Bennet Burleigh, Daily Telegraph (London)."]}, {"page": "List of journalists killed during the Mahdist War", "response": ["Metammeh: A battle at Metammeh occurred after the British had established a base at Korti and after the Battle of Abu Klea.
