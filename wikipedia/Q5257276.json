During this period, he served as the party's International Secretary, and represented the SDLP on the Executives of the Party of European Socialists and the Socialist International.  At the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election, Haughey was elected to represent Mid Ulster, but with other SDLP candidates did not take his seat, and instead joined the New Ireland Forum.  He stood unsuccessfully for the Westminster seat of Mid Ulster at every general election from 1983 until 1997.In 1989, Haughey was elected to Cookstown District Council, later becoming the leader of the SDLP group on the council.  He led the SDLP team in the Brooke-Mayhew Talks and later the talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement. In 1996 he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Northern Ireland Forum election in Mid-Ulster. At the 1998 Assembly election, he was again elected for Mid Ulster.

Opposition to the Sunningdale Agreement led to an alliance of unionist parties under the label of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition running agreed candidates in all constituencies, here putting forward the new leader of the Ulster Unionists, Harry West. Although unionist supporters of Sunningdale ran Hubert Brown, West garnered 26,858 votes (43.8%) to Brown's 3,157 (5.1%). The nationalist vote was evenly split with McManus gaining 16,229 votes (26.3%) and Denis Haughey, standing for the new Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), winning 15,410 votes (25.0%). Many believed that an agreed single nationalist candidate could have won the seat. When a second general election was held in October Frank Maguire stood as an Independent Republican with backing from all nationalists, while West was the sole unionist. Maguire gained 32,795 votes (51.8%) to West's 30,285 (47.9%) and 185 (0.3%) for Alan Evans, standing for the Communist Party of Ireland."]}, {"page": "New Ireland Forum", "response": ["| Denis Haughey"]}, {"page": "Haughey", "response": ["* Denis Haughey, Former Minister and MEP"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 1st Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Denis Haughey", "|Denis Haughey"]}, {"page": "Members of the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Denis Haughey", "|Denis Haughey"]}, {"page": "Mid Ulster (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| Denis Haughey(SDLP)", "| Denis Haughey(SDLP)", "| align=\"right\" |Patsy McGloneDenis HaugheyKathleen LaganPat McErleanJoe McBride"]}, {"page": "Sean Farren", "response": ["He has authored, co-authored or edited four books: The Politics of Irish Education (1995), SDLP \u2013 the Struggle for Agreement in Northern Ireland (2010), with Robert Mulvihill, Paths to a Settlement in Northern Ireland (2000), and with Denis Haughey, John Hume: Irish Peacemaker (2015).
