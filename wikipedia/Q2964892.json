McHugh had awarded New Zealand a penalty try, after a high tackle on Tana Umaga, and denied South Africa's Breyton Paulse a try after an interference call against James Dalton. These incidents allegedly incited Pieter Van Zyl, a South African supporter, to invade the pitch and tackle and assault McHugh. Van Zyl evaded over four hundred security officials to launch the assault as New Zealand's Justin Marshall was preparing to put the ball into a scrum. New Zealand's Richie McCaw punched Van Zyl and, together with South Africa's AJ Venter, wrestled the assailant off McHugh. Van Zyl was then escorted off the pitch by two security officials. The assault left McHugh with a dislocated shoulder and he had to be replaced as the match referee by Chris White. Van Zyl was subsequently found guilty of assaulting McHugh and fined R10,000 (\u20ac1,012). He also received a lifelong ban, preventing him from attending matches organised by the South African Rugby Union."]}, {"page": "2003 Rugby World Cup", "response": ["*  Chris White"]}, {"page": "Chris White (referee)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris White (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "European Rugby Champions Cup", "response": ["| Chris White (England)  Tony Spreadbury (England) ", "| Chris White (England)", "| Chris White (England)"]}]}}
