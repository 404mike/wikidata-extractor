Shooting on the real rooftops turned out to be less expensive than building them at Pinewood. The next four weeks were scheduled for filming the car chase at Lake Garda and Carrara. On 14 April, a closing scene featuring Jesper Christensen's Mr. White and Paul Ritter's Guy Haines getting killed by Bond after Bond said his iconic \"Bond, James Bond\" line was reportedly filmed, but the filmmakers removed it during post-production in case they decided to bring back Mr. White and/or continue the Quantum story arc in future sequels. The scene's deletion later enabled Mr. White's return in Spectre. On 19 April, an Aston Martin employee driving a DBS to the set crashed into the lake. He survived, and was fined \u00a3400 for reckless driving. Another accident occurred on 21 April, and two days later, two stuntmen were seriously injured, with one, Greek stuntman Aris Comninos, having to be put in intensive care. Filming of the scenes was temporarily halted so that Italian police could investigate the causes of the accidents. Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell said the accidents were a testament to the realism of the action. Rumours of a \"curse\" spread among tabloid media, something which deeply offended Craig, who disliked that they compared Comninos's accident to something like his minor finger injury later on the shoot (also part of the \"curse\"). Comninos recovered safely from his injury."]}, {"page": "Ritter (surname)", "response": ["* Paul Ritter (architect) (1925\u20132010), Australian architect, artist and author", "* Paul Ritter (painter) (1829\u20131907), German architectural painter and etcher", "* Paul Ritter (diplomat) (1865\u20131921), Swiss ambassador to the United States"]}, {"page": "Really Old, Like Forty Five", "response": ["*Monroe - Paul Ritter"]}, {"page": "Tom Rosenthal (actor)", "response": ["In 2011, Rosenthal was cast as Jonny Goodman in the Channel 4 sitcom Friday Night Dinner, along with Simon Bird, Tamsin Greig, Paul Ritter, and Mark Heap.
