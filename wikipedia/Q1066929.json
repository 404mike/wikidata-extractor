Robert Cawkwell of Sheffield was responsible for the interior designs when, in 1935, Nicholson, a Sheffield stockbroker, opened the hall as a country club, investing \u00a380,000 in its art deco renovation. The interior was dramatically modernised and featured a mirror-walled ballroom and an elaborate and versatile state-of-the-art lighting system. There was also a heated outdoor swimming pool, and membership fees ranged from three to seven guineas. Nicholson built an airfield in the grounds, enlisting the help of the pilot Captain Tom Campbell Black, who with C. W. A. Scott had won the air race from Mildenhall to Melbourne in 1935. Black was a well-connected socialite, and it was through him that the then Prince of Wales learned of the club, flying there in his private Dragon aircraft, which bore the royal insignia. The aviator Amy Johnson also patronised the club. Other facilities included an 18-hole golf course, the design of which Nicholson entrusted to the celebrity golfer John S.F. Morrison, championship-standard squash courts, and tennis courts. The  swimming pool was built by the Sheffield-based construction company B. Powell and Son. Such was the club's reputation, that the BBC transmitted its weekly Saturday show \"Late Night Dance Music\" with Henry Hall, Carroll Gibbons and Charlie Kunz from Firbeck."]}, {"page": "Kunze", "response": ["*Charlie Kunz (1896\u20131958), American pianist"]}, {"page": "List of Decca Records artists", "response": ["* Charlie Kunz"]}, {"page": "Middleton-on-Sea", "response": ["*Pianist Charlie Kunz (died 1958),"]}, {"page": "Yours (Qui\u00e9reme Mucho)", "response": ["*Charlie Kunz"]}, {"page": "British dance band", "response": ["* Charlie Kunz"]}, {"page": "Streatham Park Cemetery", "response": ["*Charlie Kunz "]}, {"page": "Roberto Parra Sandoval", "response": ["In improvised presentations in all kinds of nightclubs, he conceived a style that would become known under the name of \"jazz guachaca\", a style that takes inspiration from people such as the American pianist Charlie Kunz, the trombonist and arranger  Tommy Dorsey and the gypsy-Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt.
