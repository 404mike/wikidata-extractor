He won his second Australasian Championships in 1909, with his remorseless drives proving too much for Ernie Parker to handle in the final.   The same year he qualified as a Barrister and Solicitor at the Supreme Court of New Zealand. Focusing on his tennis game, he won the Wimbledon singles title for four straight years between 1910 and 1913. He was the last player to win four successive championships until 1979; when Bjorn Borg won his fourth successive championship. He attained the first of three No. 1 rankings in 1911. In 1910 and 1912 he defeated Arthur Gore in the final, both times in four sets. In 1911 his opponent Herbert Roper Barrett retired in the final at two sets all. In 1913 at Wimbledon tennis player and author A. Wallis Myers says that he played \"the best game of his life\", beating American Maurice McLoughlin, the 1912 U.S. National Championships winner, in three straight sets. In 1914 he narrowly missed winning his fifth title in a row, losing in the final to Norman Brookes. In addition, he won four men's doubles titles at Wimbledon, in 1907 and 1914 with Norman Brookes and in 1908 and 1910 partnering with Major Ritchie.", "| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1911 || Wimbledon || Grass ||  Herbert Roper Barrett || 6\u20134, 4\u20136, 2\u20136, 6\u20132 ret."]}, {"page": "Tennis at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Herbert Roper Barrett  Arthur Gore"]}, {"page": "Norman Brookes", "response": ["| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || || 1914 || Wimbledon || Grass ||  Anthony Wilding ||  Herbert Roper Barrett Charles Dixon || 6\u20131, 6\u20131, 5\u20137, 8\u20136 "]}]}}
