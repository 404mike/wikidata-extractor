During the sixteenth century at least 70 people were implicated in the Witch Trials, and the events inspired works such as Burns' \"Tam o' Shanter\" and \"The Thirteenth Member\" by Mollie Hunter. One of the most famous witch trials at North Berwick was that of Agnes Sampson. She was accused of making a potion to create rough storms in the North Sea as King James VI of Scotland was sailing home from Denmark with his new wife, Anne of Denmark. The trial took place in 1591, attended by King James.
