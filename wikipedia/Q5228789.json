A prolific practitioner, he was a master of the pun and double entendre.During the small screen's Golden Age, he wrote scripts for comedians including Benny Hill, Tony Hancock, Ted Ray, Terry Scott, Spike Milligan, Eric Sykes, Peter Sellers, Charlie Drake, Arthur Askey, Sid James, Leslie Crowther, Roy Hudd, Jimmy Edwards, Tommy Cooper, Harry Worth and Frankie Howerd.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dead Parrot sketch", "response": ["In 1963, Benny Hill performed a sketch entitled \"The Taxidermist\" (written by Dave Freeman) on The Benny Hill Show in which he attempted to pass off a stuffed duck as a parrot (blaming its different appearance on \"the steaming\" and \"the shrinkage\").

Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included Patricia Hayes, Jeremy Hawk, Peter Vernon, Ronnie Brody and his co-writer from the early 1950s to early 1960s, Dave Freeman. Short, bald Jackie Wright was a frequent supporting player who in many sketches had to put up with Hill slapping him on the top of his head."]}, {"page": "Ted Ray (comedian)", "response": ["* Dave Freeman \u2013 Additional Material (3 shows)"]}, {"page": "Terry Nation", "response": ["*5 episodes (co-written with Dave Freeman, John Junkin and Spike Milligan, 1956)"]}, {"page": "Carry On Behind", "response": ["*Screenplay \u2013 Dave Freeman"]}, {"page": "1922 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 22 August \u2013 Dave Freeman, scriptwriter (Benny Hill, Carry On films, etc.) (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "Bless This House (British TV series)", "response": ["Bless This House is a British sitcom that aired on ITV from 2 February 1971 to 22 April 1976.
