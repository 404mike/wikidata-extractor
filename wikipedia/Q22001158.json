Originally intended to bring together Catholic women in England,   the organization has grown, and may be found in numerous Commonwealth countries. It is especially flourishing in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. Membership consists mainly of women who are members of the Roman Catholic Church, and who work together to promote Catholic values and to carry out volunteer and charitable work.", "In 1906, Margaret Fletcher, an English convert to Catholicism, suggested the founding of a Catholic women's organization in England. She was supported in this idea by a small group of women, who formed the core of the organization at its beginning.  The first official gathering of the Catholic Women's League was in 1907. By the 1920s, the CWL had approximately 22,000 members, many of whom were well educated, middle class women.

The organization's first meeting was in November 1912, and as a result a job placement service was set up and Rosary Hall was opened, to provide safe and affordable accommodation."]}, {"page": "Fletcher, Margaret", "response": ["#Redirect Margaret Fletcher"]}]}}
