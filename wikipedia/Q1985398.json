Things are repeatedly explained, unnecessarily.\" Still, Poole also said, \"Such defects wouldn't be so annoying were it not obvious that Nick Harkaway can sometimes be a very good writer indeed. Readers who are prepared to mentally edit the book as they go along, as the author and editor have not, will encounter a host of highly enjoyable fragments and suggestive ideas.\" Then again, the same paper also picked the novel as one of its best books of the year, with Adam Roberts describing it as \"an amazing and quite unforgettable piece of fiction.\""]}, {"page": "Aidan Truhen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nick Harkaway"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Cornwell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nick Harkaway"]}]}}
