He was entered by the team to drive a BRM 15, equipped with the V16 engine, in the 1951 Italian Grand Prix. He qualified the car 10th, but was not allowed to start the race when it emerged that he did not possess the correct racing licence due to his lack of experience. He did not make another attempt at entering a World Championship Formula One race.\nHe did, however, continue to race in both sportscars and endurance events.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "TVR", "response": ["In January 1962, the company hired Ken Richardson as a competition manager, with the intent that he would lead TVR's attempts to enter international racing.

The lightweight cars were prepared by chief mechanic David Hives and competition mechanic Bob Hallett, although only one of them would actually finish the race (the other two retiring early with mechanical failure.) TVR directors began to doubt the new leadership when they saw Bryan Hopton's tendency to overextend the company's finances in motor racing, as well as on indulgences such as luxury transport and hotels.
