He followed his father, and an older half-brother, into the navy and was promoted to commander early in the French Revolutionary Wars while serving in the West Indies with Sir John Jervis. His first command was a fireship, though he was also temporary commander of a 74-gun warship, before being promoted to post captain and given a frigate. He was successful in cruising against privateers, and was given another ship, in which in late 1799, he was involved in the chase of two Spanish frigates, capturing one of them. They were found to be transporting valuable cargoes from the Spanish colonies, and their capture made the captains involved extremely wealthy men, with their crews also receiving huge sums of money comparative to their usual wages.\nYoung commanded a frigate in the Mediterranean for the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars, paying her off at the peace. He did not immediately return to service with the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, and it was not until 1807 that he commissioned a 74-gun ship and joined the expedition to Copenhagen. Promoted to flag rank towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Young was further advanced to vice-admiral in 1830, and died three years later with the rank of vice-admiral of the white.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Young", "response": ["James Young may refer to:", "*James Young (physician) (1929\u20132008), American White House physician", "*James Young (chemist) (1811\u20131883), Scottish chemist; distilled paraffin from coal", "*James Young (Canadian politician) (1835\u20131913), member of the Canadian House of Commons", "*James Young (congressman) (1866\u20131942), U.S. Representative from Texas", "*James Young (mayor) (born 1955), first African American to be elected mayor of Philadelphia, Mississippi, 2009", "*James Young (New Brunswick politician) (1841\u20131907), merchant and political figure in New Brunswick, Canada", "*James Young (Upper Canada politician) (1777\u20131831), political figure in Upper Canada", "*James Young (trade unionist) (1887\u20131975), Scottish politician and trade unionist", "*James Young (Missouri politician) (1800\u20131878), Lieutenant Governor of Missouri who also served in the Tennessee House of Representatives", "*James Young (American football) (born 1950), former professional American football defensive end", "*James Young (basketball) (born 1995), American basketball player", "*James Young (cricketer) (1913\u20131994), South African cricketer", "*James Young (footballer, born 1882) (1882\u20131922), Scottish footballer, played for Celtic F.C. and Scotland", "*James Young (footballer, born 1891) (1891\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "*James Young (hurler), hurling player from County Laois, Ireland", "*James Young (American musician) (born 1949), guitarist for the band Styx", "*James Young (British musician) (born 1952), author and musical collaborator with Nico", "*James Young (comedian) (1918\u20131974), Northern Irish comedian", "**James Young (album), a comedy album by James Young ", "*James Young (director) (1872\u20131948), American film director and actor", "*James Hardy Vaux (1782\u2013?), wrote the first Australian dictionary and used James Young as an alias", "*James Young (Royal Navy officer, born 1717) (1717\u20131789), Royal Navy officer", "*James Young (Royal Navy officer, born 1762) (1762\u20131833), Royal Navy officer", "*James Young (British Army officer) (1858\u20131926), British general", "*James Young (Arizona pioneer) (1844\u20131935), African-American boxer and Arizona pioneer", "*James Young (coachbuilder), a coachbuilder for carriages or automobiles"]}, {"page": "James Young (1762-1833)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Young (Royal Navy officer, born 1762)"]}, {"page": "James Young (1762\u20131833)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Young (Royal Navy officer, born 1762)"]}]}}
