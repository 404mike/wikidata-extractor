But then I met him, got to know him, [and] got to hear about his fabulous ideas.\" Bj\u00f6rk and Hooper's recording ideas were similar, which led to her decision to end production with Massey and Fox. Hooper introduced Bj\u00f6rk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries, who gave Debut a modern style with keyboards and synthesizers. He produced the first ten tracks on the album, while Bj\u00f6rk co-produced \"Like Someone in Love\" with Hooper and produced \"The Anchor Song\" alone.

He employed the services of Howie B, DJ Premier, and producer Marius de Vries (Bj\u00f6rk, Massive Attack). Through the songs on the album, he takes a close look at native traditions like Peyote Healing. The album's opening track, \"The Sound Is Fading\", samples a recording of a young Native American singer from the 1940s that Robertson got from the Library Of Congress, and the song \"Sacrifice\" includes parts of an interview from prison with Leonard Peltier set to a soundscape produced by Robertson and de Vries. The racial epithet in the album's title comes from an experience Robertson had where some bullies referred to him as \"Red Boy\" while he was playing with his cousins.

In September, the band moved the recording sessions to Hanover Quay in Dublin to a studio the band had just converted from a warehouse.McCormick (2006), p. 265. The studio was designed to be more of a rehearsal space more than an actual studio. Flood, Howie B, Steve Osborne, and Marius de Vries joined Hooper and the band there, each of them incorporating their influences and experiences in electronic dance music. Flood described Howie's influence thus: \"Howie would be playing all kinds of records to inspire the band and for them to improvise to. That could be anything from a jazz trumpet solo to a super groove funk thing, with no holds barred. We also programmed drum loops, or took things from sample CDs; anything to get the ball rolling.

Marius de Vries told Sound on Sound that the project was driven by an \"overriding aesthetic of being homely and comfortable\", which had \"all to do with Bj\u00f6rk wanting to make a record as a reaction to the wanderings and the pain she experienced making Dancer in the Dark, and how much that had taken out of her, to make a record about the place you come back to after you've wandered.\" She began to use her laptop to write music, and Vespertine has been retrospectively referred to as \"her laptop album\". For the string and music box arrangements, she used Sibelius scorewriter software. In Iceland, programmers Jake Davies and Marius de Vries joined Bj\u00f6rk for a writing session, laying down more tracks, in addition to nine already mixed. Then, she \"set up camp [...] during summer\" in a New York City loft, and began to work with harpist Zeena Parkins. Much of Vespertine was \"composed, crafted and edited\" in that loft, in what has been called the \"Domestika sessions\". Some tracks were recorded as an overdub \"on top of a slave mixdown\" of the Spanish sessions. As she wanted to write her own songs on music boxes, Bj\u00f6rk contacted a music box company requesting transparent acrylic boxes because she wanted the sound to be \"as hard as possible, like it was frozen\". Bj\u00f6rk decided to use instruments whose sound would not be compromised when downloaded from sites such as Napster. She explained:", "In Homogenic, every track was built around a loud beat, but in Vespertine Bj\u00f6rk wanted to make a \"microcosmos of thirty or forty beats interacting\".Gestsd\u00f3ttir, R. (Director). (2003). Minuscule [Documentary]. One Little Indian To do this, she recorded noises around her house to make beats out of them. Once the songs were almost finished, Bj\u00f6rk contacted the duo Matmos, who she considered \"virtuosos\" in the field, and sent them various songs to work with. They added beats made from the noise of crushing ice and shuffling cards, among others. In her documentary  Minuscule, Bj\u00f6rk explained that this process consisted of \"taking something very tiny and magnifying it up to big\", intending to convey the \"sensation that you've been told a secret\", that is also present in micrographs. Marius de Vries and Bj\u00f6rk did a lot of the sound design in Vespertine with a text-based synthesizer called Supercollider. Although he described it as \"horrendous and impenetrable once you first get it\", de Vries admitted: \"There is something about typing commands in and hearing the noises come out which is very different from tweaking knobs and it really does take you in surprising directions. It's a way of disrupting the normal circuitry between you and the sound-making machinery.\"", "* Marius de Vries \u2013 additional programming , beat programming ", "Category:Albums produced by Marius de Vries"]}, {"page": "Homogenic", "response": ["* Marius de Vries \u2013 programming"]}, {"page": "Post (Bj\u00f6rk album)", "response": ["* Marius de Vries \u2013 keyboards, programming"]}, {"page": "Want One", "response": ["Want One is the third studio album by the Canadian-American singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, released through DreamWorks Records on September 23, 2003.

AllMusic's Zac Johnson described the album as \"another set of obscenely lush and opulent pop operettas... meticulously layered and richly textured, with full orchestral passages and many-throated harmonies\". After praising the album, Johnson concluded that Wainwright \"could be singing lists of names out of the phone book and it would still be more exciting and inventive than 99 percent of the other albums out there\".

Starting with the release of White Ladder, Gray began to make significant use of computer-generated music to accompany his voice and acoustic instrumentation. A New Day at Midnight continued this direction, although lyrically it was darker in tone than White Ladder and the instrumentation much more downbeat. In the liner notes, Gray dedicated the album to his father, who died in 2001. Despite the move to more complex music, Gray has used small-scale, often home-based, recording methods and equipment and espoused a do-it-yourself approach to music production.
