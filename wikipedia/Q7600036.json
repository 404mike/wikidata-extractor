As a boy he took an interest in animals, collecting water beetles and maintaining them in aquariums and was a member of the local natural history society. He studied at St Paul's School and later went to Trinity College in Dublin from where he graduated with a gold medal in 1903. He studied botany under H. H. Dixon.\nIn 1910 he joined the Zoological and Anthropological section of the Indian Museum and when the organization was converted in 1916 to the Zoological Survey of India, he became Superintendent and took up the study of crustaceans to continue work started by James Wood-Mason and Alfred William Alcock. He spent fourteen years in India during which he published seventeen papers on the decapods in the Indian Museum. In 1918 he made a trip to Baluchistan along with Thomas Nelson Annandale. Other expeditions were made to the Andaman Islands, the Abor Hills, the Garo Hills and Rameshwaram. In 1913 he married Agnes Green, daughter of Reverend William Spotswood Green who was the first to climb Mount Cook in New Zealand. In 1910 he became a Fellow of Calcutta University and a Fellow of the Asiatic Society. In 1924 he returned to Ireland to become the first director of research in the Discovery Investigations.He was Director of the Marine Biological Association from 1936 to 1945.\nAmong the discoveries he made were the first onychophoran from the Indian region which he named as Typhloperipatus williamsoni.He died in Plymouth, Devon in 1945. The National Marine Biological Library at the Marine Biological Association hold some of his scientific and personal papers in the MBA Archive Collection.\nFrogs Philautus kempii and Bufoides kempi are named after him; Philautus kempiae is named after his wife. In 2018, researchers from the Zoological Survey of India have named a new species of crab, Teretamon kempi, discovered from Namdapha, Arunachal Pradesh after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "RRS Discovery", "response": ["Stanley Wells Kemp was appointed the project's director of research while Joseph Stenhouse, veteran of the drift of the Aurora, was made captain of Discovery.

Stanley Wells Kemp, then an assistant superintendent at the Indian Museum at Calcutta was a zoologist attached to this expedition. Three specimens were found on 29 December 1911 near the gorge of the Dihang River near Rotung. Although the nearest known velvet worm species, from Malaya, are typically found in dead wood, these were found mainly under large stones near the roots of trees. Subsequently some more specimens were found at the mouth of the Sireng stream and another specimen was found when the 32nd Sikkim Pioneers were working on the construction of a road between Upper Rotung and Rengin.
