He was a recipient of the Military Cross the prestigious award for \"gallantry during active operations against the enemy.\" He received the gallantry award for his part in the Battle of Guillemont where British troops defeated the Germans to take the German stronghold of Guillemont.\nMason began his theatrical career at the age of 16 and appeared in several productions at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre including Barry Jackson's The Christmas Party. During the 1920s he stage managed some of the largest shows in London (including many of Andr\u00e9 Charlot's musical revues) and began his film career with the arrival of sound in motion pictures. Mason was the Assistant director for I Was a Spy, which was very successful in the box office and voted best film of the year. He made his debut as director in 1936 with The First Offence. His most prominent film was A Window in London a dark thriller set in the London Underground, which was a remake of the original French drama film Metropolitan. Another successful film included Take My Tip, in which he directed Jack Hulbert whose \"dances [were] beautifully staged.\"Several rising actors and actresses (including Vivien Leigh) made their film debuts in some of his films before they rose to prominence. He worked for several studios and production companies including Gaumont British, Gainsborough Pictures, London Films and MGM-British Studios. Mason directed 16 films (from thrillers to comedies), moved into producing for the rest of his career and authored some plays with his wife Daisy Fisher, a novelist and playwright also with a background in theatre.His films were generally very well received, and some of them were marked out for the inventiveness of the plot, locations used for shooting and humour. Some of his films are remembered for introducing rising actors and actresses to the screen before they became famous.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Paul's Cathedral", "response": ["One of the best known images of London during the war was a photograph of St Paul's taken on 29 December 1940 during the \"Second Great Fire of London\" by photographer Herbert Mason, from the roof of a building in Tudor Street showing the cathedral shrouded in smoke.
