He is sometimes known as William Cartwright, Junior or William Cartwright the younger to distinguish him from his father, another William Cartwright (fl. 1598 \u2013 1636), an actor of the previous generation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Country Wife", "response": ["thumb|211px|right|Harcourt: Edward Kynaston played female roles in the 1660s. Pinchwife was played by the elderly Michael Mohun, who was best known for playing menacing villains, such as Volpone and Iago. Mrs. Pinchwife was Elizabeth Boutell or Bowtel, a young actress who had \"a childish look. Her voice was weak, tho' very mellow; she generally acted the young innocent lady whom all the heroes are mad in love with\".Thomas Betterton's description of Boutell, quoted by Ogden, xxx. Boutell's previous recorded roles had in fact all been unmarried as well as innocent girls, and Margery was her first married role.Howe, 181; note however that the records for this time are extremely incomplete. Matching Boutell and Mohun as a couple would emphasise \"her youth and innocence against Mohun's age and violence\".Ogden, xxx. The other husband to be cuckolded by Horner, Sir Jaspar Fidget, was played by another elderly actor, William Cartwright, best known for comic parts such as Falstaff. This casting suggests that Sir Jaspar was played as a straightforwardly comic part, while Pinchwife would be \"alarming as well as funny\"."]}, {"page": "Dulwich Picture Gallery", "response": ["Alleyn bequeathed the college of a collection of works including portraits of the kings and queens of England. The college retained connections with the theatre and in 1686, the actor William Cartwright (1606\u20131686) bequeathed a collection of 239 pictures, of which 80 are now identifiable at Dulwich. In the 18th century, the collection was displayed on the first floor of the wing of the Old College. It attracted few additions during this period, and recorded descriptions of the gallery suggest disappointment and apathy from its visitors.

They played for a time at the old Red Bull Theatre, but in 1663 the company moved to the new Theatre Royal in Drury Lane.

Killigrew staged plays by Aphra Behn, John Dryden, William Wycherley...and Thomas Killigrew, as well as revivals of Beaumont and Fletcher. Having inherited the rights and repertory of the old King's Men, the King's Company  performed many of Shakespeare's works, in the rewritten forms that were so popular at the time and so disparaged later.
