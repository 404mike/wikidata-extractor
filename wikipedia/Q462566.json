Many of her lyrics deal critically with the imperfections of humanity, everyday life, and politics. Especially in her early works she has created a gloomy, melancholy kind of atmosphere bordering on weltschmerz. She has been considered one of the pioneers in the spoken-word music genre, as well as being highly idolised over the board of techno-pop and new wave music, especially across Europe.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 14", "response": ["*1960 \u2013 Anne Clark, English singer-songwriter and poet"]}, {"page": "Psyche (band)", "response": ["A visit home to Waterloo in 1991 reunited the Huss brothers and, the subsequent recording sessions produced 1991's Daydream Avenue.
