A left-handed batsman and fine close fieldsman, he played for Cambridge University Cricket Club in 1932 and 1933. He then enjoyed a long county career as an amateur for Gloucestershire from 1932 to 1951, captaining the county in 1937 and 1938 and from 1947 to 1950.  He also played first-class matches for Marylebone Cricket Club from 1936 to 1939 and the Gentlemen in 1938.  \nAllen scored 14 first-class hundreds, with his only double century, 220, coming against Hampshire in 1947. His best season was 1938, when he scored 1785 runs at an average of 34.32.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clifton College", "response": ["* Basil Allen, cricketer, Gloucestershire captain"]}, {"page": "Wally Hammond", "response": ["Appointed as Gloucestershire captain for the 1939 season, Hammond led the team to third in the County Championship and recorded a rare double victory over Yorkshire. While Wisden commended his adventurous style of leadership, others such as Basil Allen, his predecessor as captain, did not approve; their main criticism was his failure to encourage his players.Howat, p. 91.Foot, pp. 103, 105, 165. In first-class cricket, he scored 2,479 runs at an average of 63.56. He placed at the top of the first-class averages for the seventh successive season, although some critics detected a decline in his abilities. While he led England to a 1\u20130 series victory over West Indies in three Tests, Wisden reported some criticism of his captaincy. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said that \"Hammond does not rank among the more imaginative England captains\", although he concluded by defending Hammond as \"experienced and sound\". In the second match, he took his 100th catch in Tests, and in the third, he scored 138, his final Test century. In the series, Hammond scored 279 runs (average 55.80). The impending war overshadowed much of the season; throughout the Tests, Hammond made public appeals for citizens to join the armed forces.Howat, p. 90. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the services and was commissioned as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) in October 1939.Howat, p. 93."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Gloucestershire's strong challenge for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. Playfair recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom was waiting in the wings. Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.Playfair, pp. 85\u201387.", "* 43 \u2013 Basil Allen (Gloucestershire; 30)\t"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire cricket captains", "response": ["| scope=\"row\" align=\"left\" | Basil Allen "]}, {"page": "List of Old Cliftonians", "response": ["* Basil Allen, cricketer, Gloucestershire captain"]}, {"page": "Derrick Bailey", "response": ["At the end of the 1950 season, Basil Allen, who had captained Gloucestershire in 1937\u201338 and from 1947 to 1950, retired, and Sir Derrick Bailey was appointed as his successor for the 1951 season, having been one of only a handful of amateur cricketers who had played for the county in the previous two years."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Basil Allen (1932\u20131951) : B.
