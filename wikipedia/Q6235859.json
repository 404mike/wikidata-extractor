Thorp, as an extension to the Municipal Buildings to the west (built 1878\u201384 by George Corson, now housing Leeds Central Library). It opened on 3 October 1888 as Leeds City Art Gallery and was paid for by public subscription, collected in honour of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887. It was opened by the Mayor, Alderman Scarr, with the artist Hubert von Herkomer in attendance.

All other galleries were lit by daylight from rooflights. The new building had a central court of two storeys with a glass roof and a fountain of Burmatofts faience.
