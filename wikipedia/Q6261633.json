In later life, he also worked as a postman.On 14 December 1991, while playing in a Third Division game for Torquay United at Plainmoor, he suffered a fractured cheekbone and eye socket in a collision with Brentford striker Gary Blissett, who was subsequently charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent. However, Blissett was cleared of the charge at Salisbury Crown Court on 3 December 1992.He now lives in Howden, East Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gary Blissett", "response": ["In December 1992, Blissett was acquitted of GBH after challenging for an aerial ball with Torquay United player John Uzzell in an away game at Plainmoor 12 months earlier. It was alleged by Uzzell that Blissett had deliberately elbowed him in the face, fracturing his eye socket, although the court did not agree with this. Blissett has always maintained that the incident was an accidental collision and video evidence of the challenge was deemed to show that Blissett kept his eyes on the ball and, furthermore, that in jumping to head an aerial ball, a player would typically raise one or both arms to gain height."]}, {"page": "Uzzell", "response": ["*John Uzzell (born 1959), British footballer"]}, {"page": "Uzzell, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Uzzell"]}]}}
