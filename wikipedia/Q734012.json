The Blades also agreed a deal to take two young midfielders, John Fleck and Kyle Hutton, on loan from Rangers for the remainder of the season, but the deal subsequently fell through due to issues with the paperwork involved.  The team kicked off September by crushing Bury 4\u20130 at Bramall Lane, and then travelled to Scunthorpe United where they maintained their unbeaten start after coming from behind to grab a 1\u20131 draw.  Off the field the restructuring of the club continued with the appointment of former Blades player Julian Winter as Chief Executive to replace the departing Trevor Birch.  Danny Wilson added to his defensive options by signing Marcus Williams on a months loan from Reading, with the defender making his d\u00e9but only hours later, although he was unable to prevent the Blades from crashing to their first league defeat of the season as they were trounced 3\u20130 at home by Huddersfield Town.  Despite this setback the Blades quickly returned to winning ways, reversing the previous scoreline to crush Colchester United 3\u20130 at Bramall Lane.  The month ended on a low note however as the team suffered a shock defeat at struggling Wycombe Wanderers, although they still managed to hold onto second place in the table."]}, {"page": "Kal Naismith", "response": ["On 20 September 2010, Naismith and fellow Rangers player Kyle Hutton, were abducted in Edinburgh by two men and driven around the city in Hutton's car before they were dumped in the Niddrie area of Edinburgh.
