Before the creation of Llandaff Cathedral, it became established as a Christian place of worship in the 6th century AD, probably because of its location as the first firm ground north of the point where the river Taff met the Bristol Channel, and because of its pre-Christian location as a river crossing on a north\u2013south trade route.  Evidence of Romano-British ritual burials have been found under the present cathedral.  The date of the moving of the cathedral to Llandaff is disputed, but elements of the fabric date from the 12th century, such as the impressive Romanesque Urban Arch, named after the 12th century Bishop, Urban.  It has had a history of continual destruction and restoration, as a result of warfare, neglect, and natural disaster.  Llandaff has been a focal point of devastating attacks by Owain Glynd\u0175r and Oliver Cromwell.  It was the second most damaged cathedral in the UK (after Coventry Cathedral), following Luftwaffe bombing during World War II, and subsequently restored by the architect George Pace.  One of its main modern points of interest is the aluminium figure of Christ in Majesty (1954\u20135), by Jacob Epstein, which is suspended above the nave.  In 2007, a lightning strike to its spire sent a surge through the building; which destroyed its organ.
