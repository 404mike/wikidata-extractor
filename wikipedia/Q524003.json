He turned professional in 1982 and was in his prime from 1985 to 1987, finishing in the top thirty of the European Tour Order of Merit each of those years. He twice shot 27 for nine holes on the tour, first at the 1985 Monte Carlo Open, and again two years later at the 1987 Portuguese Open. He went on to win the latter, one of his two victories on the European Tour. He also seriously competed for the 1985 Open Championship in the opening rounds. He was in second place after the first round and only two back after the second round. He faded over the weekend but picked up a top-25 finish.\nFrom the late 1980s Lee's form dipped, and he spent the latter half of the 1990s going back and forth between the second-tier Challenge Tour and the main European Tour. Since leaving the tour at the end of the 1999 season, Lee has worked as an analyst for Sky Sports.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Robert Lee \u2013 Sky Sports 2000\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Robert Lee", "response": ["Robert Lee may refer to:", "* Robert Lee, 4th Earl of Lichfield (1706\u20131776), British peer and politician", "* Robert Lee (Canadian politician) (1862\u20131925), mayor of Edmonton, Alberta", "* Robert Lee (Lord Mayor) (died 1605), English merchant who was Lord Mayor of London in 1602", "* Robert Lee (obstetrician) (1793\u20131877), Regius Professor of Midwifery, University of Glasgow", "* Robert Lee (historian) (1959\u20132010), English historian", "* Robert Lee (golfer) (born 1961), English golfer", "* Robert Lee (canoeist) (born 1956), member of the Australian sprint canoe team at the 1980 Summer Olympics", "* Robert Lee (basketball) (born 1968), head coach of the Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns men's basketball team", "* Robert Lee (voice actor) (born 1957), narrator of MythBusters", "* Robert Lee (minister) (1804\u20131868), 19th-century Church of Scotland minister", "* Robert Lee, Lord Lee (1830\u20131890) Scottish law lord, Senator of the College of Justice, Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh", "* Robert Lee (dentist) (1920\u20132010), American dentist who emigrated to Ghana", "* Robert Lee Jun-fai (born 1948), Hong Kong musician and the brother of Bruce Lee", "* Robert Lee (teacher) (1837\u20131922), New Zealand teacher, school inspector, and educationalist", "* Robert Lee (sports announcer), American sports announcer, currently works for ESPN", "* Robert Lee, Texas, a US city named after the general"]}, {"page": "Open de Portugal", "response": ["| 1987 || EUR ||  Robert Lee || align=center|195 || align=\"center\" |\u221212 || 1 stroke ||  Sam Torrance || Estoril"]}, {"page": "Cannes Open", "response": ["| 1985 ||  Robert Lee || align=\"center\" |280 || align=center|\u22128 || Playoff ||  David Llewellyn|| Cannes Mougins || "]}, {"page": "David Llewellyn (golfer)", "response": ["| Robert Lee"]}, {"page": "Mike Miller (golfer)", "response": ["| Phil Harrison,  Robert Lee", "| Phil Harrison,  Robert Lee"]}, {"page": "Kenya Open", "response": ["| 1996 || CHA ||  Mike Miller || align=center|272 || align=center|\u221212 || Playoff ||  Phil Harrison Robert Lee || Muthaiga || "]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Robert Lee||1961\u2013"]}, {"page": "1986 Open Championship", "response": ["|Robert Lee||"]}, {"page": "1985 Open Championship", "response": ["|Robert Lee||", "|Robert Lee||||align=center |68-73=141"]}, {"page": "Brazil Open (golf)", "response": ["| 1985 ||  Robert Lee || 272 (E) || 1 stroke ||  Eduardo Romero Ronan Rafferty Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn Adan Sowa Horacio Carbonetti "]}, {"page": "1985 European Tour", "response": ["| Robert Lee (1)"]}, {"page": "1987 European Tour", "response": ["| Robert Lee (2)"]}, {"page": "1996 Challenge Tour", "response": ["| 2\u20135\u00a0May || Canarias Challenge || Spain ||  Robert Lee || ", "|align=center|3 || Robert Lee || || align=center|33,990"]}, {"page": "1998 Challenge Tour", "response": ["| 30\u00a0Jun \u2013 3\u00a0Jul || MasterCard Challenge || England ||  Robert Lee || "]}, {"page": "Formby Hall Challenge", "response": ["| 1998 || Princes || Robert Lee ||  || 277"]}, {"page": "Canarias Challenge", "response": ["| 1996 ||Robert Lee ||  || align=center|268 || align=center|\u221216 || 5 strokes ||  Simon Burnell Joakim Rask||1996 Canarias Challenge, European Tour, 5 May 19961996 Canarias Challenge, Golfdata, accessed 14 September 2016 "]}, {"page": "List of The Open Championship broadcasters", "response": ["Beginning in 2016, Sky Sports will have exclusive UK rights to The Open with the BBC showing a 2-hour highlights programme every night instead of live coverage.
