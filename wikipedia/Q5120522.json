The exception would be if the U.S. were to claim that the treaty obligations violate the United States Constitution. Many articles in these treaties\u2014such as Article 35 and Article 36 of the Single Convention\u2014are prefaced with phrases such as \"Having due regard to their constitutional, legal and administrative systems, the Parties shall . . .\" or \"Subject to its constitutional limitations, each Party shall . . .\" According to former United Nations Drug Control Programme Chief of Demand Reduction Cindy Fazey, \"This has been used by the USA not to implement part of article 3 of the 1988 Convention, which prevents inciting others to use narcotic or psychotropic drugs, on the basis that this would be in contravention of their constitutional amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech\".fuoriluogo.it \u2013 aprile 2003 "]}, {"page": "Drug policy of the Netherlands", "response": ["The International Narcotics Control Board typically interprets this provision to mean that states must prosecute drug possession offenses.

This is at least partially correct; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(d)(2)(B) of the Controlled Substances Act states that if the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs proposes rescheduling a drug, the HHS Secretary \"shall evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on the representative of the United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal\".

However, Professor Cindy Fazey's A Growing Market: The Domestic Cultivation of Cannabis points out, \"Whilst this strategy may be practical politics for some countries, critics will ask why it has taken almost half a century to discover that the UN conventions conflict with a constitutional principle. The argument is particularly difficult to deploy for countries like Britain, where constitutional principles are not formalized or codified to any significant degree.\" However the current move in Switzerland to enshrine cannabis decriminalization in the national constitution by popular initiative could profit from this rule.", "The reason for sharply limiting the scope of Single Convention to a few types of drugs while letting the Convention on Psychotropic Drugs cover the rest was concern for the interests of industry. Professor Cindy Fazey's The Mechanics and Dynamics of the UN System for International Drug Control explains, \"concerted efforts by drug manufacturing nations and the pharmaceutical industry ensured that the controls on psychotropics in the 1971 treaty were considerably looser than those applied to organic drugs in the Single Convention.\"", "Cindy Fazey, former Chief of Demand Reduction for the United Nations Drug Control Programme, has pointed out that it would be nearly impossible to loosen international cannabis regulations. Even if the Commission on Narcotic Drugs removed cannabis from Schedule IV of the Single Convention, prohibitions against the plant would remain imbedded in Article 28 and other parts of the treaty. Fazey cited amendment of the Articles and state-by-state denunciation as two theoretical possibilities for changing cannabis' international legal status, while pointing out that both face substantial barriers."]}, {"page": "International Narcotics Control Board", "response": ["In April 2003, former UNODC Chief of Demand Reduction Cindy Fazey penned a scathing review of the Board, accusing it of overstepping its bounds:"]}, {"page": "United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances", "response": ["Previous drug control treaties had targeted drug manufacturers and traffickers, rather than users.

Consequently, it was not only the duty of producing countries (e.g. the developing countries of Asia and South America) to suppress illicit supply, but also the duty of consumer countries (e.g. the industrialized countries of Europe and North America) to suppress the demand for drugs.\"", "The road to repeal would be difficult. Individual nations could withdraw from the treaty under the provisions of Article 30.
