This work became popular on both sides of the Atlantic, being performed at the John Street Theatre in New York on 5 June 1793. Its use of blackface acting is considered an influence into the 19th century; it featured a contrast of the stage Irish and African servant.

In 1778, John Larpent was appointed inspector of plays by the Marquis of Hertford, who was then Lord Chamberlain. He preserved manuscript copies of all the plays submitted to the inspector from 1737 to his death in 1824, including those produced at the theatre in Wisbech.DNB (cf. Notes and Queries, 2nd ser. iv. 269) Buildings in Wisbech in Pickard's Lane  and on the Sutton road were used as theatres in the 18th century. The Whitley and Herbert company of comedians performed in the town during Wisbech Race Week in June 1777. In 1778 or 1779 Italian writer Giuseppe Marc'Antonio Baretti attended a theatre performance here. Other early theatres in Wisbech, referred to in newspapers and other documents, appear to have been temporary structures such as that erected near the High street by the company of James Augustus \"Jemmy\" Whitley (c. 1724\u20131781) for a season in 1779. Whitley announced, in 1779, an intention to build an elegant and extensive structure for the 1780 season. With Whitley's death, however, that theatre was never built, and the way was left open for the development of a theatre in Wisbech by others. The Theatrical Representations Act 1788 allowed local magistrates to license occasional performances for periods of up to 60 days."]}, {"page": "Larpent, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Larpent"]}]}}
