Shackleton was elected yet he did not act upon his promise made to Eva.  This led to the founding of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Worker's Representation Committee by Eva Gore-Booth, Esther Roper and Sarah Reddish.  The setting up of this committee led to Eva Gore-Booth meeting Christabel Pankhurst who also felt strongly about women's rights.  However, in 1904, Christabel caused some controversy in the Women's Trade Union Council as she attempted to force the council to make women's suffrage one of its aims to which they refused.  This led to the resignation of Eva Gore-Booth from the council. Resigning from that particular council, Eva Gore-Booth alongside Sarah Dickenson who had also resigned, set up the Manchester and Salford Women's Trade and Labour Council.  As part of this council, Eva and other suffragists used constitutional methods of campaigning.  In the general election of 1906, they put forward their own candidate, Thorley Smith yet he was defeated.  In May 1906 Eva was present in the suffrage deputation to Campbell Bannerman.  Her true feeling of helplessness after the failure of this deputation was captured in two poems, which she wrote.  These poems were titled 'Women's Trades on the Embankment' and 'A Lost Opportunity'."]}, {"page": "1931 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Sarah Dickenson  Member of the Manchester and District War Pensions Committee.
