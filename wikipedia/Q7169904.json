Following mid-table finishes in the 1980\u201381 and 1981\u201382 seasons under manager John Bond, City were relegated out of the First Division in 1982\u201383 under new boss John Benson. Now under the stewardship of Billy McNeill, they finished fourth in the Second Division in 1983\u201384, missing out on promotion by a ten-point margin. Despite this, Williams was voted onto the PFA Team of the Year, along with teammate Mick McCarthy. Promotion was instead achieved in 1984\u201385, after they secured the third and final promotion place by beating fourth placed Portsmouth's goal difference tally.
