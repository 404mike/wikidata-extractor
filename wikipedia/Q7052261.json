Davies argued that the group's flaw was \"the relentless refusal to actually bring anything down to brass tacks\" and that they would demand action on various issues without following through on implementation. According to Davies, \"it was this refusal to step down from Mount Olympus that finally did for the Euston Manifesto group. In the early days, it allowed them to assemble a broad coalition, uniting war supporters and opponents under a vague banner of 'that Galloway chappie has gone a bit too far'. But almost as soon as the manifesto was published, it ran into its first big real-world test as Israel invaded Lebanon, and the strains began to show between those Eustonauts like Norman Geras, who had taken seriously the universalist stuff about human rights, and the Atlanticist element who had always assumed that they were joining a movement that would be happy to set all that stuff aside in the name of getting the bad guys\".Next stop Euston.

Norman Geras's Marx and Human Nature (1983), however, offers an argument against this position.See in particular Chapter Two In outline, Geras shows that, while the social relations are held to \"determine\" the nature of people, they are not the only such determinant. However, Marx makes statements where he specifically refers to a human nature which is more than what is conditioned by the circumstances of one's life. In Capital, in a footnote critiquing utilitarianism, he says that utilitarians must reckon with \"human nature in general, and then with human nature as modified in each historical epoch\". Marx is arguing against an abstract conception of human nature, offering instead an account rooted in sensuous life. While he is quite explicit that \"[a]s individuals express their life, so they are. Hence what individuals are depends on the material conditions of their production\", he also believes that human nature will condition (against the background of the productive forces and relations of production) the way in which individuals express their life. History involves \"a continuous transformation of human nature\", though this does not mean that every aspect of human nature is wholly variable; what is transformed need not be wholly transformed.", "In the Grundrisse Marx says his nature is a \"totality of needs and drives\". In The German Ideology he uses the formulation: \"their needs, consequently their nature\". We can see then, that from Marx's early writing to his later work, he conceives of human nature as composed of \"tendencies\", \"drives\", \"essential powers\", and \"instincts\" to act in order to satisfy \"needs\" for external objectives. For Marx then, an explanation of human nature is an explanation of the needs of humans, together with the assertion that they will act to fulfill those needs. (c.f. The German Ideology, chapter 3).. Norman Geras gives a schedule of some of the needs which Marx says are characteristic of humans:", "...for other human beings, for sexual relations, for food, water, clothing, shelter, rest and, more generally, for circumstances that are conducive to health rather than disease. There is another one ... the need of people for a breadth and diversity of pursuit and hence of personal development, as Marx himself expresses these, 'all-round activity', 'all-round development of individuals', 'free development of individuals', 'the means of cultivating [one's] gifts in all directions', and so on.Norman Geras, quoting Marx in his Marx and Human Nature (1983, p. 72) ", "* Marx and Human Nature: Refutation of a Legend by Norman Geras (1983) is a concise argument against the view that Marx did not believe there was something such as human nature, in particular the confusion surrounding the sixth of the Theses on Feuerbach."]}, {"page": "Normblog", "response": ["#REDIRECT Norman Geras"]}, {"page": "Engage (organisation)", "response": ["In 2005, the Association of University Teachers (AUT) took a decision to boycott two Israeli universities.David Newman (2008) Britain and the Academic Boycott of Israel, Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, 2:2, 45-55, DOI: 10.1080/23739770.2008.11446311  Engage was founded, by David Hirsh, who teaches at Goldsmiths, University of London, and Jon Pike, who teaches at the Open University, in order to try to reverse this, which, with the involvement of Academic Friends of Israel, occurred within a few weeks. Supporters of Engage included the late Norman Geras and the late David Cesarani. In 2006, the AUT merged with the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, and proposed a Boycott Israel measure that Hirsh, speaking on behalf of Engage, called \"nastier\" than the 2005 proposal, because it proposed the boycott of individual academics who refused to disassociate themselves with Israel. Hirsh was also quoted in relation to a proposed boycott of Israeli academic institutions by the University and College Union in 2007. One effective takeaway from Engage's efforts has been that the UCU has conceded that their sought-after boycott efforts are largely theoretical and have been meaningless as the British government has made it clear that it will use legal means to dismiss those efforts if they're ever tried."]}, {"page": "Sophie Hannah", "response": ["Sophie Hannah was born in Manchester, England; her father was the academic Norman Geras and her mother is the author Ad\u00e8le Geras.
