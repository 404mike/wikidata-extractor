In 1985\u201386 he struck up a successful partnership with fellow new signing Milton Graham at Chester City, with Kelly scoring eight times as Chester were promoted from Division Four. A year later he moved up to the second tier with Swindon Town for \u00a320,000, although he struggled to establish himself with the Wiltshire club and soon moved on to Oldham Athletic.\nAfter spells with Walsall and Huddersfield Town, Kelly returned to Chester in the summer of 1992. Unfortunately, the 1992\u201393 season brought relegation to Division Three and Kelly was released at the end of the campaign. This marked the end of his professional career and he went part-time by joining Welsh side Rhyl.\nKelly made two appearances for the Republic of Ireland U21s, a nation he was eligible to represent as his father was born in Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Kelly", "response": ["*John Kelly (engineer), Irish professor, former Registrar of University College Dublin", "*John Kelly (scholar) (1750\u20131809), at Douglas, Isle of Man", "*John Kelly (actor) (1901\u20131947), American film actor whose credits include Meet Dr. Christian", "*John Kelly (artist) (born 1965), Australian artist", "*John Kelly (author) (born 1964), British author and illustrator", "*John Kelly (born 1978), member of the Doctor Who Restoration Team", "*John Kelly (Irish broadcaster) (born 1965), Irish radio broadcaster and presenter of The View", "*John Kelly (performance artist) (born 1959), American performance artist, visual artist and writer", "*John Kelly (Sinn F\u00e9in politician) (1936\u20132007), Northern Irish republican leader", "*John Kelly (New York politician) (1822\u20131886), politician in Tammany Hall, U.S. Representative from New York (1855\u20131858)", "*John Kelly (Brooklyn politician) (1855\u20131900), American politician from New York", "*John Kelly (bailiff) (c. 1793\u20131854), Member of the House of Keys and High Bailiff of Castletown, Isle of Man", "*John Kelly (Canadian politician) (1852\u20131934), municipal councillor in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada", "*John Kelly (New South Wales politician) (1840\u20131896), Australian politician", "*John Kelly (Roscommon politician) (born 1960), Irish Labour Party Senator", "*John Kelly of Killanne (died 1798), leader of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 in Wexford", "*John Kelly (Royal Navy officer) (1871\u20131936), British Admiral of the Fleet", "*John Kelly (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u2013?), English footballer for York City", "*John Kelly (footballer, born 1913) (1913\u2013?), English footballer for Bradford City", "*John Kelly (footballer, born 1921) (1921\u20132001), Scottish international football player (Barnsley)", "*John Kelly (footballer, born 1935), Scottish footballer for Crewe Alexandra", "*John Kelly (footballer, born 1960), Anglo-Irish soccer player whose clubs included Tranmere Rovers, Preston", "*John Kelly (offensive lineman) (born 1944), American football player", "*John Kelly (running back) (born 1996), American football running back", "*John Kelly (rugby, born 1917), English former rugby union and professional rugby league footballer", "*John Kelly (rugby union, born 1974), Irish rugby union player", "*John Kelly (boxer) (1932\u20132016), Northern Irish boxer", "*John Kelly (catcher) (1859\u20131908), 1879\u20131884 baseball player", "*John Kelly (equestrian) (born 1930), Australian Olympic equestrian", "*John Kelly (golfer) (born 1984), American amateur golfer", "*John Kelly (Lancashire and Derbyshire cricketer) (1922\u20131979), English cricketer", "*John Kelly (Nottinghamshire cricketer) (1930\u20132008), English cricketer", "*John Kelly (outfielder) (1879\u20131944), 1907 baseball player", "*John Kelly (racewalker) (1929\u20132012), Irish Olympic athlete", "*John Kelly (sportscaster) (born 1960), ice hockey sportscaster", "*John Kelly (Tipperary hurler) (born 1948), Irish retired sportsperson", "*John Kelly (runner) (born 1984), American endurance athlete", "*John Kelly (1840\u20131904), British architect specialising in churches, see Kelly & Birchall", "*John Kelly (diplomat) (born 1941), British diplomat and Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands", "*John Kelly (minister) (1801\u20131876), Congregational minister", "*John Kelly (John Clark), character in a number of Tom Clancy novels", "*John Kelly (NYPD Blue), character on the TV series NYPD Blue, played by David Caruso", "*John Kelly Girls' Technology College"]}, {"page": "Milton Graham", "response": ["In 1985, he dropped down a division by joining Division Four side Chester City, where he was to enjoy tremendous popularity over the next four years.
