On 2 April the division was told to supply a brigade for the coming battle at the next line at Wadi Akarit, which runs from the sea to impassable salt marshes of the Chott el Fejej, while the Germans were distracted by the advance of Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. II Corps to the west. The 69th Brigade was sent forward with the division machine gunners and a squadron of tanks from the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters), but they were not to be supported by the divisional artillery as all available transport was being used to move Eighth Army supplies. Fire support was to come from the 51st (Highland) Division's artillery, the infantry of which were to attack on their right, while the 4th Indian Division attacked on their left. In the early morning of 6 April, the attack achieved its early objectives but then came under heavy fire which killed Lieutenant Colonel Seagrim, who had won the V.C. only recently. The 5th East Yorkshires' leading company suffered over 70% casualties, and during this attack Private Eric Anderson won a posthumous V.C., killed while attending to the wounded on the battlefield. The 6th Green Howards now passed through the first wave and also took casualties: By 11:00 the battle was over, the tanks of the Yeomanry having got past the anti-tank ditch, and four hours later the 8th Armoured Brigade pushed on past the Wadi.Delaforce pp.\u00a040\u201343 The brigade had overrun parts of the Italian La Spezia Division.Cheal p. 61"]}, {"page": "East Yorkshire Regiment", "response": ["*Private Eric Anderson, Second World War"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (E)", "response": ["# Eric Anderson (VC)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Bradford", "response": ["* Eric Anderson, VC \u2013 (1915\u20131943) recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

This involved a tricky approach march in the dark before the artillery barrage began. 7th Green Howards took their objective, an outpost on Point 85, but then they and 5th East Yorkshires could not get across the anti-tank ditch. A Company in the lead for 5th East Yorkshires was advancing over an exposed forward slope when it came under intense and accurate machine gun and mortar fire from well-concealed enemy strongpoints about  away. The company withdrew behind the crest, leaving a number of wounded pinned down. Private Eric Anderson, a stretcher-bearer with the company, went out alone over the bullet-swept slope to rescue wounded men four times. He saved three men but on the fourth occasion he was hit and mortally wounded while administering first aid. He was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for this action.London Gazette, 29 July 1943. Casualties mounted, both battalions were pinned down with their COs wounded. However, the 6th Green Howards and the supporting tank squadron of 4th County of London Yeomanry were able to cross behind the neighbouring brigade of 51st (Highland) Division and cut behind the defenders. 5th East Yorkshires were then able to cross over and help the 4th Indian Division, rounding up many Italian prisoners.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 366, 370\u20132; Map 35."]}]}}
