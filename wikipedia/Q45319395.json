Broadrick's usage of the title spans back to his work in the 1990s with Kevin Martin in Techno Animal, but he first released a solo studio album as JK Flesh in 2012. Unlike Broadrick's most well-known projects, Godflesh and Jesu, his work as JK Flesh is electronic and (apart from Posthuman) lacks metal riffs. Over the years, the project has shifted into a more minimal and dub sound while retaining its industrial influences.\nAs JK Flesh, Broadrick has released four studio albums, five EPs, a split album with Prurient, and a number of remixes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Justin Broadrick", "response": ["Justin Karl Michael Broadrick (born 15 August 1969) is an English musician, singer and songwriter. He is best known as a founding member of the band Godflesh, one of the first bands to combine elements of extreme metal and industrial music. He was briefly in the English grindcore band Napalm Death when he was a teenager in the mid-1980s, writing and recording guitar for their debut album, Scum. Broadrick has also maintained a parallel career as a producer, producing records and remixes for groups such as Pantera, Isis, Mogwai and Hydra Head labelmates Pelican. Since the 1990s he has worked with Kevin Martin as Techno Animal making various genres of electronic music and hip hop. Since 2012, he has been releasing hard techno music under the solo moniker JK Flesh. Broadrick has set up record labels such as HeadDirt, Avalanche Recordings, Post Mortem Productions (briefly renamed Uprising Productions), Lo Fibre and Heartache.", "In 1994, Godflesh released their album Selfless on Columbia Records and sold approximately 180,000 copies. Broadrick joined Kevin Martin's band GOD as a guitarist for their second and final album The Anatomy of Addiction. The duo recorded the second Techno Animal album, Re-Entry, which was released as a two-disc CD through Virgin Records in 1995. Broadrick was more influenced by hip-hop and dub music when Godflesh recorded the fourth album, Songs of Love and Hate, with live drummer Bryan Mantia. Broadrick also recorded the second Final full-length that was released on Rawkus Records. In 1997, Godflesh released the electronic remix record Love and Hate in Dub. \"What Kevin and I were doing with Techno Animal then began to rub off on Godflesh, and vice versa\", Broadrick says. From 1997 to 1999, Martin and Broadrick released two Techno Animal compilations, Versus Reality and Radio Hades, a split album with Porter Ricks. They also start a new project titled Curse of the Golden Vampire with Alec Empire. Broadrick also had recorded tracks as JK Flesh during this time but they were released in 2009 in the compilation album From Hell. He turned down offers to join both Faith No More and Danzig. Broadrick released drum and bass music under numerous pseudonyms such as Cylon, Tech Level 2 and Youpho. He also recorded such music with Kevin Martin under the names White Viper and Eraser. At that time, they were influenced by acts like Ed Rush and Dillinja, and labels like No U-Turn and Renegade Hardware.", "Broadrick released the album Posthuman under the JK Flesh project name on 30 April 2012. Although many of Broadrick's projects feature him performing all instrumentation anyway, the album is considered to be Broadrick's first solo album. ", "In April 2012, Valley of Fear, a new project of Broadrick, Matthew Bower and Samantha Davies, released an album of noise rock and black metal experiments on Legion Blotan Records. On 11 December, a split release between JK Flesh and Prurient called Worship Is the Cleansing of the Imagination was released on Hydra Head Records.

Though Broadrick quickly became interested in writing music under the Godflesh title again, he presumed the band to be permanently dead. He and Green remained friendly throughout the 2000s, but they rarely if ever spoke about the band. In 2009, though, Broadrick decided to approach Green with the idea of reforming Godflesh.

It is Broadrick's third release under the JK Flesh title, following the debut studio album, Posthuman (2012), and a split album with Prurient, Worship Is the Cleansing of the Imagination (2012).", "Unlike Posthuman, Nothing Is Free adopts a sparser, more sterile drum and bass sound. Most of the traditional metal riffs are gone and replaced with abrasive washes of bass and other synthesizer noises, which Broadrick saw as a more honest realization of what he set out to do with the JK Flesh project. The EP has been noted for its high level of aural aggression as well as ability to be both disturbing and danceable. The tracks on the album are slower and more darkly psychedelic than those on Posthuman, with Broadrick commenting \"I love working in that slowish, 80 to 90 BPM, super fucking gray area.

In keeping with the JK Flesh evolution, nearly all elements of industrial metal are gone from this album and replaced with starker, more synthetic sounds. John Twells of Fact wrote, \"The doomy, distorted grind of Godflesh and Jesu is certainly still present, but woven into a wheezing 4/4 template that doesn\u2019t sound a million miles from Andy Stott\u2019s patented 'knackered house' or a Surgeon record on the wrong speed being played through a broken car stereo.\" Chang Terhune of Igloo Magazine also drew comparisons between Rise Above and the work of Andy Stott. Heathen Harvest likened the album's percussion driven approach to early industrial albums: \"The predominant sound is that of the factory: machines, machines, and more machines.\"", "According to Broadrick, his vision for JK Flesh was only fully realized with Rise Above. About the deliberate shift away from guitar and industrial beats, he said, \"Wildly divisive, its lack of guitars and its adherence to 4/4 techno, has led to a misunderstanding of this project's intentions, but I find this is positive. I'm doing something \u2018real', and I'm doing it because I need and love doing it.
