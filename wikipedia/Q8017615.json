McNabb was among the early Catholic ecumenists, seeking in particular to promote reunion between the Catholic Church and the Anglicans. Towards the end of his life, he wrote, \"God knows how much I have striven and prayed to mend the shattered unity of Christendom.\" As a young priest, he came under the influence of the convert bishop of Clifton, William Robert Brownlow, who, after his reception into the Catholic Church by John Henry Newman, not only kept many Anglican friendships but made others among Nonconformists. Brownlow was the author of a work breathing a strong ecumenical spirit titled Catholics and Nonconformists: or Dialogues on Conversion (1898). McNabb regarded him as one of his \"masters and heroes\" and wrote his biography. While prior at Woodchester, McNabb was in correspondence with Anglicans on both sides of the Atlantic. He was host to his Cotswolds neighbour, the Rev. Spencer Jones, rector of Moreton-in-Marsh, leading Anglo-Catholic and author of England and the Holy See: An Essay Towards Reunion (1902). He also contributed to the early issues of The Lamp, a paper edited by Fr. Paul Wattson, who, after becoming a Catholic, was to promote the Unity Octave through it for almost half a century. McNabb's lifelong interest in ecumenism culminated in his book The Church and Reunion (1937), published six years before his death."]}]}}
