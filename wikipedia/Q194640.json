He was educated at Sedbergh School. He was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Best Art Direction for the film The French Lieutenant's Woman and was the BAFTA nominated art director for Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film Blowup.\nGorton had lived in Church Stoke in Powys, Wales since 1976. He died there in his sleep on 14 September 2014; he was 84. He was the son of Neville Gorton, Bishop of Coventry from 1943 to 1952, formerly headmaster of Blundell's School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Production Design", "response": ["| Assheton Gorton"]}, {"page": "Blowup", "response": ["| Assheton Gorton"]}, {"page": "Legend (1985 film)", "response": ["The look Scott envisioned for Legend was influenced by the style of Disney animation. He had even offered the project to Disney, but they were intimidated by the film's dark tone at a time when Disney still focused on family-friendly material. Visually, Scott referenced films like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Pinocchio. The look of Legend was also influenced by the art of Arthur Rackham and Heath Robinson.Jones 1986, p. 24. Scott had initially sought the services of conceptual designer Brian Froud, but was turned down. He then hired Alan Lee as a visual consultant, who drew some characters and sketched environments. However, Scott eventually replaced Lee with Assheton Gorton, a production designer whom he had wanted for both Alien and Blade Runner. Scott hired Gorton because he knew \"all the pitfalls of shooting exteriors on a soundstage. We both knew that whatever we did would never look absolutely real, but would very quickly gain its own reality and dispense with any feeling of theatricality\".", "Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Bottin's makeup and Assheton Gorton's set design and the performances of Tim Curry and Tom Cruise, but noted that the effects were so good that the roles could have been played by almost anyone. Ebert also said that the movie was composed of all of the right ingredients to be successful, but that the film simply \"doesn't work\". He went on to say that \"[a]ll of the special effects in the world, and all of the great makeup, and all of the great Muppet creatures can't save a movie that has no clear idea of its own mission and no joy in its own accomplishment\". However, with the release of the 2002 Director's Cut, he agreed with many fans on how it was intended to question the balance between good and evil, and gives the main characters moral flaws to display the imperfections of humans. The release of the Director's Cut in 2002 also had the original score from Jerry Goldsmith restored, and brought renewed attention to the film. Both Ridley Scott and Tom Cruise have requested their fans to view this version, even to the extent of Cruise disowning the US version entirely as a \"stereotypical 80's fantasy\"."]}, {"page": "Songs for a Dying Planet", "response": ["* Assheton Gorton \u2013 artwork (\"Three Men in a Boat\")"]}, {"page": "Sedbergh School", "response": ["*Assheton Gorton, Production designer and Academy Award nominee"]}, {"page": "The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)", "response": ["Harold Pinter and Karel Reisz worked on the script in 1979, with Leon Clore as producer, and with whom Reisz regularly worked in their company Film Contracts, formed many years earlier.

Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \"an astonishingly beautiful film, acted to the elegant hilt by Meryl Streep as the ultimately unreliable Sarah; Jeremy Irons, who looks a lot like the young Laurence Olivier of Wuthering Heights, as Charles Smithson, and by a cast of splendid supporting actors of the sort that only England seems to possess.\"Canby, Vincent, \"Screen: 'The French Lieutenant's Woman, The New York Times,18 September 1981, C4.
