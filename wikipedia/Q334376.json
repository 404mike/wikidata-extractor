The Labour Party of Scotland selected George MacLean to be its candidate, pitting him against Labour's George Machin, the SNP's Gordon Wilson and Conservative candidate William Fitzgerald, then Lord Provost of Dundee.

In a closely fought contest, George Machin took the seat with a majority of 1,141, despite Labour's vote share declining by 15.6%. This was largely down to the strong performance of the SNP, who increased its own by 21.2%.
