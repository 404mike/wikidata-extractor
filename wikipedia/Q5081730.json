Powlett held an important position in the administration of cricket and was a member of the committee which revised and codified the Laws of Cricket in 1774.Powlett (sometimes spelled Paulet) was the eldest son, born illegitimately, of Charles Powlett, 3rd Duke of Bolton and Lavinia Fenton, who were not married until 1751 when he was 23.  Powlett was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as MA in 1755.  Having been ordained, he was Curate of Itchen Abbas from 1763 to 1792; and Rector of St Martin-by-Looe in Cornwall from 1785 to 1790.Powlett acted as a Steward at Hambledon, was \"the life and soul of the club for many years\" and \"when the end came, was the last to abandon the sinking ship\". He died in Marylebone, London.\nDespite being ordained and a Steward of the club and a member of the Laws of Cricket committee, Powlett was not above gambling on the outcome of matches or of betting against his own team.  In 1775, when Hambledon/Hampshire hosted Surrey on Broadhalfpenny Down, the match situation at one point of the Hampshire second innings was such that a Surrey victory seemed certain.  Powlett and his associate Philip Dehany, another Hambledon member, decided to bet heavily on Surrey to win.  But then John Small was joined at the wicket by his captain Richard Nyren and the two put on a massive century partnership which turned the game around.  Nyren was out for 98 and Small went on to make 136, which is the earliest known century in the history of first-class cricket.  Surrey then collapsed and Hampshire won a famous victory.  When Nyren was out, he was confronted by Powlett and Dehaney who complained that he and Small had cost them their money.  Nyren, disgusted with them, retorted: \"Another time, don't bet your money against such men as we are\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Laws of Cricket", "response": ["On Friday, 25 February 1774, the Laws were revised by a committee meeting at the Star and Garter.

At the end of that season, the Hambledon Club moved to Windmill Down, which is closer to the village. According to John Nyren, Windmill was \"one of the finest places for playing on I ever saw\".Underdown, p. 152. A key difference was that Windmill was under the club's control as they rented it from a farmer at ten guineas a year, whereas Broadhalfpenny was common land in use as sheep pasture, for fairs and other gatherings. It could be said that Broadhalfpenny belonged to the community and Windmill to the club, whose members may not have been happy about the \"raucous, boisterous crowds that gathered (on the Down)\". The move was done at the behest of the Duke of Dorset, chief among club members, and David Underdown saw it as the first step in a process which removed professional cricket from a truly rural setting and ultimately concentrated it in an urban environment, for it was Dorset's successors George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and Colonel Charles Lennox who were the key players in the establishment of the White Conduit Club in Islington and subsequently Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's.Underdown, p. 153."]}, {"page": "Richard Nyren", "response": ["Nyren made 4 known first-class appearances in 1775, but did not take part in one of the most famous matches in history.

As a result of Lumpy's protests, the middle stump was legalised, though its introduction was gradual.Haygarth, p. 21-22. However, Nyren did play against Surrey at Broadhalfpenny Down on 13 July and made his highest known score of 98, sharing a century partnership with Small for the 5th wicket and turning the match in Hampshire's favour. Small went on to make 136, the earliest definitely recorded century in the history of first-class cricket, and Hampshire eventually won by 296 runs having looked certain to lose before Nyren and Small came together.Haygarth, p. 25. When Nyren was out, he was confronted by Hambledon stewards Charles Powlett and Philip Dehaney who had bet heavily against Hampshire when the match looked lost. They remonstrated that they would lose their money because of Nyren and Small, but Nyren told them he was glad and said: \"Another time, don't bet your money against such men as we are\".Mote, p. 88.
