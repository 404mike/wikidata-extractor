He insists on not being Stanley's imaginary friend despite what his mother thinks. He considers himself to be Stanley's number one fan and in awe of his great ancestor. To Archie, visiting Stanley is like visiting a 'young Einstein' in the early years. But the reason he really wants to spend time with Stanley is because Archie is the first in his family not to carry the family brilliance that began with Stanley Brown. Thoughts and ideas bounce round Archie's head constantly, but he can only create problems, not solve them. Archie knows this, and believes that spending time with Stanley will teach him to be a 'proper' Brown, deserving of the family name. Only Stanley can see or hear Archie, as he uses OLIVIA, his super computer, to keep himself invisible to everyone else. Archie is shown as flamboyant, witty and energetic, with no social or personal inhibitions."]}]}}
