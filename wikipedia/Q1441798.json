While being sustained by commissions from Punch and The Telegraph magazines, Charteris wrote his first novel, A Share of the World, which was published in 1953. Francis Wyndham hailed it as \"the most impressive first novel that has appeared since the war\". Charteris went on to write eight further novels to great critical acclaim. His depiction of the aristocracy was often informed or based upon the lives of his relations. The family in his first novel was based upon his parents-in-law and he portrays Guy, his father, affectionately in many novels. Sir Oswald Mosley, who was related by marriage to his wife's family, launched but later abandoned a libel action over the tragic fascist portrayed in The River Watcher (1965). Charteris later developed a strong friendship with Mosley's son, Nicholas, 3rd Baron Ravensdale, who inspired a Congo mercenary in that same novel.", "\"Hugo Charteris was among the most gifted British novelists of the postwar generation and The Tide is Right (which was never published in his lifetime) is one of his best books. He wrote, in my opinion, more truthfully about the upper classes than any of his contemporaries. This study of family jealousy and dispossession in an old Scottish landowning family is as exciting as a thriller but its qualities are more than purely narrative. The people and the place are seen with an unmatched intensity and brought to life by a distinctive prose style of rare beauty and extraordinary expressive power.\"\u2014Francis Wyndham"]}, {"page": "Francis Wyndham", "response": ["Francis Wyndham may refer to:", "* Sir Francis Wyndham, 1st Baronet (c. 1612\u20131676), English soldier and politician", "* Francis Wyndham (judge) (died 1592), English politician", "* Francis Wyndham (writer) (1924\u20132017), English author, literary editor and journalist", "* Francis Wyndham (MP for Gloucester)"]}, {"page": "Wyndham (name)", "response": ["* Francis Wyndham (1924\u20132017), British author and journalist, son of Lt Col Guy Wyndham"]}, {"page": "David King (graphic designer)", "response": ["King was born in Isleworth, Middlesex, and studied typography at the London School of Printing.
