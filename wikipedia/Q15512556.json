During that same time, Deborah E. McDowell published New Directions for Black Feminist Criticism, which called for a more theoretical school of criticism versus the current writings, which she deemed overly practical. In this essay McDowell also extensively discussed black women's portrayal in literature, and how it came across as even more negative than white women's portrayal. As time moved forward, the theory began to disperse in ideology. Many decided to shift towards the nuanced psychological factors of the Black experience and further away from broad sweeping generalizations. Others began to connect their works to the politics of lesbianism. Some decided to analyze the Black experience through their relationship to the Western world. Regardless, these scholars continue to employ a variety of methods to explore the identity of Black feminism in literature."]}, {"page": "Hessell-Tiltman Prize", "response": ["*Hazel Carby, Imperial: A Tale of Two Islands"]}, {"page": "Black studies", "response": ["* Hazel Carby"]}, {"page": "Sula (novel)", "response": ["In her essay \"Boundaries: Or Distant Relations and Close Kin\", Deborah McDowell draws on the critical practices of Hortense Spillers and Hazel Carby and reads Sula from a poststructuralist perspective, urging black women critics to \"develop and practice [\u2026] critical approaches interactively, dialogically\" instead of viewing \"black female identity as unitary essence yielding an indigenous critical methodology.\"McDowell, Deborah E. \"Boundaries: Or Distant Relations and Close Kin\", in Houston A. Baker and Patricia Redmond (eds), Afro-American Literary Study in the 1990s, Chicago, London: University of Chicago Press, 1989. As she points out, the ambiguity of Sula as a character subverts traditional binary oppositions, and \"transcends the boundaries of social and linguistic convention.\" The decentering and temporal deferral of the character who lends the novel its title similarly \"denies the whole notion of character as static essence, replacing it with the idea of character as process.\" This \"complex set of dynamics\" forces the reader to \"fill in the gaps\" as well as to \"bridge the gaps separating [them] from the text\" and therefore makes them active participants in the meaning-making process."]}, {"page": "List of feminist literature", "response": ["*Reconstructing Womanhood, Hazel Carby (1987)"]}, {"page": "Materialist feminism", "response": ["Materialist feminism has been criticized for assuming universal oppression of women.

She instead noted the ways that values of the family are different for black women and men, just as the division of labor is also racialized."]}, {"page": "The Motion of Light in Water", "response": ["Hazel Carby called it one of two contemporary autobiographies that are \"absolutely central to any consideration of black manhood\" (the other being that of Miles Davis).

Race Men. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. p. 16. While the narratives of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Ann Jacobs move towards the North and freedom, Du Bois reverses \"the direction of the archetypal journey of these original narratives\" and focuses on the Black Belt of the South. Although the text \"consistently shifts between a predominantly white and a predominantly black world\", in line with Du Bois's concept of double consciousness, \"its overall narrative impulse gradually moves the focus from a white terrain to an autonomous black one.\"Carby, Race Men, 1998. p. 17."]}, {"page": "Paul Gilroy", "response": ["Gilroy is a scholar of cultural studies and black Atlantic diasporic culture with interests in the \"myriad manifestations of black British culture\".

Others feel African feminism became necessary in part due to white Western feminism's exclusion of the experiences of the black woman and the continental African woman. White Western feminisms does not take into account the particular issues black women face at the intersection of both their blackness and their womanhood. Currently, white feminism often classifies African women as \"women of color,\" which groups and thereby represses the African woman's historical trajectory and specific experience. Hazel Carby in \"White Women Listen! Black Feminism and the Boundaries of Sisterhood\" notes why white feminism is considered the normative experience of all women. She writes, \"History has constructed our sexuality and our femininity as deviating from those qualities with which white women, as the prize of the Western world, have been endowed.\" However, white feminism cannot continue to erase Africa or African women from feminist theory or feminist advocacy, because as the Mother Continent of humanity, the narratives and experiences of Africa's women will always be relevant."]}, {"page": "Hazel (given name)", "response": ["*Hazel Carby (b. 1948), professor of African American Studies and of American Studies"]}, {"page": "Sigmund H.
