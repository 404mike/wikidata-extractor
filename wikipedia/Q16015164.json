He was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire to an army officer and his wife. Ousby's father was stabbed to death in India in 1947 during the Partition, leaving his mother to raise him. He was educated at Bishop's Stortford College before matriculating to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he gained a double first in English and was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 1968 to study at Harvard University. While at Harvard, Ousby was awarded the Howard Mumford Jones Prize for the best doctoral thesis of the year. Following graduation, he became an academic, teaching English literature at Durham University and the University of Maryland. An \"intense dislike of organisations, as well as strong and divergent specialist interests\", resulted in him leaving the University of Maryland in 1983 to become a freelance writer.The subjects of his books ranged from detective fiction, with Bloodhounds of Heaven: The Detective in English Fiction from Godwin to Doyle to military history with The Road to Verdun and Occupation: the ordeal of France, 1940-1944, which was awarded the Edith McLeod Literary Prize and the Stern Silver PEN for Non-Fiction in 1998. His most noted work was as editor of The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English, which was first published in 1988 and republished in various forms in 1993, 1996 and 1998. After being diagnosed with cancer, he died on 6 August 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jean-Paul Sartre", "response": ["After coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the underground group Socialisme et Libert\u00e9 (\"Socialism and Liberty\") with other writers Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Toussaint Desanti, Dominique Desanti, Jean Kanapa, and \u00c9cole Normale students. In spring of 1941, Sartre suggested with \"cheerful ferocity\" at a meeting that the Socialisme et Libert\u00e9 assassinate prominent war collaborators like Marcel D\u00e9at, but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as \"none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades\". The British historian Ian Ousby observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans, noting it was French people like D\u00e9at that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France, General Otto von St\u00fclpnagel, and the popular slogan always was \"Death to Laval!\" rather than \"Death to Hitler!\". In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French Riviera seeking the support of Andr\u00e9 Gide and Andr\u00e9 Malraux. However, both Gide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre's disappointment and discouragement. Socialisme et libert\u00e9 soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote Being and Nothingness, The Flies, and No Exit, none of which were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines."]}, {"page": "Bloomsbury Group", "response": ["The Bloomsbury Group\u2014or Bloomsbury Set\u2014was a group of associated English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists in the first half of the 20th century,Fargis, p. 262 including Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster and Lytton Strachey. This loose collective of friends and relatives was closely associated with the University of Cambridge for the men and King's College London for the women, and they lived, worked or studied together near Bloomsbury, London. According to Ian Ousby, \"although its members denied being a group in any formal sense, they were united by an abiding belief in the importance of the arts.\"Ousby, p. 95 Their works and outlook deeply influenced literature, aesthetics, criticism, and economics as well as modern attitudes towards feminism, pacifism, and sexuality.

The experience of the Occupation was a deeply psychologically disorienting one for the French as what was once familiar and safe became strange and threatening. Many Parisians could not get over the shock experienced when they first saw the huge swastika flags hanging over the H\u00f4tel de Ville and on top of the Eiffel Tower. At the Palais-Bourbon, where the National Assembly building was converted into the office of the Kommandant von Gross-Paris, a huge banner was spread across the facade of the building reading in capital letters: \"DEUTSCHLAND SIEGT AN ALLEN FRONTEN!\" (\"Germany is victorious on all fronts!\"), a sign that is mentioned by virtually all accounts by Parisians at the time. The r\u00e9sistant Henri Frenay wrote seeing the tricolour flag disappear from Paris with the swastika flag flying in its place and German soldiers standing guard in front of buildings that once housed the institutions of the republic gave him \"un sentiment de viol\" (\"a feeling of rape\").

Targoff maintains that what distinguishes \"A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\" from Donne's other \"Valedictions\" is what Donne leaves for his lover: \"Donne does not leave his beloved either a physical or spiritual piece of himself. Instead, he leaves her the power of his poetic making. What is meant to prevent her \"mourning\" is not her possession of his name or book or heart or soul. It is the possession of his metaphors, metaphors of their union that seem invulnerable to division\". Guibbory uses \"A Valediction\" to highlight Donne's status as \"master of the monosyllable, the small word that holds the line taut\" with his use of the word \"beat\" rather than \"spun\" in the analogy of beaten gold, while Ian Ousby uses the compass metaphor as an example of Donne's skill at weaving conceits \"sometimes extended throughout an entire poem in a virtuoso display of similitude\".
