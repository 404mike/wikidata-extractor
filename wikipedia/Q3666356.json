A number of his portraits are in the Royal Collection. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1866 to 1893. In 1883 he was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters.\nBarber became a very popular sporting and animal painter, specialising particularly in sentimental portraits of dogs, often with children. His work ranged from photographically realistic to quick sketches. Although some have regarded his work as overly sentimental, his work remains popular, largely because of his competent painting.\nBarber received his final commission in 1894 to paint Queen Victoria, with her grandchildren, in her pony-carriage. He died in London soon afterwards. His place as foremost painter of children and pets was taken by Arthur Elsley.\nMany of Barber\u2019s paintings were made into prints, usually in the medium of photogravure. He exhibited at the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, Walker Art Gallery and  Manchester Art Gallery. Much of his art is at the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Yarmouth", "response": ["*Charles Burton Barber (1845\u20131894) painter, notably of children and petsArtCyclopedia website, Charles Burton Barber, \"English Painter, 1845\u20131894/93\".
