He quickly settled into the side, building a formidable attacking partnership with Arthur Dominy. He scored 19 goals in the Southern League in 1919\u201320. The \"Saints\" were then elected into the Football League, becoming founder members of the Third Division. He became the club's top scorer in 1920\u201321 with 22 goals, as Southampton were denied promotion despite finishing in second place. He hit 32 goals in 1921\u201322 to win himself attention at a national level, and to help his club win the Third Division South title. His intelligent play and deadly shooting earned him two England caps. He appeared against Wales and Scotland in the 1922 British Home Championship, achieving the rare distinction of being capped for England while playing for a third tier club."]}, {"page": "List of Gillingham F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Arthur Dominy"]}, {"page": "Jimmy McIntyre", "response": ["Saints were admitted into Division 3 of the Football League in 1920, and just missed out on promotion in their first season, but in 1922 McIntyre successfully guided Southampton into Division Two. Saints finished equal on points with Plymouth Argyle and took the title on goal average, helped in no small manner by 5\u20130 victories over Southend United and Newport County, a 6\u20130 defeat of Charlton Athletic and an 8\u20130 hammering of Northampton Town on 24 December 1921 (which is still Saints' biggest win in the Football League). In each of these matches Arthur Dominy scored twice, whilst Bill Rawlings scored three against Charlton and put four past Northampton, on his way to becoming top scorer for the season, contributing 30 of the team's 68 league goals. Saints total of only 21 goals conceded in a 42 match season was a Football League record which stood until 1979 and remains a record for Southampton. Goalkeeper Tommy Allen did not concede a goal in any of the final seven games of the season (five wins and two draws) and by the time the defence was finally breached by Leeds United on 28 August 1922 he had gone 845 minutes without conceding a goal."]}]}}
