Donald was Regius Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Glasgow. Donald's work was characterised by a series of collaborations between clinicians and engineers that led to the designing and building of a series of instruments that enabled the examination of the unborn and that eventually enabled him to build the world's first obstetric ultrasound machine, the Diasonograph in 1963. His other great achievement was to secure the construction of the Queen Mother's Maternity Hospital that was built next to the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow.", "link_mentions": {}}}
