He was previously Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1902 to 1905, and also a government minister under Lord Salisbury.\nDudley was the son of William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley, and succeeded to the earldom at the age of 17. He inherited a substantial fortune and the palatial family seat at Witley Court. Dudley sat with the Conservative Party in the House of Lords, and was Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade from 1895 to 1902. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland when Arthur Balfour came to power, and was regarded as a competent administrator. His time in Dublin led to his inclusion as a character in James Joyce's Ulysses.\nIn part due to the urging of King Edward VII, a longtime acquaintance, Dudley was appointed Governor-General of Australia in 1908. His extravagance and pomposity made him unpopular among the general public, and his attempts to interfere in political matters rankled both prime ministers he worked with (Andrew Fisher and Alfred Deakin). Deakin regarded him as doing \"nothing really important, nothing thoroughly, nothing consistently [...] very ineffective and not very popular\". He was recalled to England after less than three years in office.\nDudley took command of the Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars in 1913. He had first joined the army as a young man, and during the Second Boer War served with the Imperial Yeomanry. In World War I, Dudley commanded the Hussars for the initial stages of the Gallipoli campaign, but he returned to England before its conclusion. He was later attached to the headquarters staff of the 40th Division, and retired with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dudley had seven children with his first wife, and was succeeded in the earldom by his oldest son William.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Humble Ward", "response": ["* William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley (1867\u20131932), British aristocrat, politician and military officer"]}, {"page": "William Ward", "response": ["* William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley (1867\u20131932), British politician, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Governor-General of Australia"]}, {"page": "Rachel Ward", "response": ["Ward was born in Cornwell near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, the daughter of Claire Leonora (n\u00e9e Baring) and the Hon.
