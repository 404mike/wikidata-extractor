Windschuttle criticises the last 3 decades of historical scholarship which had challenged the traditional view of Aboriginal passivity in the face of European colonisation.Gregory D.B. Smithers, \"Reassuring 'White Australia': A Review of The Fabrication of Aboriginal History: Volume One\", in Journal of Social History,  Vol. 37, No. 2 (Winter, 2003), pp. 493\u2013505, p.493. His critique specifically challenges the prevailing consensus created by what he called the \"orthodox school\" of Australian frontier history concerning the violence between indigenous Australians and settlers, by examining the evidence for reported massacres in what is known as the \"Black War\" against the Aboriginal people of Tasmania. He refers to historians he defines as making up this \"orthodox school\" as being \"vain\" and \"self-indulgent\" for imposing their politics onto their scholarship,Keith Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803\u20131847, p. 402. and \"arrogant, patronizing and lazy\" for portraying the Tasmanian Aboriginal people's behavior and motivations in terms of European cultural concepts rather than taking the time to understand the cultural concepts of a hunter-gatherer society.Keith Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803\u20131847, p. 406. Windschuttle's \"orthodox school\" comprises a large number of historians and archaeologists, deceased or living, such as Henry Reynolds, Lyndall Ryan, Lloyd Robson, John Mulvaney, Rhys Jones, Brian Plomley, and Sharon Morgan, whom he regards as responsible for a politicised reading of the past, and for inflating the number of Aboriginal deaths.Gregory D.B. Smithers, \"Reassuring 'White Australia': A Review of The Fabrication of Aboriginal History\", p. 495. Reviewing their work, he highlights multiple examples of what he alleges are misrepresented sources,e.g. a colonial government report being cited as evidence of a massacre by a vigilante group when the report refers only to the movement of troops in response to Aboriginal attacks: Keith Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803\u20131847 Macleay Press, 2002, p. 142. inaccurate reportageAn Anglican minister's diary reported as recording 100 Aboriginal and 20 white deaths, was found to record 4 for the former, and 2 for the latter. Checking a source for Brian Plomley's reference to \"more killed\", Windschuttle found that the original actually had \"mare killed\". \u2014 Geoffrey Blainey, \"Native Fiction\", The New Criterion, Vol. 21, 2003, p. 79. or the citation of sources that do not exist.The Hobart Town Courier for 1826 is twice cited by one historian as providing the evidence for killings, but was not printed that year. \u2014 Geoffrey Blainey, \"Native Fiction\", The New Criterion, Vol. 21, 2003, p. 79.

It has more recently been called cultural burning and cool burning."]}, {"page": "Australian archaeology", "response": ["There is significant debate over the date of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the Australian continent. Until the 1950s it was often believed that arrival of the first Aboriginal people was within the last 10,000 years. In the 1950s, the dates were extended to the last Ice Age, based upon falling sea-levels at that period and the existence of landbridges linking the islands of the Sunda Shelf and the Sahul Continental Shelf with Australia, New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and Tasmania. The discovery and use of C14 dating extended the dating to 40,000 years at Lake Mungo, and this was the date most frequently given. However, more recently, the analysis of sea levels has shown that coastlines 40,000 years ago were not as exposed as they were 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. The submergence of the earliest sites of occupation due to rising sea levels has meant that the earliest archaeological signature may in fact represent occupation much later than the initial time of arrival.Hiscock, P. (2008). Archaeology of Ancient Australia, London; New York: Routledge The difficulty in establishing a date of arrival earlier than 50,000 years has been compounded by the widespread use of radiocarbon dating and the supposed \"radiocarbon barrier\" which establishes 40,000 years as a limit to which C14 dates can be easily and reliably extracted. This limitation has prompted many archaeologists, including Rhys Jones and Alan Thorne, to include thermoluminescence dating methods in their studies of early occupation sites. It is argued that 60,000 to 70,000 years best fits the evidence from the Human genome diversity project and a number of other new dating technologies. Some have proposed dates extending back 100,000 to 120,000 years, but these dates are criticised on technical grounds and are not accepted by most scientists. A recent study by Eske Willesev of the University of Copenhagen, of the genome of an Aboriginal man from the Western Australian Goldfields confirms that the Aboriginal population separated from the early human stock 70,000 years ago, in Africa or from Oman, and travelled fairly rapidly across south and south eastern Asia to arrive in Australia at least 50,000 years ago, before a second wave travelled into Europe and Asia, receiving some input from the Aboriginal people who had already made that journey.http://geogenetics.ku.dk/latest-news/aboriginals-get-new-history/  accessed 2/22016", "* Rhys Jones"]}, {"page": "List of Australian National University people", "response": ["*Rhys Jones, archaeologist"]}, {"page": "2001 in Wales", "response": ["*19 September - Rhys Jones, archaeologist, 60"]}, {"page": "Whitchurch High School", "response": ["* Prof Rhys Jones (b.
