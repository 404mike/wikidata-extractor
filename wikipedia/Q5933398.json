Knapp described  the species and illustrated it in a woodcut. He wrote: We have even an agaric, with a bulbous root and downy pileus, that will spring from the smooth summit of another (agaricus caseus), which has a uniform footstalk, though not of common occurrence. Thus a plant, that itself arises from decay, is found to constitute a soil for another; and the termination of this chain of efficiency is hidden from us. Seven years later, Miles Berkeley described the fungus as Agaricus loveianus, not aware of Knapp's previous publication, and wrote that it was \"a most elegant and curious species which ... appears not to have been hitherto noticed.\" Berkeley's name was frequently used in literature to refer to the fungus for over a century rather than Knapp. In his 1917 North American Flora, William Alphonso Murrill proposed a new name combination for the species based on Berkeley's name, Volvariopsis loweiana. In 1942, John Ramsbottom discovered Knapp's image and description of the fungus, and realizing it referred to the same species as Berkeley's Agaricus loveianus, made the new combination Volvaria surrecta. Rolf Singer transferred it to the genus Volvariella in 1951, giving it the name by which it is known presently."]}, {"page": "Knapp (surname)", "response": ["* John Leonard Knapp (1767\u20131845), English botanist"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (K\u2013L)", "response": ["* Knapp \u2013 John Leonard Knapp (1767\u20131845)"]}]}}
