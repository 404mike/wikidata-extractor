His best known prose works are Seren Tan Gwmmwl and Toriad y Dydd, political tracts addressed to the Welsh people which reflect the radical ideals of Thomas Paine and the author's Welsh patriotism.\nHis poetical output is more considerable and includes the poem entitled Cerdd Dic Si\u00f4n Dafydd (Dic Si\u00f4n Dafydd - Richard son of John son of David - is the name given to a Welshman who despises his language and who imitates the English. Dic Si\u00f4n Dafydd left Wales and became a draper in London; his pomposity led him to claim that he had forgotten how to speak Welsh, and on a visit to his mother in Wales who spoke only Welsh he insisted on speaking English). The poem lampoons those of the upwardly-mobile Welsh in London who turned their backs on their country and language in order to inveigle themselves to the English. It became one of the most familiar Welsh poems of the 19th century and is still appreciated today. The eponymous 'Dic Si\u00f4n Dafydd' has entered common usage as a derogatory term for any Welsh person of a similar nature, rather like \"Uncle Tom\" in relation to Afro-Americans.\nIn 1789 he moved to London and in 1793 became either the licensee or the manager of the \u2018Canterbury Arms\u2019 in Southwark. He was active in the London-based Gwyneddigion Society, and a founder member in 1794 or 1795 of the Cymreigyddion Society.\nOn the 23rd of July 1816, he married Jane Mondel of Whitehaven in Bermondsey parish church. He died aged 55 on the 21st of May 1821 and was buried in the little church of St Gregory, which is now part of St Paul's Cathedral.", "link_mentions": {}}}
