He was forced to surrender his boat in World War II after he had succeeded in rescuing her and her crew from the sea bed after she struck a mine. He was honourably acquitted at the inevitable court-martial after spending five years as a prisoner of war. \nAfter the war Lonsdale took Anglican holy orders, serving in several parishes. In 1952 he volunteered to go as a District Chaplain to Kenya, to help find a peaceful solution to the Mau Mau Uprising.", "link_mentions": {}}}
