The return from injury of Danny McGrain and shrewd signings such as winger Davie Provan and midfielder Murdo MacLeod helped McNeill strengthen a Celtic side that had finished fifth in the league previous season.  In May 1979 Celtic's final league fixture was an Old Firm fixture against Rangers at Parkhead.  A win would clinch the 1978\u201379 league title for Celtic, but any other result would leave Rangers as favourites for the league as they had two additional games to play.  Celtic attacked from the start but trailed 1\u20130 at half-time through an Alex MacDonald goal for Rangers.  Johnny Doyle was then sent-off in the second half, leaving Celtic a man down as well as a goal down.  Celtic though, responded in exhilarating style through goals from Roy Aitken and George McCluskey to go 2\u20131 ahead. Celtic's lead only lasted a couple of minutes, Bobby Russell equalising with a fine strike.  As the game neared the end, and with Celtic attacking relentlessly, a McCluskey cross was parried by Rangers goalkeeper Peter McCloy against one of his own defenders, Colin Jackson, and then rebounded back into the goal to put Celtic 3\u20132 ahead.  In the final minute Murdo MacLeod put the matter beyond doubt when he hammered home a powerful 20 yard strike to secure a 4\u20132 win on the night and clinch the title in the most dramatic of circumstances.", "thumb|left|Billy McNeill in September 1982The following season Celtic reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup.

Two weeks later at the Bernabeu Stadium, Celtic were beaten 3\u20130 and went out on aggregate.  That season, Celtic held an eight-point lead in the league at one stage, but a strong emerging Aberdeen side caught up on them and pipped them to the title.  Celtic did win the Scottish Cup, a George McCluskey goal giving Celtic a 1\u20130 win after extra-time in a tight encounter with Rangers in May 1980.  The aftermath of the game however is now notorious for the riot that took place between the rival fans that day.  Crowds of Celtic fans raced onto the pitch to celebrate at full-time.  A section of Rangers fans quickly invaded the pitch in response and confronted the Celtic fans.
