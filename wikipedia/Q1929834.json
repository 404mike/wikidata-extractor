In the 1950s, Dorman-Smith (then, Dorman O\u2019Gowan) became an officer in the Irish Republican Army (IRA).\nIn the 1920s, during the interwar period, he was one of the military thinkers in various countries, like Heinz Guderian in Germany and Charles de Gaulle in France, who realised that technology and motorisation were changing the way that wars and battles were fought. Influenced by J. F. C. Fuller, Archibald Wavell, B. H. Liddell Hart, and many others, Dorman-Smith tried to change the culture of the British Army and held a number of teaching and training roles in various parts of the British Empire. Although he made several contributions in advisory roles during the campaigns in the Western Desert from 1940 to 1941, it was not until May 1942 that he went on active service again. His service in the Second World War is shrouded in controversy and ended when he was fired from his command in August 1944.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard O'Connor", "response": ["In early January 1941, the Western Desert Force was redesignated XIII Corps.

Templer's instructors there included Bernard Paget, Henry Pownall and Bernard Montgomery.

When Montgomery assumed command of Eighth Army in August 1942 he became Montgomery's chief of staff. He was promoted acting major-general in May 1943. De Guingand proved indispensable to Montgomery, not only in battle, but also in relations with the Americans.  De Guingand seems to have been blessed with considerable diplomatic skills, which proved useful when serving with Montgomery. He formed a close relationship with Walter Bedell Smith, the chief of staff to Supreme Allied Commander, General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower, and was able to smooth over many difficulties arising from Montgomery's problematic relationships with many of his peers and superiors.", "De Guingand asked to be returned to his regiment, and this was done.
