Until his death, he worked for Pimlico Plumbers, a plumbing company in southeast London, as a van cleaner, and refused to take a day off on the day he celebrated what he claimed was his 100th birthday. He also received coverage in the media for fending off an attack from a group of youths in 2007; he was cited by the former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell as \"living proof of why people should not be written off once they pass retirement age\". Martin stated that he would not retire from working.Doubts have been raised about all of Martin's historical claims, including his age, which may have in truth been 97 at the time of his death.", "link_mentions": {}}}
