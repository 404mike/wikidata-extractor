They acted as Australian agent for Mark Lane Express, which they sold at the London cover price. Business dropped off however as local manufacture of such equipment boomed, compounded by some unsuccessful speculation in mining ventures, and was forced to close his machinery business, which ceased trading in 1873. He took up management of the City Arms Hotel on King William Street in July 1875.He was elected to the Legislative Council on 1 March 1865, retiring on 2 February 1873, though he was never a prominent figure in Parliament or politics.He was for many years a committee member of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society.\nHe was an active Freemason.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
