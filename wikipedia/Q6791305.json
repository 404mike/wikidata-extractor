He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler who played first-class cricket for Derbyshire in 1994.\nTaylor represented Derbyshire in four matches during the 1994 season, and though it looked like he would benefit from the release of Richard Sladdin during 1994, Taylor found himself relegated to the second team, where he would find team-mates Andy Cottam and Tom Harrison ahead of him in the batting lineup.\nTaylor was released at the end of 1995, and would not play competitive cricket again until 2000, when he represented Lancashire CB in the 2000 Natwest Trophy, and played many games in 2001 for the Lancashire second team, though he was not to receive a first-team contract and did not play any first-class or List A games for Lancashire.\nDuring 1994, when Taylor played in a match against Middlesex, he was made a part of cricketing history as Richard Johnson's tenth victim of ten in a single innings, giving the Middlesex man the best single-innings bowling figures of his career, and the third-best single-innings bowling analysis in Middlesex's history.\nTaylor's younger sister Jennifer Taylor represented the GB volleyball team in the 2012 London Olympics'. Taylor moved into teaching and serves as Head teacher at Lever Park Academy in Bolton (2017).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matthew Taylor", "response": ["* Matthew Taylor (bassist), member of the band Motion City Soundtrack", "* Matthew Taylor (composer) (born 1964), English composer", "* Matthew Taylor (musician) (born 1968), American musician, member of the band Bellini", "* Maddie Taylor (born 1966), American voice actress, formerly known as Matthew Taylor", "* Matthew Taylor (sculptor) (1837\u20131889), English sculptor", "* Matthew Taylor (footballer) (born 1981), English footballer", "* Matthew Taylor (cricketer, born 1973), English cricketer", "* Matthew Taylor (cricketer, born 1994), English cricketer", "*Matthew Taylor (cricketer, born 1999)", "* Matthew Taylor (political strategist) (born 1960), formerly adviser to Tony Blair and director of the IPPR", "* Matthew Taylor, Baron Taylor of Goss Moor (born 1963), Cornish former Liberal Democrat MP", "* Matthew Taylor (architect) (born 1975), architect and campaigner", "* Matthew Taylor (blogger), author of Techmoan YouTube channel"]}, {"page": "List of Lancashire Cricket Board List A players", "response": ["*Matthew Taylor (2000): M Taylor"]}]}}
