Now, however, there was little attempt to unify the artists's contributions beyond Lewis's belief that 'the experiments [by artists] undertaken all over Europe during the last ten years should .... not be lightly abandoned.'Wyndham Lewis, 'Introduction', in  Group X exhibition catalogue, 1920. The diversity of styles on display, for example, included four self-portraits by Lewis, while Roberts exhibited four quite radical works in his evolving 'Cubist' style.Athletes Exercising in a Gymnasium, The Wedding, The Auction Room and The Cockneys \u2013 see 'William Roberts: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9' available at http://www.englishcubist.co.uk/catchron.html.

They hate each other.\" Cook and Brown focused on their common political ground, discussing how to firmly entrench progressive politics after the exit of Tony Blair. Chris Smith said in 2005 that in recent years Cook had been setting out a vision of \"libertarian, democratic socialism that was beginning to break the sometimes sterile boundaries of 'old' and 'New' Labour labels\".

Skinner said that Livingstone had betrayed Labour Party activists in his Brent East constituency, whom he described as having fought for him \"like tigers\" when his majority had been small: \"He tells them he's going to be the Labour candidate, then he lies to them.
