He paints obsessively and prolifically. He stars in the documentary My Name Is Alan and I Paint Pictures, which covers six years of his life and focuses on the relationship between his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and his struggle to find success in the art world.\n\nHe specializes in stylized landscapes of New York City, San Francisco, and other US cities along with his native England.
