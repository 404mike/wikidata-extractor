Meanwhile, Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) uses hypnosis on both Worf and Crusher, finding that both recall being invaded by some entity during their blackouts.

In this episode he played a security ensign, as it was not until season two that he began to play the recurring character of Miles O'Brien, who would later become a series regular on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Another Deep Space Nine actor who made his first Trek appearance in this episode was Marc Alaimo, who played an Antican who was unnamed on screen, but referred to in the script as Badar N'D'D. Alaimo went on to play several other roles in The Next Generation including as the Cardassian Gul Macet in \"The Wounded\", before being cast as Gul Dukat in DS9. John Durbin appeared as the Selay leader, and would also go on to appear as a Cardassian later in the series, as Gul Lemec in \"Chain of Command\".
