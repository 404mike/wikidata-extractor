Asquith", "response": ["As one example, Gilmour, Curzon's biographer, writes that the Unionist ministers \"did not, as Beaverbrook alleged, decide to resign themselves in order to strengthen the Prime Minister's hand against Lloyd George..(their intentions) were completely different.\" Similarly, Adams, Law's latest biographer, describes Aitken's interpretation of the resolution as \"convincingly overturned\". John Ramsden is equally clear: \"the Unionist ministers acted to strengthen Lloyd George's hand, from a conviction that only greater power for Lloyd George could put enough drive into the war effort.\"", "On 7 May 1918 a letter from a serving officer, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice appeared in four London newspapers, accusing Lloyd George and Law of having misled the House of Commons in debates the previous month as to the manpower strength of the army in France. Asquith, who received a letter from Maurice on 6 May, and had also been in contact with the sacked Robertson, with whom Maurice discussed the letter, called for a Select Committee of the House to investigate the charges. In response to a private notice question, Law had offered a judicial inquiry, with Asquith free to choose the judges, but Asquith declined this offer on the evening of 7 May, thinking it contrary to the dignity of Parliament. Prior to the debate, he received a surprising communication (8 May) from H. A. Gwynne, the editor of The Morning Post, and previously a fervent opponent. \"The effect of the Maurice letter, and your motion, must be the dissolution of the present government (and) your accession to power.\" At this point \"Asquith hated Lloyd George with a passion\" but he did not want the premiership for himself.  Asquith's opening speech on the Select Committee motion was lengthy and lacked punch. Bridgeman recorded, \"He did not make much of a case, and did not even condemn Maurice's breach of the King's Regulations, for which he got a very heavy blow from L.G.\". Lloyd George's one and a quarter-hour long reply was \"a stunning solo display by the greatest rhetorician of his age\" in which he threatened the House with the inevitable political consequence of a vote for Asquith's motion. \"... if this motion is carried, he [Asquith] will again be responsible for the conduct of the War. Make no mistake!\" John Ramsden summed up the opinion in the House of Commons: \"Lloyd George's lies were (preferred to) Asquith's half-measures.\" The motion was defeated by 293 votes to 106, more an \"utter rejection of Asquith, than (a) wholehearted endorsement of Lloyd George\", and the latter's position in Parliament was not seriously threatened for the remainder of the War."]}, {"page": "Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham", "response": ["Hailsham was not offered a seat in the small emergency Cabinet of the National Government of August\u2013October 1931, a fact which John Ramsden attributes to his disloyalty to Baldwin in opposition. Hailsham's previous job was not available, as the Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Sankey had joined the National Government; Hailsham was therefore offered, and refused, the sinecure post of Lord Privy Seal. After the October 1931 elections, with the Cabinet restored to a larger size, he joined the second National Government as Secretary of State for War and Leader of the House of Lords.", "John Ramsden suggests that rapid success, coming to a man who entered politics at the late age of fifty, made him \"overplay his hand\" in the events of 1929\u201331, even though as a peer by then he could not reasonably hope to be Prime Minister. William Bridgeman recorded in his diary that Hogg's success had not impaired \"his great ability in debate, though it did I think interfere with his political judgement \u2026 He never suffered a reverse until the defeat of the party in 1929, an experience which would have been beneficial if he had had it.\""]}, {"page": "Stafford Cripps", "response": ["During World War II, he served as Ambassador to the USSR (1940\u201342), during which time he grew wary of the Soviet Union, but achieved great public popularity because on being invaded by Nazi Germany the USSR stated its co-operation with the Allies and restoring peace, causing Cripps to be seen in 1942 as a potential rival to Winston Churchill for the premiership. He became a member of the War Cabinet of the wartime coalition, but failed in his efforts (the \"Cripps Mission\") to resolve the wartime crisis in India, where his proposals were too radical for Churchill and the Cabinet, and too conservative for Mahatma Gandhi and other Indian leaders. He later served as Minister of Aircraft Production, an important post but outside the inner War Cabinet.Mitchell, Andrew (2002) \"Cripps, (Richard) Stafford\" in John Ramsden, ed., The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics. . p. 176"]}, {"page": "The Germans", "response": ["* This episode popularised the phrase \"Don't mention the war\".

Formulated in this way, Churchill's mental health history contains unmistakable echoes of the seminal interpretation of Lord Moran's Black Dog revelations made in an essay by Dr Joseph Storr.A. Storr, \"The Man\", in A. J. P. Taylor et al., Churchill: Four Faces and the Man (Penguin, 1973). In drawing so heavily on Moran for what he took to be the latter's totally reliable, first-hand clinical evidence of Churchill's lifelong struggle with \"prolonged and recurrent depression\" and its associated \"despair\", Storr produced a seemingly authoritative and persuasive diagnostic essay that, in the words of John Ramsden, \"strongly influenced all later accounts\".J.
