His regular position was as a forward. He was born in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire. He played for Bulwell, Ilkeston Town, Derby County, Bristol City, Manchester United, Heart of Midlothian, Brighton & Hove Albion, Blackburn Rovers and Ilkeston United. The highlight of his career came at Brighton when he scored the winning goal in a famous giant killing of Preston North End in 1908.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Peddie", "response": ["After five seasons at Newcastle, Peddie moved to Manchester United in June 1902 and led the club's scoring charts in his first season with 11 league goals (15 in all competitions). Despite this, he left for Plymouth Argyle in May 1903 ahead of their first season as a professional club. He scored their first competitive goals in both the Southern League and Western League, and scored 21 goals from 46 appearances in his one year at Home Park.\"Jack Peddie profile\". Greens on Screen. Retrieved 23 August 2010. He returned to Manchester United in 1904, and as well as being named club captain, he was again the club's top goalscorer with 17 goals in 32 league appearances. The arrival of high-scoring Jack Picken in May 1905 meant Peddie was unable to repeat the feat for a third time in four seasons, although he still made an important contribution with 20 goals in all competitions as Manchester United finished in second place to win promotion back to the First Division for the first time since 1894. Peddie was also replaced as captain by Charlie Roberts prior to the 1905\u201306 season. Having played in the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots international trial match twice while playing for Third Lanark and twice with Newcastle, he made his fifth appearance in the fixture as a Manchester United player in March 1906, but would never be selected for the Scottish national team. In January 1907, he returned to Scotland, signing for Heart of Midlothian in a triple transfer with Dick Wombwell and William Yates. In total across his two spells with Manchester United, Peddie scored 58 goals in 121 appearances."]}, {"page": "1902 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The replay was arranged for Thursday, 20 March at Molineux in Wolverhampton and this also ended 1\u20131, watched by 13,284.

He worked on his physical conditioning at his new club, and became a regular at outside right in the first team with 13 goals from 119 appearances in all competitions over two-and-a-half years. Described by club historian Tim Carder as \"a tricky little ball-player, noted for the accuracy of his crosses with either foot\", he attracted attention from bigger clubs. After Brighton eliminated First Division Preston North End from the 1907\u201308 FA Cup after two replays, Blackburn Rovers were convinced to sign Anthony and two teammates, Dick Wombwell and Joe Lumley, for \"a substantial sum\", widely reported as \u00a3750. The Football Association had recently imposed a rule forbidding more than \u00a3350 to be paid for any single player, and it was understood that Anthony was the primary target and Lumley and Wombwell were makeweights in the circumvention of that maximum."]}]}}
