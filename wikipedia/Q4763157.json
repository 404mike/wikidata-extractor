According to the 19th-century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd, the first church in Llanynghenedl was erected in about 620. A new church was erected in 1862, replacing a building that the 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones noted as dating in part from the late 13th or early 14th century, based on the decorations on the south doorway. The church later fell into disuse as a result of the growth of the nearby village of Valley and the church there.  In 1988, St Enghenedl's was dismantled and re-erected as an extension to St Mihangel's, Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn, so that St Mihangel's could serve as the church for RAF Valley.

By the time she was writing, the church was attached to the parish of St Machraeth's Church, Llanfachraeth. St Enghenedl's was rebuilt in 1862 by Henry Kennedy, the architect of the Diocese of Bangor. Another church was subsequently built in the parish, in the village of Valley.  As Valley grew, St Enghenedl's declined in use and it eventually closed. It was dismantled in 1988 and rebuilt as an extension to St Mihangel's Church, Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn, so that it could serve as the church for RAF Valley. St Enghenedl's was re-erected with its west end adjoining the west end of St Mihangel's, which had also been built by Kennedy in 1862.  The old east window of St Enghenedl's now faces west, and the bellcote is in the middle of the roof.  The churchyard, gravestones, and lychgate of St Enghenedl's remain in their original location, but the churchyard is now overgrown.", "Angharad Llwyd described the church in 1833 as \"a lofty but small edifice\", adding that several parts \"display marks of very great antiquity.\" Harry Longueville Jones said that its size made it \"one of the least considerable\" of the churches in Anglesey. The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in July 1873.  He said that it was a small church with \"some small rude (rood)windows\"."]}, {"page": "St Mihangel's Church, Llanfihangel yn Nhowyn", "response": ["The date of the first church on this site is unknown; writing in 1833, the antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church then on the site as \"an ancient and venerable structure\" that formed \"a conspicuous and interesting object for many miles round.\" St Mihangel's was largely rebuilt in 1862 by Henry Kennedy, architect of the Diocese of Bangor; some of the earlier building, especially the east end, was reused in Kennedy's church. St Enghenedl's Church, Llanynghenedl (a disused Anglesey church) was dismantled and \"faithfully reassembled\" at the west end of St Mihangel's in 1988, to allow the building to serve as the chapel for RAF Valley, a nearby Royal Air Force base.
