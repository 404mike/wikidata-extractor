A travelling scholarship from Lady Margaret Hall in 1923 allowed her to conduct research in Paris. It was at this time that she met her life-long friend, Maude Clarke."]}, {"page": "A. E.

On the first point, Gwilym Dodd has described the parliament as a landmark event in the institution's history, and, say Richardson and Sayles, it began a fifty-year period of developing and honing procedure. The assembly also, suggests G. L. Harriss, marks a point in the history of the English monarchy in which its authority was curtailed to a similar degree to the limitation previously imposed on King John by the Magna Carta and Henry III by de Montfort. Maddicott agrees with Richardson and Sayles regarding the significance of 1327 for the development of separate chambers, because it \"saw the presentation of the first full set of commons' petitions [and] the first comprehensive statute to derive from such petitions\". Maude Clarke described its significance as being in how \"feudal defiance\" was for the first time subsumed to the \"will of the commonality, and the King was rejected not by his vassals but by his subjects\"."]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Maude Clarke, first female to join Queen's University Belfast\u2019s academic staff", "*Maude Clarke (1892\u20131935), Irish historian; first female to join Queen's University Belfast\u2019s academic staff"]}, {"page": "Maude Violet Clarke", "response": ["#REDIRECT Maude Clarke"]}, {"page": "List of women writers (A\u2013L)", "response": ["*Maude Clarke (1892\u20131935, Northern Ireland/England), historian"]}]}}
