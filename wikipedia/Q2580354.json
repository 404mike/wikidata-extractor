Darwin was elected a member of the Plinian on 28 November 1826, along with another student of his own age, William Rathbone Greg, who immediately announced plans for a talk showing that \"the lower animals possess every faculty & propensity of the human mind.\" Greg would later become a noted writer on Victorian social problems, including prostitution, and on female sexual desire. On 5 December Darwin was elected to the Society's council. At the same meeting Browne presented an attack on Bell's claims that the Creator had endowed humans with unique muscles lacking in animals to express emotions showing mankind's superior moral nature, and denied that there was any essential difference. Darwin went on to attend eighteen of nineteen meetings that he could have attended during that academic year, and became a zealous assistant to Grant, learning to collect and dissect seashore creatures."]}, {"page": "William Greg", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Rathbone Greg"]}, {"page": "Adam Hodgson", "response": ["He was the son of Thomas Hodgson, a Liverpool merchant, and his wife Elizabeth Lightbody (1758\u20131795).David Sekers, (ed.)
