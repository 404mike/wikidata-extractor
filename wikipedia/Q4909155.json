In 1977 the Stars finished second in the Northern Division, qualifying for the playoffs, where they lost in the first round to Rochester at Busch Memorial Stadium. Key players for the 1977 Stars team were DF Ray Evans (NASL second-team all-star) and MF Al Trost (NASL honorable mention)."]}, {"page": "John Jackson (footballer, born 1942)", "response": ["Jackson was born in Hammersmith and began his career as a junior with Crystal Palace, signing from St Clement Danes School in March 1962. He also spent time with Brentford as a junior. He was initially understudy to Bill Glazier but when Glazier left in 1964, vied successfully for the goalkeeping position with Tony Millington. He then went on to make  222 consecutive appearances and was ever present in the 1968\u201369 season which saw Palace reach the top flight for the first time. In the club's subsequent four seasons in the top division Jackson missed only four games. After Palace were relegated in 1973, he moved to Leyton Orient, where he stayed for six years. After that, two years at Millwall was followed by a year with Ipswich, and Jackson finished his career with Hereford United, after 19 years as a goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["The next season, 1963\u201364, Coventry finally achieved promotion back to Division Two. The star of the team was Hudson, who scored twenty-one goals before Christmas, and City were nine points clear at the top of the table by January. They then suffered a reversal of fortune, going eleven games without victory, and by February the lead was down to just one point. Hill made some changes, including the emergency signing of George Kirby as a controversial replacement for the temporarily-out-of-form Hudson. City appeared to have missed out on promotion when they lost 2\u20130 at Peterborough in April, but they were saved by some poor results for their rivals and a winner by the returning Hudson in a final-day victory over Colchester, giving them the championship. The club's first two seasons back in the second tier resembled the pre-war seasons of 1936\u201337 and 1937\u201338: in 1964\u201365 they started very well, briefly going top of the table after five games, but eventually finishing with a solid mid-table finish. Then, in 1964\u201365, followed a genuine promotion challenge as Coventry missed out by a point. Hill courted controversy once more by selling George Hudson during the season to Northampton for \u00a329,000. New signings during this time included goalkeeper Bill Glazier and striker Ian Gibson, while local player and future manager, Bobby Gould, began to appear regularly in the side."]}]}}
