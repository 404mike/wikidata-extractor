He is particularly known for his view that the current Internet culture and the Web 2.0 trend may be debasing culture, an opinion he shares with Jaron Lanier and Nicholas G. Carr among others. Keen is especially concerned about the way that the current Internet culture undermines the authority of learned experts and the work of professionals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Internet", "response": ["Author Andrew Keen, a long-time critic of the social transformations caused by the Internet, has focused on the economic effects of consolidation from Internet businesses.

Similarly, the 700-employee room rental start-up Airbnb was valued at $10\u00a0billion in 2014, about half as much as Hilton Worldwide, which employs 152,000 people.

He has been cited and quoted in the media regarding these activities, especially with respect to his editing in the area of climate change. He was cited by Nature magazine, in their December 2005 review of the reliability of Wikipedia, as an example of an expert who edits Wikipedia. Nature quoted Connolley, in 2006, as saying that \"some scientists have become frustrated with Wikipedia\" but that \"conflict can sometimes result in better articles\". In July 2006, a New Yorker article described him as briefly becoming \"a victim of an edit war over the entry on global warming\", in which a sceptic repeatedly \"watered down\" the article's explanation of the greenhouse effect. Connolley told the magazine that Wikipedia \"gives no privilege to those who know what they're talking about\". Various books have cited Connolley as an example of how expert editors on Wikipedia are given \"no more credence\" than anonymous editors of the site.Rosen, Larry D., Mark Carrier and Nancy A.

Keen's 2007 book, Cult of the Amateur, argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, Sunday Times reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as \"creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels... [and that Wikipedia is full of] mistakes, half-truths and misunderstandings\".
