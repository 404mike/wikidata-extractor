He was born in Clifton, now part of Bristol.\nMerrick's peers included Artur Schnabel and Mark Hambourg, and he studied with Theodor Leschetizky. From 1911 to 1929 he taught at the Royal Manchester College of Music and from 1929 at the Royal College of Music. His students included Alan Rawsthorne and Thomas Pitfield He went to Vienna in 1899 for about 18 months and again, for a shorter period, in 1903.  This prevented him from playing at the Bechstein (now Wigmore) Hall when it first opened.  ([1]). He is particularly known for winning in 1928 the Columbia Gramophone Company competition to write the remaining movements (scherzo and finale) of Schubert's 8th Symphony. His composition was recorded by Columbia and sold, although these recordings are primarily, if not all, on 12-inch records and now very rare. Several later LP recordings of Frank Merrick playing various works by John Field and other British composers were released on the British label Rare Recorded Editions and are also rare. A \"Frank Merrick Society\" was formed to release his recordings. His book, Practising the Piano, first published by Barrie and Jenkins in 1960, has gone through at least four printings. His many pupils include the composer Michael Garrett and the pianist and teacher Stephen Gosney.\nThe original manuscripts of his compositions were donated to CHOMBEC (Centre for the History of Music in Britain, the Empire and the Commonwealth) and the archives of Bristol University.  There are many items, including a large number of Esperanto songs, over 30 of which, by his own account, he composed.\nDuring the First World War he was imprisoned as a conscientious objector, and learned Esperanto with the help of fellow-prisoner Henry Montagu Butler. He dedicated much time to the language and spoke it well; in 1965 he made a recording of some of the Esperanto songs with the well-known mezzo-soprano Sybil Michelow.\nHe spent many hours at the British Museum copying by hand the works of John Field, who at that time was little known; the result was his edition of Field's piano concertos which became vol. 17 of Musica Britannica.\nHe made several recordings of the music of Sir Arnold Bax, including the composer's first violin sonata (reissued on compact disc in 2003) and the four piano sonatas. Bax's P\u00e6an for piano is dedicated to him.\n([2]). With Michael Round he made a recording of the Sonata for two pianos and other works by Bax.\nLate in his life he was awarded MMus by Bristol University, when they first introduced the degree. Around 1967 he returned to the Victoria Rooms, Clifton, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of his first public recital, as a child, largely reprising the programme he had played at his d\u00e9but. Even later, in 1976, he visited the London Esperanto Club to be interviewed, in Esperanto, on the occasion of his 90th birthday.  He was appointed a CBE in the 1978 New Year Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1981 in music", "response": ["**Frank Merrick, pianist"]}, {"page": "1886 in music", "response": ["*April 30 \u2013 Frank Merrick, British pianist and composer (d. 1981)"]}, {"page": "Theodor Leschetizky", "response": ["His most important legacy is as the main teacher of numerous great pianists such as Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Aline van Barentzen, Ernesto B\u00e9rumen, Alexander Brailowsky, Ignaz Friedman, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Florence Parr Gere, Katherine Goodson, Mark Hambourg, Helen Hopekirk, Mieczyslaw Horszowski, Edwin Hughes, Frank La Forge, Mabel Lander, Ethel Leginska, Frank Merrick, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Elly Ney, Marie Novello, John Powell, Auguste de Radwan, Zudie Harris Reinecke, Artur Schnabel, Richard Singer, J\u00f3zef \u015aliwi\u0144ski,  Bertha Tapper, Isabelle Vengerova, Maria Wilhelmj, Paul Wittgenstein, Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler and many others."]}, {"page": "Alan Rawsthorne", "response": ["In 1925, Rawsthorne was finally able to enrol at the Royal Manchester College of Music , where his teachers included Frank Merrick for the piano and Carl Fuchs for the cello.

In the 'English' zone, for example, the first prize of \u00a3150 was divided between the composer-pianist Frank Merrick (who submitted a completion of the Schubert symphony) and John St. Anthony Johnson, for a symphonic movement called Pax Vobiscum.  The second prize went to the composer Havergal Brian for the orchestral movements from his Gothic Symphony. (This symphony, which had evolved between 1919 and 1927, is famous for the gigantic orchestra and chorus employed in the choral finale that forms Part Two. It had clearly not been written as an entry for the competition, but as submitted by the composer, only the somewhat smaller manuscript for Part One, consisting of three more conventional orchestral movements, was deemed eligible to be adjudged as a stand-alone work.) In the Austrian section, the first prize was awarded to Franz Schmidt for his Third Symphony, the second to Hans G\u00e1l for his First Symphony and the third prize to a symphony by Moni Friedsohn. In the Scandinavian section, the first prize went to Kurt Atterberg of Sweden for his Sixth Symphony, the second to the Norwegian, Ludvig Irgens-Jensen, for his orchestral Passacaglia, and the third prize to a symphony by the Dane Jens Laursen Emborg.", "From 19 to 23 June 1928 the 30 winning scores from the ten national zones were evaluated in Vienna by the International jury. This body consisted of one delegate from each of the zones plus an eleventh juror appointed in Vienna.

The Polish delegate was Emil M\u0142ynarski; the eleventh, Viennese, delegate was Guido Adler. Since the deliberations of the jury were never published, they have been the subject of much rumour. It was agreed that all the completions of Schubert's Unfinished should be ruled out and the judging devoted only to the original works. The sole international prize was awarded to the Sixth Symphony of Kurt Atterberg. Vasily Kalafati received a second place acknowledgment for his work Legende, Op. 20.
