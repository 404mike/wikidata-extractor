However, Austerberry failed to arrive for the meeting and Raisbeck later met Liverpool manager Tom Watson at the home of the Hibernian chairman. Watson quickly made him an offer to join Liverpool and the transfer was completed on 6 May 1898. He was welcomed to the club with a Lancashire hotpot dinner, a tradition for Liverpool to initiate new players. One of several Scottish players in the squad, Raisbeck commented that he was \"welcomed with open arms\" and \"felt at home right away\" and became particularly good friends with fellow Scot John Walker."]}, {"page": "Peter Durber", "response": ["Durber was born in Stoke-upon-Trent and played for Audley Town before joining Stoke in 1896.

He \"did not put a foot wrong\" in his first seasons at the club, before establishing himself as the centre of Stoke's half-back line between James Bradley and George Baddeley following Alf Wood's departure in March 1901. For the next ten seasons Holford was a near ever-present in the Stoke team, racking up 105 consecutive appearances from March 1903 to March 1906. His good performances won him an England cap in 1903 and he is considered the smallest centre-back ever to play for England at just 5\u00a0ft 5. During Holford's time at the club he played the game in a fiery style, although he was never sent off. He succeeded George Baddeley as captain in 1905. Holford's manager Horace Austerberry described him as \"an excellent passer of the ball and one who played every match as if it was his last\". In 1908 Stoke went bust and dropped out of the English Football League and played in the Birmingham League. Holford was too good to be lost to non-league football and so he had to leave his home-town club, who he played nearly 270 games for.Matthews, Tony: \"The Encyclopedia of Stoke City \" (Lion Press, 1994, )"]}, {"page": "Billy Eardley", "response": ["In August 1896, he moved on to Stoke. At Stoke, Eardley played ten matches under Horace Austerberry during the 1896\u201397 season, scoring once in a 2\u20131 victory against Preston North End at the Victoria Ground on 9 November 1896, and was released in January 1897."]}, {"page": "Alf Wood (footballer, born 1876)", "response": ["However, he signed for Southampton St Mary's in the summer of 1895. Port Vale lodged a complaint with The Football Association about \"poaching\", claiming that the contract was signed before the League season had ended. An emergency FA meeting was held at Sheffield, resulting in the \"Saints\" being severely censured for negligence. St Mary's were ordered to pay their own costs, plus \u00a31 13s to Port Vale. The Southampton director, Alfred McMinn was suspended for a year and trainer Bill Dawson for a month; Wood's registration with St Mary's was cancelled. Wood never played for Port Vale again either, and instead returned to the Potteries and signed for Stoke in October 1895. He made an instant impact, scoring on his debut against Derby County at the Baseball Ground. He slowly established himself in Horace Austerberry's squad and was involved in controversial scenes at the end of the 1897\u201398 season. Stoke had a poor campaign and finished bottom of the First Division, meaning they had to play a test match series against Newcastle United and Burnley. In the final match against Burnley, both teams went into the match knowing that a draw would see them remain in the First Division and throughout the 90 minutes not a single attempt on goal was made, this led to the introduction of automatic promotion and relegation. The following season saw an improvement, as Stoke reached the semi-final of the FA Cup for the first time, losing out 3\u20131 to Derby County. Wood spent two more seasons at the Victoria Ground, before joining Aston Villa in March 1901."]}]}}
