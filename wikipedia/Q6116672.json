This is Derby's only FA Cup triumph. Stamps came close to scoring in regular time but the ball burst as he shot, making it easier to save. Stamps was famous for his powerful shot and is a cult figure in Derby County history, with the club's annual Player of the Year award being named after him.\nIn 1942\u201343, Stamps made 14 guest appearances for Southampton, scoring 11 goals.He played for Burton Albion FC in the 1954\u20131955 season, signed by manager Reg Weston.

In the next minute Turner scored for his own side when he took a free-kick from the edge of the Rams' penalty area, and although goalkeeper Vic Woodley appeared to have the shot well covered, the ball struck a Derby player and was deflected past Woodley into the opposite corner of the net to which he was diving."]}, {"page": "History of Derby County F.C.

Ward made the first of several key signings whilst he was at the club with the capture of inside forward Alan Durban for just \u00a310,000 from Cardiff City in July 1963, and gave an increased first team role to Ron Webster, who had been at the club as a youngster since Harry Storer's reign. Durban finished as top scorer, though he only hit 9 goals, as Derby improved slightly to record a finish of 13th in the 1963\u201364 Second Division. The season also saw Jack Parry hit his 100th league goal for the club, becoming only the 6th player to do so after Steve Bloomer, Jack Bowers, Harry Bedford, Sammy Crooks and Jackie Stamps, when he scored in a 3\u20130 home win over Swansea Town. The gradual improvement under Ward continued into the 1964\u201365 campaign, where Durban linked up well with new signing Eddie Thomas, signed for just \u00a33,500 from Swansea Town, as they both hit 22 league goals to help the Rams record a finish of 9th. The success of Thomas, who scored in each of his first 6 appearances for Derby to equal the club record, as later cited by Ward as counting against him \u2013 \"(Thomas) proved a marvellous bargain and after that I was expected to sign other players as cheaply.\"Derby County: The Complete Record (Breedon Books \u2013 2006), p. 118 The success of the Thomas/Durban partnership carried over into the 1965\u201366 season, where they both hit 17 goals, and the club climbed one place further to finish 8th, despite equalling the club's worst ever start to a league season by losing their first 4 games. The introduction of substitutions to English football saw Bobby Saxton become Derby County's first ever substitute player when he replaced Geoff Barrowcliffe after just 14 minutes of the opening day defeat by Southampton. Barrowcliffe went on to make his 500th appearance for the club when he started the 2\u20131 away defeat by Carlisle United on 7 September, only the fourth player to do so after Jimmy Methven, Steve Bloomer and his teammate Jack Parry."]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["Prior to the lead up to 1953 Stoke had agonisingly slipped into the relegation zone, but seven games without defeat at the turn of the year they seemed to have averted the danger.
