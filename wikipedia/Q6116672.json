This is Derby's only FA Cup triumph. Stamps came close to scoring in regular time but the ball burst as he shot, making it easier to save. Stamps was famous for his powerful shot and is a cult figure in Derby County history, with the club's annual Player of the Year award being named after him.\nIn 1942\u201343, Stamps made 14 guest appearances for Southampton, scoring 11 goals.He played for Burton Albion FC in the 1954\u20131955 season, signed by manager Reg Weston. He had scored 12 goals (including 2 penalties) in the Birmingham League and 6 goals in cup ties before the boxing day match against Gresley Rovers.He died in November 1991, barely two weeks before what would have been his 73rd birthday. Although blind for the final 20 years of his life, he continued to attend Derby County games.\nThere was a bar in Derby city centre named after him, but in the early 2000s it was changed to a Walkabout bar.", "link_mentions": {}}}
