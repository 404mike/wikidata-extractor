By the time Raymond and Agnes finally reached the London stage in June 1859 Loder was too ill to conduct (though he took a curtain call), and the duty fell to his cousin George Loder.  Moreover, the staging was not at one of London's major opera house, but at the less well-appointed St James's Theatre.  The production was organised by Augustus Braham, son of celebrated tenor John Braham, whose musical director Edward Loder had been at the St James's Theatre back in 1837.  The opera was part of an evening's entertainment that also included a pair of Spanish ballets.", "Fortunately the London production ensured publication of the opera in vocal score form, and over a hundred years later, in 1963, Nicholas Temperley, an assistant lecturer in music and fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, acquired a copy.Nicholas Temperley: 'The 1966 Revival of 'Raymond and Agnes', in Nicholas Temperley (ed.): Musicians of Bath and Beyond: Edward Loder (1809-1865) and His Family (The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, Suffolk, 2016).  .  Struck by the quality of the music, he discovered that the manuscript full score was preserved in the Library of Congress, and his determination that the music should be heard led to him staging the opera in Cambridge in May 1966--albeit that, believing the original libretto lost, he reduced and rearranged the score to a new libretto.  Critics shared his enthusiasm for the music, Peter Heyworth (The Observer, 9 May 1966) observing that \"the score develops a sustained dramatic attack that is all too rare in the annals of British opera\", Andrew Porter (The Financial Times, 19 May 1966) declaring the score \"a mine of richly inventive music\", and Stanley Sadie (Opera, July 1966) reporting that, \"Loder's melodies have been echoing through my mind since the performance.\"", "!|Premi\u00e8re cast,The Era (London), 19 August 185514 August 1855(cond.
