Led by the songwriting team of Tim Gane and L\u00e6titia Sadier, the group's music combines influences from krautrock, lounge and 1960s pop music, often incorporating a repetitive motorik beat with heavy use of vintage electronic keyboards and female vocals sung in English and French. Their lyrics have political and philosophical themes influenced by the Surrealist and Situationist movements. On stage, they play in a more feedback-driven and guitar-oriented style. The band also draw from funk, jazz and Brazilian music, and were one of the first artists to be dubbed \"post-rock\". They are regarded among the most innovative and influential groups of the 1990s.", "In 1985, Tim Gane formed McCarthy, a band from Essex, England, known for their left-wing politics. Gane met L\u00e6titia Sadier, born in France, at a 1988 McCarthy concert in Paris and the two quickly fell in love. The musically-inclined Sadier was disillusioned with the rock scene in France and soon moved to London to be with Gane and pursue her career. In 1990, after three albums, McCarthy broke up and Gane immediately formed Stereolab with Sadier (who had also contributed vocals to McCarthy's final album), ex-Chills bassist Martin Kean and Gina Morris on backing vocals. Stereolab's name was taken from a division of Vanguard Records demonstrating hi-fi effects.", "The group released six limited-edition singles in 2005 and 2006, which were anthologised in the 2006 compilation Fab Four Suture, and contained material which Mark Jenkins thought continued the brisker sound of the band's post-Hansen work. By June 2007, Stereolab's line-up comprised Tim Gane, L\u00e6titia Sadier, Andy Ramsay, Simon Johns, Dominic Jeffrey, Joseph Watson, and Joseph Walters. In 2008, the band issued their next album under the label 4AD titled, Chemical Chords, which \"[downplays] their arsenal of analog synths in favor of live instrumentation\". The release was followed by an autumn tour in Europe, the United States and Canada. ", "Their records have been heavily influenced by the \"motorik\" technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust. Tim Gane has supported the comparison: \"Neu! did minimalism and drones, but in a very pop way.\" Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that their music also had \"echoes of bubblegum, of exotica, of Beach Boys and bossa nova\", with their earlier work \"bearing strong Velvet Underground overtones\". Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were additional inspirations for the band. Stephan Davet of French newspaper Le Monde said that Emperor Tomato Ketchup (1996) had musical influences such as Burt Bacharach, and Fran\u00e7oise Hardy. The sounds influenced by minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich can be found on the 1999 album Cobra and Phases Group\u00a0Play Voltage in the Milky Night. Stereolab's style also incorporates easy-listening music of the 1950s and '60s. Joshua Klein in Washington Post said that, \"Years before everyone else caught on, Stereolab [were] referencing the 1970s German bands Can and Neu!, the Mexican lounge music master Esquivel and the decidedly unhip Burt Bacharach.\" Regarding their later work such as Instant 0 in the Universe (2003) and Margerine Eclipse (2004), critics have compared the releases to the band's earlier guitar-driven style.", "Stereolab alumni have also founded bands of their own. Guitarist Tim Gane founded the side project Cavern of Anti-Matter and also formed Turn on alongside band member Sean O'Hagan, who formed his own band the High Llamas. Katharine Gifford formed Snowpony with former My Bloody Valentine bassist Debbie Googe. Sadier has released three albums with her four-piece side-project Monade, whose sound Mark Jenkins called a \"little more Parisian\" than Stereolab's. Backing vocalist Mary Hansen formed a band named Schema with members of Hovercraft and released their eponymous EP in 2000.", "As of August 1999, US album sales stood at 300,000 copies sold. Despite receiving critical acclaim and a sizeable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. According to Sadier, however, the band \"[avoided] going overground\" like PJ Harvey, Pulp and the Cranberries, all of whom quickly rose from obscurity to fame, adding: \"This kind of notoriety is not a particularly good thing, [and] you don't enjoy it anymore.\" When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped along with many other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Tim Gane said in retrospect that the group \"signed to Elektra because we thought we would be on there for an album or two and then we'd get ejected. We were surprised when we got to our first album!\" Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic, the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). Gane said, \"...\u00a0we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don't have to ask for permission if we want to use it. We just want to be in control of our own music.\"", "*Tim Gane - guitar, keyboards "]}, {"page": "Mary Hansen", "response": ["By 1988, Hansen had moved to London and worked in various jobs.
