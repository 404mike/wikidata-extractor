These buildings flanked the church to the north and south, a proximity which was to be their undoing when the pious Lady Augusta Mostyn ordered their demolition in the latter years of the 19th century. The adjacency of the public houses to her estate was another factor which hastened their demise, as Lady Mostyn felt the nearness of such temptations was hampering the productivity of her workers. In 1898 Lady Mostyn came to an arrangement with the owner of the Mostyn arms - Sam Hughes - providing him with a freehold a short distance to the north on which he could build a new premises.
