Norton's unorthodox behaviour and candid conversation raised more than a few eyebrows among 19th-century English high society; she made enemies and admirers in almost equal measure. Among her friends she counted such literary and political luminaries as Samuel Rogers, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Edward Trelawny, Abraham Hayward, Mary Shelley, Fanny Kemble, Benjamin Disraeli, the future King Leopold I of Belgium and William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire.Perkin, p. 85.Perkins, pp. 19, 26, 48, 84 and 178."]}, {"page": "Identity of Junius", "response": ["This scholarly theory has been called the \"Franciscan theory\", at least since Abraham Hayward's More about Junius: The Franciscan theory unsound (1868).

His original advice to Lady Lade, was \"Endeavour, Madam, to procure him knowledge; for really ignorance to a rich man is like fat to a sick sheep, it only serves to call the rooks about him.\" As Lade grew up, Johnson grew disappointed: Hester Thrale reported that when Sir John asked Johnson for advice on whether he should marry, the reply came as: ", "\"I would advise no man to marry, Sir,\" replied the Doctor in a very angry tone, \"who is not likely to propagate understanding;\" and so left the room.Abraham Hayward (ed.), Autobiography, Letters and Literary Remains of Mrs. Piozzi (Thrale) (2nd ed.)

Johnstone also wrote non-fiction books on a range of subjects, like Scenes of Industry Displayed in the Beehive and the Anthill (1827) and Lives and Voyages of Drake, Cavendish, and Dampier (1831). These books, like most of Johnstone's volumes, were printed anonymously. Her The Cook and Housewife's Manual (1826) was issued under the pseudonym Margaret Dods. This use of Margaret Dods mirrored the character name of Margaret Dods, the hostess of the Cleikum Inn in Walter Scott's novel Saint Ronan's Well (1823). Later praised by Abraham Hayward in the The Quarterly Review. The cookbook is written from the perspective of Scott's character, and includes an introduction written by Scott that mentions other characters from the novel. It was only late in her life, as with The Edinburgh Tales (1846), that she was identified by name on her title pages."]}, {"page": "Frances Waldegrave", "response": ["La Bruy\u00e8re described Lady Waldegrave as \"a handsome woman with the virtues of an honest man,\" who united \"in her own person the best qualities of both sexes.\" Her reward for the exercise of these virtues was the affectionate friendship with which she was regarded by all who knew her. In conversation she preferred to listen rather than to shine. Flashes of wit occasionally came from her lips without effort or preparation, but she forgot her epigrams as soon as she uttered them; indeed she was known on more than one occasion to repeat her own jests, forgetting their origin and attributing them to other people. Her friends among politicians and men of letters included the Duc d'Aumale, the Duke of Newcastle, Edward Lear, Lords Grey and Clarendon, M. Van de Weyer, Bishop Wilberforce, Abraham Hayward, and Bernal Osborne. Among her associates who were nearer her own age, Sir William Harcourt (the nephew of her third husband), Lord Dufferin and Lord Ampthill, Julian Fane, and Lord Alcester were perhaps the most noteworthy. On 10 July 1870 she and her (4th) husband dined with Queen Victoria who noted - perhaps a little sharply - in her Journal: \"Ly Waldegrave & Mr Fortescue, the Van de Weyers & Ld Wrottesley dined. Ly Waldegrave is certainly a very clever woman.
