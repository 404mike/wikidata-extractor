During his time there his inventions included the Welman submarine and the Welbike. On leaving the British Army, Dolphin founded a number of companies, including the Corgi Motorcycle Co Ltd. in 1946 and also set up Dolphin Industrial Developments Ltd and Hydraulic Developments Ltd, which he ran until 1950, when he became Chief Engineer at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment. Dolphin then went on to become Engineer-in-Chief at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Research Group until 1959, became joint Managing Director of Lansing Bagnall Ltd and J. E. Shay Ltd until 1964, and a Director of TI (Group Services) Ltd, where he successfully secured patents for a number of inventions, including sheet piling revetments, improvements to fork lift trucks and the forerunner of the modern mobility scooter.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Special Operations Executive", "response": ["* John Dolphin CBE"]}, {"page": "Atomic Weapons Establishment", "response": ["*John Dolphin"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority", "response": ["* John Dolphin CBE"]}, {"page": "Red Beard (nuclear weapon)", "response": ["==John Dolphin==", "Whilst Chief Engineer at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE), Aldermaston, John Dolphin worked on the Red Beard trigger mechanism.  Subsequently, in July 1959, Dolphin requested an ex-gratia financial award for his work on the weapon; but was turned down.  His claim was that although it was not his job to do so, he invented the 'Rotary Hot Line' device that eventually became the trigger for the Red Beard bomb (and which was used in all subsequent thermonuclear bombs).  He further stated that his invention brought to an end the deadlock in meeting the specification for the Red Beard, and that he had to overcome \"serious opposition\" against the senior scientists whose job did include the brief for its invention.  His claim was refused on the grounds that as a 'Chief Engineer', it was within the scope of his duties."]}, {"page": "Welbike", "response": ["The original prototype was designed by SOE motor cycle enthusiast Harry Lester, from an idea developed by Lt. Colonel John Dolphin, the Commanding Officer of Station IX, the secret Inter-Services Military Research Establishment based in a mansion called The Frythe (latterly owned by the pharmaceutical company GSK) an hour's drive north of London near the town of Welwyn in Hertfordshire, which had been taken over for the war effort. Powered by a Villiers  single-cylinder two-stroke petrol (gasoline) engine, the Welbike was designed to fit into a CLE Canister \u2013 the standard parachute airdrop container  long,  high, and  wide. Once deployed, they were easily assembled and ready for use as quickly as possible. The name Welbike comes from the custom that all the clandestine equipment devised  at Station IX in Welwyn had names starting with Wel, e.g., Welman, Welrod. There was very limited space in the airborne equipment container, so the Welbike, which was carried in the container at an angle, had no suspension, no lights and just a single rear brake.", "Many of the later models never saw action and were disposed of at the end of the war, mostly exported to the U.S. where they were sold by a New York department store. The lack of a front brake meant that they could not legally be used on the road, however, so most were bought by farmers for off road use. The originator John Dolphin developed his ideas further and set up the Corgi Motorcycle Co Ltd. of which he was Managing Director, and had them produced as the Corgi by Brockhouse Engineering (Southport) Ltd., who had been manufacturing military trailers during the war. The Corgi scooter was powered by an Excelsior Spryt Autocycle engine and went into production in 1947. Most were initially exported to North America branded as the \"Indian Papoose\" and not sold in the UK until early 1948, with some 27,050 being manufactured. The single-speed two-stroke engine was too slow, however, and even despite the high post war demand for transport, lack of power and reliability problems meant it was discontinued in October 1954."]}, {"page": "Welman submarine", "response": ["Designed by the Commanding Officer of SOE's Inter Services Research Bureau (ISRB), Lt Col.
