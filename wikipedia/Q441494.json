The first of her seven novels was Hackenfeller's Ape (1953), a story about sending the titular ape, Percy, into space. Brophy's The Snow Ball (1964), is a glittering piece, weaving together her interests in sex, death and Mozart. In Transit (1969), is radical in form and handling, and was in the vanguard of gender-fluid literary conceptualisations. \nBrophy was a public figure, well-recognised for her forthright views. She agitated for homosexual equality, for vegetarianism, prison reform and humanism in an era when such ideas were regarded as cranky or dangerous. Often in demand in the media, she brilliantly argued the case against the Vietnam war, against sexual repression, marriage, and vivisection, and asserted eloquently that compulsory religious education in state schools was unjustifiable. \nBrigid Brophy was also a literary critic of exceptional repute, and a writer of substantial works of non-fiction. Among her critical studies were Mozart the Dramatist (1964, revised 1990) and Prancing Novelist: A Defence of Fiction ... In Praise of Ronald Firbank (1973).\nIn the Dictionary of Literary Biography: British Novelists since 1960, S. J. Newman described her as \"one of the oddest, most brilliant, and most enduring of [the] 1960s symptoms.\"\nShe married art historian Michael Levey in 1954. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 7", "response": ["*1995 \u2013 Brigid Brophy, English author and critic (b. 1929)"]}, {"page": "June 12", "response": ["*1929 \u2013 Brigid Brophy, English author and critic (d. 1995)"]}, {"page": "BBC Television Shakespeare", "response": ["The Prefaces to Shakespeare episode for As You Like It was presented by Janet Suzman, who had played Rosalind in a 1967 RSC production directed by George Rylands.
