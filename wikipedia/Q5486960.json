Allen scored with a header in the second half to help England beat the Scots 4\u20132 in the match at Hampden Park, and also had another headed goal disallowed.Matthews (2005) p. 58 He also appeared against Yugoslavia, and was included in England's initial squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, but did not make the final travelling party.Matthews (2005) p. 22 He nevertheless earned two further caps, the first of which was a 3\u20132 win against Wales in a British Home Championship game, and the last of which was against West Germany on 1 December 1954. Allen scored from six yards out in a 3\u20131 Wembley win against the World champions. He was again overlooked in the selection for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. He was seen to be too far ahead of his time. On his lack of England caps, Allen himself said, \"No two people see the game the same way and everyone is entitled to his own judgement\".Matthews (2005) p. 50 Albion teammate Frank Griffin stated that \"There was too much emphasis put on height for England strikers. They all had to be like Lawton and be over 6ft. He should have played for England more, there was no doubting Allen's sheer skill. That should have been enough.\""]}, {"page": "1954 FA Cup Final", "response": ["West Bromwich Albion were appearing in their ninth final, having won the cup on three previous occasions, while Preston had won the competition twice and were playing in the final for the sixth time.
