However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the recordings for the band's second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, who Wood felt failed in his role, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where the cellos and violins could not be heard over the electric instruments. However, Arden would manage Wizzard, despite Wood's negative comments towards Arden. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, who had been the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello, respectively."]}, {"page": "Totnes", "response": ["* Mike Edwards, former cellist with the Electric Light Orchestra from 1972 to 1975, lived in Totnes in the later years of his life until his death in 2010."]}, {"page": "List of people who died in traffic collisions", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Mike Edwards"]}, {"page": "Michael Edwards", "response": ["Michael or Mike Edwards may refer to:", "*Mike Edwards (basketball) (born early 1950s), American basketball player", "*Mike Edwards (cricketer) (born 1940), former cricketer", "*Mike Edwards (cornerback) (born 1991), American football player", "*Mike Edwards (safety) (born 1996), American football player", "*Mike Edwards (footballer, born 1974), Tranmere Rovers footballer", "*Mike Edwards (footballer, born 1980), Notts County F.C. footballer", "*Mike Edwards (high jumper) (born 1990), British-Nigerian athlete and winner at the 2018 British Indoor Athletics Championships", "*Mike Edwards (linebacker) (born 1957), American football player", "*Mike Edwards (motorcyclist) (born 1962), British motorcycle racer", "*Mike Edwards (pole vaulter) (born 1968), British pole vaulter", "*Mike Edwards (rugby league) (born 1974), rugby league footballer", "*Mike Edwards (second baseman) (born 1952), Major League Baseball second baseman, 1977\u20131980", "*Mike Edwards (third baseman) (born 1976), Major League Baseball infielder/outfielder, 2003\u20132006", "*Mike Edwards (musician) (1948\u20132010), cellist of the band Electric Light Orchestra", "*Mike Edwards (journalist), Scottish journalist for Scotland Today"]}, {"page": "Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)", "response": ["By January 1975, bass player Mike de Albuquerque and cellist Mike Edwards had left the band during the Eldorado's recording sessions and subsequent tour, respectively.
