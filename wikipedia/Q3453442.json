He developed interest in neuroanatomy and later went to National Hospital at Queen Square in Central London. At the National Hospital, Singh was associated with various notable neurologists like Russell Brain, 1st Baron Brain and MacDonald Critchley. Singh returned to India in 1931 and set up his medical practice in a village near Amritsar. With study of Alpha wave, also called Berger's rhythm in memory of Hans Berger, Singh undertook a training in electronics. In the 1940s, he developed an apparatus to record the electrical activity of the brains of laboratory animals. In 1950, he moved to Chicago and studied epilepsy patients of neurologist Percival Bailey taking their EEGs."]}]}}
