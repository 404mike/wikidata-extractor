Starting life at the Rocket in North London with a few hundred followers, the Source went on to a long residency at Brixton's 2,000 capacity Fridge and to host several larger 6,000 capacity parties in Brixton Academy, their New Year's Eve parties gaining reputations for being very special. The club toured across the UK, Europe and Israel throughout the 1990s and went as far as two memorable parties on the slopes of Mount Fuji in Japan and New York's Liberty Science Center. By 2001 the partners Chris Deckker, Mark Allen, Phil Ross and Janice Duncan were worn out and all but gone their separate ways. The last Return to the Source party was at Brixton Academy in 2002."]}, {"page": "Mark Allen", "response": ["Mark Allen may refer to:", "*Mark Allen (businessman) (born 1950), former British spy turned businessman and lecturer", "*Mark Allen (triathlete) (born 1958), American world champion triathlete", "*Mark Allen (snooker player) (born 1986), Northern Irish snooker player", "*Mark Allen (footballer) (born 1963), former Burnley, Tranmere Rovers and Runcorn football player", "*Mark Allen (software developer), computer game programmer and designer", "*Mark Allen (DJ), British deejay and producer", "*Mark Allen (politician), American politician from Oklahoma", "*Mark Allen, founder of Machine Project"]}, {"page": "Mark Allen (deejay)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Allen (DJ)"]}]}}
