From the later half of the 1940s to the middle half of the 1950s, he entered the circus life, where he met his future wife. However, he soon returned to photography and, in 1956, he left the circus and founded John Hinde Ltd. in Dublin to produce and distribute his colour pictures of Ireland. Hinde's most famous work is that of the Butlin's holiday camps, in which he portrayed a welcoming and jubilant environment. In 1972, he sold his company to pursue his love of painting. The Irish Museum of Modern Art recognised his work with a retrospective in Dublin in 1993. In 1997, Hinde died in Dordogne, France. At the time of his death, millions of his postcards had been sold worldwide.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Postcard", "response": ["Despite the decline in popularity of postcards that are overtly \"saucy\", postcards continue to be a significant economic and cultural aspect of British seaside tourism. Sold by newsagents and street vendors, as well as by specialist souvenir shops, modern seaside postcards often feature multiple depictions of the resort in unusually favourable weather conditions. British photographer John Hinde used saturated colour and meticulously planned his photographs, which made his postcards of the later twentieth century become collected and admired as kitsch.

In November, he published a book of his photographs, which were presented as postcards with captions such as 'Play Golf in Sussex', 'Cows of Cuckmere' and 'Singles Sussex'. In the book, Waller explained that the inspiration came from the postcards of John Hinde: \"The phrase 'picture postcard perfect' has a resonance for us all. It's not surprising then, albeit with more than a dash of irony, that I chose to present my images from this Sussex journey using the postcard format. There is another reason. I have long been a fan of John Hinde, who like me before becoming a photographer worked in the world of circus and entertainment....His cards had a very recognisable style, vivid garish colours, with everything and everyone perfectly positioned in the frame....This book gives a special nod to Hinde and generations of other seaside photographers.\"JJ Waller, 'A Word on the postcards', JJ Waller's Sussex by the Sea, Curious Publishing 2020", "Michelle Abadie, curator of the John Hinde Collection, was quoted on the back cover: \"At last - something good to come out of 2020! Flicking through this book reminded me of the fantastic postcards of 1960s roadside Americana. It shows the extravagant reality of the British seaside and the images are reminiscent of the extraordinary highly coloured world of John Hinde postcards. A joy.\"Michelle Abadie, JJ Waller's Sussex by the Sea, Curious Publishing 2020"]}]}}
