He was born in Darlaston, near Walsall.\nAfter being spotted playing amateur football, Evans was brought to Cardiff City by then manager Fred Stewart in the club's first season in The Football League, making his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat to Leeds United. In his second game, he scored what would later turn out to be his only goal for the club during a 3\u20130 victory over Nottingham Forest. Having helped the club to win promotion to the First Division in 1921, he struggled to make an impact on the side in his second year due to the performances of Billy Grimshaw and left the club in May 1923, signing for Second Division side Manchester United. There he played as back-up to Joe Spence, but he did not make his debut until April 1924, playing in the last six matches of the 1923\u201324 season, as the forward line was shuffled to cover the absent James Miller. His only two goals came in the 2\u20132 draw at home to Clapton Orient on 21 April 1924. Spence was ever-present in the 1924\u201325 season as Manchester United were promoted back to the First Division, and Evans took the opportunity to leave the club for Southern League side Pontypridd in August 1925.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sidney Evans", "response": ["* Sidney Evans (footballer) (1893\u2013?), or Sid, English footballer", "* Sidney Evans (boxer) (1881\u20131927), or Sid, British boxer"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["! scope=row|Sidney Evans"]}, {"page": "1921\u201322 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["! scope=row|Sidney Evans"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Cardiff's winning streak ended with a 2\u20132 draw with Burnley at Ninian Park on 2 April with both goals being scored by Keenor. With Gill and Davies both absent, defenders Keenor and Page were used as makeshift strikers. Keenor remained in his new role for a 3\u20130 defeat against Preston before international call-ups depleted Cardiff's squad even further with six players being named in their international squads. As a result, Herbert Kneeshaw, Sidney Evans, Fred Mason, Vince Jones and Billy Taylor were all called upon to make their first appearance of the season and helped the side to a 1\u20130 victory over Sheffield United. Cardiff's first team returned a week later for the reverse fixture but could only manage a goalless draw. The team finished their campaign with a 3\u20131 victory over Nottingham Forest and a 2\u20130 victory over Oldham before losing their final match 3\u20131 in the reverse fixture against Oldham. They finished the season in ninth position and were the highest scoring team in the First Division with 73 goals.", "! scope=row|Sidney Evans"]}]}}
