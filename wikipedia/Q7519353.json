He made 288 league appearances in a ten-year career in the Football League.\nHe began his career with local club Sheffield Wednesday in 1982, before moving on to York City three years later. Voted Clubman of the Year in 1986, he was sold on to Port Vale for \u00a335,000 in December 1987. He helped the \"Valiants\" to win promotion out of the Third Division via the play-offs in 1989, before injuries forced him to leave the professional game in May 1994. He later attempted comebacks with Boston United and Matlock Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Rudge", "response": ["In 1987\u201388, Vale were once again comfortable in mid-table. The cash-flow problem was eased by the sale of Andy Jones to Charlton Athletic for \u00a3350,000. Rudge spent \u00a375,000 for Simon Mills from York City, who would be a firm fixture in the first team for the next five seasons. On 20 January the club achieved a famous 2\u20130 victory over top-flight Spurs in the FA Cup. Before the cup run there were rumours that the directors were considering sacking Rudge due to a poor run of results in the league. The cup run and the sale of Jones helped to put the club in the black financially for the first time in a long time."]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["A major change occurred before the start of the 1987\u201388 season, as chairman Jim Lloyd stood down and was replaced by hard nosed businessman Bill Bell. Ten year man Russell Bromage went to Bristol City in exchange for \u00a325,000 and Lawrie Pearson, also Jon Bowden went to Wrexham for \u00a312,500. Coming in was striker Darren Beckford for \u00a315,000. Going into the season, Paul Smith went to Lincoln City for \u00a340,000, before Andy Jones was sold for a then-club-record fee of \u00a3350,000 to Charlton Athletic. \u00a335,000 of this went towards new full-back Simon Mills. The campaign was boosted by a 'famous' 2\u20131 victory over top-flight Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup. The cup run and sale of Jones had helped to pull in a record \u00a3410,239 profit. A boost for 1988\u201389 came with the sale of an unused training ground at Cobridge for \u00a3164,800. Halfway through the season, veteran Phil Sproson was advised to retire following a serious knee injury; to replace him, defender Dean Glover was signed from Middlesbrough for a club-record \u00a3200,000. The club finished third, failing to gain automatic promotion because of their worse goal difference. However they found success in the play-offs, defeating Bristol Rovers in the play-offs 2\u20131 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "1989 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["It was the first time either Port Vale or Bristol Rovers played a play-off final. Port Vale had previously posted two mid-table finishes following their promotion into the third tier in 1986. Bristol Rovers meanwhile had spent most of the decade in the third tier following relegation from the second tier in 1981. In the two league matches played between the clubs during the regular season, the two teams played out a 2\u20132 draw at Twerton Park in April, before Vale won the home fixture 1\u20130 in what was the penultimate game of the campaign. Port Vale had conceded fewer goals than any other team in the Third Division in the 1988\u201389 season. No team in the Football League had picked up as many home league draws as Bristol Rovers, with 11, whereas only the bottom two clubs of the Third Division had won fewer home fixtures. Port Vale quickly sold out their 1,500 ticket allocation at Twerton Park, whilst 4,000 Bristol Rovers fans secured tickets at Vale Park. Simon Mills had to postpone his honeymoon to play in the final. The second leg would be the first time Port Vale would play a competitive fixture in June. Port Vale were strong favourites, with The Guardian David Foot reporting that financially limited Bristol Rovers had made it to the play-offs \"against every apparent law of logic\" as manager Gerry Francis had built a squad with a transfer budget of \u00a320,000, half of which he had lent the club himself in order to sign Ian Holloway.", "The referee for the second leg was 1981 FA Cup final referee and Sheffield & Hallamshire County Football Association representative Keith Hackett. Port Vale manager John Rudge announced an unchanged team from the eleven that held Bristol Rovers to a 1\u20131 draw in the first leg. Francis was also able to name the same starting line-up for Bristol Rovers as the 13-man squad all passed fitness tests. The first half finished goalless despite large periods of pressure from Port Vale, with Martyn in good form in the Bristol Rovers goal. Martyn saved a  strike from Dean Glover, whilst Beckford and Earle both came close to taking the lead. The second half saw the \"MBE\" combination (a Simon Mills corner, flicked on by Beckford and knocked into the net by Earle) pay off, resulting in an Earle headed goal in the 52nd minute; it was his nineteenth goal of the season and fourth headed goal against Bristol Rovers that season. It was to prove the only goal of the match as Port Vale controlled the remainder of the game and a celebratory pitch invasion ensued. The Guardian's Stephen Bierley did not enjoy the match and his only praise for Bristol Rovers was that they \"did as little as possible to threaten the status quo, winning much praise from everybody by not forcing extra-time to extend the tedium\". In contrast, The Observer Derek Wallis reported that \"Rovers... played some delightful football but they were unable to penetrate a resolute defence... in which West and Glover needed to be constantly alert\". With the play-offs still a relatively new concept, both managers and some journalists were highly critical of the idea and agreed that Port Vale had deserved their promotion after finishing the league campaign in third place.", "|DF ||2||Simon Mills", "|DF ||2||Simon Mills"]}, {"page": "Simon Ashley Mills", "response": ["#REDIRECT Simon Mills (footballer)"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season began with Andy Jones scoring all four goals in his 100th appearance for the club, to beat Aldershot 4\u20132. With Pearson performing poorly, Darren Hughes was signed from Brighton & Hove Albion for a \u00a310,000 fee. Paul Smith was also offloaded to Lincoln City for \u00a340,000. Vale then won three consecutive games to go top of the table. After goal machine Andy Jones was sold to First Division Charlton Athletic for \u00a3350,000 \u2013 a sale Rudge described as like 'cutting off my right arm' \u2013 Vale slid down the table. Alex Williams was also forced to retire with a back injury, leading to the return of a fit again Mark Grew in goal. More injuries came as Chris Banks had his nose broken after a reserve match at Barnsley when he was attacked by a gang of youths whilst waiting at a fish and chip shop. Alan Webb then suffered second degree burns at Preston North End's plastic pitch at Deepdale. The next month Rudge tried to replace Jones when he signed David Riley from Nottingham Forest for \u00a320,000. Despite a good start Riley soon entered a goal drought, as Vale went twelve league games without a win (including eight defeats). Robbie Earle missed much of this period with a hernia injury. In November Kevin Steggles was signed from West Bromwich Albion for 'a small fee' to replace the still-injured Webb. More signings were made with former England international Peter Barnes arriving on loan from Manchester City, and 'hard-working' Simon Mills purchased from York City for \u00a335,000.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Simon Mills", "|5||DF||||Simon Mills||5||0||0||0||5", "| December 1987 || DF ||  || Simon Mills || York City || \u00a335,000 || "]}]}}
