All the officers of the company were wounded so, on his own initiative the rifleman ran forward over open ground, firing his Bren gun and at 20 yards range put an anti-tank gun and two machine-guns out of action. He was killed but his bravery inspired his comrades to further efforts to reach their objective, which was eventually captured, together with 100 prisoners.He is buried in the Knightsbridge War Cemetery, Acroma, Libya. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, England.
