He and his relatives who were British subjects relinquished the use of all German titles and styles, and adopted English surnames. George compensated several of his male relatives by creating them British peers. Thus, his cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, became the Marquess of Milford Haven, while his brother-in-law, the Duke of Teck, became the Marquess of Cambridge.

The system for titling members of the royal family was also simplified.Nicolson (195), p 310 Relatives of the British royal family who fought on the German side were simply cut off; their British peerages were suspended by a 1919 Order in Council under the provisions of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917."]}, {"page": "Princess Helena", "response": ["* Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein (1870\u20131948), daughter of Princess Helena of the United Kingdom"]}, {"page": "1948 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 13 March \u2013 Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, granddaughter of Queen Victoria (born 1870)"]}, {"page": "Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore", "response": ["* 1948 Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein (1870\u20131948), daughter of Princess Helena of the United Kingdom.
