His career spanned six decades, each providing its own challenges that were met head on by the man known to some as The Great Waldini and to others as Cardiff's Mr Music.During World War I he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Egypt, founding the unit's Welsh Rarebits concert party. After the war he continued his career as a cinema musician, until the \"talkies\" made his job redundant.  He survived the Great Depression by forming an orchestra comprising out of work musicians that played daily in Cardiff's Roath Park. They dressed in Romany outfits and called themselves Waldini and his Gypsy Band\nDuring World War II, he was invited by Jack Hylton on behalf of ENSA, to take his Gypsy Band to entertain the British and Commonwealth Forces at home and abroad; he later wrote of this experience in his self-published book Front Line Theatre.After the war Waldini and his Gypsy Band appeared during the summer months at holiday resorts throughout the UK, most notably Llandudno in North Wales and Ilfracombe in Devon.  For the last two years of his life he toured with his all-female band The Fabs, entertaining troops again, but this time at army bases on the Rhine.\nDuring his career he also found time for talent spotting and in the early 1940s gave Peter Sellers one of his first jobs. Some of his singers also went on to achieve fame, in particular Maureen Evans and Lorne Lesley (longtime wife of David Dickinson) who in 1964 topped the bill on Sunday Night at the London Palladium.Waldini died in St Winifred's Hospital, Cardiff on 5 January 1966.", "link_mentions": {}}}
