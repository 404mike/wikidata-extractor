He presented his television talk show Parkinson from 1971 to 1982 and from 1998 to 2007, as well as other talk shows and programmes both in the UK and internationally. He has also worked in radio. He has been described by The Guardian as \"the great British talkshow host\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dead Parrot sketch", "response": ["In a 2002 interview with Michael Parkinson, John Cleese said that when he and Palin were performing the sketch on Drury Lane, Palin made him laugh by saying, when asked if his slug could talk, \"It mutters a bit\" instead of \"Not really.\" When Cleese eventually stopped laughing, he couldn't remember where they were in the sketch. He turned to the audience and asked them what the next line was, and people shouted it at him, causing him to wonder, \"What is the point of this?\" He also says that when he and Palin were asked to do the sketch for Saturday Night Live they sat down together to try to remember the lines, and when they got stuck they considered just going out and stopping somebody on the street to ask how it went, since everybody seemed to have it memorised."]}, {"page": "March 28", "response": ["*  1935   \u2013 Michael Parkinson, English journalist and author"]}, {"page": "Michael Bentine", "response": ["In 1951 Bentine was invited to the United States to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show. On his return he parted amicably from his partners and continued touring in variety, remaining close to Secombe and Sellers for the rest of his life. In 1972, Secombe and Sellers told Michael Parkinson that Bentine was \"always calling everyone a genius\" and, since he was the only one of the four with a \"proper education\", they always believed him."]}, {"page": "Peter Cook", "response": ["Cook became a favourite of the chat show circuit but his effort at hosting such a show for the BBC in 1971, Where Do I Sit?, was said by the critics to have been a disappointment. It was axed after only three episodes and was replaced by Michael Parkinson, the start of Parkinson's career as a chat show host. Parkinson later asked Cook what his ambitions were, Cook replied jocularly \"[...] in fact, my ambition is to shut you up altogether you see!\""]}, {"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["On 20 April 1972, Sellers reunited with Milligan and Harry Secombe to record The Last Goon Show of All, which was broadcast on 5 October. In May 1973, with his third marriage failing, Sellers went to the theatre to watch Liza Minnelli perform. He became entranced with Minnelli and the couple became engaged three days later, despite Minnelli's current betrothal to Desi Arnaz, Jr., and Sellers still being married. Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up. By 1974, Sellers's friends were concerned that he was having a nervous breakdown. Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was \"a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. He was the complete contradiction.\" Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character. When he was invited to appear on Michael Parkinson's eponymous chat show in 1974, he withdrew the day before, explaining to Parkinson that \"I just can't walk on as myself\". When he was told he could come on as someone else, he appeared dressed as a member of the Gestapo. After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, \"was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity\". In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.", "As a kid Eddie Murphy developed playing multiple characters in imitation of his acting hero, with Chris Rock hailing Murphy's performances (such as the multiple roles in The Nutty Professor) \"Peter Sellers-esque.\" During an interview in 2002, Robin Williams told Michael Parkinson that Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in Dr. Strangelove, stating, \"It doesn't get better than that.\" Williams was considered to play Sellers in the HBO biopic but turned it down over scheduling conflicts, though Williams considered it an honour to be able to portray him.video:  Eddie Izzard notes that the Goons \"influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as 'alternative'\"\u2014including himself, while the media historian Graham McCann states \"the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show\u00a0... would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents,\u00a0...

His 1981 interviews on the talk shows of Michael Parkinson and Merv Griffin alarmed family and friends; viewers wondered if Niven had either been drinking or suffered a stroke. He blamed his slightly slurred voice on the shooting schedule of the film he had been making, Better Late Than Never. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as \"Lou Gehrig's disease\") later that year. His final appearance in Hollywood was hosting the 1981 American Film Institute tribute to Fred Astaire."]}, {"page": "Tommy Cooper", "response": ["By the mid-1970s alcohol had started to erode Cooper's professionalism and club owners complained that he turned up late or rushed through his show in five minutes. In addition he suffered from chronic indigestion, lumbago, sciatica, bronchitis and severe circulation problems in his legs. When Cooper realised the extent of his maladies he cut down on his drinking, and the energy and confidence returned to his act. However, he never stopped drinking and could be fallible: on an otherwise triumphant appearance with Michael Parkinson he forgot to set the safety catch on the guillotine illusion into which he had cajoled Parkinson, and only a last-minute intervention by the floor manager saved Parkinson from serious injury or worse.", "On 5 March 2021 BBC One aired the 30-minute documentary Tommy Cooper at the BBC, looking at his best performances, including his appearance on the Parkinson show where he almost killed Michael Parkinson with a trick guillotine.

And then everybody who rang him, they got me saying, 'Not many people know that.'\"Michael Caine Interview. BBC TV's Parkinson show, no date, 0:49. Over the years Caine himself had parodied his catchphrase and his \"interesting facts\", and has imitated others' impressions of him. In an interview with Michael Parkinson in 2007, Caine commented on the impersonations of his voice, \"I can do it. 'Hello. My name is Michael Caine. Not many people know that.' I sound like a bloody moron. You know where they've got me now? On birthday cards. 'It's your birthday today. Not many people know that'. Now they've got me on Satellite navigation.

Local Labour politicians tended to feel that he had accomplished little, although they acknowledged his good intentions. However a more positive assessment was offered by Michael Parkinson, Professor of Urban Affairs at John Moores University: although he had been sceptical in the 1980s, by 1997 he had come to favour the policies championed by Heseltine: assignment of ministers to regions, development of housing associations and cooperatives, and the channelling of government money through business-led agencies rather than through local government.Crick 1997, pp. 241\u20132."]}, {"page": "Bobby Robson", "response": ["On 31 July 2009, Robson died of lung cancer at his home in County Durham, aged 76, after a long battle with the disease.

According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson \"epitomised everything that is great about football in this country\". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, \"Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones.
