His first ambition was to be a doctor but financial constraints prevented this. Still in his teens, he began playing drums for local dance bands and by 1928 had formed his own band, the Embassy Band, which swept the prizes in the All-Scottish Dance Band Championship that year. Elrick turned professional and moved to London where he became friends with the crooner Al Bowlly, and began singing himself. He joined the Henry Hall Orchestra as a vocalist and drummer and their 1936 recording of The Music goes Round and Round made Elrick a star. In 1937, he left Hall to form his own band, and in 1939 began a solo career, which was moderately successful through the years of World War II.\n\nIn 1948, he took a touring revue round Britain, and was asked by the BBC to stand in for two weeks as disc-jockey on the morning record request show Housewives' Choice.  The 'temporary' job lasted almost twenty years, as Elrick's Scottish accent and liberal use of catchphrases became highly popular. Memorably, he would sign off each show by singing the words 'I'll be with you all again tomorrow morning' to the (wordless) theme tune, and noting 'This is Mrs Elrick's wee son George saying thanks for your company - and cheerio!'.\nIn later years, he became something of an impresario and acted as an agent for numerous musicians such as Mantovani.\nHe was married and had a son. He published an autobiography, Housewives' Choice - The George Elrick Story.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Juke Box Jury", "response": ["* 17 February 1962 \u2013 Petula Clark, George Elrick, Jean Metcalfe, Jimmy Young"]}, {"page": "Adelaide Hall", "response": ["Unexpectedly, the show Variety became one of the first British theatrical casualties of World War II and part of the mystery surrounding \"what really happened at the BBC on 1 September 1939?\" That year, Hall became a featured vocalist with Joe Loss & His BandJoe Loss biography, in which Adelaide Hall is mentioned as being a featured vocalist in his band: \"The new-featured vocalist in Joe Loss's broadcasts is one of America's veterans of jazz singing, her career dating back to the first big Negro revue, Shuffle Along, produced on Broadway in 1921.\" and from 1939 to 1941, Hall headlined the popular BBC Radio variety show Piccadixie.PROGRAMME FOR THE FORCES HOME SERVICE. \"PIccadixie\" (Variety) 12.00 midnight radio show.
