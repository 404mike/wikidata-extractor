Andy soon moved to Miami Beach, Florida, to begin working on songs with his brother Barry and co-producers Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson. In late 1976 in Miami, Andy, with older brother Barry producing and recording in the famed Criteria Studios, set about making his first album Flowing Rivers. Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh played on two songs on the album. The first release from the album, and Gibb's first single released outside Australia, was \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\" which was written by Barry, who also provided backup vocals. It reached number-one in the United States and Australia and was the most played record of the year. In Britain it was a lesser hit, just scraping into the Top 30. Eight of the ten tracks on the album were Andy Gibb compositions, mostly songs written during his time in Australia. These included a re-recording of his previous single, \"Words and Music\". In September 1977 Flowing Rivers, with another number-one single \"(Love Is) Thicker Than Water\" (also co-written by Gibb and his brother Barry) to support it, quickly became a million-selling album. That single broke in early 1978 during the time that the Bee Gees' contributions to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack were dominating the world charts. In the United States it replaced \"Stayin' Alive\" at the top of the Hot 100 on the day before Andy's 20th birthday, only to be surpassed by \"Night Fever\" at number-one there two weeks later."]}, {"page": "Jellyfish (band)", "response": ["Jellyfish recorded their first album Bellybutton at Schnee Studios in Hollywood with producer Albhy Galuten, best known for his work with the Bee Gees on Saturday Night Fever, and engineer Jack Joseph Puig. Unusually, the band's demos were almost as fully realized as the studio recordings. Manning explained that the group took extra care in writing and arranging material due to the stresses of hourly studio costs, as they wanted to use the time to experiment musically, and because \"Andy and I had to believe 100 per cent, 'Okay, this [song] is working. This is mostly going somewhere. We feel that this is now fleshed out enough that we\u2019re confident to be in the studio environment.'\"  No synthesizers or sequencers were used on the recording. Redd Kross bassist Steve McDonald, who played on the album, said that Manning intended the record to sound \"somewhere between Queen and Partridge Family\"."]}, {"page": "Tragic Kingdom", "response": ["* Albhy Galuten \u2013 director of paradigm "]}, {"page": "Spilt Milk (Jellyfish album)", "response": ["Spilt Milk is the second and last studio album by American rock band Jellyfish, released on February 9, 1993 by Charisma Records. It features a harsher and more ornate sound than their previous, Bellybutton (1990). As with Bellybutton, Spilt Milk was written and co-produced by founding members Andy Sturmer and Roger Manning. Albhy Galuten and Jack Joseph Puig also returned as producers.", "The songs were written in Los Angeles between October 1991 and March 1992. Manning would go over to Sturmer's home to work on the album for eight hours a day, six days a week. Production lasted from April to September 1992; recording sessions used massed choirs, strings, brass, flutes, wind chimes, harpsichords and other instruments. The album was produced by the same producers as their debut, Albhy Galuten (of Bee Gees fame) and Jack Joseph Puig alongside Manning and Sturmer themselves. Also featured on the album were guitarists T Bone Burnett, Lyle Workman, and Jon Brion (who soon formed the Grays with Falkner). Friend Andy Zax wrote of an anecdote in which he met Manning for a late-night meal at a delicatessen, only for Manning to excuse himself \"back to the studio because everyone was still there working.  It was 3AM.\" Sturmer remembered: \"Once I literally passed out doing a vocal and woke up in the next room. Making this record was like that Army commercial: 'The toughest job you'll ever love.'\""]}, {"page": "The Beacon Street Collection", "response": ["* Advisor: Albhy Galuten"]}, {"page": "Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs", "response": ["*Albhy Galuten \u2013 piano (on \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\")"]}, {"page": "Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical", "response": ["* Bee Gees, Albhy Galuten, Karl Richardson", "| Bee Gees, Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson"]}, {"page": "Samantha Sang", "response": ["She visited Barry Gibb in France whilst the Bee Gees were recording songs for the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.
