He played twice in first-class matches for Kent County Cricket Club in 1881 against MCC and Derbyshire before playing once the following year for Hampshire against Somerset.There is some doubt that the same man played for both Kent and Hampshire, and very little is known about King's life. It is possible that he was a carpenter and lived at Tonbridge in Kent with his wife at the 1881 Census. His date of death is unknown.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James King", "response": ["James King, Jim King or Jimmy King may refer to:", "*James King, 1st Lord Eythin (1589\u20131652), Scottish general in Swedish service and later in the English Civil War", "*James King (Royal Navy officer) (1750\u20131784), British Royal Navy captain who served under James Cook", "*James King King (1806\u20131881), British MP for Herefordshire", "*James King (Quebec politician) (1848\u20131900), Canadian businessman and member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec", "*James King (Maryland politician) (born 1974), member of the Maryland House of Delegates", "*James King (Australian cricketer) (1851\u20131921), Australian cricketer", "*James King (cricketer, born 1855) (1855\u2013?), English cricketer", "*James King (cricketer, born 1869) (1869\u20131948), English cricketer", "*James King (cricketer, born 1942), English cricketer", "*James King (Scottish footballer) (1906\u20131985), Scottish international footballer", "*James King (English footballer) (born 1996), English footballer", "*James King (rugby league), rugby league footballer for Ireland, Barrow Raiders, and Leigh Centurions", "*James King (rugby union, born 1986), Scottish rugby union player", "*James King (rugby union, born 1987),  New Zealand rugby union player", "*James King (rugby union, born 1990), Welsh rugby union player", "*James King (hurdler) (born 1949), American hurdler", "*Jack King (animator) (1895\u20131958), American animator, especially with Walt Disney, whose real name was James King", "*James King (tenor) (1925\u20132005), American opera singer", "*James King (bluegrass) (1958\u20132016), American bluegrass music singer", "*James King (film critic), British broadcast film critic", "*James King (musician), American soul musician, member of the band Fitz and The Tantrums", "*Jaime King (born 1979), American actress and model, sometimes billed as James King", "*James King, 4th Baron Kingston (1693\u20131761), British peer", "*James King (priest) (1715\u20131795), Canon of Windsor and Dean of Raphoe", "*James King, 5th Earl of Kingston (1800\u20131869), Irish peer and barrister", "*James King (pioneer) (1800\u20131857), Scottish-born Australian businessman and winemaker", "*James King of William (1822\u20131856), American newspaper editor", "*Sir James King, 1st Baronet (1830\u20131911), Scottish businessman, and Lord Provost of Glasgow, 1886\u201389", "*James King (architect) (fl. 1860s\u20131892), American architect", "* James King, Australian artist, winner of the first Waterhouse Natural History Art Prize in 2003", "*James King, a fictional character in the U.S. TV series Last Resort"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*James King, cricketer, was born in Southampton"]}, {"page": "James King (Kent and Hampshire cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James King (cricketer, born 1855)"]}]}}
