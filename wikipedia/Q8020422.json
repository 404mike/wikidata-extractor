In the years thereafter he established himself as the foremost European merchant in the city, which was at that time an important trading port linking Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa to Europe and North America. Today Willshire is best remembered as the man who redeemed, cared for, and helped repatriate hundreds of Western sailors enslaved in the Sultanate of Morocco during the early part of the 19th century, including Captain James Riley, Robert Adams, and Captain Alexander Scott, all of whom would later write and publish harrowing accounts of their hardships endured as slaves in the desert. The town of Willshire in the US state of Ohio is named after him, in thanks, by James Riley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Willshire, Ohio", "response": ["Willshire was founded by Captain James Riley in 1822, and is named for the English man who saved him while he was a captive in Africa, William Willshire.

Most were Americans. After sailing for several days in dense fog, the ship ran aground on a reef near Cape Bojador. After being attacked and ransacked on shore by Sahrawi natives, who killed one of the seamen in cold blood, the crew returned to their rowboat and attempted to reach the Cape Verde Islands or hoped to meet another passing ship. This proved impossible, as their meager provisions were running out, and they decided to return to shore and take their chances with the local tribes. Landing some 300 miles further south down the coast, near Cape Barbas, less than one hundred miles north of Cape Blanco, they were taken captive by nomads of the Oulad Bou Sbaa tribe. The survivors were eventually rescued thanks to James Simpson, the American consul at Tangier, and William Willshire, British Vice Consul to Mogadore (Essaouira), Morocco. Morocco had been the first country to recognize the United States and attempted to maintain generally friendly relations despite the behavior of corsairs and raiders within their borders."]}, {"page": "Willshire", "response": ["*William Willshire ( - 1851), British diplomat"]}, {"page": "James Riley (captain)", "response": ["Riley founded the midwestern village of Willshire, Ohio, which he named for William Willshire, the man who redeemed him from slavery."]}, {"page": "Sufferings in Africa", "response": ["Eventually they arrived at the outskirts, and Hamet took the note, which was addressed to the town's consul, into town.

Hamet told this man about his \"friend\" and gave him the note. This consul, William Willshire, impressed by the sincerity of the note, agreed to pay.
