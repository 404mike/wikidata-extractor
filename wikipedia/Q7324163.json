His work has mostly concerned his family, the place he grew up in the West Midlands, but also landscapes elsewhere.\nBillingham is best known for the Photobook Ray's A Laugh (1996), which documents the life of his alcoholic father Ray, and obese, heavily tattooed mother Liz. He has also published the collections Black Country (2003), Zoo (2007), and Landscapes, 2001\u20132003 (2008). He has made several short films, including Fishtank (1998) and Ray (2016).
