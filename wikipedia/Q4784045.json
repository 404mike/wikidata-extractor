He had been the first player to rise up through the junior ranks of the Phoenix organisation to the EIHL squad.\nFox did not manage to start a game for the Phoenix however, and was used as the back-up goaltender behind the ex-Atlanta Thrashers player Scott Fankhouser.

This led to his selection for the Under-18 squad of the Manchester Phoenix following trials at the Altrincham Ice Dome.  In his first season with the Phoenix, Summerfield continued to impress, managing a 2.00 GAA in 13 games and claiming a shut-out against the Nottingham Jaguars.  This led to his promotion to the Elite League squad, replacing Aran Fox and Summerfield made his short debut coming on to replace Scott Fankhouser in a 5-2 loss for the Phoenix in Yorkshire against the Sheffield Steelers.  Summerfield continued to make a number of appearances for the rest of the season, but was still employed as back-up."]}]}}
