She placed second in the event at that year's National Championships.Thomas was fifth over 1500 m at the Olympic Trials in 2008, but went on to be the surprise winner of the 1500 m at the 2009 National Championships ahead of the more favoured Stephanie Twell and Hannah England. This guaranteed her a place for the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, where she made it into the semi-finals of the women's 1500 metres in Berlin. However, she lost a running spike mid-race and did not manage to make the final.She did not compete for Great Britain in 2010 and that September she decided to leave her job as a Design and Technology supply teacher to focus on running full-time. She returned to the international setup the following year to compete at the 2011 European Team Championships, where she unexpectedly defeated Yekaterina Martynova and Anna Mishchenko to take full points for the team.

As Charlene Thomas surprisingly won the British trials, she was selected by default. Lisa Dobriskey, who had finished 4th at the Beijing Olympics the previous year and was still in good form, was also selected on merit; the last remaining place was between England and Stephanie Twell. As Twell had a faster time that season, as well as higher youth achievement, she was selected over England.
