The remaining games were against Halifax Town and Torquay, the two teams below Gillingham in the table.  On 1 May, Gillingham defeated Halifax 2\u20130 at Priestfield with goals from Tony Eeles and Baker; the result meant that Gillingham could no longer finish below their opponents and were therefore safe from relegation.  The game drew a crowd of 7,151, the largest attendance of the season for a league match at Priestfield by a margin of more than 3,000.  After the match, Roeder commented to the press that it had been the most important game in Gillingham's history, saying \"All the emotion you can imagine. It was a Cup tie, wasn't it?\"  Gillingham lost to Torquay in the final match of the season and finished 21st, one place above Halifax, who lost their place in the Football League.  The defeat meant that, for the first time in the club's history, Gillingham had gone through an entire season without winning a league game away from home.  Reviewing the season for the magazine When Saturday Comes ten years later, Chris Lynham characterised the team as poor in all areas, picking out Aylott's unsatisfactory performance as a replacement for Beadle up front and the regularity with which the defence conceded goals in injury time.  Contrary to Blackmore's prediction prior to the season, only four teams in the Third Division scored fewer goals than Gillingham."]}]}}
