In written orders Montgomery required an advance across the Orne River and the capture of high ground south of Caen, which was prevented by the defenders. Clark wrote that there were implicit objectives with strategic implications, more important than the capture of ground. In 1971, Stephen Ambrose wrote of Epsom veering off-course from the plan and D'Este that Epsom was \"an operation of immense intentions which were not attained\", calling it a \"dismal failure\". In 2004, Simon Trew and Stephen Badsey wrote of the British failure that it \"... took most of six Panzer Divisions to stop Epsom short of its final objectives....\" and Michael Reynolds in 2002 wrote that without the commitment of the six divisions, it was highly likely that the British offensive would have achieved its goals. Ian Daglish in 2007 wrote that while the original concept of Epsom had failed, the offensive was a strategic success. By withdrawing the 11th Armoured Division across the Odon and then into reserve, the Second Army had re-created the threat of an offensive near Caen. By the end of June, all German armoured forces in Normandy were concentrated on the Second Army front."]}, {"page": "59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division", "response": ["On 17 July, the 176th Brigade launched an attack towards Bordel, and captured the area the following day. The 197th Brigade made a further attempt to capture its first-phase objectives, which it finally achieved and then advanced to capture Ferme de Guiberon. Meanwhile, repeated attempts were made to take Noyers. The 1/6SSR, 2/6SSR, and 5SSR made several attempts throughout the 17th, but their attacks were defeated by the German 277th Division holding the village, which had been reinforced by the 9th-SS Panzer Division's reconnaissance battalion. The following day, the 177th Brigade launched two major attacks on Noyers that were also repulsed. Preparations were made for the 197th Brigade to assault Noyers on the 19th, but Operation Pomegranate was closed down following the launch of Goodwood. Peter Knight, author of the 59th Divisional history, wrote \"The aim of Pomegranate had been to attract enemy attention ... away from the Caen Sector. In this we had succeeded, and Noyers itself had little tactical significance for us.\" Simon Trew, a historian, supports this position, indicating that the attacks made by XII and XXX Corps forced the Germans to keep the 2nd Panzer, 9th-SS Panzer, and 10th-SS Panzer divisions committed to the wrong sector of the battlefield and away from where Goodwood was launched. Ian Daglish, a historian, wrote \"the results [of the fighting] were inconclusive\", but they had the result of \"keeping the defenders busy (and drawing in important parts of the elite 9. SS-Panzerdivision, Hohenstaufen).\" The fighting cost the division 1,250 men killed, wounded or missing. In exchange, 575 prisoners were taken."]}, {"page": "Napoleon's Last Battles", "response": ["In Issue 11 of Phoenix (Jan-Feb 1978), Ian Daglish called both the map and the counters \"vastly improved\" over previous SPI Napoleonic products. And despite having a large number of counters to maneuver, Daglish found the game \"still flows very nicely.\" He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \"Napoleon's Last Battles is a set of four highly enjoyable games. It is also one of the best simulations of the whole Waterloo campaign that you will come across.\""]}]}}
