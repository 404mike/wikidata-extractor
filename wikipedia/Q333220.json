Elected to the House of Commons in 1810 as a Whig, he was Member of Parliament for some constituencies until becoming a peer in 1834.\nBrougham won popular renown for helping defeat the 1820 Pains and Penalties Bill, an attempt by the widely disliked George IV to annul his marriage to Caroline of Brunswick. He became an advocate of liberal causes including abolition of the slave trade, free trade and parliamentary reform. Appointed Lord Chancellor in 1830, he made a number of reforms intended to speed up legal cases and established the Central Criminal Court. He never regained government office after 1834 and although he played an active role in the House of Lords, he often did so in opposition to his former colleagues.\nEducation was another area of interest. He helped establish the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and University College London, as well as holding some academic posts, including Rector, University of Edinburgh. In later years he spent much of his time in the French city of Cannes, making it a popular resort for the British upper-classes; he died there in 1868.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux (1778\u20131868), statesman, one of the founders of the Edinburgh Review, Lord Chancellor"]}, {"page": "May 7", "response": ["*1868 \u2013 Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux, Scottish lawyer and politician, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain (b. 1778)"]}, {"page": "September 19", "response": ["*1778 \u2013 Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux, Scottish lawyer and politician, Lord Chancellor of Great Britain (d. 1868)"]}, {"page": "1868", "response": ["* May 7 \u2013 Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain (b. 1778)"]}, {"page": "1778", "response": ["** Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux, British politician (d. 1868)"]}, {"page": "Atlantic slave trade", "response": ["However, both James Stephen and Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux wrote that the slave trade could be abolished for the benefit of the British colonies, and the latter's pamphlet was often used in parliamentary debates in favour of abolition. William Pitt the Younger argued on the basis of these writings that the British colonies would be better off, in economics as well as security, if the trade was abolished. As a result, according to historian Christer Petley, abolitionists argued, and even some absentee plantation owners accepted, that the trade could be abolished \"without substantial damage to the plantation economy\". William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville argued that \"the slave population of the colonies could be maintained without it.\" Petley points out that government took the decision to abolish the trade \"with the express intention of improving, not destroying, the still-lucrative plantation economy of the British West Indies.\"Petley, White Fury, pp. 190-209."]}, {"page": "Cannes", "response": ["Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise.
