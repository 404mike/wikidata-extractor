Born into a working-class family in Manchester, She appeared in many French and Italian operas, but was best known as a Wagnerian. In addition to many appearances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, she was seen frequently at the Metropolitan Opera, New York in the early years of the 20th century. She died in London, aged 56.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Samson and Delilah (opera)", "response": ["In England, the opera was first performed on 25 September 1893 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Although the company planned on performing the work in a fully staged production, the Lord Chamberlain objected to a Biblical work being mounted and the company was forced to present the opera in a concert version. It was not staged in London until 1909 when the ban was finally lifted. Louise Kirkby Lunn portrayed Dalila and Charles Fontaine portrayed Samson in the 1909 production. Subsequently, Paul Franz replaced Fontaine in the protagonist's role, earning the composer's praise for both the quality of his voice and his interpretation."]}, {"page": "1930 in music", "response": ["*February 17 \u2013 Louise Kirkby Lunn, operatic contralto, 56"]}, {"page": "The Dream of Gerontius", "response": ["In the first decades after its composition leading performers of the tenor part included Gervase Elwes and John Coates, and Louise Kirkby Lunn, Elena Gerhardt and Julia Culp were admired as the Angel.
