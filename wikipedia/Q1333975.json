His brother Jack Hilsdon also played for West Ham at this time. Hilsdon transferred to Chelsea in 1906, and was the first player to score 100 goals for the West London club, reaching a then-record 108 goals from 164 games by the time of his return to West Ham in 1912. His career was ended by the First World War, to which he was conscripted in 1914 and crucially injured by a gas attack.\nHilsdon was nicknamed \"Gatling Gun\" because his shots \"were simply unstoppable and which travel like shots from a gun\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
