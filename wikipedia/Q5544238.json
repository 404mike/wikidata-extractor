He played List A cricket as well as performing in the ICC Trophy between 1997 and 2001.\nSalmond is now a legend and head of the Junior School at George Watson's College, Edinburgh. Since his retirement from cricket, he has become a football referee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2007 Cricket World Cup", "response": ["The tournament was also criticised as being too long. At 6 weeks, it was the same length as the 2003 World Cup, but longer than the 5-week 1999 World Cup and the 4-week 1996 World Cup. The famous West Indian fast bowler Michael Holding also criticised the qualification process for the 2007 World Cup. Holding expressed doubts over the benefit to less-established teams of turning up and being heavily defeated. However, former Scotland captain George Salmond claims that the opportunity to play one-day cricket against the bigger teams is invaluable for smaller teams such as his own, and questioned the validity of Holding's statements. The majority of the experts and players participating in the tournament backed up the smaller teams taking part in the World Cup. This was further backed up with Ireland and Bangladesh making the Super 8s and being competitive and sportsmanlike throughout the tournament."]}, {"page": "List of Scotland ODI cricketers", "response": ["George Salmond was Scotland's first ODI captain, leading his team in the 1999 World Cup. In the intervening years between the World Cup and Scotland gaining ODI status in 2006, the captaincy had passed on to Craig Wright. After his team were knocked out of the 2007 World Cup in the first round, Wright resigned the captaincy. He was replaced by Ryan Watson. Watson said Wright was a hard act to follow and he intended \"to pick up where Craig left off, bring in some of my own ideas and hopefully achieve the same level of success\". Early in 2009, after Scotland failed to qualify for the 2011 World Cup, Watson stepped down as captain and was replaced by Gavin Hamilton."]}, {"page": "Salmond", "response": ["*George Salmond (born 1969), Scottish cricketer and football referee"]}, {"page": "Cricket at the 1998 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["* George Salmond (c)"]}, {"page": "Cricket Scotland", "response": ["* George Salmond"]}, {"page": "1999 Cricket World Cup squads", "response": ["| George Salmond (c)"]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national cricket captains", "response": ["|| 1 || George Salmond || 1999 || 5 || 0 || 0 || 5 || 0", "|| 1 || George Salmond || 1996/97\u20132001 || 19 || 13 || 0 || 5 || 1"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Raith Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|George Salmond", "|George Salmond", "|George Salmond", "|George Salmond"]}]}}
