In total WAAC acquired artworks from some four hundred artists. It also issued permits allowing artists access to otherwise restricted areas and rationed materials. Wartime rationing restricted good quality paper for printmaking and materials for sculpture so such works were under-represented in the WAAC collection. In June 1941, WAAC established a scheme to obtain artworks by artists from Britain's overseas colonies. Although four artists were sent to record the activities of the British Expeditionary Force in France, at the start of the war the majority of WAAC commissions were for subjects on the British home front, but as the conflict progressed twenty-six men were given overseas commissions. Among these were Edward Ardizzone, Henry Carr, and Edward Bawden who each went to the Middle East, Leslie Cole was sent to Malta, France and South-East Asia, Vivian Pitchforth went to Burma, and Anthony Gross went to the Middle East and Burma before joining the Normandy landings. Two women, Mary Kessell and Laura Knight, were also, towards the end of the war, given overseas commissions. Other artists serving overseas but working without a WAAC commission or contract, submitted work which was then purchased by the Committee. These included Doris Zinkeisen and Stella Schmolle serving with the Red Cross and the Auxiliary Territorial Service respectively. Three artists, Thomas Hennell, Eric Ravilious and Albert Richards, were killed during the Second World War whilst working on WAAC commissions.", "* Henry Carr"]}, {"page": "Henry Carr (disambiguation)", "response": ["Henry Carr (1941\u20132015) was an American track and field athlete.", "Henry Carr may also refer to:", "* Henry Carr (artist) (1894\u20131970), British landscape painter and war artist", "* Henry Carr Crusaders", "* Father Henry Carr Catholic Secondary School, Toronto (Etobicoke), Ontario"]}, {"page": "Henry Marvell Carr", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Carr (artist)"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* Henry Carr, painter"]}]}}
