Reid's own ancestors served in the British Army and the East India Company, who fought at, among other places and sites, Culloden, Bunker Hill, and the Texas Revolution. He has controversially advised on historical re-enactments for the benefit of film companies and appeared in a number of documentaries but this has caused some criticism by sources concerned about revisionist historians and archeologists.He has two sons and currently lives in North Tyneside.\nHis books include the following -", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Stirling Bridge", "response": ["In 1296, John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, defeated John Comyn, Earl of Buchan in the Battle of Dunbar.

In 1297, Moray initiated a revolt in northern Scotland and by the late summer, controlled Urquhart, Inverness, Elgin, Banff and Aberdeen.  Wallace joined Moray in September near Dundee, and they marched to Stirling.

After concluding a truce with the French king, Philip the Fair in October 1297, he returned to England on 14 March 1298 to continue the ongoing organising of an army for his second invasion of Scotland which had been in preparation since late 1297. As a preliminary step he moved the centre of government to York, where it was to remain for the next six years.  A council-of-war was held in the city in April to finalise the details of the invasion.  The Scottish magnates were all summoned to attend, and when none appeared they were all declared to be traitors.  Edward then ordered his army to assemble at Roxburgh on 25 June. The force counted 2,000 armoured cavalry and about 12,000 infantry receiving wages, though, after the manner of medieval armies there would have been many more serving without pay either as a statement of personal independence, forgiveness of debts to the crown, criminal pardons or just for adventure,Paterson, Raymond Campbell For the Lion:History of the Scottish Wars of Independence John Donald Publishers Ltd (29 August 1997)  pp. 21, 165 including 10,900 Welshmen.\"The Welsh soldier: 1283\u20131422\", University of Southampton  Stuart Reid estimates Edward's force at 214 knights with 900 troopers, 1000 cavalry supplied by the Earls, 500 mercenary crossbowmen, 2000 archers with billmen from the Lancashire and Cheshire feudal levies, and 10,500 Welshmen, though the infantry may only have totalled 8,000."]}, {"page": "Battle of Inverkeithing", "response": ["By the morning of 20 July the English had assembled four infantry and three cavalry regiments on the north shore of the Forth.
