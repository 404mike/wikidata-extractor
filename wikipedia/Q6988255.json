However, he spent two months on the substitute bench, due to manager Ronnie Moore's decision to \"inject greater defensive discipline into the midfield\". His handful of reserve appearances led Moore to recall him to the first team. It wasn't until on 24 October 2008 when Barnett made his first team appearances for the first time in two months, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2\u20130 win over Crewe Alexandra. He then appeared in a handful of first team appearances for the side. He scored his first goal with a volley in the 1\u20131 draw to Peterborough United on 17 February 2009. Barnett later scored two more goals later in the season, scoring a vital goal in the derby against Oldham Athletic, when he volleyed in the opening goal of the game in the 2\u20130 win for Tranmere Rovers on 21 March 2009, and adding his third goal at home to Hereford United in Tranmere's 2\u20131 win on 13 April 2009. For his performance, he was named the club's Young player of the season. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, Barnett went on to make thirty\u2013three appearances and scoring three times in all competitions. On 17 July 2009, he signed a new one-year contract at Tranmere Rovers, ending speculation over a potential transfer move. However, in the 2009\u201310 season, he found himself out of the first team, due to a groin injury and appeared in the substitute bench. As a result, Barnett played in the club's reserve for the side. His first appearance of the season came on 25 August 2009, coming on as a substitute in the 65th minutes, in a 1\u20130 loss against Bolton Wanderers in the second round of the League Cup. However, he received a straight red card for \"a lunge on Neil Austin\", in a 1\u20130 loss against Hartlepool United on 24 October 2009. After being suspended for three matches, Barnett scored on his return, in a 2\u20131 loss against Leyton Orient on 21 November 2009. Following this, he spent the rest of the season on the substitute bench and only made four more appearances for the side. At the end of the 2009\u201310 season, where Barnett made nine appearances and scoring once for the side, he was released by the club."]}]}}
