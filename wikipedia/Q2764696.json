Finland's effective military strength should therefore be maintained\". Vereker also suggested that British naval forces enter the Baltic Sea to occupy the Swedish island of F\u00e5r\u00f6 to establish a naval base to support Finland, a suggestion that was immediately shot down in London at a meeting on 21 March 1940 under the grounds that if British forces entered the Baltic, Germany would occupy Denmark and mine the Danish straits that linked the Baltic to the North Sea, thereby cutting them off. Laurence Collier, the head of Northern Department of the Foreign Office rejected Vereker's plan to supply arms to Finland, stating he \"doubted whether the Germans will give allow the Russians to give us a fresh opportunity for intervention in Scandinavia\" and was against shipping arms to Finland on the \"off-chance of this happening\".\u00a0"]}]}}
