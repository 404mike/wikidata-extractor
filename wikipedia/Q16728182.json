It featured five irreverent, \"slightly bonkers\" films which explored unusual and neglected aspects of the built environment: informal plotland dwellings along the Severn Valley, nautical culture around the Solent and architectural forms associated with utopianism, bohemians and the military. Each episode was introduced by Meades as being \"devoted to the proposition that the exotic begins at home.\" The series was influenced by the work of architectural critic Ian Nairn and French New Wave film director Alain Robbe-Grillet, and it cemented Meades' uniquely incongruous on-screen persona: dark glasses, dark suits, inscrutable, didactic delivery and dense, mordant language peppered with gags and surreal interludes. Rachel Cooke of The Guardian later described his TV persona as \"pugnacious, sardonic and seemingly super-confident\", while noting the RADA training and that it was \"not the real Jonathan Meades, who is an altogether more diffident and shy character [...] except when drunk\". The series spawned four sequels: Further Abroad (1994), Even Further Abroad (1997), Abroad Again in Britain (2005) and  Abroad Again (2007), along with several other series and stand-alone films, the majority of which have been archived on the website MeadesShrine."]}, {"page": "Naomi Wolf", "response": ["Wolf attended Yale University, receiving her Bachelor of Arts in English literature in 1984. From 1985 to 1987, she was a Rhodes Scholar at New College, Oxford. Wolf's initial period at Oxford University was difficult as she experienced \"raw sexism, overt snobbery and casual antisemitism\". Her writing became so personal and subjective that her tutor advised against submitting her doctoral thesis. Wolf told interviewer Rachel Cooke, writing for The Observer, in 2019: \"My subject didn't exist. I wanted to write feminist theory, and I kept being told by the dons there was no such thing.\" Her writing at this time formed the basis of her first book, The Beauty Myth."]}, {"page": "Marillion", "response": ["Rachel Cooke, a writer for The Observer and New Statesman, has repeatedly referred negatively to the band and insulted their fans in her articles."]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["*Rachel Cooke"]}, {"page": "Nancy Mitford", "response": ["Mitford had no training as a writer or journalist; her style, particularly in the pre-war novels, is chatty and informal, much as in her letters. She may have inherited some of her natural wit and sharpness of expression from her maternal grandfather Thomas Bowles, who in his youth during the Franco-Prussian War had provided dispatches which Acton describes as \"extremely graphic and amusing\".Acton, p. 26 Mitford's fiction, based on upper-class family life and mores, belongs to the genre of the comedy of manners. Her protagonists\u2014typically, intelligent women surrounded by eccentric characters determined to find life amusing\u2014are broadly autobiographical.Blain et al, p. 747Drabble (ed.), p. 657 It is unsurprising, says Thompson, that Mitford should first attempt to write a novel in the early 1930s, since many of her friends were doing the same thing. What is surprising, Thompson adds, is the ease with which she found a publisher for this first book. Perhaps, says Thompson, her publishers Thornton Butterworth \"liked the idea of this pretty, well-connected girl who wrote in the style du jour\". Mitford was later embarrassed by her prewar novels; Rachel Cooke, writing on their reissue in 2011, believes she had no reason to be: \"There is a special kind of energy here, and its engine is the admirable and irresistible commitment of a writer who would rather die than be boring\"."]}, {"page": "The Observer", "response": ["* \"Interviewer of the Year\" (Lynn Barber, 2001; Sean O'Hagan, 2002; Rachel Cooke, 2005; Chrissy Iley (freelance for Observer and Sunday Times magazine), 2007)"]}, {"page": "The New York Review of Books", "response": ["The Washington Post called the 2013 50th Anniversary issue \"gaudy with intellectual firepower.

This was ostensibly an economy measure although Gibbons, in later life, suspected other reasons, particularly the increasing distraction from work that arose from her relationship with  Walter Beck. The engagement had ended painfully in 1928, primarily because Gibbons was looking for a fully committed relationship whereas he wanted something  more open. Her biographer and nephew, Reggie Oliver, believes Gibbons never entirely got over Beck, even after 1929 when she met Allan Webb, her future husband.Oliver, pp. 68 and 77 She was not unemployed for long; she quickly accepted a job offer as an editorial assistant at the women's magazine, The Lady. Here, according to The Observer writer Rachel Cooke, \"she applied her versatility as a writer to every subject under the sun bar cookery, which was the province of a certain Mrs Peel.\" At the same time she began work on the novel that would become Cold Comfort Farm; her colleague and friend Elizabeth Coxhead recorded that Gibbons \"neglected her duties disgracefully\" to work on this project.Coxhead in a 1975 letter, reported in Oliver, p. 91", "Truss highlights the importance that Gibbons places on detachment as a necessary adjunct to effective writing: \"Like many a good doctor, she seems to have considered sympathy a peculiar and  redundant emotion, and a terrible waste of time.\" This matter-of-fact quality in her prose might, according to Gibbons's Guardian obituarist Richard Boston, be a reaction against the turbulent and sometimes violent emotions that she witnessed within her own family who, she said, \"were all madly highly-sexed, like the Starkadders\". It is, observed Neville, an irony that the overheated   melodrama  that Gibbons most disliked was at the heart of her one great  success;  Gibbons's writings on everyday life brought her restrained approval, but no noticeable literary recognition. Nevertheless, her straightforward, style, unadorned except in parody, is admired by Rachel Cooke, who praises her as \"a sworn enemy of the flatulent, the pompous and the excessively sentimental.\" While short of sentimentality, Gibbons's writing, in prose or verse, did not lack sensitivity. She had what one analyst described as \"a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable\".Schleuter and Schleuter (eds), pp. 190\u201391"]}, {"page": "Louise Bourgeois", "response": ["*'My art is a form of restoration', interview with Rachel Cooke for The Observer, 14 October 2007"]}, {"page": "Yvonne Ridley", "response": ["Yvonne Ridley (born 23 April 1958) is a British journalist who was a chair of the National Council of the now-defunct Respect Party.
