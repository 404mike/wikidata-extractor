It had become independent of any political party, but she wanted it to become an explicitly socialist organisation tackling wider issues than women's suffrage, and aligned with the Independent Labour Party. She had a close personal relationship with the Labour politician Keir Hardie. On 1 November 1913, Pankhurst showed her support in the Dublin Lockout and spoke at a meeting in London. The members of the WSPU, particularly her sister Christabel, did not agree with her actions, and consequently expelled her from the union. Her expulsion led to her founding of the East London Federation of Suffragettes in 1914 which over the years evolved politically and changed its name accordingly, first to the Women's Suffrage Federation and then to the Workers' Socialist Federation. She founded the newspaper of the WSF, Women's Dreadnought, and employed Mary Phillips to write for it, this subsequently became the Workers' Dreadnought. The federation campaigned against the First World War, and some of its members hid conscientious objectors from the police."]}, {"page": "Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence", "response": ["Pethick-Lawrence was a member of the Suffrage Society and was introduced to Emmeline Pankhurst in 1906.

Pethick-Lawrence attended a number of events with Pankhurst including the aborted visit to the Prime Minister in late June 1908,  along with Jessie Stephenson, Florence Haig, Maud Joachim and Mary Phillips after which there was some violent treatment of women protestors, and a number of arrests."]}, {"page": "Mary Phillips", "response": ["Mary Phillips may refer to:", "* Mary Phillips (suffragette) (1880\u20131969), English suffragette, feminist and socialist"]}, {"page": "Flora Drummond", "response": ["When Mary Phillips, who had worked in Glasgow WSPU, was released from prison after serving the longest (3 month) sentence she was welcomed by Flora Drummond, with bagpipes and other suffragettes who posed in tartan  for a picture under the slogan \"Ye Mauna Tramp on the Scotch Thistle Laddie\". The Scottish suffragettes present compared their struggle to the campaign of William Wallace. Drummond also welcomed Catherine Corbett and others released from hunger strike at Dundee Gaol after riot at Winston Churchill's meeting in Dundee."]}]}}
