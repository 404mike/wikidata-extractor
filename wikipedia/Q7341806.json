The expedition consisted of two ships, the Minion and the Primrose, and was \"set out by Sir William Garrard, Sir William Chester, Mr. Thomas Lodge, Anthony Hickman, and Edward Castelin\" (members of the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London). Baker's efforts to traffic with the natives on the Guinea coast were not very successful, and he was wounded in a fight. But he returned home in safety early in 1563. In November of the same year he made a second voyage to \"Guinie and the river of Sesto\" as factor in an expedition of two ships, the John Baptist and the Merlin, sent out by the same London Merchant Adventurers. On arriving in Guinea, Baker landed with eight companions to negotiate with the natives, but a storm drove the ships from their moorings, and Baker and his companions were abandoned. After suffering much privation six of the nine men died. The three survivors were rescued by a French ship, and imprisoned in France as prisoners of war; but they appear to have been subsequently released.\nBaker wrote an account in verse of both voyages. It was printed by Richard Hakluyt in the first edition of his Voyages in 1589, but was not included in the second edition, with the result that it was 'long overlooked in studies of the period'.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Baker", "response": ["Robert Baker may refer to:", "* Robert Baker (actor) (born 1979), American actor known from Grey's Anatomy and Out of Time", "* Robert Baker (cricketer) (1849\u20131896), British player for Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "* Robert Baker (gridiron football) (born 1976), former American professional football player in the US and Canada", "* Robert Baker (ice hockey) (1926\u20132012), American ice hockey player", "* Robert Baker (New York politician) (1862\u20131943), U.S. Representative from New York (1903\u20131905)", "* Robert Baker (explorer), English voyager to Guinea in 1562\u20131563", "* Robert Baker (scientist) (1938\u20132004), English metallurgist and steelmaker", "* Robert Baker (gunsmith), allegedly invented Daniel Boone's gun, the Long Rifle", "* Robert Baker Aitken (1917\u20132010), American Zen teacher", "* James Robert Baker (1947\u20131997), American author", "* Robert Baker Girdlestone (1836\u20131923), English priest, scholar, and first principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford"]}, {"page": "Thomas Lodge (Lord Mayor of London)", "response": ["In November 1563, under the same sponsors (including Lodge), the Merlin and the John Baptist of London set off with Robert Baker as principal factor, as he had been with the Primrose and Minion.
