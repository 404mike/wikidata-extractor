Their first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs. When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961, he polished up their image and later secured them a recording contract with EMI.; . The group's first single, \"Love Me Do\", peaked at number 17 on the Record Retailer chart, and by the time their debut album, Please Please Me, was released in early 1963, Beatlemania had arrived.; . Often serious and focused while on stage with the band, Harrison was known as \"the quiet Beatle\". That moniker arose when the Beatles arrived in the United States in early 1964, and Harrison was ill with a case of Strep throat and a fever and was medically advised to limit speaking as much as possible until he performed on The Ed Sullivan Show as scheduled. As such, the press noticed Harrison's apparent laconic nature in public appearances on that tour and the subsequent nickname stuck, much to Harrison's amusement. He had two lead vocal credits on the LP, including the Lennon\u2013McCartney song \"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\", and three on their second album, With the Beatles (1963). The latter included \"Don't Bother Me\", Harrison's first solo writing credit."]}, {"page": "Pete Best", "response": ["In 1960, Allan Williams, the Beatles' manager, arranged a season of bookings in Hamburg, starting on 17 August 1960, but complained that they did not impress him, and hoped that he could find a better act."]}, {"page": "The Beatles", "response": ["Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg.

Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes: \"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the red-light area comes to life\u00a0... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\""]}, {"page": "Stu Sutcliffe", "response": ["In July 1960, the Sunday newspaper The People ran an article entitled \"The Beatnik Horror\" that featured a photograph taken in the flat below Sutcliffe's of a teenaged Lennon lying on the floor, with Sutcliffe standing by a window. As they had often visited the Jacaranda club, its owner, Allan Williams, arranged for the photograph to be taken, subsequently taking over from Sutcliffe to book concerts for the group: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe. The Beatles' subsequent name change came during an afternoon in the Renshaw Hall bar when Sutcliffe, Lennon, and Lennon's girlfriend, Cynthia Powell, thought up names similar to Holly's band, the Crickets, and came up with Beetles. Lennon later changed the name because he thought it sounded French, suggesting Le Beat or Beat-less.", "The cause of Sutcliffe's aneurysm is unknown, although it may have been started by an earlier head injury, as he was either kicked in the head, or thrown, head first, against a brick wall during an attack outside Lathom Hall, after a performance in January 1961. According to booking agent Allan Williams, Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe's aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety.

After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller.
