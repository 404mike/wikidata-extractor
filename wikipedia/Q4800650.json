Augustine's Trinitarian structural definition of the image of God includes memory, intellect, and will. According to Augustine, \"will [\u2026] unites those things which are held in the memory with those things which are thence impressed on the mind's eye in conception.\"Augustine. \"De Trinitatae.\" Translated by Arthur West Haddan. From \"Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, First Series, Vol. 3.\" Edited by Philip Schaff. Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1887, XIII.26 Augustine believed that, since humanity reflects the nature of God, humanity must also reflect the Triune nature of God. Augustine's descriptions of memory, intellect, and will held a dominant theological foothold for a number of centuries in the development of Christian Theology."]}, {"page": "De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae", "response": ["Gildas's treatise was first published in 1525 by Polydore Vergil, but with many avowed alterations and omissions. In 1568 John Joscelyn, secretary to Archbishop Parker, issued a new edition of it more in conformity with manuscript authority; and in 1691 a still more carefully revised edition by Thomas Gale appeared at Oxford. It was frequently reprinted on the Continent during the 16th century, and once or twice since. The next English edition, described by August Potthast as editio pessima, was that published by the English Historical Society in 1838, and edited by the Rev. J. Stevenson. The text of Gildas founded on Gale's edition collated with two other manuscripts, with elaborate introductions, is included in the Monumenta Historica Britannica. Another edition is in Arthur West Haddan and William Stubbs, Councils and ecclesiastical documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland (Oxford, 1869); the latest edition is that by Mommsen in Monumenta Germaniae Historica auct. antiq. xiii. (Chronica min. iii.), 1898. The text as it is used today is thus a scholarly reconstruction; the prime witness and possibly the entire manuscript stemma may not actually preserve the original page order of the autograph.Rosenbaum, S. \"Evidence of Transmission Errors Affecting the Text of Gildas's De Excidio\" in Peritia Journal of the Medieval Academy of Ireland, Volume 31 (2021)"]}, {"page": "Councils of Clovesho", "response": ["The strongest candidate for the location of Clovesho has long been Brixworth in Northamptonshire, where the surviving Anglo-Saxon church of All Saints' Church, Brixworth is indicative of the importance of the settlement during the Anglo-Saxon period.R.
