In addition to the show's national awards, local awards are also given to sexually oriented businesses and dancers in the Tampa Bay Area. Two awards are given for each national category: one which is chosen by fans and the other one which is chosen by the editors of NightMoves magazine. An online voting ballot is available for approximately three months every year for the fan's choice awards. Recipients of the editor's choice awards are chosen based on film reviews.The awards have been held at several different venues throughout the Tampa Bay Area, including The Krush in Tampa in 1995, and 1996, Club XS in Downtown Tampa in 1997, 1998, and 1999, Stormin's Palace in Clearwater in 2000, 2001, and 2004, the Pinellas Expo Center in Pinellas Park in 2002, club Twilight in Tampa in 2003, Bricktown 54 in Clearwater in 2005, 2006, and 2007, the Dallas Bull in Tampa in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, and the Tampa Gold Club in 2013, 2014, and 2015.
