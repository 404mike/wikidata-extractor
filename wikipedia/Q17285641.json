It was a remarkable contest. When Sir Philip Musgrave, 8th Baronet (1794\u20131827), the Tory candidate, ventured into one of the poorest districts of the city, he was confronted by a group of non-electors seeking his opinions relating to the Corn Laws. When his views failed to meet with their approval he received a storm of abuse followed by a shower of stones, and a general disturbance ensued. Members of the corporation and the constabulary were man-handled and thrown into the Milldam.

The mob received the troops with a volley of stones, the troops reacted with a hail of ball cartridges and when the smoke cleared two young women lay dead and numerous others lay wounded.Carlisle Journal, 26 October 1861"]}, {"page": "Musgrave baronets", "response": ["*Sir Philip Musgrave, 8th Baronet (1794\u20131827)"]}, {"page": "Philip Musgrave", "response": ["*Sir Philip Musgrave, 8th Baronet (1794\u20131827), MP for Petersfield and Carlisle"]}, {"page": "Sir Frederick Fletcher-Vane, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["* Sir Philip Musgrave, 8th Baronet, a political ally of Sir Frederick; "]}, {"page": "George Fludyer", "response": ["* Elizabeth, married in 1824 Sir Philip Musgrave, 8th Baronet, who died in 1827."]}]}}
