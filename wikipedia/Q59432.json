Back in League One an away trip to Swindon Town ended in a 0\u20130 stalemate, but it was a result that allowed United to climb into the automatic promotion places for the first time in the season. A few days later vice-captain Neill Collins extended his current contract by a further two years until Summer 2015 with the option of another year, before the Blades unbeaten run finally came to an end as they conceded a controversial last minute penalty to lose 1\u20130 away at Milton Keynes Dons.

A few days later it was announced that Danny Wilson had been named League One Manager of the Month and that George Long had won League One Player of the Month for October. Later the same day, Dave Kitson extended his contract until the end of the season with the option of another year; Kitson stated that \"It wouldn't have sat comfortably with me to leave a job half done after integrating myself into a great squad\". At the end of a busy week free agent and former Wales national goalkeeper Danny Coyne signed a 28-day deal as cover for George Long as third choice keeper George Willis had sustained a minor injury preventing him from playing. Seven days after the disappointing defeat at MK Dons, United returned to winning ways in emphatic style, convincingly beating promotion rivals Stevenage 4\u20131 at Bramall Lane, thanks in part to a brace from Shaun Miller who was making his first league start for United. A mid-week home fixture against Crewe Alexandra followed which ended in a 3\u20133 draw, despite United having taken a two-goal lead in the first half.
