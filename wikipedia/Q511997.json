He began his career at Manchester United but failed to break into the first team and was sold to Belgian club Standard Li\u00e8ge, where he spent a year before returning to England with Tottenham Hotspur. After another season, he was sold to Crystal Palace, but again failed to establish himself in the first team and spent time on loan at Rotherham United and Ipswich Town before he was released. He signed for Barnsley in 2017, but was again released at the end of the 2018\u201319 season and joined Swindon Town. He left Swindon after his contract expired in 2021, ultimately signing for Stockport County until the end of the 2021\u201322 season, but he left after four months.\nFryers is a youth international, having played for the England under-16, under-17 and under-19 teams.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dimitar Berbatov", "response": ["Berbatov played his first game of the 2011\u201312 season in an away match against West Bromwich Albion, coming on as a substitute replacing Danny Welbeck, a game which United won 2\u20131.

Berbatov made his first start of the season in the following game, a League Cup third round clash with rivals Leeds United. He played the full game and was required to play at centre back for the last 10 minutes; youngster Zeki Fryers picked up an injury and United had already used all three permitted substitutes. Berbatov struggled for chances on the night, but United did win the game 3\u20130. On 25 October 2011, he scored the first goal, after a neat passing build-up and also helped set up a goal for Michael Owen in a 3\u20130 win against Aldershot Town in the fourth round of the League Cup."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["As one of eight English clubs who qualified for European competition in the 2010\u201311 season, United received a bye to the Third Round of the League Cup.

Ryan Giggs all but sealed the victory when he played a short corner to Park Ji-sung, got the return ball, nutmegged Robert Snodgrass, and shot past Andrew Lonergan via a deflection off Luciano Becchio.
