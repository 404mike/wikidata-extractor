He was elected a Fellow of St John's College in 1937 and appointed a lecturer in mathematics in the same year (until 1959). A keen amateur cricketer, he played minor counties cricket for Cambridgeshire from 1946\u20131949, making fifteen appearances. He was Reader in Theoretical Astronomy from 1959 to 1969, after which he was appointed to a specially created professorship in the subject.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955. His application citation read: \"Distinguished for his work in astronomy. Author of numerous papers on the origin and early history of the Solar System, notably his modifications of the collision theory. Showed from work of Cartan that fission of a planet by rotation would give two independent bodies, and consequently that the fission theory of binary stars is untenable (The Stability of Rotating Liquid Masses, 1953). Author (with F. Hoyle) of numerous papers on the astronomical effects of accretion, and (with H. Bondi) of two on the transmission of the tidal friction couple to the Earth's core and on the behaviour of the core during precessions. Author of a striking new theory of comets. (The Comets and their Origin, 1953) He won the Royal Society Royal Medal in 1965 \"In recognition of his distinguished contributions to astronomy, particularly for his work on the dynamical stability of galaxies.\"\nHe wrote a number of books: The Comets and Their Origin (1953), The Stability of Rotating Liquid Masses (1953), The Modern Universe {1956},  Rival Theories of Cosmology {1960},  Man's View of the Universe (1961), Mysteries of the Solar System (1968),  The Earth and its Mountains (1982), The Gold Effect (1990). In 1956, he presented a 5-part television series on the B.B.C. entitled \"The Modern Universe\"\nHe had married Meave Hobden in Poole in 1939.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hermann Bondi", "response": ["Bondi was one of the first to correctly appreciate the nature of gravitational radiation, introducing Bondi radiation coordinates, the Bondi k-calculus, the notions of Bondi mass and Bondi news, and writing review articles. He popularized the sticky bead argument which was said to be originally due, anonymously, to Richard Feynman, for the claim that physically meaningful gravitational radiation is indeed predicted by general relativity, an assertion which was controversial up until about 1955. A 1947 paper revived interest in the Lema\u00eetre\u2013Tolman metric, an inhomogeneous, spherically symmetric dust solution (often called the LTB or Lema\u00eetre\u2013Tolman\u2013Bondi metric). Bondi also contributed to the theory of accretion of matter from a cloud of gas onto a star or a black hole, working with Raymond Lyttleton and giving his name to \"Bondi accretion\" and the \"Bondi radius\"."]}, {"page": "King Edward VI Five Ways School", "response": ["* Prof Raymond Lyttleton FRS, Professor of Theoretical Astronomy from 1969\u201378 at the University of Cambridge, presenter in 1956 of the BBC's The Modern Universe (a precursor to The Sky at Night, with the same theme music  - Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande by Sibelius)"]}, {"page": "Raymond Arthur Lyttleton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Raymond Lyttleton"]}, {"page": "R.A.

Such a scenario had already been suggested and rejected by Henry Russell in 1935, though it may have been more likely assuming the Sun was born in an open cluster, where stellar collisions are common. Lyttleton showed that terrestrial planets were too small to condense on their own and suggested that one very large proto-planet broke in two because of rotational instability, forming Jupiter and Saturn, with a connecting filament from which the other planets formed. A later model, from 1940 and 1941, involved a triple star system, a binary plus the Sun, in which the binary merged and later split because of rotational instability and escaped from the system, leaving a filament that formed between them to be captured by the Sun. Objections of Lyman Spitzer apply to this model also."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1955", "response": ["#Raymond Lyttleton"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of St John's College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Raymond Lyttleton"]}, {"page": "Jane Eliza Procter Fellowship", "response": ["*  Raymond Lyttleton, mathematician."]}, {"page": "Ray Lyttleton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Raymond Lyttleton"]}]}}
