Returning to London and beginning to study for the Bar, he finally found playwriting success in burlesques and other punny plays.  In the 1860s, he became an editor of humorous magazines and a noted man-about-town, while continuing to build his playwriting reputation, notably as co-manager, with Marie Wilton, of the Prince of Wales's Theatre.  In 1869, he returned to the stage as an actor and, during the same period, wrote numerous successful plays, including the historic international success, Our Boys.  In his last years, he grew frail from tuberculosis and died at the age of 49.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
