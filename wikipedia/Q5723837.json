Returning to London and beginning to study for the Bar, he finally found playwriting success in burlesques and other punny plays.  In the 1860s, he became an editor of humorous magazines and a noted man-about-town, while continuing to build his playwriting reputation, notably as co-manager, with Marie Wilton, of the Prince of Wales's Theatre.  In 1869, he returned to the stage as an actor and, during the same period, wrote numerous successful plays, including the historic international success, Our Boys.  In his last years, he grew frail from tuberculosis and died at the age of 49.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Our American Cousin", "response": ["It was not long before the success of this play inspired an imitation, Charles Gayler's Our Female American Cousin, which opened in New York City in January 1859.

Two writers who helped to elevate the importance and popularity of the fairy-tale portion of the pantomime were James Planch\u00e9 and Henry James Byron. They emphasized puns and humorous word play, a tradition that continues in pantomime today. As manager of Drury Lane in the 1870s, Augustus Harris wrote a series of extraordinarily popular pantomimes, focusing on the spectacle of the productions, that pushed this transition by emphasizing comic business in the pantomime opening and grand processionals.Mayer, p. 324 By the end of the 19th century, the harlequinade had become merely a brief epilogue to the pantomime, dwindling into a brief display of dancing and acrobatics.Crowther, Andrew. \"Clown and Harlequin\", W.
