He went on to make 76 appearances over the next three years, amid competition from Grenville Millington, Mike Salmon, Billy O'Rourke and John Butcher. Harrington was first\u2013choice goalkeeper at Chester by the end of 1982\u201383, but an injury in the penultimate game of the season at Torquay United prematurely ended his campaign and led to defender Noel Bradley having to deputise for him. But Harrington recovered in time for one of his most memorable games for Chester in a League Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers in September 1983, when he saved the first three Bolton penalties in the penalty shoot-out to give Chester victory. This season saw him miss just five games for Chester, but unfortunately the campaign ended with the club finishing bottom of The Football League."]}, {"page": "Gary Talbot", "response": ["Talbot then opted to retire from professional football, with his final game being a 2\u20130 win over Lincoln City in April 1969.

Talbot left as Chester's record Football League goalscorer (previously held by Frank Wrightson) with 83 goals, and it was not until September 1992 that Stuart Rimmer would pass the total."]}, {"page": "Brian Lloyd", "response": ["In September 1977, Lloyd made a surprise \u00a36,000 move to local rivals Chester. He quickly replaced fellow Welshman Grenville Millington as the regular Chester goalkeeper and helped Alan Oakes's \"Seals\" to finish fifth in the Third Division in 1977\u201378, with Lloyd being named as the club's player of the season for his efforts. He was again first-choice the following season but an injury in September 1979 led to Millington replacing Lloyd in the Chester goal. With Millington now the regular in goal and youngster Phil Harrington emerging from the youth ranks, Lloyd was allowed to join Port Vale on loan in February 1981. He played Vale's remaining sixteen matches of the season. Vale supporters and players alike appealed to manager John McGrath to sign him on permanently at Vale Park, but to no avail, he returned to Sealand Road and was subsequently released."]}, {"page": "Nigel Edwards (footballer)", "response": ["Born Wrexham, Edwards was signed by Chester as a youngster in September 1968 after being at Blackburn Rovers on amateur terms.

He played in the opening 18 games of the following season, but the signing of Grenville Millington led to Taylor losing his place and he managed just five more league starts. In the 1974\u201375 season (when Chester won promotion from the Football League Fourth Division and reached the semi\u2013finals of the Football League Cup), Taylor was restricted to a solitary Welsh Cup outing against Oswestry Town as he brought his Chester career to a close.
