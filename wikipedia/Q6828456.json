He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler  who played for Durham between 2001 and 2003. He was born in Darlington.\nHatch's Second XI career began in 1998, a season in which he played two matches for Durham, taking two wickets in his first. He continued in the Second XI for nearly three years before making the step up to first-class cricket, where he debuted in June 2001. Though he took three wickets on his debut, he also achieved a golden duck in a defeat did nothing to aid Durham's final season placing of eighth in the Division Two table.\nThanks to his tailending position and high batting average, Hatch finished not out in eight of the sixteen innings he played during his debut first-class season. During 2002 he played very infrequently, as Durham finished rock bottom of Division Two, though they slightly improved their position in the following season.\nHatch exited the first-class game in 2003. Hatch later played for the Second XI teams of Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Essex. Hatch was a tailending batsman and a moderately successful bowler in both the long and short form of the game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barnard Castle School", "response": ["* Nicholas Hatch, former first class cricketer with Durham."]}, {"page": "Nicky Hatch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas Hatch"]}, {"page": "List of Durham County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Nicholas Hatch (2001\u20132003) : N.
