His art was enriched by his regard for the French Post-Impressionists masters such as Matisse, Gauguin, Picasso, Braque, Chagall and Redon, painterly and richly coloured in a long-standing Scottish tradition. Always informed by an intellectual rigour and reference to the wider history of art, literature and music, it is generally celebratory of the good things in life and nature."]}, {"page": "James Cowie (artist)", "response": ["Cowie held his first solo exhibition at the McLellan Galleries in Glasgow in 1935 and the same year he took the post of Head of Painting at Gray's School of Art. In 1937 Cowie became the warden of the Patrick Allan Fraser School of Art at Hospitalfield House. Cowie produced some of his finest work at Hospitalfield and also taught at the annual summer school there. He painted a number of group portraits of the other artists and students at Hospitalfield. Among his pupils were Robert Colquhoun, Robert MacBryde, Robert Henderson Blyth and Joan Eardley. In October 1941 Cowie was commissioned by the War Artists' Advisory Committee to produce a portrait of a Scottish Civil Defence worker. During the conflict he also ran a drawing class at a local Royal Navy base."]}, {"page": "Robert Blyth", "response": ["* Robert Henderson Blyth (1919\u20131970), Scottish landscape painter and artist"]}]}}
