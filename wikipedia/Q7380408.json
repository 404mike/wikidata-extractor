In his later novels such as the experimental gothic novel O, he employs a genre he calls Vachitarvaad, which encompasses science fiction, fantasy, horror and magical realism."]}, {"page": "Baar di Boli", "response": ["Their children speak Punjabi as a second language and have codified it to the grammatical patterns of English. This has resulted in a language often referred to as Hinglish, Pinglish or Punglish. Punjabis settled in the west are known as Vilayties, and some refer to Baar Di Boli as Vilayti ( see below). However this is a term that is used by academics in Punjab to describe the Diaspora's version of Punjabi. In reality most Occidental Punjabis do see it as Punjabi. However the differences are apparent when one reads Western Punjabi novels such as Neela Noor by Rupinderpal Singh Dhillon, or listens to Bhangra mixes by DCS and Bally Sagoo."]}, {"page": "List of Punjabi people", "response": ["* Rupinderpal Singh Dhillon"]}, {"page": "Punjabi literature", "response": ["Punjabi diaspora literature has developed through writers in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the United States, as well as writers in Africa such as Ajaib Kamal, born in 1932 in Kenya, and Mazhar Tirmazi, writer of famous song \"Umraan Langhiyan Pabhan Bhaar.\" Themes explored by diaspora writers include the cross-cultural experience of Punjabi migrants, racial discrimination, exclusion, and assimilation, the experience of women in the diaspora, and spirituality in the modern world.
