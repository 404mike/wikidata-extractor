He was a personal assistant to Edward Heath in the 1966 general election.\nHe was elected the MP for Ripon in February 1974, a seat that the Liberals had gained in a by-election the previous year. The constituency was abolished for the 1983 general election, and Hampson was then elected for Leeds North West. Hampson was PPS to Michael Heseltine, then Defence Secretary, when he was involved in a May 1984 incident in a gay theatre club in Soho where Hampson \"accidentally brushed\" the thigh of an undercover police officer. Although the court case against him was dropped, Hampson was forced to resign as PPS. In 1990, with Michael Mates, Hampson ran Heseltine's Conservative Party leadership campaign. At the 1997 general election he was defeated by Labour candidate Harold Best.\nHampson married former fashion model Frances Pauline Einhorn in May 1975, but she was killed whilst passenger in a car accident on 11 September that year aged 29. The driver was over twice over the drunk drive limit.\"Person Page\".</ref> Hampson married Susan Cameron in 1979.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["Heseltine's book Where There's A Will was written by a team of ghostwriters directed by Keith Hampson and Julian Haviland (former political editor of ITN and The Times). Academics, businessmen and economists contributed, and he often had them thresh out ideas in front of him. \"He acquires by social intercourse the knowledge that other people acquire by reading\", one adviser commented. The collated drafts were then rewritten by Haviland to \"give it one voice\". Hugo Young called it \"the most impressive [book of its kind] I've read by a modern Conservative\".Crick 1997, pp. 302\u20135.", "One of the reasons which Thatcher gave to close confidants for not retiring on her tenth anniversary as Prime Minister (May 1989) was worry that Heseltine would defeat Geoffrey Howe in any subsequent leadership election. Opinion polls showed that Heseltine would boost Conservative support by 13 percentage points \u2013 enough to overtake Labour. Sir Anthony Meyer wanted to see Heseltine as leader and only went ahead with his December 1989 leadership challenge to Thatcher on being assured by Keith Hampson that it would not damage Heseltine's chances; in the event Heseltine apparently walked up and down the corridor outside the voting booth making clear that he was abstaining.Crick 1997, pp. 315\u20136. While Thatcher won the contest, winning the votes of 85% of Conservative MPs,  the next day's Glasgow Herald reported that  Heseltine's supporters predicted that unless she changed \"her style of leadership\", she would \"be on her way out next year\".", "In mid-1995 Major challenged his critics to \"put up or shut up\" by resubmitting himself to a leadership election in which he was unsuccessfully opposed by John Redwood the Secretary of State for Wales. There was speculation that Heseltine's supporters would engineer Major's downfall in the hope that their man would take over, but they stayed loyal to Major. Heseltine had been listening to regular reports about his potential support from his lieutenants Keith Hampson, Richard Ottaway, Michael Mates and Peter Temple-Morris, and in the event of a second ballot hoped to receive Major's endorsement. Peter Tapsell refused to support him because of the European issue. Hampson believed that Heseltine might have won, as did Philip Stephens of the Financial Times. Michael Crick does not agree, pointing out that many of Heseltine's supporters from 1990 had retired from the Commons and the 1992 intake was more right-wing and eurosceptic.Crick 1997, pp. 414\u20137."]}, {"page": "John Battle (politician)", "response": ["He was chosen to contest the Conservative seat of Leeds North West at the 1983 general election.
