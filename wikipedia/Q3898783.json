As a child she found acting an escape from an unhappy home life. After playing in amateur productions, she was taken on by a repertory company and spent nine years in various British towns, learning her craft. In 1955 she got her big break in the comic play Sailor Beware!: she created the leading role in a repertory production and, though unknown to London audiences, was given the part when the play was presented in the West End. She became known for playing domineering middle-aged women in plays, films and television shows.\nMount occasionally played in classic comedies, including works by Shakespeare, Jonson, Goldsmith and Sheridan, and she was a member of The Old Vic, National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare companies in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, respectively.\nLater in her career Mount was cast more frequently in serious parts, including the title role of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage on stage, and in several television dramas.
