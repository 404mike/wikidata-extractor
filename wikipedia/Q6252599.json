Perry (born 4 June 1952) is an English musician, songwriter, and author. He came to prominence in the mid-1970s as the guitarist for the English rock band the Only Ones.\nThe Only Ones came out of London during the first wave of punk (1976\u201377) and, rather like the New York bands the Heartbreakers and Television with whom they later toured, suffered from being too musical for lumpen-punk but too \"new\" for conservative record business sensibilities. Though they were lumped in with the new wave vanguard, the band were too musically literate - not to mention long in the tooth - to be punks. Rather they were sophisticated guitar rockers whose sound embraced all flavors of 1950s and 1960s rock. Although never a huge commercial success, the band are highly influential.Perry's guitar style is noted for a combination of attack and melody, a mixture that the UK music magazine Sounds described as being \"very superb\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Sisters of Mercy", "response": ["The next incarnation of the Sisters of Mercy featured an unknown German guitarist, Andreas Bruhn, whom Eldritch apparently discovered playing in a Hamburg pub and brought into the band in April 1989; bassist Tony James (ex-Sigue Sigue Sputnik guitarist and Generation X bassist/songwriter); and last-minute recruit Tim Bricheno, formerly of All About Eve, on guitars. The new line-up kicked off with the Vision Thing album, released in October 1990, produced by Eldritch (one song, the single \"More\", was a co-production and co-written with Steinman). The album also featured guitarist John Perry with backing vocals by Maggie Reilly.

Three years later he again teamed up with Palladin to release Copy Cats, a covers album.
