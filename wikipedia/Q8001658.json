While he spent the 1955 off-season coaching in Southern Rhodesia, Ipswich Town of the Third Division South received permission from Anderson to speak to Ramsey about signing him as player-manager. When Ramsey met the Ipswich hierarchy on his return from Africa, he refused to combine management with playing. \"I told them I would only concentrate on one job\", Ramsey later said; \"it would be impossible to play with the players I would be coaching.\" This settled, Ipswich announced Ramsey's appointment as manager on 9 August 1955.  Some of those who knew Ramsey had strong opinions about how he would manage. Wilf Grant, a former Southampton teammate of Ramsey's who was now on the training staff at Ipswich, commented: \"He'll be good, but he will be the boss.\" Billy Wright, Ramsey's England teammate commented, \"In appointing Alf to become their manager Ipswich Town paid a tremendous tribute to intelligent football\u2014and footballers who think!\""]}, {"page": "Grant (surname)", "response": ["*Wilf Grant (1920\u20131990), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Phil Joslin (footballer)", "response": ["He returned to Torquay following the end of the war before signing for Cardiff City, who had first refusal on Torquay players at the time, in 1948 and kept fifteen clean sheets in thirty-eight league appearances in his first season.

A number of clubs were interested at the time, including his home town club Swansea Town, but he signed a contract with Cardiff in February 1949. Despite suffering numerous small injuries during his seven years at the club, he quickly became a regular in the side providing numerous chances for the club's prolific striker Wilf Grant to score 26 goals during the 1951\u201352 season. His injuries meant he never played a full season for the club and in 1956 he was allowed to leave and join Northampton Town.
