Born in Clitheroe, Lancashire, England, he was raised in Northern Ireland. His plays have been performed throughout the world, including Ireland, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Australia. He collaborated with, amongst others, Sir John Tavener, Sir Tyrone Guthrie, and Lord Olivier. He had a long-standing creative relationship with theatre director Braham Murray who directed all his work from 1967 to 1993 at the Century Theatre, the 69 Theatre Company and then the Royal Exchange in Manchester.\nMcLarnon was survived by his wife, actress Eileen Essell, whom he wed in 1958; they had one child, a son, Fergus.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1997 in literature", "response": ["*August 16 \u2013 Gerard McLarnon, Irish actor and playwright (born 1915)"]}, {"page": "John Tavener", "response": ["Tavener first came to prominence in 1968 with his dramatic cantata The Whale, based on the Old Testament story of Jonah. It was premi\u00e8red at the London Sinfonietta's d\u00e9but concert, which was also the opening concert of the Queen Elizabeth Hall.Michael White, \"A Time for Reflection\", BBC Music Magazine, Vol. 22 No. 2 (December 2013), p. 28. Tavener's younger brother, Roger, was then doing some building work on Ringo Starr's home and, gaining the musician's interest, persuaded the Beatles to have The Whale recorded by Apple Records and released in 1970. The following year Tavener began teaching at Trinity College of Music, London. Other works by Tavener released by Apple included his A Celtic Requiem, which impressed Benjamin Britten enough to persuade Covent Garden to commission an opera from Tavener. The ultimate result, to a libretto by playwright Gerard McLarnon, was Th\u00e9r\u00e8se: when staged in 1979 the opera was thought too static to be a successful drama."]}, {"page": "Philip Madoc", "response": ["* Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov in The Brothers Karamazov adapted by Gerard McLarnon.
