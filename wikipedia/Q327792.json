He won the British Boys Championship in 1996 and made his first appearance in a European Tour event that year as an invitee at his local event, the Slaley Hall Northumberland Challenge. He attended Midland College in Texas, United States, where he was a two time NJCAA All-American.\nFerrie turned professional in 1999. He began his career on the second tier Challenge Tour in 2000, claiming his first win at the Tessali Open del Sud. He was successful at the 2000 qualifying school, earning the right to play on the European Tour, but he initially struggled at that level, although he continued to have success on the Challenge Tour capturing his second title at the Challenge Total Fina Elf. At the end of the season he had to return to the qualifying school to retain his tour card for 2002.\nIn 2002, Ferrie just did enough to retain his playing status on the European Tour, ending the season in 112th place on the Order of Merit, thanks largely to finishing tied for 3rd in the Novotel Perrier Open de France. The following season, Ferrie won for the first time on the European Tour at the Canarias Open de Espana, securing his place on tour for two years. In 2005 he came from behind to win the Smurfit European Open, one of the leading tournaments in Europe, and went on to finish the season a career best 11th on the Order of Merit, with the win also giving him a five-year exemption on the tour.In the 2006 U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Ferrie held the sole lead for part of the third round before ending it tied at the top of the leaderboard with Phil Mickelson. He was unable to maintain his challenge and recorded a final round 76 to slip back into a tie for sixth, three strokes behind winner Geoff Ogilvy.Following an unsuccessful season on the European Tour in 2007, Ferrie played on the U.S.-based PGA Tour in 2008 having earned his card through qualifying school. However he failed to earn enough prize-money to maintain his playing rights and in 2009 returned to the European Tour. He won his third European Tour title in 2011.\nFerrie lost his full European Tour playing rights at the end of 2012 and did not complete qualifying school.\nFerrie's brother Iain is also a professional golfer, who has played on the Challenge Tour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Montgomerie", "response": ["| Kenneth Ferrie"]}, {"page": "Alfred Dunhill Links Championship", "response": ["| 2005 ||  Colin Montgomerie || align=center|279 || align=center|\u22129 || 1 stroke ||  Kenneth Ferrie || Henrik Stenson andRurik Gobel"]}, {"page": "European Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2005 ||  Kenneth Ferrie || align=center|285 || align=center|\u22123 || 2 strokes ||  Colin Montgomerie Graeme Storm || The K Club"]}, {"page": "Open de Espa\u00f1a", "response": ["| 2003 ||  Kenneth Ferrie || align=center|266 || align=center|\u221222 || Playoff ||  Peter Hedblom Peter Lawrie || align=center|291,660"]}, {"page": "2006 in golf", "response": ["* 15\u201318 June: U.S. Open - Winner: Geoff Ogilvy 15-year-old Tadd Fujikawa of Hawaii became the youngest qualifier in US Open history.Fujikawa earns a major age distinction, KRT Wire, 15 June 2006. Qualifier Madalitso Muthiya was the first Zambian to play in the U.S. Open. The tournament was played at Winged Foot for the first time since 1984. Scottish veteran Colin Montgomerie was the only man to shoot under par in round 1. After 36 holes Steve Stricker was one shot ahead of the field and the only man under par. Tiger Woods missed the first cut in a major of his professional career after posting a 12 over par total. Phil Mickelson shared the third-round lead with the 27-year-old Englishman Kenneth Ferrie, who was playing in his first U.S. Open. Mickelson led by one shot after 71 holes, but was unable to put it away on number 72.  His errant driving, which had troubled him all round, climaxed in a very poor tee shot that was almost out-of-bounds.  This was followed by several bad shot selections, leading to a double bogey 6, and a second-place finish to winner Geoff Ogilvy. First-round leader Colin Montgomerie finished T2 when he, needing only a par at hole number 72 to win, double bogeyed.
