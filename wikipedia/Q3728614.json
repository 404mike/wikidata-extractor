While there she met Mexican writer Jorge Ibarg\u00fcengoitia, whom she married in 1973. During this time her art career developed mostly in pastels with a reflective quality. In 1983, Ibarg\u00fcengoitia died in a plane crash in Spain and Laville's painting changed dramatically. Since that time, her work has focused on the loss of her husband, directly or indirectly with themes of finality, eternity and wondering what more is there. Her work has been exhibited in Mexico and abroad including the Palacio de Bellas Artes and the Museo de Arte Moderno. In 2012, she received the Bellas Artes Medal for her life's work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1923", "response": ["* September 8 \u2013 Joy Laville, English-Mexican sculptor, potter and painter (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "Morelos", "response": ["Because of the state's mild climate and Cuernavaca's cultural tradition, many Mexican and foreign artists and writers have made the state home.
