At the age of 14, he was apprenticed to Thomas Bewick, and became one of his favorite pupils. Bewick describes him as one \"who both as an engraver & designer, stands preeminent\" at his day (Memoir, p. 200). He engraved many woodblocks for Bewick's Aesop's Fables (1818).\nHarvey moved to London in 1817, studying drawing with Benjamin Haydon, and anatomy with Charles Bell. In 1821, he made a wood-engraving after Haydon in imitation of engraving, the large block of the Assassination of L. S. Dentatus. This was probably the then most ambitious woodblock which had been cut in England.\nHarvey switched to design, after the death of John Thurston, the then leading wood designer in London. One of his earliest works is his illustrations for Alexander Henderson's History of Ancient and Modern Wines in 1824.\nHis masterpieces are his illustrations to Northcote's Fables (1823\u201333) and to E. W. Lane's The Arabian Nights' Entertainments (1838\u201340).\nHarvey is buried in Richmond Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "One Thousand and One Nights", "response": ["File:Harvey W, 1001 nights (12).jpg|William Harvey, The Fifth Voyage of Es-Sindbad of the Sea, 1838\u201340, woodcut", "File:Harvey W, 1001 nights (19).jpg|William Harvey, The Story of the City of Brass, 1838\u201340, woodcut", "File:Harvey W, 1001 nights (11).jpg|William Harvey, The Story of the Two Princes El-Amjad and El-As'ad, 1838\u201340, woodcut", "File:Harvey W, 1001 nights (14).jpg|William Harvey, The Story of Abd Allah of the Land and Abd Allah of the Sea", "File:Harvey W, 1001 nights (3).jpg|William Harvey, The Story of the Fisherman, 1838\u201340, woodcut"]}, {"page": "Thomas Bewick", "response": ["His career began when he was apprenticed to engraver Ralph Beilby in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Knight also had an advantage, due to being based inside London, he had access to a number of skilled engravers such as William Harvey, John Orrin Smith and Edmund Evans among others.
