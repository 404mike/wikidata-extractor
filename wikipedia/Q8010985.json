At the age of 14, he was apprenticed to Thomas Bewick, and became one of his favorite pupils. Bewick describes him as one \"who both as an engraver & designer, stands preeminent\" at his day (Memoir, p. 200). He engraved many woodblocks for Bewick's Aesop's Fables (1818).\nHarvey moved to London in 1817, studying drawing with Benjamin Haydon, and anatomy with Charles Bell. In 1821, he made a wood-engraving after Haydon in imitation of engraving, the large block of the Assassination of L. S. Dentatus. This was probably the then most ambitious woodblock which had been cut in England.\nHarvey switched to design, after the death of John Thurston, the then leading wood designer in London. One of his earliest works is his illustrations for Alexander Henderson's History of Ancient and Modern Wines in 1824.\nHis masterpieces are his illustrations to Northcote's Fables (1823\u201333) and to E. W. Lane's The Arabian Nights' Entertainments (1838\u201340).\nHarvey is buried in Richmond Cemetery.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
