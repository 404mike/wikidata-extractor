Interviews were used to narrow down the number of applicants to four, with the winner then being chosen at a public meeting that all voters in the constituency could attend and vote in. Several rounds of voting were used; the first two rounds, with 81 votes cast in each, both eliminated one candidate; the first candidate eliminated was Paul Bristow, who was later won the seat of Peterborough in 2019. The third round saw 80 votes cast with a tie between the journalist Matt Warman and the headteacher Tim Clark. Another vote between the two was held, which was won by Warman, then the head of technology at The Daily Telegraph.
