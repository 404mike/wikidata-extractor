Because of his profession as a singer, Knox's cricket career was short, but he was undoubtedly the fastest bowler of his time and one of the fastest bowlers ever to play for England \u2013 probably capable of speeds over 150 km/h (93 mph).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1906 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Jack Crawford, Arthur Fielder, Ernie Hayes, Kenneth Hutchings, Neville Knox"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Neville Knox"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Neville Knox \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Walter Brearley", "response": ["However, having established himself as the best fast bowler in the world, at the end of the season Brearley announced that business claims would prevent him playing again. Although he changed his mind and did play five times for Lancashire in 1906 besides helping Neville Knox to form a remarkably hostile attack for the Gentlemen at Lord's, he refused to play again for his county until 1908. In 1907, Brearley only played a handful of first-class games for the Gentlemen and a couple of privately raised teams, but was still thought good enough to only just miss out on a Test place at Lord's against South Africa. 1908 saw Brearley end his dispute with the Lancashire committee and bowl superbly before business kept him out of most of the August matches. He took 148 wickets in just seventeen matches and was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden. In 1909 he was even more impressive so long as he could play, but failed in his only Test, and in the following two years business and a major accident limited him to just fourteen of Lancashire's fifty eight Championship games."]}, {"page": "Walter Lees (cricketer)", "response": ["Wisden \u2013 Walter Lees This earned Lees a Wisden Cricketer of the Year nomination in 1906, and he was chosen for a tour to South Africa. His batting remained on the same level as previous years, but he did hit a maiden century in fifty minutes against Hampshire, something he was to repeat a year later against Sussex. In 1906, though he took 168 wickets, Lees was overshadowed by the tremendous speed of Neville Knox on the dry but very true Oval pitches, but was believed by observers to be just as good as in 1905.Pardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden\u2019s Cricketers' Almanack; Forty-Fourth Edition (1907), p. 47 In a famous match for the Players, Lees put on more pace than usual and took six wickets, whilst with 51 he proved better able to play Knox and Walter Brearley than most of the recognised professional batsmen.Pardon (editor); John Wisden\u2019s Cricketers' Almanack; Forty-Fourth Edition (1907), pp. 332\u2013334"]}, {"page": "1906 English cricket season", "response": ["* Jack Crawford, Arthur Fielder, Ernie Hayes, Kenneth Hutchings, Neville Knox"]}, {"page": "N.A.

Only three batsmen reached double figures\u2014Tom Hayward, Johnny Tyldesley and George Hirst\u2014as Faulkner took six wickets for the tourists, getting prodigious turn in both directions with his spin bowling. The pitch was soft and difficult to bat on due to the rain, and after lunch nine of England's wickets were lost in under an hour. England were weakened due to their decision to pick a pace bowler, Neville Knox, over a spinner, Jack Crawford, who would have been better suited to the conditions. Accordingly, England relied on Colin Blythe, who bowled for the entire innings and collected eight wickets. Nevertheless, partially due to a number of dropped catches, South Africa scored 110 to lead by 34 runs."]}, {"page": "Marylebone Cricket Club cricket team in New Zealand in 1906\u201307", "response": ["Several notable amateurs were asked to tour but were unable to set aside the necessary six months to do so.

Taking Surrey as an example, Ernie Hayes, Bill Hitch and Andy Sandham joined the Sportsman's Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers while fast bowler Neville Knox became a private in the Public Schools Battalion.

He played regular county cricket for Somerset from 1902 until 1906, averaging 24.86 with the bat in 74 matches. Martyn's top-score in first-class cricket came in a 1905 match against the Australians, when opening the batting whilst following-on, he made an unbeaten 130. He was praised for his performance in the Gentlemen v Players match in 1906, when he was behind the wicket for fast bowlers Walter Brearley and Neville Knox.
