The photographs were taken by Emre \u00dcnal and Bahar Kongel Fransez served as the singer's stylist. She took inspiration from \"exotic women\" Carmen Miranda and Frida Kahlo for her work. The drawings on the album's cover and photographs were prepared by Pelin K\u0131rca. Naim Dilmener found the album's cover strange, and wrote in his review: \"To make it look like a painting, G\u00fcl\u015fen has used the maximum number of colors possible, then pulled her belly out and looks straight toward us. They have confused the meaning of exotic with forest-like, and interpreted forest as monkey. There are two monkeys on the cover. They have probably decided that two is enough, cause three would have turned the meaning of the cover into something else; G\u00fcl\u015fen's outfit combination is not suitable for that background either.\" After releasing the photographs, G\u00fcl\u015fen's appearance was also compared to Katy Perry's in the music video for \"Roar\". Sabah newspaper wrote in its review: \"After taking some photos with monkeys in Cuba and realizing their similarity to Perry's appearance with monkeys in the jungle, the singer decided to publish other photographs in the press.\" Some critics compared her overall appearance to English singer FKA Twigs. Actress Yasemin Allen wrote in her review for S\u00f6zc\u00fc: \"I'm against using alternative images from different genres when making a pop album. It is considered a little bit scabby by different masses of people. I still stand behind what I have said before.
