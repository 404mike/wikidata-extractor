Another phrase was \"Oh dear, how sad, never mind\", delivered in a dry, ironic manner, and used when others around him had problems. Davies and co-star Don Estelle had a number one hit in the UK with a semi-comic version of \"Whispering Grass\" in 1975. Journalist Neil Clark, contributing to The Times in 2005, described his performance as the \"definitive portrayal of a bullying and uneducated sergeant-major\" and reported Spike Milligan was of the opinion that Davies' role was \"the funniest comic performance he had ever\" watched.
