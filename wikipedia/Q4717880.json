Williams showcased the album at London's Hoxton Bar Kitchen on January 26, 2011. Livemusic interviewed Williams on the evening and made a subsequent film, produced by artist Alex Templeton-Ward. When Williams was asked what the point of poetry was, he said: \"I'm making this up, I have no idea but here we go. I think that it would be to express, to share, to relieve, to explore. For me, poetry offers some what of a cathartic experience. I am able to move through emotions and emotional experience particularly, you know, break-ups, difficulties in all the things that I may face, whether that is with an industry or a loved one or whomever, there needs to be an infiltration process, like you have a window open over there. That is the purpose of poetry: it is the window that opens, that allows some air in, some other insight, some other possibility so we can explore all that we feel, all that we think but with the space to see more than what we know, because there is so much more than we know. If I didn't open myself to the possibilities of the unknown, then I would be lost.\""]}, {"page": "Paul Hawkins (musician)", "response": ["Paul Hawkins is a London-based author and singer-songwriter who grew up near Bristol and has been a key figure in London's antifolk scene.

The source of that detail is inherent in the sounds of the guitars and the notes of those arrangements.\"Compared with the Sunn  livemusic.fm. 2010-10-28. Retrieved on 2010-10-29."]}]}}
