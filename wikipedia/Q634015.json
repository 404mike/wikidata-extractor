The band played a version of Chicago-style dixieland jazz and was part of the traditional jazz revival in England in the 1950s. In the 1960s, Welsh's band played with Earl Hines, Red Allen, Peanuts Hucko, Pee Wee Russell, and Ruby Braff."]}, {"page": "Mick Mulligan", "response": ["Mulligan's orchestra included Roy Crimmins, Ian Christie, and Archie Semple; it rivaled Humphrey Lyttelton's in popularity on the British trad jazz circuit. While he booked excellent sidemen, Mulligan was not a top-flight musician and his own playing was often hampered by intoxication; furthermore, their recording legacy is spotty because their releases were irregular and generally for small labels. Mulligan broke up his band in 1953 but reformed it a year and a half later, continuing with the new group in 1962; Melly also sang along with this ensemble. In January 1963, the British music magazine NME reported that the biggest trad jazz event to be staged in Britain had taken place at Alexandra Palace.  The event included Melly, Diz Disley, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Monty Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Alex Welsh and Mulligan."]}, {"page": "Archie semple", "response": ["#REDIRECT Archie Semple "]}, {"page": "1974 in jazz", "response": ["** Archie Semple, Scottish clarinetist (born 1928)."]}, {"page": "Roy Crimmins", "response": ["Born in London, England, of Irish and English descent, Crimmins turned professional by joining the Mick Mulligan band in 1952.
