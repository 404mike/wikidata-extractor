Shortly afterwards he received through Michael Maurice, father of [John] Frederick Denison Maurice, an invitation to become assistant to Newcome Cappe at St Saviourgate Chapel, York.  He accepted on 23 January 1792, and began his duties at York on 5 February.  In 1801 he became sole minister on Cappe's death. The chief feature of his exegetical work was his treatment of prophecy, limiting the range of its prediction, confining that of Hebrew prophecy to the age of its production, and bounding our Lord's predictions by the destruction of Jerusalem. He broke with the Priestley school, rejecting a general resurrection and fixing the last judgment at death. In these and other points he closely followed the system of Newcome Cappe, but his careful avoidance of dogmatism left his pupils free, and none of them followed him into \u2018Cappism.\u2019 Among his coadjutors were Theophilus Browne, William Turnersee William Turner (1714\u20131794) and William Hincks.[see under , Robert Dix Hincks] From 1810 he had the invaluable co-operation of John Kenrick, who married his elder daughter L\u00e6titia."]}, {"page": "John Gooch Robberds", "response": ["In 1809 Robberds acted as assistant tutor in classics. He began to preach at Filby, Norfolk, during the summer vacation of 1809. Leaving York at midsummer 1810, he preached for a few months at the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, and was invited to settle there as colleague to Theophilus Browne; but on 19 December 1810 he was called to Cross Street Chapel, Manchester, in succession to Ralph Harrison, and as colleague to John Grundy."]}]}}
