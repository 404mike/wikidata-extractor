He received no formal art training, instead working as a cartoonist and illustrator on several Sydney university newspapers. His friend Bob Ellis got him a job at Nation Review in 1971, where he began his career as an editorial cartoonist.His controversial newspaper cartoons made him a household name, and a court hearing on his cartoon about architect Harry Seidler made front-page news in 1984. He received a number of Walkley Awards for his print cartooning.He co-wrote and featured in the satirical ABC television series The Gillies Report, which was broadcast in 1984 and 1985, and The Dingo Principle which was broadcast in 1987.He is married to the writer and comedian Jean Kittson and they have two daughters.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Bulletin (Australian periodical)", "response": ["* Patrick Cook"]}, {"page": "The Gillies Report", "response": ["The series starred Max Gillies, with a supporting cast that included John Clarke, Wendy Harmer, Phillip Scott, Tracy Harvey, Patrick Cook, Marcus Eyre, Geoff Kelso and Peter Moon. The primary writers were Cook, Clarke, Scott and Don Watson, with extra material by Harmer and Harvey. The on-screen troupe combined a wide range of skills, honed in many areas of arts and entertainment:", "* Patrick Cook was already well known in Australia for his incisive satirical cartoons, and in particular for his notorious legal clash with Modernist architect Harry Seidler. In 1982 Cook published a mordant satirical cartoon that lampooned Seidler's work, depicting the \"Harry Seidler Retirement Home\" in which pensioners were confined in blank, tower-like enclosures, pierced by slots, through which the occupants were fed and their waste removed with shovels. Enraged by this perceived insult to his work, Seidler promptly sued Cook for defamation, but famously lost both the initial case and the subsequent appeal, and (to Seidler's great chagrin) the publicity surrounding the case saw the cartoon reproduced widely.", "The Gillies Report also established or greatly furthered the screen careers of many of the cast, including Gillies, Harmer, Kelso, Clarke, and Harvey. John Clarke - whose regular reports on the fictional Australian sport of \"Farnarkling\" were another popular segment - carried on the Gillies Report tradition with the successful mockumentary series The Games (1998-2000), and continued with Clarke & Dawe, the long-running weekly satirical political commentary he wrote and performed with Bryan Dawe on ABC-TV until his untimely death at age 68 on 9 April 2017. Phillip Scott went on to co-write, musically direct and perform in the Sydney Theatre Company's annual Wharf Revue from 2000 through until 2017 (a live show of political satire, co-created by and co-starring Jonathan Biggins and Drew Forsythe). Scott, Patrick Cook and Wendy Harmer also worked on the ABC series The Big Gig, of which Ted Robinson was the producer (as he was on The Gillies Report), and Scott and Cook were later employed as writers on the ABC and Channel 10 series Good News Week.", "The Gillies Report sketch also parodied Packer's self-serving appearance to defend himself on his own network's current-affairs programme. It opens with Patrick Cook, in barrister's wig and gown, putting questions to 'Packer' (Gillies), about the allegations. He at first responds amiably, but gradually becomes enraged by the interrogation and the hostile reaction of the audience, and finally smashes up his desk, revealing that he has a long lizard-like tail. As the cast perform a satirical quasi-operatic song about the case, Packer - now transformed into \"The Goanna\" - is pursued through the TV station by the mob but, parodying King Kong, he escapes by scaling the transmitter tower of Packer's Sydney TV station TCN-9 where, now grown to gigantic size, he catches and crushes a news helicopter from a rival network. The desk-smashing also lampooned Packer's famously volcanic temper, and referenced a well-known rumour of the time, which claimed that Packer once smashed up his own office in a fit of rage during one of his many attempts to quit smoking."]}, {"page": "Newington College", "response": ["The title of Dux of the college is awarded to the best academic student each year in the senior form.
