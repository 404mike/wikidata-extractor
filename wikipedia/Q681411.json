He was a prolific goal scorer in his time there, notching 125 goals in 239 games. Despite often being overlooked by more glamorous, but less reliable, forwards such as Hughie Gallacher and Joe Bambrick, he remained loyal to the club.\nIn his debut season, Mills scored 14 goals in 20 games for Chelsea, helping them achieve promotion to the First Division. His best season was in 1936-37, when he scored 22 goals in 32 appearances, which earned him an England call-up. He won three international caps for England and scored three goals, all of which came in a 5\u20131 win against Northern Ireland on 23 October 1937.Mills was the first Chelsea player to score over 100 league goals, a feat only five others have since matched, and is the club's 8th highest goal scorer of all time. He is also the last Chelsea player to have scored a hat-trick against Liverpool, which came in a 6\u20131 win in August 1937. Upon retiring he became a coach at Chelsea.He later worked in the City of London for a printing company. He died while on holiday in Torquay in 1970.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chelsea F.C.", "response": ["Lampard is Chelsea's all-time top goalscorer, having scored 211 goals in 648 games (2001\u20132014); he passed Bobby Tambling's longstanding record of 202 in May 2013. Eight other players have also scored over 100 goals for Chelsea: George Hilsdon (1906\u20131912), George Mills (1929\u20131939), Roy Bentley (1948\u20131956), Jimmy Greaves (1957\u20131961), Peter Osgood (1964\u20131974 and 1978\u20131979), Kerry Dixon (1983\u20131992), Didier Drogba (2004\u20132012 and 2014\u20132015), and Eden Hazard (2012\u20132019). Greaves holds the club record for the most goals scored in one season (43 in 1960\u201361). While a Chelsea player, Greaves also became the youngest ever player to score 100 goals in the English top-flight, at 20 years and 290 days.", "In 1930, Chelsea featured in one of the earliest football films, The Great Game. One-time Chelsea centre forward, Jack Cock, who by then was playing for Millwall, was the star of the film and several scenes were shot at Stamford Bridge, including on the pitch, the boardroom, and the dressing rooms. It included guest appearances by then-Chelsea players Andrew Wilson, George Mills, and Sam Millington. Owing to the notoriety of the Chelsea Headhunters, a football firm associated with the club, Chelsea have also featured in films about football hooliganism, including 2004's The Football Factory. Chelsea also appear in the Hindi film Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. In April 2011, Montenegrin comedy series Nijesmo mi od ju\u010de made an episode in which Chelsea play against FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107 for qualification of the UEFA Champions League."]}, {"page": "Mills (surname)", "response": ["*George Mills (footballer) (1908\u20131970), English footballer", "*George Mills (RAF officer) (1902\u20131971), British Air Chief Marshal", "*Roger George Mills (born 1948), English race walker"]}, {"page": "British Home Championship", "response": ["|  George Mills"]}, {"page": "George Mills", "response": ["George Mills may refer to:", "*George Mills (footballer) (1908\u20131970), English footballer", "*George Mills (RAF officer) (1902\u20131971), British Air Chief Marshal", "*George Mills (novel), a 1982 novel by American author Stanley Elkin", "*George Mills (cricketer, born 1793) (1793\u20131865), English cricketer", "*George Mills (cricketer, born 1867) (1867\u20131942), New Zealand cricketer", "*George Mills (cricketer, born 1916) (1916\u20131979), New Zealand cricketer", "*George Mills (cricketer, born 1923) (1923\u20131983), English cricketer", "*George Mills (politician) (1876\u20131948), Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, 1920\u20131926", "*George Mills (writer) (1896\u20131972), children's author and schoolmaster", "*George Mills (artist) (1792\u20131824), British sculptor, engraver and medallist", "*George Mills (shipbuilder) (1808\u20131881), Scottish shipbuilder, journalist and novelist", "*George Mills (athlete) (born 1999), British champion athlete"]}, {"page": "List of Chelsea F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|8||style=\"text-align:left;\"| George Mills||1929\u20131943||116 (220)||7 (19)||0 (0)||0 (0)||0 (0)||123 (239)"]}, {"page": "History of Chelsea F.C.", "response": ["Calderhead stepped down in 1933 and was replaced by Leslie Knighton, but the appointment saw little change in Chelsea's fortunes. At different times during the decade the club had on its books such players as Tommy Law, Sam Weaver, Sid Bishop, Harry Burgess, Dick Spence and Joe Bambrick, all established internationals, yet their highest league finish in the decade was eighth. Ironically, two of the club's most reliable players during the decade cost them nothing: goalkeeper Vic Woodley, who was to win 19 consecutive caps for England, and centre-forward George Mills, the first player to score 100 league goals for Chelsea. They avoided relegation by two points in 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334, and by one point in 1938\u201339.

The visitors had much the better of the first half. Alex Jackson gave them the lead, and, in blizzard conditions, George Mills appeared to have scored in a goalmouth scramble, only for the goal to be disallowed after the Birmingham players drew the referee's attention to his linesman who had flagged for the ball having gone out of play. Six minutes into the second half, the lead had changed hands. First George Briggs crossed for a Bradford header, then the same pair combined for Curtis to put Birmingham ahead. Birmingham's defence held out until a misplaced clearance by Bob Gregg allowed Jackie Crawford to equalise. The replay at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge attracted a crowd of 74,365, then a ground record, with 6,000 locked out; spectators broke through the barriers and sat round the edge of the pitch. Briggs, in front of an empty goal,  allowed a centre from Curtis to pass between his legs \u2013 \"an amazing miss\" \u2013 before Chelsea centre-half John Townrow sustained an injury which forced him to leave the field. Chelsea reorganised their personnel, but early in the second half, right-half Sid Bishop was hurt twice in quick succession, leaving him in a worse condition than Townrow and his team short of numbers \u2013 no substitutes were permitted \u2013 with players in unaccustomed positions.
