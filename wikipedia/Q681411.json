He was a prolific goal scorer in his time there, notching 125 goals in 239 games. Despite often being overlooked by more glamorous, but less reliable, forwards such as Hughie Gallacher and Joe Bambrick, he remained loyal to the club.\nIn his debut season, Mills scored 14 goals in 20 games for Chelsea, helping them achieve promotion to the First Division. His best season was in 1936-37, when he scored 22 goals in 32 appearances, which earned him an England call-up. He won three international caps for England and scored three goals, all of which came in a 5\u20131 win against Northern Ireland on 23 October 1937.Mills was the first Chelsea player to score over 100 league goals, a feat only five others have since matched, and is the club's 8th highest goal scorer of all time. He is also the last Chelsea player to have scored a hat-trick against Liverpool, which came in a 6\u20131 win in August 1937. Upon retiring he became a coach at Chelsea.He later worked in the City of London for a printing company. He died while on holiday in Torquay in 1970.", "link_mentions": {}}}
