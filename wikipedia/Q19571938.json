Later in the week young midfielder Kyle Prior joined Lowland Football League side BSC Glasgow on loan until the end of the season. An early Joe Cardle goal consigned the club to their first defeat of 2018 against Dunfermline Athletic, a result that also left them without a home league victory since September. Iain Russell became the club's second signing of the January window, as he came out of retirement to re-join the club after leaving in 2006. A day later Sons tasted defeat again, going down 0-2 against league leaders St Mirren at the YOUR Radio 103FM Stadium, meaning that they still hadn't scored in 2018. Post-match it was confirmed that attacker Ally Roy wouldn't be having his loan spell from Hearts extended. On 22 January striker Kevin Nisbet joined the club on loan from Partick Thistle. A day later Dumbarton extended their run in the Scottish Cup with a 3-2 victory against Peterhead at Balmoor Stadium thanks to a double from Calum Gallagher and Iain Russell's first goal for the club since returning. That set up a fifth round tie with Greenock Morton. Despite the cup success however, Dumbarton remained winless (and goal-less) in the league in 2018, as first-half goals from Alan Lithgow and Ryan Hardie consigned them to a 2-0 defeat to Livingston.
