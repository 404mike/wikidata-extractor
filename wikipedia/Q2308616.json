He delivered the Ford Lectures at Oxford University in 1929. He went on to write Anglo-Saxon England, a volume of the Oxford History of England, first published in 1943 and widely considered a classic history of the period.\nStenton was a professor of history at the University of Reading (1926\u20131946), and subsequently the university's vice-chancellor (1946\u20131950). During his period as vice-chancellor at Reading, he presided over the university's purchase of Whiteknights Park, creating the new campus that allowed for the expansion of the university in later decades. In November 2008, it was announced that a new hall of residence to be constructed on that campus would be named Stenton Hall, in his honour. The annual Stenton Lecture, given by an eminent historian, was inaugurated at Reading University in 1967.He was knighted in the 1948 New Year Honours, and received the accolade from King George VI at Buckingham Palace on 10 February 1948.His wife, Doris Mary Stenton, wrote a preface to the third edition of Anglo-Saxon England, published after his death, and edited Preparatory to Anglo-Saxon England: Being the Collected Papers of Frank Merry Stenton, published in 1970. She was an historian in her own right, producing English Society in the Early Middle Ages for the Pelican History of England, and The English Woman in History (1957).Stenton's papers, together with those of his wife Doris, Lady Stenton, their library and his coin collection are part of the special collections at Reading University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bede", "response": ["Bede's account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the English Channel from Britain to Brittany described by Procopius, who was writing in the sixth century.

This was particularly attractive as it would lay the foundations for the establishment of an English monarchy. The 20th-century historian Frank Stenton said of the Anglo-Saxon chronicler that \"his inaccuracy is more than compensated by his preservation of the English title applied to these outstanding kings\".. He argued that the term bretwalda \"falls into line with the other evidence which points to the Germanic origin of the earliest English institutions\"."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelred the Unready", "response": ["Sir Frank Stenton remarked that \"much that has brought condemnation of historians on King \u00c6thelred may well be due in the last resort to the circumstances under which he became king.\" \u00c6thelred's father, King Edgar, had died suddenly in July 975, leaving two young sons behind. The elder, Edward (later Edward the Martyr), was probably illegitimate, and was \"still a youth on the verge of manhood\" in 975. The younger son was \u00c6thelred, whose mother, \u00c6lfthryth, Edgar had married in 964. \u00c6lfthryth was the daughter of Ordgar, ealdorman of Devon, and widow of \u00c6thelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia. At the time of his father's death, \u00c6thelred could have been no more than 10 years old. As the elder of Edgar's sons, Edward \u2013 reportedly a young man given to frequent violent outbursts \u2013 probably would have naturally succeeded to the throne of England despite his young age, had he not \"offended many important persons by his intolerable violence of speech and behaviour.\" In any case, a number of English nobles took to opposing Edward's succession and to defending \u00c6thelred's claim to the throne; \u00c6thelred was, after all, the son of Edgar's last, living wife, and no rumour of illegitimacy is known to have plagued \u00c6thelred's birth, as it might have his elder brother's."]}, {"page": "Edmund I", "response": ["Brunanburh saved England from destruction as a united kingdom, and it helped to ensure that Edmund would succeed smoothly to the throne, but it did not preserve him from challenges to his rule once he became king. The chronology of the Viking challenge is disputed, but according to the most widely accepted version, \u00c6thelstan's death encouraged the York Vikings to accept the kingshop of Anlaf Guthfrithson, the King of Dublin who had led the Viking forces defeated at Brunanburh. According to ASC D: \"Here the Northumbrians belied their pledges and chose Anlaf from Ireland as their king.\" Anlaf was in York by the end of 939 and the following year he invaded north-east Mercia, aiming to recover the southern territories of the York kingdom which had been conquered by Edward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. He marched on Northampton, where he was repulsed, and then stormed the ancient Mercian royal centre of Tamworth, with considerable loss of life on both sides. On his way back north he was caught at Leicester by an army under Edmund, but battle was averted by the mediation of Archbishop Wulfstan of York, on behalf of the Vikings, and probably the Archbishop of Canterbury acting for the English. They arranged a treaty at Leicester which surrendered the Five Boroughs of Lincoln, Leicester, Nottingham, Stamford and Derby, to Guthfrithson. This was the first serious setback for the English since Edward the Elder began to roll back Viking conquests in the early tenth century, and it was described by the historian Frank Stenton as \"an ignominious surrender\". Guthfrithson had coins struck at York with the lower Viking weight than the English standard,"]}, {"page": "London", "response": ["By the 11th century, London was clearly the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war.

R. L. Poole (Studies in Chronology and History, 1934) put forward the theory that Bede's years began in September, and if this theory is followed (as it was, for instance, by Frank Stenton in his notable history Anglo-Saxon England, first published in 1943), then the date of the Battle of Heavenfield (and the beginning of Oswald's reign) is pushed back from 634 to 633. Thus, if Oswald subsequently reigned for eight years, he would have actually been killed in 641. Poole's theory has been contested, however, and arguments have been made that Bede began his year on 25 December or 1 January, in which case Bede's years would be accurate as he gives them.) was King of Northumbria from 634 until his death, and is venerated as a saint,See entry for 5 August. of whom there was a particular cult in the Middle Ages.Craig, \"Oswald\""]}, {"page": "Offa's Dyke", "response": ["Sir Frank Stenton, the UK's most eminent 20th-century scholar on Anglo-Saxon England, accepted Fox's conclusions. He wrote the introduction to Fox's account of the Dyke.

The noble rank is designated in early centuries as gesi\u00feas ('companions') or \u00feegnas ('thegns'), the latter coming to predominate.  After the Norman Conquest the title 'thegn' was equated to the Norman 'baron'.Leges Henrici Primi  A certain amount of social mobility is implied by regulations detailing the conditions under which a ceorl could become a thegn. Again these would have been subject to local variation, but one text refers to the possession of five hides of land (around 600 acres), a bell and a castle-gate, a seat and a special office in the king's hall. In the context of the control of boroughs, Frank Stenton notes that according to an 11th-century source, \"a merchant who had carried out three voyages at his own charge [had also been] regarded as of thegnly status.\" Loss of status could also occur, as with penal slavery, which could be imposed not only on the perpetrator of a crime but on his wife and family."]}, {"page": "Harold Harefoot", "response": ["Harold himself is somewhat obscure; the historian Frank Stenton considered it probable that his mother \u00c6lfgifu was \"the real ruler of England\" for part or all of his reign. Kelly DeVries points out that during the High Middle Ages, royal succession in Northern Europe was determined by military power. The eldest son of a king could have a superior right of inheritance but still lose the throne to a younger brother, or other junior claimant, possessing greater military support. Harold managed to win the throne against the superior claim of Harthacnut in this way. The 11th century provides other similar examples. Magnus I of Norway (reigned 1035\u20131047), who wasn't a warlord, had reigned for more than a decade when his uncle Harald Hardrada (reigned 1047\u20131066) challenged his rule. With Harald being a famous military leader, his claim would end Magnus' reign early. Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders (reigned 1067\u20131070) was effectively succeeded by his brother Robert I (reigned 1071\u20131093), rather than his own sons. Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy (reigned 1087\u20131106) lost the throne of England to his younger brothers William II (reigned 1087\u20131100) and Henry I (reigned 1100\u20131135)."]}, {"page": "Edward the Martyr", "response": ["Modern historians have offered a variety of interpretations of Edward's killing.

The life of Oswald portrays Edward as an unstable young man who, according to Frank Stenton: \"had offended many important persons by his intolerable violence of speech and behaviour. Long after he had passed into veneration as a saint it was remembered that his outbursts of rage had alarmed all who knew him, and especially the members of his own household.\"Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 372  This may be a trope of hagiography.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, pp. 8\u20139."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d", "response": ["When \u00c6thelred died, Edward took control of the Mercian towns of London and Oxford and their hinterlands, which Alfred had put under Mercian control.

Alfred had constructed a network of fortified burhs in Wessex, and Edward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d now embarked on a programme of extending them to consolidate their defences and provide bases for attacks on the Vikings. According to Frank Stenton, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d led Mercian armies on expeditions, which she planned.  He commented: \"It was through reliance on her guardianship of Mercia that her brother was enabled to begin the forward movement against the southern Danes which is the outstanding feature of his reign\"."]}, {"page": "Ecgberht, King of Wessex", "response": ["Historians do not agree on Ecgberht's ancestry.

In Abels' view \u00c6thelwulf sought loyalty from the aristocracy and church during the king's forthcoming absence from Wessex, and displayed a sense of dynastic insecurity also evident in his father's generosity towards the Kentish church in 838, and in an \"avid attention\" in this period to compiling and revising royal genealogies. Keynes suggests that \"\u00c6thelwulf's purpose was presumably to earn divine assistance in his struggles against the Vikings\", and the mid-20th-century historian Eric John observes that \"a lifetime of medieval studies teaches one that an early medieval king was never so political as when he was on his knees\". The view that the decimation was a donation of the king's own personal estate is supported by the Anglo-Saxonist Alfred P. Smyth, who argues that these were the only lands the king was entitled to alienate by book. The historian Martin Ryan prefers the view that \u00c6thelwulf freed a tenth part of land owned by laymen from secular obligations, who could now endow churches under their own patronage. Ryan sees it as part of a campaign of religious devotion. According to the historian David Pratt, it \"is best interpreted as a strategic 'tax cut', designed to encourage cooperation in defensive measures through a partial remission of royal dues\". Nelson states that the decimation took place in two phases, in Wessex in 854 and Kent in 855, reflecting that they remained separate kingdoms."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelbald, King of Wessex", "response": ["Robert Howard Hodgkin also adopted Asser's views in his 1935 History of the Anglo-Saxons, but later historians have been more circumspect.

Anglo-Saxon kings did not have a fixed capital city. Their courts were peripatetic, and their councils were held at varying locations around their realms. \u00c6thelstan stayed mainly in Wessex, however, and controlled outlying areas by summoning leading figures to his councils. The small and intimate meetings that had been adequate until the enlargement of the kingdom under Edward the Elder gave way to large bodies attended by bishops, ealdormen, thegns, magnates from distant areas, and independent rulers who had submitted to his authority.
