The next day, Junon was still some way ahead of her pursuers when two more British ships, the 38-gun  and the 18-gun , appeared and caused her to alter her course.Clowes (Vol.V) pp. 431 - 432 Seeing Latona steering to cut her off, Junon turned back towards Horatio, passing her on the opposite tack and exchanging fire. A short engagement followed in which both frigates were greatly damaged but Junon, less so in the sails and rigging, was able to leave Horatio behind. She was then attacked by Superiere until Latona caught up and opened fire. Junons main and mizzen mast fell and she struck.Clowes (Vol.V) p. 432"]}, {"page": "Hugh Pigot (19th century admiral)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Pigot (Royal Navy officer, born 1775)"]}, {"page": "Hugh Pigot (19th-century admiral)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Pigot (Royal Navy officer, born 1775)"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["|Rear Admiral Sir Hugh Pigot"]}, {"page": "1831 Coronation Honours", "response": ["*Captain Hugh Pigot"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Navy admirals (1707\u2013current)", "response": ["|Hugh Pigot", "|Sir Hugh Pigot", "|Hugh Pigot Williams"]}, {"page": "Thames-class frigate", "response": ["Circe was commissioned in November 1804 by Captain Jonas Rose to serve off the coast of Portugal.Phillips, Circe (32) (1804).

On 1 March 1805 Circe took the Spanish 4-gun privateer Fama off Oporto and then on 21 June she took the French 10-gun privateer Le Constance. At the end of 1805 Circe sailed for the Leeward Islands Station with command changing to Captain Hugh Pigot at the beginning of 1806. On 5 April 1807 Circe captured the French 18-gun privateer brig Austerlitz off Barbados after a chase of eighteen hours; Austerlitz was the most successful privateer sailing from Guadeloupe and had evaded many attempts to capture her in the past. On 2 March 1808 landing parties from Circe, the frigate HMS Cerberus, and the post ship HMS Camilla attacked and captured the French island of Marie-Galante to stop it being used by privateers. Sailing off Diamond Rock on 31 October, Circe chased and captured the storm damaged French corvette Palineur after an action of fifteen minutes where one man from Circe and seven Frenchmen were killed. She found continued success towards the end of the year, assisting in the destruction of the French 18-gun brig Cygne on 12 December after a failed cutting out expedition from the boats of Circe had resulted in fifty-six casualties."]}]}}
