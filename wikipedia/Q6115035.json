Simon Singh of The Daily Telegraph described the Flying Spaghetti Monster as \"a masterstroke, which underlined the absurdity of Intelligent Design\", and applauded Henderson for \"galvanis[ing] a defence of science and rationality\". Sarah Boxer of The New York Times said that Henderson \"has wit on his side\". In addition, the Flying Spaghetti Monster was mentioned in an article footnote of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review as an example of evolution \"enter[ing] the fray in popular culture\", which the author deemed necessary for evolution to prevail over intelligent design. The abstract of the paper, Evolutionary Controversy and a Side of Pasta: The Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Subversive Function of Religious Parody, describes the Flying Spaghetti Monster as \"a potent example of how monstrous humor can be used as a popular tool of carnivalesque subversion\". Its author praised Pastafarianism for its \"epistemological humility\". Moreover, Henderson's website contains numerous endorsements from the scientific community. As Jack Schofield of The Guardian noted, \"The joke, of course, is that it's arguably more rational than Intelligent Design.\""]}, {"page": "Royal Photographic Society", "response": ["The Society's journal was original called The Journal of the Photographic Society of London and for most of its existence has simply been called The Photographic Journal, it is now called RPS Journal.
