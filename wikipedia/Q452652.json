Wakeman took up work by recording the soundtrack to the official 1982 FIFA World Cup documentary film G'ol\u00e9!, which was released around the same time as Cost of Living which hampered potential album sales. He wrote the soundtrack for the film She with assistance from Justin Hayward and Maggie Bell, and his second Russell feature, Crimes of Passion, with Bell on vocals, Fernandez on drums, and past Strawbs bandmate Chas Cronk on bass. Wakeman based the music around the themes of Symphony No. 9 by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. During this time, Wakeman became chairman of the Camberley Town F.C. Wakeman also spent early 1983 writing the score to the ballet Killing Games, but problems during its development led to the project being shelved, along with a potential double album of its music.
