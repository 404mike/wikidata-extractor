However, he also wrote of contemporary issues, largely from a rural perspective. He championed the rural working classes and was outspoken against all forms of hierarchy. While many of his stories are set in rural Galloway, there are also stories set in Edinburgh, Scotland, England, France, Spain, and further abroad.
