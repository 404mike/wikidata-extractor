He was Director of the University of Cambridge Computing Service from 1970\u20131994, Chief Executive of United Kingdom Joint Academic Network (JANET) 1994\u20131997, and Executive Director of Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) 1997\u20132002. He is now much involved with the National Museum of Computing.\nHe was involved in the development of the programming language CPL, whose influence can be traced on to C, and C++. He was president of the British Computer Society from 1999 to 2000 and chairman of the Computer Conservation Society from 2007 to 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "EDSAC", "response": ["In 1961, an EDSAC 2 version of Autocode, an ALGOL-like high-level programming language for scientists and engineers, was developed by David Hartley."]}, {"page": "Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge", "response": ["In 1961, David Hartley developed Autocode, one of the first high-level programming languages, for EDSAC 2.

Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances, and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A version was developed for the successor Titan (the prototype Atlas 2 computer) as a temporary stop-gap while a more substantially advanced language known as CPL was being developed. CPL was never completed but did give rise to BCPL (developed by M. Richards), which in turn led to B and ultimately C.
