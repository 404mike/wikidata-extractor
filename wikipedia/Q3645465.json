He spent five years with Palace, playing more than 100 games, and then another five years with Barnsley, before he returned to Watford. After leaving Watford in 2005 he played for Stoke City, Millwall, Sheffield United, Doncaster Rovers, Bradford City, Rotherham United, Chesterfield and York City. Dyer also represented England at under-21 level, and despite scoring four goals in 11 games, he was never capped at full level, and instead played one friendly for Montserrat against Ashford Town in 2007.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1975", "response": ["** Bruce Dyer, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Barnsley F.C.", "response": ["|2002|| Bruce Dyer", "|2003|| Bruce Dyer"]}, {"page": "Vicarage Road", "response": ["The Vicarage Road Stand was built following the conclusion of the 1992\u201393 season.

Having appeared in a little role for the side and was considering returning to his parent club, he had his loan spell extended for another month following an injury of Brynjar Gunnarsson. He then set up a goal for Bruce Dyer by crossing from a corner to meet Dyer, who scored a header, in a 2\u20131 win over Ipswich Town on 22 February 2005.

In a league match against Southampton, Zohar stepped up to take a penalty kick in place of regular penalty kick taker, Bruce Dyer. His weakly hit shot cost Palace the win and so his reputation with the supporters was forever tainted.  His dismal performances for Palace caused him to be voted by the fans as one of the top ten worst signings. In April 2012 Talk Sport magazine rated Zohar as Crystal Palace's Worst Foreign player.Uuuuu After returning from England, he was signed by Maccabi Haifa, as a replacement for Ukrainian midfielder Serhiy Kandaurov, who was sold to Portugal's Benfica. Haifa manager, Daniel Brailovsky was disappointed with Zohar's performances during practices and decided to let him languish on the bench during the season. After a falling out with Brailovsky, Zohar joined Maccabi Tel Aviv for his third stint but suffered an injury that saw him off the pitch for about 10 months. In retrospect, he later credited this injury to be the hardest part of his footballing career."]}, {"page": "List of foreign Premier League players", "response": ["*Bruce Dyer \u2013 Crystal Palace \u2013 1994\u201395, 1997\u201398"]}]}}
