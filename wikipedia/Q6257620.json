Here he acquitted himself well in several actions, after which he moved to the Baltic and was active in several engagements against the Russians during the Anglo-Russian War. Promoted to commander as a result, he took the bomb vessel HMS Terror to North America and was present at the assault on Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore, actions which inspired the writing of the poem that became the words to \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Promoted to post-captain towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars he retired ashore, and died in 1862 with the rank of vice-admiral.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Sheridan", "response": ["John Sheridan may refer to:", "*John Sheridan (footballer) (born 1964), Irish footballer", "*John Sheridan (ice hockey) (born 1954), American ice hockey player ", "*John Sheridan (rugby league) (1933\u20132012), English rugby league footballer and coach", "*John Sheridan (jazz) (born 1946), American jazz pianist", "*John Sheridan (New Jersey government official) (1942\u20132014), New Jersey government official", "*John Sheridan (New Brunswick politician) (1856\u20131932), Canadian politician in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick", "*John Sheridan (Royal Navy officer) (c. 1778\u20131862), vice-admiral of the Royal Navy", "*John Sheridan (editor) (1805\u20131858), editor of the London Morning Advertiser, migrated to South Australia 1849", "*John Sheridan (Babylon 5), a character in the US TV science fiction series Babylon 5"]}, {"page": "Battle of Baltimore", "response": ["* : Capt.
