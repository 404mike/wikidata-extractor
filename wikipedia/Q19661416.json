His collection of 30,000 species was catalogued by George Bentham, and donated to the Herbarium of Cambridge University. Banksia lemanniana was named in honour of him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Banksia lemanniana", "response": ["Described by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856, Banksia lemanniana was named in honour of English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It is one of three or four related species all with pendent inflorescences, which is an unusual feature of banksias. No subspecies are recognised. Banksia lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, and is one of the easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.", "The name Banksia lemanniana first appeared in print in 1852, being included in \"A List of the Proteaceae Collected in South-Western Australia by Mr James Drummond\", written by Carl Meissner and published in Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany. Four years later, Meissner published a formal species description in his chapter on the Proteaceae for A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. Neither of Meissner's publications gives an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is now accepted as honouring the English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann.  It has sometimes been misspelt \"lehmanniana\" after being mistakenly attributed to the German botanist Johann Lehmann. Common names include yellow lantern banksia and Lemann's banksia."]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (A\u2013C)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Lemann\"|Charles Morgan Lemann"]}, {"page": "List of plant family names with etymologies", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Lemann\"|Charles Morgan Lemann (1806\u20131852) ||Lamiales"]}]}}
