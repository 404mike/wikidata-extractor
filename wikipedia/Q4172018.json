Jerome described the pool under Sandford lasher as \"a very good place to drown yourself in\". The watercourse behind the lock-keeper's house (dated 1914) flows from the \"big lasher\" weir which creates strong currents and eddies. In spite of the danger, this was a favourite swimming place up to the mid-20th century. In 1921 the river here claimed the lives of three Christ Church students, including Michael Llewelyn Davies, the adopted son of J. M. Barrie, who was the inspiration for Peter Pan. An obelisk that has stood here since at least 1821 records the deaths of six Christ Church students who drowned here in three separate incidents between 1843 and 1921. Even into the 1950s the river at Sandford-on-Thames was still regarded as a place to come and relax. On Sundays people came from Oxford to swim at The Lido below the lock and to picnic. The King's Arms had extensive tea-lawns on which to spend lazy Sunday afternoons."]}, {"page": "Michael Davies", "response": ["* Michael Llewelyn Davies (1900\u20131921), foster son of the author J.M.
