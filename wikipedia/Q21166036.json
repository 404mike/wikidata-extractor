His main work was on nucleic acids, morphine and aporphine alkaloids. His work at University College Nottingham on electrometric titration was important in leading to the discovery of the DNA double helix by James Watson and Francis Crick, and he was described as \"a great nucleic acid chemist.\" He established the Scottish Seaweed Research Association and the Lace Research Council.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Masson", "response": ["His grandsons include the chemist John Masson Gulland FRSE (1898\u20131947) and James I.

Key data from Wilkins, Stokes, and Wilson, and, separately, by Franklin and Gosling, were published in two separate additional articles in the same issue of Nature with the article by Watson and Crick.
