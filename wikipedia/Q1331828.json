She frequently pairs traditional representational vocabularies and genres (landscape, portraiture) with seemingly antithetical postmodern strategies, such as institutional critique, appropriation, mapping and pastiche. Her work examines such themes as art as a mirror, interactions between built environment and landscape, ruins and the Picturesque aesthetic, and cultural and economic relationships between museums, artists and publics. Curator Henriette Huldisch writes of her work, \"haunted as it is by the notion of art\u2019s ultimate futility, her paradoxical stake is in persistently testing art\u2019s possibility to do something in the world after all.\" Harvey has had solo exhibitions at the Whitney Museum at Philip Morris, Corcoran Museum of Art, Groeninge Museum and Barnes Foundation, and been featured in the Whitney, Prague and Kwangju Biennials, and shows at MoMA PS1, Turner Contemporary, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art and SMAK, among others. She has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (2016) and public commissions in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, among others; her 2016 Belgian project, Repeat, won the Wivina Demeester Prize for Commissioned Public Art. Her work has been the subject of several books, including Ellen Harvey: Museum of Failure (2015) and The Unloved: Ellen Harvey (2014). She lives with her husband and son in Brooklyn, New York.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fictional politicians", "response": ["* Attorney General Martha Wilson (Ellen Harvey) \u2013 D-?, House of Cards"]}, {"page": "The Harvard Advocate", "response": ["*Ellen Harvey, visual artist"]}, {"page": "Brad Downey", "response": ["With collaborators Quenell Jones and Tim Hansberry, Downey directed Public Discourse (2003), a 38-minute documentary about graffiti and street art,Jakli\u010d, T., \"\u010clovek, ki stoji za leseno Melanio\u2014Skulptura je del razstave ameri\u0161kega umetnika Brada Downeyja v ljubljanski galeriji V\u017eigalica\", Delo, July 9, 2020. which screened at numerous locations including the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, Copenhagen International Documentary Festival and Transmediale in Berlin.
