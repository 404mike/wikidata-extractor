He worked as a biochemist at Cambridge University from 1967 to 1973 and as principal plant physiologist at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in India until 1978.Sheldrake's morphic resonance posits that \"memory is inherent in nature\" and that \"natural systems... inherit a collective memory from all previous things of their kind.\" Sheldrake proposes that it is also responsible for \"telepathy-type interconnections between organisms.\" His advocacy of the idea offers idiosyncratic explanations of standard subjects in biology such as development, inheritance, and memory.\nMorphic resonance is not accepted by the scientific community and Sheldrake's proposals relating to it have been widely criticised. Critics cite a lack of evidence for morphic resonance and inconsistencies between its tenets and data from genetics, embryology, neuroscience, and biochemistry. They also express concern that popular attention paid to Sheldrake's books and public appearances undermines the public's understanding of science.Other work by Sheldrake encompasses paranormal subjects such as precognition, empirical research into telepathy and the psychic staring effect.\nHe has been described as a New Age author.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sokal affair", "response": ["\"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\" proposed that quantum gravity has progressive political implications, and that the \"morphogenetic field\" could be a valid theory of quantum gravity.

In the early 1960s, he made the acquaintance of physicist David Bohm, whose philosophical and scientific concerns regarding the essence of the physical world, and the psychological and sociological state of mankind, found parallels in Krishnamurti's philosophy. The two men soon became close friends and started a common inquiry, in the form of personal dialogues\u2013and occasionally in group discussions with other participants\u2013that continued, periodically, over nearly two decades. Several of these discussions were published in the form of books or as parts of books, and introduced a wider audience (among scientists) to Krishnamurti's ideas.See Selected Publications/List of Books subsection. Although Krishnamurti's philosophy delved into fields as diverse as religious studies, education, psychology, physics, and consciousness studies, he was not then, nor since, well known in academic circles. Nevertheless, Krishnamurti met and held discussions with physicists Fritjof Capra and E. C. George Sudarshan, biologist Rupert Sheldrake, psychiatrist David Shainberg, as well as psychotherapists representing various theoretical orientations.See On Krishnamurti, by Raymond Martin, Wadsworth, 2003, for a discussion on Krishnamurti and the academic world.
