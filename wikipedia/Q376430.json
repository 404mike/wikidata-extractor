To replace Gopperth, former Falcon Rory Clegg was signed by Dean Richards for the second time, with Richards having previously signed Clegg for Harlequins when Clegg was just 19.  Four years later, the return of Clegg, alongside the returning Kieran Brookes from Leicester Tigers, provided evidence that talent was coming back to the Falcons.  The signings of former Scotland and Lions scrum-half Mike Blair from CA Brive, Saracens flanker Andy Saull, Scotland hooker Scott Lawson from London Irish, former Scotland fly half Phil Godman and one time France prop Franck Montanella showed the desire of the club to compete upon return to the top flight. Samoa wing Sinoti Sinoti and Argentina centre Gonzalo Tiesi were later added to the squad.  Despite a difficult season, which saw a number of retirements through injury, including Carlo Del Fava, the Falcons secured their place in the Aviva Premiership for 2014\u201315.", "Ahead of the 2015\u201316 campaign, England international prop Kieran Brookes and England under-20 lock Dominic Barrow departed for Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers respectively.

According to owner Bob Carruthers the SRU owed Edinburgh a six-figure sum which, he said, had not been paid. Carruthers also claimed that SRU had threatened to withdraw funding should Edinburgh continue with legal action relating to the sum. During the dispute, Alex Carruthers resigned along with then Managing Director Graeme Stirling. The dispute caused much disruption in Scottish rugby at the time, leading to the temporary withdrawal of 12 players from the Scotland squad training for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. This included leading players such as Chris Paterson and Mike Blair", "The 2011\u201312 season saw the introduction of several young players into the squad including d\u00e9but seasons for 21-year-olds Matt Scott and Grant Gilchrist, 19-year-old Harry Leonard and first full seasons for back three players Tom Brown and Lee Jones plus the back row pair Stuart McInally and David Denton. Most of these players would become regular starters for the club and Jones, Brown, Scott, Gilchrist, McInally and Denton were destined for international honours. Domestically the season was not a success, with only 6 league wins out of 22 games, but the 2011\u201312 Heineken Cup campaign proved to be the most successful in the club's history when it topped Pool 2, including a remarkable home victory against Racing M\u00e9tro by 48\u201347 and setting up a quarter final against French rugby giants Toulouse by scoring four tries against London Irish. The game against Toulouse in April 2012, was played before a new club record crowd of 38,887 and was closely contested, with Edinburgh holding out for a 19\u201314 win thanks to an early try from Mike Blair and penalties from captain Greig Laidlaw, setting up a semi-final in Dublin against Ulster. The semi-final was a close match but Ulster triumphed 22\u201319.", "The 2012\u201313 season started with much expectation after the strengthening of the squad through the additions of W. P. Nel, John Yapp, Richie Rees, Dimitri Basilaia, Ben Atiga, Greig Tonks, Izak van der Westhuizen, and Andy Titterrell. These arrivals were however tempered by the loss of several experienced internationals, Mike Blair, Chris Paterson, Jim Thompson, Alan MacDonald, Esteban Lozada and Phil Godman among them. However, after another poor start to the Pro12 League, Edinburgh were then beaten 0\u201345 by Saracens at Murrayfield in the first round of Heineken Cup matches. This was followed by another high-scoring defeat when the team lost 33\u20130 to Munster Rugby at Thomond Park.", "In addition, wing Duhan van der Merwe, prop Rory Sutherland, and flanker Hamish Watson have all toured with the British and Irish Lions in South Africa, with each one becoming a Test Lion in the first test match of the series, a 17-22 win for the Lions against the Springboks. However, in July 2021, Cockerill left Edinburgh by mutual consent.
