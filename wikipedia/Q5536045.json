The medicinal qualities of the spring water had been known to locals since at least the mid-18th century (indeed, cattle and sheep which drank from a particular drinking trough were said always to arrive at market in much better condition), and in the 1820s Abercromby had the qualities of the water scientifically analysed by the Professor of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow. He confirmed their exceptionally high mineral content and medicinal qualities.  On the back of this, Abercromby (by now in his eighties) decided to make the waters available for the public good, and invested in a properly engineered well-head to secure the source. When the scientific report was published, \"the Airthrey waters\" became famous and people soon came in large numbers to take them. Herein lay the origins of adjoining Bridge of Allan as a spa town: it was transformed from a \"sequestered retreat of rural life\" to \"a favoured resort of elegance and fashion\", with the springs one of the highest quality in Great Britain. Report, Chemical and Medical of the Aithrey Mineral Springs, Forest, 1831 \u2018A silent, modest, sensible man\u2019, Abercromby died at Airthrey in 1827 aged 87, by when he was the oldest general in the British army.  He was succeeded by his nephewGeorge Abercromby, 2nd Baron Abercromby (1770\u20131843), a lawyer, member of parliament and Lord Lieutenant of Stirlingshire, who was succeeded by George Abercromby, 3rd Baron Abercromby (1800\u20131852), a soldier, member of parliament and Lord Lieutenant of Clackmannanshire, who was in turn succeeded by his son George Abercromby, 4th Baron Abercromby (1838\u20131917).", "The Abercrombies owned Airthrey for just over 100 years.  In 1889 George Abercromby, 4th Baron Abercromby sold the Airthrey estate (3,100 acres in all) to Donald Graham, a prosperous Glasgow merchant, for \u00a375,000.|Logie, A Parish History  Donald Graham was a partner in William Graham & Co, a business built on the India trade, and spent many years in Bombay.  One limb of the business was the famous port shipper W & J Graham.  Donald Graham was a Justice of the Peace for the Counties of Lanarks and Stirling, and Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Stirling and County of Glasgow. He also served a term as Lord Dean of Guild for Glasgow, was a director of the Union Bank of Scotland, and was a member of the Stirling County Council. He is also thought to have been an early investor in and director of the oil business which became Shell, and one long-standing theory is that the famous Shell logo is ultimately derived from the scallop shell in the clan Graham coat of arms. He was also a distant kinsman of the Grahams who had lived at Airthrey until 1678. Donald Graham constructed a large addition to the castle in 1889\u201391, remodelling the north facade in a late Scots Baronial style.  The original Robert Adam design survives largely intact on the south side of the building, facing the gardens and loch. The Graham coat of arms can still be found in the stained glass window in the main entrance. During this period Aithrey Loch was popular with curlers and ice skaters, until an accident in 1901 which killed Frederick Pullar, a young surveyor noted for his part in a bathymetric survey of Scottish lochs, together with the lady he was attempting to rescue. After this tragic event Airthrey Castle Curling Club (founded 1878) only used the loch once more, in the cold winter of 1979.  Donald Graham died in 1901 after his carriage overturned on the drive at Airthrey and he caught pneumonia (his ornate monument is at neighbouring Logie Old Kirk). The estate passed to his widow Clara Graham, who in 1924 leased Airthrey Castle to the Glasgow shipping magnate Charles Donaldson, Chairman of the Donaldson Line group of shipping companies, who died at Airthrey in 1938."]}, {"page": "George Abercromby", "response": ["*George Abercromby, 4th Baron Abercromby (1838\u20131917), Scottish peer and politician"]}, {"page": "Abercromby (name)", "response": ["* George Abercromby, 4th Baron Abercromby (1838\u20131917), Scottish politician"]}]}}
