In addition to releasing two albums, What Are You Singing About (2006) and Calm the Rising Waters (2010), she performed at Glastonbury Festival 2009 and appeared on BBC Radio 2's Wake Up to Wogan.A native of the Dorset seaside resort town of Bournemouth, Lou Brown describes herself as a folk artist and, in his March 2009 Folk World review of What Are You Singing About, Adolf Goriup wrote that \"Lou is a wonderful singer with a soft voice and a great feeling for rhythm, which she proves with the outstanding opening song 'Morning Light'\", concluding the write-up with, \"Lou Brown has recorded an album that is really worth listening to... I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it.\" The album received airplay on regional UK radio stations such as Wave 105, Original 106 in Southampton and Bristol, Forest FM, BBC Radio Bristol, BBC Radio Gloucestershire, BBC Southern Counties Radio, BBC Somerset and BBC Radio Solent.
