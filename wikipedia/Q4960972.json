Gary \"Mani\" Mounfield, fresh from the well-publicised break-up of his previous band, The Stone Roses, was added as the band's new bassist, and Paul Mulraney was added as their new drummer. The arrival of Mani revitalized the group, who were considering disbanding after the failure of Give Out.

After taking time off for most of 1990, he returned to the road late in the year, touring as \"The Paul Weller Movement\" with long-term drummer and friend Steve White and Paul Francis (session bassist from The James Taylor Quartet). After a slow start playing small clubs with a mixture of Jam/Style Council classics as well as showcasing new material such as \"Into Tomorrow\", by the time of the release of his 1992 LP, Paul Weller, he had begun to re-establish himself as a leading British singer-songwriter. This self-titled album saw a return to a more jazz-guitar-focused sound, featuring samples and a funk influence with shades of the Style Council sound. The album also featured a new producer, Brendan Lynch. Tracks such as \"Here's a New Thing\" and \"That Spiritual Feeling\" were marketed among the emerging acid jazz scene."]}, {"page": "Vanishing Point (Primal Scream album)", "response": ["* Brendan Lynch \u2013 production (except 10)"]}, {"page": "Echo Dek", "response": ["* Brendan Lynch (For Lynchmob Productions) and Primal Scream \u2013 Original Production on Vanishing Point"]}, {"page": "XTRMNTR", "response": ["* Brendan Lynch", "* Brendan Lynch \u2013 production (1, 2, 3, 11), co-production (1, 3), recording (2, 3, 11)"]}, {"page": "Evil Heat", "response": ["* Brendan Lynch \u2013 synthesizer (7)"]}, {"page": "Glen Ballard", "response": ["* Brendan Lynch \u2014 Brendan Lynch (1997)"]}, {"page": "Moseley Shoals", "response": ["The album was produced by Brendan Lynch, and was recorded and mixed at the band's studio in Birmingham (Moseley Shoals).", "*Brendan Lynch \u2013 Production "]}, {"page": "The Riverboat Song", "response": ["Category:Song recordings produced by Brendan Lynch (music producer)"]}, {"page": "Stanley Road", "response": ["The album was co-produced by Brendan Lynch, who had also worked on Weller's previous two solo albums, Paul Weller and Wild Wood.", "*Brendan Lynch\u00a0\u2013 Cyremin (1,11), Mini-Moog (7), Tambourine (8), Accordion (8), Finger Cymbals (10)"]}, {"page": "Little Barrie", "response": ["As well as performing with Morrissey in 2004 and Primal Scream from 2006-present, Barrie Cadogan has also played live with Edwyn Collins, Johnny Marr, Paul Weller, Pete Molinari, Damo Suzuki and Yeti Lane, BP Fallon and Saint Etienne.

Carleen Anderson provides back-up vocals, as does Steve Cradock and Dr. Robert, who also play the guitar and bass guitar respectively. In addition, Steve White plays drums and Lynch played the Cyremin. Weller claimed that the song's title came from the name his daughter Leah gave to one of her dolls, although at the time his friend Terry Rawlings managed a band called that. The song expresses Weller's mantra of breaking things up if they are getting too comfortable; the previous year, he had divorced his wife, Dee C. Lee, breaking up what appeared to the public to be a happy marriage. In an interview with Mojo in 2010, he expressed that this was because there were senses \"that things were going too well, we were too happy, too comfortable, everything seemed too nice [and] that for me as a writer and an artist I might lose my edge. I had to break the shape up, re-arrange things\", noting that said turmoil supplanted the lyrics of the entire parent album and stated that the lyric 'numbed by the effect, aware of the muse, too in touch with myself, I light the fuse' \"was about the process of causing chaos around you\"."]}, {"page": "Minority Large", "response": ["*Brendan Lynch \u2013 mix engineer (track 1)"]}]}}
