Iuliu Maniu and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu against King Carol II of Romania\" pages 105-134 from The Slavonic and East European Review, Volume 85, Issue # 1, January 2007 page 124. Neither Britain, France or the United States had any wish to take in the Jewish refugees that Goga was creating by imposing increasingly oppressive anti-Semitic laws, and all three governments pressed for Carol to dismiss Goga as a way of nipping the developing humanitarian crisis caused by Goga in the bud. The British minister Sir Reginald Hoare and French minister Adrien Thierry both submitted notes of protest against the Goga government's anti-Semitism while President Roosevelt of the United States wrote a letter to Carol complaining about the anti-Semitic policies he was tolerating. On 12 January 1938, Goga stripped all Romanian Jews of their Romanian citizenship, a preparatory move towards Goga's ultimate goal of the expulsion of all Romanian Jews. Carol was personally not an anti-Semite, but in the words of his biographer Paul D. Quinlan the king was \"simply indifferent\" to the sufferings of his Jewish subjects caused by Goga's oppressive anti-Semitic laws.Quinlan, Paul The Playboy King, Westpoint: Greenwood Press, 1995 page 182. The opportunistic Carol did not believe in antisemitism anymore than he believed in anything else other than power, but if raison d'Etat meant tolerating an anti-Semitic government as the price of power, Carol was quite prepared to sacrifice the rights of his Jewish subjects. At the same time, Goga proved himself a better poet than politician, and there was a crisis atmosphere in early 1938 as the Goga government, which obsessed with solving the \"Jewish Question\" to the exclusion of everything else was clearly floundering. Weinberg wrote about Goga that he was \"Unprepared for office and untouched by any leadership ability...\" and whose clownish antics left diplomats stationed in Bucharest \"half-amused, half-appalled\". As Carol had expected, Goga proved to be such an inept leader as to discredit democracy while his anti-Semitic policies ensured that the none of the democratic great powers would object to Carol proclaiming a dictatorship."]}, {"page": "Ion Antonescu", "response": ["Antonescu traveled to Germany and met Hitler on eight more occasions between June 1941 and August 1944.Deletant, p. 280 Such close contacts helped cement an enduring relationship between the two dictators, and Hitler reportedly came to see Antonescu as the only trustworthy person in Romania,Deletant, p. 62 and the only foreigner to consult on military matters.Final Report, pp. 65, 168; Deletant, pp. 1, 280; Harvey, p. 498 The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that Hitler after first meeting Antonescu \"...was greatly impressed by him; no other leader Hitler met other than Mussolini ever received such consistently favourable comments from the German dictator. Hitler even mustered the patience to listen to Antonescu's lengthy disquisitions on the glorious history of Romania and the perfidy of the Hungarians\u2014a curious reversal for a man who was more accustomed to regaling visitors with tirades of his own.\"Weinberg, Gerhard A World At Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pp. 195\u2013196. In later statements, Hitler offered praise to Antonescu's \"breadth of vision\" and \"real personality.\"Harvey, p. 498 A remarkable aspect of the Hitler-Antonescu friendship was neither could speak others' language. Hitler only knew German while the only foreign language Antonescu knew was French, in which he was completely fluent.Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011 p. 214 During their meetings, Antonescu spoke in French which was then translated into German by Hitler's translator Paul Schmidt and vice versa since Schmidt did not speak Romanian either. The German military presence increased significantly in early 1941, when, using Romania as a base, Hitler invaded the rebellious Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Kingdom of Greece (see Balkans Campaign).Final Report, pp. 63\u201364; Deletant, pp. 61\u201363, 75\u201376, 304 In parallel, Romania's relationship with the United Kingdom, at the time the only major adversary of Nazi Germany, erupted into conflict: on 10 February 1941, British Premier Winston Churchill recalled His Majesty's Ambassador Reginald Hoare, and approved the blockade of Romanian ships in British-controlled ports.Deletant, pp. 26\u201327, 75 On 12 June 1941, during another summit with Hitler, Antonescu first learned of the \"special\" nature of Operation Barbarossa, namely, that the war against the Soviet Union was to be an ideological war to \"annihilate\" the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism,\" a \"war of extermination\" to be fought without any mercy; Hitler even showed Antonescu a copy of the \"Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia\" he had issued to his forces about the \"special treatment\" to be handed out to Soviet Jews. Antonescu completely accepted Hitler's ideas about Operation Barbarossa as a \"race war\" between the Aryans, represented by the Nordic Germans and Latin Romanians on the Axis side vs. the Slavs and Asians, commanded by the Jews on the Soviet side.Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011, pp. 325\u2013326 Besides anti-Semitism, there was an extremely strong current of anti-Slavic and anti-Asian racism to Antonescu's remarks about the \"Asiatic hordes\" of the Red Army.Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011, p. 325 The Asians Antonescu referred were the various Asian peoples of the Soviet Union, such as the Kazakhs, Kalmyks, Mongols, Uzbeks, Buryats, etc. During his summit with Hitler in June 1941, Antonescu told the F\u00fchrer that he believed it was necessary to \"once and for all\" eliminate Russia as a power because the Russians were the most powerful Slavic nation and that as a Latin people, the Romanians had an inborn hatred of all Slavs and Jews. Antonescu went on to tell Hitler: \"Because of its racial qualities, Romania can continue to play its role as an anti-Slavic buffer for the benefit of Germany.\" Ancel wrote that Romanian anti-Slavic racism differed from the German variety in that the Romanians had traditionally feared the Slavic peoples whereas the Germans had traditionally held the Slavic peoples in contempt.Ancel, Jean, The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011, p. 326 In Antonescu's mind, the Romanians as a Latin people had attained a level of civilization that the Slavs were nowhere close to, but theoretically the Slavic Russians and Ukrainians might be able to reach under Romanian auspices, through Antonescu's remarks to Hitler that \"We must fight this race (i.e. the Slavs) resolutely\" together, with the need for \"colonization\" of Transnistria, suggested that he did think this would happen in his own lifetime. Subsequently, the Romanians assigned to Barbarossa were to learn that as a Latin people, the Germans considered them to be their inferiors, albeit not as inferior as the Slavs, Asians and Jews who were viewed as untermenschen (\"sub-humans\"). Hitler's promise to Antonescu that after the war, the Germanic and Latin races would rule the world in a partnership turned out to be meaningless."]}, {"page": "Studland", "response": ["* Reginald Hoare, British diplomat"]}, {"page": "George Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd", "response": ["By October 1939, it was agreed that Lloyd would visit not just Romania, but all the Balkan states to work for a \"Balkan pact\".Atherton, Louise \"Lord Lloyd at the British Council and the Balkan Front, 1937\u20131940\" pages 25\u201348 from The International History Review, Vol. 16, No. 1, Feb., 1994 page 40.

The Foreign Office first learned of this plan from the Yugoslav Regent, Prince Paul, in November 1939. On 3 November 1939, Lord Halifax called a meeting to discuss the merits and demerits of the Balkan League plan, which Lloyd was allowed to attend by special permission of Halifax over the objections of Cadogan who argued that an outsider like Lord Lloyd should be attending a Foreign Office meeting.Atherton, Louise \"Lord Lloyd at the British Council and the Balkan Front, 1937\u20131940\" pages 25\u201348 from The International History Review, Vol. 16, No. 1, Feb., 1994 pages 41."]}, {"page": "List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Romania", "response": ["* 1935\u20131941: Sir Reginald Hoare"]}, {"page": "List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Iran", "response": ["*1931\u20131934: Sir Reginald Hoare"]}, {"page": "Minley Manor", "response": ["The current manor house was built in the French style by Henry Clutton between 1858 and 1860 for Raikes Currie, a partner in Glyn Mills' Bank and a member of the Currie family who benefited substantially from slavery in the British West Indies.

The remainder was landscaped as pleasure gardens by F W Meyer, working with the horticulturists Veitch & Sons of Exeter. On Raikes' death in 1881, his son Bertram Wodehouse Currie continued the development, employing Messrs Veitch to lay out a Winter Garden and extensions to the pleasure gardens, which included Hawley Lake, in the 1880s. The house was the birthplace of the British diplomat Sir Reginald Hoare in 1882.
