It stars Olivia Lee. In the show, Lee takes on an array of personas which include a woman with obsessive-compulsive disorder who is interviewing potential flatmates for her apartment; a nightclub promotions girl who cordons off public walkways, preventing pedestrians from accessing it and professes to them that the walkway leads to a nightclub; a temp on her first day in the office who always uses a loud pencil sharpener and keeps asking \"Is everything alright?\" and a mother who returns 'faulty electrical equipment' to a shop and complains that they don't work. The items in question are plays on words. For example, in the first episode, she takes a live white mouse to the shop as opposed to a computer mouse. Another of her characters is Miss Single, a delusional histrionic who attaches herself to men she has never met before, in each case claiming to be in a relationship with him."]}, {"page": "Al Murray's Compete for the Meat", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Dominic Littlewood, Olivia Lee, Peter Shilton"]}, {"page": "Balls of Steel Australia", "response": ["Series two sees some changes to the line up of comedians and their acts.
