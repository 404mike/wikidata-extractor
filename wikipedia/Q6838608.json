He grew up in the Heaton area of Bradford, West Yorkshire.\nHe officially joined the band in October 1998, just after the release of their first album, The Good Will Out.  Dale had been playing live and on record with the rest of the band beforehand, but was an 'unofficial member'. He composed all of the string arrangements for The Good Will Out.\nPrior to joining Embrace, he had previous experience with local bands Poppy Factory, Kitsch, Copingsaw, Lazer Boy and more famously Cud, who enjoyed moderate success themselves, including three Top 40 singles.\nAs well as his continuing work as a member of Embrace, Dale is currently working as a producer, making records with bands such as Glass Mountain, LELO, Marsicans, Talkboy and Faux Pas. He also owns and runs his own studio, known as 'The Cellar Of Dreams'.\nIn 2018, Dale produced an album with One Sided Horse entitled, \u201cBetween Light and Space\u201d which was released via UK Independent Butterfly Effect Label.\nOne Sided Horse began as a side project of Preston-based singer-songwriter, Mark Whiteside (Evil Blizzard). Dale also performed on the album alongside fellow Embrace members, Steve Firth, Mike Heaton and Richard McNamara.In early 2019, Dale and some close friends set up a label called 'the boy who left home to learn fear'. Run as a collective of filmmakers, visual artists and musicians, the label released two singles on 7 June 2019:\n\nLFR1 - LELO - \"About A Journey\" (digital and 7\" coloured vinyl\nLFR2 - Glass Mountain - \"Autumn Jam\" (digital only)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Good Will Out", "response": ["Musically, the sound of The Good Will Out has been described as Britpop and post-Britpop. It was compared to the works of Oasis and the Verve, which McNamara felt worked as \"good promotion\" for the release, but clarified that \"90% of 'The Good Will Out' was already written when these bands weren't even successful\". Wil Malone served as the conductor for a string section of the album, and Mickey Dale added keyboards to the recordings. While the album's booklet credits Dale with helping to arrange the strings, Richard McNamara said Craig Armstrong (who worked with Massive Attack at the time) had helped in that regard. The album's title is based on the proverb the truth will out, referring to being positive. It opens with the 40-second \"Intro\", which consists of a forty-piece orchestra setting up their instruments, ending with drum hits that segue into \"All You Good Good People\" featuring the orchestra. Danny McNamara thought the orchestra warming up \"sound[ed] incredible\", and ran into the studio's control room to have it recorded as the intro piece. He asked the orchestra to repeat what they had been doing; they could not remember and just improvised. On the second occasion the band worked with an orchestra, they had the tape rolling; the conductor can be heard filling out Musicians' Union forms. Dale described the piece as capturing the \"feel\" and \"all the excitement and ALL the nerves in the room\". He said \"All You Good Good People\" was the first time he had worked with the band; they required a string arrangement and had asked him for one. The track began originally as \"Mikes Fast\", and went through multiple versions before ending up in its final form. Varying tape noises can be heard, the result of the tape with McNamara's vocals being fast-forwarded and rewound.", "\"My Weakness Is None of Your Business\" was released as a single on 17\u00a0August 1998. The CD version included \"Feelings I Thought You Shared\" and \"Don't Turn Your Back on Me\", while the 12\" vinyl version featured those two songs and the Perfecto remix of \"One Big Family\". An edition dubbed The Abbey Road Sessions, recorded at Abbey Road Studios, was also released with versions of \"My Weakness Is None of Your Business\", \"Higher Sights\" and \"Retread\". The band embarked on a tour of the UK in September 1998, and then Japan and played three shows in the US. Before embarking on a European tour at the end of the year, touring keyboardist Mickey Dale was made an official member. The Good Will Out EP was released on 30\u00a0November 1998, consisting of the previously released live version of \"Butter Wouldn't Melt\" and \"Dry Kids\", as well as the \"road version\" of \"Blind\".
