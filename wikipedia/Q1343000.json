He is best known for playing Pope Sixtus IV in the television series Da Vinci's Demons (2013\u20132015), Randyll Tarly in the television series Game of Thrones (2016\u20132017), and Saint Paul in the film Paul, Apostle of Christ (2018).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pope Sixtus IV", "response": ["Pope Sixtus is portrayed by James Faulkner in the historical fantasy Da Vinci's Demons as having an identical twin, Alessandro. Shortly after the true Pope Sixtus, Francesco, was elected on conclave, Alessandro usurped the Holy See and had his brother locked up in Castel Sant'Angelo. The series implies that many of the more unsavoury parts of Sixtus' reign were really the work of his evil twin, who was out to gain power for himself."]}, {"page": "Herod Agrippa", "response": ["* Herod Agrippa is a major figure in Robert Graves' novel Claudius the God, as well as the BBC television adaptation I, Claudius, wherein he was portrayed by James Faulkner as an adult and Michael Clements as a child. He is depicted as one of Claudius's closest lifelong friends. Herod acts as Claudius's last and most trustworthy friend and advisor, giving him the key advice to trust no one, not even him. This advice proves prophetic at the end of Herod's life, where he is depicted as coming to believe that he is a prophesied Messiah and raising a rebellion against Rome, to Claudius's dismay. However, he is struck down by a possibly supernatural illness and sends a final letter to Claudius asking for forgiveness."]}, {"page": "2001 in film", "response": ["| Bridget Jones's Diary || Universal Pictures / StudioCanal / Miramax Films / Working Title Films || Sharon Maguire (director); Andrew Davies, Richard Curtis (screenplay); Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Jim Broadbent, Embeth Davidtz, Gemma Jones, Celia Imrie, James Faulkner, Shirley Henderson, James Callis, Sally Phillips, Lisa Barbuscia, Donald Douglas, Charmian May, Paul Brooke, Patrick Barlow, Felicity Montagu, Neil Pearson, Dolly Wells, Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes, Jeffrey Archer, Honor Blackman, Christopher Kouros || Romance, Comedy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1984 in film", "response": ["| Eureka || MGM/UA / Recorded Picture Company / JF Productions / Sunley Productions || Nicolas Roeg (director); Paul Mayersberg (screenplay); Gene Hackman, Rutger Hauer, Theresa Russell, Mickey Rourke, Joe Pesci, Jane Lapotaire, Ed Lauter, Joe Spinell, James Faulkner, Corin Redgrave, Helena Kallianiotes, Cavan Kendall, Norman Beaton, Emrys James, Emma Relph, Timothy Scott, Ian Tracey || Drama || Live action "]}, {"page": "1983 in film", "response": ["| Eureka || MGM/UA Entertainment Company / Recorded Picture Company / JF Productions / Sunley Productions || Nicolas Roeg (director); Paul Mayersberg (screenplay); Gene Hackman, Theresa Russell, Rutger Hauer, Jane Lapotaire, Mickey Rourke, Ed Lauter, Joe Pesci, Joe Spinell, James Faulkner, Corin Redgrave, Helena Kallianiotes || Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "1979 in film", "response": ["| Zulu Dawn || American Cinema Releasing || Douglas Hickox (director); Cy Endfield, Anthony Storey (screenplay); Burt Lancaster, Peter O'Toole, Simon Ward, Nigel Davenport, Michael Jayston, Peter Vaughan, Denholm Elliott, James Faulkner, John Mills, Christopher Cazenove, Bob Hoskins, Ronald Pickup, Ronald Lacey, Ken Gampu, Simon Sabela, Abe Temba, Gilbert Tiabane || Adventure, War || Live Action"]}, {"page": "Hitman (franchise)", "response": ["* Agent Carlton Smith (voiced by Noah Lazarus from Hitman: Codename 47 until Hitman: Contracts, David Andriole in Hitman: Blood Money, and Dave Hill in Hitman; played by James Faulkner in the 2007 film): A fairly inept American CIA agent with ties to the ICA. He has a tendency to be captured and tortured by the people he has been assigned to spy on. As a result, 47 found himself forced to rescue him on multiple occasions. Smith's torture experiences have caused him to take up drinking on the job, making him even more ineffective. Like 47, Smith dons a variety of disguises, but most often he's seen beaten and stripped down to his American Flag boxer shorts. He seems to regard 47 as a friend, but the feeling is not mutual. 47 initially treats his relationship with Smith as detached and professional, but as he is forced to rescue Smith again and again, he increasingly sees Smith as a hindrance. In Hitman: Blood Money, 47 threatens to kill Smith at one point, until he gives him a useful lead regarding an upcoming White House assassination. Smith's appearance changes somewhat in Hitman: Blood Money, having lost most of his hair through long term alcoholism and depression. However, he returns to his old look when he appears for a brief cameo in the 2016 Hitman game. In the 2007 film, Smith is portrayed as an elderly, very competent, and dutiful CIA agent, who in return for the assassination of a high priority CIA target (Udre Belicoff, the brother of 47's original target), helps 47 elude arrest by Interpol."]}, {"page": "Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London", "response": ["In the United Kingdom, Cody poses as a summer orchestra student at the Kenworth estate to spy on owner Lord Duncan Kenworth (James Faulkner), suspected of working with Diaz, supported by his handler, Derek (Anthony Anderson) and Kumar (Rod Silvers), Derek's right-hand man, who are disguised as a chef hired by Lady Josephine Kenworth (Anna Chancellor) and a taxi driver respectively.
