Similar to his own Beetlejuice, Burton \"wanted to make [the special effects] look cheap and purposely fake-looking as possible.\" He first approached Henry Selick, director of The Nightmare Before Christmas, to supervise the stop motion work, but Selick was busy directing James and the Giant Peach, also produced by Burton. Despite the fact that Warner Bros. was skeptical of the escalating budget and had not yet greenlit the film for production, Burton hired Barry Purves to shepherd the stop motion work. Purves created an international team of about 70 animators, who worked on Mars Attacks! for eight months and began compiling test footage in Burbank, California. The department workers studied Gloria Swanson's choreography and movement as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard for inspiration on the Martians' movement."]}, {"page": "List of animators", "response": ["* Barry Purves"]}, {"page": "49th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Achilles \u2013 Glenn Holberton and Barry Purves"]}, {"page": "Willow pattern", "response": ["The story of the willow pattern was turned into a comic opera in 1901 called The Willow Pattern.
