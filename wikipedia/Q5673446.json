He is best known for his role in setting up the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence under Henry Tizard, which led directly to the development and introduction of radar in the UK. He is also known for the development of the Drift Sight and Course Setting Bomb Sight during World War I, devices that revolutionised the art of bombing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of computing hardware", "response": ["Mechanical devices were also used to aid the accuracy of aerial bombing. Drift Sight was the first such aid, developed by Harry Wimperis in 1916 for the Royal Naval Air Service; it measured the wind speed from the air, and used that measurement to calculate the wind's effects on the trajectory of the bombs. The system was later improved with the Course Setting Bomb Sight, and reached a climax with World War II bomb sights, Mark XIV bomb sight (RAF Bomber Command) and the Norden (United States Army Air Forces)."]}, {"page": "Robert Watson-Watt", "response": ["Rumours that Nazi Germany had developed a \"death ray\" that was capable of destroying towns, cities and people using radio waves, were given attention in January 1935 by Harry Wimperis, Director of Scientific Research at the Air Ministry. He asked Watson-Watt about the possibility of building their version of a death-ray, specifically to be used against aircraft. Watson-Watt quickly returned a calculation carried out by his young colleague, Arnold Wilkins, showing that such a device was impossible to construct and fears of a Nazi version soon vanished. He also mentioned in the same report a suggestion that was originally made to him by Wilkins, who had recently heard of aircraft disturbing shortwave communications, that radio waves might be capable of detecting aircraft, \"Meanwhile, attention is being turned to the still difficult, but less unpromising, problem of radio detection and numerical considerations on the method of detection by reflected radio waves will be submitted when required\". Wilkins's idea, checked by Watt, was promptly presented by Tizard to the CSSAD on 28 January 1935."]}, {"page": "Chain Home", "response": ["The need to research better forms of air defense prompted Harry Wimperis to press for the formation of a study group to consider new concepts. Lord Londonderry, then Secretary of State for Air, approved the formation of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence in November 1934, asking Henry Tizard to chair the group, which thus became better known to history as the Tizard Committee."]}, {"page": "Henry Tizard", "response": ["After the end of the war, he was made Reader in Chemical Thermodynamics at Oxford University, where he experimented in the composition of fuel trying to find compounds which were resistant to freezing and less volatile, devising the concept of \"toluene numbers\", now referred to as octane ratings. After that work (largely for Shell), he took up again a government post in 1920 as Assistant Secretary to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. His successes in that post (and after promotion to permanent secretary on 1 June 1927) included the establishment of the post of the Chemical Research Laboratory in Teddington, the appointment of Harry Wimperis as Director of Scientific Research to the Air Force and finally the decision to leave to become the President and Rector of Imperial College London in 1929, a position he held until 1942, when he was elected President of Magdalen College, Oxford."]}, {"page": "Bombsight", "response": ["A great upgrade to the basic concept was introduced by Harry Wimperis, better known for his later role in the development of radar in England. In 1916 he introduced the Drift Sight, which added a simple system for directly measuring the wind speed. The bomb aimer would first dial in the altitude and airspeed of the aircraft. Doing so rotated a metal bar on the right side of the bombsight so it pointed out from the fuselage. Prior to the bomb run, the bomber would fly at right angles to the bomb line, and the bomb aimer would look past the rod to watch the motion of objects on the ground. He would then adjust the wind speed setting until the motion was directly along the rod. This action measured the wind speed, and moved the sights to the proper angle to account for it, eliminating the need for separate calculations. A later modification was added to calculate the difference between true and indicated airspeed, which grows with altitude.  This version was the Drift Sight Mk. 1A, introduced on the Handley Page O/400 heavy bomber.The Encyclopedia of Military Aircraft, 2006 Edition, Jackson, Robert  Parragon Publishing 2002 Variations on the design were common, like the US Estoppey bombsight."]}, {"page": "Mark XIV bomb sight", "response": ["In 1917 Harry Wimperis introduced the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced the tables and timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind. As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was pushed to the left or right, indicating the required angle to fly to take the aircraft over the target. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom."]}, {"page": "Albert Rowe (physicist)", "response": ["In the Air Ministry he read up everything he could find on the art of air defence, and became alarmed. Working at that time for Harry Wimperis, he wrote a memo to him that concluded that \"we were likely to lose the war if it starts within the next ten years\". Wimperis took the report seriously, and in 1934 started the formation of what later became known as the Tizard Committee, which supported the early development of radio-based detection."]}, {"page": "Drift Sight", "response": ["The Drift Sight was a bombsight developed by Harry Wimperis in 1916 for the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS).

It is also widely referred to as the Wimperis sight after its inventor, Harry Wimperis.", "In 1916, Harry Wimperis started the design of a new bombsight, working in collaboration with Scarff. This new Drift Sight included a simple system that greatly eased the measurement of the wind. By observing their movement over the ground, the aircraft would first determine the direction of the wind. The aircraft would then turn to fly at right angles to this wind direction so that the wind was pushing the aircraft sideways. Observing the sideways drift of the aircraft by comparing the motion of objects on the ground to a metal rod along the side of the bombsight, the drift could be seen. Using a knob, the rod was angled away from the side of the aircraft until objects could be seen moving directly along the line of the rod. A gear in the knob that adjusted the rod angle also drove the sights fore or aft, moving them to account for the wind speed. This eliminated the need for a stopwatch to measure the ground speed. However, the Drift Sight was still useful only for bomb runs along the wind line."]}, {"page": "John Madsen (physicist)", "response": ["In July 1937 Rutherford wrote to JPVM in part advising that: \"My friend Wimperis is, I believe, visiting New Zealand and Australia shortly in connection with the Air Ministry. I hope you will have an opportunity of meeting him. He is a thoroughly sound fellow and a good friend of mine. We have played many a game of golf together\". Harry Wimperis was closely involved with Henry Tizard in 1934 in initiating the British RDF (radar) effort as a means to defeat the expected bomber raids from Germany. Wimperis had been invited by the Australian Government to advise on setting up an Aeronautical industry in Australia as a defence measure & one result was that JPVM arranged for Sydney University to set up a chair in Aeronautical Engineering. In a private conversation with JPVM in Melbourne during this visit Wimperis tacitly acknowledged that Britain was working on a radio based method of detecting aircraft."]}, {"page": "Whitworth Society", "response": ["|Harry Wimperis"]}, {"page": "H.
