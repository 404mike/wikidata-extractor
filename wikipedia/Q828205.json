Coleraine thus gained its first experience of European football, against Soviet outfit Dynamo Kiev. Coleraine also won the first two Blaxnit all-Ireland cups in 1969 and 1970.

Bertie Peacock resigned in 1974 and Ivan Murray and Johnny McCurdy took over the reins. Murray continued as manager until 1978 and during his spell in charge the Irish Cup was won twice more \u2013 both times against Linfield.

(1887\u20131994)", "response": ["The 1950s saw several players emerge as mainstays in the Celtic side, Bobby Evans, Bertie Peacock, Bobby Collins and perhaps most memorably, Charlie Tully.  Tully was a charismatic performer who combined audacious dribbling with outright showboating and razor sharp wit.  In a Scottish Cup tie in 1953 at Falkirk, Tully scored direct from a corner.  The 'goal' was disallowed by the referee as the ball had been placed slightly outwith the arc.  Tully re-took the corner and swung the ball directly into the net again.  Tully became hugely popular with the Celtic support, and 'Tullymania' resulted in Glasgow cafes selling 'Tully ice cream', bars serving 'Tully cocktails' and drapers producing 'Tully ties'."]}, {"page": "2004 in association football", "response": ["* 23 July \u2013 Bertie Peacock (75), Northern Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "Saint Mungo Cup", "response": ["|IL ||||Bertie Peacock"]}, {"page": "Michael O'Neill (footballer)", "response": ["O'Neill was brought in to Coleraine by former Northern Ireland internationals Bertie Peacock and Jim Platt, making his debut in the Irish League at the age of 15 and was a regular in the side by the age of 18.
