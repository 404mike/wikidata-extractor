Hornby served on frigates throughout most of his wartime experience, which included witnessing the Nore Mutiny first hand aged 12 in 1797. Later, commanding his own sixth-rate HMS Volage in 1811, Hornby played a vital role in the British victory at the Battle of Lissa. At Lissa a British squadron under William Hoste overwhelmed a French force more than twice their own strength, Volage combating a much larger ship alone for several minutes and taking numerous casualties, including Hornby, who was wounded.\nLater in life, Hornby accepted a succession of home and seagoing positions to ensure the promotion prospects for his son in the navy as well as to support his close allies in Parliament under the Earl of Derby, to whom he was related. These positions included a period in command of the Pacific Fleet and later a role as one of the Lords of the Admiralty. During his career, Hornby accrued numerous awards and accolades, being made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath and a full admiral before his death in 1867.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Second Sea Lord and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff", "response": ["* Vice-Admiral Sir Phipps Hornby, 1852\u20131853"]}, {"page": "Pacific Station", "response": ["|Rear Admiral Phipps Hornby || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 25 August 1847 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 21 August 1850 ||"]}, {"page": "George Tryon", "response": ["Each year the fleet held a regatta where officers and men from different ships competed against each other, training for months in advance.
