According to WG Grace, few bowlers had a better record.\nShaw was born at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. He joined Nottinghamshire in 1865 and played every consecutive Notts game over a ten-year period. He also made numerous appearances in representative teams such as the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series, the North of England cricket team and the All-England Eleven.  He played against W G Grace many times and had some successes, including twice dismissing him for nought in 1871.  Grace said after the second of these that he \"would pay particular attention to J C Shaw\".  In the next innings, Grace scored a double-century.  Shaw's comment afterwards was famous for its ruefulness and it has often been quoted: \"I puts the ball where I likes and he puts it where he likes\".Shaw was a left-arm round arm  fast bowler and took 642 first-class wickets at an average of 14.41 and a best performance of 9 for 86. WG Grace noted that he had a high-delivery  that was sometimes difficult to play, and brought his arm from behind with a very quick action making it difficult to see. Shaw still has the best ever bowling figures for Nottinghamshire, taking 10 wickets for 20 runs in a match against an England XI in 1870  He was a right-hand batsman  and played 176 innings in 115 matches with an average of 4.24 and a top score of 18 not out.  Grace described him as a very poor bat \u2013 in fact Shaw did not reach double figures until his seventy-second first-class innings, setting a record since equalled only by Eric Hollies for consecutive single-figure innings. Indeed, for Nottinghamshire Shaw reached double figures only once in 109 visits to the crease.\nShaw died at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, at the age of 51.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. G.

In all first-class matches in 1871, a total of 17 centuries were scored and Grace accounted for 10 of them, including the first century in a first-class match at Trent Bridge.Rae, p.99. He averaged 78.25 and the next best average by a batsman playing more than a single innings was 39.57, barely more than half his figure. His aggregate for the season was 2,739 runs and this was the first time that anyone had scored 2,000 first-class runs in a season; Harry Jupp was next best with 1,068.

A fast or fast-medium bowler renowned for his accurate bowling and particular hostility on uncovered wickets, he played county cricket for Derbyshire from 1947 to 1963, and was regularly at, or near the top of, the English bowling averages. He played in only two Test matches for England, one in 1949 and a second in 1961. Jackson's absence from Test cricket was largely because his batting was so underdeveloped: his highest first-class score was 39 not out, and he reached 30 on only two other occasions. Between July 1949 and August 1950, Jackson indeed played fifty-one innings without reaching double figures,Webber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 317.

In 1992 he claimed 50 first-class victims at 22.68, taking five wickets in an innings three times, though he had a poor year in the limited-overs game. He also reached double figures with the bat for the first time in three and a half years when he made 12 against Hampshire in May. In between, he had played sixty one innings without reaching double figures, which is the fourth longest such sequence after Jem Shaw between 1865 and the last match of 1870 (71 innings), Eric Hollies between 1948 and 1950 (71 innings) and his Northamptonshire predecessor Nobby Clark between 1925 and 1927 with 65 consecutive single-figure innings.Webber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 317.
