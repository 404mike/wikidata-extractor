Modifications were made to it in the 1720s by Giacomo Leoni, who retained some of the Elizabethan features and added others, particularly the courtyard and the south range. It is difficult to classify Leoni's work at Lyme, as it contains elements of both Palladian and Baroque styles.  Further modifications were made by Lewis Wyatt in the 19th\u00a0century, especially to the interior. Formal gardens were created and developed in the late 19th and early 20th\u00a0centuries. The house, gardens and park have been used as locations for filming and they are open to the public.

This house, by an unknown designer, was L-shaped in plan with east and north ranges; piecemeal additions were made to it during the 17th\u00a0century. In the 1720s Giacomo Leoni, an architect from Venice, added a south range to the house creating a courtyard plan, and made other changes. While he retained some of its Elizabethan features, many of his changes were in a mixture of Palladian and Baroque styles. During the latter part of the 18th\u00a0century Piers Legh\u00a0XIII bought most of the furniture which is in the house today. However, the family fortunes declined and the house began to deteriorate. In the early 19th\u00a0century the estate was owned by Thomas Legh, who commissioned Lewis Wyatt to restore the house between 1816 and 1822. Wyatt's alterations were mainly to the interior, where he remodelled every room. Leoni had intended to add a cupola to the south range but this never materialised. Instead, Wyatt added a tower-like structure (a hamper) to provide bedrooms for the servants. He also added a one-storey block to the east range, containing a dining-room. Later in the century William Legh, 1st Baron Newton, added stables and other buildings to the estate, and created the Dutch Garden.  Further alterations were made to the gardens by Thomas Legh, 2nd Baron Newton and his wife during the early 20th\u00a0century.  During the Second World War, the park was used as an RAF lorry depot. In 1946 Richard Legh, 3rd Baron Newton, gave Lyme Park to the National Trust.

Egerton-Warburton came of age (21) in 1826 and decided to completely replace the house.

He chose George Latham as his architect.  Latham, who was practising in Nantwich, was at that time in his twenties and was relatively unknown. He submitted four schemes for a symmetrical Gothic house, but these were not accepted. Then Latham prepared new plans which he called \"Queen Elizabethan\".  He suggested that this could be built for about \u00a35,000\u20136,000.  Every feature in the house had to have an exact model in an existing Elizabethan building. Egerton-Warburton and Latham visited 16th-century houses and studied illustrations to ensure that the features were dated correctly to Queen Elizabeth's reign.
