He was later commissioned in the RNVR. Demobbed in 1946 in the rank of sub-lieutenant, Jackson joined the Foreign Office the following year. In 1956 Jackson was posted to Bonn to liaise between the Allied occupying forces and the embassy. From Bonn he was posted in 1960 to be consul at Guatemala City, a politically sensitive posting given Guatemala's longstanding claim to British Honduras (now Belize). In 1969 he then spent six months at the NATO Defence College in Rome before going to Berlin as political adviser and Head of Chancery at the British Military Government. Between 1970 and 1972 he played a crucial part in the talks between the occupying powers and the Russians. The negotiations led to West Berliners being able, for the first time in more than 25 years, to visit relatives in East Germany, and to West Berlin being able to be represented abroad by West Germany. From 1973-1975 Jackson served as head of the Defence Department at the Foreign Office. He served as British Ambassador to Cuba from 1975\u20131979. As there was no American presence in Cuba Jackson went several times to Washington to brief the State Department, and George H. W. Bush when he was head of the CIA. He went on to serve as British Ambassador to Belgium from 1982\u20131985. Jackson was appointed CMG in 1977 and knighted  in 1984. In retirement he served as a trustee of the Imperial War Museum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Naval Reserve", "response": ["* Sir John Edward Jackson, diplomat."]}, {"page": "John Jackson", "response": ["* John Edward Jackson (diplomat) (1925\u20132002), British diplomat", "* John Edward Jackson (antiquarian) (1805\u20131891), English cleric and archivist"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Cuba", "response": ["*1975\u20131979: Edward Jackson"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Belgium", "response": ["* 1982\u20131985: Sir Edward Jackson"]}, {"page": "Edward Jackson", "response": ["*Edward Jackson (American football), former American college football head coach", "*Edward Jackson (diplomat) (1925\u20132002), British diplomat", "*Edward Jackson (cricketer, born 1849) (1849\u20131926), English cricketer", "*Edward Jackson (cricketer, born 1955) (born 1955), English cricketer", "*Edward Jackson (Delhi cricketer) (born 1922), Indian cricketer", "*Edward Jackson (footballer) (1925\u20131996), Australian rules footballer in the VFL", "*Edward Jackson (manufacturer) (1799\u20131872), tinware manufacturer", "*Edward Jackson (photographer) (1885\u20131967), American photographer and photojournalist", "*Edward Jackson, a character in The $5,000,000 Counterfeiting Plot"]}, {"page": "Jackson (name)", "response": ["*Edward Jackson (footballer) (1925\u20131996)", "*Edward Jackson (photographer) (1885\u20131967), American photographer", "*David Edward Jackson (1788\u20131837), American explorer", "*Sir Edward Jackson (diplomat) (1925\u20132002), British diplomat", "*Edward Jackson (manufacturer) (1799\u20131872), Canadian businessman", "*Jack Edward Jackson or Jaxon (1941\u20132006), American cartoonist, illustrator, historian, and writer"]}, {"page": "John Edward Jackson", "response": ["John Edward Jackson may refer to:", "* Edward Jackson (diplomat) (John Edward Jackson, 1925\u20132002), British diplomat", "* John Edward Jackson (antiquarian) (1805\u20131891), English cleric, antiquary and archivist"]}, {"page": "1977 Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours", "response": ["*John Edward Jackson, HM Ambassador, Havana"]}, {"page": "1984 New Year Honours", "response": ["*John Edward Jackson, , HM Ambassador, Brussels."]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2002", "response": ["*Sir Edward Jackson, 76, English diplomat, (Ambassador to Cuba, Ambassador to Belgium)."]}, {"page": "List of Old Ardinians", "response": ["*Sir Edward Jackson  - UK Ambassador to Belgium and UK Ambassador to Cuba"]}]}}
