He also featured for Northampton Town, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool United, Birmingham City and Derby County, before signing for Burton Albion in 2006, aged 43.\nLatterly employed as goalkeeping coach in addition to being registered as a player, Poole made his final appearance for Burton in 2010. He had an interim spell as manager in 2012, when he retired from playing at the age of 48; however, he later re-registered himself as a player on two occasions due to goalkeeping crises at the club, making Poole one of the few players in English football ever to be registered to a professional club at the age of 50. He has gone on to hold similar roles at Kidderminster Harriers, Birmingham City and Derby County.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 21", "response": ["*1963 \u2013 Kevin Poole, English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["|1994\u201395|| Kevin Poole"]}, {"page": "Burton Albion F.C.", "response": ["* 2007   Kevin Poole"]}, {"page": "Ian Bennett (footballer)", "response": ["Barry Fry signed Bennett for Birmingham City for \u00a3325,000 in December 1993.

A broken finger in 1999\u20132000 pre-season extended his absence, but he returned to the team in October for a League Cup match at home to Newcastle United. With his first touch, he saved a penalty kick taken by Alan Shearer and Birmingham went on to win 2\u20130. He spoke after the match about his frustration with the injuries and his desire for first-team football, preferably with Birmingham. He kept his place for a few weeks before being dropped because of his contractual dispute with the club, but signed a new deal in January 2000 and returned to the side, continuing as first choice until a broken thumb ruled him out for the last two months of the season. With Poole also injured, loanee Thomas Myhre completed the campaign. Undisputed first choice the following season, Bennett helped Birmingham reach the 2001 League Cup Final, in which he made some fine saves in a losing cause as Liverpool won on penalties."]}, {"page": "Steve Hodge", "response": ["The move to Birmingham did work initially but the team was in decline and once Hodge had received England recognition, it was perceived by the Villa fans that he was not fully committed to the team's cause, typified during a 4\u20131 home defeat by Norwich City where his intended back pass to Kevin Poole was slotted in by a Norwich player \u2013 the boos ringing round the ground signalled the beginning of the end for his Villa career.

The move was delayed after Tomlinson picked up a calf injury, before he managed to join Burton in time for a pre-season friendly with Sheffield Wednesday. However Crewe reconsidered the loan deal and so Nigel Clough instead signed aged veteran Kevin Poole. Clough was still keen to sign Tomlinson, with the saga continuing well into the season, though no deal was made. Tomlinson picked up his first senior clean sheet on 22 August 2006, during a 3\u20130 win at Grimsby Town's Blundell Park in the League Cup First Round. The Crewe website described a \"heroic effort\" from Tomlinson in the League Trophy tie with Rochdale on 31 October, as he managed to three of Rochdale's four penalties (the penalty he did not save was a miss). Dario Gradi said: \"Stuart is outstanding on penalties because he is positive and doesn't flop over\". He went on to play seven League One games, and also made one appearance in the FA Cup. However he did not play in the 2007 end of the season, partly due to a torn groin that kept him out of action for a number of weeks. In the summer there was once again talk of a possible loan move to Burton."]}, {"page": "Poole (surname)", "response": ["*Kevin Poole (born 1963), English football player"]}]}}
