Reviews were generally very positive in the United Kingdom. Stuart Kelly in The Guardian called it a \"superior piece of theologically nuanced science fiction\", although he noted that the novel drew a little heavily on Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker and Will Self's The Book of Dave. Author Paul Di Filippo, reviewing the book for Locus magazine, described the plot as uninventive but \"so splendidly [written] it feels brand new and remade\". He pointed out that the novel's \"harsh oasis\" plot device resembled the work of Fritz Leiber, Stephen Baxter, Larry Niven, and Karl Schroeder. But that didn't matter: \"[A]ll this heavy categorizing misses the essence of the reader\u2019s first contact with the book, which is pure astonishment and pleasure, a storytelling ride full of brio and wonder. ... The reader is swiftly seduced by two things that are intrinsic to, but separate from, the powerful plot: the Carrollian language, and the freaky ecology.\" He had high praise for the character of John Redlantern, who was a metaphor (in De Filippo's mind) for both Moses and Cain.
