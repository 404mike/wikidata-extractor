During his career, Lambert served in numerous ships and several military actions with success, participating in the capture of \u00cele Bonaparte in the Indian Ocean as second in command under Josias Rowley. Lambert is best known however for being captain of the frigate HMS Java on 29 December 1812 when she was captured in the Mid-Atlantic by USS Constitution during the War of 1812. Lambert was mortally wounded in the battle and died seven days later in Salvador, Brazil.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "USS Constitution", "response": ["William Bainbridge, senior to Hull, took command of \"Old Ironsides\" on 8 September and prepared her for another mission in British shipping lanes near Brazil, sailing with  on 27 October. They arrived near S\u00e3o Salvador on 13 December, sighting  in the harbor.Hollis (1900), pp. 177\u2013178. Bonne Citoyenne was reportedly carrying $1.6 million in specie to England, and her captain refused to leave the neutral harbor lest he lose his cargo. Constitution sailed offshore in search of prizes, leaving Hornet to await the departure of Bonne Citoyenne.Hollis (1900), pp. 178\u2013179. On 29 December, she met with  under Captain Henry Lambert. At the initial hail from Bainbridge, Java answered with a broadside that severely damaged Constitutions rigging. She was able to recover, however, and returned a series of broadsides to Java. A shot from Java destroyed Constitutions helm (wheel), so Bainbridge directed the crew to steer her manually using the tiller for the remainder of the engagement.Toll (2006), p. 376. Bainbridge was wounded twice during the battle. Javas bowsprit became entangled in Constitutions rigging, as in the battle with Guerriere, allowing Bainbridge to continue raking her with broadsides. Javas foremast collapsed, sending her fighting top crashing down through two decks below.Jennings (1966), p. 235."]}, {"page": "William Bainbridge", "response": ["On 29 December 1812, Bainbridge fell in with the 38-gun , off the coast of Brazil. Java was a vessel armed with 18-pounders and of 1,083 tons, formerly the French frigate Renomm\u00e9e.Barnes, 1896 p. ixHickey, 1989 p. 96 She had a crew of 300 men under Captain Henry LambertBarnes, 1896 p.84 and was on her way to the East Indies, carrying the newly appointed Lieutenant-General Hislop of Bombay and his staff along with dispatches to St. Helena, Cape of Good Hope and every British port in the Indian and China Seas.Harris, 1837 pp. 153\u2013154 She had an inexperienced crew with only a very few trained seamen, and her men had only had one day's gunnery drill. In addition to her crew, Java was carrying officers and seamen who were to join the British fleet in the East Indies bringing her complement to around 400, among them Captain John Marshall who was to take command of a sloop of war stationed there.Harris, 1837 p.147 Under Bainbridge, Constitution had a well-drilled crew. Java was cut to pieces, with its rigging almost completely destroyed, and was forced to surrender, while having inflicted moderate damage to Constitution, including removing Constitutions helm with shot and hitting the lower masts (which did not fall because of their large diameter). During the action, Bainbridge was wounded twice, but maintained command throughout. Java fought extremely well as compared to the Guerriere and Macedonian which had been taken earlier that year by similarly overwhelming force. Java successfully outmaneuvered the large Constitution until her jib was shot away. If  Constitution had been built with smaller diameter masts, she would have been dismasted. Fortunately, Constitution's masts were so wide that the smaller 18 lb shot from Java could not penetrate them. After three hours of intense fighting, Constitution prevailed. Bainbridge replaced the missing helm on Constitution with the one from Java before she was destroyed and sank.  To this day, the still-commissioned Constitution (moored in Boston Harbor) sports the helm that Bainbridge salvaged from Java. Java's crew was taken prisoner and put aboard Constitution in the hold. Because of the heavy damage inflicted on Java and the great distance from the American coast, Bainbridge decided to burn and sink the British frigate. On March 3, 1813, President Madison presented Bainbridge with the Congressional Gold Medal for his service aboard Constitution.Harris, 1837 pages 170\u2013171"]}, {"page": "War cabinet", "response": ["* Henry Lambert (Colonial Office, from Great Britain)"]}, {"page": "The Fortune of War", "response": ["Aubrey knew Captain Yorke and Maturin quickly warms to this captain who travels with an extensive library and a piano in his cabin.

During the night the pilot became lost; the boats were scattered in high winds and had not reassembled by dawn. To distract French attention from the drifting boats, Pym directed Captain Henry Lambert in Iphigenia to sail conspicuously off Port Napoleon, where the main body of the French squadron, led by Hamelin in V\u00e9nus, was based. Pym joined Lambert later in the day and the frigates subsequently returned to the waters of Grand Port by different routes, confusing French observers from the shore as to British intentions. By 13 August, the boats originally intended for the attack had still not been assembled and Pym decided that he could not risk waiting any longer without the French launching a counterattack.James, p. 274 Launching his own boats at 8:00 pm, guided by the pilot and commanded by Pym's second in command, Lieutenant Norman, Pym's marines and sailors landed on the island in darkness under heavy fire from the defenders. Norman was killed in the initial exchange of fire, but his deputy, Lieutenant Watling, seized the island by storming the fortifications surrounding the battery.

On 24 April, Willoughby sighted the recently arrived Astr\u00e9e, and on 30 April attacked the protected anchorage at Jacolet. His target was a large French merchant ship protected by two batteries and a detachment of regular infantry. Landing at night under heavy fire, Willoughby's men seized one battery, drove off a French attack on their beachhead and captured the second battery despite having to advance across a river, under fire, in broad daylight. On returning to their boats, Willoughby's men were attacked by a second French force which they also routed and drove more than a mile inland. Shortly afterwards however, Willoughby was seriously wounded when a musket he was firing exploded, shattering his jaw. As a result, he was forced to spend several months recovering from his injuries on Rodriguez.", "Willoughby stormed \u00cele de la Passe on 13 August and captured it, blocking the entrance to Grand Port. With the harbour secure, Willoughby raided along the coastline while Pym, reinforced by Henry Lambert in Iphigenia and Lucius Curtis in Magicienne, blockaded Port Napoleon. On 20 August, sails were spotted approaching Grand Port and Willoughby determined to trick the approaching ships into entering the channel under \u00cele de la Passe, where he could attack and capture them. The squadron was Duperr\u00e9's squadron returning from the African coast with their prizes and, despite misgivings from Captain Bouvet, Duperr\u00e9 was determined to enter Grand Port and reassured by recognition signals flown by Willoughby, who had captured the French codes on \u00cele de la Passe. As the French passed the fort, Willoughby sprang his trap and opened fire, but a false French tricolour flying from \u00cele de la Passe accidentally ignited as it was lowered.

Duperr\u00e9 successfully broke through Pym's ships however, and took shelter within the harbour. Pym gathered his frigates together and sailed directly into the harbour on 22 August to engage the French. Lacking harbour pilots, Pym's HMS Sirius, Henry Lambert's HMS Iphigenia and Magicienne were soon aground on the coral reefs that sheltered the bay, and the remaining British ship, Nesbit Willoughby's HMS Nereide, was forced to surrender by the French frigates in the port. Of the grounded ships, only Iphigenia sailed again, captured by Hamelin five days later. Sirius and Magicienne were burnt, their crews taking shelter on the tiny \u00cele de la Passe.
