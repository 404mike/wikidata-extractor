Within 15-minutes, the U's found themselves 2\u20130 down with both goals coming from Cheltenham's Kevin Dawson. Colchester were awarded a penalty in the 26th minute after Taylor Moore handled in the penalty area and Sammie Szmodics converted to score his fifth goal of the campaign. In the second-half, Mikael Mandron was sent off for a hand ball offence in the penalty area, but Brian Graham's penalty was saved by Sam Walker. Shortly afterwards, Jamie Grimes scored to complete the victory for Cheltenham and condemn Colchester to their fourth successive away defeat."]}]}}
