He managed to fought off competition from new signing Paul Black. Bakayogo started the season well when he scored his first goal in over a year, in a 3\u20131 win over Leyton Orient in the opening game of the season. Bakayogo then scored his second goal of the season, in a 4\u20130 win over Colchester United on 1 September 2012. After the match, Manager Ronnie Moore said: \u201cZoum has the energy to get into scoring positions and to get back. His was a great finish.\u201d He then set up a goal for Jake Cassidy, who later scored twice, in a 5\u20132 win over Crawley Town on 22 September 2012. Due to Black's return from injury, Bakayogo began to \"play into a more attacking role\" for the side, which Manager Moore said: \"Once Paul has some sort of fitness we will have the option of playing him at left back so we can push Zoumana Bakayogo further forward into the wide midfield role\".<bt> His third goal for the club of the season came on 12 January 2013, in a 2\u20130 win over Crawley Town. His performance led the club to begin negotiating with Bakayogo over a new contract. In a match against Stevenage on 24 March 2013, Bakayogo scored twice for the side, in a 3\u20131 win, adding his tally to five goals this season. For his performance in the 2012\u201313 season, where he made fifty\u2013two appearances and scoring five times for the side, Bakayogo was awarded the fans\u2019 player of the season and players\u2019 player of the season awards."]}, {"page": "Paul Black", "response": ["Paul Black may refer to:", "*Paul Black (musician) (born 1959), American singer and drummer", "*Paul Black (Scottish footballer) (born 1977), former footballer with Dundee United", "*Paul Black (English footballer) (born 1990), footballer with the Carolina RailHawks", "*Paul Black (author) (born 1957), American science fiction author", "*Paul Black (director) (born 1967), British-Canadian film director", "*Paul Black (educational researcher) (born 1930), British educational researcher"]}, {"page": "Paul Black (footballer born 1990)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Black (English footballer)"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": [" | align=left|21 || align=left|DF || align=left|Paul Black"]}, {"page": "All-time North Carolina FC roster", "response": ["*  Paul Black"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"right\"|3||||DF||align=\"left\"|Paul Black"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["March began with a sixth straight defeat, with the club losing 2\u20130 at home to Colchester United. Two second-half Jabo Ibehre goals proved to be the difference. Just three days later, on 5 March, Stevenage ended their run of defeats by beating high-flying Brentford 1\u20130 at Broadhall Way. Having dominated the match for large spells, the home side took the lead with fifteen minutes left when Marcus Haber dinked the ball over Simon Moore in the Brentford goal. Stevenage then lost 2\u20130 away to Preston North End on 9 March, with goals from Lee Holmes and Will Hayhurst in the opening fifteen minutes settling the match. Another defeat followed three days later, with the club losing 1\u20130 at home to Bournemouth. A first-half Brett Pitman penalty was the only goal of the game, as Darius Charles was sent-off late-on for a second bookable offence. Stevenage's next match, played four days later, was a 4\u20130 home victory over second-placed Sheffield United. Returning from a loan spell at Barnet, striker Dani L\u00f3pez made his first start for the club; opening the scoring just before half-time after turning Neill Collins inside the area and beating George Long in the Sheffield United goal. He then added a second shortly after the interval when he neatly converted a chipped through ball by Gavin Mahon.  L\u00f3pez scored his hat-trick just after the hour mark when Anthony Grant broke free and played a through ball to the Spanish forward, who then unleashed an unstoppable shot from just inside the area. Lucas Akins added Stevenage's fourth goal of the match with twenty minutes to go when he cut inside and beat Long with a low curling shot. Just three days after the club's impressive win over Sheffield United, Stevenage lost 2\u20130 to bottom-placed Bury at Gigg Lane. Goals from Craig Jones and Jonson Clarke-Harris, both of which coming within the final ten minutes of the match, proved to be the difference. Stevenage goalkeeper Steve Arnold also saved a first-half Steven Schumacher penalty. A day after the defeat by Bury, on 20 March, Stevenage announced that manager Gary Smith had been sacked following a run of 14 defeats in 18 games. Stevenage captain Mark Roberts was placed in caretaker charge while the club searched for a new manager, but could not prevent a 3\u20131 defeat by Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park on 24 March, a game that was televised live on Sky Sports. Tranmere went ahead after ten minutes when Zoumana Bakayoko tapped in from close range, before Stevenage equalised almost instantly courtesy of a curling Luke Freeman free-kick. Just three minutes later, on the fifteen-minute mark, Tranmere had regained their lead; Stevenage failed to clear a Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro shot and the ball fell to defender Ben Gibson, whose shot went in following a deflection off David Gray. Bakayoko then doubled his goal tally and Tranmere's advantage shortly before the interval when he tucked away Paul Black's through pass. Five days later, Roberts took charge of the side for their trip to Broadfield Stadium to face Crawley Town. Full back Miguel Comminges was sent-off for two bookable offences after just half an hour. Despite being a man light, Stevenage took the lead just before the interval when David Gray headed on Luke Freeman's free-kick, and Roberts was on hand to head the ball into the goal from six yards. Crawley equalised ten minutes into the second-half after Matt Sparrow tucked the ball into the bottom corner of the goal. Both sides had chances to take all three points, but the game ended 1\u20131. A day after the draw to Crawley, on 30 March, Stevenage announced that Graham Westley had been re-appointed as the club's new manager, his third spell in-charge of the Hertfordshire side."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|5 July 2012|| Paul Black||||Oldham Athletic||1 July 2013||Free", "|29 April 2013|| Paul Black||||Released||Mansfield Town||Free", "| 3 |||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Paul Black"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Paul Black"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["|6 || ||DF ||Paul Black|| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0", "| Paul Black"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Paul Black "]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Cheltenham Town F.C. season", "response": ["|24 June 2014|| Paul Black||||Mansfield Town||1 July 2015||Free", "|19 January 2015|| Paul Black||||Released||Atlanta Silverbacks||Free"]}, {"page": "2016 Carolina RailHawks FC season", "response": ["|2 ||||DF||Paul Black||1||0||1||0||0||0||2||0"]}, {"page": "2017 North Carolina FC season", "response": ["| Paul Black", "|2 ||||DF||Paul Black||0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0"]}]}}
