Stead published a series of hugely influential campaigns whilst editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, and he is best known for his 1885 series of articles, The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon. These were written in support of a bill, later dubbed the \"Stead Act\", that raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.Stead's \"new journalism\" paved the way for the modern tabloid in Great Britain. He has been described as \"the most famous journalist in the British Empire.\" He is considered to have influenced how the press could be used to influence public opinion and government policy and advocated \"Government by Journalism\". He was known for his reportage on child welfare, social legislation and reformation of England's criminal codes.\nStead died in the sinking of the RMS Titanic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Magnus Hirschfeld", "response": ["After staying in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), where Hirschfeld caused an uproar by speech comparing Dutch imperialism to slavery, Hirschfeld arrived in India in September 1931. In Allahabad, Hirschfeld met Jawaharlal Nehru and gave speeches supporting the Indian independence movement, stating \"it is one of the biggest injustices in the world that one of the oldest civilized nations... cannot rule independently\". However, Hirschfeld's Indian speeches were mainly concerned with attacking the 1927 book Mother India by the white-supremacist American author Katherine Mayo, where she painted an unflattering picture of sexuality in India as brutal and perverted, as \"England-friendly propaganda\". As Mayo's book had caused much controversy in India, Hirschfeld's speeches defending Indians against her accusations were well received. Hirschfeld, who was fluent in English, made a point of quoting from the articles written by W. T. Stead in The Pall Mall Gazette in 1885, exposing rampant child prostitution in London as proving that sexuality in Britain could also be brutal and perverted: a matter which, he noted, did not interest Mayo in the slightest. Hirschfeld was very interested in the subject of Indian sexuality or, as he called it, \"the Indian art of love\". Hirschfeld's main guide to India was Girindrasekhar Bose and, in general, Hirschfeld's contacts were limited to the English-speaking Indian elite, as he did not speak Hindi or any of the other Indian languages. While staying in Patna, Hirschfeld drew up a will naming Tao as his main beneficiary and asking Tao, if he should die, to take his ashes to be buried at the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin."]}, {"page": "George Meredith", "response": ["Meredith's politics were those of a Radical Liberal, and he was friends with other Radicals such as Frederick Maxse, whom he met around 1860, and John Morley, whom he first encountered in print, as the Literary Gazette's enraptured reviewer of Evan Harrington. Another politically active friend was W. T. Stead, who replaced Morley as editor of the Pall Mall Gazette and was renowned for his campaigning journalism, in particular a crusade against child prostitution. Stead shared with Meredith an aversion to war, a loathing of the \"foul fury of Jingoism\" and \"jingo-Imperialism\" periodically evident in the British press, a hostility to the Russophobia then prevalent in Britain, and an appetite for greater democracy.Joseph O.
