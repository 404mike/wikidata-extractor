Although he only made 11 Football League appearances for the Kent-based club, he was notable for scoring the Gills' first ever league goal, against Southampton in August 1920.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Gillingham F.C.", "response": ["In the club's first match in the newly created Football League Division Three, Gillingham held Southampton to a 1\u20131 draw in front of a new record Priestfield crowd of 11,500, with Tom Gilbey scoring the club's first goal in league competition. Under new manager John McMillan the team struggled and finished the 1920\u201321 season bottom of the table, and in the years to follow there was little improvement, with the club regularly finishing in the lower reaches of the bottom division.  Gillingham did not manage to finish in the top half of the table until 1925\u201326, when the team finished in 10th place, due mainly to the goals of Dick Edmed, who was promptly signed by Liverpool for a fee of \u00a31,750, a new Gillingham record. Manager Harry Curtis departed soon afterwards to take over at Brentford, and former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Albert Hoskins stepped down a division to manage the club, but he could do little to change the team's fortunes and left in 1929 after Gillingham finished bottom of the table once again."]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["Gillingham had played in the Southern Football League since its formation in 1894, apart from when the league was suspended due to the First World War, but had achieved minimal success and had finished bottom of Division One in the 1919\u201320 season. The club escaped relegation, however, as the clubs in the Southern League's top division were admitted en masse to the Football League to form the new Third Division. In preparation for the new season the club signed a number of new players, including Wally Battiste from Grimsby Town, Tommy Hall from Newcastle United, Tom Thompson from Sunderland and Tom Gilbey from Darlington. Only five players who had represented the club in non-league football went on to make appearances in the Football League: Jock Robertson, Jack Branfield, Joseph Griffiths, Donald McCormick and Arthur Wood.", "The club's first ever Football League match was against Southampton at Priestfield Stadium in front of a new club record crowd of approximately 12,000 fans, and ended in a 1\u20131 draw, with Tom Gilbey scoring the Gillingham goal. Four days later the team defeated Reading 2\u20131 away from home to register their first victory, and a week later repeated the feat at home, beating the Berkshire club 1\u20130 to give the club a record of two wins, one draw and one defeat from its first four matches. This was followed, however, by a run of six matches without a win, including a heavy 6\u20131 defeat against Merthyr Town.", "|align=\"left\"|Tom Gilbey"]}, {"page": "List of Gillingham F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["Several players have contributed significantly to the history of the club, despite playing relatively few games.  Tom Gilbey scored the club's first goal in The Football League on the opening day of the 1920\u201321 season.  In 2007, Luke Freeman set records as both the youngest player ever to represent the club and the youngest player ever to play for any club in the rounds proper (i.e. excluding the qualifying rounds) of the FA Cup, aged 15.  Glenn Roeder made seven appearances during a one-season spell as player-manager in the 1992\u201393 season, in which the \"Gills\" narrowly avoided finishing bottom of The Football League and being relegated into non-League football.  Tony Pulis, who played 17 times for the club in the 1989\u201390 season, would return as manager in 1995 and lead the club to promotion from the Football League Third Division.  Players who made few appearances for Gillingham but achieved greater success outside football include Les Ames and Laurie Fishlock, both of whom played Test cricket for England, and Billy Ivison, who played rugby league for Great Britain."]}]}}
