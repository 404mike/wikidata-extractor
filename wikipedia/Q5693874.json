This restriction on people with dual or multiple citizenship being members of parliament does not apply to the state parliaments, and the regulations vary by state. A court case (see Sue v Hill) determined that the UK is a foreign power for purposes of this section of the constitution, despite Australia holding a common nationality with it at the time that the Constitution was written, and that Senator-elect Heather Hill had not been duly elected to the national parliament because at the time of her election she was a subject or citizen of a foreign power. However, the High Court of Australia also ruled that dual citizenship on its own would not be enough to disqualify someone from validly sitting in Parliament. The individual circumstances of the non-Australian citizenship must be looked at although the person must make a reasonable effort to renounce his or her non-Australian citizenship. However, if that other citizenship cannot be reasonably revoked (for example, if it is impossible under the laws of the other country or impossible in practice because it requires an extremely difficult revocation process), then that person will not be disqualified from sitting in Parliament.. In the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, the High Court disqualified Australia's Deputy Prime Minister and four Senators because they held dual citizenship, despite being unaware of their citizenship status when elected."]}, {"page": "Heather Hill", "response": ["Heather Hill may refer to:", "* Heather Hill (politician) (born 1960), Australian former politician", "* Heather Hill (director), American television director and producer"]}, {"page": "Results of the 1998 Australian federal election (Senate)", "response": ["| Heather Hill"]}, {"page": "Re Canavan", "response": ["Section 44(i) was considered by the High Court in 1988, which held in Nile v Wood that it required an identified foreign power..
