In 1896, she began work in anaesthetics at the Birmingham and Midland Hospital for Women. Established in 1871, the hospital was unusual in that constitutionally 50 per cent its committee of management was female. She cared for her aunt, the women's rights activist, Eliza Sturge who died at her house in 1905. Sturge inherited all of her estate. Sturge became acting honorary surgeon in 1905. She worked at the hospital until 1924, when she retired but remained a consulting surgeon."]}]}}
