He scored further major hits including \"Am I That Easy to Forget\" and \"A Man Without Love\". Three of his singles were among the best-selling of the 1960s in the United Kingdom. During the 1970s, he had North American chart successes with \"After the Lovin'\" (1976) and \"This Moment in Time\" (1979).

Many British singers who performed the occasional country songs are of other genres. Tom Jones, by this point near the end of his peak success as a pop singer, had a string of country hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Bee Gees had some fleeting success in the genre, with one country hit as artists (\"Rest Your Love on Me\") and a major hit as songwriters (\"Islands in the Stream\"); Barry Gibb, the band's usual lead singer and last surviving member, acknowledged that country music was a major influence on the band's style. Singer Engelbert Humperdinck, while charting only once in the U.S. country top 40 with \"After the Lovin',\" achieved widespread success on both the U.S. and UK pop charts with his covers of Nashville country ballads such as \"Release Me,\" \"Am I That Easy to Forget\" and \"There Goes My Everything.\" The songwriting tandem of Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway wrote a number of country hits, in addition to their widespread success in pop songwriting; Cook is notable for being the only Briton to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler initially started her career making country records, and in 1978 her single \"It's a Heartache\" reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.
