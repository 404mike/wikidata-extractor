Similarly, the saints' 'lives' therein have little basis in fact. Gilbert Hunter Doble and others have clearly demonstrated that there is no evidence that Saints Dubricius and Teilo had anything to do with Llandaff. Dubricius was only active in Ergyng and Gwent, while Teilo's associations with Llandaff have been transferred from his great abbey at Llandeilo Fawr."]}, {"page": "Gulval", "response": ["The parish is named after a 6th-century saint, Gulval, the original form of which was probably Welvela or Wolvela.
