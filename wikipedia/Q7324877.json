Despite this, little is known about him. He was an exhibitor at the Royal Academy.\nCooper succeeded Alexander Cuzens as Drawing Master at Eton College and taught members of the Royal Family.  Queen Charlotte was England's enthusiastic Patron of the Arts and Queen to King George III. Queen Charlotte was interested in the arts and music. Cooper was her art teacher.\nCooper was taught by his father before moving to Paris to train under the engraver, J. P. Le Bas. Cooper went to Italy around 1770 but by 1778 he was back in Britain.\nOriginal works are rare; The Tate has five original works and five prints; The Government Art Collection has five prints; the National Portrait Gallery, London has one original work and nine prints. The British Museum, however, has over ninety objects attributed to him including ten drawings and seventy four prints.Cooper's work is typically dark, as he specialised in charcoal, pencil, pen and ink. He drew with a reed pen, which he used with rapid and flowing movements to produce strongly contrasted areas of light and shade. The yellow-brown tone of his broad washes suggest the ink used was bistre. The washes were diluted and applied over the iron gall pen work, causing the ink lines underneath to \"bleed\". The sheet is left bare in places to suggest falling sunlight. He would often sketch a scene to complete it in his studio years later.  His subjects include Edward Kynaston, Sir Robert Naunton, John Lilburne, Mary Frith and Daniel Dancer. His landscapes often included the Thames riverbank, and around Windsor Castle, where he used his connections to gain access.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lithography", "response": ["During the first years of the 19th century, lithography had only a limited effect on printmaking, mainly because technical difficulties remained to be overcome. Germany was the main center of production in this period. Godefroy Engelmann, who moved his press from Mulhouse to Paris in 1816, largely succeeded in resolving the technical problems, and during the 1820s lithography was adopted by artists such as Delacroix and G\u00e9ricault. After early experiments such as Specimens of Polyautography (1803), which had experimental works by  a number of British artists including Benjamin West, Henry Fuseli,  James Barry, Thomas Barker of Bath,  Thomas Stothard,  Henry Richard Greville, Richard Cooper, Henry Singleton, and  William Henry Pyne, London also became a center, and some of G\u00e9ricault's prints were in fact produced there. Goya in Bordeaux produced his last series of prints by lithography\u2014The Bulls of Bordeaux of 1828. By the mid-century the initial enthusiasm had somewhat diminished in both countries, although the use of lithography was increasingly favored for commercial applications, which included the prints of Daumier, published in newspapers. Rodolphe Bresdin and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet also continued to practice the medium in France, and Adolph Menzel in Germany. In 1862 the publisher Cadart tried to initiate a portfolio of lithographs by various artists, which was not successful but included several prints by Manet. The revival began during the 1870s, especially in France with artists such as Odilon Redon, Henri Fantin-Latour and Degas producing much of their work in this manner. The need for strictly limited editions to maintain the price had now been realized, and the medium became more accepted."]}, {"page": "Richard Cooper", "response": ["Richard Cooper may refer to:", "*Richard Cooper (American football) (born 1964), American NFL player", "*Richard Cooper (cricketer, born 1945) (1945\u20131990), English cricketer", "*Richard Cooper (cricketer, born 1972), English cricketer", "*Richard Cooper (footballer, born 1965), English footballer", "*Richard Cooper (footballer, born 1979), English football coach and footballer", "*Sir Richard Cooper, 2nd Baronet (1874\u20131946), British Conservative politician", "*Sir Richard Cooper, 1st Baronet (1847\u20131913), British industrial entrepreneur", "*Richard Cooper, the elder (1701\u20131764), English engraver ", "*Richard Cooper Jr. (1740\u20131822), British artist", "*Richard Cooper (academic) (born 1947), British academic", "*Richard Cooper (actor) (1893\u20131947), British actor", "*Richard Cooper (journalist) (born 1946), American journalist", "*Richard Cooper (judge) (1947\u20132005), Federal Court of Australia judge"]}, {"page": "Richard Cooper II", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Cooper Jr."]}, {"page": "Richard Cooper the younger", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Cooper Jr."]}, {"page": "Richard Cooper Jr", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Cooper Jr."]}, {"page": "Richard Cooper, Jr", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Cooper Jr."]}]}}
