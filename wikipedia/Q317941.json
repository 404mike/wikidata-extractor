His death, which occurred on his 32nd birthday, is seen as an act of self-sacrifice when, aware that the gangrene and frostbite from which he was suffering was compromising his three companions' chances of survival, he chose certain death for himself in order to relieve them of the burden of caring for him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire", "response": ["There are a number of local museums, such as the City Museum in Winchester, which covers the Iron Age and Roman periods, the Middle Ages, and the Victorian period over three floors. A \"Museum of the Iron Age\" is in Andover. Southampton's Sea City Museum is primarily focused on the city's links with the Titanic. Basingstoke's Milestones Museum records the county's industrial heritage. There are also a number of national museums in Hampshire. The National Motor Museum is located in the New Forest at Beaulieu. The Royal Navy Museum is part of Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Other military museums include The Submarine Museum at Gosport, the Royal Marines Museum, originally in Southsea but due to transfer to the Dockyard in 2019, the Aldershot Military Museum, the D-Day Story by Southsea Castle and the Museum of Army Flying at Middle Wallop. Several museums and historic buildings in Hampshire are the responsibility of the Hampshire Cultural Trust. Specialist museums include the Gilbert White museum in his old home in Selborne, which also includes The Oates Collection, dedicated to the explorer Lawrence Oates."]}, {"page": "March 17", "response": ["*  1880   \u2013 Lawrence Oates, English lieutenant and explorer (d. 1912)"]}, {"page": "Robert Falcon Scott", "response": ["Deteriorating weather conditions and weak, unacclimatised ponies affected the initial depot-laying journey, so that the expedition's main supply point, One Ton Depot, was laid  north of its planned location at 80\u00b0S. Lawrence Oates, in charge of the ponies, advised Scott to kill ponies for food and advance the depot to 80\u00b0S, which Scott refused to do. Oates is reported as saying to Scott, \"Sir, I'm afraid you'll come to regret not taking my advice.\" Four ponies died during this journey either from the cold or because they slowed the team down and were shot.", "In 2005 David Crane published a new Scott biography in which he comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates \"so wholly obscured by legend\". According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott \"free from the baggage of earlier interpretations\". What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives from the way the world has changed since the \"hopeless heroism and obscene waste\" of the First World War. At the time of Scott's death, people clutched at the proof he gave that the qualities that made Britain, indeed the British Empire, great were not extinct. Future generations mindful of the carnage that started  years later, the ideals of unquestionable duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring."]}, {"page": "1912", "response": ["* March 16 \u2013 Lawrence Oates, dying member of Scott's South Pole expedition, leaves the tent saying, \"I am just going outside and may be some time.\""]}, {"page": "1880", "response": ["* March 17 \u2013 Lawrence Oates, British army officer and Antarctic explorer (d. 1912)"]}, {"page": "Eton College", "response": ["*Lawrence Oates, Antarctic explorer"]}, {"page": "Putney", "response": ["*Cpt.
