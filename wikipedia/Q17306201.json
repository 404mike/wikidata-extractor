In 2014, she curated the exhibition Correspondences \u2013 contemporary painting in response to the life and writing of R. S. Thomas at Plas Glyn-y-Weddw, Pwllheli. The exhibition included work by 14 contemporary artists based in Wales including Kinsey, Osi Rhys Osmond, Iwan Bala, Ivor Davies and Mary Lloyd Jones. The catalogue for the exhibition included poetry by Menna Elfyn and Myrddin ap Dafydd. Later the same year, the exhibition was then amalgamated by curator Lynne Crompton with work from artists responding to Dylan Thomas at Oriel Q Gallery, Narberth. At an event to mark R. S. Thomas\u2019 centenary in 2013, Kinsey was invited by event organisers the University of Wales Press and Swansea University professor M Wynn Thomas (R. S. Thomas\u2019 biographer and executor of his literary estate) to talk about the ways in which the poetry of R. S. Thomas has influenced her art."]}]}}
