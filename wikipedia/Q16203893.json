Written by Terry Nation and directed by Christopher Barry and Richard Martin, this story marks the first appearance of the show's most popular villains, the Daleks, and the recurring Skaro people, the Thals. In the serial, the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) land in an alien jungle and are captured by the Daleks, a race of mutated creatures who survive off the radiation that remains in the atmosphere after a nuclear war with their enemies. As the group attempt to escape the Daleks, they discover more about the planet and the ensuing war, and attempt to broker a peace.", "Show creator Sydney Newman and head of serials Donald Wilson were unhappy with the serial, having wanted to avoid featuring \"bug-eyed monsters\"; however, with no other scripts prepared, they were forced to accept the serial for production. The serial was later brought forward to the second in broadcast order. Due to other sudden commitments, Nation quickly wrote the scripts for the serial at the rate of one per day. On September 16, following Tucker's departure from the show, Christopher Barry was appointed to direct the serial. Lambert's original choice for director was Richard Martin, but Wilson wanted Barry to remain in charge. However, Barry's other work commitments led to a compromise by the production team: Barry would direct the early episodes of the serial, and Martin would trail him to gain more experience. The serial went through a number of working titles during production, including The Survivors and Beyond the Sun, before settling as The Mutants towards the end of production."]}, {"page": "The Edge of Destruction", "response": ["The Edge of Destruction (also referred to as Inside the Spaceship) is the third serial of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It was written by David Whitaker, and first broadcast on BBC TV in two weekly parts on 8 February and 15 February 1964. The first episode was directed by Richard Martin, while Frank Cox directed the second. In the story, the Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) are in the Doctor's time and space machine the TARDIS when it appears to be taken over by an outside force. The travellers begin acting strangely and turn against each other.", "Whitaker wrote the script in two days, describing the process as \"a bit of a nightmare\". He drew upon influences of ghost stories and haunted houses, and producer Verity Lambert felt that the story captured audiences because of the conflict between the characters. To avoid complication with the Writers' Guild, Whitaker only received a writing credit for the serial, omitting his usual credit of story editor. When filming for the serial was deferred for a week due to issues with the previous serial, Russell left the project due to other commitments, temporarily replaced by associate producer Mervyn Pinfield; junior director Richard Martin was later handed the role. Frank Cox directed the second episode, as Martin was unavailable. Raymond Cusick designed the extra rooms in the TARDIS. Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop designed the serial's sounds, while the music was selected from a range of sample mood music from library discs, due to budgetary constraints."]}, {"page": "The Dalek Invasion of Earth", "response": ["The Dalek Invasion of Earth is the second serial of the second season in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who.

Whitaker wanted a strong reason for Susan's departure. To assist the story's development, Ford and Hartnell were invited to stay with Nation and his wife over a weekend in August. In June 1964, head of serials Donald Wilson considered continuing the show without the character of Barbara, and with a younger actress for Susan. Delays by Controller of Programmes Donald Baverstock to renew cast contracts meant that Susan's replacement, then intended to be Jenny (originally known as Saida), could not be introduced in the serial.

Although disappointed with the scripts, Martin observed that they were as close to a fantasy adventure as Doctor Who should get; he felt that they had visual potential, but that the available studio facilities would limit it. He disliked the dialogue and found the scripts too short, working with new story editor Dennis Spooner on amendments. Martin overspent the serial's budget to achieve the desired visuals, which led to conflict with the cost-conscious Lambert. To account for the high cost of the props and costumes, Martin forewent a traditional, original score, instead using recordings of musique concr\u00e8te performances arranged by Jacques Lasry and Fran\u00e7ois Baschet for Les Structures Sonores; Martin found the sounds extraterrestrial, as they were created using glass rods and steel. Lambert edited the final episode as Martin had departed for a holiday shortly after its recording; she edited out a shot of the Carsenome web dissolving, explaining in a memo to Martin that \"I thought nobody would know what on earth was happening\"."]}, {"page": "The Romans (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The concept of a Doctor Who serial set in ancient Rome originated during the planning of the show's second season in early 1964; in April, it was allocated four episodes under the description \"Roman\". The production team decided that it would use The Romans and its preceding episode, The Rescue, to introduce new companion Vicki following the departure of Carole Ann Ford as Susan Foreman; The Rescue was written by outgoing script editor David Whitaker as a two-part introductory story, and The Romans was written by new script editor Dennis Spooner as a further establishing adventure. Whitaker officially commissioned Doctor Who and the Romans on 31 August 1964; Spooner was due to deliver the first two scripts by September and the last two by October. Richard Martin was originally assigned to direct The Romans, but was replaced by Christopher Barry in October 1964 following the decision to use the same production team as The Rescue, forming a single six-episode production block.

Lambert sent the scripts to Martin on 25 February 1965, pleased with their action but concerned about potential production drawbacks; she was primarily concerned with the Mire Beast and Fungoids, having struggled with creatures like the Slyther in The Dalek Invasion of Earth.
