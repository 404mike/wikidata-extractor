It was under these colours that he was elected for Nottingham South in 1935. He lost this seat standing as a 'National Independent' in the 1945 general election, following the official dissolution of National Labour.\nAt the 1950 general election, he stood as the Conservative candidate in the Buckingham constituency, but failed to unseat the sitting Labour Member of Parliament, Aidan Crawley.  However, at the 1951 general election, he beat Crawley by a majority of only 54 votes.  He held the seat with narrow majorities at the 1955 election and at the 1959 election and stood down before the 1964 general election.\nHe was conferred the honour of Knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 June 1953 in the 1953 Coronation Honours.In retirement, he was best noted for his A History of Milton Keynes and District (two volumes) ISBN 0-900804-29-7 (see History of Milton Keynes).

Frank Markham then drafted a list of 35 constituencies in which National Labour wanted to stand for election and wanted the Conservatives to support them. However, the Conservatives objected to many of the entries such as Kensington North and Birmingham Erdington, which were marginal former Conservative seats that had only narrowly gone to Labour in 1929. Local Conservatives refused to withdraw their candidates, and in Liverpool Everton, sitting National Labour MP Derwent Hall Caine found himself opposed (and eventually beaten) by a Conservative. By 14 October, with the close of nominations imminent, persistent Conservative associations and candidates had forced National Labour candidates to withdraw in four constituencies and there were only 25 candidates confirmed, 10 of whom had Conservative opposition.Andrew Thorpe, \"The British General Election of 1931\", Oxford University Press, 1991, pp. 172\u20134.", "Subsequently, Harold Nicolson joined the Labour Party and stood as its candidate in the 1948 Croydon North by-election, which he lost.
