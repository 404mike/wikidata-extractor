It was under these colours that he was elected for Nottingham South in 1935. He lost this seat standing as a 'National Independent' in the 1945 general election, following the official dissolution of National Labour.\nAt the 1950 general election, he stood as the Conservative candidate in the Buckingham constituency, but failed to unseat the sitting Labour Member of Parliament, Aidan Crawley.  However, at the 1951 general election, he beat Crawley by a majority of only 54 votes.  He held the seat with narrow majorities at the 1955 election and at the 1959 election and stood down before the 1964 general election.\nHe was conferred the honour of Knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 June 1953 in the 1953 Coronation Honours.In retirement, he was best noted for his A History of Milton Keynes and District (two volumes) ISBN 0-900804-29-7 (see History of Milton Keynes).  A secondary school in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire - now replaced -  was named after him. He is buried in Calverton Road cemetery, Stony Stratford in Milton Keynes, along with  his wife Frances.", "link_mentions": {}}}
