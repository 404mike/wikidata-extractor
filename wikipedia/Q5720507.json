Though Beer's son Frederick became the owner upon Julius's death in 1880, he had little interest in the newspaper and was content to leave Dicey as editor until 1889. Henry Duff Traill took over the editorship after Dicey's departure, only to be replaced in 1891 by Frederick's wife, Rachel Beer, of the Sassoon family. Though circulation declined during her tenure, she remained as editor for thirteen years, combining it in 1893 with the editorship of The Sunday Times, a newspaper that she had also bought.", "* Henry Duff Traill (1889\u20131891)"]}, {"page": "Frederic George Stephens", "response": ["Almost twenty years later Hunt retaliated by launching a scathing attack on Stephens in the second edition of his Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (1914). In 1894, Stephens published a Portfolio monograph on Rossetti.  He contributed essays on art to Henry Duff Traill's Social England: a Record of the Progress of the People (1893\u201397) placing Pre-Raphaelitism in a continuing tradition of British art.  This contradicted the Brotherhood's view that they had flowered uniquely from a pallid past.  In 1895 he published a book on Lawrence Alma-Tadema and his review of the posthumous exhibition of Millais in 1898 took the painter to task for poorly thought-out works."]}, {"page": "H. D.
