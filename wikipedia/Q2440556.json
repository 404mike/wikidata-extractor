He also managed Falkirk for a few months in 1996.\nBannon gained 11 Scotland caps and played at the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoff Hurst", "response": ["Hurst joined Chelsea, then in the Second Division, before the 1979\u201380 season, initially as assistant manager to Danny Blanchflower. When Blanchflower was sacked, Hurst was appointed manager. He hired Bobby Gould as his assistant. Things initially went well, and for much of the season Chelsea were on course for promotion, but two wins from their final seven league games ensured the club finished fourth; missing out on third place and promotion on goal difference. He raised \u00a3250,000 through the sales of Eamonn Bannon, David Stride and Trevor Aylott. He then spent \u00a3300,000 on Colin Lee, Dennis Rofe and Colin Viljoen; he later acknowledged Viljoen as a mistake whilst bemoaning Lee's bad luck with injury."]}, {"page": "Dundee United F.C.", "response": ["Jim McLean took over from Kerr in 1971 and under his management the club enjoyed the most successful era in its history.

Perhaps the most notable meeting was the final game of the 1982\u201383 Premier Division season, where if United were victors at Dens Park, they would clinch the top flight title; United were victorious thanks to an Eamonn Bannon winner.", "* 1979 Eamonn Bannon", "*  Eamonn Bannon"]}, {"page": "Falkirk F.C.", "response": ["|Eamonn Bannon - Managerial Period & Record, bettermeddle.org.uk.
