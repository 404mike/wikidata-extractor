He attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, but as he was not able to get into the Royal Engineers he left to become an engineer as a civilian, and worked for Humphreys and Sons, consulting engineers as a waterworks engineer on the East Coast of Africa, before becoming a manager of his father's company. During the First World War he served in the Royal Tank Corps and was awarded the Military Cross, re-joining his father's company after the war.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Allen", "response": ["* George W.
