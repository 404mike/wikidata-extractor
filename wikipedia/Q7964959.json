A cousin of W. G. Grace, he played for Gloucestershire when, dominated by the Grace family, it was the leading county. Gilbert's best season was 1876, when he scored 205 not out for the county, but he was subsequently less successful. Closely connected with the United South of England Eleven, a professional touring team of which he eventually became secretary, Gilbert was financially affected by a declining interest in such teams. With insufficient income to continue as an amateur he became a professional in 1886, but played only one match before he was caught stealing from teammates in a minor match, ending his first-class career. After serving a 28-day prison sentence Gilbert moved to Canada, where he worked for the Land Titles Office in Calgary while remaining a prominent cricketer. He died aged 70 in 1924, but for nearly 60 years after his death, there seemed to be a conspiracy of silence over his fate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Grace", "response": ["The English cricket team in Australia in 1873\u201374 is sometimes called W.

It was his last cricket match. He had caught a cold during the Test match which was made worse by being soaked twice during showers at Stroud. He returned home to Downend to try and recuperate but still had the cold on Tuesday, 14 September, when he travelled by train to Basingstoke as he was due to play in a benefit match at Winchester the following day. He took a room at the Red Lion Hotel in Basingstoke. He could not play in the benefit match because his condition had worsened and he became bed-ridden at the hotel where a doctor diagnosed a problem with his right lung. Grace's brother Henry and his cousin Walter Gilbert came to see him, Gilbert remaining with him throughout his illness. There were conflicting reports by telegram about his condition until the morning of Wednesday, 22 September, when he suddenly deteriorated and became critical. Several family members, including WG, set off for Basingstoke but Grace died at 13:15 that day. WG and Henry were told while awaiting a train at Bradford-on-Avon railway station.Rae, p. 256."]}, {"page": "1876 English cricket season", "response": ["|Walter Gilbert || Gloucestershire|| 17 || 27 || 2 || 907 || 205 not out || 36.28 || 2 || 1"]}, {"page": "Walter Gilbert (disambiguation)", "response": ["Walter Gilbert (born 1932) is an American scientist and Nobel laureate.", "Walter Gilbert may also refer to:", "*Walter Gilbert (American football) (1915\u20131979), American football player", "*Walter Gilbert (pilot) (born 1899), Canadian aviator", "*Walter Gilbert (sculptor) (1871\u20131946), English sculptor", "*Sir Walter Gilbert, 1st Baronet (1785\u20131853), British East India Company Army officer", "*Walter Gilbert (cricketer) (1853\u20131924), English cricketer", "*Walter G.
