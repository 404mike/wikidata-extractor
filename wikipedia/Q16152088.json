He became referred to as 'Rockin' Louie II'.Barrett, Paul; Hayward, Hillary (1983). Shakin' Stevens. W. H. Allen (London).  By the mid 1960s however, Barratt had formed his own rock band, named the Olympics, then the Cossacks, then finally the Denims, who became a support act to the Backbeats. When the Denims broke up, Barratt formed a new group named the Rebels. Paul Barrett reluctantly went to see the Rebels after a recommendation early in 1969. Although unimpressed with the band, Barrett saw something in their young singer. He offered to manage Michael Barratt on the condition that he left the Rebels and, secondly, find a new stage name. Barratt agreed, left the Rebels and renamed himself Shakin' Stevens.Heatley, Michael (2005). Shaky. Michael O'Mara Books (London). ", "Barrett would manage Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets until 1977, even appearing on stage with them as a vocalist. When Shaky began rehearsals for Elvis!-The Musical, the Sunsets used Rockin' Louie as their frontman, until Stevens was free from his commitment to the show.  This worked okay until one night at the Rock Garden, London when the audience became disappointed by the non-appearance of Shakin' Stevens and nearly rioted. The venue's management used this to negotiate a rebate from Paul Barrett, a suggestion which nearly ended in a violent confrontation.", "Shaky was willing to call a truce after that court case, Paul Barrett was still angry about the non-payment of royalties from the I'm No J.D. and Rockin' And Shakin'  albums. Barrett reissued both albums on a single CD in 2005 under the uncompromising title of How To Be Awarded Two Gold Records And Not Be Paid A Penny in Royalties, complete with sleeve notes issuing a challenge to both Sony and Universal (who now officially own the rights to the two records) to sue him if they believed their rights had been breached.", "Ever since first managing Shakin' Stevens in 1969, Barrett continued to be a professional agent, manager and promoter of 1950s style rock and roll artists including Charlie Gracie, Wee Willie Harris, Bill Haley's original Comets, the Jets, Matchbox, Crazy Cavan and the Rhythm Rockers, Linda Gail Lewis (sister of all time rock great Jerry Lee Lewis) and The Class of '58. He has promoted and organised weekend long rock and roll themed events and major concerts all over the UK and on mainland Europe. Paul Barrett Rock and Roll Enterprises is now recognised as the principal agency for the genre."]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|31||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Paul Barrett"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Wrexham F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|12||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Paul Barrett"]}]}}
