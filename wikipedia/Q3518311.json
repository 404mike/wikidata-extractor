As an object of gaze, her position contrasted with that of the flaneur and the male privileged code of visual spectatorship.

Metropolitan masculinity was shown to be influenced by the industrial atmosphere of the metropolis. This is well illustrated by Terence Donovan (photographer)`s grainy black and white photographs of sharply suited men in \u201dSpy Drama\u201d for the October 1962 issue of Town which became famous as the visual influence for the filmic interpretation of James Bond. In this period, the representation of the woman in the street was radicalized by the emergence of youth as a social category and its claiming of street culture as its primary context.Shinkle, E.
