He holds the record for holding a peerage for the shortest length of time.\nStamp was born in Hereford, while his father was working there as a civil servant for the Inland Revenue.\nHe was educated at The Leys School, Cambridge, then went up to King's College at Cambridge University, where he graduated as Master of Arts.He became by profession a chartered accountant.Stamp married on 10 December 1929, a fellow Cambridge graduate (BA), Katharine Mary, daughter of Tom Wickett of Redruth, Cornwall.  They had issue three daughters:\nNancy Elizabeth, born 21 June 1931.\nVeronica, born 25 May 1934.\nJessica Catherine, born 21 September 1936.At time of his death he lived near his father at 'Farringleys', Park Hill Road, Shortlands, Beckenham, Kent.\n\nStamp was killed, aged thirty-six, along with his father Josiah Stamp, the second-richest man in Britain at the time, when the latter's house, 'Tantallon' in Park Hill Road, Shortlands, Beckenham, was bombed in 1941 during The Blitz.  Stamp's mother, Olive Jessie Stamp, Baroness Stamp, was killed by the same bomb.  They were buried at Beckenham Cemetery.\nEnglish law has legal fiction that in cases where the order of death is indeterminable, the eldest is recorded to have died first. Legally therefore Wilfred momentarily inherited the peerage of Baron Stamp and the family had to pay death duty twice. Because Wilfred left no sons, the peerage was passed to his father's second son Trevor.\nThe shortest peerage without legal fiction was Charles Brandon, 3rd Duke of Suffolk who inherited his peerage from his brother, Henry Brandon, 2nd Duke of Suffolk for an hour.
