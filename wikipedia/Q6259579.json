Becoming associated with John Ayres, he engraved the most important of his books on calligraphy. He is popularly known as an illustrator of The Pilgrim's Progress.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Herbert", "response": ["The earliest portrait of George Herbert was engraved long after his death by Robert White for Walton's biography of the poet in 1674 (see above). Now in London's National Portrait Gallery, it served as basis for later engravings, such as those by White's apprentice John Sturt and by Henry Hoppner Meyer in 1829."]}, {"page": "James Anderson (lawyer)", "response": ["At this work he laboured for several years with great judgment and perseverance; but it was not completed at his death in 1728. The book was published posthumously in 1739, edited by Thomas Ruddiman, under the title Selectus Diplomatum et Numismatum Scotiae Thesaurus. Ruddiman also produced a translation into Scots. The preparation of this great national work involved the author in considerable pecuniary loss; and soon after his death, the numerous plates, engraved by John Sturt, were sold for \u00a3530. These plates are now lost, and the book has become exceedingly scarce."]}, {"page": "Bernard Lens III", "response": ["Lens, the son of mezzotint engraver Bernard Lens II, was born in London in 1682 and in 1698 became an apprentice to an artist known as Sturt, quite likely his father's partner John Sturt (1658\u20131730).Wieseman, p. 226 Sturt was a member of the Company of Goldsmiths, but the membership was merely a license to work within the City of London, not an indicator of his actual trade."]}, {"page": "William Addy", "response": ["William Addy (fl. 1685) was a writing-master based in London, and the author of a system of shorthand published in 1685. The method, a modification of that of Jeremiah Rich, was so much practised that the Bible, the New Testament, and the Singing Psalms were published, according to its system, two years later. The 1695 edition of his work was entitled Stenographia, or the Art of Short-Writing completed in a far more compendious methode than any yet extant. It was engraved throughout. The Bible was engraved by John Sturt. In subsequent editions of the Bible the preliminary leaves were changed, and the book dedicated to King William. All the title-pages are dated 1687."]}, {"page": "William Humphrey (engraver)", "response": ["Humphrey engraved portraits in mezzotint, some after Robert Edge Pine. That of John Sturt the engraver was after William Faithorne the younger; of Colonel Richard King, after Godfrey Kneller; Mr Mannock, brother of Sir William Mannock, after Samuel Cooper; of Madame Du Barry, from a drawing by Benjamin Wilson; and others. He also etched a few small portraits, and engraved in stipple Cupid and Psyche and Beauty and Time, from his own drawings, and The Nativity of Christ, after John Singleton Copley."]}, {"page": "Sturt (surname)", "response": ["* John Sturt (1658\u20131730), English engraver"]}, {"page": "Sturt, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Sturt"]}]}}
