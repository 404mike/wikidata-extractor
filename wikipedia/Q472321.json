Nitta claimed that the surrounding burial pits were contemporaneous to the jars, as they were cut into the surface on which the jars had been placed. Nitta believed the jars were symbolic monuments to mark the surrounding burials. He dated the Plain of Jars to the late second or early first millennium BC based on the burial urn and associated grave goods. Sayavongkhamdy undertook surveys and excavations between 1994 and 1996, supported by the Australian National University. Sayavongkhamdy and Peter Bellwood interpreted the stone jars as a central person's primary or secondary burial, surrounded by secondary burials of family members. Archaeological data collected during bomb clearance operations supervised by UNESCO archaeologist Julie Van Den Bergh in 2004\u20132005 and again in 2007 provided similar archaeological results.

An older proposal was that Lapita settlers first arrived in Melanesia via eastern Indonesia. Bellwood\u2019s proposal included the possibility that both migration patterns happened, with different migrants taking different routes. Bellwood\u2019s proposal is supported by the pottery evidence: Lapita pottery is more similar to pottery recovered from the Philippines (at the Nagsabaran archaeological site on Luzon Island) than it is to pottery discovered anywhere else. Other evidence suggests that the Luzon area may have been the original homeland of the stamped pottery tradition that is carried forward in Lapita culture.", "The orthodox view, advocated by Roger Green and Peter Bellwood, and accepted by most specialists today, is the so-called \"Triple-I model\" (short for \u201cintrusion, innovation, and integration\"). This model posits that the Early Lapita culture arose as the result of a three-part process: \u201cintrusion\u201d of the Austronesian peoples of the islands of Southeast Asia (and their language, materials, and ideas) into Near Oceania; \u201cinnovation\u201d by the Lapita people, once they reached in Melanesia, in the form of new technologies; and \u201cintegration\u201d of the Lapita peoples into the pre-existing (non-Austronesian) populations.Greenhill, S.

However, the Austroasiatic predecessor of modern Vietnamese language has been proven to originate in modern-day Bolikhamsai Province and Khammouane Province in Laos as well as parts of Ngh\u1ec7 An Province and Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province in Vietnam, rather than in the region north of the Red River delta. Chamberlain demonstrates with textual evidence that many rebel groups during the Tang dynasty originated from the C\u1ea3 River and subsequently pushed northward to the Red River, linking this to the linguistic shift.Chamberlain, J.R. 1998, The origin of Sek: implications for Tai and Vietnamese history\", in The International Conference on Tai Studies, ed. S. Burusphat, Bangkok, Thailand, pp. 97-128. Institute of Language and Culture for Rural Development, Mahidol University. Chamberlain demonstrates, based on the concentration of linguistic diversity of Vietic, the lack of any trace of Austroasiatic in relevant ancient records, or in the neighbouring Tai languages, as well as the short time depth of Proto-Vietic, that \"[t]here is no evidence of Vietic, Proto-Vi\u1ec7t-M\u01b0\u1eddng or other Austroasiatic speakers living in and around Jiaozhi in the lower Red River basin prior to the 10th or 11th centuries.\"Chamberlain, James R.

Phan, John. \"Re-Imagining 'Annam': A New Analysis of Sino\u2013Viet\u2013Muong Linguistic Contact\" in Chinese Southern Diaspora Studies.

For centuries afterward, Zhao Tuo was a folk hero among the Viets, and was remembered for standing up to the Han Empire. After L\u00fd B\u00ed drove the Chinese out of northern Vietnam, he proclaimed himself \"Emperor of Nam Vi\u1ec7t\" (Nam Vi\u1ec7t \u0111\u1ebf; \u5357\u8d8a\u5e1d) in 544, thus identifying his state as a revival of the Nanyue, despite obvious differences in terms of location and ethnic makeup. In the thirteenth century, L\u00ea V\u0103n H\u01b0u wrote a history of Vietnam that used the Tri\u1ec7u dynasty as its starting point, with Zhao Tuo receiving glowing praise as Vietnam's first emperor. In the 18th century, Ng\u00f4 Th\u00ec S\u0129 reevaluated Zhao Tuo as a foreign invader. Under the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, Zhao Tuo continued to receive high praise, although it was acknowledged that the original Nanyue was not in fact a Vietnamese state. The current Communist government of Vietnam portrays Zhao Tuo negatively as a foreign invader who vanquished Vietnam's heroic King An D\u01b0\u01a1ng despite there being a campaign to reconsider the role of Zhao Tuo due to rising tensions between Vietnam and China. Modern Vietnamese are descended from the ancient Yue of northern Vietnam and western Guangdong, according to Peter Bellwood."]}, {"page": "International Cosmos Prize", "response": ["*2021 \u2013 Peter Bellwood"]}, {"page": "Austronesian peoples", "response": ["Regardless certain disagreements still exist among researchers with regards to chronology, origin, dispersal, adaptations to the island environments, interactions with preexisting populations in areas they settled, and cultural developments over time. The mainstream accepted hypothesis is the \"Out of Taiwan\" model first proposed by Peter Bellwood.
