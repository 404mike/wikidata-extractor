They scored more goals than any other team in the division except Manchester City, and scored more at home than any other, but their away record was poor.

Walter Abbott scored 42 goals, of which 34 were scored in the league, a season's best for the Second Division. Both totals remain () club records. Abbott, half back Alex Leake and forward Sid Wharton each played in all 40 league and FA Cup matches over the season, and goalkeeper Henry Clutterbuck and full backs Arthur Archer and Billy Pratt missed only one such game."]}]}}
