He was ordained and began his ministry in Bangor, Gwynedd in 1931, initially as a deacon before becoming a priest in 1932. Although his first language was Welsh, he generally preached in English, and was highly respected as a preacher. He was also a keen visitor to parishioners. After a period as a minor canon of Bangor Cathedral from 1935 to 1938, he was secretary and chaplain to the Archbishop of Wales before becoming Rector of Barmouth in 1946 and then vicar of Llanelltyd (a village near Dolgellau) in 1966, before retiring in 1976.  He was Archdeacon of Merioneth from 1959 to 1976 and was generally known as \"the Arch\" even after his retirement. His successors as Archdeacon, including Barry Morgan (later Bishop of Llandaff and Archbishop of Wales) and Carl Cooper (later Bishop of St Davids), were left in no doubt by parishioners that Thomas was still the real Archdeacon as far as they were concerned. He continued to preach and lead services, in Dolgellau and in Llanelltyd, until well after his 90th birthday, sometimes playing the organ as well. He was described as the oldest working priest in Britain.  He attributed the fact that he rose no higher than Archdeacon to his working-class background and his unmarried status."]}, {"page": "List of Archdeacons of Merioneth", "response": ["*2000-2002 Carl Cooper (afterwards Bishop of St David's, 2002)"]}, {"page": "University of Wales Trinity Saint David", "response": ["*Carl Cooper, Bishop of St David's (Lampeter, French)"]}, {"page": "David Bahati", "response": ["Bahati received a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Makerere University, a Master of Business Administration degree from Cardiff University, an executive certificate in strategic management from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, an executive certificate in campaign leadership from the Leadership Institute, and a diploma in business English from the Manchester Business School.
