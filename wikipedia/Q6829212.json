He studied at the Royal College of Music in London with Archie Camden and Vernon Elliott.  After graduation, he joined the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1959 as second bassoon to Martin Gatt.  In 1962, he won an Arts Council scholarship and left the London Philharmonic to study with the great Italian bassoonist Enzo Muccetti at the Arrigo Boito Conservatory in Parma.  Upon returning to England, he served as principal bassoonist of the newly formed Northern Sinfonia, where he stayed for almost 15 years.  In 1978, he became principal bassoonist of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and he held this post for the next 21 years.  He taught privately, and at University of York, and Trinity College of Music in London.  He made the first recording of Elgar's Romance for bassoon and orchestra Op. 62 with the Northern Sinfonia conducted by Neville Marriner.  Joubert's Bassoon Concerto was commissioned for Chapman. He founded his own reed-making company, applying a skill he learned from Muccetti.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 3", "response": ["*  1934   \u2013 Michael Chapman, English bassoon player (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "Royal Philharmonic Orchestra", "response": ["Among the well-known musicians who have been RPO principals in the mid-1950s and later, string players include Steven Staryk (leader, 1957\u20131959), Raymond Cohen (leader, 1959\u20131966), Alan Loveday (leader, 1967\u20131971), Erich Gruenberg (leader, 1972\u20131976), Barry Griffiths (leader, 1976\u20131989), Jonathan Carney (leader, 1991\u20131994) and Frederick Riddle (viola, 1953\u20131977).

He studied at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Turin, originally with the intention of learning the cello but shifting to the bassoon which was more suited to his small hands.  Although he started out with the Buffet system, he switched to the German system.  His work improving the mechanics of the bassoon was readily accepted by Heckel, which eventually designed and dedicated a special model of bassoon to him, \"Model 41, Special E.M.\"  Heckel built bassoons with three different styles of bells, one of which, the Muccetti bell (also known as the Italian bell), was named after him.  He served as principal bassoonist at La Scala from 1947 to 1971.  After conducting a La Scala concert, Paul Hindemith wrote in his programme \"if all bassoonists were so marvelous, life, and especially writing for the bassoon, would be more of a joy than it usually is.\"  Similarly, Herbert von Karajan wrote after a series of concerts at La Scala, \"I'm pleased to have found a bassoonist of such stature that in almost all European orchestras there is no one to be compared with you.\"  Muccetti was a professor at the Parma Conservatory, where his students included Evandro Dall'Oca (his eventual successor at La Scala), Rino Vernizzi (former principal bassoonist in Orchestra dell'Accademia di Santa Cecilia), Luca Reverberi, (Romano Santi, Michael Chapman and Wendy Philips."]}, {"page": "The Complete Mozart Edition", "response": ["|09||422 509-2||Wind concertos||5||1991, 02||Academy of St Martin in the Fields, Sir Neville Marriner; with Irena Grafenauer, Aur\u00e8le Nicolet, Heinz Holliger, Neil Black, Karl Leister, Jack Brymer, Peter Damm, Hermann Baumann, Alan Civil, Klaus Thunemann, Michael Chapman, and Maria Graf||191/186e, 299/297c, 313/285c, (314)/271k, 314/285d, 315/285e, 371, 386b (412 & 514), 417, 447, 495, 622, App. 9/297B, App. C14.01/297b", "|05||464 8102||Violin concertos; Wind concertos||9||Violin Concertos: New Philharmonia Orchestra \u2013 Sir Alexander Gibson; Academy of St Martin in the Fields \u2013 Iona Brown; with Henryk Szeryng, Nobuko Imai, G\u00e9rard Poulet, Stephen Orton, and Howard Shelley; Wind Concertos: Academy of St Martin in the Fields \u2013 Sir Neville Marriner; with Irena Grafenauer, Aur\u00e8le Nicolet, Heinz Holliger, Neil Black,Karl Leister, Jack Brymer, Peter Damm, Hermann Baumann, Alan Civil, Klaus Thunemann, Michael Chapman, and Maria Graf||190, 207, 211, 216, 218, 219, 261, 269, 271i, 315f, 320e, 364, 373, 191/186e, 299/297c, 313/285c, (314)/271k, 314/285d, 315/285e, 371, 386b (412 & 514), 417, 447, 495, 622, App. 9/297B, App. C14.01/297b"]}]}}
