The May 1982 opening of the Ha\u00e7ienda nightclub, an initiative of Factory Records, was also influential in the development of popular culture in Manchester. For the first few years of its life, the club played predominantly club-oriented pop music and hosted gigs by artists including New Order, Cabaret Voltaire, Culture Club, Thompson Twins, and the Smiths. It had DJs such as Hewan Clarke and Greg Wilson and switched focus from being a live venue to being a dance club by 1986.Dave Haslam, Manchester England, Fourth Estate, London, 2000, p 158 In 1987, the Hacienda started playing house music with DJs Mike Pickering, Graeme Park, and \"Little\" Martin Prendergast hosting \"Nude Night\" on Fridays.John Robb, The North Will Rise Again, Aurum Press, London, 2009, p 233", "The Festival of the Tenth Summer in July 1986, organised by Factory Records, helped to consolidate Manchester's standing as a centre for alternative pop culture.
