Lewton decided to base the film on Algernon Blackwood's 1906 short story \"Ancient Sorceries\". Blackwood's story had a contemporary setting and involved a Medieval architecture-set French town inhabited by a group of devil-worshipping cat people. According to Bodeen, as the rights were about to be purchased, Lewton changed his mind at the last minute and told Bodeen that the film would be set in contemporary New York and involve a love triangle between a man, a foreign woman obsessed with abnormal fears, and a female office worker. According to Tourneur, he was not content with the period setting of \"Ancient Sorceries\", stating, \"if you're going to have horror, the audience must be able to identify with the characters in order to be frightened\". Lewton contributed heavily to the screenplay. During the writing process, Tourneur recalled driving by Lewtown's home in the evening to find a light turned on where Lewton was still working on the screenplay. Bodeen described the screenplay as a \"group project\", saying Lewton had the original idea and wrote the treatment and screenplay, collaborating with Tourneur and Lewton, and later the film's editor Mark Robson. Bodeen concluded that \"Tourneur was entirely responsible for the style of Cat People, but if you read the screenplay you would find everything in the film was in the original script \u2013 and that's simply because it was a group project. Val, Tourneur, myself, Robson \u2013 we all talked about it and I put it down on paper.\" By May 1, 1942 Bodeen had a fifty-page treatment completed for Cat People."]}, {"page": "Bride (disambiguation)", "response": ["*The Bride: the story of Louise and Montrose, Margaret Irwin"]}, {"page": "On Monsieur's Departure", "response": ["In Margaret Irwin's novel Young Bess Elizabeth writes lines from the poem after her lover Thomas Seymour is executed."]}, {"page": "London Mercury", "response": ["The London Mercury also carried short fiction by several well-known authors, including Virginia Woolf, and  Katherine Mansfield, J.
