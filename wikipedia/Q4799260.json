In addition to cricket he was also an accomplished football goalkeeper who played over 100 games in the Football League before turning his hand to management.\nA right-arm fast-medium bowler for Nottinghamshire between 1938 and 1959, he took 1050 first-class wickets, becoming one of the top ten most prolific bowlers in the club's history. He then spent 26 years as an umpire, presiding over four Test matches.\nIn his footballing career he played for non-league sides Newark Town, Mansfield Town, and Grantham Town, before playing for Port Vale either side of World War II. He then spent 1946 to 1948 in the top-flight with Stoke City, before winding down his career following a two-year stint with Lincoln City. He later turned out for non-league sides Northwich Victoria and Gloucester City, and also briefly managed Long Eaton United and Hinckley United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Arthur Jepson || 1,050"]}, {"page": "Michael Holding", "response": ["According to an urban myth, during a Test match between the West Indies and England when Holding was to bowl to English player Peter Willey, the BBC radio commentator at the time, Brian Johnston, described the action as \"The bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey\" (a double entendre, as \"willy\" is British English slang for a penis). However Wisden states that there is no record of Johnston or anyone else actually saying this (although a colleague of Johnston's, Henry Blofeld, has said he recalls the incident occurring during a Test match at The Oval in 1976.) In a limited-overs international between England and West Indies on 26 August 1976 at Scarborough, Michael Holding's return from long-leg deflected off the nearer wicket, breaking the bails, and then scuttled along the pitch to also break the far wicket, with Graham Barlow and Alan Knott, on his only appearance as England's captain, stranded in mid-pitch. This highly unusual occurrence of both wickets being broken by one throw dumbfounded the umpires, David Constant and Arthur Jepson, who rejected the run-out appeal for reasons that still remain obscure, given the undertones of the Test series and the nationality of the umpires (neutral umpires were not introduced until 1994) bias, racial or otherwise, might be considered. The West Indies played 26 first-class matches on the tour, winning 18 and losing only 2, making them the most successful side ever to tour England."]}, {"page": "Gloucester City A.F.C.", "response": ["* Arthur Jepson \u2013 Cricket Test Match Umpire and played cricket for Nottinghamshire CCC."]}, {"page": "David Hughes (Lancashire cricketer)", "response": ["Hughes was born in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, Lancashire.

They lost Bill Voce early in the season to retirement and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness.
