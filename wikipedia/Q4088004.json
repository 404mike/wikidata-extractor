He was a younger brother of the naturalist William Thomas Blanford, both of whom joined the Geological Survey of India in 1855. Henry was the first official meteorologist in India, appointed as Imperial Meteorological Reporter in 1875.Henry was born at 27 Bouverie street, Whitefriars, London where his father ran a workshop for gilt mouldings. His early schooling was at Brighton and Brussels. For a while he studied design at Somerset House and Marlborough House before joining the Royal School of Mines, South Kensington in 1851 and studied under Henry De la Beche, Warington Wilkinson Smyth and John Percy. He was the recipient of a scholarship from the Duke of Cornwall. He then studied for a year at the Bergakademie Freiberg (Mining Academy of Freiberg).\n\nHenry and his brother William joined the Geological Survey of India in 1855 and his first work was to study the coal deposits of Talcher, Orissa (now Odisha). At Talcher he found evidence for the effect of ice in the formation of a boulder bed. From 1856 he was a curator of the Museum of Geology at Calcutta. He was also a delivering lectures at the Presidency College in Calcutta on geology during winters. In 1857 he went to study Cretaceous beds in Tiruchinapalli and near Pondicherry. In 1861, poor health forced him to resign and leave for Europe. He returned the next year to join as a professor of physics and chemistry at the Presidency College, a position that he kept till 1872.His interest in meteorology grew after his appointment as professor of science at the Presidency College from 1862 to 1874. In 1864, cyclones hit eastern India, killing 70,000 and damaging the port of Calcutta. Blanford co-wrote a report on the subject and was subsequently appointed secretary of the commission created to establish a system of storm warnings to protect Calcutta's harbour. Blanford was appointed Imperial Meteorological Reporter and placed in charge of the Bengal Province Meteorological Department, which covered Calcutta, in 1867. The regionalised nature of these local organisations was soon found to be a problem, and in 1875, the India Meteorological Department was founded, with Blanford in charge. The department would gather data across the country, analyse and disseminate information. He initiated publication of the department's scientific results (Report of the Meteorological Reporter) and made long-term weather forecasts using the link between the nature of snow in the Himalayas and rainfall in the rest of India. Using this method, he was able to predict a deficient monsoon in 1885. Blanfords prediction of drought was noticed by the Australian meteorologist Charles Todd and when another drought occurred in 1888, he realised that there was a synchrony in the events. This was examined later by Gilbert Walker who recognised the global scale of weather phenomena.He was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1862, Fellow of the Royal Society in 1880 and was a president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1884\u201385.On 20 June 1867, Henry married Charlotte Mackenzie, daughter of George Ferguson Cockburn of the Bengal civil service and granddaughter of Lord Justice Cockburn. They had three daughters and a son. Poor health forced him to return to England and he died of cancer at Folkestone, Kent in 1893.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal School of Mines", "response": ["* Henry Francis Blanford, meteorologist and palaeontologist.

He named this submerged land Lemuria, as the concept had its origins in his attempts to explain the presence of lemur-like primates (strepsirrhini) on these three disconnected lands. Before the Lemuria hypothesis was rendered obsolete by the continental drift theory, a number of scholars supported and expanded it. The concept was introduced to the Indian readers in an 1873 physical geography textbook by Henry Francis Blanford. According to Blanford, the landmass had submerged due to volcanic activity during the Cretaceous period. In late 1870s, the Lemuria theory found its first proponents in the present-day Tamil Nadu, when the leaders of the Adyar-headquartered Theosophical Society wrote about it (see the root race theory)."]}, {"page": "Gilbert Walker (physicist)", "response": ["Henry Francis Blanford, the founding director of the Indian Meteorological Department, had noticed the pattern that the summer monsoon in India and Burma was correlated with the spring snow cover in the Himalayas and it became a routine to use this to make predictions on the Indian monsoons.  By 1892 however, these predictions began to fail and the second director John Eliot began to use several other correlations including strength of the trade winds, anticyclones, Nile floods and date from Australia and Africa. Eliot's forecasts from 1899 to 1901 failed so badly, with a drought and famine when he predicted higher than normal rains, that he was criticized severely by the newspapers leading to forecasts being made confidential from 1902 to 1905. A growing interest in the work of Lockyer on cycles led him to choose a mathematically inclined successor who would be Walker, despite the lack of experience in meteorology. Eliot himself was an able mathematician, a Second Wrangler at Cambridge, while Walker had been a Senior Wrangler. Walker was an established applied mathematician at the University of Cambridge and gave up a Fellowship at Trinity to take up a position as assistant to the meteorological reporter in 1903. He was elevated to the position of director general of observatories in India in 1904. Walker developed Blanford's idea with quantitative rigour and came up with correlation measures (with a lag) and regression equations (in time-series terminology, autoregression). He set up a group of Indian clerks to calculate correlations between weather parameters. The methods he introduced for time-series regression are now partly named after him (the other contributor was Udny Yule who studied sun-spot cycles) as the Yule-Walker equations. Analyzing vast amounts of weather data from India and lands beyond, over the next fifteen years he published the first descriptions of the great seesaw oscillation of atmospheric pressure between the Indian and Pacific Ocean, and its correlation to temperature and rainfall patterns across much of the Earth's tropical regions, including India. This is now called the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation.

He served as the director-general of Indian observatories from 1899 until his retirement in 1903. He was noted for reorganizing the Indian meteorological department and for his attempts to improve predictions on the monsoons.", "Eliot was born at Lamesley in Durham,  son of Peter Elliott of Lamesley, schoolmaster, by his wife Margaret. He changed the spelling of his surname to Eliot. Matriculating at the rather late age of twenty-six at St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1865, he graduated B.A. in 1869 as second wrangler and first Smith's prizeman. Soon elected to a fellowship, he accepted, owing to weak health and with a view to avoiding the climate of England, the professorship of mathematics at the Engineering College at Roorkee in the North-West Provinces, under the Indian government. In 1872 he was transferred to the regular Indian Educational Service as professor of mathematics at the Muir Central College, Allahabad. With that office was combined that of superintendent of the Meteorological Observatory. In 1874 he migrated to Calcutta as professor of physical science in the Presidency College and meteorological reporter to the government of Bengal. In 1886, he succeeded Henry Francis Blanford as meteorological reporter to the government of India and was appointed in addition director-general of Indian observatories in 1899. Blanford had established a link between snowfall in the Himalayas and the intensity of the monsoons. Famine years were preceded by heavy snowfall in the Himalayas. Eliot took this further by examining correlations between the monsoons and weather in other parts of the world. Eliot however did not use numerical approaches to examine these relations and believed for instance that a high pressure over Mauritius contributed to the intensity of the monsoons. Based on such ideas he began to produce monsoon forecasts that ran to nearly 30 pages. In 1899, his prediction of higher than normal rains led to considerable embarrassment for the government as India suffered a famine. Reviews in the newspapers led to subsequent predictions being issued as confidential reports to the government.  Eliot however improved the organisation of meteorological work in India that had been begun by Blanford. \"The number of observatories working under or in connection with the department was increased from 135 to 240 (including two at an elevation of over 11,000 ft.) and the co-operation of the larger native states was secured. Under Sir John Eliot's superintendence the diffusion of weather information was extended by the issue of frequent reports at various centres. Methods of giving warnings of storms at sea were developed and telegraphic intimations of impending floods to engineers on large works under construction or in charge of railway canals and bridges saved the state from heavy losses. Vast improvement was effected in the mode of announcing . . . prospective drought and consequent danger of famine over greater or lesser areas.\""]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1880", "response": ["# Henry Francis Blanford (1834\u20131893)"]}]}}
