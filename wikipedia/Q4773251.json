Parnes started at the bottom, working in the Stock Exchange as a 'blue button' at A. J. Bekhor. He established a reputation for dealing with the big players of the fringe banking world. Because of his success his colleagues nicknamed him \"The Animal\".Parnes built up the strategic shareholding in Debenhams for Ronson and Sir Philip Harris during Burton's fiercely contested bid for the department\nstore group. That stake helped win the bid for Sir Ralph Halpern, Burton's chairman, in a cliffhanging finish. The vote went in favour of Burton after the bid had been extended from the 3 pm Friday deadline to the following Sunday in a special dispensation by the Takeover Panel. Parnes was a big dealer who acted for some of the biggest names in the share dealing business. After working at stockbrokers A.J. Bekhor, Rowe Rudd and McNally, he became a \"half commission\" man (that is, an introducing broker) with Alexander Laing and Cruickshank. As well as having dealt for various clients, Parnes' relations include the former chief executive of the major British jewellery company Ratners Group Gerald Ratner and the restaurateur and club-owner Richard Caring. Anthony Parnes' son, Michael Parnes, also became a stock broker. Michael Parnes was chief executive of natural resource focused brokerage Old Park Lane Capital.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest Saunders", "response": ["Under his charge, early in 1986, Guinness plc launched a friendly takeover bid for Edinburgh-based Distillers Company plc, which was being stalked by a hostile bidder. This was effected by quietly boosting the Guinness share price. Subsequent to the bid, which resulted in success for Guinness, Saunders was charged (along with Jack Lyons, Anthony Parnes and Gerald Ronson) and convicted on 27 August 1990 of counts of conspiracy to contravene section 13(1)(a)(i) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958, false accounting and theft, in relation to dishonest conduct in a share support operation (see Guinness share-trading fraud). A series of appeals was finally dismissed in December 2002, although a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in Saunders v. the United Kingdom declared that the defendants were denied a fair trial by being compelled to provide potentially self-incriminatory information to Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) inspectors which was then used as primary evidence against them.
