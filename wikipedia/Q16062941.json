The family migrated to Sydney, New South Wales in July 1825. J.A. Jackson was employed as a draughtsman in the Surveyor-General's Department on a salary of \u00a3100. After apparently visiting England, he arrived in Launceston aboard the David Owen in June 1831. He owned two large farms, and in 1833, became the editor of John Pascoe Fawkner's Launceston Advertiser.Jackson was recommended by Sir John Franklin to the Government of South Australia, and was Treasurer in the early days of that colony and Colonial Secretary (succeeding Mr. Robert Gouger) from October 1841 to June 1843, when he resigned owing to a difference with the Governor of the colony, Captain (later Sir) George Grey. Jackson was a nominated member of the South Australian Legislative Council. Returning to Tasmania, he went to London as the official representative of the anti-transportation movement, and contributed towards the success of the agitation for granting responsible government to the Australian colonies by his letters to Earl Grey. It was due to an intimation received from Jackson whilst in London in 1849 that the people of Port Phillip District became aware of the intention of the imperial authorities to despatch a batch of convicts to their settlement. They were thus enabled to initiate the opposition which was successful in preventing Victoria becoming a convict colony. Later on Jackson resided in Melbourne as general manager of the English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank, a post which he held till replaced by Mr. (later Sir) George Verdon in 1872. Mr. Jackson married a daughter of the late W. G. Walker, of Vron Estate, Bishopsbourne, Tasmania, and died at Ealing, near London, in May 1885.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Jackson", "response": ["John Jackson may refer to:", "* John Jackson (painter) (1778\u20131831), British painter", "* John Jackson (engraver) (1801\u20131848), English wood engraver", "* John Jackson (blues musician) (1924\u20132002), American", "* John Jackson (musician), guitarist for the Jayhawks", "* John Jackson, legal name of rapper Fabolous", "* John Jackson (travel writer) (died 1807), British traveler and writer", "* John Jackson (writer), English television writer", "* John Jackson (Pontefract MP) (died 1637), English politician; MP 1624\u20131629", "* Sir John Jackson, 1st Baronet (1763\u20131820), British businessman, MP for Dover and a baronet", "* John Jackson (Richmond politician) (1848\u20131910), member of the Virginia House of Delegates", "* John Jackson (mayor) (1809\u20131887), mayor of Tampa, Florida", "* John Jackson (engineer) (1851\u20131919), British engineer and politician, MP for Plymouth Devonport, 1910\u20131918", "* John Jackson (South East Derbyshire MP) (1919\u20131976), British Conservative politician", "* John Jackson (minister) (1621\u20131693), English nonconformist", "* John Jackson (priest) (died 1717), first chaplain to the garrison at St John's, Newfoundland", "* John Jackson (controversialist) (1686\u20131763), English clergyman", "* John Jackson (Archdeacon of Clogher) (fl. 1762\u20131783)", "* John Jackson (bishop) (1811\u20131885), bishop of Lincoln and of Bishop of London", "* John Jackson (astronomer) (1887\u20131958), Scottish astronomer", "* John Jackson (cricketer, born 1833) (1833\u20131901), English cricketer", "* John Jackson (cricketer, born 1841) (1841\u20131906), English cricketer", "* John Jackson (Worcestershire cricketer) (1880\u20131968), English cricketer", "* John Jackson (cricketer, born 1898) (1898\u20131958), Chilean cricketer", "* John Jackson (baseball) (1909\u20131956), Major League Baseball pitcher, 1933", "*John Jackson (English boxer) (1769\u20131845), English boxer", "*John Jackson (Virgin Islands boxer) (born 1989), Olympic boxer from the Virgin Islands", "*John Jackson (offensive tackle) (born 1965), former NFL offensive tackle", "*John Jackson (wide receiver) (born 1967), former NFL player", "*John Jackson (football manager) (1861\u20131931), first manager of Brighton and Hove Albion", "* John Jackson (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u2013?), Scottish footballer (Clyde, Leeds City, Celtic, Dundee)", "*John Jackson (footballer, born 1906) (1906\u20131965), Scottish football goalkeeper (Partick Thistle, Chelsea)", "*John Jackson (footballer, born 1923) (1923\u20131992), English footballer for Stoke City", "*John Jackson (footballer, born 1942), English football goalkeeper for Crystal Palace", "*John Jackson (sport shooter) (1885\u20131971), American Olympic sport shooter", "*John Jackson (athlete) (born 1941), British steeplechaser", "*John Jackson (speedway rider) (born 1952), British speedway rider", "*John Jackson (racing driver) (born 1964), professional racing driver", "*John Jackson (field hockey) (born 1986), Irish field hockey player", "* John Jackson (trade unionist) (1919\u20131995), British trade union leader", "* John Jackson (businessman) (born 1929), author and campaigner", "* John Jackson (law professor) (1932\u20132015), American law professor at Georgetown University", "* John Jackson (hacker) (born 1994 or 1995), security researcher"]}]}}
