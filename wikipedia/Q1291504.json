Regarding the question of whether there had been a breach of section 77 of the FOIA or its equivalent in the EIR, the ICO stated \"Although the emails referred to above indicated prime facie evidence of an offence, the Commissioner was unable to investigate because six months had passed since the potential offence was committed, a constraint placed on the legislation by the Magistrates Court Act 1980.\" On the more general issue of emails suggesting that attempts to circumvent the legislation had been considered, and a lack of openness, the ICO would \"now consider whether further action is appropriate to secure future compliance.\" In an opinion piece, Edward Acton, Vice-Chancellor of the UEA, commended legislation in the US where \"the FOI distinguishes between recorded factual material necessary to validate research findings, which must be disclosed, and \u2018preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews [and] communications with colleagues\u2019, which are exempted.\""]}, {"page": "February Revolution", "response": ["On the home front, a famine loomed and commodities became scarce, due to the overstretched railroad network. Meanwhile, refugees from German-occupied Russia came in their millions. The Russian economy, which had just seen one of the highest growth rates in Europe, was blocked from the continent's markets by the war. Though industry did not collapse, it was considerably strained and when inflation soared, wages could not keep up. The Duma, which was composed of liberal deputies, warned Tsar Nicholas II of the impending danger and counselled him to form a new constitutional government, like the one he had dissolved after some short-term attempts in the aftermath of the 1905 Revolution. The Tsar ignored the advice. Historian Edward Acton argues that \"by stubbornly refusing to reach any modus vivendi with the Progressive Bloc of the Duma... Nicholas undermined the loyalty of even those closest to the throne [and] opened an unbridgeable breach between himself and the public opinion.\" In short, the Tsar no longer had the support of the military, the nobility or the Duma (collectively the \u00e9lites), or the Russian people. The inevitable result was revolution."]}]}}
