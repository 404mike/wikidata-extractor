Regular contributions come from Josie Long, Chris Addison, Ricky Gervais, Richard Dawkins, Simon Singh and Philip Jeays. In 2009, Ince organised two events with Josie Long, called Darwin's Birthday Spectacular, marking both the scientist's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his book On the Origin of Species.

The bulk of recording had taken place by Summer 2010, with additional recording, mixing and mastering carried out towards the end of 2010. The Indelicates reported at the time that they were seeking financing to turn the album into a feature film, and later self-published David Koresh Superstar: An Unfilmable Screenplay. To promote the album ahead of its release, the band made available preview track \"Something's Goin' Down in Waco\", and created a video game, Super David Koresh Attack.", "At PopMatters, Maria Schurr called David Koresh Superstar the Indelicates' \"most ambitious undertaking to date\" and that they had \"done a stunning job at making history intriguing\". In particular Schurr praised Julia and Simon's \"strong, dramatic singing voices [as] suited to the material\" while noting that Simon's American accent as Koresh was \"convincing enough\" but overindulgent during the album's second song, \"The Road From Houston to Waco\". She also praised the performances of Philip Jeays (as an ATF member) and Jim Bob (playing Timothy McVeigh). Schurr said that the album's high point was \"Something's Goin' Down in Waco\", which \"gives a vivid illustration of the rapidly escalating events\" and concluded that while Koresh \"peaks and dives\" and may \"drag a bit\", it was worth persevering with for the closing track, a \"blistering rendition\" of the folk song \"John the Revelator\"."]}, {"page": "Dusty Limits", "response": ["Dusty Limits is from Brisbane, Queensland, Australia,arts hub  where he first appeared in cabaret.
