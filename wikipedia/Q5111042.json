As a result of needing a majority in all three houses, the General Synod rejected the motion. Following the rejection of the 'take note' motion, the Archbishops of Canterbury and of York called for the need of a \"radical new Christian inclusion\" that is \"founded in Scripture, in reason, in tradition, in theology and the Christian faith as the Church of England has received it; it must be based on good, healthy, flourishing relationships, and in a proper 21st century understanding of being human and of being sexual\". In June 2017, the two Archbishops announced the appointment of a Pastoral Advisory Group and an Episcopal Teaching Document Group. The Pastoral Advisory Group aims to support and advise dioceses on the \"current pastoral approach of the Church to human sexuality\", with a focus on same-sex couples; the chair is Christine Hardman, Bishop of Newcastle. The Episcopal Teaching Document Group aims to create a \"major teaching document on marriage and sexuality\" to be endorsed by the House of Bishops; the chair is Christopher Cocksworth, Bishop of Coventry."]}, {"page": "Lords Spiritual", "response": ["In the 19th century, the dioceses of the Church of England began gradually to come under review again. However an increase in the bench of bishops was not considered politically expedient, and so steps were undertaken to prevent it. In 1836, the first new bishopric was founded, that of Ripon; but it was balanced out by the merger of the Bishoprics of Bristol and Gloucester. (They were later divided again.) The creation of the Bishopric of Manchester was also planned but delayed until St Asaph and Bangor could be merged. They never were; but in 1844, the Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847 went ahead anyway with an alternative means to maintain the 26-bishop limit in the House of Lords: the seniority-based proviso which has been maintained to this day. However, the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 gives any woman appointed a diocesan bishop in England during the next decade priority in terms of succeeding those among the current 21 who retire during that period. Rachel Treweek became Bishop of Gloucester and the first woman Lord Spiritual under the Act in 2015; Christine Hardman became the second later that year."]}, {"page": "Bishop of Newcastle (England)", "response": ["The office has existed since the founding of the diocese in 1882 under Queen Victoria by division of the diocese of Durham.
