He was an elder at Lady Glenorchy's Church which stood in the grounds of the original orphanage. When the idea of a new railway station in Edinburgh, requiring the demolition of both the orphanage and the church, arose in the early 1830s, he contrived a plan, along with his church patron, Lady Glenorchy, to combine her funds with the compensation from the railway company (ensured in an Act of 1836) to build a very generous new orphanage in the clean country air, west of the city. The Lord Provost, John Learmonth, was pulled into the idea around 1833, and he agreed to gift the land required for the project. He was however partially using this philanthropic gesture as a carrot to his fellow town councillors to allow development of the remaining land for housing (the area now known as Learmonth). Bonar appears to have also provided funds himself, either on a permanent basis, or as a bridge while awaiting the railway compensation. The result was a building costing at least double what the original expected budget was. This allowed for a truly well-built building in dressed ashlar sandstone, with two feature bellcotes.Grant's Old and New Edinburgh vol2"]}, {"page": "Andrew Bonar", "response": ["He was born at Paterson's Court in the Broughton districtEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1810 of Edinburgh, the son of James Bonar (1758\u20131821), a solicitor with the Excise, and his wife Marjory Pyott Maitland (1753\u20131834).

This also required the removal of the nearby Lady Glenorchy's Church, the old Edinburgh orphanage, and Trinity College (a separate building from the Kirk). James Bonar WS was an elder at Lady Glenorchy's and an Edinburgh lawyer. He drew up legal papers requiring the railway company to fund the rebuilding of each structure, and in the case of Trinity College Kirk, he argued that it should be dismantled and rebuilt rather than copied. The railway company were not used to such strongarm tactics but signed this, leading them to underwrite large parts of the cost of Lady Glenorchy's Free Church, relocated to Greenside 500m north, the Dean Orphanage on what was then a rural site to the west. The fairly unique plan for Trinity College Kirk required that the stones be numbered prior to demolition and then stored to await a suitable site for rebuilding.Grant's Old and New Edinburgh vol 1", "From a purely functional point of view the Council would certainly have seen the expenditure of \u00a311000 on a church for only 150 people as a waste of money, but their hands were tied by the legal contracts. The chosen site linked to the City Improvement Schemes and in particular the new street at Jeffrey Street, and the medieval edifice was originally given pride of place, as the first building on Jeffrey Street.

The fate of the original church was sealed by the Act of Parliament of 1836 which cleared the site for the building of Waverley Station but Bonar's web of contracts firmly protected the church's needs.", "However, this left the established Church of Scotland portion of the congregation without a home, and a three-way legal debate began between the railway company and the two halves of the congregation (as the railway company had never intended to agree to build two churches). This was eventually resolved in 1856 when the Church of Scotland congregation found premises on Roxburgh Place to the south. James Bonar (although now in the Free Church) resolved this issue and the congregation formally moved to Roxburgh Place in 1859.", "Ironically, the only picture of Lady Glenorchy's Chapel dates from 1846 (right) and was taken by Hill & Adamson whose studio was only 100m away. The photo is misidentified in some sources as \"the orphan hospital\", which had already relocated to Dean Orphanage as the first use to decant the site in the 1830s (again under the skilful guidance of James Bonar who secured a truly spectacular building at railway company cost).
