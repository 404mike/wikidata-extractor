Spoto characterised Bates's sexuality as ambiguous, and said, \"he loved women but enjoyed his closest relationships with men\". Even after homosexuality was partially decriminalised in Britain in 1967, Bates rigorously avoided interviews and questions about his personal life, and even denied to his male lovers that there was a homosexual component in his nature. While throughout his life Bates sought to be regarded as a ladies' man or at least as a man who, as an actor, could appear attractive to and attracted by women, he also chose many roles with an aspect of homosexuality or bisexuality, including the role of Rupert in the 1969 film Women in Love and the role of Frank in the 1988 film We Think the World of You."]}, {"page": "1976 in sports", "response": ["** Men's champion: John Curry, Britain"]}, {"page": "Ambidexterity", "response": ["In figure skating, most skaters who are right-handed spin and jump to the left, and vice versa for left-handed individuals, but it also down to habit for ballerinas. Olympic Champion figure skater John Curry notably performed his jumps in one direction (anti-clockwise) while spinning predominantly in the other. Very few skaters have such an ability to perform jumps and spins in both directions, and it is now considered a \"difficult variation\" in spins under the ISU Judging System to rotate in the non-dominant direction. Michelle Kwan used an opposite-rotating camel spin in some of her programs as a signature move. No point bonus exists for opposite direction jumps or bi-directional combination jumps, despite their being much harder to perfect. Nobody can perform a jump sequence (because it requires change of edge, whereas a combo is maintained on the same edge) from clockwise to anti-clockwise, or vice versa."]}, {"page": "1976 Winter Olympics", "response": ["*Elegant British figure skater John Curry altered his routine to appeal to Olympic judges, winning gold.Olympic.org"]}, {"page": "World Figure Skating Championships", "response": ["| 1975 ||  Colorado Springs ||  Sergei Volkov ||  Vladimir Kovalyov ||  John Curry", "| 1976 ||  Gothenburg ||  John Curry ||  Vladimir Kovalyov ||  Jan Hoffmann"]}, {"page": "Arnold Gerschwiler", "response": ["He also coached the British skaters John Curry, 1976 Olympic and world champion, and Valda Osborn, British champion in 1952 and 1953 and European champion in 1953.

She began training with Peter Burrows instead. She was pleased with their work together and wanted to bring him to the Olympics as her coach of record.
