In addition to forging links within the university, Parker set about creating links with the community, such as schools programmes. On the research side, Parker established the Genetics Garden in 1998, and oversaw the planning of the Sainsbury Laboratory which was officially opened in 2011. His major research interests have been in evolutionary genetics. He was a Fellow and then Emeritus Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge.
