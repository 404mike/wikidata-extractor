However, they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature; instead, they state that cult films are united in their \"subcultural ideology\" and opposition to mainstream tastes, itself a vague and undefinable term.  Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt, and they have little in common except for their celebration of nonconformity\u00a0\u2013 even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist, albeit unintentionally.  At the same time, they state that bourgeois, masculine tastes are frequently reinforced, which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie, rather than a rebellion against it.  This results in an anti-academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies, such as defamiliarization.  This contradiction exists in many subcultures, especially those dependent on defining themselves in terms of opposition to the mainstream.  This nonconformity is eventually co-opted by the dominant forces, such as Hollywood, and marketed to the mainstream.  Academic Xavier Mendik also defines cult films as opposing the mainstream and further proposes that films can become cult by virtue of their genre or content, especially if it is transgressive.  Due to their rejection of mainstream appeal, Mendik says cult films can be more creative and political; times of relative political instability produce more interesting films.", "Mark Shiel explains the rising popularity of cult films as an attempt by cinephiles and scholars to escape the oppressive conformity and mainstream appeal of even independent film, as well as a lack of condescension in both critics and the films; Academic Donna de Ville says it is a chance to subvert the dominance of academics and cinephiles.  According to Xavier Mendik, \"academics have been really interested in cult movies for quite a while now.\"  Mendik has sought to bring together academic interest and fandom through Cine-Excess, a film festival. I. Q. Hunter states that \"it's much easier to be a cultist now, but it is also rather more inconsequential.\"  Citing the mainstream availability of Cannibal Holocaust, Jeffrey Sconce rejects definitions of cult films based on controversy and excess, as they've now become meaningless.  Cult films have influenced such diverse industries as cosmetics, music videos, and fashion.  Cult films have shown up in less expected places; as a sign of his popularity, a bronze statue of Ed Wood has been proposed in his hometown, and L'Osservatore Romano, the official newspaper of the Holy See, has courted controversy for its endorsement of cult films and pop culture.  When cities attempt to renovate neighborhoods, fans have called attempts to demolish iconic settings from cult films \"cultural vandalism\".  Cult films can also drive tourism, even when it is unwanted. From Latin America, Alejandro Jodorowsky's film El Topo (1970) was attracted attention of rock musicians such as John Lennon, Mick Jagger, and Bob Dylan."]}, {"page": "Begotten (film)", "response": ["Begotten has gradually developed a cult following over the years and is considered by some to be the director's masterpiece. As one film critic noted, Begotten  \"earned its reputation as an endlessly provocative and mystifying experience always centuries ahead of the rest of American cinema\". It was listed in the 2011 book 100 Cult Films by Ernest Mathijs and Xavier Mendik over Mendik's objections, as he felt its following was too small to merit inclusion. However, it ultimately made it in because, to Mathijs, its following represented \"the real sectarian cult; it's a very small committed group of people. It's like a secret handshake that goes worldwide. If you've seen Begotten, you're in that cult.\" "]}, {"page": "Special Effects (film)", "response": ["Film scholars Xavier Mendik and Stephen Jay Schneider noted the self-reflexivity present in the film: \"Special Effects is particularly significant in terms of its use of self-reflexive techniques usually associated exclusively with underground cinema. It continues Cohen's interrogation and extension of motifs contained within the films of Alfred Hitchcock, but they are here mediated within the mode of the former's cherished 'guerrilla cinema'.\" They also added that the film is \"particularly instructive in showing how low-budget underground film using a narrative structure can interrogate the negative effects of the male gaze and, at the same time, deliver a form of visual pleasure that is not compromised by the dominant ideology.\" They also likened elements of the film to Hitchcock's Juno and the Paycock (1930) and Vertigo (1958)."]}, {"page": "Mendik", "response": ["*Xavier Mendik (born 1967), English documentary filmmaker"]}, {"page": "Cine-Excess", "response": ["The Cine-Excess International Film Festival and Convention is a UK film festival about cult films that features a themed conference, open discussions, and screenings.
