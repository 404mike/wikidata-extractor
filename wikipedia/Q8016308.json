He was educated at both the The Cathedral School in Llandaff and the Exeter Cathedral School. From there he went up to St John's College, Cambridge. After graduating from Cambridge in 1899, McCormick initially gained employment as an assistant master at Rose Hill School in Tunbridge Wells. However, in 1900 he pursued an ecclesiastical career in the Church of England and was ordained as a deacon at Rochester Cathedral. He was appointed a curate at Shooter's Hill in Kent in 1901, before travelling to South Africa in 1902 where he was an acting chaplain in the final months of the Second Boer War. He spent the next decade in South Africa, where he held the posts of vicar at Cleveland, Transvaal from 1903 to 1910, and reverend in the Johannesburg suburb of Belgravia from 1910 to 1914. During a visit to England in 1907, McCormick made an appearance in first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Leicestershire at Lord's. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed for 17 runs in the MCC first innings by John King, while in their second innings he was dismissed without scoring by William Odell. His sporting talents further presented themselves in South Africa, where he played rugby union for Transvaal in the Currie Cup, where opponents would attempt to get the better of McCormick by swearing and cursing around him in an attempt to offend his pious nature. His abilities as a rugby player were as such that he was selected in the squad for the 1906\u201307 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe, but did not travel with the team after it was discovered he did not meet the residence qualifications for selection."]}]}}
