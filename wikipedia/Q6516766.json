(1967\u2013present)", "response": ["Although the improved end to the season had given fresh hope that the impetus of the late 1990s could be revived, such plans were dashed when the club took 14 matches to record its first league win of the 2000\u201301 season beating Bradford City 1\u20130. Whilst several players, such as Malcolm Christie, bought from Nuneaton Borough for \u00a350,000 and eventually registering 30 goals in 129 appearances for the club over 5 years, Richard Jackson and Paul Boertien (both of whom spent nearly a decade at the club), were successfully captured from lower league sides, Smith's previous golden touch in the transfer market had appeared to desert him, as players such as Bjorn Otto Bragstad, Con Blatsis, and Daniele Daino where bought and barely registered on the field, with safety only guaranteed on the penultimate day of the 2000\u201301 FA Premier League season; Malcolm Christie's goal the difference in a 1\u20130 win away to Manchester United. Despite the headline grabbing capture of Italian international Fabrizio Ravanelli from Lazio, who scored on his debut in a 2\u20131 win over Blackburn Rovers, Derby's first opening day win since beating Sunderland 5\u20130 at the start of the 1993\u201394 season, Derby only took five points from their opening seven games of the 2000\u201301 season and Smith left his position in early October 2001, rejecting the position of Director of Football. He was replaced by Colin Todd, who had been his assistant since November 2000. Todd's tenure was a disaster as he recorded the shortest ever reign of a Derby manager, lasting just 98 days before he was sacked. After selling Seth Johnson to Leeds United for a club record \u00a37m, Todd used the windfall to bring in Fran\u00e7ois Grenet for \u00a33m (who left after just 14 games to join Rennes for just \u00a3800,000), Luciano Zavagno and Pierre Ducrocq but results did not improve and he was removed from his position after an embarrassing 3\u20131 capitulation at home to Division Three Bristol Rovers in the FA Cup Third Round. Todd won just four of his fifteen league games in charge and recorded heavy defeat by Fulham (2\u20135), Manchester United (0\u20135), Middlesbrough (1\u20135) and West Ham United (0\u20134) but, as Gerald Mortimer stated, \"Derby could not have it both ways. Either they were wrong to appoint (Todd) or wrong to dismiss him... Pickering's Chairmanship was pointing the club towards disaster.\" Another former Rams hero. John Gregory, was Todd's replacement, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract and becoming Derby's third manager of an increasingly troubled campaign, and initial seemed to have the force of personality to keep the Rams up. At one stage touted as a future England manager, Gregory had been in place at Aston Villa but his relationship with Villa chairman Doug Ellis led him to walk out to take charge at Derby. Gregory immediately bought in Newcastle pair Warren Barton and Rob Lee, and recorded three wins and a creditable 2\u20132 draw with Manchester United in his first seven games. The third of these wins, 3\u20131 away to Bolton Wanderers looked like pointing towards survival, but it proved to be Derby's last win of the season as they proceeded to lose their next seven games on the trot, the sixth of which, 0\u20132 at Liverpool, confirmed relegation after a 6-year stay in the top flight. The season ended with a 1\u20131 draw at Sunderland which took the club to 30 points, their lowest return for 11 years, and 19th place."]}, {"page": "List of people from Northumberland", "response": ["* Paul Boertien (born 1979), played for Derby County"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Burton Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| Paul Boertien"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Burton Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| Paul Boertien", "|align=\"left\"|2||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Paul Boertien", "| Paul Boertien"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|Paul Boertien", "|align=\"left\"|23||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Paul Boertien"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 in English football", "response": ["*15 December 2011: Paul Boertien, 32, former Carlisle United, Derby County, Walsall and Burton Albion defender."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Burton Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| Paul Boertien", "| 15 December 2011 || DF ||  Paul Boertien || Retired || \u2013 || "]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Crewe Alexandra F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Paul Boertien"]}, {"page": "Haydon Bridge High School", "response": ["*Paul Boertien, former footballer"]}, {"page": "Boertien, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Boertien"]}]}}
