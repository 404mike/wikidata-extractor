However, the owner, Sir Edward Page-Turner did not like the house, preferring to let it to a wealthy tenant before selling the estate to Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford in 1885. The Duke, who already owned two country houses in the county, was interested in the land rather than the building, so he ordered the partial demolition of the house in 1886. Only the ground floor was retained, which was used as a nursing home during the First World War and a maternity home in the Second World War. This was demolished after the war leaving just the Garden House, which is today a private dwelling. Two identical lodges built in a style to match the house, one on the A5 Watling Street and the other on A4012 (now, in 2019, the B5704) near Milton Bryan provided access to the estate, and remain in existence although in private ownership."]}, {"page": "9th Duke of Bedford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford"]}, {"page": "List of eponymous roads in London", "response": ["| Married to Lady Ermyntrude Sackville Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford, who owned much of the surrounding area"]}, {"page": "Francis Russell", "response": ["*Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford (1819\u20131891), English politician and agriculturalist"]}, {"page": "Charles Hastings Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford"]}, {"page": "Edward Malet", "response": ["On 19 March 1885, Edward Malet married Lady Ermyntrude Sackville Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford and Lady Elizabeth Sackville-West."]}]}}
