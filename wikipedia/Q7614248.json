He is best known for the goal he scored to secure a 2\u20131 victory for Wrexham over Arsenal in a FA Cup third round tie in 1992. At the time Arsenal were the reigning Division One champions, whilst Wrexham were a Division Four side. He later signed for Swansea City for \u00a3108,000, before finishing his career in the Welsh Premier League.

With the club knocked out of the League Cup and struggling in the league, it was left to the FA Cup to keep the season alive. Having beaten Telford United and Winsford United they were drawn to play the previous season's First Division champions and Arsenal. Wrexham produced one of their most memorable nights to beat the Gunners 2\u20131 after being behind, with a thunderous Mickey Thomas free kick and a Steve Watkin goal. They lost in the next round to West Ham United 1\u20130 in a replay after the first game had finished 2\u20132.", "*1991\u20131992  Steve Watkin 13 (19)"]}, {"page": "Watkin", "response": ["*Steve Watkin, English cricketer", "*Steve Watkin (footballer), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["Arsenal entered the FA Cup in the third round (last 64), in which they were drawn to face Wrexham of the Football League Fourth Division away from home.

His next appearance for the club came in bizarre circumstances as Colchester became the first club to have two goalkeepers sent off in the same fixture. The game against Hereford United on 16 October 1993 saw John Keeley sent off in the 43rd minute, the U's already 1\u20130 down from a Chris Pike goal. Roy McDonough covered in goal until half time, where he conceded another goal to Pike. Munson was brought on at half time but was sent off in the 68th minute after conceding to Chris Fry and Pike once again, giving him a hat-trick, scoring against three different goalkeepers in the same game.

They took the lead minutes before half-time when Alan Smith scored from a Paul Merson cross. Wrexham's performance improved the longer the match went, and they equalised through Mickey Thomas's free kick in the 82nd minute. Two minutes later, the home side went ahead after Steve Watkin collected the ball from his teammate Gordon Davies and diverted it past goalkeeper David Seaman. A pitch invasion occurred once the whistle blew for full-time; the Wrexham players and staff joined in celebrations with their supporters.

Taken by Paul Merson, the ball was flicked on at the near post by O'Leary and reached Alan Smith. The forward's header was obstructed by a Wrexham player, who proceeded to clear it out. It did not take long for Arsenal to create another chance; Nigel Winterburn played the ball down the left side of the pitch, finding Merson who ran in towards the penalty area and produced a cross. The ball was cleared, but reached Carter whose effort near the penalty spot went wide of the right-side post. Wrexham managed to get into the opposition's area and create half-chances, but then Arsenal broke forward again with Kevin Campbell having a shot on target. Gareth Owen nearly scored the opener, when he controlled the ball from a flick on and instinctively took a shot that whistled past the post. Two minutes before the interval, Arsenal took the lead. Merson surged forward into the penalty area and his cross was met Smith who slid the ball past goalkeeper Vince O'Keefe. Wrexham almost equalised immediately from the restart, but David Seaman denied Steve Watkin by rushing towards the midfielder and obstructing him.", "|FW ||10|| Steve Watkin"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Swansea City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|10||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Steve Watkin"]}, {"page": "1995 Welsh Cup Final", "response": ["|CF||14|| Steve Watkin || || "]}]}}
