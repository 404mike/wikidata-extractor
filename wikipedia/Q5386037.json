After learning more about the technical aspects of singing and having written some soul songs such as \"Love Goes Down\", which was written whilst supporting The Roots on tour in 2006, Plan B came up with the concept of a story about a soul singer who gets sent to prison. He commenced recording of the album in which half the songs were hip hop tracks narrated by Plan B and the other half were soul songs told through the eyes of the fictional character Strickland Banks. However, this idea was scrapped because the two genres did not work well together and the label 679 Artists thought the idea was too confusing. Hence the album was split into two records and it was agreed that the soul record would be released as Plan B's second studio album. The sound of the album was influenced by Paul Epworth who produced the demo version of \"Writing's on the Wall\", although the majority of the album was recorded with producers David McEwan and Eric Appapoulay at The Sanctuary, London.
