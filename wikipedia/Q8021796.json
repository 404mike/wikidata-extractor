Idris Hopkins briefly managed Portadown in 1952 before returning to England having failed to settle, resulting in Sloan being appointed manager for a fourth time in his place on a part-time basis. He remained in charge until January 1953, when Willie Ross was appointed on a permanent basis with Sloan reverting to his role as trainer. By the time he retired from football, Sloan had spent 30 years at Portadown in various capacities."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Willie Ross||||1950||4||2||"]}]}}
