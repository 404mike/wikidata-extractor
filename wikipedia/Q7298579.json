The match was against England at their national stadium, Twickenham. Wales had failed to win at the ground in their first nine attempts, and the Welsh failure at the ground was known as the 'Twickenham bogey'. Isaac was placed at open-side flanker, opposite the veteran Tom Arthur who was positioned on the blind side.Smith (1980), pg 274. In an exciting match Isaac, along with Turnbull, and Arthur, continually spoiled the English scrum.Smith (1980), pg 276. When Isaac caused the English half-backs to loose the loose maul, Watcyn Thomas heeled the ball back for Wooller, and then Davey to feed Ronnie Boon who scored a Welsh try.Smith (1980), pg 277. The game ended 7\u20133, with all the Welsh points scored by Boon, who had also placed a drop goal. Isaacs played just one more international game in the very next match of the Home Nations Championship against Scotland at St. Helens, his international career identical to that of Raymond Bark-Jones."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 1995", "response": ["*Raymond Bark-Jones, 83, English rugby union lock."]}]}}
