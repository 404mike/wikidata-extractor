Wade was serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II; stationed at RAF Credenhill in Herefordshire, he guested a few times for Southern League side Hereford United during this period as well.\nWade was a reserve full back and only played in a handful of matches during the 1940s; he made his debut in an FA Cup match against West Ham United on 5 January 1946; a mainly reserve Arsenal side were thrashed 6\u20130, which remains to this day Arsenal's worst FA Cup defeat in modern times. Wade continued to be a bit-part player; he made his league debut in a 4\u20132 win over Leeds United on 16 November 1946, but in all he only made sixteen appearances between 1946 and 1952; the likes of Walley Barnes and Laurie Scott keeping him out of the side. Arsenal won the old First Division in 1947-48 but he only made three league appearances all season.Barnes had badly injured his knee in the 1952 FA Cup Final, and Wade duly filled in for him for the whole of the 1952-53 season. Wade was a near ever-present and played 44 times as Arsenal won their seventh league title, pipping Preston North End on goal average; it would turn out to be their last trophy until 1970. However, the following season, 1953-54, Wade himself injured his knee in a floodlit friendly against Queens Park Rangers and after recovering, he struggled to take his place back off Len Wills and a now-recovered Barnes. He continued to flit in and out of the first team but spent all of the 1955-56 season in the reserve side, at the same time carrying out a role as coach of the Arsenal youth team.\nIn spring 1956 he left Arsenal to return to non-league Hereford United as player-manager. He played 91 first-team matches for Arsenal in total, never scoring a goal. At Hereford, he started the club's long-running tradition for knocking League sides out of the FA Cup, including Aldershot in 1956-57 and Queens Park Rangers in 1957-58. Wade won the \"Double\" of Southern League Cup and Southern League North-West Division in 1958-59, before leaving in 1962 to concentrate on his sports shop business.\nWade briefly returned as Hereford's caretaker manager after John Charles had quit in 1971, but apart from that he did not return to football management. He died in 2005, at the age of 84.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 7 July \u2013 Joe Wade, English footballer and manager (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "Joe Mercer", "response": ["Mercer went on to win an FA Cup winner's medal in 1950 and was voted FWA Footballer of the Year the same year.

He re-joined Stoke on his demob but was unable to break into the first team and he returned to Wales joining Barry Town. His performances at Jenner Park caught the eye of several Football League clubs and in July 1958 he signed for Northampton Town, and although he was unable to force his way into the side on a regular basis featured 8 times for the Cobblers in the 1959\u201360 season.
