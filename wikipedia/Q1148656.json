According to Cyril Mango, the mosaic is \"a curious reflection on how little we know about Byzantine art\". The work is generally believed to date from after the end of Byzantine Iconoclasm and usually dated to the patriarchate of Photius I () and the time of the emperors Michael III () and Basil I (). Most specifically, the mosaic has been connected with a surviving homily known to have been written and delivered by Photius in the cathedral on 29 March 867."]}, {"page": "Basilica", "response": ["At Chalcedon, opposite Constantinople on the Bosporus, the relics of Euphemia \u2013 a supposed Christian martyr of the Diocletianic Persecution \u2013 were housed in a martyrium accompanied by a basilica. The basilica already existed when Egeria passed through Chalcedon in 384, and in 436 Melania the Younger visited the church on her own journey to the Holy Land. From the description of Evagrius Scholasticus the church is identifiable as an aisled basilica attached to the martyrium and preceded by an atrium.Evagrius Scholasticus, Ecclesiastical History, II.3: \"The precinct consists of three huge structures: one is open-air, adorned with a long court and columns on all sides, and another in turn after this is almost alike in breadth and length and columns but differing only in the roof above.\"  The Council of Chalcedon (8\u201331 October 451) was held in the basilica, which must have been large enough to accommodate the more than two hundred bishops that attneded its third session, together with their translators and servants; around 350 bishops attended the Council in all. In an ekphrasis in his eleventh sermon, Asterius of Amasea described an icon in the church depicting Euphemia's martyrdom. The church was restored under the patronage of the patricia and daughter of Olybrius, Anicia Juliana. Pope Vigilius fled there from Constantinople during the Three-Chapter Controversy.  The basilica, which lay outside the walls of Chalcedon, was destroyed by the Persians in the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628 during one of the Sasanian occupations of the city in 615 and 626. The relics of Euphemia were reportedly translated to a new Church of St Euphemia in Constantinople in 680, though Cyril Mango argued the translation never took place. Subsequently, Asterius's sermon On the Martyrdom of St Euphemia was advanced as an argument for iconodulism at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787."]}, {"page": "Maurice (emperor)", "response": ["The first legendary accounts of Maurice's life are recorded in the ninth century, in the work of the Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor. According to his chronicle Chronographia, the death of the imperial family is due to divine intervention: Christ asked the Emperor to choose between a long reign or death and acceptance in the kingdom of heaven. Maurice preferred the second choice.Theophanes (1997) [815]. Chronicle, translated by Cyril Mango & Roger Scott.

Emperor Anastasios II began making preparations to defend against this new onslaught. This including sending the patrician and urban prefect, Daniel of Sinope, to spy on the Arabs, under the pretense of a diplomatic embassy, as well as shoring up the defences of Constantinople, and strengthening the Byzantine Navy. Theophanes states that in early 715 Anastasios II had commanded the navy to gather at Rhodes to then advance to Phoenix. It was there that the troops of the Opsician Theme mutinied against their commander, John the Deacon, killing him before sailing for Adramyttium, and there declared Theodosius, a tax collector, as Emperor Theodosius III. The historian J. B. Bury suggests that he was selected at random for little more than the fact that he already had an imperial name, was inoffensive, obscure but respectable, and could easily be controlled by the Opsicians. Graham Sumner, the Byzantine historian, suggests that Theodosius might be the same person as Theodosius, the son of Emperor Tiberius III, therefore explaining why he might have been chosen by the troops, as he would have legitimacy from his father, himself made emperor by a naval revolt. Theodosius, the son of Tiberius, was bishop of Ephesus by 729, and held this position until his death, sometime around 24 July 754, and was a leading figure of the iconoclastic Council of Hieria in 754. Byzantine historians Cyril Mango and Roger Scott do not view this theory as likely, as it would mean that Theodosius lived for thirty more years after his abdication."]}, {"page": "El Greco", "response": ["The discovery of the Dormition of the Virgin on Syros, an authentic and signed work from the painter's Cretan period, and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories. Although following many conventions of the Byzantine icon, aspects of the style certainly show Venetian influence, and the composition, showing the death of Mary, combines the different doctrines of the Orthodox Dormition of the Virgin and the Catholic Assumption of the Virgin.Robin Cormack (1997), 199 Significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work, including his supposed Byzantinism. Based on the notes written in El Greco's own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art.R.M. Helm, The Neoplatonic Tradition in the Art of El Greco, 93\u201394* A.L.

Lambraki-Plaka, El Greco, the Puzzle, 19 In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka disagrees with Oxford University professors Cyril Mango and Elizabeth Jeffreys, who assert that \"despite claims to the contrary, the only Byzantine element of his famous paintings was his signature in Greek lettering\".Mango-Jeffreys, Towards a FrancoGreek Culture, 305 Nikos Hadjinikolaou states that from 1570 El Greco's painting is \"neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine but Western European.

The name Helena appears in all areas of the Empire. Joseph Vogt suggested that the name Helena was typical for the Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire and that therefore her place of origin should be looked for in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. The 6th-century historian Procopius is the earliest authority for the statement that Helena was a native of Drepanum, in the province of Bithynia in Asia Minor. However, the name Helena wasn't epigraphically attested in inscriptions of Bithynia (Helena's proposed region of origin) and it was also common in Latin-speaking areas. Procopius lived much later than the era he was describing and his description may have been actually intended as an etymological explanation about the toponym Helenopolis. On the other hand, her son Constantine renamed the city \"Helenopolis\" after her death around 330 AD, which supports the belief that the city was indeed her birthplace.Harbus, 12. The Byzantinist Cyril Mango has, however, argued that Helenopolis was refounded to strengthen the communication network around Constantine's new capital in Constantinople, and was renamed simply to honor Helena, not to necessarily mark her birthplace.Mango, 143\u201358, cited in Harbus, 13. There was also a Helenopolis in PalestineG\u00fcnter Stemberger, Jews and Christians in the Holy Land: Palestine in the fourth century, 2000, p. 9 (full text). and a Helenopolis in Lydia.Hunt, 49, cited in Harbus, 12. These cities, and the province of Helenopontus in the Pontus, were probably all named after Constantine's mother. Two other locations in France and the Pyrenees have been named after Helena. Equally uncertain to Drepanum and without strong documentation suggestions about her birthplace are: Naissus (central Balkans), Caphar or Edessa (Messopotamia), Trier."]}, {"page": "Tiberius III", "response": ["Tiberius had a son, Theodosius, who became bishop of Ephesus by 729, and presided over the Council of Hieria in 754, and was a confidant of Emperors Leo III () and Constantine V ().

Sumner presents the evidence that both figures held the Bishopric of Ephesus at similar times: Emperor Theodosius became bishop after 716, according to the Chronicon Altinate et Gradense, and Theodosius the son of Tiberius became bishop by 729, suggesting they may be the same person.

Cyril Mango identifies it with the Old Golden Gate; van Millingen places it on the Seventh Hill, at a height probably corresponding to one of the later gates of the Theodosian Wall in that area; and Raymond Janin places it further north, across the Lycus and near the point where the river passed under the wall. In earlier centuries, it was decorated with many statues, including one of Constantine, which fell down in an earthquake in 740.", "The seaward walls (, teich\u0113 paralia) enclosed the city on the sides of the Sea of Marmara (Propontis) and the gulf of the Golden Horn (). Although the original city of Byzantium certainly had sea walls, traces of which survive, the exact date for the construction of the medieval walls is a matter of debate. Traditionally, the seaward walls have been attributed by scholars to Constantine I, along with the construction of the main land wall. The first known reference to their construction comes in 439, when the urban prefect Cyrus of Panopolis (in sources often confused with the praetorian prefect Constantine) was ordered to repair the city walls and complete them on the seaward side., note 21;  This activity is certainly not unconnected to the fact that in the same year, Carthage fell to the Vandals, an event which signaled the emergence of a naval threat in the Mediterranean. This two-phase construction remains the general consensus, but Cyril Mango doubts the existence of any seaward fortifications during Late Antiquity, as they are not specifically mentioned as extant by contemporary sources until much later, around the year 700., note 7; "]}, {"page": "Byzantine art", "response": ["In any case, the debate is purely modern: it is clear that most Byzantine viewers did not consider their art to be abstract or unnaturalistic.
