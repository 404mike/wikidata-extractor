Major General Wade Hampton was to march north from Lake Champlain and join a force under General James Wilkinson that would sail from Sackett's Harbor on Lake Ontario and descend the St. Lawrence. Hampton was delayed by road and supply problems and his intense dislike of Wilkinson limited his desire to support his plan.Daughan, George C. 1812 (p. 220). Basic Books. Kindle Edition Charles de Salaberry defeated Hampton's force of 4,000 at the Chateauguay River on 25 October with a smaller force of Canadian Voltigeurs and Mohawks. Salaberry's force numbered only 339, but it had a strong defensive position. Wilkinson's force of 8,000 set out on 17 October, but it was delayed by weather. Wilkinson heard that a British force was pursuing him under Captain William Mulcaster and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Wanton Morrison and landed near Morrisburg, Ontario by 10 November, about 150 kilometres (90\u00a0mi) from Montreal. On 11 November, his rear guard of 2,500 attacked Morrison's force of 800 at Crysler's Farm and was repulsed with heavy losses. He learned that Hampton could not renew his advance, retreated to the United States and settled into winter quarters. He resigned his command after a failed attack on a British outpost at Lacolle Mills."]}, {"page": "List of guerrillas", "response": ["**William Mulcaster"]}, {"page": "Battle of Crysler's Farm", "response": ["On 1 November, the first boats set out from the island, and reached French Creek (near present-day Clayton, New York) on 4 November. Here, the first shots of the campaign were fired. British brigs and gunboats under Commander William Mulcaster had left Kingston to rendezvous with and escort batteaux and canoes carrying supplies up the Saint Lawrence. The aggressive Mulcaster bombarded the American anchorages and encampments during the evening. The next morning, American artillerymen under Lieutenant Colonel Moses Porter drove him away, using hastily heated \"hot shot\".

The brig was later salvaged and returned to service.)"]}, {"page": "Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| 1563 (Jan)|| Richard Assheton|| William Mulcaster"]}, {"page": "John Montresor", "response": [" Montresor's romantic life has been the subject of much writing.

After war with America broke out, the Commander in Chief on the North American station (Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, 1st Baronet), detached Barclay and two other lieutenants (Robert Finnis and Daniel Pring) to act as \"Captains of Corvettes\" on the Great Lakes.J. Mackay Hitsman, The Incredible War of 1812, p.119 Barclay arrived at Kingston on Lake Ontario on 5 May 1813, and took charge of the squadron there with the acting rank of Commander. Ten days later he was superseded by Captain James Lucas Yeo. Yeo first offered the command of the detached squadron on Lake Erie to his friend, William Mulcaster. Mulcaster declined, probably because of the undermanned and underequipped state of the force, and the post was offered to Barclay, who quickly accepted."]}, {"page": "Joseph Wanton Morrison", "response": ["In October 1813, the 2/89th were stationed at Kingston in Upper Canada when news arrived that a large American force was descending the Saint Lawrence River, intent on attacking Montreal. Morrison was placed in command of a Corps of Observation which included his own battalion, and was ordered to pursue and harass this American army. His force, numbering 900 and supported by gunboats under Captain William Mulcaster, was encamped at Crysler's Farm on 11 November. Major General James Wilkinson, commanding the American army, determined to drive Morrison's force away before proceeding further down the river. On favourable ground and using the classic British tactics of fighting in line and firing deliberate controlled volleys, Morrison's troops easily repulsed the American attack, even though outnumbered three to one, and captured a 6-pounder gun which the Americans abandoned as they retreated."]}, {"page": "Engagements on Lake Ontario", "response": ["At about 12:40 pm, Yeo abruptly reversed course, intending to exchange a single broadside with General Pike while they passed on opposite tacks, and then concentrate against the weaker schooners at the rear of Chauncey's line. However, Chauncey also reversed course and General Pike and Yeo's flagship, Wolfe, exchanged several broadsides on the same tack. The American fire brought down Wolfes mizzen- and main-topmasts. Yeo's second in command, Commander William Mulcaster, interposed his ship, Royal George, between Wolfe and General Pike and backed his sails while the crew of Wolfe cleared away the wreckage and headed downwind towards Burlington Bay at the western end of the lake."]}, {"page": "William Howe Mulcaster", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Mulcaster"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["|Major-General Frederick William Mulcaster"]}, {"page": "Mulcaster, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Mulcaster"]}, {"page": "HMS Minerva (1805)", "response": ["From February 1806 Minerva served under Captain George Collier in the English Channel.Winfield, British Warships, p. 497.
