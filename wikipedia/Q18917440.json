He married into money, as his father had done, and thereafter spent his life trying to dispose of his fortune to the benefit of religious, educational and medical causes in England and abroad. A zealot, long widowed and childless, his domestic life was frugal and he left nothing to his family.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leamington Spa", "response": ["In 1832 the town's main hospital, Warneford Hospital, opened, named after philanthropist Samuel Wilson Warneford. At first a semi-private affair it was taken over by the National Health Service after the Second World War, before succumbing to budget cuts and closing in 1993."]}, {"page": "Moreton-in-Marsh", "response": ["The Church of England parish church of Saint David began as a chapel of ease for Blockley, to which the residents of Moreton had to transport their dead for burial.Elrington, 1965, pages 240\u2013250 The early history of the church in Moreton is not clear, but there is evidence that a primitive Celtic place of worship preceded the church on the present site, which had seven springs. The church at Moreton came under the jurisdiction of the Batsford Estate, when that estate was given to the Bishops of Worcester in the 12th century. Latterly, the church in Moreton was a chapel-at-ease for Batsford, which was technically the parish church. The appointment of the vicar for Batsford with Moreton alternates between the Bishop of Gloucester and the Lord of the Manor at Batsford, currently Lord Dulverton, who, until the Second World War, exercised his right to collect a shilling (5 pence) a year for every shop window facing Moreton High Street. There is a tradition that the church was rebuilt and reconsecrated in the middle of the 16th century. The nave was enlarged in 1790, with a \u00a31,000 gift from Samuel Wilson Warneford, most of the church was rebuilt in 1858 and the tower was replaced in 1860. The chancel and south aisle were enlarged in 1892 and the east end of the south aisle has been used as a chapel since 1927."]}, {"page": "John Owens (merchant)", "response": ["Unlike his garrulous father, Owens was a quiet, book-ish person. He was often ill, never married, did not mix much with other business people in Manchester, and had few friends other than George Faulkner. He was a Liberal in politics and a Congregationalist by religion, although in his later life he stopped worshipping in chapel and instead attended the nearby Anglican St Saviour's Church. Whyte says that both Samuel Wilson Warneford, \"a grasping, avaricious, bigoted reactionary\" whose riches did much to develop higher education at Queen's College, Birmingham, and Owens - \"a parsimonious, work-obsessed, easily offended bachelor, who gave little to charity in his lifetime\" - were \"disagreeable men, with deep pockets and few friends\"."]}, {"page": "St Edmund's School Canterbury", "response": ["In 1855, the school moved to Canterbury. The acquisition of property and financing to build the school was provided by Samuel Wilson Warneford.

The historian William Whyte says that Warneford - in life \"a grasping, avaricious, bigoted reactionary\" - and John Owens - \"a parsimonious, work-obsessed, easily offended bachelor, who gave little to charity in his lifetime\" and whose legacy was the basis for Owens College in Manchester - were \"disagreeable men, with deep pockets and few friends\". The two institutions were very different but in the characters of their benefactors lie fundamental similarities often found in history, that philanthropy is not necessarily selfless and that \"the good are not always very nice\". Warneford ensured that Queen's was an exclusively Anglican institution and as much as seminary as a medical school."]}, {"page": "Clergy Support Trust", "response": ["In 1852 Dr Samuel Wilson Warneford, purchased a site for a new school in Canterbury and provided funds for the construction of a school and for scholarships.
