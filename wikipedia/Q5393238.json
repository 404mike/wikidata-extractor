In 1951, he founded Souvenir Press Ltd, one of the very few remaining independently owned major publishing houses in Great Britain. In 2003 he set up the Ernest Hecht Charitable Foundation. Described by The Bookseller as \"one of a number of \u00e9migr\u00e9s who changed the face of British publishing after the Second World War alongside George Weidenfeld, Paul Hamlyn and Andr\u00e9 Deutsch\", Hecht has been called \"the last of the great publishers\". He was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to Publishing and Charity in June 2015. In August 2015, he was honoured by the President of Brazil with the Order of Rio Branco, which was presented to Hecht at a ceremony by the Brazilian Ambassador in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter O'Donnell", "response": ["At the request of publisher Ernest Hecht, he began writing gothic romance and adventure novels under the pen name of Madeleine Brent.  The novels are not a series, but feature a variety of strong female protagonists.  They are written in first person, take place in the late Victorian era, and although every protagonist has connections to England, part of each book is set in various locations around the world\u2014including China, Australia, Afghanistan, and Mexico. In 2001, O'Donnell retired from writing the Modesty Blaise comic strip (the lead characters having been given a definitive end in the previous Cobra Trap short story collection) and was also said to have retired from full-time writing (in 2002, he gave Romero permission to adapt one of his short stories, \"The Dark Angels\", to a comic initially published in Scandinavian anthology magazine Agent X9 and later reprinted by Comics Revue magazine in the US). From 2004 to 2009 he wrote the introductions for a series of Modesty Blaise comic strip reprint volumes published by Titan Books; beginning in 2010, just prior to O'Donnell's death, another writer had begun composing these introductions. He was also interviewed for a special feature included on the DVD release of the 2004 film My Name Is Modesty, which was based on his creation."]}, {"page": "British Book Awards", "response": ["* 2001 \u2013 Ernest Hecht"]}, {"page": "The Curse of the Daleks", "response": ["The Curse Of The Daleks is a Dalek stage play, written by David Whitaker and Terry Nation, which appeared for one month at the Wyndham's Theatre in London beginning 21 December 1965.
