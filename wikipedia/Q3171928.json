The series evolved, as a result, from a series of relatively unconnected one-off episodes to an overarching 'soap opera' complete with office romances. There has been controversy over Ed's surname - because he was never called anything other than \"Ed\", some people have taken his surname to be Russell, simply because he was addressed as \"Dr Russell\" in one episode.
