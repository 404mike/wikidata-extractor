He would go out alone in his vehicle to rescue Tutsis and bring them to safety before they could be hunted down and killed. He also recovered some Hutus. Because he had to pass through dozens of checkpoints manned by Interahamwe tasked with killing Tutsis and moderate Hutus, Diagne ferried at most five people on each trip, often taking them to the H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines or Amahoro Stadium, both under UN guard, for safety. In order to get past the checkpoints, he relied on his extensive contacts among the military and militias, his ability to defuse tense situations with quick jokes, and occasional bribes of cigarettes, money and\u2014though he was a devout Muslim\u2014alcohol.\"Memories of Captain Mbaye Diagne\": Mark Doyle, \"Ghosts of Rwanda\" program, Frontline, posted 1 April 2004 He paid off militiamen to facilitate the escape of Rwandan employees of UN aid projects.

In one instance Doyle was riding in Diagne's car when the two were stopped by a Hutu militia. The militiamen questioned whether Doyle was Belgian, since they were suspicious of Belgians.
