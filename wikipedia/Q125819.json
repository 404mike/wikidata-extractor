He became professor of heavy electrical engineering at Imperial College in 1964, where he continued his successful development of the linear motor. Since linear motors do not require physical contact between the vehicle and guideway, they became a common fixture on advanced transportation systems in the 1960s and '70s. Laithwaite joined one such project, the Tracked Hovercraft, although the project was cancelled in 1973.\"Obituary for the late Professor Eric Laithwaite\" , Daily Telegraph, 6 December 1997.", "The major advantage to suspended maglev systems is that they work at all speeds, unlike electrodynamic systems, which only work at a minimum speed of about . This eliminates the need for a separate low-speed suspension system, and can simplify track layout. On the downside, the dynamic instability demands fine track tolerances, which can offset this advantage. Eric Laithwaite was concerned that to meet required tolerances, the gap between magnets and rail would have to be increased to the point where the magnets would be unreasonably large. In practice, this problem was addressed through improved feedback systems, which support the required tolerances."]}, {"page": "Dean drive", "response": ["* Eric Laithwaite, a UK inventor who made similar claims."]}, {"page": "Sutton-in-the-Isle", "response": ["During the 1960s, the Sutton Gault hamlet was the site of one of the world's first tracked hovercraft, designed by Eric Laithwaite.

Linear motors were a major area of research since the 1960s when they were first introduced in the U.K. by Eric Laithwaite.Brian Bowers, \"Obituary: Professor Eric Laithwaite\", The Independent, 13 December 1997 As they have no moving parts, a LIM-powered vehicle would be more reliable than one using a conventional motor. Another advantage is that there is no contact between the motor and the track, so snow or rain will not affect its performance, which means a LIM vehicle does not require additional headspace in bad weather. Also, because the traction does not rely on friction, LIMs can climb much steeper grades.Shintaro Teraoka, \"Adoption of Linear Motor Propulsion System for Subway\" , Osaka Municipal Transportation Bureau, 1998 On the downside, LIMs require a \"reaction rail\" for the motor to push against, which increases capital costs slightly."]}, {"page": "Royal Institution Christmas Lectures", "response": ["The Royal Institution's Christmas Lectures were first held in 1825, and have continued on an annual basis since then except during the Second World War.
