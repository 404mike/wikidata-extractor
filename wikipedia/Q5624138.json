T. Meade", "response": ["She began writing at 17 and produced over 300 books in her lifetime, being so prolific that no fewer than eleven new titles under her byline appeared in the first few years after her death.  She was primarily known for her books for young people, of which the most famous was A World of Girls, published in 1886.  However, she also wrote \"sentimental\" and \"sensational\" stories, religious stories, historical novels, adventure, romances, and mysteries, including several with male co-authors.  The first of these was Dr. Clifford Halifax, with whom she first collaborated in 1893 and wrote six books.  A year later she first teamed with Robert Eustace, and turned out eleven volumes with him.  Her last co-author was Sir Robert Kennaway Douglas (her daughter's father-in-law); they produced only one book, in 1897.  The Eustace partnerships are notable for two female villains, Madame Sara (in The Sorceress of the Strand) and Madame Koluchy (the mastermind of a band of gangsters, in The Brotherhood of the Seven Kings).  Meade and Eustace also created the occult detective and palmist Diana Marburg (\"the Oracle of Maddox Street\"), who first appeared in the US edition of Pearson's Magazine in 1902. One of her most unusual titles is Dumps; A Plain Girl (1905). She was also the editor of a popular girls' magazine, Atalanta."]}, {"page": "Story of the Nations series", "response": ["|Robert Kennaway Douglas"]}, {"page": "1903 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Robert Kennaway Douglas, Esq., British Museum"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Bachelor appointed in 1903", "response": ["|Robert Kennaway Douglas"]}]}}
