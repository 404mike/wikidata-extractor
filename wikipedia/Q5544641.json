He also played in armed services representative sides which were Great Britain elevens in all but name. According to George Allison, Arsenal's manager, wartime football was 'better in quality than pre-war League football'.\nAfter retiring from playing, Smith had a successful career as both an F.A. coach and manager. His league win ratios at Crystal Palace and Portsmouth FC were 43% and 36% respectively.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
