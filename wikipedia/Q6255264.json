A prop, he toured New Zealand and Australia with the British and Irish Lions in 1950 and became the first Lions coach, on the 1966 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand.\nRobins was born in Cardiff.  He was educated at Llandaff Cathedral School and Wellington School.  He joined the Royal Navy and served in World War II.  He played for England in two wartime Services Internationals.  He trained as a teacher at Loughborough and returned there as a lecturer before taking up the post of Director of Physical Education and Recreation at Sheffield University and subsequently the same position at University College, Cardiff.\nRobins played for Leicester Tigers and was a noted goal-kicker despite being a prop.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mike Campbell-Lamerton", "response": ["At one stage the manager, Des O'Brien left the party for a reconnaissance mission to Fiji (where a final tour game was to be played), and the coach, John Robins, was in hospital with damaged ankle ligaments, leaving Campbell-Lamerton with far greater responsibilities than any modern equivalent would face. Yet in a squad which he had not been expected to captain, his players still speak warmly of the example he set after a tour in which the Lions lost all four internationals against the All Blacks. The recurrence of an ankle injury which caused his withdrawal from the second game against New Zealand, did not help and he also missed the final international. \"Mike was a decent man and much-maligned\", Brian Price, his second-row partner in three of the tour internationals, said. \"We knew how hard he was working and it was because we respected his efforts, we stuck together.\" "]}, {"page": "Jack Kyle", "response": ["In 1950, Kyle also played for the British Lions on their tour to New Zealand and Australia. He played in 20 of the 29 games, including all six Tests. Among his tour highlights was a display that came in the first Test, a 9\u20139 draw with New Zealand. Of the Lions' nine points, Kyle scored a try, created another for Ken Jones and won a penalty that was converted by John Robins. During the tour, he also scored a try in the 24\u20133 defeat of Australia."]}, {"page": "1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia", "response": ["|John Robins ||Prop|||| Birkenhead Park|| 5"]}, {"page": "Cliff Davies (rugby union)", "response": ["1950 was a far better year for Davies, which cemented his position as one of the truly great Welsh props. Davies played in all four of the 1950 Championship which saw Wales win their first Grand Slam since 1911. The Welsh pack included two inexperienced players, David Davies and John Robins, and it was Cliff who steadied the Welsh pack, allowing his hooker to win key possession in the scrums. In the opening game against England, Davies also scored his only international points, finishing off a Lewis John run to score a try at Twickenham to give Wales the victory. That year he was chosen for the British Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, and although playing in only one test, he was a popular character who kept up team morale."]}]}}
