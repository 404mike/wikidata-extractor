He also made one senior appearance for Crystal Palace in the FA Cup. He later played Northern Premier League football with Morecambe, Skelmersdale United and South Liverpool. He won promotion out of the Fourth Division with Port Vale in 1969\u201370.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["In preparation for the 1969\u201370 campaign he released Mick Cullerton, Mick Mahon, Jimmy Goodfellow, Graham Williams, and Milija Aleksic; whilst top-scorer Roy Chapman rejected a new contract and signed with Chester City. Despite this, the club's dire finances meant that he was only able to bring in three new attackers on free transfers: Ken Wookey (Newport County); Stuart Shaw (Southport); and Eric Magee (Oldham Athletic). Vale started the season with a club-record unbeaten 18 matches, and Lee began playing midfielder Tommy McLaren on a regular basis. Vale's financial situation was highlighted by the fact that they could not afford the \u00a3500 registration fee for Ian Buxton following the player's departure from Notts County. The \"Valiants\" were knocked off the top of the table following a bout of injuries, and Lee was forced to sign wing-half Tony Lacey on loan from Stoke City, and also bought Bill Summerscales from Leek Town for \u00a3400. As promotion was secured with a nine-game unbeaten run, Lee signed Lacey permanently for \u00a32,500 and also brought Sammy Morgan in on a free transfer from Gorleston. Speaking of their third-place finish, Lee said that \"no team could have deserved reward as much for their hard work and strength of character\".", "Preparing for life in the Third Division, Lee released Ken Wookey, Stuart Shaw, Eric Magee, Stuart Chapman, and Gordon Logan. In their place he signed centre-half Roy Cross from Walsall, inside-forward Brian Horton from Hednesford Town, and full-back Mick Hopkinson from Mansfield Town. He steadied the ship in the midst of infighting in the boardroom, and the team went on a four-game winning streak in October that included a 2\u20130 win over fallen-giants Aston Villa. In January, he signed John Brodie from Northern Premier League side Bradford Park Avenue for \u00a3250, and noted that his team's performances were not helped by the 'boo boys' at Vale Park. Safety was assured with a 17th place, three points above relegated Reading."]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["In the pre-season there were talks of bringing speedway to Vale Park, introducing a new team to the British League Division Two. However many were opposed to the idea, and a 2,600 strong petition was given to local MP John Forrester. The idea was killed when the council failed to grant planning permission, despite a 3,000 strong petition in favour of the proposal. The club had hoped to profit from the venture, however many locals were concerned about noise pollution. Gordon Lee meanwhile had little in the way of funds when it came to signing new players, and so he was only able to bring in three new attackers on free transfers: Ken Wookey (Newport County); Stuart Shaw (Southport); and Eric Magee (Oldham Athletic).", "On the financial side, a loss of \u00a33,003 was made despite fund raising donations of \u00a317,925. Gate receipts were up by over \u00a313,000 as home attendances were encouraging, however expenditure had increased and there was a transfer deficit of \u00a32,900. Six players were let go at the season's end, including Ken Wookey (Workington); Stuart Shaw (Morecambe); Eric Magee (Linfield); Stuart Chapman (Stafford Rangers); and Gordon Logan (Kettering Town).", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Stuart Shaw", "| July 1969 || MF ||  || Stuart Shaw || Southport || Free transfer || ", "| May 1970 || MF ||  || Stuart Shaw || Morecambe || Free transfer || "]}]}}
