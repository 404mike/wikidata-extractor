In the uneasy silence following the cessation of Stalin's last agonies, Beria was the first to dart forward to kiss his lifeless form (a move likened by Montefiore to \"wrenching a dead King's ring off his finger\"). While the rest of Stalin's inner circle (even Molotov, saved from certain liquidation) stood sobbing unashamedly over the body, Beria reportedly appeared \"radiant\", \"regenerated\" and \"glistening with ill-concealed relish\". When Beria left the room, he broke the sombre atmosphere by shouting loudly for his driver, his voice echoing with what Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva called \"the ring of triumph unconcealed\". Alliluyeva noticed how the Politburo seemed openly frightened of Beria and unnerved by his bold display of ambition. \"He's off to take power,\" Mikoyan recalled muttering to Khrushchev. That prompted a \"frantic\" dash for their own limousines to intercept him at the Kremlin."]}, {"page": "March 6", "response": ["*1967 \u2013 Cold War: Joseph Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva defects to the United States."]}, {"page": "November 22", "response": ["*2011 \u2013 Svetlana Alliluyeva, Russian-American author and educator (b. 1926)"]}, {"page": "1926", "response": ["* February 28 \u2013 Svetlana Alliluyeva, Russian author (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "1967", "response": ["* March 9 \u2013 Joseph Stalin's daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, defects to the United States via the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi."]}, {"page": "2011", "response": ["** Svetlana Alliluyeva, daughter of Joseph Stalin (b. 1926)"]}, {"page": "Princeton, New Jersey", "response": ["* Svetlana Alliluyeva (1926\u20132011), daughter of Joseph Stalin, defected to United States and lived in PrincetonMartin, Douglas. \"Lana Peters, Stalin's Daughter, Dies at 85\", The New York Times, November 28, 2011.
