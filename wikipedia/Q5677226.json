He considers that the notes of the piece are not too difficult to play, but that an organist performing the work is primarily challenged by interpretation. He gives tips on how to perform the work so that it does not sound like a \"meaningless scramble\". He describes the fugue as slender and simple, but only a \"very sketchy example of the form\". In his description of the piece, Grace refers to Pirro, elaborating Pirro's \"storm\" analogy, and like Pirro, he seems convinced Bach went touring with the piece.

The pieces are on a large and often epic scale, compared with the miniature intimacy of the choral preludes of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein. Many of the chorale preludes pay homage to much older models in the German liturgical tradition (Georg B\u00f6hm, Buxtehude and Pachelbel), but the parallel influence of the Italian concerto tradition is equally visible. It is a mid-eighteenth century salute to the musical traditions of the previous century.

In 1916, the musicologist Harvey Grace described it in The Musical Times as showing Reger \"at his best\". In 1961 the American organist Allan Bacon commented on \"the enormous disparity between the various pieces from the standpoint of sheer technical difficulty,\" describing some as \"tenderly naive, flowly gently along\" while others were only playable by virtuoso organists like Karl Straube, who championed Reger's works during his lifetime. In his 1939 biography of Reger, Fritz Stein wrote of the chorale preludes in Op. 67 and Op. 79b, \"In spite of their contrapuntal art and link with the motivic work of the old organ chorales, they represent no advancement on the depth of religious expression found in Bach's models. Many are merely workmanlike, but if a chorale rests on Reger's innermost religious convictions\u2014such as 'Auf tiefer Not', 'Herzlich tut mich verlangen' and 'O Welt ich muss dich lassen'\u2014then these preludes express pious emotion.\"", "*Figural chorale prelude. These form the bulk of the collection, all but thirteen of the preludes having this form. Of the figurative chorales, three are ornamental chorale preludes, a genre described in further detail below. The figural chorale preludes have an accompaniment built up from one or more figure or motif either directly derived from the cantus firmus\u2014often by diminution\u2014or newly composed. The cantus firmus either plays continuously throughout a prelude or can be broken up by short passages of the accompanying motifs. In general the figural chorale preludes show a number of common features: individual pieces have a rhythmic uniformity; the motifs derived from the chorale mostly are limited to introductory bars; the accompaniment is rarely formed from just one motif or rhythmic element; and there is an overall preference for free counterpoint rather than imitation.  Harvey Grace criticized Reger's tendency to introduce promising motifs, sometimes heard in imitation between the parts, only to abandon them once the cantus firmus entered."]}]}}
