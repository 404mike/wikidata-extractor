He won a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games in 1970 in the heavyweight class of the weightlifting but was more prominent as a Highland Games competitor, in which capacity he won the inaugural World Highland Games Championships in 1980 in Los Angeles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Britain's Strongest Man", "response": ["In a history that has close parallels with that of the World's Strongest Man competition, the BSM competition has had a number of sponsors and, at different times, has had to vie with rival competitions that also claim to produce the strongest man in Britain as their champion. The inaugural competition was in 1979David Webster, Sons of Samson Volume 2 Profiles, page 78 (Ironmind Enterprises),  and was organised by TWI. It was covered by the BBC. The final contest involved the field athletes Geoff Capes and Jim Whitehead, weightlifter Andy Drzewiecki, powerlifter Ray Nobile, Highland Games specialists Bill Anderson and Grant Anderson, wrestler Big Pat Roach, and Tosher Killingback; it was won by Geoff Capes.BFI film and tv database The contestants were there by invitation. The format continued until 1984. There was then a break of three years, from 1985 through 1988, before the competition returned in 1989. In 1986, there was a \"Britain's Most Powerful Man\" and, in 1988, a competition was organised by Geoff Capes and David Webster to find a successor to Geoff Capes, called the John Smith's Trial of Strength. The results of these competitions are often deemed to be equivalent to Britain's Strongest Man given the lack of a competition in those years. The IFSA, after its creation in the mid-nineties, managed the event but parted company with TW1 after the completion of the 2004 event. TW1 have managed to have the event televised since the BBC opted out in 2004, with Sky One covering it in 2005 Tim Burrows was the youngest ever winner from Great Britain and Five in 2007 and 2008. The competition is currently sponsored by Met-Rx. As of 2017, Channel 5 currently broadcasts an episode devoted to the Britain's Strongest Man contest as part of its annual World's Strongest Man coverage in late December."]}, {"page": "World Highland Games Championships", "response": ["|1980 ||  Grant Anderson ||  Los Angeles, California, United States", "|1982 ||  Grant Anderson ||  Prestonpans, Scotland", "| Grant Anderson || 2"]}, {"page": "Grant Anderson", "response": ["Grant Anderson may refer to:", "* Grant Anderson (rugby union, born August 1989), Scotland 7s international rugby union player", "* Grant Anderson (footballer) (born 1986), Scottish footballer", "* Grant Anderson (Highland games), Scottish weightlifter and Highland Games competitor", "* Grant Anderson (rugby union, born September 1989), English rugby union player", "* Grant Anderson (rugby league) (born 1969), rugby league footballer of the 1980s and 1990s", "* Grant Anderson (minor league baseball host)", "* J.
