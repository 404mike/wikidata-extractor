No. 62 Squadron was one of the last two Bristol F.2 Fighter squadrons to serve at the Western Front, the other being No. 88 Squadron. The aircraft of both squadrons often escorted de Havilland planes on bombing missions. By the end of the war, No. 62 Squadron was credited with 76 enemy aircraft destroyed and 85 driven out of control.\"62 Squadron RFC/RAF History 1916\u201318, Page 6\". A pilots war 1915\u20131918.

Purdom, Geoffrey Forrest Hughes, Thomas Elliott, Charles Arnison, Ernest Morrow, William Norman Holmes, Hugh Claye and Douglas Savage.Guttman 2007, p. 65. The Squadron's victories came at a high price as 28 of its aviators were killed in action and three killed in accidents. In addition, 32 aviators became prisoners of war, 22 were wounded in action, and eleven sustained accidental injuries. This does not compare favorably with No. 88 Squadron, the last Bristol Fighter unit to reach the front. While that squadron was credited with 147 enemy aircraft destroyed, it only had two aviators killed, five wounded, and ten reported missing."]}, {"page": "List of World War I aces credited with 11\u201314 victories", "response": ["| Hugh Claye"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Forrest Hughes", "response": ["In 1918, he returned to France in an assignment to fly a Bristol F.2 Fighter for No. 62 Squadron RFC.

The team of Hughes and Claye continued to accrue victories; they became aces in a notable air battle on 13 March 1918. They were leading a formation of 11 Bristol Fighters when they were sucked into a lopsided battle to save a squadronmate.
