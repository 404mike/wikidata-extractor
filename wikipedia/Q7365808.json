His first team debut came 10 months later, in a First Division match away to Leicester City on 21 January 1961. However, his debut was unsuccessful; he conceded six goals as United lost 6\u20131. Briggs would go on to make a total of 11 appearances for the club, the last coming in 1962, before he was sold to Swansea Town in 1964. A year later, he was signed by Bristol Rovers, where he stayed until 1968, when he moved to Frome Town, thus ending his League football career.\nBriggs also collected two caps for Northern Ireland, making his debut in a 4\u20130 loss to Wales in April 1962. His only other appearance was a 2\u20131 win over the Netherlands in 1965.\nAfter retiring from football, Briggs went to live in Stapleton, Bristol, and worked in insurance, construction and security until a diagnosis of inoperable lung cancer in December 2007 forced his retirement in March 2008.
