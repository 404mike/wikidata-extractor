His investigations were initially spurred by an interest in modelling systems such as neural networks. He published his first paper in Reviews of Modern Physics investigating elementary cellular automata (Rule 30 in particular) in June 1983. The unexpected complexity of the behavior of these simple rules led Wolfram to suspect that complexity in nature may be due to similar mechanisms. His investigations, however, led him to realize that cellular automata were poor at modelling neural networks. Additionally, during this period Wolfram formulated the concepts of intrinsic randomness and computational irreducibility, and suggested that rule 110 may be universal\u2014a fact proved later by Wolfram's research assistant Matthew Cook in the 1990s."]}, {"page": "Wolfram", "response": ["* Wolfram Research, a software company founded by Stephen Wolfram", "* Wolfram code, a naming system used for one-dimensional cellular automaton rules by Stephen Wolfram", "* Conrad Wolfram (born 1970), British technologist and businessman, brother of Stephen Wolfram", "* Stephen Wolfram (born 1959), British computer scientist and entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "Thermal conduction", "response": ["* Newton's Law of Cooling by Jeff Bryant based on a program by Stephen Wolfram, Wolfram Demonstrations Project."]}, {"page": "Essential singularity", "response": ["*  An Essential Singularity by Stephen Wolfram, Wolfram Demonstrations Project."]}, {"page": "Thinking Machines Corporation", "response": ["Besides Hillis, other noted people who worked for or with the company included Robert Millstein, Greg Papadopoulos, David Waltz, Guy L Steele Jr., Karl Sims, Brewster Kahle, Bradley Kuszmaul, Carl Feynman, Cliff Lasser, Marvin Denicoff, Alex Vasilevsky, Allan Torres, Richard Fishman, Mirza Mehdi, Alan Harshman, Richard Jordan, Alan Mercer, James Bailey, Tsutomu Shimomura.
