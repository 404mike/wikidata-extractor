The Kangaroos embarked upon a massive six months tour of Britain taking in 45 matches. Their timing was not good as the north of England was hit by strikes in the cotton mills, which badly affected attendances as fans could not afford to watch the pioneering Aussies. On Saturday 14 November 1908 Warrington played the Kangaroos. Warrington won the match 10\u20133, with Jackie Fish the hero scoring one try and Ike Taylor the other, Fish and George Dickenson kicked a goal each. A crowd of 5,000 watched the match at Wilderspool. The Warrington team that day was Jimmy Tilley, Jack Fish, George Dickenson, Ike Taylor, Lewis Treharne, Ernest Brooks, John Jenkins, William Dowell, Alfred Boardman, Billy O'Neill, George Thomas, Peter Boardman, and John Willie Chester. The Australians came back to Wilderspool for \"revenge\" later in the tour but tries from Jack Fish, and John Jenkins earned the 'Wirepullers' an 8\u20138 draw. Two members of the Kangaroo squad, Dan Frawley and Larry O'Malley later signed for Warrington and played the next season at Wilderspool. Warrington have the best record of any club side against the touring Kangaroos with eight wins, one draw, and seven defeats from sixteen matches.http://www.warringtonwolves.org/100-years-since-wire-took-on-the-aussies-for-the-first-time-2372"]}, {"page": "1908\u201309 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"|George Dickenson||  style=\"text-align:center; background:#eee;\"|CE|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Dally Messenger (c)"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain national rugby league team players", "response": ["* George Dickenson circa-1908"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 Lancashire Cup", "response": ["|||T||George Dickenson (1)"]}, {"page": "List of Warrington Wolves players", "response": ["* George Dickenson won caps for England while at Warrington 1904 Other Nationalities, 1908 Wales (2 matches), 1909 Australia, and won caps for Great Britain while at 1908 Australia"]}, {"page": "1901 Challenge Cup", "response": ["|4|| George Dickenson"]}, {"page": "Dickenson, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Dickenson"]}]}}
