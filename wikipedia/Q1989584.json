Playing predominantly as a forward, but later in his career used as a midfielder, Clough was capped by England 14 times in the early 1990s.\nBorn in Sunderland and raised in Allestree, Derby, Clough is most notable for his time as a player at Nottingham Forest, where he played over 400 times in league, cup and European matches in two separate spells, mostly under the managership of his father Brian Clough, and scored 131 goals throughout his career making him the second highest scorer in the club's history.\nHe subsequently had spells with Liverpool, Manchester City and Sheffield Wednesday before moving into non-league football at the age of 32 when he became player manager with Southern Football League Premier Division side Burton Albion in 1998. Over the next decade, during half of which he continued to play a regular role on the field, Clough took Burton up from the seventh tier of the English football league system to the brink of promotion to League Two. He left halfway through the 2008\u201309 season to follow in his father's footsteps and take over at Derby County, where he served for four years until his dismissal in September 2013. He was appointed as manager of Sheffield United in October 2013, pulling them out of the relegation zone and taking them to FA Cup and League Cup semi-finals. He was later dismissed from the role in May 2015. \nClough returned to Burton Albion for a second spell as manager in December 2015, leading them to promotion to the Championship for the first time in the club's history in May 2016 and the League Cup semi-final in January 2019. Clough stepped down as Burton manager four years later in May 2020 due to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the club.In November 2020 Clough returned to football, joining Mansfield Town as manager.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nottingham Forest F.C.", "response": ["175px|thumb|right|Former club captain and manager Stuart Pearce won the Player of the Year award three times, a record he holds jointly with Des Walker.
