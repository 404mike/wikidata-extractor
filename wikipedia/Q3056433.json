Season ticket holders threatened a boycott, and various groups in Manchester and around the country bombarded the club with protest letters. In addition to this difficulty, Trautmann was replacing the recently retired Frank Swift, one of the greatest keepers in the club's history.James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p. 76. Though privately expressing doubts about the signing,Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p. 97. the club captain, Eric Westwood, a Normandy veteran, made a public display of welcoming Trautmann by announcing, \"There's no war in this dressing room\". Trautmann made his first team debut on 19 November against Bolton Wanderers, and after a competent display in his first home match, protests shrank as fans discovered his talent. Before his first home game, Alexander Altmann, the community rabbi of Manchester, had written a remarkable open letter to the Manchester Evening Chronicle appealing to City fans and the Jewish community to treat Trautmann with respect.Clay, Catrine,  Trautmann's Journey: From Hitler Youth to FA Cup Legend, pp. 274-276 He continued to receive abuse from crowds at away matches, which affected his concentration in some early games; in December 1949, he conceded seven goals at Derby County.Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p. 99.James, Manchester City\u00a0\u2013 The Complete Record, p. 366.
