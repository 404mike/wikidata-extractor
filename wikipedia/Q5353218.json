Graham notes how the character of Tuvix was written to encourage audience sympathies, yet was still effectively sentenced to death in contravention of what she describes as the \"exemplary Star Trek values [of] sentience, self-determination, and personhood\".  Thomas Richards' The Meaning of Star Trek also focused on the morality of decisions in \"Tuvix\" as compared to the original Star Trek and The Next Generation; more than Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the  is far from the United Federation of Planets and \"must address every value of the Federation [...] in a universe in which those values may no longer apply.\"  Richards describes the episode as \"truly remarkable\" for its depiction of Janeway's sentence of capital punishment and her performing the very first execution in all of Star Trek.  Not only is this shocking for the audience in comparison to episodes and series past, but even the fictional Voyager crew are stunned.  In 2000, David McIntee pointed to these themes and plot points as having made \"Tuvix\" the most debated episode in Star Trek fandom yet, and one of Star Trek: Voyager \"most thought-provoking, and [...] single most discussed, episode.\""]}, {"page": "University of Chester", "response": ["* Elaine Graham, theologian (Department of Theology and Religious Studies, 2009\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Nazarene Theological College, Manchester", "response": ["* 2015 Professor Elaine Graham"]}, {"page": "Image of God", "response": ["The twentieth and early twenty-first centuries saw the image of God being applied to various causes and ideas including ecology, disabilities, gender, and post/transhumanism.J.

Often these were reactions against prevailing understandings of the Imago Dei, or situations in which the Biblical text was being misused in the opinion of some. While some would argue this is appropriate, J. Richard Middleton argued for a reassessment of the Biblical sources to better understand the original meaning before taking it out of context and applying it. Instead of various extra-biblical interpretations, he pushed for a royal-functional understanding, in which \"the imago Dei designates the royal office or calling of human beings as God's representatives or agents in the world.\"", "Building off of Haraway's thesis, Stephen Garner engages the apprehensive responses to the metaphor of the cyborg among popular culture. For Garner, these \"narratives of apprehension\" found in popular movies and television are produced by \"conflicting ontologies of the person.\" The cyborg represents a crossing and blurring of boundaries that challenges preconceived notions of personal identity. Therefore, it is understandable that a person's first reaction to the image of a cyborg would be apprehension. For Garner, the wider scope of Haraway's \"cultural cyborg\" can be characterized by the term \"hybridity.\" According to Elaine Graham, hybridity does not only problematize traditional conception of human as the image of God, but also makes terms like \"natural\" problematic. There is no longer a clear line between the old dualities of human/machine, human/environment, and technology/environment."]}, {"page": "Elaine graham", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elaine Graham "]}, {"page": "Negro Ensemble Company", "response": ["*Elaine Graham"]}, {"page": "Stephen Lowe (bishop of Hulme)", "response": ["In June 2009 his book, What Makes a Good City?
