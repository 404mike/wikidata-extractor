Richardson managed to guide the club away from the relegation zone and held the manager's job until the end of the season when Gudjon Thordarson became the club's sixth manager in five years. The 2005\u201306 season began well for the Magpies: they won or drew their first seven league games and were top of the table in September. But their form dropped and they escaped relegation only on the final day of the season with a 2\u20132 draw against Bury, whilst Oxford United lost and went down. The Magpies' 21st place in League Two, and 89th place overall, was the lowest position the club had ever finished, and at the end of the season both the chairman and the manager left, a long-standing youth squad programme was ended, and many of the first-team players were out-of-contract or nearing contract maturity.", "|rowspan=2|1999 ||  Ian Richardson", "|2004 ||  Ian Richardson ", "|2005 ||  Ian Richardson ", "|align=left|Ian Richardson (Caretaker)"]}, {"page": "Dagenham & Redbridge F.C.", "response": ["|Ian Richardson 10"]}]}}
