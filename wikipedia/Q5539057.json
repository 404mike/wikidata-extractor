Nicknamed \"The Cheery 62s,\" the unit had its first encounter with Manfred von Richthofen's Circus on 12 March 1918, resulting in at least two aviators killed, four captured, and one wounded. No. 62 Squadron was one of the last two Bristol F.2 Fighter squadrons to serve at the Western Front, the other being No. 88 Squadron. The aircraft of both squadrons often escorted de Havilland planes on bombing missions. By the end of the war, No. 62 Squadron was credited with 76 enemy aircraft destroyed and 85 driven out of control.\"62 Squadron RFC/RAF History 1916\u201318, Page 6\". A pilots war 1915\u20131918.

Purdom, Geoffrey Forrest Hughes, Thomas Elliott, Charles Arnison, Ernest Morrow, William Norman Holmes, Hugh Claye and Douglas Savage.Guttman 2007, p. 65. The Squadron's victories came at a high price as 28 of its aviators were killed in action and three killed in accidents. In addition, 32 aviators became prisoners of war, 22 were wounded in action, and eleven sustained accidental injuries. This does not compare favorably with No. 88 Squadron, the last Bristol Fighter unit to reach the front. While that squadron was credited with 147 enemy aircraft destroyed, it only had two aviators killed, five wounded, and ten reported missing."]}, {"page": "Sidney Knights", "response": ["Knights was posted to No. 62 Squadron on 10 March 1918, and served as observer/gunner with pilot George Everard Gibbons, flying a Bristol F.2b two-seater fighter.

The observer ace of Royal Air Force No. 62 Squadron scored the majority of his victories with George Everard Gibbons as pilot. Elliott later served as an instructor at an air gunnery school.", "Elliott enlisted with the military in April 1916, and received his commission to the No. 62 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps on 12 March 1918. The Squadron has recently deployed to France and Elliott arrived not long after his new unit began operations from the aerodrome at Serny. Elliott was credited with eleven aerial victories while he was with No. 62 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, all of them from the Bristol F.2b Fighter, and nine of them with George Everard Gibbons as pilot. Gibbons was a 17-victory ace who was awarded the Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross, and French Legion of Honour. Gibbons had scored his first eight victories with Sidney Arthur William Knights as observer. However, Knights was hospitalised on 10 July 1918 and then was posted to the School of Aviation. Later, he was transferred to the Royal Air Force Armament School at RAF Uxbridge at the estate of Hillingdon House in Hillingdon in Greater London. Elliott, therefore, was the replacement for Knights. In September 1918, Elliott was transferred to No. 1 School of Air Gunnery, where he served as an instructor. He relinquished his commission on 21 February 1919."]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* George Everard Gibbons"]}, {"page": "March 1923", "response": ["*Died: George Everard Gibbons, 27, British World War I flying ace"]}]}}
