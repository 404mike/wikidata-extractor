Then he took up book illustration, and soon totally devoted himself to it. Most of his illustrations were engraved on block, not plate; a writer in the Polytechnic Journal was later to describe him as \"at that time the principal, and indeed almost only artist of any talent in London who made drawings on the block for wood engravers\".His illustrations include those for James Thomson's Seasons and William Somervile's Rural Sports, as well as Shakespeare's works. He was an occasional exhibitor at the Royal Academy from 1794 to 1812.\nHe died in London, in 1822.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Harvey (artist)", "response": ["Harvey switched to design, after the death of John Thurston, the then leading wood designer in London.

He soon became the head of his profession in London, where nothing equal to Thomas Bewick and his pupils had been produced before his arrival. With Bewick he was always in rivalry, yet, though he was no designer and some twenty-three years the junior of the Newcastle master, he may claim to be the founder of the 'London school' of wood-engraving, and to some extent to share with Bewick the credit of raising the character of his art in England. He specially excelled in engraving figures and interiors, but was less successful in outdoor scenes."]}, {"page": "John Thompson (engraver)", "response": ["He trained under the wood-engraver Allen Robert Branston, and then collaborated with the artist John Thurston.
