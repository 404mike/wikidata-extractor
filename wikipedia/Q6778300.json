The home took Brown and his sister Alice in after they found them digging through trash cans in the area. Their mother was not able to take care of them and they were living with their grandfather who worked security at night and slept during the day. While at the Orphanage, Marvin met and was coached by J. M White. White had a large influence on Marvin's life. Brown ran away from the orphanage at age 17 and White got Marvin a scholarship at Tarleton State University, where he was voted best player in Tarleton History, was All Conference three years, led the conference in rushing and punt returns and intercepted 10 passes. He was voted most valuable player and Jr. College All American. He was inducted into Tarelton's Hall of Fame later in life. From there he went to East Taxas State University (Now Texas A & M Commerce) on a football scholarship and played for \"Catfish\" Smith, who once said Marvin was the greatest football player he ever coached. Marvin received his Bachelors and Masters from this University. While at East Texas State he was voted Most Valuable Player in the 1953 Tangerine Bowl, he was ranked 9th nationally in scoring, had the longest run of 107 yards in one game (a record that stood for years), was an All American and still holds 9 records at the school in football. In track, he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds and was all conference in the 100 and 220. Brown was inducted into East Texas Hall of Fame in the 1970s."]}, {"page": "Tony Kelly (footballer, born 1966)", "response": ["Kelly began to impress the coaches at Ashton Gate and he began to train with the first team and on 16 October 1982 he was named in the squad for a league match away at Hartlepool United. He came on as a second-half substitute in a 1\u20131 draw and at the age of 16 years and 244 days he became Bristol City's youngest player. His record remained until it was broken by Marvin Brown in 1999. Kelly then played against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough in the League Cup in a narrow 2\u20131 defeat. His brother Mel was struggling to make an impact and was released by the club in November 1982. It was at this time Kelly began to 'get too big for his boots' and began to show a poor attitude which did not go unnoticed by the management who sent him back to the youth team. He earned a recall to the first team against Hereford United on 28 December 1982 where he scored his first league goal in a 3\u20131 victory. However, by 1983 he was not being asked to play and in May 1983 he was informed by Terry Cooper he was being released because of his \"rubbish attitude\" and so Kelly returned to his family in Coventry."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Bristol City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Marvin Brown"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Bristol City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|30||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Marvin Brown"]}, {"page": "List of A.D.
