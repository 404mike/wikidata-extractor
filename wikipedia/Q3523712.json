He was the first England player to \"carry his bat\" \u2013 opening the batting and remaining not out at the end of an innings \u2013 through a Test innings, and the first player to score 2000 runs in consecutive seasons \u2013 which he did each season from 1895 to 1902. In 1899 for Surrey against Somerset at The Oval, Abel carried his bat through an innings of 811, the highest total for which this feat has been achieved.  His 357* in that innings remains a Surrey record, and was the highest score made at The Oval until Len Hutton scored 364 in 1938. Abel also played a record number of first-class matches in a season \u2013 41 in 1902.\nAbel was physically small, 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 m) tall and slimly built. He suffered in the later part of his career from serious vision problems that could have handicapped him against fast bowling; however, his ability to produce eccentric, unorthodox cross-batted strokes \u2013 particularly the pull around his legs \u2013 complemented with determination and stamina, brought Abel success even on difficult pitches, and made him popular with the public.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
