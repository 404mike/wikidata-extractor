He was the first England player to \"carry his bat\" \u2013 opening the batting and remaining not out at the end of an innings \u2013 through a Test innings, and the first player to score 2000 runs in consecutive seasons \u2013 which he did each season from 1895 to 1902. In 1899 for Surrey against Somerset at The Oval, Abel carried his bat through an innings of 811, the highest total for which this feat has been achieved.  His 357* in that innings remains a Surrey record, and was the highest score made at The Oval until Len Hutton scored 364 in 1938. Abel also played a record number of first-class matches in a season \u2013 41 in 1902.\nAbel was physically small, 5 feet 4 inches (1.63 m) tall and slimly built. He suffered in the later part of his career from serious vision problems that could have handicapped him against fast bowling; however, his ability to produce eccentric, unorthodox cross-batted strokes \u2013 particularly the pull around his legs \u2013 complemented with determination and stamina, brought Abel success even on difficult pitches, and made him popular with the public.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 10", "response": ["*1936 \u2013 Bobby Abel, English cricketer (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "November 30", "response": ["*1857 \u2013 Bobby Abel, English cricketer (d. 1936)"]}, {"page": "1936", "response": ["** Bobby Abel, English cricketer (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "1901 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Bobby Abel 3309 @ 55.15 (HS 247)"]}, {"page": "1889 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Nine Great Batsmen of the Year \u2013 Bobby Abel, Billy Barnes, Billy Gunn, Louis Hall, Robert Henderson, Maurice Read, Arthur Shrewsbury, Frank Sugg, Albert Ward "]}, {"page": "1897 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Bobby Abel 2099 @ 44.65 (HS 250)"]}, {"page": "1898 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Bobby Abel 2053 @ 48.88 (HS 219)"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|  Bobby Abel,  Billy Barnes,  Billy Gunn,  Louis Hall,  Robert Henderson,  Maurice Read,  Arthur Shrewsbury,  Frank Sugg,  Albert Ward"]}, {"page": "County Championship", "response": ["| align=\"center\" | Bobby Abel "]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["Surrey then won official County Championship titles in 1890\u20131892 under John Shuter.

However, it was not until 1893 that Brockwell became a vital member of the Surrey eleven, when he took 51 wickets at the same cost as the incomparable Richardson and, despite often going in late, proving to be one of the most consistent batsmen. In the very wet 1894 season, Brockwell, despite the consistently treacherous pitches, made a remarkable advance. He scored more runs (1,491) than any other player, and hit five centuries, and consequently was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.
