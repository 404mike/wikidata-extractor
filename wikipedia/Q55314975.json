Following the open letter's publication accusing Corbyn of siding with antisemites \"again and again\", hundreds of people outside Parliament Square gathered to protest 'Enough is Enough' against antisemitism in the Labour Party, demanding that Corbyn do more to tackle anti-Jewish feeling in Labour Party ranks. Jewish Voice for Labour organised a smaller counter-demonstration. A Jewish Voice for Labour spokesman said after the event: \"There is a massive difference between saying that more needs to be done within the party and a demonstration like this which is implicitly trying to force him [Corbyn] out ... This protest is unnecessary, inflammatory and politicised.\" The organisation said in a statement that it was \"appalled\" by the Board of Deputies' letter. \"They do not represent us or the great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness.

JVL's information officer Jonathan Rosenhead shares the latter opinion. The organisation's Secretary, Glyn Secker, wrote that JVL has \"established a very different, authentic, radical, and socialist Jewish narrative to that promulgated by the Jewish Labour Movement and Labour Friends of Israel\". Wimborne-Idrissi wrote that one of JVL's roles \"is to clarify the distinction between Jew, Israeli and Zionist so that people are less likely to fall into antisemitic generalisation when talking about Israel's role in Palestine\", to offer \"an alternative to the JLM's pro-Israel agenda\" and that the JLM does not have \"the right to speak as the Jewish Labour Movement on behalf of all Jews in the Labour party\". Co-Chairs Jenny Manson and Leah Levane \"contend that the JLM cannot represent all Jewish members of the Labour Party when it is committed 'to promote the centrality of Israel in Jewish life' as well as the wider Jerusalem Programme of the World Zionist Organization\".", "JVL has challenged \"unjustified allegations of antisemitism\" which are \"used to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's leadership\".

In April, Manson appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, and, referring to a survey conducted by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: \"Evidence, including very recent evidence, commissioned by a Jewish body suggests the very worst antisemitism is still on the right, on the far right and always has been\"."]}, {"page": "Working Definition of Antisemitism", "response": ["In August 2019, Tower Hamlets London Borough Council refused to host the fifth annual charity bike ride event in aid of Palestinian children in Gaza called BigRide4Palestine due to concerns that criticism of Israel would violate the IHRA working definition of antisemitism.

Twenty three signatories of an open letter to The Guardian stated that the council's refusal to host the charity event has vindicated concerns raised about the working definition and that it \"demonstrates that freedom of expression on Palestine in this country is now being suppressed\".
