The approach, seemingly against the received wisdom of the time that power and sound quality go hand in hand, remained nevertheless controversial, despite the fact that NAD Electronics had trail-blazed five years earlier with the top-selling low-cost audiophile amplifier, the . The Naim Audio Integrated amplifier (or NAIT) was created by Julian Vereker as a minimalist black shoe-box design that includes a phono and two line-level inputs \u2013 one for tuner and one for tape recorder.

Trade speculation of its power output ranged from 5 to 15 watts per channel. Naim confirmed years later that the NAIT is rated at 13 watts. Part of its mystique seemed to stem from its low power: in developing the successor to the NAIT, Naim founder Julian Vereker remarked that R&D \"cooked up a more powerful version and presented it to me on my return [from holiday but] it sounded awful.\""]}, {"page": "Naim Audio amplification", "response": ["All of the early models were designed by Naim founder Julian Vereker, who wanted equipment that he himself and friends could enjoy listing through. He experimented with constituents of the sound reproduction chain: source components, amplifiers and loudspeakers. Received wisdom was that amplifiers were \"straight wires with gain\" that had no effect on the sound, but Vereker insisted that the performance of amplifiers on the market ranged from bad to abysmal.", "The Naim sound is frequently described as possessing pace, rhythm, and timing (often referred to by the acronym \"PRaT\"). Naim have always valued the ability of a piece of equipment to communicate emotion in music more than sound purity, and PRaT is a synonym of that ability. Julian Vereker saw that there was room within hi-fi circles for subjective preferences, but he held that it was \"totally wrong\" to put presentation (i.e. soundstage, detail, and depth and imagery) ahead of content. And while Naim does not set out to achieve imaging and soundstaging as design goals, reviewers have noted that some of the equipment is capable of delivering on these."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2000", "response": ["*Julian Vereker, 54, English designer of hi-fi audio equipment, cancer."]}]}}
