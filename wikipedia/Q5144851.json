His son, John Askey, played for and managed Macclesfield Town.\nHe is most famed for his time at Port Vale, where he scored 23 goals in 217 games between 1949 and 1958. This period was one of the most memorable in the club's history, as the \"Valiants\" stormed to the Third Division North title and FA Cup semi-finals in 1953\u201354. Following this he spent four years with Walsall and then two years at Mansfield Town. He won two successive promotions with the \"Saddlers\" in 1959\u201360 and 1960\u201361, and also won promotion out of the Fourth Division with the \"Stags\" in 1962\u201363.

He led the club to another Football League Trophy title in 2001 and steadied the ship following a period of administration but quit with the Vale in the play-offs of the third tier in February 2004. Another club legend, Martin Foyle, spent the next three years as manager before departing by mutual consent in September 2007. Lee Sinnott came in two months later, the first time in 28 years someone was appointed who had not previously played or coached at the club. Vale were relegated at the end of the 2007\u201308 season and manager Dean Glover was given the job initially on a caretaker basis in September 2008. Glover fared poorly however and was sacked at the end of the 2008\u201309 season. Micky Adams took charge in June 2009, the first experienced manager since Horton. He left Vale in the promotion places to manage boyhood club Sheffield United in December 2010, but a disastrous ten week spell under Jim Gannon ended all hopes of promotion, with Gannon overseeing the shortest reign in the club's history. Adams returned for a second spell in May 2011 and despite the club again entering administration he took the team to promotion out of League Two at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. He resigned in September 2014 and his assistant, Rob Page, then had close to two seasons in charge with moderate success. Club chairman Norman Smurthwaite then opted for a Continental revolution and appointed Portuguese coach Bruno Ribeiro in June 2016, the first manager born outside of Britain to manage the club on a permanent basis. Ribeiro struggled and his assistant Michael Brown took over after six months. Brown failed to keep the club out of the relegation zone by the end of the 2016\u201317 season and was sacked in September 2017.

Vale attacked through the wings to get in numerous crosses to the box, from which Ken Griffiths and Albert Leake scored their goals.
