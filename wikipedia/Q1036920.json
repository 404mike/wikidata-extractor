He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface, and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of an individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.", "Calvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995\u201396, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein's ideas of fashion. John Pawson's interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements.

He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior."]}, {"page": "List of architects", "response": ["*John Pawson (born 1949)"]}, {"page": "2004 in architecture", "response": ["* Reconstruction of Nov\u00fd Dv\u016fr Monastery, Czech Republic, by John Pawson is completed."]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 20th century", "response": ["*John Pawson (Born 1949), architect"]}, {"page": "Architectural Association School of Architecture", "response": ["*John Pawson"]}, {"page": "Swarovski", "response": [":Viktor and Rolf, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Fredrikson Stallard, Zaha Hadid, John Pawson, Daniel Libeskind, Prince Dimitri, Karl Lagerfeld, Christopher Kane, Mary Katranzou, Iris Apfel, Stephen Webster, Anna della Russo and Jason Wu have each designed collections for Atelier Swarovski."]}, {"page": "Commonwealth Education Trust", "response": ["The revised proposal was approved by the Council on 17 September 2009, and by English Heritage on 25 September 2009.\"The reasons why English Heritage backed Commonwealth Institute plans\", Architects Journal, 28 September 2009.
