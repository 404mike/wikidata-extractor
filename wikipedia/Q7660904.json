The conservation effort was partly driven by Peter Garthwaite and Sylvia Crowe. Crowe also helped the Forestry Commission landscape their forests to make them more appropriate for recreational use.", "Until the introduction of the Countryside Act 1968, the main purpose of the Forestry Commission was to maximise timber sales. The act gave the public the right to use much of the forest estate for recreation, this led to the commission providing additional facilities for the public. Sylvia Crowe was hired as a consultant to identify how to improve the landscape of commission forests for recreation. The focus on recreation allowed the Forestry Commission to become the largest provider of outdoor recreation in Britain."]}, {"page": "History of gardening", "response": ["*Sylvia Crowe"]}, {"page": "Commonwealth Education Trust", "response": ["The project was funded by the British government which was obliged to compensate the Trustees for the loss of the substantial Imperial Institute building (described by Louis Bondy as in the front rank of Victorian monumental architecture). Contributions of materials and grants from Commonwealth countries were sought to augment the small sum of money that the Exchequer had allowed for the new building. The exhibition designer was James Gardner, who worked on the Dome of Discovery in the influential Festival of Britain of 1951, and the gardens was designed by Sylvia Crowe. The contractor was John Laing Construction Ltd. The former Institute building stood on a piece of land acquired from the Holland estate on a 999-year lease for \u00a3215,000. The design of the building and gardens were strongly influenced by their proximity to Holland Park. The exterior and structure has been refurbished and the interior has been substantially altered to accommodate the Design Museum.", "The building was listed Grade II* in 1988 for its roof, its place as a post-war building, its importance in the history of museum and exhibition design, and its historical significance in marking the transition from Empire to Commonwealth. The Sylvia Crowe landscape was entered in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens in July 1998, but following the sale of the building it was removed. On 22 July 2005 the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, rejected a proposal to remove the building's listed status, considered as an obstacle to realising the full potential of the Trust's assets in a report by property consultants to the Commonwealth Institute Trustees. In April 2007, the Commonwealth Institute building was acquired by property developers Chelsfield Partners. A planning brief, issued by the local council in August 2007, called for the preservation of the main structure of the building, preferably for use such as an art gallery that would retain its essential components. The brief also called for greater integration of the gardens with Holland Park."]}, {"page": "Commonwealth Park", "response": ["Various designers have been involved in the construction of the park including Charles Weston, Lindsay Pryor, Richard Clough and John Grey.

The siting of the transmission lines that would connect Turlough Hill to the electrical grid was a matter of some controversy. Objections to the lines, planned to run from Turlough Hill to the village of Hollywood, came from several quarters, including Bord F\u00e1ilte, the Irish tourist board. In the end, it was decided that they would run underground from Turlough Hill for c. , to preserve the view at the Wicklow Gap, before emerging overground on pylons along the King's River to Hollywood.
