Thus, Mrs Chen obtained a passport and hence Irish citizenship for Catherine, with the intention of using Catherine's status as a European Union citizen to move the family permanently to Cardiff, Wales. However, British authorities rejected the family's application for permits to reside permanently in the United Kingdom. On appeal, adjudicator Michael Shrimpton of the Immigration Appellate Authority referred the decision to the European Court of Justice, which ruled that, as a citizen of the European Union, Catherine Zhu had a right under Article 18 of the EC Treaty to reside anywhere in the EU, and that denying residency to her parents at a time when she is unable to look after herself would conflict with this basic right."]}, {"page": "Cardiff School of Law and Politics", "response": ["*Michael Shrimpton"]}, {"page": "Reactions to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann", "response": ["British barrister Michael Shrimpton presented himself as the \"unofficial representative\" for parents Kate and Gerry McCann, and claimed responsibility for setting up a meeting between them and Pope Benedict XVI.

It held that no comparator (for instance to a sick man) is necessary to establish discrimination against a pregnant woman.  It was unusual in that Carole Louise Webb, the applicant, was represented throughout by a community law centre, the Hillingdon Legal Resource Centre (HLRC), later renamed the Hillingdon Law Centre, the only time that a British law centre case went to the European Court of Justice.  The law centre's in-house barrister Michael Shrimpton argued the case before the Industrial Tribunal at London North in February 1988.  He was also junior counsel to the late John Melville Williams QC in the Employment Appeal Tribunal and, by then in private practice, appeared at the compensation hearing in 1999.  The case was one of the longest-running in British legal history."]}, {"page": "Security for the 2012 Summer Olympics", "response": ["A few months before the games opened, Michael Shrimpton, a former immigration judge, contacted authorities to warn of an impending attack against the Games.

The agency was supposedly planning to detonate the warhead during the Games' opening ceremony.  Shrimpton's report was treated seriously by police and, when it was found to be a hoax, he was arrested, tried, and convicted on two counts of communicating false information with intent.
