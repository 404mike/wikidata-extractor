Ephemera is chiefly observed as single page materials, although it can manifest in a manifold of material differences, however with pervading characteristics. The range of printed ephemera is complex and often eludes simple definition. The material usage of printed ephemera is very often minimal and much are without art; some are highly decorated and make use of a distinct design lexicon, with there existing significant amounts of art which could be classified as ephemera. Fine art has at times been associated with ephemera, such as William Hogarth's early trade cards. Trade cards engraved and printed intaglio acquired prestige. Other notable artists who produced ephemera include: Francesco Rosselli, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Stefano della Bella, Francesco Bartolozzi and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Conversely, early ephemera indicates a greater access to printing from common people. Bold design details found in ephemera denote an advertising element, the opposite or united element being information; design elements, which are typically indicative of the period of origin, likely changed in accordance to higher literacy rates. Display typefaces were an advertising component present promiently in 19th century ephemera."]}, {"page": "Bartolozzi, Francesco", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francesco Bartolozzi"]}, {"page": "Agostino Carlini", "response": ["He features in a group portrait, by Johann Zoffany, of the founders, and is one of three sitters (with Francesco Bartolozzi and Giovanni Battista Cipriani) in a 1777 portrait displayed in the National Portrait Gallery in London.
