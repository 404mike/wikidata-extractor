He explains, \"The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable ... as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces.\" However, such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: \"What influences could these innovations then have? The short answer is, not much. Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, Friends, and 20/20 sound like few other rock albums; they are sui generis. ... It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation.\" Musicologist David Toop, who included the Smiley Smile track \"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter\" on a companion CD for his book Ocean of Sound, placed the Beach Boys' effect on sound pioneering in league with Les Baxter, Aphex Twin, Herbie Hancock, King Tubby, and My Bloody Valentine."]}, {"page": "New school hip hop", "response": ["David Toop writes of 1984 that \"pundits were writing obituaries for hip hop, a passing fad\" which \"Hollywood had mutated into an all-singing, all-dancing romance\" in movies like Flashdance and Breakin'.

The term was first coined by Birmingham's now defunct label \"Beyond Records\" in early 1990s. The label released series of albums Ambient Dub Volume 1 to 4 that inspired many artists, including Bill Laswell, who used the same phrase in his music project Divination, where he collaborated with other artists in the genre. Ambient dub adopts dub styles made famous by King Tubby and other Jamaican sound artists from the 1960s to the early 1970s, using DJ-inspired ambient electronica, complete with all the inherent drop-outs, echo, equalization and psychedelic electronic effects. It often features layering techniques and incorporates elements of world music, deep bass lines and harmonic sounds. According to David Toop, \"Dub music is like a long echo delay, looping through time...turning the rational order of musical sequences into an ocean of sensation.\" Notable artists within the genre include Dreadzone, Higher Intelligence Agency, The Orb, Gaudi, Ott, Loop Guru, Woob and Transglobal Underground as well as Banco de Gaia."]}, {"page": "Jeff Noon", "response": ["Jeff Noon and David Toop also released a CD, Needle in the Groove: if music were a drug, where would it take you, on Sulphur Records in the same year."]}, {"page": "Intelligent dance music", "response": ["Warp's second Artificial Intelligence compilation was released in 1994.

Nelson Riddle taught me a lot about arranging.\" Asked about soul music in 2004, he cited Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder as influences. Wendy Carlos's 1969 album Switched-On Bach, described by Wilson as \"one of the most electrifying records\" he had ever heard, influenced his use of synthesizers.
