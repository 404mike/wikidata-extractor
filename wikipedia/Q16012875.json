The incumbent, Frank Collindridge, had died during the campaign for that election, and Schofield was selected as the Labour candidate in his place with a 28,227 majority; polling day was delayed to 8 November.\nSchofield resigned his seat less than two years later, on 21 January 1953, \"because he did not like Westminster\". and at the resulting by-election on 31 March, the future cabinet minister Roy Mason was elected as his replacement. Schofield died in Barnsley in 1992 aged 81.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
