In discussing the origins of the central alien writer Catherine Tregenna states that \"we were just throwing ideas around and true to form Russell [T Davies] said \"why isn't it just a great big whale in a warehouse?\"\" Davies states the alien was designed to be \"one of Torchwood and Doctor Whos biggest monsters\" not in terms of concept but its \"literal size\". He felt this provided insight into \"the strangeness of life\". Producer Richard Stokes states that the concept design team created an idea of what they envisaged the whale to look like. Tregenna felt that the original design for the creature was \"a little fanciful\" in that it was a bit too \"beautiful and exotic\" before deciding \"if it looked like that they [the villains] would exhibit it, it would be a freak show.\" She characterises the final design as resembling \"a giant kebab\". Contrary to observations from commentators, Tregenna did not intend the story to promote vegetarianism as she is not a vegetarian\u00a0\u2014 she simply wanted to write an episode that was more action based than her series one episodes (\"Out of Time\" and \"Captain Jack Harkness\"). The hypothetical size of the space whale resulted in Teague having to find this \"huge great warehouse\" and hire a fifty-foot crane for camera angles. Whilst the main body of the alien was created using computer-generated imagery a prosthetic version of the cut wound in the side of the alien was available for the actors to interact with on set. Actor Eve Myles describes it as being like filming within a \"blood soaked, soppy big sponge\". The opening of the creature's eye was created using green screen.

He's got to be made aware of what's going on.\" The events of the episode \"Meat\", in which Rhys learns the real nature of Gwen's job, are seen by Davies as a \"rite of passage\" for the couple. Director Colin Teague highlights Rhys'  patience in relation to Gwen noting that \"he puts up with an awful lot from his wife to be\". The second series also explores Rhys's insecurities and jealousies towards series protagonist Captain Jack Harkness, for whom a mutual sexual tension with Gwen was evident in the first series. Both Stephen James Walker and episode writer Catherine Tregenna felt that \"the triangle of relationships between Rhys, Gwen and Jack\" comprise \"the most interesting narrative territory explored in 'Meat'\". Although actor Kai Owen feels that \"Rhys will always have a little bit of a gripe about Jack\", he concedes that \"he respects him and he'll like him for looking after Gwen\". Walker comments favourably on the interaction between Jack and Rhys in \"Meat\" in both its antagonistic and comedic forms, citing the scene in the truck where Rhys questions Jack as particularly effective. The two function as unusual literary foils for one another, insofar as their relationships with Gwen are concerned. In her critical essay Gwen's Evil Stepmother: Concerning Gloves and Magic Slippers, Valerie Estelle Frankel compares Rhys to Jack, likening the former to a \"sweet, kind handsome prince\" and the latter to a \"compelling trickster.\" Whilst Eve Myles feels that \"Jack highlights how ordinary Rhys is\", she states that it is precisely this ordinariness which makes Rhys a benefit to Gwen's strength of character."]}, {"page": "Tregenna", "response": ["* Catherine Tregenna, a Welsh playwright, television scriptwriter and actress"]}, {"page": "The Watch (TV series)", "response": ["In March 2018, Deadline Hollywood reported that BBC Studios was developing The Watch as a six-part series and as the basis of a \"returnable franchise\".
