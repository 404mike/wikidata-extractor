They had two top-ten albums and seven consecutive top-ten singles, with chart-topping success on the UK Singles Chart as well as across Europe, Asia, Australasia and the US. The group had originally been a quartet with Zena McNally who left in January 2001.", "Alesha Dixon and Sabrina Washington met in 1997 at Dance Attic studios in Fulham through Louise Porter, who was putting together a group for her production company Big Out Ltd. The two worked with Louise Porter for a couple of years before being joined by Tina Barrett to form a trio performing singing and dancing. They were named Face2Face, were unsigned, and all band members still worked day jobs. Barrett left to join S Club 7 after a successful audition for Simon Fuller and was replaced by Zena McNally and Su-Elise Nash. Their then producer David Brant (writer of their first two hit singles, \"Why?\" and \"All I Want\") introduced them via DJ Darren Stokes (TinTinOut) to Inferno Records (sub pop) A&R man Pat Travers, who went on to sign them to Telstar Records and changed their name to Mis-Teeq. After months of recording\u2014including sessions with producers Norwegian duo Stargate along with Brant (Vybrant Music), Ed Case, Blacksmith, Rishi Rich, and Ceri Evans\u2014Mis-Teeq released their debut single in 2001, \"Why?\", a Latin-flavoured mid-tempo song co-written and produced by Brant. A garage remix by Matt \"Jam\" Lamont soon became a success in the underground UK garage scene, and as a result a second music video for the song was filmed and released. \"Why\" became a hit on the UK Singles Chart with a peak position of number eight. McNally decided to leave the line-up in January 2001 saying she felt unhappy about \"an unbalance in the group\".", "Su-Elise Nash, who joined the group in 1999, was the group's backing singer. Her vocals were rarely heard on the group's records. However, she added a lower register vocal to many of the group's harmonies, which was contribution to the group's sound. She was also a rapper, but only rapped on two of the group's records.

And we worked with Dave Kelly who does a lot of the production for all the Shaggy stuff. It's been very successful and this album is a lot more R&B dominated than Lickin which was more equally balanced with the garage and the R&B. Eye Candy is very much R&B but within that there are so many urban influences, the garage element, hip hop a much greater reggae aspect and an element of bhangra.\""]}, {"page": "Alesha Dixon", "response": ["Dixon's career began in 1999 when she met Sabrina Washington as they both joined a dance school in Fulham, south west London.
