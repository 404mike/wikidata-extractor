After completing his flying training Gibbons was posted to No. 22 Squadron RFC to fly the Bristol F.2b two-seater fighter. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1918, and gained his first aerial victory on 31 May. This was the first in a string of victories that made him an ace by 5 June, gaining the required five victories in less than a week. He gained another victory at the end of June, and single victories in July and August, before scoring another string of six between 2 and 27 September. Such aces as  John Jones, John Umney, Ronald Fletcher, Valentine Collins, Christopher Shannon, and James McDonald manned the observer's guns while teamed with Gibbons. In his final tally, he had destroyed six German fighter aircraft and driven eight others down out of control, although his front gun was responsible for only three or four of those. He was appointed a flight commander with the acting-rank of captain on 5 November 1918.", "|6 || 28 June 1918@ 1015 || Bristol F.2b(C989) || Fokker Dr.I || Destroyed || North of Estaires || Observer: Lieutenant Valentine Collins", "|7 || 10 July 1918@ 0945 || Bristol F.2b(C989) || Fokker Dr.I || Out of control || Lille || Observer: Lieutenant Valentine Collins"]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Valentine Collins"]}]}}
