Although this meant that Boston started the 2007\u201308 season without a points penalty FA rules dictated that they be demoted 2 divisions as a result of HM Revenue & Customs placing a restriction into the CVA of Boston not being allowed to pay football creditors 100% of what they were owed. They therefore played the 2007\u201308 season in the Conference North division, two steps below the Football League.
