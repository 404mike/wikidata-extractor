Moorby was born and brought up in Birmingham, England, and studied Mathematics at Southampton University, England. Moorby received his master's degree in computer science from Manchester University, England, in 1974. He moved to the United States in 1983.While working in Gateway Design Automation, in 1984 he invented the Verilog hardware description language, and developed the first and industry standard simulator Verilog-XL. In 1990 Gateway was purchased by Cadence Design Systems.\nIn 1997, Moorby joined startup company SynaPix, where he worked on match moving and video tracking algorithms for automatically extracting 3D models from video frames, using techniques such as optical flow, motion field and point clouds.\nMoorby joined Co-Design Automation in 1999, and in 2002 he joined Synopsys to work on SystemVerilog verification language.On October 10, 2005, Moorby became the recipient of the 2005 Phil Kaufman Award for his contributions to the EDA industry, specifically for development and popularization of Verilog, one of the world's most popular tools of electronic design automation.In April 2016, Moorby was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum, \"for his invention and promotion of the Verilog hardware description language.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Verilog", "response": ["Verilog was created by Prabhu Goel, Phil Moorby, Chi-Lai Huang, and Douglas Warmke between late 1983 and early 1984. Chi-Lai Huang had earlier worked on a hardware description LALSD, a language developed by Professor S.Y.H. Su, for his PhD work. The rights holder for this process, at the time proprietary, was \"Automated Integrated Design Systems\" (later renamed to Gateway Design Automation in 1985). Gateway Design Automation was purchased by Cadence Design Systems in 1990. Cadence now has full proprietary rights to Gateway's Verilog and the Verilog-XL, the HDL-simulator that would become the de facto standard (of Verilog logic simulators) for the next decade. Originally, Verilog was only intended to describe and allow simulation; the automated synthesis of subsets of the language to physically realizable structures (gates etc.) was developed after the language had achieved widespread usage."]}, {"page": "Phil Kaufman Award", "response": ["* 2005: Phil Moorby, inventor of Verilog"]}, {"page": "Gateway Design Automation", "response": ["\"Verilog HDL originated at Automated Integrated Design Systems (later renamed as Gateway  Design Automation) in 1985.
