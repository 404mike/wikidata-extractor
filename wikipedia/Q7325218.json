He began his career in amateur football before joining Burnley in 1974, although he failed to establish himself at the club and was later loaned out to Stockport County during the 1975\u201376 season. After being released by Burnley in the summer of 1976, Dixey moved into non-League football and represented a number of clubs including Kettering Town, where he was a losing FA Trophy finalist in 1979, Scarborough and Nuneaton Borough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Cross (footballer)", "response": ["He went on to join Nuneaton Borough, who had just finished as runners-up in the Southern League Premier Division; he was signed alongside Walsall's Stan Bennett, and the pair would go on to reform their Walsall centre-back partnership at Nuneaton. He made a total of 50 appearances in the 1975\u201376 season, but was released at the end of the campaign. However Stan Bennett was appointed player-manager and approached Cross about re-signing, which he agreed to do. He scored his second \u2013 and final \u2013 career goal on 26 March 1979, the fourth goal of a 4\u20130 win over Wealdstone at Manor Park. At the end of the 1978\u201379 season, Nuneaton were invited to join the newly created Alliance Premier League. He played in the Birmingham Senior Cup final victory over Lye Town on 12 April 1980. He featured 25 times in the 1980\u201381 season, which saw the club relegated into the Southern League Midland Division. He left the club in the summer after finding that work commitments hampered his training, whilst the signing of Richard Dixey from Scarborough meant the club could afford to let him go."]}, {"page": "Dixey, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Dixey"]}, {"page": "Dixey", "response": ["*Richard Dixey (born 1956), English former footballer"]}]}}
