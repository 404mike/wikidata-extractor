Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel", "response": ["The winning novel is selected by a panel of science fiction experts, intended to be \"small enough to discuss among its members all of the nominated novels\". Among members of the panel have been Gregory Benford, Paul A. Carter, James Gunn, Elizabeth Anne Hull, Christopher McKitterick, Farah Mendlesohn, Pamela Sargent, and Tom Shippey. In 2008 Mendlesohn was replaced with Paul Kincaid, in 2009 Carter left the panel while Paul Di Filippo and Sheila Finch joined, and Lisa Yaszek replaced Di Filippo in 2016. Nominations are submitted by publishers and jurors, and are collated by the panel into a list of finalists to be voted on. The minimum eligible length that a work may be is not formally defined by the center. The winner is selected by May of each year, and is presented at the Campbell Conference awards banquet in June at the University of Kansas in Lawrence as part of the centerpiece of the conference along with the Sturgeon Award. The award has been given at the conference since 1979; prior to then it was awarded at various locations around the world, starting at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1973. Winners are always invited to attend the ceremony. The Center for the Study of Science Fiction maintains a trophy which records all of the winners on engraved plaques affixed to the sides, and since 2004 winners have received a smaller personalized trophy as well. In 2019, the Center for the Study of Science Fiction announced plans to rename both the conference and the award, but did not announce any names. Both the conference and the award were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic."]}, {"page": "The Years of Rice and Salt", "response": ["The novel was well received by critics who variously called it \"thoughtful\", \"realistic\", and \"rich\". In Publishers Weekly, the reviewers called it a \"highly realistic and credible alternate history\", and in the School Library Journal, Christine Menefee called it \"an addictive, surprising, and suspenseful novel\". The Library Journal \"highly recommended\" it, saying that its \"superb storytelling and imaginative historic speculation make [it] a priority choice for all SF and general fiction collections\". The critic at Kirkus Reviews found it \"overlong, but blessed with moments of wry and gentle beauty\". Likewise, Roz Kaveney stated that \"if there is a weakness in Robinson's work, it is perhaps this; his characters are so intelligent that they never shut up\".  For The Globe and Mail, Sol Chrom lauded the epic scope, calling it a \"magnificent achievement\", and for The Belfast News Letter, the reviewer called the novel \"extraordinary, ambitious, poetic and powerful\".
