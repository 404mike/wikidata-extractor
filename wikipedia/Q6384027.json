He is an all-rounder. He previously played professional football, where he was a striker. He came through the academy of Premier League club Blackburn Rovers, from whom he was loaned to Cercle Brugge and Rochdale. He subsequently had short spells at St Patrick's Athletic and Northwich Victoria before moving into cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["2019 again saw strong performance in first-class cricket as Hampshire finished 3rd in the County Championship, their highest finish in over 10 years. Kyle Abbott once again was leading wicket taker, while also taking the best Hampshire bowling figures in a match when he took 17/86 against Somerset in September. Ajinkya Rahane also became the first Indian player to represent Hampshire during an overseas spell in June. Hampshire once again also made the 2019 Royal London One-Day Cup final, however this year they were defeated in the final by Somerset. There was though success for Hampshire academy graduates James Vince and Liam Dawson as they were part of England's victorious World Cup winning side. Hampshire, though, again failed to progress from the group in T20 cricket. The following 2020 season was heavily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic with only a shortened localised red ball tournament and T20 played. Hampshire, missing a large number of players to injury, international selection and travel restrictions, struggled winning just two red ball and two white ball games. A large number of young academy players though made their debuts while James Fuller took a hat-trick in a first-class game against Surrey, while overseas player Shaheen Afridi took four wickets in four balls in the final T20 match of the season against Middlesex. West Indian fast bowler Fidel Edwards announced his departure during the season due to not being able to travel due to the restrictions around COVID-19 and the impending change to the Kolpak ruling, after taking over 200 wickets in all formats. 2021 saw a return to the traditional County Championship, although in a differing format, with Hampshire missing out on their first County Championship title since 1973 following a loss to Lancashire in the final match of the season. In Twenty20 cricket, Hampshire made Finals Day following a dramatic 2 run win over Nottinghamshire in the Quarter Final, but lost to Somerset in the semi-finals. Hampshire's List A side was depleted due to The Hundred competition being played alongside the One Day Cup competition. With Hampshire missing 7 players to The Hundred, they missed out on the playoffs, although a number of young players were given the opportunity to play. Individually, Keith Barker won Hampshire's Players Player of the Year, while fellow bowler, overseas international Mohammad Abbas picked up a hat-trick in the County Championship against Middlesex.", "|style=\"text-align:center\"|13|| Keith Barker* ||  ||  || Left-handed || Left-arm fast-medium ||"]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| Keith Barker"]}, {"page": "2012 Hong Kong Cricket Sixes", "response": ["*Keith Barker"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Keith Barker (2009\u20132018) : K.
