His total budget for the film was \u00a31 million. Blackburn's production team went through a casting process which took seven months; the film stars Nichola Burley, Tom Burke, Jaime Winstone and Julian Morris. He shot the film in South Africa, over 24 days. Film shooting for Donkey Punch began in March 2007; during production Blackburn dealt with actors afflicted by hypothermia and tidal surges on location. In an interview with Total Film, Blackburn commented, \"I think Donkey Punch is an extreme thriller or an extreme reality-based thriller. The whole point of the film is it's grounded in reality.\" Blackburn wrote that he made Donkey Punch, \"to try to push the genre.\" Donkey Punch received mixed reviews; the film obtained a rating of 50% based on 51 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, and a score of 43 out of 100 at Metacritic. The Philadelphia Inquirer compared Blackburn's work to films including filmmaker Peter Berg's Very Bad Things and director Philip Noyce's Dead Calm, and wrote, \"Donkey Punch offers a gripping mix of sexual heat and nasty menace.\" The Los Angeles Times additionally compared Blackburn's work to Dead Calm as well as director Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water, and concluded, Donkey Punch isn't without a certain power as it gleefully turns its careless hedonists into caged, paranoid rats.\" In The Toronto Star, Peter Howell wrote that \"Blackburn knows how to build and maintain suspense without resorting to gratuitous gore. Fans of horror and thriller films should put Donkey Punch on their must-see list.\" In the NY Press Eric Kohn wrote, \"Such a unique thrill. Director Blackburn develops the scenario with remarkably shrewd finesse\". while Ted Fry commented in The Seattle Times that \"'Donkey Punch' packs a magnetic jolt of fearsome intensity\".

Sex isn't glamorous\". She commented to Sky News: \"It's about us, it's about young people. Hopefully people can identify with that.
