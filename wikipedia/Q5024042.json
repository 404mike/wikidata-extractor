We just got lucky that we'd found our way to an excellent engineer who knew the company.\" The engineer in question was Calum Malcolm, with whom the band had already recorded some demos in his Castlesound studio near Edinburgh. Since Malcolm was a friend of Linn's founder Ivor Tiefenbrun, and had ties with the company, his studio was fitted out with Linn equipment. When Linn representatives visited one day and asked to hear some music to test out their new speakers, Malcolm played them the demo of \"Tinseltown in the Rain\". Impressed, Linn offered the band a contract with the record label it was in the process of setting up. Despite the fact that the group took nine months to reply to Linn's offer, the contract was eventually signed and its first album, A Walk Across the Rooftops, was released as Linn Records' first album in May 1984.", "In May 2012, Buchanan released his first solo album, Mid Air, a collection of short, stripped-back songs mostly with just Buchanan's voice and piano, recorded with Calum Malcolm's son Cameron as the album's engineer and released on Buchanan's own Newsroom Records label. In a radio interview, Buchanan mentioned that towards the end of the recording process he had called in Robert Bell to help out on two tracks (\"Mid Air\" and \"My True Country\") that neither he nor Cameron Malcolm were satisfied with. Bell also later remixed \"Buy a Motor Car\", which appeared on the deluxe edition of the album released in October 2012.

Buchanan and Robert Bell's songs would start out written on an acoustic guitar or a piano, and then together with third member Paul Joseph \"PJ\" Moore and engineer Calum Malcolm the songs would be rearranged in the studio.", "A persistent myth about the album's origins is that the band were approached by Linn Products and commissioned to make a record that the company could use to demonstrate the quality of their high-specification hi-fi equipment\u2014the company were so pleased with the result that they decided to form a record label specifically to release the resulting album. In fact Linn had already recently manufactured a cutting lathe to produce their own records, frustrated by the poor quality of the test LPs that were being provided for their flagship turntable product, the Linn Sondek LP12,Linn Records website and had already set up and released records on their ALOI (A Label of Integrity) Records label before signing the Blue Nile. According to Paul Buchanan, the true story was that the band had already made demo recordings of some of their songs with engineer Calum Malcolm at his Castlesound Studios, which happened to be fitted out with Linn equipment as Malcolm had worked with the company in the past. Linn were visiting the studios and asked Malcolm to play a song recently recorded at the studio in order to test out their new speakers, and Malcolm duly obliged and chose the Blue Nile's demo of \"Tinseltown in the Rain\". On hearing the demo, Linn were impressed and felt the band's sound fitted in with the type of music they wanted to release on their new label, and contacted the Blue Nile to offer a contract to make a full album: even so, it took the band a full nine months to respond to the company's offer. Buchanan recalled that Linn had given the band \u00a310,000\u2013\u00a320,000 to make the record, but rejected the suggestion that the company had asked the band to make a record in a particular style that would show off the company's products in the best light, saying, \"It was great because they left us to it. They trusted the engineer and they trusted us so they said, go off and make a record\u00a0... We were\u2014as you would imagine\u2014you're so fervent about what you're doing that nothing would dissuade you from it and nothing would persuade you to do otherwise\u00a0... we'd already demo'd some of the things before we'd even met Linn so\u00a0... no, it was nothing to do with that.\" PJ Moore also denied that Linn had deliberately chosen the band to produce a demo record for them, telling Uncut magazine that \"it was a myth that we were a 'hi-fi band signed to a hi-fi company'.
