After a confrontation with the revived former member of the New Mutants, Magik, she gains the ability to use magic and a magical weapon called the \"Souldagger.\"\nHer main use of magic is a massive teleportation spell, which makes her a key asset to various X-Men missions and teams and places her as one of the titles' primary magic users.
