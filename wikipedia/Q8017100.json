The constituency had two members, the other being the Liberal David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda: there was antagonism between the two Liberals, however, and in 1900 Thomas backed Hardie. A major political issue between them was attitude to the Second Boer War, supported by Morgan who was on the Liberal imperialist wing of the party.
