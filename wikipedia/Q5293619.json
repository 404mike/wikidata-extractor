It was during this game that Topley gained notoriety for a splendid one handed catch on the boundary that didn\u00b4t count as his foot was on the boundary rope.  Topley played for Norfolk, Surrey and Griqualand West, as well as his 10-year career with Essex.\nAs a right-arm medium-fast bowler, Topley took 564 wickets at the top level of county cricket before being released from his contract in 1994, whereupon he made accusations that two 1991 county matches were fixed. Together with Guy Lovell, Topley took part in an interview with the Sunday Mirror stating that during matches against Lancashire, Essex were approached by the opposing team and accepted their offer of throwing one match in the Sunday League in return for Lancashire throwing the two sides' next encounter in the County Championship. The Test and County Cricket Board reported that they had found no substance to the revelations.Topley was also an international coach with Zimbabwe from 1990 to 1992, after spending many winters playing and coaching all over southern Africa. Being an alumnus of the Royal Hospital School in Suffolk, he returned there after his career as Master i/c cricket. His brother, Peter Topley, had a brief career for Kent and his son, Reece Topley, is a left-arm fast-bowler who played for Essex, Hampshire and the England one-day team.Today Topley commentates on the domestic game of cricket, and is often found on the after dinner speaking circuit. Topley also hosts overseas supporters cricket tours following the England team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Hospital School", "response": ["* Don Topley (1964\u2013)- Essex CCC and coach of Zimbabwe."]}, {"page": "Topley", "response": ["*Don Topley (born 1964), former English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Colin Knight", "response": ["Knight made his debut for Cumberland in the 1987 Minor Counties Championship against Durham.
