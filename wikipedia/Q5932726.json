Overend subsequently wrote many of the group's policy documents, including much of the NILP's platform.Aaron Edwards, A history of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, p.219Ed Moloney, Voices from the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland, p.396 In 1979, the group was renamed the \"Progressive Unionist Party\".", "The party has had a degree of electoral success.  In 1994 PUP leader Hugh Smyth became Lord Mayor of Belfast, and in the 1996 elections to the Northern Ireland Forum they secured two seats, with Smyth and David Ervine both being elected.  The PUP supported the Belfast Agreement and in the 1998 election to the Northern Ireland Assembly they also won two seats, with representatives Billy Hutchinson and David Ervine elected from the Belfast North and East constituencies respectively. Hutchinson lost his seat in the 2003 election, leaving Ervine as their sole Assembly representative. This was followed by a poor showing in the Northern Ireland local election of 2005, where Smyth and Ervine were their only two members to retain their seats on local authorities, and the party now seems to be in a state of decline."]}, {"page": "List of political parties in Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Hugh Smyth", "|Hugh Smyth ||23y ||Progressive Unionist Party 1979\u20132002 ||"]}, {"page": "Volunteer Political Party", "response": ["also carried out some limited canvassing on the Catholic Falls Road.Frenett, Ross. \"\u2018Protestant Socialists\u2019?

Ultimately the Council decided not to take any action against McCoubrey, with a motion of censure brought in by the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland's David Alderdice defeated in the council.

According to Sammy Duddy, White's failure to get elected was inevitable as the savage nature of his earlier double murder had even sickened many loyalists and as a result, there was a reluctance to vote for him.Wood, p. 229 However, White was a high-profile figure in the developing tendency of loyalist politics and on 22 July 1996 he was even part of a four-man delegation, along with Gary McMichael, David Ervine and Hugh Smyth, to meet Prime Minister John Major at 10 Downing Street.Taylor, p. 241"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|Hugh Smyth, David Ervine, Billy Hutchinson, William Smith, David Kirk, Patricia Laverty, Dawn Purvis, Edward Kinner, Gusty Spence, Winston Churchill Rea"]}, {"page": "Gusty Spence", "response": ["His funeral service was held in St Michael's Church of Ireland on the Shankill Road.
