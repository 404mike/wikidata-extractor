Latimer scored his first victory on 13 March with Lieutenant James Scaramanga as his observer/gunner, the only one he scored in the Royal Flying Corps. On 1 April 1918, the Army's Royal Flying Corps was merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force. Latimer was then paired with Lieutenant Tom Noel, gaining his second victory on 21 April. Latimer and Noel gained another 13 victories between 8 and 20 May, and on 25 May Latimer was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. Latimer and Noel gained nine more victories in June and July, and in August Latimer and Sergeant Arthur Newland gained five more. However, on 22 August, Latimer was again flying with Noel, when they were shot down by Leutnant Willi Nebgen of Jasta 7. Noel was killed and Latimer captured. Latimer's final total claimed in conjunction with his gunners was one aircraft captured, seventeen destroyed (including one shared), and ten 'out of control' wins (two shared), making him the highest-scoring ace of No. 20 Squadron.", "|1 || 13 March 1918@ 1255 || Bristol F.2b(C4615) || Albatros D.V || Out of control || Comines\u2014Wervicq || Observer: 2nd Lt.
