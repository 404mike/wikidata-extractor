He was a right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler.\nHaving played club cricket for Boughton Hall since 1890, Bretherton made his debut in first-class cricket when he was selected to play for the Liverpool and District cricket team against Yorkshire at Aigburth in 1890. He made five further appearances in first-class cricket for Liverpool and District to 1894, all of which came against Yorkshire, with exception of his second match of 1893 which came against the touring Australians. He scored a total of 165 runs in his six matches, averaged 16.50, with a high score of 50. With the ball he took 24 wickets, which came at an identical average to his batting. His best figures were 5/30 in his debut match, which was also his only career five wicket haul. He later made a single appearance for Cheshire in the 1895 Minor Counties Championship against Worcestershire.He died at Raby, Cheshire on 9 June 1926.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Sayers", "response": ["Sayer's \"Carlo Khan\" has been frequently reproduced. But he can only be judged with confidence after examining the collection in the British Museum, or other public libraries. His drawings, made originally with pencil on oil paper, were etched for him by the Brethertons ((James Bretherton, Charles Bretherton)). They were then sold in collections of the size of a large octavo copybook, under such titles as Illustrious Heads (1794) or Outlines of the Opposition (1795).  Sayer left a complete gallery of small full-length pictures of the public men of his time, slightly caricatured. In his large plates he is inferior to James Gillray, and he never has the grace of Thomas Rowlandson, but he was closer to the truth than either."]}, {"page": "Ernie Robson", "response": ["Robson made his debut for a county side in 1891, representing Cheshire in 'second-class' cricket.'Second-class' cricket was a term often used to describe matches between county sides which did not have first-class status.  Robson batted at number eleven in this match, and was not required to bowl. Cheshire instead opted to rely solely on their opening bowlers, who bowled in excess of 39 overs each in the match against Warwickshire.  He also made two appearances for the Gentlemen of Cheshire in this season, batting as part of the middle order, and opening the bowling on each occasion.  He appeared regularly for Cheshire in 1892 and 1893, gradually bowling more and more overs for the county.  By the end of 1893, he was opening the bowling, and had performed particularly well against Derbyshire, claiming six wickets \u2013 though he was over twice as expensive as opening bowler James Bretherton.  He didn't appear in county cricket in the following 1894 season."]}, {"page": "Bretherton, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Bretherton"]}, {"page": "Bretherton (disambiguation)", "response": ["*James Bretherton (1862-1926), English cricketer"]}]}}
