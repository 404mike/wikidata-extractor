On 18 January 1981 a number of black youths died in a fire during a house party in New Cross, in the nearby Borough of Lewisham. Although authorities stated that the fire started inside and was accidental, the public believed it was an arson attack and criticised the police investigation as inadequate. Black activists, including Darcus Howe, organised a march for the \"Black People's Day of Action\" on 2 March. Accounts of turnout vary from 5,000 to 20,000 to 25,000. The marchers walked 17 miles from Deptford to Hyde Park, passing the Houses of Parliament and Fleet Street. While the majority of the march finished in Hyde Park without incident, there was some confrontation with police at Blackfriars. According to Professor Les Back, \"while the local press reported the march respectfully, the national papers unloaded the full weight of racial stereotyping.\" The Evening Standards front-page headline had displayed a photo of a policeman with a bloody face juxtaposed with Darcus Howe's quote about the march being \"A good day\".  A few weeks later, the police arrested some of the march organizers and charged them with the offence of riot, but were later acquitted."]}, {"page": "2000s in sociology", "response": ["*John Solomos' and Les Back's Theories of Race and Racism; A Reader is published."]}, {"page": "1990s in sociology", "response": ["*Les Back's New Ethnicities and Urban culture is published.", "*John Solomos' and Les Back's Racism and Society is published."]}, {"page": "Beverley Skeggs", "response": ["Skeggs can be heard reflecting on the analysis of her Formations of Class and Gender; Becoming Respectable book.
