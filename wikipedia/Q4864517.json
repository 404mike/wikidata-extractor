Taylor's first signing was Junior Lewis, a  midfielder who joined from non-League club Hendon; he had previously played under Taylor's management at Dover Athletic.  Barry Miller, a defender, also stepped up from non-League football, having last played for Farnborough, and former Port Vale defender Brian McGlinchey also joined the club; both players had been released by their previous clubs at the end of the preceding season but played for Gillingham on a trial basis during pre-season and performed well enough to be offered contracts.  Andy Thomson and Christian Lee, both forwards,  were signed from Oxford United and Northampton Town respectively; Gillingham paid transfer fees of \u00a325,000 for Thomson and \u00a335,000 for Lee.  The club also signed Anthony Williams on loan from Blackburn Rovers to act as back-up for Vince Bartram, the club's first-choice goalkeeper.  The team prepared for the upcoming season with a number of friendly matches against non-League teams.  Writing in The Times, Nick Szczepanik did not tip Gillingham for a top-six finish, stating that the team had \"missed their chance\" following the previous season's play-off final defeat."]}, {"page": "Brentford F.C.
