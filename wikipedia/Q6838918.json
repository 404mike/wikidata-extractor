He went into radio after retiring as a player, and co-hosted Century FM's coverage of Middlesbrough matches with Ali Brownlee from 1996 to 2007. Brownlee tended to be positive and optimistic about Middlesbrough, whereas Slaven would be more critical and realistic. The pair also presented shows for NTL's \"Boro TV\" channel from 1997 until Slaven was sacked in December 2002 after he missed a filming session in protest at the company's habit of failing to pay wages on time. In 1999, Slaven bared his buttocks in Binns department store window in Middlesbrough after telling Brownlee on Century FM that if Middlesbrough beat Manchester United at Old Trafford, he would perform the dare. Middlesbrough ran out 3\u20132 winners, so Slaven had to go ahead with the dare, with the score painted on his cheeks. He went on to recreate the moment on television for They Think It's All Over's \"Feel The Sportsman\" round. He announced his intention to stand for the newly created post of Mayor of Middlesbrough in October 2002, but withdrew from the race before the election as his candidacy was a publicity stunt for Century FM rather than a serious attempt to enter politics. He went on to present Legends Football Phone-In for Real Radio North East and later Koast Radio from 200 to 2014, alongside him were Malcolm Macdonald and Eric Gates who was replaced later by Micky Horswill. He released two autobiographies: Strikingly Different in 1996, and Legend? in 2007."]}, {"page": "Micky", "response": ["* Micky Horswill (born 1953), British professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1973 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|CM ||4 || Micky Horswill"]}, {"page": "Micky Horswell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Micky Horswill"]}, {"page": "Sunderland A.F.C.
