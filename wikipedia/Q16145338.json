Scholars such as Linda Lim and Naila Kabeer argue that the maquila sector has not had a negative effect on women.

In 2004, Kabeer argued that the factory work can build women's self-esteem and independence. In 2010, however, Edme Dominguez et al. argued against the positive portrayal made by Lim and Kabeer. They make the point that gender relations have changed very little since the proliferation of maquiladoras.
