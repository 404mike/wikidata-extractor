Stallybrass was a keen sportsman, although like Heberden he saw it only as a means to an end\u00a0\u2013 albeit a plethora of laudable ends.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0328. Brasenose had a middling income of \u00a324,000 a year, with a similarly average 180 undergraduates.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0338. Religious attendance was relaxed, and fees for returning to college between 9 and 11PM abolished. Brasenose's collegiate link with Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge was established. Staircases XIV and XV were created, the only significant changes to the college buildings; the twenty fellows gradually replaced in Stallybrass' own image.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0338\u2013339. Brasenose went back to the head of the river in 1928, rising from 22nd in 1922. Although Oxford's performance in rowing was poor, Brasenose was central to its few successes against Cambridge.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0343. It would sink to sixth in 1934\u00a0\u2013 although notable among its members was John Gorton, future Prime Minister of Australia.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0344. Success in rowing was matched in rugby and cricket\u00a0\u2013 with Brasenose producing players such as Alexander Obolensky and Ian Smith. Brasenose rugby only reached its peak after the Second World War, with players such as Brian Boobbyer and Philip Moore, Baron Moore of Wolvercote.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0345\u2013346. In cricket, Geoffrey Legge and Greville Stevens were early players; Ian Peebles Gerry Chalk and Roger Kimpton  followed them: between 1934 and 1938 at least five members of the university team came from Brasenose.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0346\u2013347. it may have been Brasenose's attachment to sport that meant it was slow to phase out Pass men.Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0348\u2013349. The effect on academic success was considerable; Brasenose slumped in performance except in law, where it excelled. In the 1930s Brasenose recorded no more than six firsts in a year; a total assisted by seven firsts in 1937\u20131939 in law, out a total of 13 across the university.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0361. The future Lord Scarman (Lord of Appeal in Ordinary) was among undergraduates; two contemporaries and aspiring students, Richard Holdsworth and Michael Peacock were killed in the Second World War.Crook (2008). p.\u00a0375."]}, {"page": "Clarence Buss", "response": ["Buss made a single first-class appearance for Surrey against Oxford University in 1934 at The Oval.

He was educated at Charterhouse School, where he played for the school cricket team for two years. From Charterhouse he went up to Christ Church, Oxford. While studying at Oxford he made his debut in first-class cricket for Oxford University against the Free Foresters at Oxford in 1933. He played just once for the university in 1933, but followed this up with eleven first-class appearances in the following season. The 1934 season started well for Dyson, with him 29 wickets, with best figures of 5 for 54, however he struggled toward the tailend of the season and was dropped by Oxford captain Gerry Chalk. He made two appearances in 1935, but struggled against Lancashire as Cyril Washbrook made 228. He managed to force his way back into the Oxford team in 1936, making eleven first-class appearances and taking 34 wickets at an average of 22.88, with best figures of 6 for 47. Dyson played 25 first-class matches for Oxford, taking 68 wickets his slow left-arm orthodox bowling, at an average of 30.98. He later made a final first-class appearance for the Free Foresters against Oxford University in 1938. He died at Wonford in Exeter in July 1991."]}]}}
