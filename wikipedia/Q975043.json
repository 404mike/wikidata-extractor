On his mother's side he was the grandson of David Wilson the founder of the Great Eastern Hotel in Calcutta. He was born at Swifts Park at Cranbrook in Kent and educated at Radley and Sandhurst.\nAlexander was commissioned in a Militia battalion of the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own), and in October 1900 took up a commission in a regular battalion of that regiment. Promotion to lieutenant followed on 22 January 1902.During 1902 he visited the Gold Coast Colony, where he made an ornithological survey of that colony, and in September that year he left for the Bonin Islands to investigate their avifauna.Lieutenant Alexander was a member of an expedition which travelled across Africa from the Niger to the Nile, exploring the Lake Chad area. Alexander was accompanied by his brother Claud, Captain G. B. Gosling and Portuguese collector Jos\u00e9 Lopes. In February 1904 they set off from the mouth of the Niger, travelling upriver to Lokoja. Claud died in October of enteric fever after making a survey of the Murchison Range. Boyd and Gosling explored the area around Lake Chad. Gosling died in June 1906 at Niangara of blackwater fever. Boyd then followed the River Kibali, reaching the Nile late in the year and returning to England in February 1907. Alexander's account From The Niger to the Nile was published later that year. In 1908 he was awarded the Founder's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society \"for his three years' journey across Africa from the Niger to the Nile.\"He described Willcocks's honeyguide on the basis of a specimen obtained on his 1901 expedition along the Volta river. His enthusiasm for Lake Chad was such that he and his twin brother Robert had an exact replica of Lake Chad made alongside their family home The Swifts at Cranbrook.Alexander and Lopes sailed back to Africa in 1909. They visited Claud's grave at Maifoni in Bornu and then continued to Ouadai. Boyd was killed in a dispute with locals near Nyeri. His body was recovered by French soldiers and buried next to his brother in Maifoni.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Boyd Alexander (1873\u20131910), English ornithologist who made surveys of birds in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and the Bonin Islands"]}, {"page": "List of ornithologists", "response": ["*Boyd Alexander \u2013 England"]}, {"page": "Radley College", "response": ["*Boyd Alexander, the African traveller and ornithologist."]}, {"page": "Cranbrook, Kent", "response": ["* Boyd Alexander, (1873\u20131910), British Army officer, explorer and ornithologist"]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Alexander, B.

Its plumage is similar to that of the house sparrow, and it similarly is sexually dimorphic. The male has a black or greyish-black crown and eyestripe, a grey nape and a small patch of white on the lower forehead. The sides of its head, especially above the eye, are a rich cinnamon colour. The scapulars are white and brown, while the rest of the upperparts are brown, streaked with black and beige. The cheeks and underparts are pale grey, and the throat and chin are marked with a small black bib. The female is grey-brown, with black-streaked wings and breast, and pale grey underparts. It is very similar to the female house sparrow but has a more apparent pale supercilium (stripe over the eye). The juvenile resembles the adult female, but young males are more chestnut from an early age, with a trace of a black bib on the chin. In 1898, ornithologist Boyd Alexander reported that adults begin moulting in early February, and some birds were still in moult by late May."]}, {"page": "Violet Bonham Carter", "response": ["Violet travelled to the Sudan, where her brother Arthur was in the civil service.
