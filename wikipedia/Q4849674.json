He played on, and 'his last match was a tragic end to a great if short career.' The Scottish half-backs, Jimmy Gillespie and Frank Fasson, outplayed Lloyd and Phillips, and prevented the Welsh backline from receiving much ball. Scotland beat Wales 18\u20138, and the Welsh defeat was blamed on the half-backs."]}, {"page": "Bala (name)", "response": ["* Bala Jones (fl. 1901), Wales rugby player"]}]}}
