With the entire back four unavailable, United were forced to draft in Matt Hill and John Egan on emergency loans, but this was not enough to prevent them slipping to their third defeat in four games as they capitulated at Walsall.  Danny Wilson remained keen to find first team experience for the younger members of the squad and as such allowed Seamus Conneely to join Alfreton Town on loan before United returned to winning ways with two goals from Ched Evans being enough to defeat Brentford at Griffin Park.  Unfortunately the Blades failed to take advantage of their game in hand, being held to a draw by Colchester United, before once again allowing a lead to slip as they drew with Tranmere Rovers at Bramall Lane. With the transfer deadline for loans approaching, the Blades' longest serving player and vice-captain Nick Montgomery was allowed to join Millwall until the end of the season due to an absence of first team football, allowing Danny Wilson to bring in winger Michael O'Halloran on loan from Bolton Wanderers.  Meanwhile, on the pitch, United put their recent poor form behind them as they outclassed Notts County 5\u20132 at Meadow Lane, before putting four goals past Chesterfield at Bramall Lane, including a hat\u2013trick from in\u2013form striker Ched Evans.  Despite a low\u2013key team performance, a second Ched Evans penalty in as many games was enough to finish the month with a third straight victory, with the Blades defeating Hartlepool United at Victoria Park."]}, {"page": "\u00d3 Conghalaigh", "response": ["Descendants of the \u00d3 Conghalaigh of Iar Connacht include TG4 presenter Eibhl\u00edn N\u00ed Chonghaile; musicians John Conneely and Johnny \u00d3g Connolly; sportspersons Aislinn Connolly, Joe Connolly, Michael Conneely and Seamus Conneely; Mayors of Galway Catherine Connolly, Martin Connolly and P\u00e1draig Conneely; scribe Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 Conghaile; writers Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 Conghaile (writer) and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Conghaile."]}, {"page": "2012 Sligo Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| Seamus Conneely", "!Seamus Conneely", "|align=\"left\"|29||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Seamus Conneely", "|Seamus Conneely", "|Seamus Conneely"]}, {"page": "2013 FAI Cup Final", "response": ["|  Seamus Conneely "]}, {"page": "2014 President of Ireland's Cup", "response": ["|DF ||29||  Seamus Conneely || "]}, {"page": "Galway United F.C.", "response": ["*  Seamus Conneely", "*  Seamus Conneely"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Accrington Stanley F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Seamus Conneely"]}]}}
