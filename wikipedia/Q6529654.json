He was born in Laisterdyke, Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Bill Kellett, a Bradford engineer, and Sarah Kellett.\nKellett worked in the merchant navy as an engineer and was demobbed in Manchester, where a meeting with Joe Hill led him to consider life as a professional wrestler. During the 1950s he earned between \u00a340 and \u00a350 and was fighting five to six times a week all over the country. In the 1960s Kellett was nominated for the ITV Sports Personality of the Year and was presented to Prince Philip at the Royal Albert Hall in the 1970s.\nIn the 1970s, he could regularly be seen on ITV's Saturday afternoon sports show-case, World of Sport. Although well known for his comic antics he was respected and feared in equal measure by his fellow professionals and was regarded as one of the toughest opponents in the sport. One of his standard tactics was to appear punch-drunk and almost defeated in a match, before suddenly recovering his ability and delivering the decisive move.\nThe money he earned from his wrestling appearances was not considerable and he supplemented his earnings by working a small holding and caf\u00e9 called \"The Terminus\" in Thornton (close to the terminus of Bradford Trolleybus route 7), with his wife Margaret. On two acres behind the house Kellett sometimes bred pigs and once said he kept fifty head of cattle. Although not seen in televised action after the 1970s, he is still fondly remembered as one of its most endearing characters.Kellett died peacefully in his sleep, in Ilkley, two years after he moved to a nursing home, at the age of 86, leaving a widow, Margaret, son Christopher and two grandchildren, Robert and Keeley. His other son, David Barrie, with whom he used to wrestle as a tag partner and who was a popular middleweight wrestler in his own right, had died in 2000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gimmick (professional wrestling)", "response": ["Initiated by English wrestler Les Kellett, wrestlers who fall under this category are Doink The Clown which was majorly portrayed by Matt Osborne until his death in 2013, which inspired others like Scottish comedian and actor Grado, Ring of Honor's Colt Cabana, Santino Marella, James Ellsworth, and Eugene's \"mentally disabled boy\" character, Japanese Wrestlers Stalker Ichikawa, Gran Naniwa, Kuishinbo Kamen and Toru Yano, Charlie Haas during his impersonations run, and WWE's 1990s turkey character Gobbledy Gooker, and rooster character Red Rooster, WCW's Brian Pillman, and Al Snow along with his mannequin prop called \"Head\" which he used as a sidekick companion during segments while addressing the fans. And recently, The New Day pursued a joyous gimmick, giving them a character heavily associated with the fans. Damien Sandow also falls under this category due to his 'stunt double' gimmick in late 2014 where he copied whatever his on-screen mentor The Miz did, due to the latter using a gimmick of an arrogant movie star. R-Truth also influenced his character with some of his comedic activities, such as breaking out a joke, dancing and finding out his opponent to win the 24/7 Championship in a strange and funny way."]}, {"page": "Laisterdyke", "response": ["The wrestler Les Kellett was born in Laisterdyke."]}, {"page": "Kellett (surname)", "response": ["*Les Kellett (1915\u20132002), English professional wrestler"]}]}}
