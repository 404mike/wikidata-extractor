The entry for the reign between \u00c1ed and Donald\u00a0II is corrupt in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, and in this case the Chronicle is at variance with every other king list.On this, note Dumville's comments regarding damnatio memoriae, Dumville, \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\", p. 75; see also Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 117\u2013121. According to the Chronicle, \u00c1ed was followed by Eochaid, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with Giric, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after \u00c1ed and make great claims for him.Anderson, Kings and Kingship, pp. 251\u2013252, 254, 263, 267, 274, 283, and 288. Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although it has been suggested that he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by Alex Woolf and Archie Duncan with Giric's reign.Duncan, pp. 11\u201316; Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 117\u2013121, 137\u2013138, and 320\u2013322.

Robert the Bruce was the eldest; in the past there was some dispute over whether Edward was second, or third behind Nigel, but one recent account has him fourth behind Nigel and Alexander.Michael Penman, Robert the Bruce, King of the Scots His date of birth is unknown, but it was probably not very long after Robert was born in 1274; he was old enough to be fighting in 1307 and to be given an independent command not long after. The Irish medievalist Se\u00e1n Duffy suggests that he was probably fostered in Ireland as a child, likely by the O'Neills of Ulster, while Archie Duncan suggests some period of time spent with the Bissetts of the Glens of Antrim.Duncan, A. A. M., \"The Scots' Invasion of Ireland, 1315\", in R.R. Davies (ed.), The British Isles, 1100-1500. Edinburgh: J. Donald. 1988. pp. 100\u201317. p. 105 This was a common Scottish and Irish cultural practice, and would tie in with, and perhaps explain, parts of his later life."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish monarchs", "response": ["The status of Margaret, Maid of Norway, as a Scottish monarch is debated by historians. One of her biographers, Archie Duncan, argues that because she was \"never inaugurated, she was never queen of Scots\". Another, Norman H. Reid, insists that Margaret was \"accepted as queen\" by her contemporaries but that, owing to the lack of Inauguration, \"[her] reign never started\"."]}, {"page": "Jocelin of Glasgow", "response": ["This kind of literary patronage started while Jocelin was abbot of Melrose. Archie Duncan has shown that it was probably Jocelin who first commissioned the writing of the Chronicle of Melrose. Duncan argued that Jocelin commissioned the entries dealing with the period between 731 and 1170, putting the writing in the hands of a monk named Reinald (who later became Bishop of Ross).Ibid., pp. 149\u2013150. This chronicle is one of the few extant chronicles from \"Scotland\" in this period. G. W. S. Barrow, writing before Duncan advanced these arguments, noted that down to the end of King William's reign \"the chronicle of Melrose Abbey ... represents a strongly 'Anglo-Norman' as opposed to a native Scottish point of view\".G. W. S. Barrow, The Acts of William I, Regesta Regum Scottorum, vol. ii,  (Edinburgh, 1971), p. 7. It is thus possible that this anti-Scottish world-view reflected that of Jocelin's, at least before he left the abbey."]}]}}
