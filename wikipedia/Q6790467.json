According to Wisden editor Matthew Engel, writing in ESPNcricinfo, Botham \"resigned (a minute before being sacked), his form shot to pieces\" after that match. Australia were then leading the series 1\u20130 after two Tests with four more to be played. Botham was replaced by the returning Mike Brearley, who had been his predecessor until retiring from Test cricket in 1980.", "After retiring from cricket, Botham became involved in the media and has worked as an analyst and commentator for Sky Sports for many years. He has earned much respect as a broadcaster because of his deep knowledge and understanding of cricket; he imparts information and opinion objectively, giving praise where it is due and constructive criticism where that is due. Unlike Fred Trueman and others, he does not hark back to \"in my day\". Wisden editor Matthew Engel remarked on Botham's calmness, wit and sagacity as a TV commentator, though admitting he was surprised by it."]}, {"page": "Curtly Ambrose", "response": ["West Indies' loss of form continued in late 1997 when they lost every international match during their tour of Pakistan.Mohammed, pp. 1,094\u201395. Ambrose played in two out of West Indies' three matches in an ODI tournament, taking one wicket, but his performance in taking one wicket in the two Test matches he played\u2014he missed the third match with injury\u2014prompted Fazeer Mohammed, writing in Wisden, to describe Ambrose as \"a shadow of his former self\". Any danger that Ambrose might have retired after this series was forestalled when Brian Lara was appointed West Indies captain and immediately spoke to Ambrose and Walsh to ask them to continue in the team.Berry, p. 1,023. When England toured the West Indies between January and April 1998, he took 30 wickets at 14.26 to top the bowling averages for the series.Berry (1999), p. 1,027. Many of the pitches during the tour were poor for batting, but Ambrose was very effective, particularly in the second, third and fourth Tests. In addition, he dismissed Mike Atherton, the England captain, six times in the series. Scyld Berry wrote in Wisden that Ambrose was \"back to something near his peak form\u00a0... [He] defied every prediction that he was finished after his tour of Pakistan.\" In the second Test, Ambrose took eight wickets; he conceded only 23 runs from 26 overs in the first innings and bowled a spell of five wickets for 16 runs from 47 deliveries in the second to complete figures of five for 52.Marks, Vic in Berry (1999), pp. 1,034\u201335. Having won the second match, West Indies lost the third, but according to Matthew Engel, \"Ambrose's abiding power was the most constant feature of a fluctuating match\".Engel, Matthew in Berry (1999), pp. 1,037\u201338. His eight wickets in the game, including five for 25 in the first innings, took him past fifty Test wickets in Trinidad. He followed up with six wickets in West Indies victory in the fourth Test, taking four for 38 in the final innings. Tony Cozier wrote that Ambrose \"thundered in, arms and knees pumping like pistons, to generate all of his old pace.\"Cozier, Tony in Berry (1998), pp. 1,041\u201342. Following the Test series, which West Indies won 3\u20131, Ambrose played in the first three matches of the ODI series,Berry (1999), pp. 1,048\u201352. and took three wickets.", "Ambrose and Walsh missed the Mini World Cup ODI tournament in October 1998,Cozier (2000), p. 1,329. in Ambrose's case following damage to his house caused by Hurricane Georges. They returned to the team for West Indies' first ever tour of South Africa, and Ambrose took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 23.76, but West Indies lost every game of the five-match series.Dean, pp. 1,160\u201361. In the first Test match, Ambrose and Walsh bowled effectively but lacked support from the other members of the attack.Dean, pp. 1,162\u201363. In the second Test, the pair again lacked support, but bowled well. The visiting team generally bowled too many bouncers to be effective, but Ambrose took eight wickets in the game, including six for 51 in the second innings.Dean, pp. 1,164\u201365. He was ineffective in the third Test,Dean, p. 1,167. and despite bowling what Geoffrey Dean in Wisden called a \"superb opening spell\", could not prevent South Africa building up a large total against an attack lacking two other main bowlers. Ambrose pulled out of the attack himself later in the innings with a back injury, and did not bowl in the second innings.Dean, pp. 1,168\u201369. He missed the final Test with a hamstring injury.Dean, p. 1,171. He was fit to play in the first six games of a seven-match ODI series, won 6\u20131 by South Africa, and took six wickets.Dean, pp. 1,172\u201377. In March 1999, West Indies then faced Australia in a home series, and contrary to expectations, West Indies drew the series 2\u20132. The outcome of the series was decided by a small group of players, including Ambrose, whom Mike Coward described in Wisden as \"five of the most distinguished cricketers of all time\".Coward, pp. 1,218\u201319. Ambrose took 19 wickets at 22.26, second to Walsh in the averages.Coward, p. 1,221. His best figures came in the fourth and final Test, when he took five for 94 in the first innings and eight wickets in the match,Coward, pp. 1,230\u201331. but in the third match, although he only took four wickets in total, Coward described Ambrose as \"rampant\" and wrote that Steve Waugh, who scored 199, had to survive \"some extraordinary pace bowling from Ambrose\".Coward, pp. 1,227\u201329. He played four of the ODIs which followed in April, taking three wickets. The following month, Ambrose took part in the 1999 World Cup in England, and he was the second most economical bowler in the tournament in conceding an average 2.35 runs per over while taking seven wickets at 13.42. West Indies went out in the group stages, and Matthew Engel suggested that the bowlers were tired and judged the team \"outright failures\"."]}, {"page": "News of the World", "response": ["Before long, the News of the World established itself as the most widely read Sunday paper, with initial sales of around 12,000 copies a week. Sales then suffered because the price was not cut following the abolition of newspaper taxes and the paper was soon no longer among the leading Sunday titles, selling around 30,000 by 1880, a greater number but a smaller proportion, as newspaper sales had grown hugely. The title was sold by the Bell family in 1891 to Henry Lascelles Carr who owned the Welsh Western Mail. As editor, he installed his nephew Emsley Carr, who held the post for 50 years. The real engine of the paper's now quick commercial success, however, was George Riddell, who reorganised its national distribution using local agents. Matthew Engel, in his book Tickle the Public: One Hundred Years of the Popular Press (Gollancz, 1996), says that the News of the World of the 1890s was \"a very fine paper indeed\".

All that has changed under Ganguly, perhaps for the better.\" He credits Ganguly for not being shy of taking on responsibility. \"He showed that he can be a leader of a team, which has greats like Sachin and Dravid in the side, without any problems. Under Ganguly's leadership, India started winning matches and tournaments, previously lacking from the team considerably.\" Within a few years of his captaincy, Ganguly rewrote the rules of being a captain of a cricket team. Unlike some of his predecessors, Ganguly was considered impartial, non-parochial, and forever pushed his players to perform better. Off the field, his interactions with the media, his fans, and detractors were uncompromisingly honest and earned him the respect of cricket followers everywhere. However, along with this respect came the criticisms. Ganguly was condemned as a hot-tempered man who refused to listen to other's opinions and abided by his own rules and regulations. Matthew Engel, ICC sport critic, noted that this \"turning deaf\" to other's opinions would one day harm Ganguly and that it was sheer luck that he existed on the sporting world."]}, {"page": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["*Matthew Engel and Andrew Radd, The History of Northamptonshire CCC (County Cricket History), Christopher Helm Publishers Ltd, 1993, "]}, {"page": "Horatio Bottomley", "response": ["Among Bottomley's principal biographers, Hyman suggests that his financial fecklessness and disregard for consequences may have originated from his deprived background and sudden acquisition of wealth in the 1890s. \"Success went to his head and he started spending money like a drunken sailor and could never break the habit.\" It was a wonder, says Hyman, that he stayed out of prison as long as he did.Hyman, pp. 291\u201392 G.

The editor of Wisden at the time, Matthew Engel, wrote that the only real deficiency of the list was the absence of a fast bowler in the top five places. Fast bowlers dominated cricket from the 1970s until at least the mid-1990s, and the most famous pre-war test series, Bodyline, aroused controversy because of England's fast bowling strategy designed to counter Bradman. The Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee was joint sixth in the overall list, selected by 19 of the panellists. The only specialist bowler in the top five is Shane Warne, who was a leg spinner.
