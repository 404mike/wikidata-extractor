He was Bishop of Arichat from September 22, 1844 (later the name changed to  Diocese of Antigonish). The difference in the dates is due to the splitting of the diocese into two dioceses effective September 22, 1844, and Fraser remaining Bishop of Halifax until such time that William Walsh took formal possession of the diocese of Halifax.", "link_mentions": {}}}
