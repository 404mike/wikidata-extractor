They give a highly idealised depiction of the forms represented, and the compositions, though very carefully conceived in drawings, achieve \"sprezzatura\", a term invented by his friend Castiglione, who defined it as \"a certain nonchalance which conceals all artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effortless ...\".Book of the Courtier 1:26 The whole passage  According to Michael Levey, \"Raphael gives his [figures] a superhuman clarity and grace in a universe of Euclidian certainties\".Levey, Michael; Early Renaissance, p. 197 ,1967, Penguin The painting is nearly all of the highest quality in the first two rooms, but the later compositions in the Stanze, especially those involving dramatic action, are not entirely as successful either in conception or their execution by the workshop."]}, {"page": "Francesco Zuccarelli", "response": ["Despite the fame he experienced in his lifetime, Zuccarelli's reputation declined in the early 19th century with naturalism becoming increasingly favoured in landscapes. Turner criticized him in mild terms while confessing that his figures could be beautiful, paving the way for more severe Victorian assessments. In 1959, the art historian Michael Levey offered suggestions for why Zuccarelli held such wide contemporary appeal among the English, concluding that his best work is highly decorative. More recently, since the 1990s there has been a renewed focus on Zuccarelli among Italian scholars, who have given him prominence in several books and articles, and his paintings and drawings are regularly shown in exhibitions.", "Zuccarelli was one of the few Venetian painters of his era to win universal acclaim, even from critics who rejected the concept of Arcadia. He was especially popular among the followers of Rousseau. Francesco Maria Tassi (1716\u20131782), in his Lives of the Painters, Sculptors, and Architects of Bergamo remarks that Zuccarelli paints \"landscapes with the most charming figures and thus excels not only artists of modern times but rivals the great geniuses of the past; for no one previously knew how to combine the delights of an harmonious ground with figures gracefully posed and represented in the most natural colours\". With the move to more representational modes of depicting landscape in the 19th century, negative criticism began to develop, as described by the art historian Michael Levey in a landmark 1959 article, Francesco Zuccarelli in England: Turner's view was restrained, saying Zuccarelli's work was \"meretricious\", lacking the charm and grace of Watteau, and yet his figures were \"sometimes beautiful\". Victorian writers, among them partisans of Richard Wilson, sensitive to the neglect of their favourite while the Italian flourished, used adjectives such as theatrical and insincere. Levey contributed to a reevaluation of the artist by explaining the appeal of Zuccarelli to his contemporaries, drawing a parallel with the affection of the 18th century English for pastoral poetry, since everyone could recognize a pleasing convention when they saw one; in this case, a fairyland where \"the skies are forever blue, the trees forever green.\" The exaltation of the rural life as a retreat from the bustle of urbanity had the sanction of a long and distinguished history; for \"Virgil had recommended it, Petrarch had practiced it; Zuccarelli was left to illustrate it\"; and in Levey's continuation, \"at its best\u2014in comparison to an age he never saw\u2014Zuccarelli's work is highly decorative and still capable of giving pleasure\". While sparsely treated in Italy for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the painter never fell into disfavour there as in England. The last few decades have seen a resurgence of interest in Zuccarelli by Italian scholars, notably by Federico Dal Forno, who published an artistic biography with sixty paintings in 1994, and Federica Spadotto, who issued a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 in 2007. In a larger cultural context, modern historians have considered him to be a figure of interest with his love of escapism, seen as not untypical of the late Baroque."]}, {"page": "Sandro Botticelli", "response": ["Walter Pater created a literary picture of Botticelli, who was then taken up by the Aesthetic movement.

He fell in love first with Sally, then transferred his affections onto her sister Maria, then broke with Maria and turned to Sally again. Both the sisters had fragile health; Maria died in 1798, on her deathbed extracting a promise from her sister never to marry Lawrence. Sally kept her promise and refused to see Lawrence again, dying in 1803. However Lawrence continued on friendly terms with their mother and painted several portraits of her. He never married. In later years two women would provide him with companionship, friends Elizabeth Croft and Isabella Wolff who first met Lawrence when she sat for her portrait in 1803. Isabella was married to the Danish consul Jens Wolff, but she separated from him in 1810, and Sir Michael Levey suggests that people may have wondered if Lawrence was the father of her son Herman.Levey 2005: 194, 263", "Lawrence's friends asked the Scottish poet Thomas Campbell to write the artist's biography, but he passed the task on to D.E. Williams whose two rather inaccurate volumes were published in 1831.Levey 2005: 302\u20133 It would be nearly 70 years later, in 1900, before another biography of Lawrence appeared, this time by Lord Ronald Gower. In 1913 Sir Walter Armstrong, who was not a great admirer of Lawrence, published a monograph. The 1950s saw the publication of two further works: Douglas Goldring's Regency portrait painter, and Kenneth Garlick's catalogue of Lawrence's paintings (a further edition was published in 1989). Sir Michael Levey, curator of the National Portrait Gallery's 1979\u201380 Lawrence exhibition, produced books on the artist in 1979 and 2005. Lawrence's entanglements with the Siddons family has been the subject of three books (by Oswald Knapp, Andr\u00e9 Maurois, and Naomi Royde-Smith) and a recent radio play.", "Lawrence's reputation as an artist fell during the Victorian era. Critic and artist Roger Fry did something to restore it in the 1930s, when he described Lawrence as having a \"consummate mastery over the means of artistic expression\" with an \"unerring hand and eye\".Roger Fry (Reflections on British Painting, 1934) quoted in Levey 2005: 309 At one time Lawrence was more popular in the United States and France than he was in Britain, and some of his best known portraits, including those of Elizabeth Farren, Sarah Barrett Moulton (known to her family as Pinkie), and Charles Lambton (the \"Red Boy\") found their way to the United States during the early 20th century enthusiasm there for English portraits. Sir Michael Levey acknowledges that Lawrence is still dismissed by some art historians; his explanation is that \"He was a highly original artist, quite unexpected on the English scene: self-taught, self-absorbed in perfecting his own personal style, and in effect self-destructing, since he left behind no significant followers or creative influence. Leaving aside Sargent, his sole successor has been not in painting, but in fashionable, virtuoso photography.\"Levey 2005: 312\u201313"]}, {"page": "National Gallery", "response": ["Unlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. It came into being when the British government bought 38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein in 1824. After that initial purchase, the Gallery was shaped mainly by its early directors, especially Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations, which now account for two-thirds of the collection.

Despite their elevated subject matter, they are bright in colour, and light-hearted in mood: Michael Levey describes the paintings at the palace  as \"a shimmering set of tableaux, full of wit and elegance\". Tiepolo used a much cooler palette than previous Venetian painters, in order to create a convincing effect of daylight.  His first masterpieces in Venice were a cycle of ten enormous canvases painted to decorate a large reception room of Ca' Dolfin on the Grand Canal of Venice (ca. 1726\u20131729), depicting  battles and triumphs from the history of ancient Rome."]}, {"page": "Luca Giordano", "response": ["Giordano has been criticized as being a prolific trader of all styles, and master of none.

Sir Michael Levey once noted that Watteau \"created, unwittingly, the concept of the individualistic artist loyal to himself, and himself alone\". If his immediate followers, Lancret and Pater, would depict the unabashed frillery of aristocratic romantic pursuits, Watteau in a few masterpieces anticipates an art about art, the world of art as seen through the eyes of an artist. In contrast to the Rococo whimsicality and licentiousness cultivated by Boucher and Fragonard in the later part of Louis XV's reign, Watteau's theatrical panache is usually tinged with a note of sympathy, wistfulness, and sadness at the transience of love and other earthly delights. Famously, the Victorian essayist Walter Pater wrote of Watteau: \"He was always a seeker after something in the world, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all.\""]}, {"page": "Brigid Brophy", "response": ["She married art historian Michael Levey in 1954.

In 1954 Brophy married art historian Michael Levey (afterwards director of the British National Gallery, 1973\u201387, and knighted in 1981) and the couple had one daughter, Kate (b. 1957). Her marriage was very happy even though Brophy wrote of the \"immorality of marriage\" and said British society had \"imposed monogamy on those who have not chosen it\". After homosexuality was legalised in Britain in 1967, Brophy was one of the first to demand gay marriage, at the time a controversial stance to take.

Some have claimed Lancret's work is significantly inferior to that of Watteau. In drawing and in painting his touch is often considered intelligent but dry; art historian Michael Levey remarked that Lancret was 'no poet but a charming essayist'.
