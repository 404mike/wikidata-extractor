Flamson was born and died at Heather, Leicestershire.\nFlamson was a right-arm medium-fast bowler and a right-handed tail-end batsman. He appeared in a couple of first-class matches in the 1934 season but made little impression, and did not return until 1937 when he was taken on to the Leicestershire full-time staff, and won praise from Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. In what it termed one of Leicestershire's worst ever seasons, it wrote, \"probably the only satisfactory feature of the bowling was the advance of Flamson, who in his first full season of county cricket, accomplished some splendid performances\". It went on: \"He developed as the season progressed and towards the close often carried the attack on his shoulders. Powerfully built and with a run-up similar to that of George Geary, he put plenty of 'shoulder' into his medium-fast deliveries and had the knack of making the ball keep unexpectedly low.\"Flamson took 60 wickets in 19 matches in 1937 at the high average of 33.78 runs per wicket. Against Nottinghamshire in his second match of the season he took seven first innings wickets for 46 runs and these remained the best figures of his career. He achieved his best match figures in Leicestershire's only victory of the season, the game against Hampshire, when he took six for 61 and three for 51 to finish with nine for 112 in the game.Flamson was still a regular member of the side though he took fewer wickets in 1938 \u2013 53 wickets in the season at the lower average of 27.41 \u2013 and he missed a month of the season through injury. His one innings of note as a batsman was in this season: he made an unbeaten 50 in half an hour in the game against Northamptonshire. In 1939, in an unsuccessful team that finished at the bottom of the County Championship, Flamson was himself not successful, taking 36 wickets at the very high average of 38.16. He lost his place in the team at the start of July, though he returned for a single match towards the end of August which proved to be the last match of his first-class cricket career.\nHe died at the age of 40 in January 1945, before first-class cricket had resumed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael England", "response": ["Born at Midgham, Berkshire, England, was educated at Eton College, where he was in the Eton XI in 1936 and 1937.  It was in 1936 that he made his debut for Berkshire in the Minor Counties Championship against Hertfordshire, though his schooling commitments limited him to one appearance each in 1936 and 1937.  He later attended Magdalen College, Oxford, while studying there he made his first-class debut for Oxford University Cricket Club against Leicestershire in 1938.  In this match, he scored 11 runs in Oxford University's first-innings, before being dismissed by William Flamson, while in their second-innings he wasn't required to bat.  In Leicestershire's first-innings, he took 2 catches behind the stumps, with the match ending in a draw.  He made a second first-class appearance for the university the following season against the Minor Counties.  He scored 5 runs in Oxford University's first-innings, before being dismissed by Francis Appleyard, while in their second-innings he scored 43 not out.  He also took a further two catches behind the stumps, with the match ending in a Minor Counties victory by 4 wickets.  His appearances in the team were limited due to the number of wicket-keepers that were used by Oxford University during this time, such as Robin Whetherly, Hector Jelf, Peter Blagg and Manning Clark."]}, {"page": "Flamson", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Flamson"]}, {"page": "James Sperry", "response": ["The Leicestershire club that Sperry returned to in 1946 after the Second World War was a rather different side from that of 1939: other seam bowlers such as William Flamson and Haydon Smith were either dead or retired, and the attack centred on the spin bowling of Jack Walsh and Vic Jackson. Sperry played regularly in the first six post-war seasons as often the only regular seam bowler, sometimes having Jackson's off-breaks as the other opening bowler. His best return was in the 1948 season, when he took 81 wickets in all matches at an average of 23.55; his average was better in 1951, when his 62 wickets cost just 22.70, but in some other seasons he averaged more than 33 runs per wicket, high for a regular bowler in the period in which he played. He retired at the age of 41 after the 1951 season but returned for two games in 1952 when he was granted a benefit match by Leicestershire."]}, {"page": "Flamson, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Flamson"]}]}}
