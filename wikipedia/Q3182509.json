He adopted the name \"Stax\" because of his fondness for the music produced by Stax Records.He played on all of their charting singles, which included \"Rosalyn,\" \"Don't Bring Me Down,\" \"Road Runner,\" and \"Cry to Me.\" He also frequently  contributed backing vocals as well as harmonica performance. He played on the Pretty Things' first three albums: The Pretty Things, Get the Picture? and Emotions, although his exact contributions to the latter are unknown.  He also played on the band's first two EPs, The Pretty Things and Rainin' in My Heart. Stax left the band in January 1967, a month after rhythm guitarist Brian Pendleton. Stax emigrated to Australia in 1970 where he currently resides.\nStax currently builds and sells cigar box guitars. He rejoined the Pretty Things on their 2012 Australian tour, taking the stage on a couple of songs to play bass guitar and harmonica.\nStax also played with Melbourne R&B 'supergroup' Blues Hangover, which featured Dave Hogan (vocals, harp), Warren Rough (guitar) and Ken Farmer (drums; all from The Paramount Trio) plus Peter Wells (Rose Tattoo) and Lucy De Soto. The band's passionate, gritty brand of R&B; was heard to good effect on two albums issued on the Dog Meat label, Blues Hangover (1995) and Roadrunner (1996).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pretty Things", "response": ["The Pretty Things were preceded by Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys, which consisted of Dick Taylor, fellow Sidcup Art College student Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger, among others. When Brian Jones was recruiting for his own band, all three joined Brian and Ian Stewart and were dubbed \"Rollin' Stones\" by Jones in June 1962. Because there were too many guitar players in the band, Taylor switched to bass. He quit the Stones five months later, when he was accepted at the Central School of Art and Design in London. Phil May, another Sidcup student, convinced him to form a new band. Taylor was once again playing guitar, with May singing and playing harmonica. They recruited John Stax on bass, Brian Pendleton on rhythm guitar, and Pete Kitley on drums. Kitley was soon replaced by Viv Andrews, also known as Viv Broughton.\"The Pretty Things / Philippe de Barge acetate 1968\", Willy-rock.blogspot.co.uk, 27 September 2009.", "In 2012, the band returned to New Zealand for the first time since the bad publicity of 1965.

Frontman Phil May called upon a childhood friend Wally Waller, whose band, the Fenmen, had recently split, to help record the rest of the album. In the event, Waller took over the bass duties and brought in the Fenmen's drummer, Jon Povey, who was also a keyboardist.

It ended up being a haphazard affair thanks to a growing problem with drummer Viv Prince whose behaviour was becoming ever more erratic and reckless. With Prince being unreliable, the band had help in the form of producer Bobby Graham who was a renowned drummer in his own right, playing on several tracks. John Stax's flatmate John C. Alder helped out on at least two tracks, one of which was \"You'll Never Do It Baby\". Jimmy Page, then a prominent session musician, was occasionally involved in the recordings, receiving a partial writing credit on \"You Don't Believe Me.\" The album did see the band starting to move away from the staunch R&B direction that dominated the first album, exploring more soulful areas as well as Freakbeat with much use of distortion on guitar and bass parts.", "# \"Get a Buzz\" (May, Taylor, Brian Pendleton, John Stax, Skip Alan)\u2013 4:02", "*John Stax \u2013 bass, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "The Pretty Things (album)", "response": ["#\"13 Chester Street\" (Phil May, Dick Taylor, Brian Pendleton, John Stax, Vivian Prince) \u2013 2:22", "* John Stax \u2013 bass guitar, harmonica, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Rainin' in My Heart", "response": ["* John Stax \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals on \"Sittin' All Alone\""]}, {"page": "Viv Prince", "response": ["thumb|The Pretty Things in 1965 (left to right): Brian Pendleton, John Stax, Dick Taylor, Phil May, Viv Prince"]}, {"page": "Wally Waller", "response": ["In the early months of 1967, Wally Waller joined Pretty Things as a bass player, replacing John Stax.
