He also had a short spell with Bristol Rovers before finishing his football career in 1994 after three seasons at Dulwich Hamlet. In retirement he owned  a building company ICS Builders in the Croydon area, and managed Chipstead during the 2003\u201304 season.At the start of 2005\u201306 season onwards, he made a return to Palace, in the hospitality department, hosting the executive boxes at Selhurst Park on matchdays. In 2005, Cannon was voted into Palace's Centenary XI, and was only just pipped to \"The Player of The Century\" award by Ian Wright.

He started in the first four matches of the season. However, Speroni missed one match, due to a throat injury. He made his return to the starting line\u2013up against Manchester City in the second round of the League Cup, losing 2\u20130. Despite the loss, Speroni's performance was praised by Your Local Guardian, saying: \"His kicking was a bit off but the defence looked a lot more secure with him behind them\" and named him Man of the Match. He then helped the club keep three consecutive clean sheets between 19 September 2009 and 29 September 2009. Following this, he continued to establish himself as the club's first choice goalkeeper and, once again, his performance drew praise. This includes an impressive performance against Queens Parks Rangers, which manager Warnock praised Speroni's performance, saying: \"He's the best keeper in this division by a mile, and I don't see anyone better in the Premier League. It's good that nobody rates him. But he's not leaving this club while I'm manager - unless I take him somewhere with me.\" Speroni's performance, once again, was praised against Middlesbrough in the follow\u2013up match when he \"world class and claimed everything in his box in a commanding display\" and kept a clean sheet. Halfway through the 2009\u201310 season, Crystal Palace entered administration during the January 2010 transfer window, and the consequent ten-point deduction left the team in danger of relegation, just Speroni experienced this situation once again like his time at Dundee. He continued to maintain his impressive display in a number of matches towards the end of the 2009\u201310 season despite the club's poor results that saw them in relegation zone. His performance was praised by manager Paul Hart, who replaced Warnock halfway through the season, in a match against Blackpool on 20 March 2010. In a match against Sheffield Wednesday on the last game of the season, which Crystal Palace needed a point to survive at their hosts' expense, Speroni started the whole game and despite conceding two goals, he helped the club draw 2\u20132, resulting in the opposition team relegated and the team staying up. At the end of the 2009\u201310 season, Speroni went on to make thirty\u2013two appearances in all competitions. For his performance, he was given a new record, becoming the first man to win Crystal Palace's \"Player of the Year\" award for three consecutive years, equalling Jim Cannon's record, as well as, vice president's player of the year.

Arthur Wait, having overseen the rise of the club from the Fourth to the First Division, was replaced as chairman by Raymond Bloye in November 1972, and the club also appointed Malcolm Allison as the new manager in March the following year, replacing Bert Head. Although the club saw a record average attendance over the season, neither the crowd nor the managerial change were able to keep them at the top level. Allison's first game in charge at home against Chelsea did see some changes, however, including the debut of young Scottish defender Jim Cannon. Palace had never won a London derby in the top division up to this point, but Cannon, who had come through the youth ranks, marked the Chelsea striker Peter Osgood out of the game and then scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 win to begin a long career with the club.Matthews, pp.121\u2013122, 139\u2013140"]}, {"page": "Garda ar L\u00e1r", "response": ["The fourth programme of the second season examined the case of Garda Michael Clerkin and was broadcast on 9 February 2009. On the night of 16 October 1976, Garda\u00ed were deliberately lured to an isolated abandoned farmhouse in County Laois. The house had been booby trapped with explosives, and 24-year-old Garda Michael Clerkin, from Monaghan and only four years in the force, was killed. Detective Tom Peters was also seriously injured and left both deaf and blind, whilst colleagues Jim Cannon, Ben Thornton and Gerry Bohan survived the attack unscathed. It occurred just after President Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh signed the Emergency Powers Bill into law, which during turbulent times aimed to increase the period of detention without charge from two to seven days. Garda\u00ed in Portlaoise received an anonymous phone call stating that subversive activity was ongoing at a disused house at Garryhinch, with a plot to kill local Fine Gael TD Oliver J. Flanagan. Portlaoise phoned the local Portarlington Station, just three miles from Garryhinch and Sergeant Jim Cannon was advised to go to the disused house. Cannon brought two uniformed Garda\u00ed with him, Gerry Bohan and Michael Clerkin, and the two joined forces with Detectives Tom Peters and Ben Thornton on the way. Clerkin used an open rear window to enter the house, opening the front door from the inside to let the others in, triggering the booby trap and killing himself instantaneously. The house had to be demolished in the aftermath.
