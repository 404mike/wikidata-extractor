He spent the whole of the 2017\u201318 season at Macclesfield and helped them to win the National League title.

He scored his first goal for the club on 5 October, levelling the scores in what finished as a 3\u20131 win over Morecambe at Vale Park. In February 2020, it was announced that Joyce had triggered a clause in his contract to keep him at the club until summer 2021. He scored one goal in 43 appearances throughout the 2019\u201320 season, missing just one league game due to suspension, providing the defensive cover in the holding midfield role to allow players such as Scott Burgess, Jake Taylor and Tom Conlon to get further forward. He was a joint winner of that season's Players' Player of the Year award, along with David Worrall."]}, {"page": "Will Atkinson", "response": ["On 4 October 2019, Atkinson signed a short-term deal with Port Vale, 12 years after he briefly played for the club on loan. He was signed by manager John Askey following injuries to Tom Conlon and Manny Oyeleke, leaving him to compete with Luke Joyce, Jake Taylor, Scott Burgess and Ryan Lloyd for a place in central midfield. He was up to match fitness after having spent a full pre-season training with Doncaster Rovers. He made his \"second debut\" for the club the following day, playing at right-back in a 3\u20131 home win over Morecambe, and in doing so set a club record for the longest time between appearances as his previous game for the club came 11 years and 11 months earlier. He scored his first goal for the club on 22 October, when his injury-time strike secured a 2\u20131 victory over former club Bradford City at Valley Parade. In January 2020, he signed an extended deal to keep him at the club until the end of the 2019\u201320 season.

Coming into the club were goalkeeper Jonny Maddison; defenders Adam Crookes, Kieran Kennedy and Shaun Brisley; midfielders Scott Burgess, Ryan Lloyd, Callum Evans, Alex Hurst and Jake Taylor (on loan); wingers David Amoo and Rhys Browne; and strikers Mark Cullen, Richie Bennett and Jordan McFarlane-Archer. He was again nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month, with the EFL writing that \"Slow and steady has been Vale's progress under Askey's astute management this season. Their consistency in February - three wins, three draws and 12 goals from six games - finally lifted his side into the play-off positions.\" However the club were one place outside the play-offs when the season was called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England."]}, {"page": "Danny Whitehead", "response": ["On 3 August 2020, Whitehead cancelled the last year of his contract with Salford and signed a two-year deal with League Two rivals Port Vale.

Though the budget was reduced he aimed to have a smaller and more competitive squad. His first summer signing was midfielder Scott Burgess, released from Bury despite an impressive loan spell at York City; the 21-year-old had previously played on loan at Macclesfield Town in Askey's National League title winning season. He next signed Adam Crookes, a 21-year-old defender who had been released by Nottingham Forest despite impressing whilst on loan at Vale in the second half of the 2018\u201319 season. He then signed 25-year-old Kieran Kennedy, \"a footballing centre-half\" who turned down a new deal at Wrexham in order to return to the English Football League. Big target man striker Richie Bennett then joined, having been let go by Carlisle United. The signings of 27-year-old former Blackpool striker Mark Cullen and 25-year-old former youth-team midfielder Ryan Lloyd were confirmed on 26 June. On 8 July, winger David Amoo arrived on a one-year deal after rejecting a new contract with Cambridge United; this was the first signing to meet Askey's priorities of bringing in a winger, a right-back and a backup goalkeeper. Askey also evaluated five trialists in pre-season friendlies: 19-year-old Bradford (Park Avenue) midfielder Alex Hurst, former Darlington goalkeeper Jonny Maddison, former Millwall and Reading right-back Shaun Cummings, former Yeovil Town winger Rhys Browne and former Coventry City striker Kwame Thomas. Cummings left without a contract as Askey instead again signed another of his former Macclesfield Town players, 23-year-old Callum Evans, who \u2013 like Lloyd \u2013 had been released by Macclesfield boss Sol Campbell. Bookmakers predicted a mid-table finish for the club. The club kit was reverted to Erre\u00e0 manufacturers and the shirt sponsors were revealed as Synectics Solutions, the company owned by chairpersons Carol and Kevin Shanahan. The black and gold away kit was launched in tribute to the protestors who helped to oust Smurthwaite. As pre-season drew to a close the club took a week long trip to Scotland. Trialist winger Rhys Browne, yet another former Macclesfield player, became the ninth summer signing on the day of the club's final pre-season friendly. Signing number ten was the new back-up goalkeeper, 24-year-old Jonny Maddison, who had impressed on trial. A third of the five trialists was also signed, though Alex Hurst was immediately loaned back to Bradford (Park Avenue) in order to gain match experience.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||20||align=\"left\"| Scott Burgess", "|8||MF||||20||Scott Burgess||3||0||0||1||4", "|20||||MF||Scott Burgess||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0", "|align=\"center\"| Young Player of the Year ||align=\"center\"| Scott Burgess", "| 1 July 2019 || CM ||  || Scott Burgess ||  Bury  || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Bury F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2019 || CM ||  || Scott Burgess ||  Port Vale || Free transfer || "]}]}}
