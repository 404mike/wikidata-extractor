In 1915, its population was around 6,500. Following the surrender of the garrison on 29 April 1916, the survivors of the siege were marched to imprisonment at Aleppo, during which many died.Peter Mansfield, The British Empire magazine, Time-Life Books, vol 75, p. 2078 Historian Christopher Catherwood has called the siege \"the worst defeat of the Allies in World War I\".

Cuza served mainly as a catalyst for his nationalism and antisemitism.\" As he himself later acknowledged, the young activist was also deeply influenced by the physiologist and antisemitic ideologue Nicolae Paulescu, who was involved with Cuza's movement.Final Report, p.35, 44, 45", "*Christopher Catherwood, Why the Nations Rage: Killing in the Name of God, Rowman & Littlefield, Lanham, 2002.
