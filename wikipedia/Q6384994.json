Their 20th game of the season was a memorable one. They travelled to Anfield to face Liverpool, and managed to hold the home side to a 2\u20132 draw just over three months after they had crushed Swindon 5\u20130 at the County Ground. Midfielder John Moncur had put Swindon 1\u20130 up on the hour, and although Liverpool equalised after 71 minutes, Swindon restored their lead three minutes later with a goal from Keith Scott. They were still ahead with five minutes remaining, before an 86th-minute equaliser from Liverpool's Mark Wright denied Swindon a famous victory. Swindon won their next game 2\u20131 at home to Southampton. They held Sheffield Wednesday to a thrilling 3\u20133 draw at Hillsborough on 29 December with two goals from striker Craig Maskell. However, after the turn of the new year, Swindon found themselves on the receiving end of some more heavy defeats. On 15 January, they lost 6\u20132 to Everton at Goodison Park, though they did manage a narrow victory over Tottenham Hotspur in their next game, and within a month had fallen to a 5\u20130 defeat at Aston Villa. They were then crushed 7\u20131 at Newcastle on 12 March. A 2\u20132 home draw with Manchester United on 19 March sparked fresh hope that Swindon might just about climb to safety, but they collected just two points from their final eight games and were firmly rooted in bottom place. They had won just five league games all season and conceded 100 goals. Although a string of teams have since recorded fewer wins and points in the Premier League, none have yet matched Swindon\u2019s record for conceding the most goals."]}, {"page": "Windsor F.C.", "response": ["The following season chairman Kevin Stott made the decision to remove the playing budget for the foreseeable future, stating \"the club had already lost its way\". The decision was made after Stott attended the 2012 London Olympic Games and was humbled by the determination and passion of the Olympians. Stott decided that the focus had to be shifted from paying players to win games at grass-roots level to inspiring youth to be determined to win through passion and loyalty. With the budget removed the manager Keith Scott, his assistant Jim Melvin and the playing squad were offered the chance to stay and play under the new terms or move on. The management and the majority of the squad moved on, their last game together being the First Qualifying Round for the FA Cup against Didcot Town, after the club had made its debut in the competition starting in the Extra Preliminary Qualification Round. Mick Woodham stepped into the management void and began to build a squad. After steadying the ship Woodham's young squad finished 8th in the table. The following season Woodham's boys finished in the top six and won Windsor F.C.'s first ever trophy, beating Reading Town 3\u20130 at Chesham United to lift the Berks & Bucks Senior Trophy. In season 2014\u201315 Woodham led his developing team to a second Berks & Bucks Trophy final victory, this time beating Flackwell Heath 3\u20132 After Extra Time in a pulsating game at Burnham F.C. Windsor F.C. finished the season in 5th place in the CCL Premier Division.

Season 2016-17 Windsor F.C. managed to one better their previous seasons league finish, finishing 11th despite many squad changes throughout the season. For the 2017\u20132018 season Windsor F.C. were moved to the Hellenic League Premier Division.

Wanderers spent most the season in fifth place and did the double over Kettering Town and arguably denied them the league title, as they did Colchester United, from whom they took four points.", "The greatest excitement was had in the FA Trophy, where Wealdstone, VS Rugby, Cheltenham Town and Northwich Victoria were seen off en route to the semi-finals. The draw wasn't particularly kind, pitting them against Altrincham, who had hit an amazing run of form, and were pushing for the Conference title. The first leg at Adams Park saw Alty take an early lead which was quickly cancelled out by a Dave Carroll equaliser. Keith Scott poached a winning goal with 18 minutes remaining and a lead was taken into the second leg at Moss Lane. It proved to be a nervous affair, Wycombe were desperate to make a return to Wembley, and take revenge for being denied that prize nine years previously by the same opponents. A tense first half ended in stalemate and just before the hour Mark West poked home from a corner to give the Wanderers a crucial lead. The home side lost their heads and were soon down ten men and in the last minute Keith Scott wrapped up a 4\u20131 aggregate win from the penalty spot. The Wanderers were back at Wembley and the celebrations went long into the night. Nearly 25,000 Wycombe fans travelled to Wembley, and were part of a record 34,842 crowd for a FA Trophy final at the old stadium. Keith Scott gave the Blues the lead and Kidderminster Harriers goalkeeper Paul Jones kept his team in it with a string of stunning saves. Just before the hour Dave Hadley's daisy cutter slipped under Wanderers goalkeeper John Granville, who played the game with a broken thumb. Wycombe weren't going to be denied as less than ten minutes later Keith Scott broke down the right wing and crossed for local hero Mark West to dive low and head in the winner! It was a fitting end to a sensational season. Average crowds at Adams Park rose from 1,800 to 2,800 and Mark West was crowned Conference Player of the Season after scoring 34 goals.", "The Blues went into the new year behind in points but with games in hand and despite disappointing cup exits at home to Kettering Town and Witton Albion, they continued the fight for the Championship. O'Neill signed some much sought after players, striker Kim Casey joined from Cheltenham Town for \u00a39,000, Dennis Greene arrived for \u00a315,000 from Chelmsford City and the real coup of local-rivals Slough Town tailsman Steve Thompson for \u00a325,000. In April, the Blues caught up in matches played and even overtook Colchester at the top of the league, but a 3\u20131 defeat at Macclesfield Town would prove costly. A 2\u20131 aggregate win over Runcorn saw the club win more silverware in the Bob Lord Trophy but the big prize was still up for grabs. An 86th minute at Gateshead from Keith Scottlooked to have put the Blues back on top of the league, but Colchester had snatched a late equaliser in a 4\u20134 draw at Macclesfield Town. The Wanderers were level on points with their Essex rivals, and despite a 5\u20130 thrashing away at Redbridge Forest, they were behind on goal difference going into the final day. A 4\u20130 thrashing of Witton Albion at Adams Park wasn't enough as Colchester United beat Barrow 5\u20130 to take the title with a nine better goal difference, both clubs having a then record conference tally of 94 points. It was a crashing disappointment and there was a failed summer campaign for the club to replace Aldershot, who had gone out of business.", "Martin O'Neill kept faith with the team that had come so close to promotion and the 1992\u201393 season started in similar fashion to the last one, with the side winning nine league games in a row. An exciting tie took place in the second round of the FA Cup, with the Blues drawn at home to Ossie Ardiles' Third Division side West Bromwich Albion. A stunning fightback, live on Sky TV, saw goals from Glyn Creaser and Steve Thompson take the Baggies back to the Hawthorns. The replay was also shown live, and an amazing 4,500 Wycombe fans made the journey to the black country. They saw Keith Scott hit a post before Bob Taylor snatched a goal winner just nine minutes from time. Even in injury-time the Wanderers came agonisingly close to snatching an equaliser, Steve Guppy just inches from connecting with a Simon Hutchinson cross.", "Inspirational captain Glyn Creaser suffered a bad injury to his foot and when the side went on a run of four games without a win in February and March 1993, local rivals Slough Town came within four points of the Blues, having played two games more. The sides met at Adams Park and a then record crowd of 7,230, with many more locked out, saw a tense game that was decided by a 27th winner from Keith Scott. Wanderers had to play most of the second half with ten men when Andy Kerr was sent off, but some determined defending and fine goalkeeping from Paul Hyde ensured the three points. Martin O'Neill signed striker Tim Langford from Telford United for \u00a315,000 and the sides went on another run in the FA Trophy. Wins over Cheltenham Town, Morecambe, Bromsgrove Rovers and Gateshead led the club to semi-final with Sutton United, managed by former boss Alan Gane. The U's sprung a great shock by winning the first leg at Adams Park 3\u20132. The tie was missed by Keith Scott through injury and he even took to an oxygen chamber to get fit for the second leg. The tension was palpable as more than half the 5,002 crowd at Gander Green Lane travelled to support the Blues. Keith Scott was declared fit and after a number of missed chances, centre-back Matt Crossley headed home from a corner and immediate sunk to his knees with a mixture of joy and relief. The visitors came out in the second half and grabbed the tie by the throat. On 48 minutes Keith Scott headed home from a Guppy corner and three minutes later Matt Crossley swept home another corner, this time from Dave Carroll, to make it 3\u20130. Keith Scott was replaced by Mark West with 15 minutes and within three minutes with his first touch he crossed for Dave Carroll to finish emphatically to make it 4\u20130. The 6\u20133 aggregate win saw the Blues go back to Wembley and the pitch was engulfed by celebrating fans at the final whistle. The following week there was even more celebrations, after a 1\u20131 draw with nearest challengers Slough Town, a 5\u20131 thrashing of Runcorn at Adams Park, including a sensational solo goal from Steve Guppy, saw the Wanderers all but seal promotion to the Football League.", "As he did the previous summer, O'Neill kept faith in his squad. Just three of his players, Glyn Creaser, Mark West and Steve Thompson remained part-time as the club full-time for the first time in its history. The Football League imposed very stringent financial conditions on the club, after experiences with Maidstone United and Barnet  The fixture list was also rather unhelpful, as the opening fixture of the 1993\u201394 season would be away at Carlisle United. However, more than 1,500 Chairboys and girls made the long journey and were part of a 7,752 crowd that witnessed history in the making. The newcomers endured a torrid opening 20 minutes, Rod Thomas giving the Cumbrians the lead. However, the Wanderers soon found their feet and equalised three minutes before half-time. The first Football League goal in the club's history was an own-goal scored by Chris Curran: with 18 minutes Steve Guppy became the first Wycombe player to score in the Football League when he turned the ball home at the far post; however, Curran made up for his error ten minutes later by firing home an equaliser and the game finished 2\u20132. A Keith Scott goal gave the Blues their first ever victory in the Football League, a 1\u20130 win over Chester City at Adams Park. The league newcomers made a great start, remaining unbeaten in their first eight league matches. After beating Leyton Orient 3\u20130 on aggregate in the first round of the Football League Cup the team came agonisingly close to knocking out Premier League Coventry City in the second round. A 3\u20130 first leg deficit was overturned and a Jason Cousins free-kick gave the Wanderers a 4\u20130 lead early in extra time. Goals from Steve Morgan and a deflected Phil Babb effort saw the Sky Blues through 5\u20134 on aggregate.", "In the FA Cup the team again beat two sides from the league above, winning 2\u20131 at Bristol Rovers and 1\u20130 at home to Cambridge United. The tie at Twerton Park would be striker Keith Scott's last game, he signed for Premier League Swindon Town for an eventual fee of \u00a3375,000. His replacement was Tony Hemmings, signed earlier in the season from Northwich Victoria and he made an immediate impact, scoring twice in a 3\u20131 home win over promotion rivals Crewe Alexandra. The following weekend the club travelled up to another promotion rival, Preston North End. Their Deepdale ground still had a plastic pitch and they were managed by John Beck. Two goals from Tim Langford were cancelled out but a last minute strike from Hakan Hayrettin, his only goal for Wycombe, from just inside the Preston half stunned the home crowd and sent the visiting fans in delirium. Premier League Norwich City ended interest in the FA Cup, winning the third round tie at Adams Park 2\u20130. There was still another cup run to be had in the Associate Members Cup. The Southern Area Quarter-Final at Craven Cottage saw 2,500 Wycombe fans make the short trip into the capital to see Tim Langford notch a brace in a 2\u20132 draw. The game went to penalties and Jason Cousins tucked home the winning spot-kick to spark more celebrations. The game marked the debut of striker Simon Garner, who soon become a cult hero at Adams Park. Victory did come at a cost, centre-back Terry Evans was injured and missed the rest of the season.", "The summer of 1996 was one of change. Out went the likes of Simon Garner, Steve Thompson, Simon Stapleton, Tony Hemmings and Terry Howard. In came two goalkeepers, Brian Parkin and John Cheesewright and centre-back Paul McCarthy, a \u00a3100,000 capture from Brighton & Hove Albion. The season started in bizarre fashion, in more than one sense. The club had to play its opening game of the season away at Shrewsbury Town on a Sunday due to the town's flower show and the team wore a new pin-striped change shirt, which was christened with a stunning equaliser from Steve Brown to earn a 1\u20131 draw. Alan Smith always had a tough act to follow in O'Neill and after falling-out with popular players, playing a role in the changing of the quartered kit to stripes and disappointing performances he had to get results. But he didn't, and after a start of eight league games without a win, the ninth game, a 6\u20133 defeat by Peterborough United was the final straw and he was sacked. Caretaker boss Neil Smillie helped guide the team to two important wins, over Rotherham United and Notts County but a series of defeats followed which left the side languishing at the bottom of the table. It was something of a surprise when John Gregory, a coach at Aston Villa, was appointed the new boss. He slowly started to turn things around, and the team started winning regularly at home. A first round FA Cup tie with rivals Colchester United at Layer Road added some excitement and goals from Miquel Desouza and one from a suspiciously offside looking John Williams gave the Wanderers a very sweet 2\u20131 victory. Gregory realised the need to strengthen the squad and brought in midfielder Michael Simpson from Notts County for \u00a350,000, Michael Forsyth and Jason Kavanagh from Derby County, for \u00a325,000 each, striker Mark Stallard from Bradford City for \u00a3100,000 and striker Paul Read from Arsenal, also for \u00a3100,000. A first away win of the season was gained with an exciting 4\u20133 victory at Bristol Rovers just before Christmas. The team won eight of its last ten home games, remaining unbeaten at Adams Park. However, away wins proved elusive and the battle to avoid relegation went right to the wire. A pivotal result was secured at home to relegation rivals Shrewsbury Town, and it featured two loanees, goalkeeper Martin Taylor from Derby County and returning striker Keith Scott from Norwich City, making his second debut for the club. Taylor made a number of crucial saves and Scott gave the Wanderers the lead and went to win 3\u20130. A second away win came at Notts County, A long-range opportunist strike from Steve Brown was cancelled out, but a winner from Steve McGavin gave the Blues a 2\u20131 win and condemned County to the drop. It was a great escape and Wycombe had won its first battle against relegation in the Football League.", "Martin Taylor, on a free transfer, and Keith Scott, for \u00a355,000, both signed permanently in the close season and the club reverted to the popular quartered shirt for the 1997\u201398 campaign. They were defeated 5\u20132 by newly promoted Wigan Athletic at Springfield Park. However, after a 4\u20131 home win over Southend United in early September the side reached third place. It wouldn't last as a similar pattern to the previous season emerged. The team was very reliable at Adams Park, losing just three league games there all season. But there were just four away wins as the side struggled on its travels and finished in 14th place. There was bitter disappointment in the FA Cup as the club were the victims of a giant-killing for the first time as a Football League club. Basingstoke Town came from 2\u20130 draw to gain a 2\u20132 draw at Adams Park before a similar result in the replay at the Camrose Ground. Keith Scott saw his decisive spot-kick saved and the non-leaguers won 5\u20134 on penalties. The biggest shock came in February 1998 when manager John Gregory was chosen to as the unlikely successor to Brian Little at his former club Aston Villa. Youth team boss Neil Smillie again took caretaker control and after losing just two of 12 games in charge he was given the job on a permanent basis.", "Terry Evans took caretaker charge for almost a month until Lawrie Sanchez was appointed in February 1999. His first game in charge was a creditable 1\u20131 draw at home to Kevin Keegan's high flying Fulham Steve McGavin left the club for personal reasons before Sanchez was appointed and the new boss was told he had to make \u00a3200,000 from transfers before the end of the season. His first signing was Canadian defender Mark Rogers, who paid his own air fare to England to pursue his dream of playing professional football. By March Jason Kavanagh and Nicky Mohan had departed for Stoke City whilst Notts County paid \u00a320,000 for Mark Stallard. Striker Sean Devine was brought in on loan from Barnet but there was stunning news to follow when Keith Scott signed for local rivals Reading for \u00a3250,000. Scott departed on the same evening that Wanderers travelled to Bristol Rovers, five points adrift at the bottom of the table and eight points from safety. A brave header from Jason Cousins gave the visitors the lead, one which saw Cousins miss the rest of the season and a Sean Devine shot from the edge of the area in the second half brought an unlikely victory. It proved to be a catalyst as the side lost just 2 of its last 11 league games. The highlight was a 2\u20131 win away at Manchester City, where first half goals from Baird and Devine sealed a magnificent double against the fallen giants. Devine was signed permanently for a club record \u00a3200,000. The penultimate game of the season was at home to promotion chasing Wigan Athletic, who went a goal up in the first half but soon pegged back by some sharper shooting from Devine. Early in the second half Paul Emblen deflected in the winning goal to set up a tense final day away at Lincoln City. The club paid for 30-odd supporters coaches and 2,643 Wanderers made the journey to Sincil Bank. A tense game saw Baird miss a golden early chance and when Michael Forsyth hit the post it looked like it really was mission impossible. However, with just seven minutes of the season remaining Devine crossed for Emblen a header over Vaughan and into the top corner of the net. It was an incredible finale to amazing escape from a relegation that seemed a certainty for much of the season. It brought the new manager much praise, but he was to go on to even greater things."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["| Keith Scott", "|19 March 2001||FW||||Keith Scott||Colchester United||Free||", "|12 October 2000||FW||||Keith Scott||Colchester United||One-Month||"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["| Keith Scott", "||FW||||12||Keith Scott||3||0||2||1||6", "|12||||FW||Keith Scott||3||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||4||0"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["| Keith Scott", "| Keith Scott", "||FW||||Keith Scott||2||0||0||0||2"]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Keith Scott"]}]}}
