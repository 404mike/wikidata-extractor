The translation was made by Robert Young, compiler of Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible and Concise Critical Comments on the New Testament. Young used the Textus Receptus (TR) and the Masoretic Text (MT) as the basis for his translation. He wrote in the preface to the first edition, \"It has been no part of the Translator's plan to attempt to form a New Hebrew or Greek Text\u2014he has therefore somewhat rigidly adhered to the received ones.\" Young produced a \"Revised Version\" of his translation in 1887, but he stuck with the Received Text. He wrote in the preface to the Revised Edition, \"The Greek Text followed is that generally recognized as the 'Received Text,' not because it is thought perfect, but because the department of Translation is quite distinct from that of textual criticism, and few are qualified for both. If the original text be altered by a translator, (except he give his reasons for and against each emendation,) the reader is left in uncertainty whether the translation given is to be considered as that of the old or of the new reading.\" A new Revised Edition was released ten years after Robert Young's death on October 14, 1888. The 1898 version was based on the TR, easily confirmed by the word \"bathe\" in Revelation 1:5 and the word \"again\" in Revelation 20:5.
