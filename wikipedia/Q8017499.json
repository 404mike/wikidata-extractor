After a dull and goalless first half, Tommy Hands crossed the ball for Wheldon to open the scoring, from which point goals followed regularly until the match finished as a 4\u20133 home win. Wheldon was involved in two of his side's three goals, but was \"too closely watched by Reynolds to be as effective as usual\". On a day when the hard and slippery surface meant \"those teams whose players have the least regard for the safety of their limbs usually gain the victory\", Small Heath, without Hallam, who was unwell, and William Reynolds, injured against Aston Villa, defeated a \"very indifferent\" Northwich Victoria 7\u20130. In their next match, at Crewe Alexandra, the home players reportedly played \"with supreme indifference to the safety of their opponents' limbs\". Hands, who had been one of Small Heath's better performers, was carried off after receiving a \"nasty kick\" to the leg, but despite having to play with ten men, the visitors won 5\u20133. Of Crewe's three goals, the first should have been disallowed for offside and the third was a Ted Devey own goal.", "Fred Speller attempted a comeback, appearing twice for the first team early in the season, but the injury received against Darwen proved the end of his professional football career.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 126.
