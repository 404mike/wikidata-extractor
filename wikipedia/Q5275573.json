However, the day after the election, with the LNP's victory beyond doubt even though counting was still under way in several seats, Bligh announced she was resigning as premier and retiring from politics. An hour later, Newman announced that he intended to advise Governor Penny Wensley that he was able to form a government. He also announced that he intended to have himself and his top two shadow ministers, Seeney and Tim Nicholls, sworn in as an interim three-man government until a full ministry could be named, with Seeney as deputy premier and Nicholls as treasurer.(24 March 2012). \"Newman announces his deputy, treasurer\"  ABC News. Retrieved 9 December 2013. Newman was formally sworn in as Queensland's 38th premier on 26 March. His interim government remained in office until the full ministry was sworn in a week later. Upon swearing-in, he became the first non-Labor premier from the Brisbane area, as well as the first non-interim premier aligned federally with the Liberals (or their predecessors) since Digby Denham left office in 1915. The last Liberal premier of Queensland, Gordon Chalk, served as a caretaker between the death of Jack Pizzey in 1968 and the election of Joh Bjelke-Petersen later that year. He is also the first person since Federation to lead a party to victory while not himself serving in the legislature at the time of the election. Newman entered office with the largest majority government in Queensland history, and percentage-wise the largest legislative majority in any Australian state or federal election in history at the time. He announced that he would focus on rebuilding Queensland's economy and setting its finances in order. He also asked his large party room to put together plans to \"deliver their promises\" in their own seats.\"Newman set to get to work in Qld\" . ABC News Breakfast. (26 March 2013).

With his defeat in Ashgrove beyond doubt even though counting had not been finalised, Newman announced his retirement from politics on election night. He immediately resigned as both premier and LNP leader, though he remained as caretaker premier for nearly two weeks while the overall result was in doubt. Newman was the second sitting Queensland premier to lose his own seat, the first being Digby Denham. Ultimately, in a shock result, Labor came up just one seat short of the 36-seat swing it needed to win back government in its own right, and was able to form a minority government with the support of independent Peter Wellington."]}, {"page": "Politics of Queensland", "response": ["Despite its landslide win, the Liberal National Party did not last long in government; it suffered a swing of 14.0% against it at the 2015 state election, while Campbell Newman became the second premier in Queensland history to be defeated in his own seat, by previous incumbent Kate Jones. Coincidentally, this happened almost 100 years after Digby Denham became the first premier to lose his seat when he was defeated in the seat of Oxley by Labor candidate Thomas Llewellyn Jones in 1915. Labor, led by Opposition Leader Annastacia Palaszczuk, won 44 seats and the backing of independent MP Peter Wellington and formed a minority government."]}, {"page": "Robert Philp", "response": ["The Australian colonies federated in 1901 and the new Prime Minister Edmund Barton immediately ended the trade in Kanakas. By this stage Queensland was severely depleted in revenue, and Federation exacerbated this situation by depriving Queensland of excise and customs funds. Despite a severe drought and the dire state of the state's finances, Philp was re-elected in 1902.

The non-Labor forces in Queensland were in a period of chronic disunity, with the Country Party coming into conflict with what was then known as the Queensland Liberal Party but would later also be called the National and then the United Party.

At this point it is believed that Digby Denham, then a member of the Stephens Divisional Board (and later a Premier of Queensland), proposed to call it Annerley after the township variously spelled Annerley, Annerly or Anerly in Surrey, England.
