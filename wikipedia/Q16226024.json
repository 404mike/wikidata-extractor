Gibson finally sold the club to local businessman Harold Hornsey, who at least was able to financially stabilise the club; but with little money available for players times were hard. MacPhail left early in 1994\u201395 and was replaced by Dave McCreery; he was replaced towards the end of the same season by Keith Houchen, who had returned as a player. Houchen was in turn replaced after 18 months by Mick Tait. Meanwhile, the club finished in 18th, 20th (twice) and 17th. There was also a change of ownership in 1997: Hornsey sold the club to an IOR Ltd, with Ken Hodcroft becoming chairman.", "After an extensive overhaul of the playing squad during the summer, Hartlepool recovered from a poor start to the 2013\u201314 season and by early spring they were making decent progress and looking to make a late play-off bid. However, a terrible run of form late in the season put them into the relegation battle, which they did not earn definite safety from until the penultimate match of the season. The club finished 19th that season, their lowest finish in 15 years. In the 2014\u201315 season, Cooper resigned a few weeks into the campaign following a 3\u20130 home defeat to Carlisle United which left Hartlepool at the bottom of the Football League. Paul Murray replaced Cooper, only to be sacked just two months later, with the club six points adrift at the bottom of League Two, and having just suffered an FA Cup elimination at the hands of non-league Blyth Spartans.  Ken Hodcroft, resigned and sold the club to Peter Harris in December 2014. Harris' first decision was to appoint former Tranmere Rovers manager Ronnie Moore to the managers' job. The takeover ultimately fell through due to Harris and his associates being involved in dubious activities with the club reverting to Hodcroft's ownership.  After being ten points adrift in bottom place at the turn of the year, in what has been termed the \"great escape\" and \"miracle\", a revival in form saw Hartlepool escape the relegation places and secure survival in the penultimate game of the season."]}, {"page": "Stuart Drummond", "response": ["He approached Hartlepool United Football Club chairman Ken Hodcroft with the idea to stand for Mayor and the club was happy to put up his \u00a3500 election deposit. The club saw it as a chance to generate publicity and their name and club sponsors were given a global platform.  Drummond took part in no serious campaigning and among his promises was for the council to provide free bananas for school children in the town - which he later delivered. Online bookmakers Bet365 offered odds on Drummond / H'Angus being elected and odds tumbled in one day from 100-1 to 4-1 as his supporters showed their support."]}, {"page": "Chris Turner (footballer, born 1958)", "response": ["Turner was appointed manager at Hartlepool United by chairman Ken Hodcroft on 24 February 1999, who were sitting bottom of the Football League following Mick Tait's departure. He proved to be an instant success at Victoria Park, keeping the Monkey Hangers two places and three points ahead of Scarborough, who were relegated into non-league football and never to return at the end of the 1998\u201399 season following a real upturn in form. He then led Pools to a seventh-place finish in 1999\u20132000, though a 3\u20130 aggregate defeat to Darlington in the play-off semi-finals saw them remain in the Third Division. He was named as Third Division Manager of the Month for January 2001. Hartlepool narrowly missed out on a place in the automatic promotion places in 2000\u201301, and ended up losing 5\u20131 on aggregate to Blackpool in the play-off semi-finals. More play-off heartbreak followed in 2001\u201302, this time they took Cheltenham Town to penalties after two legs of the semi-finals. He left the club, sitting top of the table, to manage his boyhood club on 7 November 2002, leaving Mike Newell to complete the task of securing promotion for Hartlepool."]}, {"page": "Neale Cooper", "response": ["After a break from the game to recharge his batteries and refresh, Cooper was appointed manager of Hartlepool United. Pools had been promoted from the bottom tier of English football to Division Two for the third time in their history, but manager Mike Newell had been sacked. He was a surprise choice of chairman Ken Hodcroft, but Cooper's strong Aberdeen links, with Pools owners IOR Ltd based in the Scottish city, helped his cause. Hodcroft was impressed by Cooper from their first encounter. Upon appointment, Cooper joked \"I've com from Ross County, which is somewhere up near Iceland\"."]}, {"page": "H'Angus", "response": ["Drummond approached Hartlepool chairman Ken Hodcroft with an idea for some publicity and asked him to fund the \u00a3500 deposit that would allow him to stand for election. Hodcroft accepted the proposal but wanted the club to stay out of politics so forced Drummond to make the agenda his own and separate from the club. Drummond ran for mayor under his own name, campaigning for \"free bananas\" for all schoolchildren. He campaigned both at matches, much to the bemusement of opposition fans, and also locally and away from the football pitch. On 2 May 2002, days after Pools' play-off semi-final defeat at Cheltenham and an extension to the season that allowed the campaigning monkey to carry on his drive for votes, Drummond was elected the first directly elected mayor of Hartlepool. Drummond immediately decided to concentrate on politics and ceased being H'Angus; he was quoted as saying, \"I am Stuart Drummond, I am the Mayor of Hartlepool, not the monkey.\" Drummond was re-elected in 2005, more than doubling his vote (up to over 16,000) and increasing his majority to over 10,000. At the same time, turnout increased from 30% to 51%. On the night of the election count, he proposed to his girlfriend, Rebecca Buttery, who accepted. In 2009, Drummond was re-elected for a third term."]}, {"page": "Adam Boyd", "response": ["Boyd's lack of first team appearances prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper to loan him to Boston United to gain match practice. During his time at Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring four goals before returning to Hartlepool. Boyd returned nine pounds overweight and looked set to leave Hartlepool United after angering Cooper. When asked about his weight gain, Boyd claimed that he had been eating more to build up his strength but when asked about gym work he said he had not started it yet. Boston looked set to make permanent deal for Boyd and made an offer for the striker. However, both teams failed to reach an agreement with Boston claiming that Hartlepool were asking far too much. It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, Ken Hodcroft, wanted a five figure sum, but Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure amount of around \u00a35,000.", "On 28 July 2006, Boyd signed a three-year contract with Luton Town after Hartlepool accepted a bid in the range of \u00a3500,000. Before leaving, Boyd thanked Hartlepool's coaches, managers and fans for helping him to develop and supporting him. He also thanked Chris Turner, Ken Hodcroft and Danny Wilson for allowing the transfer to happen so he could fulfil his ambitions. On his debut for Luton Town, he played a part in setting up Carlos Edwards' goal against Leicester City to make the game 2\u20130. Boyd's first goal for Luton Town came in a League Cup match against Bristol Rovers \u2013 the game finished 1\u20131 with Luton winning 5\u20133 on penalties. It appeared that Boyd was way behind the rest of the team in terms of fitness and match sharpness. However, Newell believed this was because Boyd has \"had the best part of a year out of the game\". Boyd scored his first League goal for Luton against Queens Park Rangers in a match likely to be remembered for Newell's post match comments about female assistant referee Amy Rayner."]}, {"page": "Michael Nelson (footballer)", "response": ["However Nelson failed to maintain this through to the 2004\u201305 season and he handed in a transfer request. His agent claimed that he'd been \"promised\" a better deal. This triggered a feud with Hartlepool chairman Ken Hodcroft who criticised Nelson and his agent. Nelson was missing in several of Hartlepool's matches and was rumoured to be signing for Hull City for a fee of around \u00a3100,000. However Nelson withdrew his transfer request and was reinstalled into the starting line-up. His performances earned him an improved contract and he was offered a new three-year contract that would tie him to the club until 2008."]}, {"page": "Jack Ross (footballer, born 1976)", "response": ["Ross signed a pre-contractual agreement with Hartlepool United in April 2004.
