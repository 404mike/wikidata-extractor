He was born at Offley, Hertfordshire and died near Godstone, Surrey.\nMcNiven was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. At Eton, he played in the Eton v Harrow cricket matches of 1843 and 1844 primarily as a bowler. Between 1846 and 1848, he appeared in several matches for Cambridge University, playing largely as a right-handed lower middle-order batsman; he played in the 1846 University Match against Oxford University but was not picked for the matches in 1847 or 1848. His best batting came in a match against a side calling itself \"Cambridge Townsmen\" in 1848, when he was unbeaten on 88 when the university innings ended. McNiven did not play any first-class cricket in 1849 or in 1850, the year he graduated from Cambridge University, but in 1851 he played four games inside a month for four teams: the Marylebone Cricket Club, Surrey, the Gentlemen in the annual Lord's Gentlemen v Players fixture, and the Gentlemen of England team. Those were his final appearances in senior cricket.\nMcNiven became a lawyer and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1849. He was killed \"near Westerham\" when his dog cart overturned in January 1858; the family home at the time was Perrysfield, near Godstone, and in some references this is given as the place of death.", "link_mentions": {}}}
