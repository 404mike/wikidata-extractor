Schenker was only 18 at the time but was already a well-respected guitarist. On a new label, Chrysalis Records, the revamped UFO recorded a non-LP single in 1973, \"Give Her the Gun\" and \"Sweet Little Thing\" with producer Derek Lawrence. In 1974, under producer Leo Lyons (formerly of Ten Years After), UFO recorded Phenomenon, which highlighted the band's harder-edged guitar sound. Phenomenon contains many fan favourites such as \"Doctor Doctor\" (later a minor hit single as a live track) and \"Rock Bottom\" (which was extended live to provide a showcase for Schenker). By the time of the Phenomenon tour, ex-Skid Row guitarist Paul \"Tonka\" Chapman joined the group, but he left in January 1975 to form Lone Star."]}, {"page": "Force It", "response": ["The album was produced by Ten Years After bass player Leo Lyons.
