The name Steeleye Span comes from a character in the traditional song \"Horkstow Grange\" (which they did not actually record until they released an album by that name in 1998). The song gives an account of a fight between John \"Steeleye\" Span and John Bowlin, neither of whom is proven to have been a real person. Martin Carthy gave Hart the idea to name the band after the song character.  When the band discussed names, they decided to choose among the three suggestions \"Middlemarch Wait\", \"Iyubidin's Wait\", and \"Steeleye Span\".

Furthermore, Martin Carthy and Peter Knight performed on four songs released on Roy Bailey's eponymous debut album in 1971.", "At the time of their seventh album, Commoners Crown, the advent of punk saw the mainstream market turning away from folk rock almost overnight, heralding a downturn in commercial fortunes for the band.

The unannounced idea was Maddy Prior's and, remarkably, no-one was injured in the rush to grab the falling notes. Indeed, contemporary press reports indicated that it took some time for the crowd to even realise what was happening.\"Band showers fans with pound notes\", Associated Press wire story published in The Toronto Star, 26 November 1976, Page F1.
