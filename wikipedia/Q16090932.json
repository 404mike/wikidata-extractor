At the suggestion of the Royal Geographical Society and the Scott Polar Institute, he decided to focus his attention on the subantarctic island of South Georgia. His efforts over the next several decades won him a preeminent place in South Georgia's history. He organised and led the South Georgia Survey of 1951\u201357, surveying much of the interior of the island. Mount Carse and Carse Point are named after him. The comprehensive survey of the island resulted in the classic 1:200000 topographic map of South Georgia, occasionally updated but never superseded since its first publication by the British Directorate of Overseas Surveys in 1958. A full account of the four South Georgia Survey expeditions led by Duncan Carse was written by the geologist on 1951\u201352 and 1953\u201354 Surveys, Alec Trendall."]}, {"page": "South Georgia Survey", "response": ["The first expedition consisted of six men: Carse, deputy leader Kevin Walton, the surveyors Gordon Smillie and John Heaney, the geologist Alec Trendall, and the mountaineer Walter Roots.
