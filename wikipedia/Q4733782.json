Olive, Lady Baillie, daughter of Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough and his first wife, Pauline Payne Whitney, an American heiress. Lady Baillie bought the castle in 1926 for \u00a3180,000 (). She redecorated the interior, first working with the French architect and designer Armand-Albert Rateau, who oversaw exterior alterations and added interior features such as a 16th-century-style carved-oak staircase,  then with the Paris decorator St\u00e9phane Boudin. During the early part of World War II the castle was used as a hospital where Lady Baillie and her daughters hosted burned Commonwealth airmen as part of their recovery. Survivors remembered the experience with fondness. Upon her death in 1974, Lady Baillie left the castle to the Leeds Castle Foundation, a private charitable trust whose aim is to preserve the castle and grounds for the benefit of the public. An estimated \u00a31.4 million (equivalent to \u00a3\u00a0million in ) was invested and a further \u00a3400,000 (\u00a3 million in ) was retrieved from the sale of the furniture to make improvements to the Castle and attract paying corporate conferences. However, it was quickly understood that it could not support the ongoing costs of running the Estate, so in 1975 the gardens were opened to the public, and the following year the Castle was also made available to visitors."]}, {"page": "Baron Queenborough", "response": ["#REDIRECT Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough "]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough (1861\u20131949), Conservative MP for Cambridge (1910\u20131917)"]}, {"page": "Camille Clifford", "response": ["* Capt.
