A high-profile lesbian in the Paris of the Belle \u00c9poque, she is notable for her work, which has received more attention following a recent revival of interest in Sapphic verse. Many of her poems are autobiographical, pertaining mostly to Baudelarian themes of extreme romanticism and frequent despair. She was the subject of a pen-portrait by her friend and neighbor Colette.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
