A high-profile lesbian in the Paris of the Belle \u00c9poque, she is notable for her work, which has received more attention following a recent revival of interest in Sapphic verse. Many of her poems are autobiographical, pertaining mostly to Baudelarian themes of extreme romanticism and frequent despair.

She wrote in both French and English. In her writings she supported feminism and pacifism. She opposed monogamy and had many overlapping long and short-term relationships, including on-and-off romances with poet Ren\u00e9e Vivien and dancer Armen Ohanian and a 50-year relationship with painter Romaine Brooks. Her life and love affairs served as inspiration for many novels written by others, ranging from the salacious French bestseller Idylle Saphique to The Well of Loneliness, the most famous lesbian novel of the twentieth century.Barney's roles in Sapphic Idyll and The Well of Loneliness are discussed in Rodriguez, 94\u201395 and 273\u2013275; regarding the fame of The Well, see Lockard.", "==Ren\u00e9e Vivien==", "In November 1899, Barney met the poet Pauline Tarn, better known by her pen name Ren\u00e9e Vivien.

Their romantic relationship was also a creative exchange that inspired both of them to write. Barney provided a feminist theoretical framework which Vivien explored in her poetry. They adapted the imagery of the Symbolist poets along with the conventions of courtly love to describe love between women, also finding examples of heroic women in history and myth.Jay, xii\u2013xiv. Sappho was an especially important influence and they studied Greek so as to read the surviving fragments of her poetry in the original.

This was a response to the influential French Academy which had been founded in the 17th century by Louis XIII and whose 40 \"immortals\" included no women at the time. Unlike the French Academy, her Women's Academy was not a formal organization, but rather a series of readings held as part of the regular Friday salons. Honorees included Colette, Gertrude Stein, Anna Wickham, Rachilde, Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes and posthumously, Ren\u00e9e Vivien.Wickes, 153, 167.", "Due in part to Jean Chalon's early biography of her, published in English as Portrait of a Seductress, Barney had become more widely known for her many relationships than for her writing or her salon.\"I would be asked at dinner parties what I was working on and, replying, 'Natalie Clifford Barney,' I expected the usual post Jean Chalon response, 'What? The lesbian Don Juan?'\"  Livia (1992), 181. She once wrote out a list, divided into three categories: liaisons, demi-liaisons, and adventures. Colette was a demi-liaison, while the artist and furniture designer Eyre de Lanux, with whom she had an off-and-on affair for several years, was listed as an adventure.  Among the liaisons\u2014the relationships that she considered most important\u2014were Olive Custance, Ren\u00e9e Vivien, \u00c9lisabeth de Gramont, Romaine Brooks, and Dolly Wilde.Schenkar, 156, and Rodriguez, 298, give slightly different accounts of this list. Of these, the three longest relationships were with de Gramont, Brooks, and Wilde; from 1927, she was involved with all three of them simultaneously, a situation that ended only with Wilde's death.  Her shorter affairs, such as those with Colette and Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, often evolved into lifelong friendships.", "Her indirect influence on literature, through her salon and her many literary friendships, can be seen in the number of writers who have addressed or portrayed her in their works.  Claudine s'en va (Claudine and Annie, 1903) by Colette contains a brief appearance by Barney as \"Miss Flossie,\"Wickes, 98. echoing the nickname she had earlier been given in de Pougy's novel Idylle Saphique.  Ren\u00e9e Vivien wrote many poems about her, as well as a Symbolist novel, Une femme m\u2019apparut (A Woman Appeared to Me, 1904), in which Barney is described as having \"eyes ... as sharp and blue as a blade.... The charm of peril emanated from her and drew me inexorably.\"Jay, 9, 13. Remy de Gourmont addressed her in his Letters to the Amazon, and Truman Capote mentioned her in his last, unfinished novel Answered Prayers.  She also appeared in later novels by writers who never met her. Anna Livia's Minimax (1991) portrays both Barney and Ren\u00e9e Vivien as still-living vampires. Francesco Rapazzini's Un soir chez l'Amazone (2001) is a historical novel about Barney's salon.

The protagonist of the novel is a hermaphrodite named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soir\u00e9es. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Ren\u00e9e Vivien.Livia (1995), 22\u201323. The book's portrayal of her is, at times, harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys.  Marion tells Wells that she is \"perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... [but] a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion....

She was most outspoken about the brutality and misogyny sometimes depicted by Surrealists and was highly critical of certain figures within the movement, such as Max Ernst, who was also notable for his use of collage as a medium.  Her husband, Roland Penrose, was a primarily visual artist who was a notable figure within the Surrealist movement while associating Valentine Penrose with other Surrealist artists.  Much of Valentine Penrose's art was created using traditional art and collage images which were sourced from common publications such as journals, catalogues and books. Her portfolio includes various collages and a collage novel entitled Dons des F\u00e9minines, which incorporated her literary background in its composition. Dons des F\u00e9minines has been called the \"archetypal surrealist book\" since it uses compositional elements that are expected of Surrealist art. The format is fragmented and uses bilingual poetry in combination with the visual imagery of the collages to create disorientation and continuous translation. The images are arranged to create juxtapositions and lack of continuity and become increasingly complex. There are references to Penrose's other, more cohesive, literary work but the novel does not have a singular format. The background for the works is typically of natural scenery or a landscape in which foreign elements are added, sometimes symbolically to create paradoxes. The recurring themes throughout the novel are gender ambiguity, love and prophetic writing. Lesbian love, in particular, is an important theme in much of Penrose's work, but especially in Dons des f\u00e9minines. Lesbian love is indeed a crucial theme in the book because it recounts the romantic escape of two women and their dreamlike adventures together. In addition, the author-collagist mentions the city of \"Mytilene\" to evoke the Sapphic island of Lesbos. This reference to the Mediterranean shows that exoticism is an important theme of the work, but also that Penrose inscribes herself into the Sapphic tradition of Ren\u00e9e Vivien, Natalie Barney or Charles Baudelaire to just a few emblematic figures.Beth Fenn Kearney, \"'Un dimanche \u00e0 Mytil\u00e8ne'\u00a0: topographies de l'exotisme dans Dons des f\u00e9minines (1951) de Valentine Penrose\", Revue Postures, 2020, URL: http://revuepostures.com/fr/articles/kearney-31"]}]}}
