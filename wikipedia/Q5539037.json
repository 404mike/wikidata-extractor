Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the British Empire, especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as James Wilkinson Breeks, Sir Alexander Cunningham, Sir Harold Deane,  Sir Walter Elliot, James Prinsep, Charles Masson, Sir John Marshall and Charles Stuart. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker George Eumorfopoulos in the 1930s. The large collection of some 1800 Japanese prints and paintings owned by Arthur Morrison was acquired in the early twentieth century. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the philanthropist PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection."]}, {"page": "Charles Vyse", "response": ["Vyse's neighbour, George Eumorfopoulos, had amassed a large collection of Chinese Sung, Korean and Persian pottery. These caught Vyse's interest, and he started experimenting in the Sung style. Nell, who had trained as a singer, had also studied German and French, enabling her to decipher 19th century works on early Chinese glazes and Charles to reproduce chun (an iron glaze used in Chinese celadon ware), tenmoku and T'zu-chou stoneware glazes. Their experiments with oriental glazes established that the blue in celadons was due to iron and not copper as had been thought. Their work was sold at Walker's Gallery in New Bond Street."]}, {"page": "George Francis Hill", "response": ["In 1893, Hill joined the British Museum in the Coins and Medals Department.  At that time, the department was the centre of study of Greek coins. Hill continued the work of Barclay Head and Reginald Poole; in 1897 was published the first volume of a catalogue of Greek coins. Hill subsequently produced catalogues of many of the British Museum's collections in his area. In 1912, he became keeper of the department. In 1931, he was appointed Director and Principal Librarian of the British Museum. Whilst director, he purchased the Codex Sinaiticus from the Soviet Union and, with the Victoria and Albert Museum, the George Eumorfopoulos oriental antiquities collection."]}, {"page": "Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun", "response": ["The figures unearthed in Liu's tomb are representative of a type which has been found in great numbers in urban areas of northwest China. These statues are a symbol of the high status of the person buried within these tombs. This style of ceramic tomb figure is thought to have been fashionable for about fifty years from around 700 AD. The figures were bought by the British Museum from the orientalist George Eumorfopoulos in 1935-6. The price was below the market rate and was reported as a \"princely gesture\" where Eumorfopoulos sold and donated a vast collection to both the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum."]}, {"page": "Oriental Ceramic Society", "response": ["* 1921\u201339 George Eumorfopoulos"]}, {"page": "Robert Lockhart Hobson", "response": ["He was one of the founding members of the Oriental Ceramic Society, and after his retirement, chairman (or president) from 1939 to 1942 in succession to George Eumorfopoulos.
