Williams accompanied Sir Francis Drake in the expedition to Spain and Portugal 1589, and later fought on behalf of the French Huguenots. He met the Earl of Essex in 1589, and the two became close when they were sent by Queen Elizabeth to lead an army as allies of Henry of Navarre against the Catholic League during the Spanish occupation of Brittany in 1592. He went on to serve Henry against the League during the late 1580s and 1590s, scored a major victory at the Battle of Arques.Terry Breverton, \"Williams, Roger\" in Wales: A Historical Companion, Amberley, 2012. After Essex returned to England Williams became overall commander of the English forces supporting Henry and de facto envoy of the Queen.Wagner, John, Historical Dictionary of the Elizabethan World: Britain, Ireland, Europe and America, Routledge, p. 327. Shortly afterwards he captured Aumerle with only 600 men. During the Siege of Rouen in 1592, he almost killed Albanian-Italian leader Giorgio Basta in personal combat, slicing his neck and driving him and his men from the field.Lawrence, David, The Complete Soldier: Military Books and Military Culture in Early Stuart England, 1603\u20131645, Brill, 2009, p. 66. These actions made Williams a famous hero in England, and pamphlets of his exploits were published. Sir Henry Umton stated that King Henry was full of praise for Williams and his men, \"I never heard him give more honour to any service nor to any man than he doth to Sir Roger Williams and the rest\".Motley, John Lothrop, History of the United Netherlands: From the Death of William the Silent to the Twelve Years' Truce \u2013 1609, Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 145."]}, {"page": "Preseli Hills", "response": ["In 2000 Terry Breverton, a lecturer at Cardiff University, in promoting a book he had published, suggested that the rock star Elvis Presley's ancestors came from the Preseli Hills and may have had links to a chapel at St Elvis."]}, {"page": "Brehon", "response": ["The Martyrology of Tallaght lists the feast dates of five principal  Pre-Patrician Christian Saints as being Abb\u00e1n of Moyarny, Ailbe of Emly, Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir, Decl\u00e1n of Ardmore and Ibar of Beggerin. All are said to be originally from Munster and also as being the earliest recorded Christian Saints that had existed in Ireland prior to the arrival of Saint Patrick. Most notable of the five is Ailbe of Emly, he is the patron saint of Munster and also known as St Eilfyw in Wales, where he founded a tiny community called St Elvis in Wales believed to have been one of the smallest parishes to be established in Britain, which is named after him, its just four miles north of the ancient city of St Davids. Its been suggested by certain scholars that it was Saint Ailbe who baptimized Saint David 454 AD at Port Clais in Dyfed. In 2000 Terry Breverton, a lecturer at Cardiff University, while promoting his book, suggested that the rock star Elvis Presley's ancestral roots came from the Celtic prehistoric site of Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire and may have had links to a chapel at St Elvis."]}, {"page": "Ailbe of Emly", "response": ["Late Welsh sourcesp.67 (no.92), p.70 (no. 35) in Bartrum, P.C.(1966): Early Welsh Genealogical Tracts, Cardiff: UWP. give him a British ancestry.
