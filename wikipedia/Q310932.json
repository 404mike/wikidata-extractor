Having worked with many prominent directors, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, Winstone is best known for his \"hard man\" roles (usually delivered in his distinctive London accent). The first of these was the character Carlin in Scum, the 1979 film remake of a BBC television play in which Winstone had originated the role, and which was not broadcast due to its violent nature. The same year he played ex-army soldier Kevin in the cult classic Quadrophenia. In the 1980s he rose to prominence starring as Will Scarlet in the successful television series Robin of Sherwood. \nWinstone has been described as one of the UK's \"seminal screen hard nuts\", while The Guardian has said that he \"plays troubled hard men with such conviction, it's easy to believe he's not acting\", adding that he is \"the East End's answer to George Clooney\". He has appeared in a wide variety of feature films, including Nil by Mouth (1997), Love, Honour and Obey (2000), Ripley's Game (2002), The Magic Roundabout (2005), Beowulf (2007), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), 44 Inch Chest (2009), London Boulevard (2010), Hugo (2011), Point Break (2015), Cats (2019) and Black Widow (2021).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 19", "response": ["*  1957   \u2013 Ray Winstone, English actor"]}, {"page": "H.

The film stars Asa Butterfield, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Christopher Lee, and Jude Law. The film has been met with critical acclaim and earned Scorsese his third Golden Globe Award for Best Director. The film was also nominated for 11 Academy Awards, winning five of them and becoming tied with Michel Hazanavicius's film The Artist for the most Academy Awards won by a single film in 2011. Hugo also won two BAFTA awards, among numerous other awards and nominations. Hugo was Scorsese's first 3D film and was released in the United States on November 23, 2011.", "Scorsese often casts the same actors in his projects, particularly Robert De Niro, who has collaborated with Scorsese on nine feature films and one short film. Included are the three films (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas) that made AFI's 100 Years\u00a0... 100 Movies list. Scorsese has often said he thinks De Niro's best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy. After the turn of the century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor Leonardo DiCaprio, collaborating on five feature films and one short to date. Several critics have compared Scorsese's new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro. Frequent collaborators also include: Victor Argo (6), Harvey Keitel (6), Harry Northup (6), Murray Moston (5), Illeana Douglas (4), J. C. MacKenzie (4), Joe Pesci (4), Frank Vincent (3), Barry Primus (3), and Verna Bloom (3).
