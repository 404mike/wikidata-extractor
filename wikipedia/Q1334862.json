Newton was Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge University from 1866 to 1907. Among his numerous publications were a four-volume Dictionary of Birds (1893\u20136), entries on ornithology in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (9th edition) while also an editor of the journal Ibis from 1865 to 1870. In 1900 he was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society and the Gold Medal of the Linnaean Society. He founded the British Ornithologists Union.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Russel Wallace", "response": ["In 1872, at the urging of many of his friends, including Darwin, Philip Sclater, and Alfred Newton, Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. Initial progress was slow, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux.Slotten p. 301. He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification.Slotten p. 315. Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds\u2014which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution\u2014to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the zoogeographic regions still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographic region."]}, {"page": "Dodo", "response": ["The British ornithologist Alfred Newton suggested in 1868 that the name of the dodo was transferred to the red rail after the former had gone extinct. Cheke also pointed out that some descriptions after 1662 use the names \"Dodo\" and \"Dodaers\" when referring to the red rail, indicating that they had been transferred to it. He therefore pointed to the 1662 description as the last credible observation. A 1668 account by English traveller John Marshall, who used the names \"Dodo\" and \"Red Hen\" interchangeably for the red rail, mentioned that the meat was \"hard\", which echoes the description of the meat in the 1681 account. Even the 1662 account has been questioned by the writer Errol Fuller, as the reaction to distress cries matches what was described for the red rail. Until this explanation was proposed, a description of \"dodos\" from 1681 was thought to be the last account, and that date still has proponents.", "Clark's reports about the finds rekindled interest in the bird. Sir Richard Owen and Alfred Newton both wanted to be first to describe the post-cranial anatomy of the dodo, and Owen bought a shipment of dodo bones originally meant for Newton, which led to rivalry between the two. Owen described the bones in Memoir on the Dodo in October 1866, but erroneously based his reconstruction on the Edwards's Dodo painting by Savery, making it too squat and obese. In 1869 he received more bones and corrected its stance, making it more upright. Newton moved his focus to the R\u00e9union solitaire instead. The remaining bones not sold to Owen or Newton were auctioned off or donated to museums. In 1889, Th\u00e9odor Sauzier was commissioned to explore the \"historical souvenirs\" of Mauritius and find more dodo remains in the Mare aux Songes. He was successful, and also found remains of other extinct species."]}, {"page": "Geneva", "response": ["* Alfred Newton FRS HFRSE (1829\u20131907), English zoologist and ornithologist"]}, {"page": "Thomas Henry Huxley", "response": ["The letters of Alfred Newton include one to his brother giving an eyewitness account of the debate, and written less than a month afterwards.Wollaston AFR 1921.

The society acted as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing.
