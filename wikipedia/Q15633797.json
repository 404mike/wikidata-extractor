He worked on immunizations and antitoxins against diseases, including tetanus and diphtheria, and, later, chemical weapons.\nHis scientific work focused on the mechanisms of antibody production and the prevention of diphtheria. In 1921 he and H. J. S\u00fcdmersen discovered the primary and secondary immune response. In the  same paper they also briefly described the properties of diphtheria toxoid, which had been discovered by Glenny in 1904, apparently by accident. In 1925-6 he developed alum-precipitated diphtheria toxoid.  He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1944 and awarded the Edward Jenner Medal by the Royal Society of Medicine in 1953.\nGlenny died in 1965. He had married Emma Blanche Lillian Gibbs (born 1886) on 7 July 1910. They had three children, John (1913), Peter (1915), and Barbara (1918).", "link_mentions": {}}}
