He majors in writing adventure/psychological horror games such as the Dark Fall series and The Lost Crown. He is the CEO and founder of Darkling Room.The games of Jonathan Boakes are usually designed based on real scenery, then the place is given a fictional name instead of using the real name in the game. One of his works, The Lost Crown, was based on the Polperro harbour, which was renamed as Saxton in the game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dark Fall", "response": ["Dark Fall is a 2002 first-person psychological horror/adventure game developed and independently published for Microsoft Windows by Jonathan Boakes, under the XXv Productions label. After the independent release proved a success, with the game selling well and generating good word-of-mouth, The Adventure Company purchased the rights, releasing it worldwide in 2003 under the title Dark Fall - The Journal. The game was re-released twice in 2009. Firstly, by Boakes' own company, Darkling Room, in a limited \"Pins & Needles\" edition, and later by Iceberg Interactive, as part of their Adventures in Terror: British Horror Collection. The game was made available on Steam in December 2013.", "Dark Fall was written, designed and programmed by Jonathan Boakes, who was working as a sushi chef at the time. He first got the idea for the game whilst exploring a real abandoned train station and adjoining hotel in Dorset in January 2000. The buildings were sealed shut with corrugated iron, but rusted peepholes allowed him to look inside and determine they had been quite opulent in their day, and had last been used in the late 1940s. Upon further investigation, he discovered one of the doors of the train station was so rotted, the weight of the iron had pulled it partly off its hinges, and he was able to get inside and explore the buffet room."]}, {"page": "Dark Fall II: Lights Out", "response": ["Lights Out received mixed reviews, with critics praising Jonathan Boakes' individual work on the game and his obvious passion for the adventure genre. Some also praised the atmosphere and storyline. Common criticisms focused on the game's technical limitations, specifically its graphical presentation, and predictable gameplay. Most critics also felt the game failed to improve on the original Dark Fall.", "As with the original Dark Fall game, Jonathan Boakes worked primarily alone on Lights Out, writing, designing and programming the game, as well as voicing several characters, composing the music and designing the sound effects."]}, {"page": "The Lost Crown: A Ghost-Hunting Adventure", "response": ["The Lost Crown: A Ghost-Hunting Adventure is a British graphic adventure video game released in 2008. The Lost Crown is the third full title to be written and developed by Jonathan Boakes, author of Dark Fall: The Journal and Dark Fall 2: Lights Out. The screenplay follows the adventure of Nigel Danvers, as he experiences the paranormal in his quest to find the fabled Lost Crown of Anglia. The game was followed by The Last Crown: Midnight Horror\"The Last Crown: Blackenrock\" Official Website and The Last Crown: Blackenrock.", "The Lost Crown was written by Jonathan Boakes, between 2005 and late 2007. The story is an exploration of the \u2018classic ghost story\u2019, featuring references to many ghost stories read by the author in childhood. Most notably, M. R. James A Warning to the Curious features many influential elements; the seaside setting, the legend of the lost Anglo-Saxon Crown, a greedy archaeologist and the presence of a ghostly guardian, sworn to protect the whereabouts of the crown, even after death.", "* Interview with Jonathan Boakes at Just Adventure"]}, {"page": "Dark Fall: Lost Souls", "response": ["As with both the original Dark Fall and the sequel, Dark Fall II: Lights Out, Jonathan Boakes worked primarily alone on Lost Souls, writing, designing and programming the game, as well as voicing several characters, designing the sound effects (with Matt Clark), and composing the music (with Ben Gammons). Boakes has said he prefers working on the Dark Fall games without a development team as \"the worlds of Dowerton and Fetch Rock are created from an informed imagination, using textures and sounds from the world around me. I think a little of that personality would be lost if tackled by a small team.\" Of Lost Souls, he felt working alone helped him establish the game's atmosphere of isolation; \"working alone in the dim light of the Darkling Room is the best way to approach this game [...] It's an eerie, isolating experience.\"", "GameZone scored the game 7.5 out of 10, praising the story and the detail of the game's milieu; \"More impressive than the actual story is the way that it's told. Dark Falls creator Jonathan Boakes was able to convey a lot of information using very simple storytelling techniques that fit perfectly within the gloomy world of the game.\" The game's sound design was also singled out for praise. Although they were critical of the obscurity of some of the puzzles, they concluded \"it can be clunky, slow and frustrating, but offers up some better storytelling than many games with a hundred times the development budget. Sure, its clich\u00e9d at times. But it's also genuinely creepy and compelling.\"", "Adventure Gamers' Nathaniel Berens also scored it 4 out of 5, calling it \"easily one of the scariest point-and-click adventures ever.\" He praised the game's dark atmosphere, and the graphical improvements over the first two games, especially the introduction of 360 degree panoramic navigation, higher resolution options and anti-aliasing capabilities. His main criticism concerned the plot, to which he referred as \"all over the place.\" However, he concluded \"in the end, I walked away from the game satisfied. There are few designers in the industry today that can match Jonathan Boakes' ability to conjure a location so fully and convincingly, populate it with texture and history, and then use it to scare the bejeezus out of you.\""]}, {"page": "Boakes, Jonathan", "response": ["#redirectJonathan Boakes"]}]}}
