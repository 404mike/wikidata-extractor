He continued to produce a good display throughout the club's pre\u2013season tour in a number of matches. Wallace made his league debut for Burnley, starting the whole game, in a 1\u20130 win over Nottingham Forest in the opening game of the season. Two weeks later on 21 August 2010, he scored his first goal for the club and set up a goal for Chris Iwelumo in a 3\u20130 win over Leicester City. Facing against his former club, Preston North End on 11 September 2010, Wallace played a key role in the match when he set up the opener for Iwelumo and a winning goal for Jay Rodriguez in a 4\u20133 win. After missing a match, due to a groin injury, Wallace found his playing time, coming from the substitute bench, due to competitions in the midfield position. Despite this, he was able to score his second goal for Burnley, in a 3\u20132 win against Watford on 13 November 2010. On 3 January 2011, Wallace scored his third goal for the club, in a 2\u20131 loss against Reading. By January, he found himself in and out of the starting line\u2013up for the rest of the 2010\u201311 season. At the end of the 2010\u201311 season, Wallace went on to make forty\u2013three appearances and scoring three times in all competitions.", "In the opening game of the 2011\u201312 season, Wallace helped Burnley when he helped the club draw 2\u20132 draw by setting up a goal for Keith Treacy. This was followed up by scoring his first goal of the season and setting up a goal for Jay Rodriguez, who went on to score four goals, in a 6\u20133 win against Burton Albion in the first round of the League Cup. Since the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Wallace became a first team regular for the club when he started out, playing in the left\u2013wing position. Wallace then began rotating into playing different positions, starting out in the right\u2013midfield position and left\u2013back position.  He then scored his second goal of the season, scoring from 20 yards, in a 5\u20131 win against Nottingham Forest on 27 September 2011. This was followed up by setting up a goal for Rodriguez to score the only goal of the game, in a 1\u20130 win against Millwall. From 22 October 2011 to 5 November 2011, Wallace scored four goals in four consecutive games for Burnley. Wallace also started in every match until he missed a match against Leeds United on 19 November 2011, due to picking up an injury in training. Wallace then returned to the starting line\u2013up against Birmingham City three days later on 22 November 2011, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20131 loss. However, his return was short\u2013lived when he missed one match for picking up five yellow cards this season. After serving a one match suspension, Wallace returned to the first team against West Ham United on 3 December 2011, coming on as a 58th-minute substitute, and set up the winning goal for Sam Vokes, in a 2\u20131 win. Following this, he became the club's most consistent performer for the rest of the 2011\u201312 season, providing nine assists. At the end of the 2011\u201312 season, Wallace went on to make forty\u2013four appearances and scoring six times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Ade Akinbiyi", "response": ["During the rest of the 2006\u201307 season, Akinbiyi was not as successful as during his first spell at Turf Moor, scoring three goals. This was attributed by Steve Cotterill to Akinbiyi having spent too much time in the weights room at Sheffield United and as a result being too bulky. He was given the number nine shirt for the 2007\u201308 season but found himself behind Andy Gray and Robbie Blake as a first choice striker. After going back to Burnley, Akinbiyi lacked consistent form, finding goals harder to come by. His hard work and endeavour made him a firm fans' favourite. During the 2008\u201309 season, his regular position on the bench was taken by youngster Jay Rodriguez, a player who he had been mentoring. However, Akinbiyi regained his place on the bench in the fifth round of the League Cup against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and in the 69th minute he scored to make the game 1\u20131 and take it into extra time. Burnley won 5\u20134 on penalties. While at Burnley, Steve Cotterill, Burnley's then manager, banned him from the gym. \"I wasn't playing at Sheffield so the only thing I was doing was weights. We didn't even have reserve games and it was something to do. I put on a bit too much muscle and I lost about a yard of pace\", he said. \"I try to stay away from the weights room now. I'm sort of addicted.\""]}, {"page": "Rickie Lambert", "response": ["He scored on his very first Premier League appearance, scoring just minutes after replacing Jay Rodriguez as a substitute against Manchester City. This goal meant that Lambert joined a select group of players who have scored in all four league divisions. He followed this up with the opening goal in a match against Manchester United. He later grabbed two goals in Southampton's first league win of the season, a 4\u20131 victory over Aston Villa. His 10th Premier League goal came in a 2\u20132 draw at Chelsea, with Lambert getting the first goal as Southampton came back from 2\u20130 down. He had only been on the pitch for a matter of minutes. He scored his 100th Southampton goal in a defeat at Newcastle United, which was his 12th goal of the season. On 21 March 2013 Lambert signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him with the Saints until summer 2016.

However, his first team opportunities at the club was limited, due to Markus Suttner being preferred at the first choice left\u2013back position, as well as, his own injury concern. He made his Premier League debut in a 2\u20130 away defeat against Arsenal on 1 October 2017. He started for Albion in their next five league games as they embarked on an unbeaten run that saw the club reach as high as 8th place in the Premier League. On 25 November 2017, Bong was involved in an incident with Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku in Brighton's 1\u20130 league defeat at Old Trafford, where Lukaku attempted to kick Bong twice in Brighton's penalty area. Lukaku ultimately did not face retrospective action for the incident, with referee Neil Swarbrick's report confirming that he had not seen the incident, but the FA panel could not reach a unanimous verdict. For the next months, he found himself in and out of the first team, due to his own injury concern once again. Bong accused Jay Rodriguez of making a racist remark during a 2\u20130 defeat at West Bromwich Albion on 13 January 2018. The West Brom forward was charged by the Football Association on 8 February in relation to the incident. The charges were later found not proven by the F.A. due to lack of evidence, but the FA was \"completely satisfied\" Bong's complaint was \"made in absolute good faith\" and \"there has been no suggestion that this was a malicious or fabricated complaint\". Amid to the incident, Bong regained his first team place from Suttner for the left\u2013back position for the rest of the season. On 28 February 2018, Bong signed a one-year contract extension, committing him to Brighton until 30 June 2019. During a 0\u20130 draw against Burnley on 28 April 2018, he was booed by Burnley's supporters, chanting \"Jay Rodriguez (who used to play for Burnley), he's one of our own\" and booing him whenever he touched the ball. After the match, Manager Chris Hughton, the FA and anti-racist organisation Kick It Out condemned the actions from Burnley's supporters. On 4 May 2018, Bong played in the 1\u20130 home win over Manchester United which secured The Albion's Premier League survival with two games remaining, as well as, keeping another clean sheet.

Burnley could only progress by winning by three clear goals and it was widely seen as unlikely that Burnley would offer much in terms of opposition. After 90 minutes, however, goals from Robbie Blake, Chris McCann and Jay Rodriguez took the game to extra time and if they held on they would progress thanks to the away goals rule, but facing elimination with under three minutes left to play, goals from Roman Pavlyuchenko and Jermain Defoe saw Spurs progress to the final 6\u20134 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["In the third round, a Fulham side featuring the attacking talents of Johnson, Gera and Dempsey lost 1\u20130 to a Burnley side who had been performing well and sitting in the play-off positions in the Championship.

He collected a Chris Eagles through ball just inside the area and then slotted the ball past Pascal Zuberb\u00fchler. Fulham were therefore knocked out of the competition."]}]}}
