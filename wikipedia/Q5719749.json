Named for its first modern owner, Henry Constantine Jennings, it is a 2nd-century AD Roman copy of a Hellenistic bronze original. The original was probably of the 2nd century BC. It is  high; its leonine muzzle and one leg have been repaired since its rediscovery.  Though it is one of only a few animal sculptures surviving from antiquity, a pair of similar marble mastiffs of the same model can be seen in the Belvedere Court of the Vatican Museums.One illustrated in Aelius Stilo, \"Molossian: The Jennings Dog\"", "The stone sculpture was discovered at Monte Cagnuolo, near the ancient Lanuvium, the site of an imperial villa of Antoninus Pius, 32\u00a0km southeast of Rome,The tradition of its place of discovery, reported by James Dalloway, author of Anecdotes of the Arts in England (1800), was noted in T. Whellan, History and Topography of the City of York: and the North Riding Volume 2, 1859:250. where it was probably made; its first modern owner was the sculptor, restorer and dealer in antiquities Bartolomeo Cavaceppi.  Henry Constantine Jennings saw it in a pile of rubble in Cavaceppi's workshop in Rome between 1753 and 1756, bought it from him for 400 scudi, and took it back to Britain."]}, {"page": "English translations of Dante's Divine Comedy", "response": ["* Dante Alighieri: Divine Comedy.
