He has released four albums of mainly original material which fall loosely into the folk/roots category.  Carter is the winner of the \"Horizon\" award for best newcomer at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2010. Highly regarded as an instrumentalist, contemporary Jon Boden of Bellowhead described him as 'the finest English-style finger-picking guitarist of his generation, and former BBC Radio Two folk show presenter Mike Harding wrote that Carter was \"one of the most gifted acoustic guitarists of his generation.\". As a songwriter, Carter marries a traditionally English narrative style with elements of American gospel, shapenote, R&B and folk-rock has been described as an \"impressively original\" performer. Some commentators consider that Carter's guitar and vocal style is similar to that of noted British iconoclasts John Martyn and Roy Harper, whilst his lyrical perspective has further invited comparison with the work of Richard Thompson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sandy Denny", "response": ["The band was, once again, composed of members of Bellowhead.
