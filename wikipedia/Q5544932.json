The addition of two wings in 1705 are attributed to John Meadows, who also worked on Eggesford House and Arlington, on which commission he died. A fine interior exists and has examples from the 'Gothik' work of Batty Langley. The main ranges of the house were taken down to the level of the cloisters and rebuilt in the Strawberry Hill Gothic style, made popular by Lord Walpole. Further alterations were commissioned by Sir George Stucley in the mid-1800s. He engaged George Gilbert Scott and the building was remodelled to give a formal entrance through a new porch on the north end. Two bay windows were installed on the east frontage. Internally the drawing room and dining rooms were presented in a style similar to that found in the Palace of Westminster, each having fine wall panelling (Elizabethan in the dining room & entrance, linenfold in the drawing room). both rooms have a series of painted murals by Alfred Beer of Exeter around the walls. These depict events in English and Irish history in which Sir George Stucley felt his ancestors were engaged. Alfred Beer was also commissioned to make the fine painted glass wedding window on the staircase. Sir George had the main passage decorated in a style and colours to represent the Alhambra Palace style which he had recently visited. Gilbert Scott engaged Richard Coad as his supervising architect on these improvements and the contractor was Pulsman of Barnstaple.Country Life 1983"]}, {"page": "Sir George Stucley, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Stucley"]}, {"page": "Stucley", "response": ["*George Stucley, 1st Baronet (1812\u20131900), a British Conservative Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "North Devon Militia", "response": ["*(30 July 1846\u20131853) Sir George Stucley Buck Stucley, 1st Baronet (1812\u20131900) (known as George Buck until 1858), of Affeton, Moreton House, Bideford and Hartland Abbey.
