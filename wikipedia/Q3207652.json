Simon Mensing converted a penalty to put Hamilton 1\u20130 up, and Richard Offiong completed the scoring. However, Offiong was later sent off following two bookable offences. On Tuesday 13th, Aberdeen traveled to Ayr, to play December's postponement against Kilmarnock. Killie took the lead when the ball fell nicely to Allan Russell who finished well. Aberdeen equalised on the half-hour, when Lee Miller met Mulgrew's corner fantastically, scoring with a back-heel volley. And it was Miller who grabbed the winner, when he met Mackie's cross with a diving header. Aberdeen won the game 2\u20131 and that moved Aberdeen up to fourth. Aberdeen were to host both sides of the Old Firm in the space of two weeks, up first were Celtic, a team who Aberdeen have never beaten at Pittodrie since 2002. The game turned out to be a classic. Stuart Duff crossed the ball for Gary McDonald to open the scoring with a looping header. Celtic were back on level terms within a minute, as a cut-back by Aiden McGeady found Scott Brown unmarked to score the equaliser. Duff then got on the score-sheet himself, with a well taken volley. After immense pressure from Celtic in the second half, Scott McDonald pulled Celtic back on level terms again when he headed in Barry Robson's cross. However, Aberdeen were not to be denied the win, as Zander Diamond headed in two Charlie Mulgrew free-kicks in the space of two minutes to give the Dons' a 4\u20132 win against the reigning champions. The crowd were left chanting for five. The following week, a packed Pittodrie watched Aberdeen take on the second half of the Old Firm, Rangers. A dull game saw very little chances until in the 80th minute Nacho Novo found space at the back post, but his shot rebounded off of the post. Darren Mackie and Charlie Mulgrew went close for Aberdeen, but both defences stayed firm as the sides settled for a 0\u20130 draw. Aberdeen then travelled to Falkirk.
