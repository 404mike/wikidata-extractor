He was born at South Ruislip, Middlesex.\nHerting was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a left-arm fast-medium bowler. He played a lot of cricket for Somerset's second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship and the Second Eleven Championship from 1956, but his first-class career was restricted to just five matches in mid-season in 1960. In the first of these, against Gloucestershire at Bath, he took four first-innings wickets for 85 runs. But in his four other matches he took only three further wickets, and he did not play for Somerset again after the 1960 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Fred Herting (1960) 5 matches CA"]}]}}
