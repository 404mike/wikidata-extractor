Torquay United, The Official Centenary History, 1899-1999. Yore Publications.   Womack soon set about putting a together a new squad in an effort to improve upon the lowly finishes of Torquay's first two seasons in the League.  Debutants on the opening day of the season included centre half Harry Bruce, inside forward Harry Keeling and the ex-Sheffield United FA Cup winner David Mercer.  However, the Magpies made a slow start to the campaign, losing their opening four games, and it was not until the introduction of forwards Joe Pointon and Les Robinson that results slowly began to improve.  Effectively displacing Keeling and United mainstay Dan Kelly from the team, Pointon and Robinson ended up scoring a total of 34 goals between them by the end of the season.  Robinson became the first Torquay player to score four goals in a League match in the 5\u20132 win over Walsall in November and, not to be outdone, Pointon repeated the feat in a famous 7\u20130 victory over Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic the following March.  Indeed, it was Pointon and Robinson who scored the goals at Gillingham to secure Torquay's first and only away win of the season.Edwards, Leigh (1997). The Definitive Torquay United F.C..
