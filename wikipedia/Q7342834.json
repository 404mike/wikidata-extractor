By then, Chrissie has grown concerned over Vicki's boyfriend Tommy Grant (Robert Cavanah) and especially since he is much older than her; Chrissie soon exposes Tommy as a liar and threatens to do him harm should he ever resume her relationship with Vicki, and he obliges to her demands. Den thereafter returns and plans to reconcile with Chrissie, but she not succumb to his charm offensive and continues to dismiss him. Chrissie soon reconsiders, however, when Den confines to her about his plan to bankrupt local businesswoman Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) and her family from their ownership of The Queen Victoria public house; Den continues to explain that his intent on doing this, aside from settling the Mitchell and Watts family feud in favor of the latter, is because he and Sharon used to live happily together in The Queen Vic for over a decade and so he wishes to make amends for both of them \u2014 further stating to Chrissie that he cannot go through with this without her support. Chrissie eventually relents and agrees to help her husband accomplish his plot against the Mitchells, but then tells Den that she will kill him if he ever cheats on her again; Den seemingly accepts her word. Together, the couple successfully defraud Sam from everything her family owns around the square by blackmailing her lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett) into conspiring with them against the Mitchells.
