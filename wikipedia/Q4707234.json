Alan Manning ran for office as an Australian Labor Party candidate three times, losing on each try. Manning's ALP affiliation did not sit well with others in rural Coonabarabran. The Manning family was eventually removed from their family farm by the ownership trust for \"spending too much time in politics.\" Alan Manning and other ALP dissenters were expelled from the political party in 1956 after openly criticizing the \"36 faceless men\" of the ALP federal executive. In response to his expulsion, Alan Manning, a Protestant, joined the Democratic Labor Party, which was dominated by Catholics.

Krueger's re-evaluation of the employment effects of the minimum wage, Stephen Machin (with Alan Manning) conducted research in the U.K. on the subject. In general, they find that the decrease in the ratio between Britain's minimum wage and its average wage significantly contributed to growing wage dispersion in the 1980s but didn't increase employment, which in turn suggests that - with the possible exception of young workers - the minimum wage had either no or a small positive effect on employment.Machin, S., Manning, A. (1994). The effects of minimum wages on wage dispersion and employment: Evidence from the UK Wages Councils. ILR Review, 47(2), pp. 319-329. They further argue that this finding extends to other European countries for 1966-1996 and is in line with monopsonistic models of labour demand.Dolado, J. et al. (1996). The economic impact of minimum wages in Europe. Economic Policy, 11(23), pp. 317-372.Dickens, R., Machin, S., Manning, A. (1999).

Therein, together with Fabbri and Preston, Dustmann finds that while immigration in Britain overall doesn't appear to have an effect on British natives' employment, labour force participation, unemployment, and wages, immigration in fact likely decreased the employment of medium-skilled natives and increased that of high-skilled natives.Dustmann, C., Fabbri, F., Preston, I. (2005). The Impact of Immigration on the British Labour Market. Economic Journal, 115(507), pp. 324-341. In further work with Albrecht Glitz and Tommaso Frattini, Dustmann studies how European countries' labour markets adjusted to recent immigration through changes in factor prices, output mix and production technology.Dustmann, D., Glitz, A., Frattini, T. (2008). The labour market impact of immigration. Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 24(3), pp. 478-495. This research is further complemented by work with Glitz, Yann Algan and Alan Manning that compares the performance of first- and second-generation immigrants in France, Germany and the UK in terms of education, earnings and employment,Algan, Y. et al. (2010). The Economic Situation of First and Second-Generation Immigrants in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Economic Journal, 120(542), pp. 4-30. as well as by research with Frattini and Gianandrea Lanzara which shows that even though second-generation immigrants tend to perform worse than natives in terms of education, immigration has a strongly positive on their education relative to that of their peers in their home country.Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Lanzara, G. (2012). Educational achievement of second-generation immigrants: an international comparison. Economic Policy, 27(69), pp. 143-185. More recently, Dustmann, Frattini and Caroline Halls have also analyzed the fiscal effects of immigration in the UK, finding that European immigrants in general and especially immigrants from post-2004 EU Member States have made consistently positive contributions to the UK's public finances between 1995 and 2011, though the opposite holds true for non-EEA immigrants, in particular before 2000.Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Halls, C. (2010). Assessing the Fiscal Costs and Benefits of A8 Migration to the UK. Fiscal Studies, 31(1), pp. 1-41.Dustmann, C., Frattini, T. (2014). The Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK. Economic Journal, 124(580), pp. 593-643. Finally, together with Frattini and Preston, Dustmann finds that immigrants' move to the UK generally results in a considerable downgrade of their position within the wage distribution, which then in turns depresses slightly wages among the bottom fifth of native workers but increases wages for the upper half.Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Preston, I.P. (2013). The Effect of Immigration along the Distribution of Wages. Review of Economic Studies, 80(1), pp. 145-173."]}, {"page": "Yann Algan", "response": ["* In France, (Germany) and the UK, the gap between natives and immigrants in terms of educational achievement decreases over generations, though overall in all three countries the labour market performance of most immigrant groups as well as their descendants is generally worse than that of natives, even if differences in education, regional allocation and experience are taken into account (with Christian Dustmann, Albrecht Glitz and Alan Manning).Algan, Y. et al.
