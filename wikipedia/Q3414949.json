Dick\" (taking the initials from her sea captain father, Robert Abercromby). She most famously wrote the 1945 novel The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, which was made into a 1947 film and adapted for a 1960s TV series.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir", "response": ["Variety, on the other hand, praised the actors and the film unreservedly: \u201cGene Tierney gives what undoubtedly is her best performance to date. It\u2019s warmly human... the out-of-this-world romance pulls audience sympathy with an infectious tug that never slackens. In his role as the lusty, seafaring shade, Rex Harrison commands the strongest attention...Philip Dunne\u2019s script lards the R. A. Dick novel with gusty humor and situations that belie the ghostly theme. Dialog makes full use of salty expressions to point up chuckles.\u201d"]}]}}
