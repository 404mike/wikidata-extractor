When early works were banned by Soviet censors, P\u00e4rt entered the first of several periods of contemplative silence, during which he studied choral music from the 14th to 16th centuries. In this context, P\u00e4rt's biographer, Paul Hillier, observed that \"he had reached a position of complete despair in which the composition of music appeared to be the most futile of gestures, and he lacked the musical faith and willpower to write even a single note.\"P.
