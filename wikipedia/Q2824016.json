Sayer, a M\u00e9tis trapper and trader, was accused of illegal trading in furs. The Court of Assiniboia brought Sayer to trial, before a jury of HBC officials and supporters. During the trial, a crowd of armed M\u00e9tis men led by Louis Riel, Sr. gathered outside the courtroom. Although Sayer was found guilty of illegal trade, having evaded the HBC monopoly, Judge Adam Thom did not levy a fine or punishment. Some accounts attributed that to the intimidating armed crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre! (\"Trade is free! Trade is free!\"), the M\u00e9tis loosened the HBC's previous control of the courts, which had enforced their monopoly on the settlers of Red River."]}, {"page": "Rupert's Land", "response": ["In 1839 the Hudson's Bay Company were convinced of the need to dispense formal justice throughout Rupert's Land and established a court at the Red River Colony, in the \"District of Assiniboia\", south of Lake Winnipeg. A Recorder and President of the Court would act as legal organizer, adviser, magistrate, and councillor and be responsible for the rationalization and formalization of Rupert's Land's judicial system. The first Recorder was Adam Thom, who held the post until 1854, although relieved of most of his duties by his deputy some years before. He was succeeded as President of the Court from 1862 to 1870 by John Black."]}, {"page": "Doric Club", "response": ["The Doric Club was an association of Loyals set up in Lower Canada by Adam Thom, a lawyer and journalist, in March 1836. A noted opponent of the Patriotes, the group was both a social club and a paramilitary organization. It was used as the armed faction of the Constitutional Party and many of its members took part in the Lower Canada Rebellions of 1837 and 1838 on the British side."]}, {"page": "Eden Colvile", "response": ["In August 1850, he arrived in the Red River Colony with his wife, Anne Maxwell. They took up residence in the \"Big House\" at Lower Fort Garry.  He quickly took charge of the affairs of the colony.  He took over as president of the Council of Assiniboia, removed Adam Thom from his position of power, and arranged a compromise between the Presbyterians and Anglicans.  Solving the difficulties which arose from the Foss-Pelly slander trial took more delicate maneuvering, but he succeeded by removing the major players in the trial from the Settlement.  After accomplishing the tasks he was sent to fix, he and his wife returned to England in 1852."]}, {"page": "Guillaume Sayer", "response": ["Sayer was backed by M\u00e9tis leader Louis Riel Sr.. On the day of the trial, a crowd of armed M\u00e9tis men gathered outside the courtroom, ready to support their M\u00e9tis brother. They demanded for Sayer to be tried by a jury of his own choosing and to be allowed to take fellow M\u00e9tis into the court with him. Although he was allowed to select a jury of his own, he was still found guilt. Judge Adam Thom, under immense pressure from the overwhelming number of armed M\u00e9tis, levied no fine or punishment. With the cry, \"Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre!\" (\"Free Trade! Free Trade!\"), the HBC could no longer use the courts to enforce their monopoly on the settlers of Red River. In 1870 the trade monopoly was abolished, and trade in the region was opened to any entrepreneur.  The company relinquished its ownership of Rupert's Land under the Rupert's Land Act 1868 enacted by the Canadian Parliament.", "*Stubbs, Roy St. George. \u201cAdam Thom\u201d in Four Recorders of Rupert\u2019s Land.
