Two scenes show naked women, one of whom is being raped and strangled; Donald Spoto called the latter \"one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film\". Both actors, Barbara Leigh-Hunt and Anna Massey, refused to do the scenes, so models were used instead. Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool Joseph Breen, the head of the Motion Picture Production Code. Hitchcock would add subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet Patrick McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such material and were actually amused, as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's \"inescapable inferences\"."]}, {"page": "The Importance of Being Earnest", "response": ["There have been many radio versions of the play.

John O'Connor of The New York Times lauded the serial as a \"splendid adaptation, with a remarkably faithful and sensitively nuanced script\". He commented on Jennifer Ehle's ability to make Elizabeth \"strikingly intelligent and authoritative without being overbearing\", and noted how Firth \"brilliantly captures Mr Darcy's snobbish pride while conveying, largely through intense stares, that he is falling in love despite himself\".
