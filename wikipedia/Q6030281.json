The band is composed of singer Brett Anderson, guitarist Richard Oakes, bass player Mat Osman, drummer Simon Gilbert and keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Neil Codling.", "Brett Anderson and Justine Frischmann met in 1988 while studying at University College London and became a couple soon afterwards.Harris, p. 28-30 Together with Anderson's childhood friend Mat Osman, they decided they had the core of a band, and spent hours a day playing songs by Roxy Music, The Smiths, David Bowie and The Cure.Harris, p. 32 After deciding that neither Anderson nor Frischmann had the skill to be a lead guitarist, the band placed an advert in NME in the magazine's 28 October 1989 issue seeking to fill the position: \"Young guitar player needed by London based band. Smiths, Commotions, Bowie, Pet Shop Boys. No Musos. Some things are more important than ability. Call Brett.\" The advert attracted the interest of nineteen-year-old Bernard Butler, who soon auditioned to join the band.Barnett, p. 32 The band settled on the name Suede. Lacking a drummer, the band initially used a drum machine.Harris, p. 34-35 Despite Frischmann's efforts as the band's de facto manager, the band primarily played small-scale gigs around Camden Town in London.Harris, p. 35", "In the autumn of 1995, the band was joined by new member Neil Codling, a cousin of Gilbert who played keyboards and second guitar. His first appearance was at a fanclub gig at the Hanover Grand on 27 January 1996, which turned out to be one of Suede's most important gigs. A short set devoid of Butler songs was well received by critics, \"A set that says. 'No Need',\" observed Steve Sutherland in NME.Barnett, p. 195 Even before Dog Man Star was released, bassist Mat Osman told Select magazine in September 1994 that he wanted to move on from the regimented recording process and expansive multi-layered guitar sounds of that era and focus on more radio-friendly pop music; citing \"Losing My Religion\" by R.E.M. as a song that \"doesn't show off in the slightest and is still brilliant.\" Anderson had a similar outlook, saying that in contrast to the band's previous albums, which he felt \"suffered at certain times from being quite obscure,\" he intended the forthcoming album to be \"almost like a 'greatest hits'.\" Suede's third album, Coming Up, was released September 1996 and was preceded by the successful lead single, \"Trash\" in July. The single was popular and tied with \"Stay Together\" as the band's highest-charting UK single, reaching number three. The album would become the band's biggest mainstream success, earning the band five straight top-10 singles and becoming a hit throughout Europe, Asia and Canada. Coming Up never did win an audience in America, partially because it appeared nearly a year after its initial release and partially because Suede only supported it with a three-city tour. The tour was not helped by problems in Boston, Massachusetts, in which the band's music equipment was stolen, leaving them to play remaining shows with acoustic guitars. Nevertheless, the album topped the UK chart and became the band's biggest-selling release, setting expectations high for the follow-up. With the success of the album, Suede secured top billing at the 1997 Reading Festival. Suede's next release was Sci-Fi Lullabies, a collection of B-sides, which reached number nine on the UK Album Chart. The compilation was well-received, with disc one of two being described by critics as the band's strongest collection of songs.", "Although the band began work with Tony Hoffer producing, the album was produced by Stephen Street (The Smiths, Blur). Overall, seven different recording studios and four producers were used during the two years spent recording A New Morning, with costs estimated at around \u00a31\u00a0million. The album was a commercial disappointment which failed to enter the top 20 and it was never released in the US. A New Morning sharply divided fans of the band even more so than Head Music and critical reaction was decidedly lukewarm. Furthermore, the mainstream public interest had long disappeared. Only two singles, \"Positivity\" and \"Obsessions\", were released, the fewest singles taken from any of the band's albums, and neither charted particularly well. Anderson has since stressed his disappointment with Suede's final album, stating \"We made one Suede album too many. 'A New Morning' is the only one I don't believe in as much as the other Suede records and I totally believed in the first four, even 'Head Music' which divided the fans.\" Mat Osman told journalist Jon Cronshaw in October 2013 that: \"It sounded like a Suede album that had been made by a committee \u2013 it was quite bland. We\u2019re all quite ashamed of it\". Anderson went further in his criticism in 2016, saying: \"It\u2019s a poor record and we should never have released it.\"", "*Mat Osman \u2013 bass (1989\u20132003, 2010\u2013present)", " bar:Mat text:\"Mat Osman\""]}, {"page": "Haywards Heath", "response": ["* Mat Osman, Suede bassist, attended Oathall School and Haywards Heath Sixth Form College"]}, {"page": "Mark E.

After Suede disbanded in 2003, he briefly fronted The Tears in 2004, and released four solo albums in which he also played guitar and keyboards. Anderson is known for his distinctive wide-ranging voice, poetic lyrics, energetic and charismatic stage presence and, during Suede's early days, an androgynous appearance. Suede reformed in 2010 and continue to record and tour. Bassist Mat Osman and Anderson are the remaining original members since the band's inception.", "In his teens, Anderson played guitar for garage bands such as The Pigs and Geoff, the latter featuring future Suede bassist Mat Osman. In the late 1980s, while a student at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College, London, Anderson and Osman formed Suede with Anderson's girlfriend, Justine Frischmann, soon recruiting guitarist Bernard Butler through an advertisement in the NME. After they had received temporary percussional help from former Smiths drummer Mike Joyce, in 1991 Simon Gilbert joined as their official drummer. It was around this time that Frischmann left Anderson for Blur frontman Damon Albarn, which created an early rift in the burgeoning Britpop scene of the early 1990s. After missing too many rehearsals and flaunting her relationship with Albarn while still living with Anderson, Frischmann was fired from the group, going on to front Elastica.", "In May 2006, Anderson announced details of a solo album consisting of 11 tracks, which was released on 26 March 2007. He told NME that the title would be Brett Anderson since \"...that's my name, you see.\" The accompanying video for Anderson's first single \"Love Is Dead\" debuted on UK television in February 2007, quickly finding its way to YouTube. \"Love Is Dead\" made its debut at No. 42 in the UK singles chart, and the album went to No. 54 the following week. The keyboardist-producer on his album is Fred Ball, and former Suede bass player Mat Osman joined the live band on tour."]}, {"page": "Suede (album)", "response": ["The record was produced by Ed Buller who the band had met through Nude Records' owner Saul Galpern. Both had worked together at Island Records. The band chose to work with Buller not based on his CV but more on a collective liking of him based on a shared interest of music they liked growing up. The band felt that this mutual interest would help shape their musical direction. Lead singer Brett Anderson said: \"It wasn't so much us attaching ourselves to his CV, it was more kind of like where we were going to go with [the band].\" In terms of writing for the album, Anderson said they had a structural way of doing it. Guitarist Bernard Butler would write guitar parts and melodies mostly on his own. He would then play these in the rehearsal room with bassist Mat Osman and drummer Simon Gilbert playing along. Anderson would then create vocal lines, which he would work on at home changing them to lyrics. These early recordings were done on a cassette recorder rather than a 4-track recorder. 4-track recorders would later be used during recording sessions for the album. During the early recordings, Butler said he was never fully aware of what lyrics Anderson was actually singing in rehearsals or at gigs until much later on. He was more focused on the melodies he was writing himself, saying: \"I just always had the feeling that, if he's happy, I'm happy... if it's working, it's working and just go with it.\"", "*Mat Osman \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Coming Up (album)", "response": ["Buller explained how the recording process worked: \"Basically, what we did, is that every track started with acoustic guitar, bongos, tambourine and Brett [Anderson], so it all started life pretty much the same way that Marc Bolan recorded all of his stuff originally.\" Bass player Mat Osman recalls how Buller was keen on making the album simple. \"He was really keen on using all those devices: the big repeated end, the handclaps, the straightforward chorus, make it big and obvious.\" In an interview on the eve of the album's release, Anderson stated: \"I wanted it to be a complete turnover from the last album, which was very dark and dank\u00a0... I wanted it to be communicative and understandable.\" Two songs which made it onto Coming Up had already been written in the early days of Suede. \"Lazy\" and \"By the Sea\" were two of Anderson's own compositions. \"By the Sea\" was actually written when Suede were recording their first album, which is why the song's opening line is similar to \"So Young\". Unlike the tense and chaotic recording of Dog Man Star, which according to Anderson was mostly written \"by post\", in a shift-like format, the new material was far more celebratory in both its development and execution.", "*Mat Osman \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Dog Man Star", "response": ["The album was recorded between 22 March and 26 July 1994 at Master Rock Studios, Kilburn, London. The rehearsals were very tense and would inevitably split the band into two separate camps. Butler had his own agenda, and he frequently clashed with the rest of the band and producer Ed Buller, over whom he had concerns during the recording of the first album. According to Buller, Butler and the rest of the band were not in the studio together once during recording, perhaps only for a matter of hours. Butler seemed to antagonise his bandmates further when he appeared on the front cover of Vox magazine under the tag line \"Brett drives me insane.\" In a rare interview, in that he only ever would do press interviews on the pretext it was about guitars, he said of Anderson: \"He's not a musician at all. It's very difficult for him to get around anything that isn't ABC.\" A despondent Anderson remembers reading the article the same morning he was recording the vocals for \"The Asphalt World\": \"I remember trying to channel all this hurt that I was feeling and the iciness I was feeling into the vocal.\" Butler later apologised to Anderson over the incident. Musical differences over \"The Asphalt World\" triggered the next dispute. The version that made it on to the album lasts for nine minutes 25 seconds, but according to bass player Mat Osman, Butler's initial creation was a 25-minute piece with an eight-minute guitar solo.", "Promotion for the album took place in a somewhat lukewarm atmosphere. With the departure of one half of the song-writing partnership, fans and the music press had assumed that the band were finished. Anderson and the remaining members were determined to continue on as normal and conducted press interviews to get the message across that the band were looking for a new guitarist; and that they were staying together, as Suede was the only thing they ever truly believed in. Promotion for the album started one month before its scheduled release with the band conducting interviews with the UK and American music press. The band recruited new guitarist Richard Oakes mid-September after hearing a tape of him playing \"My Insatiable One\" that he had sent to the band's fanclub. Lead single \"We Are the Pigs\" was released 12 September peaking at 18 in the UK. The choice of lead single had been a subject of debate, with Sony pressuring Anderson to release \"New Generation\" first for commercial reasons. He was unwavering on the matter, putting his artistic beliefs ahead of business sense as he felt \"We Are the Pigs\" had the \"drama and power\" that represented the album's message. He recalled: \"I'd mis-read people's perception of the song. I'd lost my perspective on reality.\" Bassist Mat Osman felt \"The Wild Ones\" should have been the first single, and said releasing \"We Are the Pigs\" was \"commercial suicide.\" The single was performed 22 September on Top of the Pops where Oakes made his first TV performance.

Anderson began to associate himself with people outside the band's social circles, whom the band, especially Mat Osman, seemed to dislike. \"More than anything there started to be a whole load of people he was associating with who I just couldn't stand. They had nothing to do with the band, nothing to do with anything but drugs. They were drug buddies.\"", "As a joke, the group originally started to leak the album's title to the press one letter at a time. But two days after releasing the second letter, bassist Mat Osman announced the album's title and explained where the idea of releasing the title one letter at a time come from: \"Saul [Galpern], head of Nude was hassling for a title, and Brett said, 'I'll tell you one letter at a time until you can guess it.\" After the first two letters were revealed, there was speculation that the title was going to be called Heroin. The artwork, which features Anderson's girlfriend Sam, and Neil Codling, was art-directed by Peter Saville and designed by Howard Wakefield and Paul Hetherington. Anderson told Saville \"I wanted two people joined at the head, sort of listening to each other's heads.

Three UK shows in Glasgow, Manchester, London; and three Scandinavia shows in Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen. The band took part in a live webcast of tracks from the final mixing session direct from their studio on 1 March. Fans were invited to take part in a web chat, view exclusive footage from the studio and listen to the new songs at Suede's official website. On 22 March, the band played their first live show since the 1997 Reading Festival at the first of six fanclub shows at The Garage in Glasgow. Making the most of the friendly fanclub show to focus solely on the forthcoming album, the fourteen track setlist consisted mostly of songs from Head Music and missed out old favourites, with the exception of some Coming Up era b-sides. Mat Osman said the band had about five songs to choose for the first single, including \"Savoir Faire\" and \"She's in Fashion\". Other contenders were the title track \"Head Music\" and \"Electricity\". According to Suede's biographer David Barnett, \"Head Music\" and \"Electricity\" were played to Sony A&R personnel around the world, who voted in favour of the \"safer\" choice in \"Electricity\" as the first single.
