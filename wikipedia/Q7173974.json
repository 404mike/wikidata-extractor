He was born in Bolsover, Derbyshire, England and died at Fort Dauphin in present-day Manitoba.

The M\u00e9tis have two flags. Both flags use the same design of a central infinity symbol, but are different colours. The red flag was the first flag used. It is currently the oldest flag made in Canada that is still in use. The first red flag was given to Cuthbert Grant in 1815 by the North-West Company as reported by James Sutherland. Days before the Battle of Seven Oaks, \"La Grenouill\u00e8re\" in 1816, Peter Fidler recorded Cuthbert Grant flying the blue flag.

In 1799, Peter Fidler arrived in the area after Thompson's departure, and as the post. This new structure was known as Greenwich House. It was also abandoned by 1801, but Lac La Biche was established as a permanent place of residence for some French-Canadian and M\u00e9tis freetraders and their families. Fur trade activity continued unbroken, due to the importance of the portage, and Lac La Biche was visited by fur traders such as Gabriel Franch\u00e8re and Ross Cox. David Thompson returned in 1812."]}, {"page": "Swan River, Manitoba", "response": ["The town is situated along the Swan River which flows into Swan Lake,  to the north-east. Swan Lake is believed to be named for trumpeter swans that once bred near the lake, but are now locally extirpated. Henry Kelsey became the first European explorer to visit the area in 1690. The name of the lake is first noted on a map created by Peter Fidler in 1795 and again on a French map in 1802 (as L du Cigne). The first permanent European settlement dates back to 1770, when fur traders from both the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company established outposts along the Swan River where they bought and sold goods to local Cree peoples by way of birch bark canoes."]}, {"page": "Anthony Henday", "response": ["Henday may not have been aware that the Blackfoot and the Cree were arch enemies. There is some indication in Henday's journal entries that the Cree were becoming wary of the other tribes Henday and his Cree companions were encountering. While the group was travelling in what Henday refers to the \"Muscuty plains\" they come across a man named \"Attickasish with 2 Archithinue Natives (Blackfeet)\". He says these First Nations Peoples had never been in contact with any Europeans and his Cree travelling companions were afraid of them. Then on Monday, October 14, 1754, Archithinue Natives on horseback approached them and ask them if they were friend or foe. That evening Henday and his guide met and smoked with the Leader of the Archithinue Natives.  Henday offered to have some of the Archithinues go back with them back to York Factory.  The Archithinue Leader did not readily answer Henday and the Leader went on to say that they (Archithinue) could not paddle and that it (York Factory) was too far. The Leader of the Archithinue, probably, knew that his men would be travelling uninvited in Cree territory and would risk being killed off by the Cree and other enemy tribes. After receiving an indefinite answer from the Blackfoot (which Henday took as a \"no\"), Henday returned to York Factory with news he had explored the area and met with the Blackfoot. Since the answer had been unsure, there were no more expeditions to what would eventually be Alberta until Peter Fidler in 1792."]}, {"page": "A-ca-oo-mah-ca-ye", "response": ["Around 1801, the younger Ackomokki drew for Hudson Bay Company surveyor Peter Fidler a detailed map of the lands around the Upper Missouri, including names of rivers, mountains, and peaks and travel time between them and information about 32 tribes populating the region. These drawings were later incorporated into the 1802 edition of Aaron Arrowsmith's map of the Interior Parts of North America.

Fidler reported a rumour that he had heard that the North West Company was trying to direct the M\u00e9tis to action against the Hudson's Bay Company and the newly established Red River Colony (the support was not unanimous among the M\u00e9tis), but he did not attribute the flag to being a gift to the M\u00e9tis.", "On June 1, 1816, Peter Fidler recorded in his Brandon House Journal that the M\u00e9tis, under the leadership of Cuthbert Grant, were flying the blue flag with an infinity symbol when they attacked the Hudson's Bay Company's Brandon House, mere weeks before the Battle of Seven Oaks that happened on June 19, 1816. The reason for the change in the colour of the flag is not known, and Fidler did not provide information about the origin of the flag.

British free trader Thomas Curry, determined to find the extent of the territory explored by the French, ventured from Michilimackinac to Fort Bourbon in 1767 and returned the following spring with four canoes full of the finest pelts.

From 1790 to 1810, intermittent wars were fought between the Confederacy and its former horse suppliers to the south. As the Confederacy reached out to the Arapaho as a potential new source of horses, they were blocked by the Gros Ventres. In 1790, the Gros Ventres joined the Blackfoot Confederacy, making the Iron Confederacy and the Blackfoot enemies for the first time. In response, the Plains Cree allied with the \"Flathead\" (Salish) Indians as a new source of horses. In the 1810s, Peter Fidler described the Cree and Sacree peacefully sharing the Beaver Hills, but he also records that a new geographical place name had been added to the region, the Battle River, which had not been mentioned by this name before, was so-called to commemorate a battle between the Cree and Blackfoot, who would go on to be long-term rivals.The Beaver Hills Country: A History of Land and Life, Graham A.

Early surveyors included Peter Fidler and David Thompson, but exploration began with the Palliser Expedition in 1841, led by James Sinclair. The Hudson's Bay Company, who funded the Palliser Expedition, was interested in more efficient trade routes over the mountains and the British government was interested in growing the Dominion of Canada westward. In 1857, John Palliser entered the area in search of the quickest route over the Continental Divide, crossing over the North Kootenany Pass and into the Flathead Valley in August 1858. Additionally, in 1858 Thomas Blakiston entered the region, who is more commonly known for his explorations in the Waterton Lakes National Park.  Early geological studies were first performed from 1857 to 1859 by Dr. James Hector of the Palliser Expedition of western British North America. By 1861, Dr. Hector named what is now known as Windsor Ridge today as Castle Mountain, renamed in 1979 in conjunction to the renaming of Mount Eisenhower in Banff National Park to Castle Mountain. thumb|Syncline Cross Country Ski Area|alt="]}, {"page": "Peter Fidler (explorer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Fidler"]}, {"page": "Timeline of Alberta history", "response": ["|Peter Fidler reports coal deposits on the banks of Kneehills Creek, near the Red Deer River, north of present-day Drumheller.
