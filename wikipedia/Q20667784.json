From there he signed for Dundee as a part-timer, combining football with acquiring a science degree and then teaching. He made his debut as a 17-year-old, and was able to establish himself as a regular in the team, but by the 1961\u201362 season, when Dundee won the league title for the first time, he had become a fringe member of the squad.In 1963, McGeachie moved to the north-east of England to work for ICI. He also signed for Fourth Division club Darlington. He made his debut on 25 January 1964 in the club's record defeat, 10\u20130 against Doncaster Rovers, and went on to be part of the promotion-winning team of 1965\u201366. He had played regularly \u2013 135 matches in all competitions in less than three years and ever-present in the promotion season \u2013 but suffered cartilage damage in October 1966 that put an end to his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George McGeachie", "response": ["George McGeachie (born 5 February 1959 in Falkirk) is a Scottish former footballer who played as a defender.

He thus became Darlington's first substitute since their use was permitted at the start of the season. He was a member of the Darlington team that beat a Blackpool team containing four England internationals, including full-back Jimmy Armfield, in the third round of the 1965\u201366 League Cup away from home. According to the Journal, he \"had particularly bad luck with two drives, one of which hit the bar from  and the other England international goalkeeper Tony Waiters did well to palm away\". He had better luck with a third: after it \"hammered the crossbar\", Bill Hopper equalised from the rebound, before George McGeachie's goal eliminated the First Division side. The next day's report in the Northern Echo told how Johnstone had \"time and again led Armfield a merry dance\". quoted in  He scored his first goal for Darlington on 25 September, and had seven by the end of October. Although his goalscoring dried up, he finished with nine goals from 25 appearances as Lol Morgan led Darlington to runners-up spot in the 1965\u201366 Fourth Division, which gave them their first promotion since the 1920s. Morgan was replaced over the close season by Jimmy Greenhalgh, and Johnstone played in the first two matches of the following season before himself leaving the club."]}]}}
