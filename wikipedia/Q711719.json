Under its terms, slaves were converted into apprentices and remained bound to their former owners for four years if they had worked in the home and for six years if they had been field labourers. To further delay the change to English in Saint Lucia, the argument was used by jurists that the language shift should not occur until after the apprenticeship period ended to give former slaves adequate time to learn the new official tongue, thus laws continued to be made in both languages for many years. In 1838, the apprenticeship system ended, as British officials felt difficulties would arise from the differing schedules for freedom. Though free, there was never a British plan to give former slaves a voice in Parliament, leaving them as British subjects in a highly stratified system of rights. Denied political and economic rights, former slaves were not entitled to formal recognition as nationals by other nations. In 1838, Saint Lucia was incorporated into the British Windward Islands colony, which was administered by the Governor of Barbados. In 1845, Arthur Wellesley Torrens, Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Lucia proposed that the laws for the territory be compiled. He stressed that English copies of the Coutume de Paris, Code de la Martinique, and British laws should each form part of the compilation. The compilation had not been completed in 1848, when Charles Henry Darling replaced Torrens as Lieutenant-Governor and he personally took on the task of completing it. In 1851, Darling sent his compilation to William Colebrooke, Governor-General of the Windward Colony, which was approved by the Legislative Council, and in 1853 the collected laws of Saint Lucia were first published."]}, {"page": "General Torrens", "response": ["*Arthur Wellesley Torrens (1809\u20131855), British Army major general"]}]}}
