(29 March 1916, London \u2013 1991) was an English cinematographer. His brother Robert Asher was a film and TV director with whom he worked on several occasions.\nHe began his cinematic career as a camera operator, and made his first film as cinematographer or \"lighting cameraman\" on The Magic Bow (1946).\nAsher is best remembered for his work on Hammer films, beginning with The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), the first of Hammer's gothic horrors, and the earliest colour version of the Frankenstein story. He was the director of photography on several of the Hammer horror films including Dracula (1958), The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), The Mummy (1959) and The Brides of Dracula (1960).His style was characterized by a fantastical use of colours, such as non-realistic purples and greens. Director Terence Fisher said of him, \"Jack Asher had a very distinctive style of lighting, which was quite different from Arthur Grant's...(Who) had a more realistic approach to the situation. Jack Asher's was almost theatrical lighting with little tricks, like color slides placed over the lights and so on.\"Asher's non-Hammer films included The Good Die Young (1954) and Reach for the Sky (1956).\nIn 1964, he was nominated for a BAFTA for Best British Cinematography (Colour) for his work on The Scarlet Blade.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hammer Film Productions", "response": ["Production designer Bernard Robinson and cinematographer Jack Asher were instrumental in creating the lavish look of the early Hammer films, usually on a very restricted budget."]}, {"page": "Dracula (1958 film)", "response": ["Dracula was well received by critics and fans of Stoker's works. The trade journal reviews from 1958 were very positive. Film Bulletin noted, \"As produced by Anthony Hinds in somber mid-Victorian backgrounds... and directed by Terence Fisher with an immense flair for the blood-curdling shot, this Technicolor nightmare should prove a real treat. The James Bernard score is monumentally sinister and the Jack Asher photography full of foreboding atmosphere.\" Variety called Peter Cushing's performance impressive and wrote that the \"serious approach to the macabre theme...adds up to lotsa tension and suspense.\""]}, {"page": "The Curse of Frankenstein", "response": ["Torrents of Light: The Art of Jack Asher"]}, {"page": "Jack (given name)", "response": ["*Jack Asher (1916\u20131991), English cinematographer"]}, {"page": "The Abominable Snowman (film)", "response": ["The film was shot in an anamorphic wide screen format called Regalscope, renamed \"Hammerscope\" by the company. Val Guest found it an unsatisfactory format to work in, which made getting in close to the actors difficult and required careful framing of scenes. This was the first film Arthur Grant worked on for Hammer as cinematographer and his reputation for being fast and cheap meant he soon replaced Jack Asher as Hammer's regular cinematographer. Just as he had done with the Quatermass films, Guest tried to give the film \"an almost documentary approach of someone going on an expedition with a camera for Panorama or something\".

The production, which uses up colour film lavishly on such episodes as a cancan sequence, is otherwise hard-up for ideas.\" Variety gave the film a good review, praising Paul Massie for an \"interesting performance\" and Jack Asher for \"colorful and sure\" camerawork. Eugene Archer of The New York Times called the film \"lurid\", and Massie \"frankly ridiculous.\" Harrison's Reports graded the film as \"Fair\", adding, \"Horror fans will hardly be scared by this well-mounted British import...Paul Massie does the best he can in the poorly written twin role.\""]}, {"page": "Arthur Grant (cinematographer)", "response": ["Arthur Grant B.S.C.
