As a member of the British Association of Nature Conservationists he organised the conference 'Wilderness Britain' in 1995 and organised a National Trust seminar on wilderness and wildland values at its Centennial Conference. He was a keynote speaker at the BANC/National Trust 1999 'Nature in Transition' conference in July 1999 and co-authored the National Trust's document 'Call for the Wild'. His articles in BANC's journal ECOS contributed to the new wave of consciousness in conservation known as 'rewilding'  culminating in 2005 with the publication of Beyond Conservation and the founding of the Wildland Network. In this work Taylor argues that conservation is too preservation oriented and needs to be more creative and focussed upon wilder and larger scale land management. Chris Baines, a British conservationist, described Taylor's book as important and brilliantly capturing the changing mood of conservation  and Peter Marren gave it a one page spread in the Independent. Alan Watson Featherstone, of Trees For Life endorsed the cover with 'this book offers a beacon of hope to all those who draw spiritual sustenance from wild Nature' and Bill Adams, at Cambridge University, also endorsing the cover said 'Peter Taylor builds bridges between ecology, countryside policy and spirituality'. In networking ecological practitioners and land managers, Taylor worked to construct a political strategy for rewilding conservation through regional seminars, national conferences and in 2008, his colleague in the network Steve Carver founded the Wildland Research Institute at Leeds University."]}, {"page": "Celtic Music (record label)", "response": ["* CM 042 The Albion Band with Chris Baines: The Wild Side Of Town 1987 also on CD CMCD 042"]}, {"page": "RSPB Medal", "response": ["* Professor Chris Baines (2004)"]}]}}
