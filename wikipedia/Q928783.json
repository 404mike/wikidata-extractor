Its playing standard improved until the early 1930s and although it survived annual difficulties of finding players and pitches it could not survive the outbreak of the Second World War which robbed it of both. When the club was reborn in 1968 it had three main aims - to strive for as high a standard of rugby as possible for the club and its individual members, to create a good physical environment for rugby, and to be part of the sporting and social fabric of Berwick. Pursuit of the first aim has taken the Club to the BT Scottish Premiership (Division 2). In 2004 it won the National Shield and in 2006 reached the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup. To date, the highest individual honours are headed by the 17 full Scottish caps won by Craig Smith and the thirty three by Gavin Kerr. Both were in the 2006 Six Nations Squad. Kerr was a member of the 2003 World Cup Squad and the Six Nations Squads of 2004 and 2005. Mark Lee captained the Scottish VII in 2002 Commonwealth Games and played with the British Army in 2005. Andrew Skeen played for the Scotland VII in the 2006 IRB Tournament. Current Berwick players have won many age-group, School and Student international and regional honours and the Club boasts a full international referee in Iain Ramage. In 2001 the club was invited to join the Border League, becoming only the second English Club in rugby's oldest league. The club has sides in the Border League, the new cross-Border League, the Border Semi-Junior League and age-group competitions from minis to Colts on both sides of the Border. The club has an increasingly skilled Ladies section which won promotion in 1999 and 2000 and was runner-up in the National Bowl in 2004.", "* Gavin Kerr capped for "]}, {"page": "Jed-Forest RFC", "response": ["* Gavin Kerr"]}, {"page": "Allan Jacobsen (rugby union)", "response": ["He was called up to the World Cup squad in Australia in 2003 as a replacement for the injured Gavin Kerr after returning to international duty against Ireland.", "On the 2004 summer tour to Australia, injury curtailed him to only two outings (against Queensland Reds and New South Wales Country), but he regained his starting place for that year's Autumn Tests series.
