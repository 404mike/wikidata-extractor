Two of these groups merged to form the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) and franchise rights were awarded to ten ownership groups. Boston was originally chosen as a team location, but withdrew from the 1967 season as the organization was unable to find a suitable stadium. The NPSL announced that Boston would join the league in 1968 with a team owned by retired Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach and Boston Red Sox executive vice president Dick O'Connell.  In April 1967, General Manager Joe McKenney announced the team name of Beacons was chosen based on fan suggestions and that the team would start play in 1968 playing its home matches at Fenway Park.  In June 1967, the team hired Jack Mansell as head coach, who resigned from Rotherham United to take the position. In preparation for joining the league, the organization hosted an exhibition match between the Baltimore Bays and the Chicago Spurs in July 1967."]}]}}
