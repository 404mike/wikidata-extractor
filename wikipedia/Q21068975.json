In 1877 he was connected with the Coal Company. He was a leader of the dockland strike which lasted fourteen weeks. He was elected to the seat of Port Adelaide in the South Australian House of Assembly and sat from 19 March 1887 to 14 April 1893.\nIn his campaign speech Hopkins showed himself in favor of the Totalizator (and blamed the then depression on its discontinuance; that and granting financial aid to local Councils and Corporations, and the Licensing Bench not allowing licences). The powers of the Licensing Bench should be transferred to Councils. He would lease, not sell, Crown lands; he would have protective duties, as high as 25 per cent. He would reduce Civil Service salaries (except for the Customs), disallow Chinese immigration, abolish the Sunday Closing Act. He was in favor of free, secular, and compulsory education. He wanted a State Bank, and believed in payment of Members. He was against a property tax.He died on 27 January 1897, following a self-inflicted gunshot to the head and surgical attempts to remove the bullet. He had previously shown signs of depression, and his suicide followed a recent history of financial embarrassment in his business as a wine dealer.", "link_mentions": {}}}
