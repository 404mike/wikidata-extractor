Another of Bidgood's sons was the dance band leader Harry Bidgood, also known as Primo Scala. In the 1901 census, Casselden was not living with her husband; she declared herself to be Rosetta Barnard and her 10-year-old son Alan Charles Butler to be \"Allan Barnard\" who was born in New York. Prior to cohabiting with Bidgood, she had three more sons (1893 - Thomas George who died in infancy; 1896 - Thomas Walter; and 1898 - Henry James), all were registered as \"Barnard\" (Harry Bidgood was Henry James Barnard). Thomas Walter was registered with Butler as the mother's name, the other two with Casselden. By the time Thomas Bidgood left his wife and son Albert Thomas, and set up home with Rosetta Casselden/Butler, Alan Charles Butler had moved on, and the remaining three sons adopted the surname Bidgood. A fourth was born in 1914 and named Warwick Bidgood. It is not a requirement of English law to register a change of name, and deed poll is optional."]}, {"page": "Bidgood", "response": ["*Thomas Bidgood (1858\u20131925), English composer and conductor"]}, {"page": "Heritage of the March", "response": ["|10||John C.
