There is currently some dispute over the layout and development of the medieval town and its environs. In 2005, Stuart Wilson bought a field in which, he was convinced, were remains of the lost medieval town. Wilson had previously broken into sites and undermined the work of other archaeologists in the area, claiming \"he once sneaked onto Howell's dig site to prove an ancient wall the professor had uncovered was really a modern field drain\" .This site had first been identified as of potential interest by (the unrelated) Julia Wilson, in 1998.

The programme revealed that Wilson had apparently discovered medieval walls and yard-paving.  In 2008 the Monmouth Archaeological Society said, \"there is now no room for debate\"Stephen Clarke, Down the Dig: Monmouth, an adventure in archaeology, 2008, Monmouth Archaeological Society,  that the excavations by Wilson and others have identified the main part of the medieval town to be around the minor road towards Catbrook, to the south of the current village, on what is now farmland.

One is similar to culture changes observed in Russia, North Africa and parts of the Islamic world, where a politically and socially powerful minority culture becomes, over a rather short period, adopted by a settled majority. This process is usually termed \"elite dominance\".Ward-Perkins, Bryan. \"Why did the Anglo-Saxons not become more British?.\" The English Historical Review 115.462 (2000): 513\u2013533. The second process is explained through incentives, such as the Wergild outlined in the law code of Ine of Wessex which produced an incentive to become Anglo-Saxon or at least English speaking. Historian Malcolm Todd writes, \"It is much more likely that a large proportion of the British population remained in place and was progressively dominated by a Germanic aristocracy, in some cases marrying into it and leaving Celtic names in the, admittedly very dubious, early lists of Anglo-Saxon dynasties. But how we identify the surviving Britons in areas of predominantly Anglo-Saxon settlement, either archaeologically or linguistically, is still one of the deepest problems of early English history.\"Todd, Malcolm. \"Anglo-Saxon Origins: The Reality of the Myth\", in Cameron, Keith. \"The nation: myth or reality?\".
