They lived in the Clifton family seat at Lytham Hall, Lancashire, Kylemore House in Connemara, Ireland, and then at Kildalton Castle on the Scottish island of Islay. After her husband died in 1928 in the Canary Islands on the way home from an abortive expedition to Timbuktu she had his body embalmed and accompanied it back to Scotland for burial,\nHer biography of her colourful husband, published under the title The Book of Talbot, won the 1933 James Tait Black Prize. WH Auden praised the book in a review that appeared in the Criterion. In 1935 Nevill Coghill nominated her for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but the prize was ultimately not awarded that year.\nHer other books include Vision of Peru and Islands of Queen Wilhelmina, later reissued as Islands of Indonesia.\nShe died at Lytham Hall in 1961. John and Violet's son was the dilettante film producer Harry Talbot de Vere Clifton, who squandered much of the family's remaining wealth. Harry Clifton gifted a carved Lapis Lazuli to William Butler Yeats, inspiring the poem Lapis Lazuli.", "link_mentions": {}}}
