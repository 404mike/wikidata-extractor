After graduating from the London School of Medicine for Women in 1890, Gordon worked at the East London Hospital for Children, the Evelina London Children's Hospital, and later had a private practice in Harley Street. While working as a physician, she made a number of public addresses and wrote publications on topics including the effects of prostitution and alcohol dependence on women.\nGordon was appointed as the first British female prison inspector in 1908. During her time as prison inspector, she enacted a number of improvements including on prison work allocation. She also supported the British suffragette movement, and secretly communicated with the Women's Social and Political Union about conditions in prisons. After retirement in 1921, she wrote the book Penal Discipline (1922), which advocated for reforms to the prison system, and the historical novel Chase of the Wild Goose (1936), based on the Ladies of Llangollen.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ladies of Llangollen", "response": ["* The ladies appeared in a \"thinly-veiled biographical novel\", Chase of the Wild Goose by pioneering female physician and author, Mary Gordon, originally published in 1936 by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press.

Gordon claims to have seen the ladies' apparitions at Plas Newydd during a visit in 1934, which inspired her to learn about their lives. As Gordon recounts in the final section of the book, \"The Ladies Meet Me\", she believed herself to be Butler and Ponsonby's \"spiritual descendant\", and hailed them as the feminist progenitors of the modernist female scholars, professionals, and \"friends who prefer to live together.\""]}, {"page": "London School of Medicine for Women", "response": ["* Mary Gordon, first British female prison inspector, graduated 1890"]}, {"page": "Mary Gordon", "response": ["Mary Gordon may refer to:", "*Mary Gordon (prison inspector) (born 1861, British physician and prison inspector)", "*Mary Gordon (writer) (born 1949), American author", "*Mary Gordon (actress) (1882\u20131963), Scottish actress of the 1920s\u201350s who appeared in nearly 300 films", "*Mary Gordon (child advocate) (born 1947), Canadian social entrepreneur, author, and child advocate", "*Mary Gordon Ellis (1889\u20131934), educator and politician from South Carolina", "*Mary Gordon-Watson (born 1948), British equestrian"]}, {"page": "Mary Louisa Gordon", "response": ["#redirectMary Gordon (prison inspector)"]}]}}
