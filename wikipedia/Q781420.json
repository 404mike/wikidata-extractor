He has played for both Celtic and Swindon Town in all positions apart from striker and goalkeeper.\nCaddis started his career with Scottish Premier League club Celtic. He broke into the first team during the 2007\u201308 season, but never managed to hold down a starting place over the next few years. He spent the second half of the 2008\u201309 season on loan to Dundee United. Caddis was sold to English League One club Swindon Town in August 2010. He spent the 2012\u201313 season on loan to Birmingham City, and joined the club on a permanent contract in September 2013. After three-and-a-half seasons in his second spell with Birmingham, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in January 2017. A short spell with Bury of League One preceded a season with Blackburn Rovers and seven months with Bradford City. He rejoined Swindon Town in November 2019.\nCaddis played regularly for the Scotland under-21 team and also captained the side.

His first win came against Peterborough but Birmingham suffered a 5\u20130 home defeat against Barnsley in September. During the January 2013 transfer window, Clark sold Jake Jervis, David Lucas and Jack Butland, who returned on loan for the remainder of the season. Clark struggled to get Birmingham out of the bottom half of the league until back to back wins against Derby County and Middlesbrough took them up to 12th place in March.

Clark continued the start of 2013 with his team producing good form, including a 4\u20130 away win at Crystal Palace and back to back 1\u20130 wins against Bristol City and Leeds.
