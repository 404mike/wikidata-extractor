Saxo based the story on an oral tale of a son taking revenge for his murdered father. Christiern Pedersen, a Canon of Lund, collaborated with Jodocus Badius Ascensius, a fellow enthusiast, to print the work of Saxo Grammaticus early in the sixteenth century. This was the first major step toward securing the historical significance of Gesta Danorum. Starting from that point, the knowledge of it began to spread within the academic community. Oliver Elton, who was the first to translate the first nine books of Gesta Danorum into English, wrote that Saxo was the first writer produced by Denmark."]}, {"page": "Lascelles Abercrombie", "response": ["Abercrombie's poetry consists very largely of long poems in blank verse, mainly in dramatic form. They treat the extremes of imagined rather than actual experience, from ecstasy to anguish and malice, with little in between, in poetry full of sharp, gem-like imagery and generally rugged in sound and meter. Admired for a time by good judges such as Charles Williams, Oliver Elton and Una Ellis-Fermor, and respected by his fellow 'Georgian' poets, it was never popular, and by the late twenties seemed utterly out of date."]}, {"page": "Eugene Onegin", "response": ["The Pushkin Press published a translation in 1937 (reprinted 1943) by the Oxford scholar Oliver Elton, with illustrations by M.

In 1891 Algernon Swinburne wrote that \"The too long delayed publication of his Journal is in every way an almost priceless benefit; but as a final illustration and attestation of a character almost incomparably lovable, admirable, and noble, it is a gift altogether beyond price.\"  The biographer Hesketh Pearson thought it \"Perhaps the most valuable, certainly the most moving, of all his productions; and, since it displays a man whose goodness of heart balanced his greatness of mind, incomparably the most interesting work of its kind ever written.\"Pearson (1987) p. 218  The novelist Hugh Walpole called it \"that masterpiece of human nature\".  For Virginia Woolf, \"Scott's Journals are the best life of Scott in existence...they contain Scott in his glory and Scott in his gloom...in a few passages Scott throws more light upon his genius and its limitations than all his critics in their innumerable volumes\".  The Scott scholar David Hewitt agreed, writing that \"There is no greater or more moving diary in English\"; however he also made the point that its fine artistic shape cannot be credited to Scott, since he quite fortuitously took up the Journal as the tragedy of his last years was about to begin.Hewitt (1981) p. xxiii  The literary historian Oliver Elton believed that the Journal\u2019s high place in English literature was secure: \"Whatever else of Scott's may lose its colour with time, the Journal cannot do so, with its accurate, unexaggerated language of pain.\""]}, {"page": "List of University of the Punjab people", "response": ["* Oliver Elton"]}, {"page": "Elton (name)", "response": ["* Oliver Elton (1861\u20131945), English literary scholar"]}, {"page": "Elton, Oliver", "response": ["#redirectOliver Elton"]}]}}
