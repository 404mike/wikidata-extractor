Much of her life and research was concerned with the study of parapsychology, mainly in order to examine how psychic abilities might demonstrate the abilities, breadth and power of the human mind.  She began to exhibit and develop psychic abilities herself around 1901, and became both a recipient and analyst of many cross-correspondences produced by psychics, most notably the Palm Sunday scripts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jane Ellen Harrison", "response": ["In 1888 Harrison began to publish in the periodical that Oscar Wilde was editing called The Woman's World on \"The Pictures of Sappho.\" Harrison also ended up translating Mythologie figur\u00e9e de la Gr\u00e8ce (1883) by Maxime Collignon as well as providing personal commentary to selections of Pausanias, Mythology & Monuments of Ancient Athens by Margaret Verrall in the same year.
