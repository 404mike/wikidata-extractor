He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, the 1960 Italian Grand Prix, driving a privately entered 2.2-litre Cooper.  He crashed on the first lap of the race at the South Corner, due to brake failure.  He retired with suspension damage and scored no championship points.\nOn 17 October 1955 Arthur Owen, Jim Russell and William Knight drove a 'bobtail' Cooper sports car at the Autodrome de Montlh\u00e9ry to set thirteen international speed and distance records in Class G on this banked track. Owen went on to set further records at Monza in Italy.On 5 September 1959, driving a Cooper-Climax, Owen made fastest time of the day at the Brighton Speed Trials. In 1962, Owen won the British Hill Climb Championship at the wheel of a Cooper-Climax T53, prepared by fellow-competitor Patsy Burt's PMB Garages team. Arthur Owen competed in the 1962 Macau Grand Prix in a Cooper single-seater, qualifying on pole position but crashing early in the race.  He finished third in the first Japanese Grand Prix, held at Suzuka on 3 and 4 May 1963, driving a Lotus 23 sports car.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Hill Climb Championship", "response": ["| 1962 || Arthur Owen"]}, {"page": "1960 Italian Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Arthur Owen", "|  Arthur Owen"]}, {"page": "1960 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Arthur Owen", "|  Arthur Owen", "|align=\"left\"|  Arthur Owen"]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*27 April \u2013 Arthur Owen, racing driver (born 1915)"]}, {"page": "Craigantlet Hillclimb", "response": ["|Arthur Owen"]}, {"page": "1915 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 23 March \u2013 Arthur Owen, racing driver (died 2002)"]}, {"page": "Patsy Burt", "response": ["As well as being a successful racer herself, Patsy Burt and her manager Ron Smith also ran a well-regarded race preparation garage.

PMB were, naturally, also responsible for Patsy Burt's own cars during the rest of her career. The car with which Burt became synonymous, her modified Cooper T59, was built up at PMB Garages in the winter of 1962-63. Chassis number C/PMB/1/63, originally supplied as a 1\u00a0litre Formula Junior car, was adapted to accept a 2\u00a0litre Coventry Climax FPF engine by moving the driving position forward. Burt's short stature allowed the larger engine, with its concomitantly larger fuel and oil tanks, to be mounted in the usual position without having to lengthen the car's wheelbase."]}, {"page": "Brighton Speed Trials", "response": ["|Arthur Owen", "\"During the racing car classes in the afternoon Arthur Owen proved to have the fastest", "\"the best that the four-wheelers could achieve was a brisk 23.50 by Arthur Owen in"]}, {"page": "Bo'ness Hill Climb", "response": ["| The Autocar, June 30, 1961.
