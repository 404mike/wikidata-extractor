Out of that discussion came a Workshop on Standards for Message Passing in a Distributed Memory Environment, held on April 29\u201330, 1992 in Williamsburg, Virginia. Attendees at Williamsburg discussed the basic features essential to a standard message-passing interface and established a working group to continue the standardization process. Jack Dongarra, Tony Hey, and David W. Walker put forward a preliminary draft proposal, \"MPI1\", in November 1992. In November 1992 a meeting of the MPI working group took place in Minneapolis and decided to place the standardization process on a more formal footing.  The MPI working group met every 6 weeks throughout the first 9 months of 1993.  The draft MPI standard was presented at the Supercomputing '93 conference in November 1993. After a period of public comments, which resulted in some changes in MPI, version 1.0 of MPI was released in June 1994. These meetings and the email discussion together constituted the MPI Forum, membership of which has been open to all members of the  high-performance-computing community."]}, {"page": "BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT", "response": ["* Tony Hey, FBCS - ex-VP of Microsoft Research"]}, {"page": "Harkness Fellowship", "response": ["*Tony Hey CBE, academic and corporate vice-president of technical computing at Microsoft"]}, {"page": "E-Science", "response": ["Tony Hey led the core programme from 2001 to 2005.
