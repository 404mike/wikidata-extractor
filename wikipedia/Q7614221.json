Despite this, Walsh claimed that Peltier would be a \"good signing for any club in this league.\" Having been made available, Peltier chose to return home from a pre-season training camp in Austria, and this triggered transfer interest from his former club Huddersfield Town and Leeds United. Both clubs were reported to have bid around \u00a3600,000 but both were rejected by Leicester City who had set an asking price of \u00a3850,000.
