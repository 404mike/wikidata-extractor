He played as a goalkeeper.\nMeates was born in Bournemouth, which was then in Hampshire. He began his football career with Eastbourne before joining Small Heath in 1895. He took over from Jim Roach as first-team goalkeeper in the middle of the 1895\u201396 season after the club had suffered some heavy defeats. Meates made his debut on 3 February 1896 in a 3\u20130 defeat at Everton, and retained the starting place for the remainder of the season, but failed to stop the rot sufficiently for Small Heath to avoid relegation via the test match system. He played only twice the next season, having surrendered the goalkeeper's jersey to Ernest Pointer, and left for Warmley of the Southern League in 1897. The following year he had an unsuccessful trial with Nottingham Forest.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eastbourne Town F.C.", "response": ["*  William Meates (1897)"]}, {"page": "Jim Roach (footballer)", "response": ["Roach was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire.
