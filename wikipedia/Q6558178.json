This was followed by a further collaboration with BK \"Hoovers And Horns\" re-entering the chart and peaking at number 57. 7 Magazine, the weekly dance music publication, featured Fergie on the front cover of their 13 September issue with the headline \"I've been stereotyped as a hard house DJ\". The feature was to promote his first commercially available solo DJ mix 7 Live #3: Fergie which was released on CD in the week after. On the inside cover of the CD, the editor of 7 Magazine Damien Morris described Fergie as \"The best young DJ in the UK today\". In the same month, Godskitchen opened their new nightclub CODE in Digbeth, Birmingham. As well as continuing to DJ regularly at the Godskitchen events held there on Fridays, he simultaneously began a new residency at the club; Polysexual was launched as a weekly 12-hour Sunday party beginning at noon which Fergie hosted with Lisa Lashes. The pair appeared together on the front cover of dance music magazine iDJ to promote the club opening. In the October issue of Muzik, he was placed 29th in the magazine contributors' Top 50 DJs of the World list. November saw him accompany Godskitchen to The Venetian in Las Vegas for their first ever US show. His first entry in the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs poll came in late 2000, at number 8. As of 2018, this is the highest new entry there has been in the history of the poll. He finished the year with a first time appearance on the December cover of Mixmag with the headline \"Superstar 2000!\".", "From 1995 through to 2000, Fergie's DJ sets were composed mainly of hard house music and he became closely associated with it. Sundissential promoter, Madders, attributed the popularity of the sound in 2001 to \"Tony (De Vit)'s work in the mid 90s, and people like Andy Farley, Lisa Lashes, and Fergie in the late 90s.\" However. Fergie had grown uncomfortable with the direction hard house had taken. From 2000, for a period of around two years, he regularly changed his music style and played a wider variety of dance music. In an interview in 2009, Fergie explained, \"As I had been pigeonholed as a hard house DJ, I didn't want to (...) jump into another sound. So over the next few years, I dipped my finger in a few different styles from trance to house to a bit of tech house and some techno.\" In the booklet notes of his 2001 Hard Energy CD, he thought the music he played was better described as hard music rather than hard house. The change in musical direction, away from hard house, initially had a negative impact on the number of DJ bookings he received and the DJ fees he could command."]}, {"page": "Hoover sound", "response": ["|Lisa Lashes"]}, {"page": "DJ Lisa Lashes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lisa Lashes"]}, {"page": "List of club DJs", "response": ["*Lisa Lashes, British DJ born in Leicester, England."]}, {"page": "List of people from Leicester and Leicestershire", "response": ["*Lisa Lashes (DJ)"]}, {"page": "Lashes (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Lisa Lashes (born 1971), British DJ"]}, {"page": "Kutski", "response": ["His tune \"Closer To God\", released on X-Cite, was reviewed positively and supported by Anne Savage, Lisa Lashes and The Tidy Boys.

The series was based entirely on trance music to begin with, but as it progressed, installments based on other electronic music genres were released, such as the Lisa Lashes-mixed hard house compilation Euphoria Hard House (2000). The installment which departed most from a trance sound was Chilled Euphoria, digitally mixed by Red Jerry and released in May 2000. Digitally mixed instead of mixed with analogue equipment, the album focused on chill-out music for relaxation, featuring music from genres such as ambient music and trip hop, and was a commercial and critical success. In 2001, Flaton Izbac, one of the producers of the Euphoria albums, commented that \"Chilled Euphoria turned out to be one of those albums that people kept talking about, emeails, letters, etc., thanks to Sarah HB from Radio 1 for the exposure on the Post Clubbing Favourite Breakfast Show and those of you who now own a copy\".Liner notes. Its success secured a follow-up album. However, it would have a slightly different theme.", "For the sequel album to Chilled Euphoria, the creators of the Euphoria series decided to make an album \"specifically intended\" to enhance the experiences in such meditative states. Again approaching Red Jerry to digitally mix the album, the album was named Deep & Chilled Euphoria and was conceived in late 2000 for release in early 2001 after the release of Dave Pearce's first installment in the series, Transcendental Euphoria, in November 2000, and Lisa Lashes' first installment to the series, Hard House Euphoria, in December 2000. Although Hard House Euphoria was a commercial success, it was not as much a critical success. The new Deep & Chilled Euphoria album would allow the series to recoup its critical standing. It was Jerry's third mix album for the series, following 'Deeper' Euphoria (1999)http://www.allmusic.com/album/euphoria-deeper-mw00001090858 and the aforementioned predecessor to the new album, Chilled Euphoria (2000)."]}]}}
