They played their first competitive game on April 28, 2007, beating fellow expansion franchise Lancaster Rattlers 2\u20131, and setting the wheels in motion for what turned out to be a promising first season. Four wins in their next five games \u2013 including impressive victories over traditional regional powerhouses Fresno Fuego and Orange County Blue Star \u2013 propelled the Fusion to the top of the table by mid-season. However, a spate of injuries began to take its toll on their roster, and by the middle of July the Fusion were stuttering towards the finish line, still in with a shout of making the playoffs, but being hampered by damaging defeats to Fresno and the Southern California Seahorses. By the time the final set of games came round, Fusion needed three points from their final two games to leapfrog the San Fernando Valley Quakes into the playoffs, but two consecutive ties \u2013 3\u20133 with Southern California Seahorses and a hugely disappointing 0\u20130 with Los Angeles Storm \u2013 meant that they finished their debut season fourth in the table. English striker Mark Draycott was the team's leading marksman, notching an impressive ten goals, while Eric Avila and Chance Myers led the assist stats.", "Ventura started their second competitive season without the services of Chance Myers and Eric Avila, both of whom had been taken in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft, and Mark Draycott, who had returned to England to play for Swindon Supermarine. Despite this, anticipation was high that success would be swift, but they actually started the season sluggishly, losing two of their first four games, and not picking up a victory until their 3\u20130 triumph over Fresno Fuego in late May. This signalled an about-turn in form; Fusion enjoyed four wins in June, including an impressive 4\u20131 thrashing of Fresno Fuego away from home. Two more impressive victories \u2013 2\u20130 over Southern California Seahorses and 4\u20130 over Lancaster Rattlers \u2013 kept Fusion's playoff run on course, but a shock 1\u20130 defeat to struggling Orange County Blue Star at home meant that they had to beat eventual divisional champions San Fernando Valley Quakes in their next game, or their season would be over. The Quakes won 3\u20132 in a bad-tempered game at Pierce College, and Ventura were left rueing another year of missed opportunities. They eventually finished the season in 3rd, just two points out of the playoffs; Hagop Chirishian was the team's top scorer, with 4 goals, while former Chivas USA midfielder Rodrigo L\u00f3pez led with 3 assists.", "*  Mark Draycott"]}, {"page": "Draycott (surname)", "response": ["*Mark Draycott (born 1985), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Draycott, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Draycott"]}]}}
