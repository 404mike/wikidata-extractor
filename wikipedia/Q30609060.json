Belgium's Robin Vanderbemden also looked to be having a strong leg all alone in lane 9.  Coming down the homestretch, London sped up to have the USA the handoff first to Gil Roberts.  Roberts came around the turn to take a 3-metre lead at the break, followed by GBR's Rabah Yousif and Spain's Lucas B\u00faa, TTO's Jereem Richards was on the outside passing people.  Into the far turn, he had beaten Yousif and kept going making up the gap on Roberts getting to within a metre.  Down the homestretch, Roberts again opened up the gap, handing off to Michael Cherry three metres ahead of Trinidad and Tobago's handoff to Machel Cedenio.  Great Britain's handoff to Dwayne Cowan was just a metre back as the top three teams had separated from the rest of the contenders.  Through most of the lap, Cherry held a five-metre lead while Cowan was challenging Cedenio.  Cedenio held off Cowan then on the homestretch he separated, making a run at Cherry.  USA passed to Fred Kerley barely a metre ahead of TTO's pass to Lalonde Gordon.  Kerley was the anchor runner of the fastest 4x400 relay of the year prior to the championships, running for Texas A&M at the end of the college season more than two months earlier.  Kerley held that one-metre lead down the backstretch, then widened it slightly through the final turn.  Behind Gordon, GBR's Martyn Rooney was closing down the gap to bring his team to within a metre coming off the turn.  Kerley straightened up and ran tight for the finish while Gordon went to the outside for running room and ran past him, pulling away to a decisive 3-metre victory.  Kerley maintained his distance from Rooney to get silver for USA.  GBR's Rooney finished 8 metres ahead of the Belgian team, which included three Borl\u00e9e brothers.", "| 4 || 2 || 6 ||align=left|  ||align=left|Rabah Yousif, Dwayne Cowan, Jack Green, Martyn Rooney || 3:00.10 || , ", "|  || 3 ||align=left|  ||align=left|Matthew Hudson-Smith, Rabah Yousif, Dwayne Cowan,  Martyn Rooney  || 2:59.00 ||"]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the World Athletics Championships", "response": ["|  || Matthew Hudson-SmithRabah YousifDwayne CowanMartyn RooneyJack Green* || 2017 London || Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay"]}, {"page": "England at the 2018 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|align=left|Dwayne Cowan", "|align=left|Matthew Hudson-SmithDwayne CowanRabah YousifJack Green"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2018 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["|  ||align=\"left\"|   || Matthew Hudson-SmithDwayne CowanRabah YousifJack Green ||  ||  ||"]}, {"page": "2018 Athletics World Cup", "response": ["|  || 2 || align=left|Cameron ChalmersDwayne CowanMartyn RooneyOwen Smith || align=left| ||  || The lead-off runner got injured during the warm up || 0"]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2018 Athletics World Cup", "response": ["|align=left|Cameron ChalmersDwayne CowanMartyn RooneyOwen Smith"]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2018 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|  || Rabah YousifDwayne CowanMatthew Hudson-SmithMartyn Rooney|| Men's 4 x 400 metres relay || ", "|align=left|Dwayne Cowan", "|align=left|Dwayne CowanMatthew Hudson-SmithMartyn RooneyRabah YousifCameron Chalmers (heat only)"]}, {"page": "2018 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 400 metres", "response": ["| 7 || 4 || 6 || align=left|Dwayne Cowan || align=left| || 45.75 || ", "| 12 || 1 || 2 || align=left|Dwayne Cowan || align=left| || 45.45 || "]}, {"page": "2018 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["| Cameron Chalmers, Dwayne Cowan  Rabah Yousif, Martyn Rooney ", "| 1 || 1 ||align=left|  ||align=left| Cameron Chalmers, Dwayne Cowan, Rabah Yousif, Martyn Rooney || 3:01.62 || , ", "|  || 5 ||align=left|  ||align=left| Rabah Yousif, Dwayne Cowan, Matthew Hudson-Smith, Martyn Rooney || 3:00.36 || "]}, {"page": "2019 IAAF World Relays \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["| 6 || 1 || align=left| || align=left|Rabah Yousif, Dwayne Cowan, Cameron Chalmers, Martyn Rooney || 3:02.67 || q, SB", "| 5 || align=left| || align=left|Rabah Yousif, Dwayne Cowan, Martyn Rooney, Cameron Chalmers || 3:04.96 || *WC || 4"]}, {"page": "2019 European Athletics Team Championships", "response": ["| Dwayne Cowan || 46.18"]}, {"page": "2019 European Athletics Team Championships Super League", "response": ["| 5 || 2 || align=left|Dwayne Cowan || align=left| || 46.82 || Q ||", "| 2 || 5 || align=left|Dwayne Cowan || align=left| || 46.18 || || 11"]}, {"page": "Joe Brier", "response": ["|Team of Brier, James William, Kevin Metzger, Dwayne Cowan"]}, {"page": "2021 World Athletics Relays \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |Joseph Brier, James Williams, Kevin Metzger, Dwayne Cowan"]}]}}
