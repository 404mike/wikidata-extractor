Members of the House of Commons are forbidden from resigning. To circumvent this prohibition a legal fiction is used. An appointment to an \"office of profit under The Crown\" disqualifies an individual from sitting as a Member of Parliament (MP). As such, several such positions are maintained to allow MPs to resign. Currently, the positions of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds are used, and are specifically designated as qualifying for this purpose under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975; historically several other offices have also been used. The appointment is traditionally made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The position was reworked in 1861 by William Ewart Gladstone, who was worried about the honour conferred by appointment to people such as Edwin James, who had fled to the United States over \u00a310,000 in debt. As such, the letter by the Chancellor was rewritten to omit any references to honour."]}, {"page": "Marylebone (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Edwin James "]}, {"page": "Edwin John James", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edwin James (barrister)"]}, {"page": "Edwin James", "response": ["Edwin James may refer to:", "* Edwin James (barrister) (c. 1812\u20131882), English lawyer, Member of Parliament and would-be actor", "* Edwin James (scientist) (1797\u20131861), American botanist, geographer, geologist and explorer", "* Edwin James (footballer) (1869\u2013?), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Stryver", "response": ["Real life inspiration for the character was likely the 19th century British barrister, Edwin James."]}, {"page": "Shadwell forgeries", "response": ["The trial was held at Guildford Assizes on 4 August 1858.
