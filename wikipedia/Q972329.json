He was a composer at Rare from 1985 to 2009, and was the company's sole musician up until 1994. He has gained a following for his work on various games, particularly Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country series. Wise is known for his atmospheric style of music, mixing natural environmental sounds with prominent melodic and percussive accompaniment.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Donkey Kong Country", "response": ["David Wise composed most of the soundtrack. Wise started composing as a freelance musician; he originally assumed his music would be replaced with compositions by Koji Kondo, the Super Mario composer, because he understood the importance of the Donkey Kong licence to Nintendo. Rare asked Wise to record three jungle demo tunes that were merged to become the \"DK Island Swing\", the first level's track. Wise said, \"I guess someone thought the music was suitable, as they offered me a full time position at Rare\". Rare allocated 32 kilobits to Wise. Prior to composing, Wise was shown the graphics and given an opportunity to play the level they would appear in, which gave him a sense of the music he would compose. Wise then chose samples and optimised the music to work on the SNES.", "Category:Video games scored by David Wise"]}, {"page": "Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest", "response": ["The soundtrack of Diddy's Kong Quest was composed by David Wise and was released in the United States as The Original Donkey Kong Country 2 Soundtrack. The soundtrack maintains similarity to its predecessor with its prominent percussion and eclectic genres ranging between big band, disco and hip hop. The melodies and rhythms are largely comical in tone, but occasionally melancholic. Certain themes are reminiscent of compositions by Vangelis and Phil Collins. Wise cited Koji Kondo's music for the Mario and Zelda games, Geoff and Tim Follin's music for Plok, and synthesizer-based film soundtracks released in the 1980s as influences in creating the music for the Donkey Kong Country series. As with its predecessor, the music was produced for the SNES's SPC700 chip for the game to sound similar to the Korg Wavestation synthesizer.", "The game's soundtrack was the focus of an OverClocked ReMix collaboration, Serious Monkey Business.

However, Kirkhope has commented he tried to retain the darker, atmospheric tone that Wise brought to Donkey Kong Country, and included a remix of Wise's \"Jungle Japes\". Donkey Kong Country 3 composer Eveline Fischer was originally assigned to Donkey Kong 64; Kirkhope became involved after he was asked for assistance, and he provided Donkey Kong's voice. The \"DK Rap\", which introduces the Kong character abilities, was conceived and written by George Andreas, scored and recorded by Kirkhope, and performed by Andreas and Chris Sutherland. It was intended to be a lighthearted joke despite being interpreted as a \"serious\" songwriting attempt at the game's launch. Nintendo of America ran a \"DK Rap\" contest in which fans record their own version of the rap to win prizes including a trip to its headquarters."]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* David Wise"]}, {"page": "Video game music", "response": ["The mid-to-late 1980s software releases for these platforms had music developed by more people with greater musical experience than before.

By the late 1980s, video game music was being sold as cassette tape soundtracks in Japan, inspiring American companies such as Sierra, Cinemaware and Interplay to give more serious attention to video game music by 1988.
