She believes that for most artists, there is no divide between their \u2018private\u2019 life and their \u2018professional\u2019 output. All realisations and insights gleaned from inter-personal relationships, travels, media etc can be transmuted into a heightened awareness / expression of where human society is at today, and possibly where it may be heading towards.\nIntrigued with stories of ordinary people, Ketna's studio in Singapore became an experiment in communal living and an 'organic' artist collective.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Index of Singapore-related articles", "response": ["* Ketna Patel"]}, {"page": "List of Indians in Singapore", "response": ["* Ketna Patel \u2013 visual artist (formerly an architect).
