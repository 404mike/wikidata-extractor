This was a route followed by many tourists and Wyndham's book was the first published guidebook with illustrations of the scenery. Surviving oil-paintings by Barret suggest that he must have made a similar tour, starting in the south and many of his oil paintings are taken from similar viewpoints to those used by Grimm.For the work of Grimm and the Welsh tour see: Hauptmann W.

There are a number of paintings which may portray scenery in Merionethshire and in Snowdonia Barret produced a number of paintings of Snowdon from Llyn Nantle and Llyn Padarn.
