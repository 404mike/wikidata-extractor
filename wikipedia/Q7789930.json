One of his immediate predecessors at \"Scott's\" was George Frederick Bodley, who was already beginning to establish his own reputation.  A warm friendship developed between two. When he returned to Warwickshire, Garner undertook various small works as a representative of Scott, including the repair of the old chapel of the Lord Leycester Hospital at Warwick, which he buttressed into security.
