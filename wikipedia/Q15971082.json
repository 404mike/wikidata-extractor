While the journey was his idea, Clan na Gael financed the expedition. During their stop in Christiania, his companion Adler Christensen was taken to the British legation, where a reward was allegedly offered if Casement were \"knocked on the head\".Mitchell, Angus, Casement, p. 99. British diplomat Mansfeldt Findlay, in contrast, advised London that Christensen had \"implied that their relations were of an unnatural nature and that consequently he had great power over this man\".National Archives, Kew, PRO FO 95/776 Findlay provided no evidence to support this insinuation.", "This argument reflects the question raised in 1955 by Lord Russell of Liverpool concerning the existence of the diaries at the time of Casement's trial. Anatomy of a Lie, by Paul R. Hyde  proposes a paradigm shift \u2013 the diaries were fabricated after Casement's execution as forged versions of the original typescripts. It is also demonstrated that the homosexual dimension was originally the invention of British Envoy Mansfeldt Findlay in Christiania (present-day Oslo in Norway) in a false memorandum on 29 October 1914. The rarely-seen documentFO 337/107 containing the first innuendo has never been analysed before and is unmentioned by all Casement authors save one. Hyde also demonstrates that in the following months Findlay amplified his allegations because he feared exposure of his written bribe through a threatened lawsuit against him by Casement; a subsequent diplomatic scandal might have destroyed his career."]}, {"page": "Mansfeld (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Mansfeldt Findlay (1861\u20131932), British diplomat"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Mansfeldt Findlay (1861\u20131932), UK Ambassador to Saxony (1907\u20131909), to Bulgaria (1909\u20131911), and to Norway (1911\u20131923)Harrow, 1800\u20131911, p. 510"]}, {"page": "List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Norway", "response": ["*1911\u20131923: Sir Mansfeldt Findlay, G.B.E., K.C.M.G."]}, {"page": "Findlay (surname)", "response": ["*Sir Mansfeldt Findlay (1861\u20131932), British diplomat"]}, {"page": "List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Saxony", "response": ["*1907\u20131909: Mansfeldt Findlay"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["** Sir Mansfeldt Findlay (3 June)"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Bulgaria", "response": ["*1909\u20131911: Mansfeldt Findlay"]}, {"page": "Francis Oswald Lindley", "response": ["Beginning in 1923, he succeeded Sir Mansfeldt Findlay as the Minister to Norway in Oslo.
