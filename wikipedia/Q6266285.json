In 1924, after signing a new one-season contract with Thistle including a signing bonus, he moved to the United States where he signed with the Boston Soccer Club of the American Soccer League. This nearly led to the suspension of the United States Football Association, an action prevented by stronger agreements between FIFA member associations on player transfer rules. Ballantyne spent four seasons with Boston before returning to Thistle in 1929. Ballantyne played there until 1935 when he was briefly loaned to Falkirk F.C. before moving to Queens Park Rangers. He finished his career with them in 1937.", "link_mentions": {}}}
