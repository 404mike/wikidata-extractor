In 1924, after signing a new one-season contract with Thistle including a signing bonus, he moved to the United States where he signed with the Boston Soccer Club of the American Soccer League. This nearly led to the suspension of the United States Football Association, an action prevented by stronger agreements between FIFA member associations on player transfer rules. Ballantyne spent four seasons with Boston before returning to Thistle in 1929. Ballantyne played there until 1935 when he was briefly loaned to Falkirk F.C. before moving to Queens Park Rangers. He finished his career with them in 1937.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Ballantyne", "response": ["*Johnny Ballantyne (1899 \u2013 after 1936), Scottish footballer "]}, {"page": "Ballantyne", "response": ["* Johnny Ballantyne (1899-?), an early twentieth-century Scottish football player"]}, {"page": "Barney Battles Jr.", "response": ["On his arrival in the U.S., Battles began playing for the Boston Celtics, a Sullivan Square team.  While playing for the Celtics, he caught the attention of a scout from the Boston Soccer Club. Although not enjoying the popular status of baseball, soccer (as the sport was known) was buoyant in 1920s America, boosted by a ready supply of talent from the country's numerous immigrant communities and significant corporate investment from industrial giants such as the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. Aged 19, Battles was offered a contract with the newly founded Boston Soccer Club, playing in the American Soccer League (ASL). The club recruited extensively from British football and among his teammates were fellow Scots Johnny Ballantyne and Alex McNab, while former Rangers player Tommy Muirhead was appointed player-manager."]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|IL ||||Johnny Ballantyne"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Johnny Ballantyne"]}, {"page": "1925\u201326 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Johnny Ballantyne"]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Johnny Ballantyne"]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Johnny Ballantyne"]}]}}
