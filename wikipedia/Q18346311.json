He was born in Norwich, Norfolk and died at Dresden in Germany.\nMorse was educated at Dedham, Essex and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played cricket as a lower-order right-handed batsman for the Cambridge University side from 1842 to 1844 and appeared in the University Match against Oxford University in all three seasons. But his only innings of note in this period was a score of 82 made for the MCC against Cambridge University in 1844; this proved to be his highest first-class score and his only score over 50 in a 20-year cricket career spanning 40 first-class games. A contemporary report described his innings: \"Mr. Morse played with caution, and now and then indulged in a severity of hitting which was really cricket.\"Morse graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1844 and then was admitted to the Inner Temple; he was called to the bar in 1848 but never practised as a barrister. Instead he settled at Aylsham and became a Justice of the Peace and deputy lieutenant of Norfolk. This career enabled him to continue to play cricket fairly frequently through to his 40s, though rarely did he make much impact as a batsman, and he did not bowl in major matches. In 1849, for example, he was a member of a very strong \"England\" side (the All-England Eleven) in a game against Surrey, playing alongside John Wisden, Alfred Mynn, Fuller Pilch and Jemmy Dean.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Morse", "response": ["* Charles Morse (cricketer) (1820\u20131883), English cricketer", "* Charles Morse Stotz (1899\u20131985), American architect and historical preservationist"]}, {"page": "Charles Carpenter (cricketer)", "response": ["Carpenter made his first-class debut for the Gentlemen of Kent and Sussex against the Gentlemen of England at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury, in 1857.  He scored 15 runs in the Gentlemen of Kent and Sussex's first-innings of 143, before being dismissed by Harvey Fellows.  In the Gentlemen of England's first-innings, he took the wickets of Spencer Ponsonby, William Nicholson and Charles Morse, finishing with figures of 3/32 to help bowl them out for just 67.  The Gentlemen of Kent and Sussex made 85 in their second-innings, with Carpenter scoring 5 runs before he was dismissed by John Parker.  He went wicketless in the Gentlemen of England's second-innings, with Gentlemen of Kent and Sussex winning by 42 runs.  Over ten years later he made two first-class appearances in 1868 Sussex against Surrey and Middlesex.  He struggled in these two matches, scoring 27 runs at an average of 6.75, with a high score of 11."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Charles Morse"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1827\u20131863)", "response": ["* Charles Morse (1844\u20131851) : C.
