In 1804 he published anonymously Familiar Epistles to J. F. Jones, Esquire, on the State of the Irish Stage, a series of caustic criticisms in verse on the management of the Dublin theatres. The book ran through five editions in one year. Equally successful was the Intercepted Letter from Canton (1805), also anonymous, a satire on Dublin society in the guise of a report on the manners of the Chinese at Quang-tchen on the \"Li-fee\". During this period a rather scathing poem attributed to Croker led to the suicide of actor John Edwin, husband of Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin. In 1807 he published a pamphlet on The State of Ireland, Past and Present, in which he advocated Catholic emancipation."]}, {"page": "List of people from Dublin", "response": ["*Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin \u2013 stage actress"]}, {"page": "1771 in Ireland", "response": ["**Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin n\u00e9e Richards, actress (died 1854)."]}, {"page": "John Edwin (1768\u20131805)", "response": ["A tombstone, erected by Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin in St. Werburgh's churchyard, Dublin, attributes her husband's death to the acuteness of his sensibility."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Rebecca", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Edwin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Rebecca Richards", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Richards", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin"]}, {"page": "List of Irish child actors", "response": ["*Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin (c. 1771-1854), made her stage debut at age 8 in Dublin."]}, {"page": "William Oxberry", "response": ["He also edited The New English Drama, consisting of 113 plays, with prefatory remarks, in 22 vols. 1818\u201324; and wrote The Actress of All Work, played in Bath on 8 May 1819, in which Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin assumed half a dozen different characters.
