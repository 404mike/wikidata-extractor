In a 20-year career he released 10 studio albums, two live collections and a number of collaborations. He is also a speaker, piano accompanist, activist and radio presenter, and he has written for a range of publications.  For several years he contributed a weekly column on the arts to the left-wing newspaper The Morning Star. T-T's most recent album is Best Of Chris T-T, a career retrospective double-CD released on 19 May 2017 by London-based independent label Xtra Mile Recordings.While T-T did not achieve mainstream success, his influence as an underground artist is widely felt and his music was consistently praised by critics over two decades.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fox hunting", "response": ["* Frank Turner Covered Chris T-T's Song \"when the huntsman comes a marching\" which criticises foxhunters due to social class and the cruelty of foxhunting"]}, {"page": "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", "response": ["Never released as a single in U.S. and generally unknown upon its initial album release, \"Rosalita\" began to get FM radio airplay when an advance version of \"Born to Run\" was given out to rock radio stations. As Springsteen gained commercial success, \"Rosalita\" became one of his most popular airplay tracks, and is still heard on classic rock radio. The song, despite never receiving an official US single release, has been lauded hugely by music critics in the years since its release in 1973. On its release Ken Emerson of Rolling Stone dubbed it \"a raucous celebration of desire.\" In Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau described it as \"more lyrical and ironic than you could have dreamed\". George P Pelecanos of Uncut magazine has called it \"One of the great rock'n roll performances, and as close to a perfect song as anyone's ever recorded,\" while Chris T-T in the same publication declared \"Never mind The Beatles or The Rolling Stones, this is the best rock'n roll track of all time.\" The song is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.
