He was educated at Eton and Exeter College, Oxford, being called to the bar in 1847. On leaving Oxford he took part in the business management of The Times, and on his father's death became sole manager, delegating some of his work to Mowbray Morris. He was a man of scholarly tastes and serious religious views, and his conscientious character had a marked influence on the tone of the paper. It was under him that the successive improvements in the printing machinery, begun by his father in 1814, at last reached the stage of the \"Walter Press\" in 1869, the pioneer of modern newspaper printing-presses.\nIn 1847 Walter was elected to Parliament for Nottingham as a moderate Liberal, and was re-elected in 1852 and in 1857. In 1859 he was returned for Berkshire, where he lived at Bearwood House in Sindlesham.  John Walter built a model village arranged around a green at Sindlesham, whose buildings included a \"typically solid Victorian building\" which housed a pub and still bears the family name today, as the Walter Arms.Though defeated in 1865, John Walter III was again elected to Parliament for Berkshire in 1868, and held the seat until he retired in 1885.Walter was twice married, first in 1842 to Emily Frances Court (d. 1858), and then in 1861 to Flora Macnabb. His eldest son by his first marriage, John, was accidentally drowned at Bearwood on Christmas Eve in 1870, while trying to rescue his brother and cousin.Walter was succeeded by Arthur Fraser Walter (1846\u20131910), his second son by his first marriage. A.F. Walter remained chief proprietor of The Times until 1908, when it was converted into a company. He then became chairman of the board of directors, and on his death was succeeded in this position by his son John.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Walter (publisher)", "response": ["John Walter (1 January 1738 \u2013 17 November 1812) was an English newspaper publisher and founder of The Times newspaper, which he launched on 1 January 1785 as The Daily Universal Register.

In 1843, an organisation founded by animal-rights and pro-temperance activists was established to help this social cause. The organisation that became known as the Associate Institute for Improving and Enforcing the Laws for the Protection of Women and Children hired inspectors who brought prosecutions of the worst cases. It focused its efforts on work-class women, since Victorian practise was to deny that middle-class or aristocratic families were in need of such intervention. There were sometimes cracks in the facade of propriety. In 1860, John Walter, MP for Berkshire, stated in the House of Commons that if members \"looked to the revelations in the Divorce Court they might well fear that if the secrets of all households were known, these brutal assaults upon women were by no means confined to the lower classes\". A strong deterrent to middle-class or aristocratic wives seeking legal recourse, or divorce, was the social stigma and shunning that would follow such revelations in a public trial."]}, {"page": "John Walter, III", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Walter (editor, born 1818)"]}, {"page": "Finchampstead", "response": ["The absence of public houses in the California area is due to a restrictive covenant imposed by John Walter when he sold the land in this area."]}, {"page": "Arthur Fraser Walter", "response": ["Born on 12 September 1846, Walter was the second son of John Walter, the third of the name to edit The Times since it was established in 1785.

The architect was Robert Kerr and the house was constructed between 1865 and 1874. The family fortune had been made by Walter's grandfather, John Walter I. Originally a coal merchant and underwriter, in 1785 John Walter had established The Daily Universal Register, renamed as The Times in 1788. In 1816, Walter's father, John Walter II purchased the Bear Wood estate in Berkshire from the Crown Estate and in 1822 built a small villa on the site of the present house. Nothing remains of this first building, which was swept away in the gargantuan rebuilding undertaken by Kerr for John Walter III. The cost, \u00a3129,000, , was double the original estimate.", "John Walter I was born in London in 1738. Making, and subsequently losing, a fortune as a coal merchant and underwriter, in 1785, Walter established The Daily Universal Register, \"to record the principal occurrences of the times\".  Renamed The Times in 1788, within twenty years The Thunderer had become the newspaper of record for the British Empire. By a combination of exceptionally fast reporting; The Times' report of Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar was published several days before the British government received the official communique from the Admiralty; and technological innovation, The Times had the first steam-powered printing press; Walter's son, John Walter II, made the newspaper profitable. Some of the revenues were deployed to buy the estate of Bear Wood from the Crown, and in 1822 Walter II built a small villa, in a neoclassical style, on the site. In 1864 his son, John Walter III, employed Robert Kerr to replace his father's villa with an enormous mansion in the Jacobethan style.", "The planning of Bearwood followed very closely the details of Kerr's book. Mark Girouard, in his pioneering study, The Victorian Country House, calls it a \"synopsis [with] interminable offices, corridors, stairs and entrances\". Everything for the house's construction and operation was undertaken on site; the 4,477,000 red bricks used were fired in the Bearwood brick kilns, the gas came from the estate's gasworks,  the \"elaborate and massive joinery\" was carved in the estate's workshops. Michael Hall, the architectural writer, records that 380 workmen were on the Bearwood site in 1868. The final cost of the house came to \u00a3129,000, double Kerr's estimate. His attempts to negotiate an increase on his commission were unsuccessful. By the time of the house's completion, Walter's stupendous income from The Times, \u00a350,000 a year in 1865, was beginning to falter. The Times' circulation, already declining, came under more sustained assault in the decades ahead, with the rise of the middle-market newspapers, in particular the Daily Mail. In 1908, John Walter's grandson, John Walter V, saw control of the paper pass to the Mail's founder, Lord Northcliffe.", "In 1911 John Walter V put the Bearwood estate up for sale. It failed to secure a buyer, and during the First World War, the house was used as a billet for Canadian soldiers. In 1919, the house with some of the grounds was purchased by Sir Thomas Lane Devitt, chairman of the shipping company Devitt and Moore and founder of the Naval College at Pangbourne. The purchase enabled Devitt to relocate the Royal Merchant Navy School from its original site in central London."]}, {"page": "Barkham Brook", "response": ["The tributary begins at Longmoor Lake, which covers  and is situated in California Country Park. It was created by John Walter III, who extended an original pond after he bought the land to expand his Bearwood Estate in 1873. The clay which was excavated to construct the lake was used to make bricks. In the 1930s, the area became the California-in-England holiday camp, with attractions including a speedway track, but became a designated Country Park in 1980. The outflow from Longmoor Lake flows through Longmoor Bog, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) covering , notable because it is one of the few base-poor valley mires in Berkshire. It includes an area of wet heathland, where peat sits on top of an underlying layer of clay, resulting in a ferruginous swamp, characterised by rust-coloured iron bacteria. Around the waterlogged mire are carrs of alder, grey willow, downy birch and alder buckthorn, while the swamp is populated by purple moor grass and cross-leaved heath.", "At the western edge of Longmoor Bog, the brook is crossed by Park Lane, and turns to the north along the perimeter of the former Arborfield Garrison, which closed in 2015 to be re-developed for housing. After passing under Biggs Lane, it enters another lake, and then crosses open countryside to join the main channel, the combined flow continuing northwards until it is crossed by the B3349 Barkham Road. It is joined by a stream flowing westwards from the lakes at Barkham Manor. The grade II listed manor house was built on a moated site in the 17th century, and was enlarged in the 18th and 19th centuries, after which it was altered in the 20th century. It was the home of John Walter, and Mary Ball, the mother of George Washington, was born there. The brook continues to the north-west, and its flow is augmented by the treated effluent from Arborfield Sewage Treatment Works. The works is authorised to discharge 4.75 Ml per day into the river, but on 29 September 2013 discharged untreated effluent, resulting in serious pollution and the death of fish, other fauna and vegetation. Thames Water were fined \u00a3150,000 for that particular incident, as part of a much larger fine for five other incidents elsewhere.", "To the west of the works, the brook turns to the north, and passes under the B3030 Mole Road at Mole Bridge Farm, where there is a weir. Shortly afterwards, it is joined by the outflow from Bear Wood Lake, which is located in the grade II* listed parks and gardens belonging to Bearwood College. John Walter II bought the Bearwood Estate in the early 19th century, and employed J W Sanderson to build a classical villa. He also enlarged the lake to its present size of . Walter's son, John Walter III rebuilt the house between 1865 and 1874, employing Robert Kerr as the architect. In 1919 the building became the Merchant Seamen's Orphanage, and then a boarding school. The lake was created by constructing a compacted clay dam across the small stream than ran through the grounds. The catchment area for supplying the lake is very small, at only , encompassing the school grounds, a golf course, a large area of woodland and runoff from a small residential area. The lake was estimated to hold around 313.6 Ml, but this was increased to 327.2 Ml by raising the surface level by  in the 1990s. Historically, water from the lake powered a sawmill situated near the dam, which had ceased to operate by the 1960s. A pumping station is located on the crest of the dam, and water is abstracted for irrigation of the golf course. Because the volume of water impounded by the dam exceeds 25 Ml, the lake is considered to be a reservoir under the terms of the Reservoir (Safety Provisions) Act 1930, and visual imspections are made every week by a Reservoir Supervisor Engineer, while the crest of the dam is regularly surveyed for any signs of settlement of the dam, of which there were none as of 2014."]}]}}
