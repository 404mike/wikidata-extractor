They had barely threatened to qualify for the end of season play-offs, ending the 2000\u201301 campaign in 15th place, six points above the relegation zone. The 2001\u201302 season, with new manager Nigel Worthington in his first full season in charge, saw the team fare better and they reached the Division One play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Roberts missed much of the second half of the season because of injury, but came off the substitute's bench in the final to give Norwich the lead in the first minute of extra-time with a header. Norwich lost the match in a penalty shoot-out after Birmingham City had equalised. Roberts took \u2013 and scored \u2013 the first penalty of the shoot-out but misses by Phil Mulryne and Daryl Sutch meant Birmingham won 4\u20132 and were promoted to the Premiership."]}]}}
