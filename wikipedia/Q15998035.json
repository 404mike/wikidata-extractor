He played over 40 times for the county between 1903 and 1912. In a 1903 match against Monmouthshire, he took a hat-trick on his way to collecting six wickets for just nine runs. The following year, he took seven wickets against a London County Cricket Club side that included a few England Test cricketers of the past and future. His best return for Wiltshire came during a match against Dorset in 1908, when he took seven for 29 in the first innings of the match. Even in minor counties cricket, his batting was weak, though he did score half-centuries against Berkshire in 1907 and Buckinghamshire in 1908. After the end of his playing career, he joined the committee of Bath Cricket Club, and acted as a scorer for the first team. In February 1950 he and Henry Wood were made the first life members of Bath Cricket Club. He died on 12 January 1953, in Bath."]}]}}
