Because the ruling elite controls the production and distribution of the surplus product, it thereby also controls the state. In turn, this gives rise to a moral or religious ideology which justifies superior and inferior positions in the division of labour, and explains why some people are naturally entitled to appropriate more resources than others.

American Scientist published a review authored by Brian D. Hayden of Simon Fraser University, in which he described it as a \"very enjoyable\" book, praising the book's vignettes as making it \"eminently readable\". Although remarking that the authors' \"endorse cognitive interpretations that are quite different from the more economic and practical interpretations that I generally favor\", Hayden nevertheless commented that he agreed with their basic premise. He comments that while some of their assertions do seem plausible, others \u2013 for instance their claims that the idea of a tiered cosmos has a neurological basis \u2013 are less so, being the sort of \"speculative indulgences\" that he believes typify \"English archaeology\". Moving on to discuss the authors' views on the relationship between altered states of consciousness and power elites, he expresses his disagreement with them, noting that \"the issues of domestication and the emergence of socioeconomic complexity are poorly served by cognitively based explanations.\"Hayden 2006."]}, {"page": "Scarre", "response": ["*Chris Scarre, English archaeologist and writer"]}]}}
