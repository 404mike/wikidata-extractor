However, during his tenure as Chief of the General Staff (1985\u201389) General Sir Nigel Bagnall directed that British Military Doctrine was to be prepared, and tasked Colonel (later General) Timothy Granville-Chapman (an artillery officer who had been his Military Assistant in Headquarters 1st British Corps) to prepare it. The first edition of British Military Doctrine (BMD) was published in 1988. It led to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force developing their own maritime and air-power doctrines. However, in 1996 the first edition of British Defence Doctrine (BDD) was published, drawing heavily on the BMD. The Army adopted BDD as their Military Doctrine. The fourth edition of BDD was published in 2011; it uses the NATO definition of doctrine."]}, {"page": "Honourable Artillery Company", "response": ["* General Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman (2003\u20132010)"]}, {"page": "Order of the British Empire", "response": ["|General|| Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman||||2011"]}, {"page": "Master Gunner, St James's Park", "response": ["|General Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman GBE KCB ADC Gen"]}, {"page": "Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)", "response": ["| Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman GBE, KCB"]}, {"page": "Advanced Research and Assessment Group", "response": ["ARAG was established in 2005 by  CMG, the former principal advisor to the NATO Secretary General.  He realised that across the UK Ministry of Defence and wider government no organisation was either adaptable or innovative enough to research 21st Century security challenges. ARAG brought together experts from the military, academia and other fields in \"research clusters\" dedicated to specific areas of concern, in order to provide policy-makers with focussed analysis of international security issues. ARAG members were hand-picked and came from a wide background of skills, experience and nationalities.  ARAG subsumed the Conflict Studies Research Centre, previously known as the Soviet Studies Research Centre, which for nearly 40 years had studied the Soviet Union, working in open source organic languages to supplement MoD and Intelligence Service assets.  ARAG worked across government departments undertaking both directed and undirected research and broadening its reach to encompass new security challenges such as China, cyber security and strategic communication.  It produced a large number of research papers - made freely available to the public from the Defence Academy website - as well as more targeted limited distribution work.  Many of these papers became seminal reference works including Russia and The West: A Reassessment by Dr James Sherr, Charles Blandy's correct prediction of the Russian attack on Georgia, Professor James Pettifer's analysis of the Greek financial crisis and the joint paper by Major General Andrew Mackay and Commander Steve Tatham. Mackay is on public record as stating that ARAG was the only organisation in the MoD capable of helping him plan and write his operational design for his Brigade tour in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2007.  ARAG also administered the Defence Academy Reserve Cadre, a network of over 70 Reserve Forces personnel with unusual civilian skills sets or languages.  The Cadre personnel were designed to augment regular forces and other government departments in providing specialist civilian skills in operational areas.  They were also, at one point, the only part of the UK Defence Community directly assisting the UK Prevent agenda through their mentoring at the Active Change Foundation.  The cadre was described by then Vice Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman as a 'work of genius'."]}, {"page": "Aide-de-camp general", "response": ["| General Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman || 6 January 2003 || 29 October 2009 ||"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*General Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman (born 1947), Adjutant-General to the Forces, 2000\u20132003, Commander-in-Chief Land, 2003\u20132005, and Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff, 2005\u20132009"]}, {"page": "Clan Home", "response": ["A British Army unit \u2013 The 40th Regiment Royal Artillery (40 Regt RA) \u2013 had a longstanding association with Clan Home.  Until entering suspended animation as part of the 2010 SDSR, 40 Regt RA (The Lowland Gunners) bore the Home tartan on a number of dress items.  Every Officer and Soldier wore a Home Tartan rank slide; Officers wore Home Tartan trews with dinner jackets often in lieu of Mess Dress (unofficially referred to as 'Lowland Order') and the Regimental Pipes and Drums also wore Home tartan kilts, trews and other accoutrements.  After moving from Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, England to Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn, Northern Ireland as part of an Army wide rebasing plan in 2009, the regiment renamed its purpose-built technical accommodation 'Home Lines', formally opened by General Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman in 2010 at a ceremony attended by senior members of Clan Home.  Additionally, the Commanding Officer's designated residence was named 'Home House', the naming of which caused some perplexity years later amongst those unaware of the correct pronunciation and the relationship between the regiment and the clan!  Following the demise of 40 Regt RA, some of the Home linkages were taken forward to the Royal Artillery's other Scottish regiment, 19th Regiment Royal Artillery where they are carried on today."]}, {"page": "Richard Dannatt", "response": ["Dannatt was appointed Commander, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (COMARRC) on 16 January 2003 and promoted to lieutenant general the same day.

However, his term also coincided with an increase in the intensity of simultaneous operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Dannatt formed the view that government spending priorities did not accurately reflect the commitments of the British Armed Forces at the time.Dannatt, p. 233."]}, {"page": "Chapman (surname)", "response": ["*Timothy Granville-Chapman (born 1947), British Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff of the British Armed Forces"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*2007: Sir David Cooksey, Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Cross", "response": ["The first public presentation of an Elizabeth Cross was on 18 August 2009 in a ceremony at Catterick Garrison.
