Notts County started to come back into the match; Martindale headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure.

However, City went on to double their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked on a long pass from Richard Huxford with his first touch. His header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, Martindale fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.", "|CF ||10|| Tony Battersby || || "]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 18 || ST || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Tony Battersby"]}, {"page": "Battersby (surname)", "response": ["*Tony Battersby (born 1975), English footballer"]}]}}
