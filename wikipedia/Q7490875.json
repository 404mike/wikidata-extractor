The first hat-trick at the stadium was also the first hat-trick scored by a Brewers player in the Football League, achieved by Greg Pearson in a 6\u20131 victory over Aldershot Town on 12 December 2009.

Foster made his Stevenage debut in the club's first Football League fixture, a 2\u20132 draw against Macclesfield Town, playing the whole game in the centre of defence. After the Macclesfield game, Foster did not play in the first-team until late September 2010, coming on as a late substitute in Stevenage's 1\u20130 away win at Lincoln City. He then appeared as a 52nd-minute substitute in the club's victory over Burton Albion, but was sent-off for a foul on Shaun Harrad. Foster scored his first goal for Stevenage on 3 January 2011, scoring the first goal of the game in Stevenage's 4\u20132 home win over Barnet. Foster received his second red card of the 2010\u201311 season in a game against Northampton Town, for a foul on Seth Nana Twumasi, a game that Stevenage went on to lose 2\u20130. Stevenage appealed against the sending off, but the appeal was subsequently rejected. This ultimately meant that Foster had played his last game of the 2010\u201311 season, serving a four-match suspension that ruled him out of Stevenage's end of season 3\u20133 draw with Bury, as well as the club's subsequent play-off campaign. Foster played 23 times for Stevenage in his only season with the club, scoring once, and the team went on to win promotion into League One via the play-offs."]}, {"page": "David Flitcroft", "response": ["Flitcroft was appointed as manager of Bury on 9 December 2013, who were then 20th in League Two.
