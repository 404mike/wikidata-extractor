On the right the 151st Brigade took the front line positions in heavy fighting, but by dawn only four tanks had managed to cross the Wadi. The next day (21 March) reinforced by the 5th East Yorkshires, the brigade advanced and took three positions on the ridge and took several hundred Italian prisoners. More tanks had crossed over but most of them were armed only with the increasingly ineffective 2-pounder gun. The passage of these tanks had damaged the Wadi crossing and only a few anti-tank guns could be moved across. On 22 March, with the DAF grounded by rain, the Germans counterattacked with the 15th Panzer Division with supporting artillery and infantry. The 151st Brigade were withdrawn that night, the 5th East Yorkshires on the night of 23/24 March. The 6th D.L.I had started the battle with only 300 men, and was now reduced to 65 uninjured, and the other battalions were in a similar state. The 2nd New Zealand Division's flanking attack began on 26 March and was to force an Axis withdrawal.Delaforce 37\u201439"]}, {"page": "69th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)", "response": ["===Lieutenant Colonel Derek Anthony Seagrim, VC 20/21 March 1943==="]}, {"page": "Derek", "response": ["*Derek Anthony Seagrim (1903\u20131943), English soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (D)", "response": ["# Derek Anthony Seagrim"]}, {"page": "Derek A.
