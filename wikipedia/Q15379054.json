The evangelical Christianity of Scotland was influenced by the Haldane brothers, and it is known that at least later Oncken made contact with them. Oncken apparently arrived at a Baptist position on believer's baptism (and baptism by immersion) by degrees through personal Bible study. By 1829, though still a member of a church that taught infant baptism, he appears to have decided against it, for in that year he refused to present his child for the ceremony. He discussed the baptism issue with T. W. Matthews (his pastor), C. F. Lange (one of his first converts) and others. Matthews became convinced that he should be baptized by immersion, resigned from his church and traveled to England to be baptized. In 1829, Oncken corresponded with James Haldane of Scotland. Haldane recommended that Oncken baptize himself, as John Smyth had done. Oncken thought this was without Biblical authority, and said of Haldane's advice, \"Even great men are able to err.\" Oncken also corresponded with Joseph Ivimey.Joseph Ivimey was the author of .
