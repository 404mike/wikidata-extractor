She said that he used adolescent girls as his personal harem. \"Steve seemed to take it upon himself to initiate all the girls, and it was like we were his harem,\" she stated. She had not informed her parents or others in the community, she said, because she \"knew nothing would be done about it because of previous experience on the island.\" On the same day, another woman alleged that she had been raped twice as a school girl by Steve Christian. She had been a virgin at the time of the first rape, she said.", "On the next day (6 October), the prosecution produced a videotape of a police interview with Steve Christian, conducted at Auckland Central police station in New Zealand in 2000.

Christian agreed that it \"could be the case\" that he had sex with one girl of 13 and another of 15.
