(Enjoy What You Do)\" (1982) and Malcolm McLaren's \"Buffalo Gals\" (1982). More serious British artists were rapping live or recording amateur tapes in the early 1980s, but the first British hip hop tune released on record was \"London Bridge\" by Newtrament in 1984. Over the next few years, more UK hip hop and electro was released: Street Sounds Electro UK (1984), which was produced by Greg Wilson and featured an early appearance from MC Kermit, who later went on to form the Wilson produced Ruthless Rap Assassins; The Rapologists' \"Kids Rap/Party Rap\" (1984), but releases and national publicity were still rare. Mainstream radio did play British hip hop on occasion, and instrumental in giving the scene wider recognition were DJs such as Dave Pearce, Tim Westwood, and John Peel, but in this period it made very little impact on the mainstream charts. The scene remained predominantly underground depending on word of mouth and the patronage of pirate radio stations. The first UK record label devoted to releasing UK hip hop acts was Simon Harris' Music of Life label, founded in 1986. It was home to Derek B, the first UK rapper to achieve chart success. Music of Life went on to sign groups such as Hijack, the Demon Boyz, Hardnoise (later Son of Noise) and MC Duke. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2013 for example Massive Attack with trip hop, or Galliano with acid jazz. Hip Hop Connection, the first major British hip hop magazine, was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London \u2013  such as Blade, Black Radical Mk II and Overlord X \u2013 but many distinct scenes developed nationally."]}, {"page": "Boland", "response": ["*Derek Boland, better known as Derek B (1965\u20132009), British rap producer and artist"]}, {"page": "British hip hop", "response": ["While many early rappers from the UK, such as Derek B, imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British linguistic practices \u2014 Rodney P of the London Posse deliberately chose a London accent \u2013 although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap \"somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean\".Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

Silver Bullet's chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and Rebel MC were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity."]}, {"page": "Profile Records", "response": ["* Derek B"]}, {"page": "Hip hop", "response": ["By 1984, youth worldwide were embracing the hip hop culture.
