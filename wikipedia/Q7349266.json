Walsh was elected as his deputy when it became clear no one else wanted the job.  Labor had by then been in opposition in South Australia since 1933. The LCL, led by Sir Thomas Playford, ruled South Australia through a time of strong economic development and held power thanks to an electoral malapportionment known as the Playmander, in which rural areas were significantly overrepresented in the legislature. By this time, many South Australian Labor politicians had despaired of ever winning power, and considered the Deputy Opposition Leader's post to be a thankless, low-paying job."]}, {"page": "Mick O'Halloran", "response": ["After a failed bid to re-enter the Senate at the 1937 federal election, O'Halloran returned to state parliament at the 1938 election, as the member for Frome, based around the area north of Port Pirie. An eccentric, O'Halloran forbade any Labor people to enter Frome or campaign there and it became known as his personal fiefdom. Despite this, or possibly because of this, O'Halloran comfortably retained Frome for the rest of his life, and succeeded Robert Richards as Leader of the Opposition on 10 October 1949. In the process he became the first Catholic to lead the South Australian Labor Party."]}, {"page": "1933 in Australia", "response": ["*Premier of South Australia \u2013 Lionel Hill (until 13 February), then Robert Richards (until 18 April), then Richard L.

With the Labor vote split three ways\u2014the official ALP, Premiers' Plan Labor, and Lang Labor\u2014the LCL won a resounding victory, taking 29 seats against only 13 for the three competing Labor factions combined.

In the lead up to the 1933 election Hill continued to quarrel with his cabinet colleagues, leading to his resignation from parliament and the Premiership on 13 February 1933 to controversially assume the position of South Australian Agent-General in London, leaving his successor Robert Richards with the unenviable task of leading the state until the election.  At that election, the Liberal and Country League\u2014formed a year earlier from the merger of the Liberal Federation and the Country Party\u2014won a sweeping victory. The three competing Labor factions\u2014the PLP, the official ALP and the Lang Labor Party\u2014were reduced to only 13 seats between them."]}, {"page": "Playmander", "response": ["The electoral system contributed to Playford achieving a then-world record for a democratically elected leader; he spent 27 years as Premier of South Australia.  During this period, as a result of population changes, the rural overweighting allowed Playford to hold onto power even when the LCL lost by decisive margins in actual votes.  In 1944 and 1953, for instance, Labor won 53 percent of the two-party vote to the LCL's 47 percent.  In most other parts of Australia with fairer electoral systems, this would have been enough to give the Labor leader--Robert Richards in 1944 and Mick O'Halloran in 1953\u2014a solid majority government. However, due to the Playmander, the LCL was still able to eke out a paper-thin majority in both elections.  Rural areas, excepting industrial towns such as Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie, were likely to support the LCL.  The Adelaide area was overwhelmingly Labor; even at the height of Playford's popularity, the LCL only had a realistic chance of winning seats in the wealthy \"eastern crescent\" and around Holdfast Bay."]}]}}
