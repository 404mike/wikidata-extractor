The signing of Nelson had an immediate impact with Yeovil recording their first clean sheet of the season in a 2\u20130 victory over Coventry City, on 26 August, with Rhys Browne scoring his first for the club and Olomola scoring his fourth of the season. On 29 August, Yeovil rounded off the month with a trip to Exeter City for their first match in the EFL Trophy group stages. The Glovers secured a 3\u20131 win with all the goals coming in the second half, a goal from Sam Surridge,  his first for the club, was followed by goals for Rhys Browne and Otis Khan. Deadline day saw Yeovil complete the signing of Bournemouth midfielder Matt Worthington on loan until January.", "The third match of the month finished with a 2\u20131 loss at Huish Park, against Swindon Town, with Yeovil having taken the lead after just four minutes, with a goal from Rhys Browne. Yeovil then faced league leaders Notts County, on 21 November, a Fran\u00e7ois Zoko penalty was enough to earn a 1\u20131 draw, despite a late red card for defender Sid Nelson for violent conduct. The Glovers then traveled to Wycombe Wanderers but two goals in the space of six first half minutes saw Yeovil consigned to yet another away defeat with Zoko grabbing what turned out to be a consolation goal as Yeovil lost 2\u20131. Yeovil's final match of the EFL Trophy group stage saw them triumph 2\u20131 against League One side Plymouth Argyle, with Tom James scoring his first goal for the club, and Bournemouth loanee Sam Surridge scoring his fifth goal of the season. The result was enough to see Yeovil top their group and qualify for the second round.", "Yeovil started the new year with a home fixture against Crawley Town, despite taking the lead through Sam Surridge the Glovers lost the match 2\u20131 having been reduced to nine men with both Connor Smith and Omar Sowunmi being sent off. The first week of the January transfer window saw a high turnover of players with the loans of Sid Nelson, Olufela Olomola and Matt Worthington expiring while the loan of Keston Davies was terminated after he had failed to break into the Yeovil side. The four loans were replaced with Liverpool defender Corey Whelan, Barnsley midfielder Jared Bird, Middlesbrough attacking midfielder Lewis Wing and Southampton striker Marcus Barnes all joining the club on loan until the end of the season from their respective clubs. On 6 January, Yeovil faced League One side Bradford City in the third round of the FA Cup. Despite being the lowest ranked team left in the competition, Yeovil won the match 2\u20130 with a goal from Marcus Barnes on his debut and a third of the season from Jordan Green enough to see Yeovil through to the fourth round for only the fourth time in their history. Yeovil then faced Forest Green Rovers in the third round of the EFL Trophy, and secured back-to-back 2\u20130 wins with goals from Nathan and Connor Smith enough to secure qualification to the quarter-finals of the competition. Having established himself in the Yeovil team, attacker Jordan Green was rewarded with a new contract until the summer of 2019, while defender Tom James also signed an improved contract. On 13 January, Yeovil drew 1\u20131 away at relegation rivals Port Vale, with Fran\u00e7ois Zoko scoring his tenth goal of the season to give the Glovers the lead but they conceded in the final five minutes to drop two points. The following week saw the club confirm that they had received a \"substantial bid\" for winger Otis Khan which had met a release clause in his contract, and that there had also been interest in defender Omar Sowunmi. On 20 January, Yeovil faced Chesterfield in a relegation six-pointer, after falling behind against the run of play Lewis Wing equalised with a 25-yard looping shot, his first goal for the club. In the final minute of injury time after Otis Khan appeared to have his shirt pulled he stopped playing allowing Chestefield to go up the other end to score a late winner with Khan then being sent off for shoving referee Kevin Johnson. Yeovil appealed the decision to send the midfielder off, but the appeal was deemed frivolous and Khan's ban was subsequently extended to five matches.", "|Sid Nelson|| v Notts County, 21 November||Violent conduct||3 matches||Wycombe Wanderers (A), League Two; Port Vale (A) FA Cup; Lincoln City (H), League Two"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Millwall F.C. season", "response": ["|15||Sid Nelson||CB||||Lewisham||||38||0||Academy||1 July 2013||Trainee||2018", "| 21 August 2017 || CB ||  || Sid Nelson || Yeovil Town || 1 January 2018 || ", "| 4 January 2018 || CB ||  || Sid Nelson || Chesterfield || 30 June 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Millwall F.C. season", "response": ["| ||Sid Nelson||CB||||Lewisham||||38||0||Academy||1 July 2013||Trainee||2019", "| 2 August 2018 || CB ||  || Sid Nelson || Swindon Town || January 2019 || ", "| 29 January 2019 || CB ||  || Sid Nelson || Tranmere Rovers || 31 May 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Sid Nelson", "| 2 August 2018 || CB ||  || Sid Nelson || Millwall || 1 January 2019 || ", "|align=\"left\"| Sid Nelson"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 29 January 2019 || CB ||  || Sid Nelson || Millwall || 31 May 2019 || "]}]}}
