A child prodigy, she started playing the piano at the age of sixteen months, and performed in public for the first time before she was two years old. Randles was taught by her blind father, who was organist at the Holywell parish church. She performed for local aristocracy, leading to a performance for King George III and his royal family when she was three and a half. Caroline, Princess of Wales, hoped to adopt her but her father did not allow it. She did, however, spend a few days at the Princess of Wales' summer home, often playing with Princess Charlotte of Wales. Randles went on to tour the country as a child, performing with John Parry. In 1808, she returned home and learned the harp. She went on to take lessons from Friedrich Kalkbrenner, before moving to Liverpool and becoming a teacher.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1820s in Wales", "response": ["**June \u2013 Elizabeth Randles, harpist (b. 1801)"]}, {"page": "1829 in Wales", "response": ["*June - Elizabeth Randles, harpist, 28?"]}, {"page": "1801 in Wales", "response": ["*24 May(probable) - Elizabeth Randles, harpist and pianist (d. 1829)"]}, {"page": "1800 in Wales", "response": ["*1 August - Elizabeth Randles, musical prodigy (d. 1829)"]}, {"page": "Randles", "response": ["*Elizabeth Randles (1800\u20131829), Welsh child prodigy harpist and pianist"]}, {"page": "List of harpists", "response": ["* Elizabeth Randles"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Elizabeth Randles (c.1801\u20131829), harpist and pianist "]}]}}
