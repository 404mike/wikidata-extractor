The sport of cricket in this period had already acquired most of its modern features such as eleven-a-side, the three-stump wicket and the lbw law, although pitch preparation was rudimentary and play was largely dictated by the weather. The main difference was in bowling which was still mostly underarm, the key development of the period being the movement towards roundarm bowling which began in the late eighteenth century and was gathering pace by 1825.\nThe principal club throughout the period was Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in 1787. MCC organised the early Gentlemen v Players matches and most of the games played by occasional XIs such as those led by Colonel Lennox, Lord Frederick Beauclerk, George Osbaldeston and others. Inter-county cricket was rare during the Napoleonic Wars and there were no formally constituted county clubs at the time, but the main centres at county level were Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex. Towards the end of the period, Cambridge University became prominent, especially through its series of matches against the Cambridge Town Club. In the north of England, cricket was developing through town clubs which became the focal points of the game in their respective counties, especially Nottingham Cricket Club and Sheffield Cricket Club.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1787 and 1825 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Spencer", "response": ["This is a list of people with surname Spencer.", "* Abigail Spencer (born 1981), American actress", "* Adam Spencer (born 1969), Australian radio presenter, comedian, and media personality", "* Adriano Spencer (1959\u20132006), Portuguese footballer", "* Alan Spencer, American television writer and producer", "* Alan Spencer (cricketer) (born 1936), English cricketer", "* Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer (1892\u20131975), British peer", "* Albert Spencer (footballer) ( 1920s), English footballer", "* Alberto Spencer (1937\u20132006), Ecuadorian football player", "*Alf Spencer, English footballer", "* Ambrose Spencer (1765\u20131848), American lawyer and politician", "* Andre Spencer (born 1964), American basketball player", "* Anna Garlin Spencer (1851\u20131931), American educator, feminist, and Unitarian minister", "* Anne Spencer (disambiguation), multiple people, including:", "**Anne Spencer (1882\u20131975), American poet", "**Anne Spencer, Countess of Sunderland (1683\u20131716)", "**Anne Spencer, Countess of Sunderland (died 1715)", "**Anne Spencer (WRNS officer) (1938\u20132012), director of the Women's Royal Naval Service", "* Aubrey Spencer (1795\u20131872), Anglican Bishop of Jamaica", "* Baldwin Spencer (born 1948), Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda", "* Baldwin Spencer (anthropologist) (1860\u20131929), worked in Australia", "* Barb Spencer (born 1966), Canadian curler", "* Barbara J.
