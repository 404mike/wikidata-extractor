The youngest of four children, she had three older brothers and a stern father who made her keenly aware of her position as a girl.Sue Watling, \"Pauline Boty: Pop Painter\" in Sue Watling and David Alan Mellor, The Only Blonde in the World: Pauline Boty (1938\u20131966), [exhibition catalogue] Whitford Fine Art & The Mayor Gallery Ltd. (London: AM Publications, 1998), p. 1. In 1954 she won a scholarship to the Wimbledon School of Art, which she attended despite her father's disapproval. Boty's mother, on the other hand, was supportive, having herself been a frustrated artist and denied parental permission to attend the Slade School of Fine Art.Watling, pp. 1\u20132. Boty earned an Intermediate diploma in lithography (1956) and a National Diploma in Design in stained glass (1958). Her schoolmates called her \"The Wimbledon Bardot\" on account of her resemblance to the French film star Brigitte Bardot. Encouraged by her tutor Charles Carey to explore collage techniques, Boty's painting became more experimental. Her work showed an interest in popular culture early on.Watling, pp. 2\u20133 In 1957 one of her pieces was shown at the Young Contemporaries exhibition alongside work by Robyn Denny, Richard Smith and Bridget Riley.", "Her unique position as Britain's only female Pop artist gave Boty the chance to redress sexism in her life as well as her art. Her early paintings were sensual and erotic, celebrating female sexuality from a woman's point of view. Her canvases were set against vivid, colourful backgrounds and often included close-ups of red flowers, presumably symbolic of the female sex.David Alan Mellor, \"The Only Blonde in the World\", in Watling and Mellor, p. 21 She painted her male idols\u2014Elvis, French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, British writer Derek Marlowe\u2014as sex symbols, just as she did actresses Monica Vitti and Marilyn Monroe. Like Andy Warhol, she recycled publicity and press photographs of celebrities in her art. Her 1963 portrait of her friend Celia Birtwell, Celia and Her Heroes, shows the textile designer surrounded by a Peter Blake painting, a David Hockney portrait and an image of Elvis Presley. She exhibited in several more group shows before staging her first solo exhibition at Grabowski Gallery in the autumn of 1963. The show was a critical success. Boty continued to take on additional acting jobs. She was a presenter on the radio programme Public Ear in 1963\u201364, and in the following year, she was typecast yet again in the role of 'the seductive Maria' in a BBC serial."]}, {"page": "Mellor", "response": ["* David Alan Mellor, curator and art historian"]}, {"page": "Ivan Tyrrell", "response": ["Two silk-screen posters produced with fellow artist Frederick Carver featured in Les Sixties, a Paris exhibition of psychedelic art that then transferred to the Brighton Festival and... \u201cthe spectral, hallucinatory scenarios of J.G.
