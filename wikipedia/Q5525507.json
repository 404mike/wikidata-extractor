The Saints largely edged out the home side throughout the game, with more possession and chances on goal, but it took until after the hour mark to break the deadlock when defender Radhi Ja\u00efdi headed in a corner from Guly do Prado, who had only come on as a substitute three minutes earlier. Charlton increased the pressure in the last 20 minutes, and former Saints player Bradley Wright-Phillips equalised the game in the 86th minute to crush Southampton's hopes of moving into the League One promotion places. After a two-week break, Southampton returned to St Mary's to face Milton Keynes Dons on 2 April 2011 and won 3\u20132. The visiting side were on top for most of the first half, and opened the scoring in the 34th minute when Gary MacKenzie headed in a Peter Leven corner. The Dons doubled their lead early in the second half courtesy of Sam Baldock, but after Jonathan Forte came on for the Saints shortly after the hour mark the dynamic of the game changed: Forte scored two goals in the space of two minutes, bringing Southampton level and giving them a chance to make the game their own. It only took another ten minutes for the home team to score another and take the lead, this time courtesy of Lee Barnard latching onto a Rickie Lambert assist. Southampton held out for the victory, and remained third in the table with three games in hand over Huddersfield and two over Brighton.

Leyton Orient were reduced to ten men in the first-half, with Ben Chorley receiving a red card for an off-the-ball incident with Chris Beardsley. Stevenage substitute Chuks Aneke was also sent-off in the second half for a high-footed challenge. In the week prior to Stevenage's trip to Rochdale, speculation mounted as to whether Stevenage manager Graham Westley would remain at the club amidst interest from fellow League One side, Preston North End. Westley eventually joined Preston on 13 January, leaving the club after three-and-a-half years in charge. Westley took his back-room staff with him to Preston, meaning captain Mark Roberts was named as player-manager for the club's trip to Spotland on 14 January. The game ended 5\u20131 to Stevenage. Luke Freeman, playing his first game since signing for the club on a permanent basis, scored the opening goal when his shot squirmed under Rochdale goalkeeper P\u00e9ter Kurucz. Shortly after the interval, Stevenage had doubled their advantage when Freeman beat his man down the left, before laying the ball to Chris Beardsley, who in-turn rolled the ball to the onrushing Lawrie Wilson, who scored with a first-time finish. Rochdale reduced the two-goal deficit when loanee Brett Ormerod finished well from Daniel Bogdanovic's driven cross. Stevenage restored their two-goal advantage almost instantly, Lawrie Wilson ran onto Mark Roberts' ball, before finishing neatly past Kurucz. Rochdale defender Joe Widdowson was given a second yellow card shortly after for a foul on Beardsley. Five minutes later, the visitors had a fourth goal, Freeman cut in from the right wing and unleashed a 25-yard drive into the top corner of the goal. Freeman was again involved in Stevenage's fifth goal, whipping in a cross from the left that Byrom side-footed home. Roberts remained in charge for the club's trip to Scunthorpe United a week later, on 21 January, with the game ending in a 1\u20131 draw. Scunthorpe took the lead shortly after the half-time interval, with Garry Thompson collecting a Mark Duffy long ball before firing into the net from 12-yards out. Substitutes Robin Shroot and Darius Charles combined to ensure Stevenage earned a point from the match, with Shroot bringing down Lawrie Wilson's cross into the path of Charles, who turned quickly to beat the outstretched Sam Slocombe from six yards. Stevenage returned to Broadhall Way three days later, after three successive away fixtures in all competitions, hosting Milton Keynes Dons. The away side took the lead after just two minutes, when former Stevenage loanee Jay O'Shea finished from close range after Chris Day had palmed away Adam Smith's cross. Stevenage drew level midway through the first-half following a neat interchange between Luke Freeman and Lawrie Wilson, with Freeman laying the ball off to Michael Bostwick, who unleashed a 25-yard strike into the bottom left corner of the goal. On the hour mark, MK Dons defender Mathias Doumb\u00e9 was sent-off for a second bookable offence after bringing down Chris Beardsley on the edge of the area. Stevenage took the lead from the resulting free-kick, with Scott Laird heading in Freeman's cross. The hosts had doubled their advantage three minutes later, Freeman again supplying the cross that was met by the head of Darius Charles, who firmly headed past MK Dons goalkeeper David Martin. With five minutes remaining, MK Dons scored their second goal of the game, with O'Shea crossing the ball for substitute Tom Flanagan to head into the net from six yards. Stevenage restored their two-goal advantage almost instantly when Charles worked his way into the box before firing the ball across the face of the goal, which was turned in by MK Dons defender Gary MacKenzie."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["The start of 2012 was highly anticipated by Sheffield Wednesday with knowledge of the possibility of being promoted to the Football League Championship at the end of season in May. The key aim was to gain automatic promotion and that was a task that had so far in the first half of the season been greatly helped by on loan winger Ben Marshall, who had probably been the best player for The Owls so far. However, the thing on all the fans' minds was Marshall's future at the club, as his loan from Stoke City was due to end during the middle of the month and his contract at Stoke City due to end in the summer. Only being 20 years of age, it was made clear by Gary Megson, known to be great friends with Stoke City manager Tony Pulis, the outcome would either be that 'Marshall will either sign a new contract at Stoke City and hopefully come back on loan to us (Sheffield Wednesday) or another club will snap him up and buy him'. Wednesday had a match to concentrate on however and their first game of 2012 came at home to Tranmere Rovers. The home game was first of four in a row for Wednesday. Sheffield Wednesday got off to a great start when Reda Johnson scored on just the second minute, then five minutes later Chris Lines scored his first home goal of the club to put The Owls 2\u20130 up. The game relaxed after this until the eighty-second minute when Ian Goodison scored from a corner to put a nervous last ten minutes of the game, with Sheffield Wednesday losing points in the final minutes of games just weeks earlier. However, Sheffield Wednesday managed to hold on and the game finished 2\u20131. On the Thursday after this game left back Mark Reynolds who had played only a few games since he joined the club at the beginning of the season was sent out on loan till the end of the season to Aberdeen. Sheffield Wednesday faced top of the Football League Championship West Ham United in the FA Cup the following weekend. Both teams made changes and was a very tight encounter even though the odds were stacked up on West Ham United to go through to the next round. It took a late goal to separate the sides when Chris O'Grady scored with two minutes to go of the ninety and sent Sheffield Wednesday through to the next round of the competition. The next day Sheffield Wednesday found they would be playing Blackpool away in Round 4 of the competition. With the transfer market open for the January month The Owls made their first signing when Miguel Llera, who had signed on loan for the month previously, signed on a two-year contract on a free transfer from Blackpool. Also, the club saw the introduction of Mike Jones a winger signed on an undisclosed fee for two-and-a-half years from fellow League One club Bury. In terms of departures, the club saw three when young goalkeeper Sean Cuff was sent out on loan to Cambridge United for a month, out-of-contract James O'Connor left for American club Orlando City, and Giles Coke went back on loan to Bury for the rest of the season. Back to matches and Sheffield Wednesday faced their toughest opponent of the season so far when the played top of the league Charlton Athletic at home, Charlton Athletic were five points clear of second place Sheffield Wednesday and had not dropped from the top of the league since October. The first goal was largely expected to be the key goal and the team who would go on to win the game. Sheffield Wednesday, unbeaten at home throughout the season and only having two draws at Hillsborough Stadium, started slightly on the back foot in front of a crowd of over 26,000 and were the first to concede when Charlton Athletic captain Johnnie Jackson curled a free-kick around the wall and into the net. That turned out to be the only goal of the game and Sheffield Wednesday were ended of their unbeaten run since the beginning of the season at home. Although with much of the season to go, the game was likely to end any chances of Sheffield Wednesday winning the league with Charlton Athletic now eight points clear of second place and Wednesday slipping down to fourth place with city rivals Sheffield United taking up second place four points ahead of The Owls, although they had played one extra game. The final of the four straight home games was against Hartlepool United and after a goalless first half it was Peter Hartley's goal that put Hartlepool United ahead two minutes into the second half. It took a goal by Jermaine Johnson when he took on four players on the right flank before finishing into the far, low bottom corner to put Sheffield Wednesday back on level terms. That goal lifted the fans in the stadium and the players reacted and scored a second with fifteen minutes to go with Gary Madine on the score sheet this time. However, again The Owls opted to start to defend their lead and then what seemed to be a goal out of nothing from outside the box and caught the keeper off his line, as Antony Sweeney's eighty-eighth minute effort meant Sheffield Wednesday could only manage a draw. With Wednesday reaching Round 3 of the FA Cup it meant that the game they would have played in the league on that same weekend was rescheduled to mid-week. This game was rescheduled to 24 January and was away to Scunthorpe United. After two disappointing results in a row Sheffield Wednesday were looking to bounce back. Sheffield Wednesday did exactly that when Chris O'Grady scored in under a minute after a long ball from Miguel Llera found the striker. Sheffield Wednesday then doubled their lead seventeen minutes later as Chris O'Grady grabbed his second. In the second half there was another goal from Jermaine Johnson, when he took on three players after running from the half-way line and slotted the ball coolly into the net when he found himself one-on-one. Jordan Robertson did pull one back for Scunthorpe United from a corner, but the game did finish 1\u20133 to The Owls. Sheffield Wednesday's next trip was in the FA Cup against Blackpool. Gary Megson made many changes to the side as he wanted to rest his key players ready for the tough mid-week tie in the league against fifth place MK Dons. One of those changes was striker Clinton Morrison who put The Owls unexpectedly ahead on the fifty-second minute. However, Sheffield Wednesday conceded yet another late, late goal, this time it was in the last minute of stoppage time again when Sheffield Wednesday conceded a penalty and Kevin Phillips scored from the spot in the ninety-minute, meaning a replay had to be played \u2013 something that neither team wanted due to their league focuses. The draw for the FA Cup saw the winner of the replay to play Premier League side Everton in the fifth round of the competition. After this Tottenham Hotspur young midfielder John Bostock join The Owls on loan until the end of the season. Mid-week and the last day of the month saw Sheffield Wednesday away to fifth place Milton Keynes Dons. Sheffield Wednesday were six points ahead of Milton Keynes Dons in fourth place; however they had played one more game than Milton Keynes Dons. An effort from distance saw the ball hit the bar and then hit goalkeeper Stephen Bywater's leg and roll into the net, giving Milton Keynes Dons the lead after seventeen minutes. Ten minutes later however a corner for Sheffield Wednesday saw Gary MacKenzie put the ball into his own net after the ball bounced off his knee, making it two own goals in the game. The game finished 1\u20131 and as a result Sheffield Wednesday went home happy with. However, the bad news of the month was Sheffield Wednesday were unable to extend key player Ben Marshall's loan until the end of the season. Marshall had made twenty-two appearances for the club, scoring five goals, and was signed by Football League Championship club Leicester City for over a million pounds. The loss of Marshall could have affected the team coming up to the 'business' and most crucial part of the season, and with Sheffield Wednesday only winning one of their last four gains with Ben Marshall, how much of an effect would his loss have on Sheffield Wednesday's automatic promotion hopes?"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Dundee F.C. season", "response": ["||| DF|| Gary MacKenzie", "|=|| ||Gary MacKenzie"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["Paul Ince's first victory came on 9 March, at Watford, thanks to goals from Ince junior and Gary MacKenzie.", "Blackpool made the short trip to Blackburn Rovers on 29 March.
