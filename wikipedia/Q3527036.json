Pougher was awarded a benefit by Leicestershire in 1900. He also played one Test match for England, which was against South Africa in Cape Town in 1891-92.\nHis greatest moment came when he took five Australian wickets for no runs in three five-ball overs with his deceptive off spin for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's in 1896. The tourists were bundled out for a humiliating 18.\nUnfamiliar with Pougher's bowling they failed to realise that he kept the ball lower and turned it less than seemed possible with his strong finger and wrist action.He umpired 49 first-class matches. All but two of these were between 1903 and 1909; the exceptions were one match in Australia in 1888-89 and Leicestershire's game against the West Indians in 1923.\nHe also officiated in Yorkshire's game against Kent in July 1904, but this match is not included in the total, as he and fellow umpire William Shrewsbury (brother of Arthur) declared the match void after the first day because of illegal changes made to the pitch.His name is pronounced 'Puffer'and after retirement from cricket, he kept the Old Cricket Ground Hotel at Aylestone Park, Leicester.", "link_mentions": {}}}
