Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first vacuum cleaner in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper instead of a vacuum cleaner, his machine did, in fact, have a rotating brush like a traditional vacuum cleaner which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism on top of the body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first vacuum cleaner on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric vacuum cleaner in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized vacuum cleaner in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable vacuum cleaner was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag."]}, {"page": "Fielding & Platt", "response": ["In 1902 Fielding & Platt manufactured the first vacuum cleaner, designed by Hubert Cecil Booth, also of Gloucester."]}, {"page": "Hubert booth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hubert Cecil Booth"]}, {"page": "Cecil Booth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hubert Cecil Booth"]}, {"page": "List of vacuum cleaners", "response": ["* Hubert Cecil Booth \u2013 invented the first powered vacuum cleaner"]}, {"page": "August 1901", "response": ["* British inventor Hubert Cecil Booth patented the first motorized vacuum cleaner, after concluding that if a motor could blow air to disperse dust, it could also be reversed to suck dust into a container.
