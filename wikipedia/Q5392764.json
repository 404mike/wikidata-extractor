Stakes and expenses were guaranteed by the company and the match was arranged to be run on the Zambezi River on 18 August 1910. Arnst's brother went ahead of them on the river to shoot the crocodiles. The heat and the altitude affected both scullers but Arnst was the better of the two and he crossed the line in front of Barry to retain his title.", "Ernest Barry wanted another tilt at the title and challenged Arnst to a race to be held on the Thames (England).

Felton and Towns raced in January 1913 and the match was described as a midget verses a giant. Towns was much smaller and weighed less than Felton who won the race by four lengths. Yet because of high winds which blew Towns off course the question of whom was the better was not really answered. It was somewhat answered when Jim Paddon handsomely beat Felton by two minutes in a race held in February 1913. Thus Felton lost the local championship. Pearce and Felton had an actual race in Sydney in September 1914 for \u00a3200 a side but no championship was involved.

Barry had also served in the war but had been invalided in 1918 after suffering shell shock and shrapnel wounds. He suggested that he would need at least six months to get back to full fitness for a match. Barry at thirty-seven years of age knew he was nearing the end of his sculling career.
