In 2011, he signed for Championship club Burnley on a season-long loan which was made permanent in January 2012 for an undisclosed fee. He was named in the Championship PFA Team of the Year for two consecutive seasons in 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314. In 2014, he secured promotion with Burnley to the Premier League as the team finished runners-up in the Championship. A year later, he signed for Tottenham Hotspur for a \u00a33.5 million fee. After four years in North London, during which he became part of the squad that finished as runners-up in the 2019 Champions League final, Trippier joined Spanish side Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where he helped the team win the 2020\u201321 La Liga title. \nTrippier also represented England at all levels from under-18 to under-21, featuring in the 2009 UEFA European Under-19 Championship and 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He made his senior international debut in June 2017 and was part of the team that reached the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 19", "response": ["*  1990   \u2013 Kieran Trippier, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1990", "response": ["** Kieran Trippier, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Bury, Greater Manchester", "response": ["* Kieran Trippier, footballer for Newcastle United and England international."]}, {"page": "Gareth Southgate", "response": ["On 11 July 2018, Southgate's England side suffered a 2\u20131 defeat to Croatia during extra time in the semi-finals.

Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 scored the winner for Croatia in the second half of extra time. With England trailing, the match also saw England play the final ten minutes of extra time with ten men as Trippier suffered an injury after Southgate had already made his permitted substitutions.

The team also continued its good results before the World Cup, with a draw with Turkey and Portugal, with the same score 2\u20132, in addition to a difficult defeat against Spain 1\u20130 in the 85th minute. Despite this, in the World Cup, the performance of the team did not rise to the expected level, and was once again eliminated from the group stage. The first match against England, the two teams had met in two matches, including one game at the 1998 FIFA World Cup group stage, an England 2\u20130 victory. England scored in the 11th minute when Mouez Hassen stopped a John Stones' header from a corner from the left, but could not save a Harry Kane follow-up from close range. Hassen was substituted four minutes later for Farouk Ben Mustapha due to an injury earlier in the game, after he had a collision with Jesse Lingard. Lingard then mishit a volley from Ashley Young's cross to the far post. After 10 minutes, Ferjani Sassi equalised from the penalty spot after Kyle Walker was penalised for an elbow on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. Kane had an appeal for a penalty waved away within five minutes of the restart as he was seemingly impeded by a pair of Tunisia players at a corner. In the additional time, Harry Maguire flicked a Kieran Trippier corner from the right into the path of Kane, who headed it inside the goal after being left free at the back post.The second match against Belgium, the two teams had faced each other in three matches, including one game at the 2002 FIFA World Cup group stage, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Just 6 minutes into the game, Syam Ben Youssef's late challenge on Eden Hazard was deemed, with the use of VAR, to have been just inside the area and he stepped up to score the penalty into the bottom-left corner. Ten minutes later, Dries Mertens won possession just inside the Tunisia half before driving forward and passing the ball to Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku then shot a low strike across Farouk Ben Mustapha into the bottom-right corner. Wahbi Khazri's free-kick from the left was met by Dylan Bronn, who flashed a header past Thibaut Courtois. Thomas Meunier found Lukaku inside the area, which he clipped over the onrushing Mustapha. Toby Alderweireld's long pass from defence was taken on the chest by Hazard, who then rounded Mustapha to stroke into an empty net. Michy Batshuayi met Youri Tielemans' cross at the back post with a controlled half-volley to score Belgium's 5th. Khazri scored deep into stoppage time after a swivel in the box. Tunisia, it has registered as their worst defeat ever in their World Cup history."]}, {"page": "Jay McEveley", "response": ["McEveley joined Championship side Barnsley on 6 July 2010, signing a two-year contract.

On 1 October 2011 against Cardiff City at the KC Stadium, Fryatt exchanged passes with Martin Pusic down the left before carrying the ball into the box, dropping his shoulder to get past a defender and finishing low past David Marshall at the near post. On 22 October 2011 against Watford at the KC Stadium, an error in the Watford box left the ball loose for Fryatt to fire home from close range. On 1 November 2011 against Barnsley at the Oakwell Stadium, Dele Adebola chested the ball down nicely into the path of Fryatt and the striker fired home into the bottom corner from the edge of the area. On 19 November 2011 against Derby County at Pride Park, Liam Rosenior advanced from right back all the way to the edge of the Derby box before feeding Matty Fryatt. He had beaten the offside trap and finished confidently past Frank Fielding. On 26 November 2011 against Burnley at the KC Stadium, Cameron Stewart received the ball tight to the left touchline, beat Kieran Trippier for skill and pace before crossing low for Matty Fryatt to finish from close range at the near post. A break-away started by Paul McKenna, passed through Robert Koren and fed to Fryatt resulted in the striker blasting home his second goal of the game, although Grant in the Burnley goal will surely have been disappointed with his attempts to keep the shot out. On 3 December 2011 against Leicester City at the KC Stadium, Cameron Stewart's persistence allowed him to poke a ball through to Aaron Mclean and although he should have got his shot away sooner, it didn't matter as he was brought down by Leicester captain Matt Mills. The referee pointed to the spot and the defender was promptly sent off. Fryatt stepped up to take the penalty and confidently beat Kasper Schmeichel. On 17 April 2012, Fryatt got his second hat-trick for the Tigers in the 3\u20131 home victory over Barnsley, the fourth in his overall career."]}, {"page": "List of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Kieran Trippier|| Atl\u00e9tico Madrid||\u00a320M||2019"]}, {"page": "Woodhey High School", "response": ["*Kieran Trippier, footballer currently playing for Atletico Madrid and brother of Kelvin Lomax"]}, {"page": "History of the England national football team", "response": ["England played Croatia in the semi-finals on 11 July.
