Pre-war forward Tommy Cheetham also left Griffin Park, so manager Harry Curtis strengthened the attack by re-signing Gerry McAloon from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Further signings came in the form of experienced half backs George Smith and Eric Jones. With excitement hard to come by in league play, Brentford's attention turned to the first FA Cup competition held since the 1938\u201339 season. Entering in the third round, the Bees battled through to the sixth round, equalling the club record, with Gerry McAloon scoring six goals in the eight matches played.

For 1946\u201347, the first Football League season since the end of the Second World War, manager Harry Curtis was able to call on many of his regular players from the final pre-war seasons, though the elder players, such as Irish international full back Bill Gorman, utility man Buster Brown and former Wales forward Idris Hopkins, were all at age 35. Long-serving forward and once-capped England international Billy Scott had remained with the club and was then aged 38. The team fielded versus Aston Villa on 1 February 1947 was the oldest in club history, with an average age of over 31.5 years. Curtis supplemented the squad by bringing in wing half Cyril Toulouse and forwards John Gillies, Maurice Roberts, Alan Smith and George Stewart. As in the final pre-war seasons, Curtis would also promote players from the Bees' reserve ranks, signing amateur Roddy Munro to a professional contract and handing debuts to Frank Latimer, John Moore and Wally Bragg, with Bragg going on to become the youngest-ever Brentford debutant at that time.", "|Frank Latimer", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Latimer"]}, {"page": "1951\u201352 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Frank Latimer", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Latimer"]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Frank Latimer", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Latimer"]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Frank Latimer", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Latimer"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Frank Latimer", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Latimer"]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Frank Latimer", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Latimer", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Latimer"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Frank Latimer", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Latimer"]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Frank Latimer (c)", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Latimer"]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["After finishing the previous season strongly, Brentford went into the 1955\u201356 Third Division South season full of optimism.
