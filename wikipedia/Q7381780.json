He briefly took charge of the club as caretaker manager during the 1994\u201395 season. Slade then had spells in charge of non-league sides Armitage and Leicester United before joining the coaching staff of Sheffield United in 1997. He had two spells as caretaker manager of The Blades in 1998 and 1999 before the appointment of Neil Warnock. In 2001, he took over the managerial post at Conference National side Scarborough before later moving to Grimsby Town in 2004 and Yeovil Town in 2006. He was appointed manager of Brighton & Hove Albion in 2009 but the stay was brief and he was dismissed in November 2009.\nIn 2010, Slade was appointed manager of Leyton Orient and he led the club to two 7th-place finishes, an FA Cup fifth round replay against Arsenal and took the O's to the Play-off Final in 2013\u201314 \u2013 a feat which saw win the LMA League 1 Manager of the Year award. He left Orient to take charge of Championship side Cardiff City, and spent two years in charge of the side, finishing in 11th and 8th positions before being appointed the club's head of football. He resigned from the role after only two weeks and, in June 2016, was appointed manager of Charlton Athletic.\nSlade has developed a reputation for being an effective man manager, and a very savvy operator within the transfer market who never bought a player whilst at Leyton Orient, instead bringing in a number of players on free transfers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlton Athletic F.C.", "response": ["After a slow start to the new season, with the club in 15th place of League One, the club announced that it had \"parted company\" with Russell Slade in November 2016.

The following season Robinson had the team challenging for the play-offs, but a drop in form in March led him to resign by mutual consent. He was replaced by former player Lee Bowyer as caretaker manager who guided them to a 6th-place finish, but lost in the play-off semi-final.", "| Russell Slade || June 2016\u00a0\u2013 November 2016||"]}, {"page": "October 10", "response": ["*  1960   \u2013 Russell Slade, English football manager"]}, {"page": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.", "response": ["*  Russell Slade 2009"]}, {"page": "Wokingham", "response": ["* Russell Slade, football manager"]}, {"page": "Yeovil Town F.C.", "response": ["At the beginning of the 2005\u201306 season manager Gary Johnson left Yeovil for Bristol City.

Around this time John Fry had bought all Dave Webb's share of the club, becoming Yeovil Town's new owner.

A good run in the League Cup saw Town beat Derby County away at Pride Park in round one, and defeat Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur at home in the second round, with Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala hitting an 87th-minute winner. The Mariners eventually suffered elimination by Alan Shearer's Newcastle United in the third round, losing 1\u20130 at home. Grimsby would fall out of the promotion places on the final day of the season and after defeating Lincoln City in the Play-off semi finals they would lose 1-0 to Cheltenham Town in the final at the Millennium Stadium.

During the 2007\u201308 season the club enjoyed a good run in the Football League Trophy and on 4 March 2008 Grimsby booked their place at the new Wembley Stadium after beating Morecambe in a two-legged Northern Final. A Paul Bolland goal in the away first leg was enough to see Town through. They went on to play MK Dons in the Final on 30 March, losing 2\u20130 after Danny Boshell missed an early penalty. The season ended with eight straight defeats. After a 13\u2013game winless streak in the league stretching from 22 March 2008, on 15 September 2008 Alan Buckley was sacked as manager for a second time. The board appointed Mike Newell as manager. The Mariners would finish 22nd in League Two narrowly avoiding relegation on the final day. Following another slow start to the season, and despite previous backings from the Grimsby Town board, on 18 October 2009 the club's official website declared they had sacked Mike Newell due to \"irretrievable breakdown\". Neil Woods was controversially made permanent manager on 23 November 2009. The other main candidate for the job was former boss Russell Slade, but the board decided upon Woods ahead of Slade. Almost immediately Woods was dealt a blow when the club decided to do a U-turn and sell captain Ryan Bennett to Peterborough United for \u00a3500,000 despite rejecting this offer in the summer and the player only recently signing a new four-year deal. Grimsby under Woods struggled and despite winning four and drawing one of their last six games to give them a chance of league survival going into the last game of the season., they were defeated 3\u20130 by Burton Albion, and thus were relegated from the Football League for the first time in nearly 100 years.", "After promotion, manager, Paul Hurst, released a number of players, many of whom were pivotal to the previous season's promotion push. On 24 October 2016, Paul Hurst was appointed as Shrewsbury Town manager, Chris Doig also left Grimsby and made Hurst's assistant at Shrewsbury, thus leaving Dave Moore and Stuart Watkiss as caretaker managers. On 7 November 2016, Marcus Bignot, then manager of non-League side, Solihull Moors, was officially announced as the new Grimsby Town manager, along with the appointment of Micky Moore as his assistant. During the January Transfer Window, Bignot brought in a total of 6 players permanently, including Solihull Moors midfielder, Jamey Osborne, and Gateshead midfielder, Sam Jones. Omar Bogle, Grimsby's top scorer at that point in the season, left the club for Wigan Athletic. On 10 April 2017, Marcus Bignot was relieved of his duties from the club. His replacement was Russell Slade, who joined the club for the second time as manager on 12 April 2017. Slade's assistant was former Grimsby player, Paul Wilkinson. The Mariners would finish 14th, with a total of 62 points.  Slade was sacked on 11 February 2018 after seeing the team fail to win in 12 league games, with eight losses, he left the team 17th in League Two. Paul Wilkinson took over as caretaker manager following the sacking. During this time, Grimsby faced further defeats against Cambridge United and Exeter City. Michael Jolley was appointed as the new manager on 2 March 2018 and twice secured Grimsby's Football League status as well as securing cup runs that culminated in an FA Cup tie away at Crystal Palace and a League Cup tie at Chelsea.

After Tommy Taylor left the club, Paul Brush spent two unsuccessful years in charge and after he was sacked, former player Martin Ling took over as manager in October 2003, with Orient second-bottom of the league. After several years of steady improvement, Leyton Orient gained promotion in the 2005\u201306 season, finishing in third place and gaining automatic promotion to League One. This was the club's first automatic promotion in 36\u00a0years and ended a period of 11 years in the English league's bottom division. This promotion season also saw an excellent FA Cup run, with Leyton Orient progressing to the fourth round after beating Premiership side Fulham. Promotion was only secured in the final minutes of the final game of the season, away at Oxford United; with the score tied at 2\u20132 and Orient seemingly destined to miss out yet again, news came through of a late goal scored against promotion rivals Grimsby Town F.C. that would potentially promote Orient. The Orient fans were still celebrating this when just 14\u00a0seconds later, Lee Steele scored to confirm Orient's promotion. The result also relegated Oxford to the Football Conference. Grimsby's manager that season was Russell Slade, who would later become Orient's manager.", "On 3 April 2010 Geraint Williams was sacked as manager after a 3\u20131 home defeat to fellow relegation strugglers Hartlepool following a poor run of form. Kevin Nugent once again took control for the 2\u20131 defeat at Southampton on 5 April and after the match Russell Slade was named as manager until the end of the season. With even less time to save Orient from relegation than Williams before him, Slade managed to bring about a change in form that saw Orient finish in 17th place, just one point but four places clear of relegation. In the summer of 2010 Slade's contract was extended for two years. After a poor start to the 2010\u201311 season, Orient's league form picked up towards Christmas, culminating in an 8\u20132 win against non-league Droylsden in an FA Cup second round replay. In a game described as \"the weirdest football match ever\", Orient had trailed most of the game 2\u20130 but scored six goals in extra time to progress into the third round. Orient then beat high-flying Championship side Norwich City 1\u20130 at Carrow Road to progress into the fourth round where they met another Championship side, Swansea City, at the Liberty Stadium. Orient beat Swansea 2\u20131 to set up a glamour fifth round tie against Premier League giants Arsenal at Brisbane Road, which finished in a 1\u20131 draw thanks to a late Jonathan T\u00e9hou\u00e9 equaliser for the O's. This set up a replay at the Emirates Stadium. Leyton Orient lost that replay 0\u20135, bringing to an end their longest run in the FA Cup since 1981\u201382. Either side of the Arsenal games, Leyton Orient achieved a club record-equalling 14\u00a0games unbeaten, putting the team just outside the play-off positions. However they were unable to maintain that momentum and ultimately missed out on the play-offs by just one point.", "The 2014\u201315 season saw a reversal of fortunes for Orient after the club was taken over by Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti. Long-standing manager Russell Slade left early in the season and was replaced by caretaker manager Kevin Nugent, followed in quick succession by Mauro Milanese and then Fabio Liverani before Christmas 2014. A disastrous second half of the season meant that Orient was relegated from League One after a 2\u20132 draw at Swindon Town on the final day.
