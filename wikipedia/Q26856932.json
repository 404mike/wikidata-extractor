In the late 1990s,  Louis's cousin Mirko Jamnicki-Dojmi di Delupis wrote an open letter where he denounced claims over Frankopan, \u0160ubi\u0107 and Zrinski names by his family and presented the family tree of Dojmi di Delupis containing 129 names from the year 1200 onwards.

It was written in a form of artificial Attic Greek. Anna described the political and military history of the Byzantine Empire during the reign of her father, thus providing a significant account on the Byzantium of the High Middle Ages. Among other topics, the Alexiad documents the Byzantine Empire's interaction with the Crusades and highlights the conflicting perceptions of the East and West in the early 12th century. It remains one of the few primary sources recording Byzantine reactions to both the Great Schism of 1054 and the First Crusade, as well as documenting firsthand the decline of Byzantine cultural influence in both eastern and western Europe. According to Peter Frankopan, the content of the Alexiad falls into five main categories."]}, {"page": "Tatikios", "response": ["The accusation of betrayal against Tatikios appears to be unjustified. The Byzantine general had left his personal possessions in the crusader camp and hence forfeited them. More conclusively, on 4 March 1098, a few weeks after the departure of Tatikios, a fleet bearing food supplies and siege materials for the crusader army outside Antioch arrived at the port of St Simeon. The modern historian Peter Frankopan suggests that Alexius was by now confident enough in the established links between Byzantium and the leaders of the crusade to retain his liaison officer in Constantinople for other duties."]}, {"page": "Leiden University Library", "response": ["Furthermore, an internationally prominent scholar is frequently appointed as \u2018Visiting Scaliger Professor\u2019 who delivers i.a. the Scaliger Lecture: Anthony Grafton (2009), Fran\u00e7ois D\u00e9roche (2010), Peter Frankopan (2017), Ted Underwood (2019)."]}, {"page": "Hereford Mappa Mundi", "response": ["* Discussion by Janina Ramirez and Peter Frankopan: Art Detective Podcast, 22 Mar 2017"]}, {"page": "Great Lives", "response": ["|Peter Frankopan, historian"]}, {"page": "The Museum of Curiosity", "response": ["*Peter Frankopan"]}, {"page": "Cundill Prize", "response": ["*Peter Frankopan (chair), Anne Applebaum, Lyse Doucet, Eliga Gould and Sujit Sivasundaram", "* Mark Gilbert (chair), Carol Berkin, Caroline Elkins, Peter Frankopan, Jeffrey Simpson"]}, {"page": "Ingrid Detter de Frankopan", "response": ["Detter married Louis Doimi de Lupis, a Croatian man later named Louis Doimi de Frankopan.
