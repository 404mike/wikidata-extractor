In 1764, Reynolds painted a joint portrait of James Paine father and son pictured above (now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The following year Reynold painted a matching portrait of Charlotte and her two daughters, Charlotte and Mary \"Polly\", possibly in exchange for in exchange for some of Paine\u2019s architectural work at his home. This portrait is now in Lady Lever Art Gallery, Liverpool. The portraits were intended to be hung so that the father and son faced mother and daughters. Reynolds\u2019s appointment book records an entry for their sittings:'17 July 1765 Mrs Pain , Miss Pain and Miss Polly Pain.' Then, on 25 July, 'Mrs Paine etc.' on 2 August 'Miss Paine' sat alone, and 'Mrs Paine' sat three days later. On 3 October the entry read: 'Mrs Paine & Co'.

It was eventually acquired by the art dealer C.J Wertheimer but when it was shown at Burlington House in 1908, it was catalogued as Portraits of the Misses Paine, their mother Charlotte having been painted out to increase its sale value. William Hesketh Lever paid \u00a34520. 5s for in 1918. In 1935, the Lady Lever Art Gallery Trustees took the decision to remove the over painting and restored Mrs Paine to her rightful place."]}, {"page": "1772 in art", "response": ["*Tilly Kettle \u2013 Dancing Girls (Blacks)"]}, {"page": "1786 in art", "response": ["** Tilly Kettle, portrait painter (born 1735)"]}, {"page": "George Bogle (diplomat)", "response": ["Returning to India, Bogle fulfilled the Panchen Lama's request to establish a temple on the banks of the Ganges, not far from the East India Company headquarters, where Buddhist monks could return to their spiritual roots in India. Although the ultimate goal of establishing a trade route to China was not met, a long-lasting relationship was formed between the British and the Tibetans. The mission to Tibet was viewed as a success, and was commemorated by a 1775 portrait of Bogle being presented (in Tibetan gowns) to the Panchen Lama. This portrait, by Tilly Kettle, a British painter who worked in Calcutta, was reputedly presented by Hastings to King George III and it is now in the Royal Collection."]}, {"page": "1776 in art", "response": ["* Tilly Kettle \u2013 The ceremony of a gentoo woman taking leave of her relations and distributing her jewels prior to ascending the funeral pyre of her deceased husband"]}, {"page": "An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump", "response": ["Wright met Erasmus Darwin in the early 1760s, probably through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when he stayed in the Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, it is more likely that this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar Circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle."]}, {"page": "1765 in art", "response": ["*Tilly Kettle \u2013 Portrait of Mrs. Yates as Mandane in 'The Orphan of China' (approximate date; Tate Britain)"]}, {"page": "1768 in art", "response": ["* Tilly Kettle becomes the first English painter to work in India."]}, {"page": "1735 in art", "response": ["** Tilly Kettle, English portrait painter (died 1786)"]}, {"page": "1760 in art", "response": ["*Tilly Kettle \u2013 Self-portrait, his first surviving painting"]}, {"page": "Sir Richard Kaye, 6th Baronet", "response": ["He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford graduating BCL in 1761.
