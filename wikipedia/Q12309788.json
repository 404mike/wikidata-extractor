She competed in the ninth series of The X Factor UK in 2012, and finished in sixth place despite being a strong favourite to win. She signed with Syco Music shortly after, and released her debut studio album, Chapter One (2014), which reached number one in the UK. The album spawned the chart-topping single \"Ghost\", as well as the top 20 singles \"Glow\" and \"Yours\".\nFollowing the successful collaborations, \"Glitterball\" with Sigma and \"Here for You\" with Kygo in 2015, Henderson went on a four-year hiatus. She returned to music in 2019 with the EP Glorious, and the singles \"This Is Real\" with Jax Jones, \"We Got Love\" with Sigala (both in 2019), and \"Let's Go Home Together\" with Tom Grennan (2021), two of which reached the top 10 in the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 12", "response": ["*1996 \u2013 Ella Henderson, English singer and songwriter"]}, {"page": "1996", "response": ["* January 12 \u2013 Ella Henderson, English singer"]}, {"page": "Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Ella Henderson (born 1996), singer and songwriter"]}, {"page": "1996 in music", "response": ["*January 12 \u2013 Ella Henderson, English singer and songwriter"]}, {"page": "List of singer-songwriters", "response": ["*Ella Henderson"]}, {"page": "Grimsby", "response": ["*Ella Henderson (born 1996), singer, songwriter and former contestant on The X Factor.
