About 1781 they settled in London where Andrew took up work as a manservant to Richard Cosway, who later trained him in portrait painting.Plimer specialised in portrait miniatures. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1768 to 1810 and in 1819. His most famous painting is of the three daughters of Sir John Rushout.  His brother Nathaniel Plimer also became a pupil of Cosway and a painter of miniatures.Plimer married on 21 February 1801, Joanna Louisa, daughter of John and Frances Knight of Wicken, Northamptonshire. The couple had one son who died in infancy and four daughters. He died in Western Cottages, Western Road, Brighton, Sussex, in January 1837 aged 73 and was buried on 4 February at Old Hove.His wife's younger sister Mary Ann Knight, another miniaturist, was a pupil and friend of Plimer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Cosway", "response": ["Cosway's pupils included Andrew Plimer (1763\u20131837)."]}, {"page": "Portrait miniature", "response": ["George Engleheart (1750\u20131829) painted 4,900 miniatures, and his work is stronger and more impressive than that of Cosway; it is often signed E or G.E. Andrew Plimer (1763\u20131837) was a pupil of Cosway, and both he and his brother Nathaniel Plimer produced some lovely portraits. The brightness of the eyes, wiriness of the hair, exuberance of colour, combined with forced chiaroscuro and often very inaccurate drawing, are characteristics of Andrew Plimer's work. John Smart (c. 1740 1811) was in some respects the greatest of the 18th-century miniaturists. His work was hailed by contemporaries for his excellence in refinement, power and delicacy; its silky texture and elaborate finish, and the artists love for a brown background.

A portrait by Allan Ramsay of a 'Lady Anne Rushout' is of a relative of an earlier generation.
