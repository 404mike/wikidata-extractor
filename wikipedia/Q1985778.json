He appears in Dante's Inferno in the lowest circle of Hell, set apart for traitors: \"him who, at one blow, had chest and shadow / shattered by Arthur's hand\" (Canto XXXII).Inferno, Canto XXXII, lines 61\u201362 (Mandelbaum translation). Mordred is especially prominent in popular modern era Arthurian literature, as well as in film, television, and comics.Torregrossa, Michael A., \"Will the 'Reel' Mordred Please Stand Up? Strategies for Representing Mordred in American and British Arthurian Film\" in Cinema Arthuriana: Twenty Essays (Rev. edn.), ed. Kevin J. Harty. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2002 (pb. 2009), pp. 199\u2013210. He has been portrayed on screen by Leonard Penn (The Adventures of Sir Galahad 1949), Brian Worth (The Adventures of Sir Lancelot 1956\u20131957), David Hemmings (Camelot 1967), Robert Addie (Excalibur 1981), Nickolas Grace (Morte d'Arthur 1984), Simon Templeman (The Legend of Prince Valiant 1991\u20131994), Jason Done (Merlin 1998), Craig Sheffer\u00a0(Merlin: The Return 2000), Hans Matheson (The Mists of Avalon 2001), and Asa Butterfield and Alexander Vlahos (Merlin 2008\u20132012), among others. In such modern adaptations, Morgause is often conflated with (and into) the character of Morgan le Fay, who may be Mordred's mother or alternatively his lover or wife. A few works of the Middle Ages and today, however, portray Mordred as less a traitor and more a conflicted opportunist, or even a victim of fate.The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 394.

Even after homosexuality was partially decriminalised in Britain in 1967, Bates rigorously avoided interviews and questions about his personal life, and even denied to his male lovers that there was a homosexual component in his nature. While throughout his life Bates sought to be regarded as a ladies' man or at least as a man who, as an actor, could appear attractive to and attracted by women, he also chose many roles with an aspect of homosexuality or bisexuality, including the role of Rupert in the 1969 film Women in Love and the role of Frank in the 1988 film We Think the World of You."]}, {"page": "1998 in film", "response": ["| Merlin || NBC / Hallmark Entertainment || Steve Barron (director); Edward Khmara, David Stevens, Peter Barnes (screenplay); Sam Neill, Helena Bonham Carter, John Gielgud, Rutger Hauer, Miranda Richardson, Isabella Rossellini, Martin Short, James Earl Jones, Billie Whitelaw, Lena Headey, Jason Done, Rachel De Thame, Mark Jax, Jeremy Sheffield, Sebastian Roch\u00e9, John McEnery, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Nicholas Clay, Robert Addie, Keith Baxter, Nickolas Grace, John Turner, Peter Woodthorpe ||  Action, Adventure, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "1999 in film", "response": ["| An Ideal Husband || Miramax Films || Oliver Parker (director/screenplay); Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, Peter Vaughan, Minnie Driver, Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam, John Wood, Ben Pullen, Marsha Fitzalan, Lindsay Duncan, Neville Phillips, Nickolas Grace, Simon Russell Beale, Anna Patrick, Delia Lindsay || Comedy, Romance || Live action"]}, {"page": "1988 in film", "response": ["*Salome's Last Dance, directed by Ken Russell, starring Glenda Jackson, Stratford Johns, Nickolas Grace, Douglas Hodge, Imogen Claire and Imogen Millais-Scott (U.K.)"]}, {"page": "1983 in film", "response": ["| Heat and Dust || Universal Studios / Curzon Film Distributors / Merchant Ivory Productions || James Ivory (director); Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (screenplay); Greta Scacchi, Shashi Kapoor, Julie Christie, Christopher Cazenove, Nickolas Grace, Zakir Hussain, Julian Glover, Susan Fleetwood, Patrick Godfrey, Jennifer Kendal, Charles McCaughan, Madhur Jaffrey, Barry Foster || Historical, Romantic, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Sleeping Murder", "response": ["*Nickolas Grace as Lionel Luff"]}, {"page": "Robin of Sherwood", "response": ["Michael Praed played Robin of Loxley in the first two series.
