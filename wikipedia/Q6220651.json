He also bowled off-spin, dismissing Ian Botham and Viv Richards several times. He succeeded Arnold Long as the County Captain of Sussex County Cricket Club in 1981 and led the team to second place in the County Championship. He was rated as one of the best county captains around and he was tipped for the Test captaincy. He was forced to retire in 1986, due to a finger injury.\nAfter his playing career ended he served as the Director of Cricket at the Friends of Arundel Castle Cricket Club, in tandem with the Arundel Castle Cricket Foundation (1986-2020).\nHe has been a successful tour manager, as he took the England Under-19's, the England A's and also managed the England team for two tours. \nHe briefly returned to management recently with the blind team, but he is now working for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).\nBetween 1986 and his retirement in 2020, he run a charity, the Arundel Castle Cricket Foundation for young cricketers and underprivileged children in Arundel, West Sussex. \nHe holds a number of posts, such as President of the Cricket Society and the English Schools Cricket Association. \nHe is a past Chairman of the Sussex Cricket Board and Chairman of Cricket for Sussex County Cricket Club. \nHe served as President of the Marylebone Cricket Club for 2009-10. \nHe is also a Governor of Dorset House School, Bury, West Sussex. \nHe is currently President of The Forty Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Barclay", "response": ["John Barclay may refer to:", "*John Barclay (Berean) (1734\u20131798), Scottish theological writer", "*John Barclay (clergyman) (1795\u20131826), Canadian Church of Scotland clergyman", "*John Barclay (cricketer) (born 1954), English/Hong Kong cricketer", "*John Barclay (rugby union) (born 1986), Scottish rugby union player", "*John Barclay (poet) (1582\u20131621), Scottish satirist and Latin poet", "*John Barclay (anatomist) (1758\u20131826), Scottish anatomist", "*John Barclay, Captain in Danish-Norwegian military, 1643 to 1645, thought to have been the first male member of Clan Barclay", "*John Barclay (mayor) (1749\u20131824), American soldier, politician, and jurist; mayor of Philadelphia in 1791", "*John Barclay, survivor of the shipwreck of HMS Birkenhead in 1852", "*John Barclay (Royal Marines officer) (1741\u20131823), British Royal Marines general", "*John Barclay (New Jersey politician) ( 1650\u20131731), Scottish Quaker and politician", "*John Barclay Armstrong (1850\u20131913), Texas ranger"]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 20th century", "response": ["*John Barclay (born 1954), cricketer and cricket manager"]}, {"page": "Walter Lawrence Trophy", "response": ["The Walter Lawrence Trophy is an annual award made to the player who has scored the fastest century in English domestic county cricket that season, in terms of balls received (not counting wides).

Despite this, once the partnership of Willey and Randell was broken, wickets began to fall at regular intervals, the only other notable contributions being 14 from Tony Greig and 15 from Phil Edmonds.

Brian Rose scored 14 runs from the first over, bowled by Imran, who later took Somerset's first wicket, bowling Denning before the batsman had scored a run. That brought Richards to the crease, and Long immediately changed both of his bowlers, replacing the quick bowling of the openers with the slower deliveries of Giles Cheatle and John Spencer. Cheatle dismissed Rose in his first over, caught down the leg side by the wicket-keeper, Long after scoring 44 runs. Peter Roebuck also got out to Cheatle, scoring nine runs before being caught by Mendis. Botham joined Richards in the middle, and immediately scored a four with a straight drive, followed by two hooks for sixes. Cheatle and Spencer each bowled their entire allocation of 12 overs without a break, and were followed by the introduction of another slow bowler, John Barclay. Although Richards finished as the competition's leading run-scorer, Woodcock said that he struggled to score fluently, particularly against the spin bowling of Barclay and Cheatle. In the Wisden Cricketers' Almanacks summary of the season, Jack Alridge praised Long's captaincy in the final, highlighting the use of slower bowling against Richards and Ian Botham as being particularly commendable.Preston 1979, pp. 547\u201348. Vic Marks, who also played in the match for Somerset, suggested that Botham was the only Somerset batsman to play with freedom, and said that the rest of the team were nervous and intimidated by the prospect of winning Somerset's first trophy.Marks 1984, pp. 61\u201363. Richards scored 44 runs, and Botham 80, including three sixes, but none of the rest of the middle- or lower-order batsmen made a significant score and Somerset finished their innings on 207 for 7.
