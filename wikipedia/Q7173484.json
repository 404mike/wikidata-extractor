His first job working in a factory was the stimulus for Smallcreep's Day. \nIn 1960, Brown was one of a small group who sat down and blocked the entrance of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Foulness. He was sentenced to six months in jail when he refused to agree not to repeat the action. In the following year he was one of the \"Eskimo Navy\" which boarded Polaris submarines in kayaks, resisting the establishment of the base at Holy Loch. He was a member of the Committee of 100 founded by Bertrand Russell to organise mass non-violent resistance to nuclear war.\nHe married in 1962, and his first child was born later that year.  The following year he moved to a small cottage in rural Gloucestershire, where he raised his four children.  He worked at various jobs locally, including Dursley's main factory, Lister's and Peter Scott\u2019s Wildfowl Trust in Slimbridge.  In 1966 he set up a craft pottery he called The Snake Pottery.  He later gave up employed work to concentrate on the pottery. In 1987 he separated from his wife and moved out of the cottage.\nIn 1980 Mike Rutherford released an album named after and inspired by Smallcreep's Day.\nSmallcreep's Day was republished in September 2008 by Pinter & Martin.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dursley", "response": ["The writer Peter Currell Brown wrote the cult classic 1965 surrealist novel Smallcreep's Day while working in Dursley."]}, {"page": "List of songs that retell a work of literature", "response": ["* The album Smallcreeps's Day by Mike Rutherford is based upon the novel of the same name by Peter Currell Brown."]}, {"page": "Peter Brown", "response": ["* Peter Currell Brown (born 1936), British novelist"]}, {"page": "Smallcreep's Day", "response": ["Smallcreep's Day is Peter Currell Brown's only novel and was first published by Victor Gollancz Ltd in 1965.

It is based on the 1965 novel Smallcreep's Day, the only book written by Peter Currell Brown. A satire on modern industrial life, the story follows Pinquean Smallcreep who has worked in the same factory for forty years and embarks on a journey of self-discovery as he follows its assembly line to find out what the factory produces. Brown had in fact worked in a factory for forty years himself. Rutherford had read the book roughly three years prior to starting work on the album, noting it had similarities to the Gormenghast series of fantasy novels by Mervyn Peake. Though he considered it \"hardly a great piece of literature\", he was more impressed with its spirit and the atmosphere it presented as a reader. He also chose the book as its story and setting were something he could work and develop from and adapted it to have a happy ending.Person, Lawrence (February 2009). Curiosities, Fantasy and Science Fiction. He later noted a strong contrast in themes between the factory and machine-oriented imagery on his album and the more romantic and fantasy-inspired Genesis songs typical of the time. Rutherford had attempted to pass lines from the book as lyrics, but abandoned the idea as they failed to work effectively."]}]}}
