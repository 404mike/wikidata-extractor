He was also their manager until 1975.\nMeehan founded Worldwide Artiste Management at No. 4 Leicester Street, London, in 1970 along with his father (also called Patrick), Wilf Pine and Malcolm Koss. Meehan Sr was a former stuntman who had roadied for Gene Vincent and worked with Small Faces manager Don Arden. As well as Black Sabbath, the group managed the progressive rock band Gentle Giant (remnants of 1960s pop band Simon Dupree and the Big Sound), Freedom (featuring original Procol Harum drummer Bobby Harrison), Black Widow, the Dutch band Cobra, Catapilla, Redbone and Mama Lion.\nThe company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in late 1970 after Black Sabbath became commercially successful. In 1971, Worldwide Artiste Management merged with Hemdale Ltd (named after founders, actors David Hemmings and John Daley) and moved to Mayfair. In 1973 Meehan launched the World Wide Artists (WWA) record label, which released albums by Black Sabbath, Gentle Giant, Snafu and The Groundhogs, with distribution by Phonogram. After 36 releases, the company closed in 1975.Meehan fell out with Black Sabbath in the late 1970s after a commercial and critical slump, and branched out into other areas of the entertainment business. He acquired HandMade Films in the late 1990s, becoming its executive chairman.In 2017, following an investigation by the Insolvency Service, three HandMade Limited directors were disqualified from acting as a director of a company: Patrick Anthony Meehan for 13 years, David Bernard Ravden for five-and-a-half years, and Peter William Parkinson for four years. The directors misused funds to \"pay off relatives\" and \"on matters undisclosed to advisers, shareholder or potential investors\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "HandMade Films", "response": ["New owner Paragon Entertainment Corporation restarted production under the HandMade name in 1996-1997.

The song \"Fluff\", an Iommi instrumental composition later released on the Sabbath Bloody Sabbath album, was played as Snowdon walked down the aisle. Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham was Iommi's best man for the ceremony. The marriage lasted for three years. Iommi said in a 1991 Guitar World interview that the troubled recording and mixing of Black Sabbath's 1976 album Technical Ecstasy contributed to the end of his marriage."]}, {"page": "Sabotage (Black Sabbath album)", "response": ["Sabotage is the sixth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released in July 1975. It was recorded in the midst of litigation with their former manager Patrick Meehan. The stress that resulted from the band's ongoing legal woes infiltrated the recording process, inspiring the album's title. It was co-produced by guitarist Tony Iommi and Mike Butcher.", "\"The Writ\" is one of only a handful of Black Sabbath songs to feature lyrics composed by vocalist Osbourne, who typically relied on bassist Butler for lyrics. The song was inspired by the frustrations Osbourne felt at the time, as Black Sabbath's former manager Patrick Meehan was suing the band after having been fired. The song viciously attacks the music business in general and is a savage diatribe directed towards Meehan specifically (\"Are you Satan? Are you man?\"), with Osbourne revealing in his memoir, \"I wrote most of the lyrics myself, which felt a bit like seeing a shrink. All the anger I felt towards Meehan came pouring out.\"  During this period, the band began to question if there was any point to recording albums and touring endlessly \"just to pay the lawyers\". Thematically, \"The Writ\" and \"Megalomania\" are intertwined, according to drummer Ward, as they both deal with the same tensions arising from these ongoing legal troubles."]}, {"page": "Vol. 4 (Black Sabbath album)", "response": ["Vol. 4 is the fourth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released in September 1972.
