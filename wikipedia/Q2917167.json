Analysts such as Helen Graham have linked the Red and White Terrors, alleging that it was the failed coup that allowed the culture of brutal violence to flourish: \"its original act of violence was that it killed off the possibility of other forms of peaceful political evolution\".Unearthing Franco's Legacy, University of Notre Dame Press,  p. 7 Other historians have found evidence of systematic persecution and violence predating the military uprising and have found what they term a \"radical and antidemocratic\" anti-clericalism among supporters of the Second Spanish Republic and even within its constitution.Redzioch, Wlodzimierz (interviewing historian Vicente Carcel Orti) The Martyrs of Spain's Civil War, Catholic Culture In recent years, the Catholic Church has beatified hundreds of the victims (498 in one 2007 ceremony, the largest single number of beatifications in its history).", "By contrast, historians such as Helen Graham,Graham, Helen.

That is concurred by Francisco Partaloa, prosecutor of the Madrid High Court of Justice (Tribunal Supremo de Madrid) and Queipo de Llano's friend, who observed repression in both zones. I had the opportunity of being a witness to the repression in both areas. In the Nationalist side it was planned, methodical, cold. As they did not trust the people the authorities imposed their will by means of terror, committing atrocities in order to achieve their aim. Atrocities also took place in the Popular Front zone; that was something which both areas had in common. But the main difference was that in the Republican zone the crimes were carried out by the populace in moments of passion, not by the authorities. The latter always tried to stop them. The assistance that I received from the Spanish Republican authorities in order to flee to safety, is only one of the many examples.

To some extent sustained by adoption of Ley de la Memoria Historica in 2007, Enrique Moradiellos, Revisi\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica cr\u00edtica y pseudo-revisionismo pol\u00edtico presntista: el caso de la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola, Badajoz 2011, p. 13. The law triggered another historiographic protest manifesto, titled Manifiesto por la Verdad Hist\u00f3rica and signed among others by Federico Jim\u00e9nez, C\u00e9sar Vidal, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Marco, Pedro Schwartz, Ricardo de la Cierva and Jes\u00fas Palacios, Montesinos 2007, p. 55 the discussion transformed when a group of professional historians challenged the anti-revisionists; from that moment onwards the conflict was no longer between amateurs\"aparte de Stanley Payne, no les respald\u00f3 ning\u00fan historiador profesional importante\", Malefakis 2011 and scholars, but between the scholars themselves. It reached another milestone in 2010-2011, the years when Manuel \u00c1lvarez Tard\u00edo and Roberto Villa Garc\u00eda published a general work on the Second Republic and when RAH-edited Diccionario Biogr\u00e1fico Espa\u00f1ol published a biography of Francisco Franco. some scholars claim that publication of the biogram exposed \"the limits of post-Francoist democratization\", Chris Ealham, The Emperor's New Clothes: 'Objectivity' and Revisionism in Spanish History, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 48/1 (2012), p. 192 The latter caused heated controversy mostly in popular discourse; according to many, the biography was revisionist and scandalous. The former had a low-profile but more lasting effect, and became a negative point of reference for many works confronting revisionist historiography.especially the 2012 volume En el combate por la historia, edited by Angel Vi\u00f1as, see Ealham 2012, pp. 193-194, Peter Anderson, Knowing and Acknowledging Spain\u2019s Dark Civil War Past, [in:] Journal of Contemporary History 52/1 (2017), p. 135 The discussion on revisionism kept escalating and assumed increasingly militant tone. The next milestone was reached when in 2014 Stanley G. Payne published his biography of Franco (co-authored by Jes\u00fas Palacios Tapias); at that point some concluded that revisionism was embraced by the world's most distinguished Hispanists.even junior students with no previous scientific contribution do not hesitate to assert that since the late 1990s Payne's \"credibility started to decline\", that he turned into \"almost an apologist of the Franco regime\", that his stature \"has plummeted from a respectful and significant historian to an almost apologist\", and that due to his \"propaganda-like work\" Payne \"has no objectivity\"; the MA hopeful then proceeds to lecture Payne and other scholars how a properly written historiographic work should look like, Ascenett Martinez-Lopez, The Spanish Predisposition. Biases within the Historiography and Memory of the Spanish Civil War [MA thesis University of Newcastle], Newcastle 2017, pp. 8 and passim. The thesis was supervised by one of the anti-revisionists, Alejandro Quiroga Since then the debate has reached an unprecedented level and spilled over to global historiography.the debate on revisionism was taken up mostly by British and American scholars, compare contributions of Peter Anderson, Sebastian Balfour, Gerard Blaney Jr., Cathie Carmichael, Chris Ealham, Helen Graham, Stanley G. Payne, Samuel Pierce, Paul Preston, Tim Rees, Michael Richards, Richard A. Robinson, Michael Seidman, Robert Stradling, Nigel Townson and Mary Vincent, see e.g. sections in Journal of Contemporary History or European History Quarterly in issues from 2006 to 2017.

The authors claim that new regulations are \"moral duty\" towards victims of the war and Francoism. The opponents claim that the proposal advances \"soviet-style regulations\".
