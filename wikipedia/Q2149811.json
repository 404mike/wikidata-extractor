The scientific research center MASCA (Museum Applied Science Center for Archaeology) was also closed, although the MASCA scientists moved to other Sections within the museum. The decision elicited local and world-wide criticism among concerned scholars, who felt that it departed from the Penn Museum's historic mission as a research institution. Museum administrators attributed this measure to the 2008 financial crisis and the deep budget cuts that had resulted at the University of Pennsylvania.  The museum's director at the time, Dr. Richard Hodges later offered positions as \"Associate Curators\" or \"Research Project Managers\" to eleven of the eighteen individuals affected.

The Department at Sheffield then expanded further by introducing elements of Industrial Archaeology taught by David Crossley from the Sheffield Department of Economic and Social History, and appointing Richard Hodges to teach Medieval Archaeology. The appointment of Robin Torrence to teach anthropology, theory, and statistics (who had studied under Lewis Binford and Colin Refrew) in line with the department's expansion marked an increasing diversification and seminal interdisciplinary perspective on archaeological research.", "The threat of closure has received criticism. A statement from the Council for British Archaeology described the proposed closure as \"devastating\" and went on to say \"at a time when commercial archaeology is desperate for new employees the loss of a department with Sheffield's reputation and track record is a short-sighted and retrograde step\". Former department academic, Mike Parker Pearson stated: \"Sheffield is one of the UK's leading departments of archaeology, known and respected throughout the world. I suspect the vice-chancellor has no idea of the international outrage that closing the department is going to cause.\" A letter to The Times beginning \"We are dismayed at the news that the University of Sheffield's renowned Department of Archaeology is under threat of closure\" was signed by leading British archaeologists, including Amy Bogaard, Graeme Barker, Chris Gosden, Melanie Giles, Richard Hodges, and Colin Renfrew. An anonymous donor offered the university \u00a3200,000 if the department was kept open. The University Senate met on 23 June; a final decision was made on 12 July to close the department. By this point a petition to keep the department has gained more than 42,000 signatures.
