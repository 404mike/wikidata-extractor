He is credited with the creation of Base ten blocks, popularly referred to as Dienes blocks.\nDienes's life and ideas are described in his autobiography, Memoirs of a Maverick Mathematician (ISBN 1844261921), and his book of mathematical games, I Will Tell You Algebra Stories You've Never Heard Before (ISBN 1844261913). He has also published a book of poetry, Calls from the Past (ISBN 1844261905).\nHis later life contributions have been chronicled by Bharath Sriraman in the second monograph of The Mathematics Enthusiast.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denesh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1l Dienes"]}, {"page": "Zoltan Paul Dienes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1l Dienes"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Education in Hungary", "response": ["Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1l DienesStub"]}, {"page": "Zoltan Pal Dienes", "response": ["#redirect Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1l Dienes"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Science and technology in Hungary", "response": ["Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1l DienesStub"]}, {"page": "Dienes (surname)", "response": ["* Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1l Dienes, Hungarian mathematician"]}, {"page": "Base ten block", "response": ["Base ten blocks, also known as multibase arithmetic blocks (MAB) or Dienes blocks (after their creator, mathematician and educationalist Zolt\u00e1n P\u00e1l Dienes), are a mathematical manipulative used by students to learn basic mathematical concepts including addition, subtraction, number sense, place value and counting. The student can manipulate the blocks in different ways to express numbers and patterns. Generally, the three-dimensional blocks are made of a solid material such as plastic or wood and come in four sizes to indicate their individual place value: Units (ones place), Longs (tens place), Flats (hundreds place) and Blocks (thousands place).Van de Walle, John (2008).
