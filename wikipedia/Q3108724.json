He is credited with the creation of Base ten blocks, popularly referred to as Dienes blocks.\nDienes's life and ideas are described in his autobiography, Memoirs of a Maverick Mathematician (ISBN 1844261921), and his book of mathematical games, I Will Tell You Algebra Stories You've Never Heard Before (ISBN 1844261913). He has also published a book of poetry, Calls from the Past (ISBN 1844261905).\nHis later life contributions have been chronicled by Bharath Sriraman in the second monograph of The Mathematics Enthusiast.", "link_mentions": {}}}
