Each had the responsibility of cooking a dish of a six-course meal for 50 diners and the judges. Clare assigned a pair of ingredients for each contestant, which they had to highlight in their dish. By knife pull, Tamara (with marron and ras el hanout) and Eliza (mushrooms and spruce) were assigned to cook entr\u00e9es, Diana (who had venison and pear) and Karlie (duck and Tasmanian mountain pepper) cooked the mains & Sarah (assigned with sheep's milk yoghurt and bergamot leaf) and Ben (pineapple and coriander seeds) were tasked with making the desserts. The best performers of the challenge joined Arum in the Finals. The time pressure was great for the contestants as they struggled to prep their dishes. Ben's performance in the kitchen resulted in him delivering the dish of the day and he advanced to the Finals. Tamara failed to highlight her second ingredient: ras el hanout while her couscous was undercooked which derailed the overall grade of her dish, Karlie's duck was cooked inconsistently and Sarah's savoury dessert was imbalanced with the use of roasted fennel. They were named the Bottom 3 as a result, but Eliza, who overpowered the spruce flavour in her dish with her Parmesan custard, had never been in any previous Elimination Challenges (including Pressure Tests) and therefore, she would face her first if Sarah decided to use her immunity pin."]}, {"page": "List of female chefs with Michelin stars", "response": ["Following the Second World War, Marguerite Bise became the third woman to win three Michelin stars, at her restaurant Auberge du P\u00e8re Bise in 1950.
