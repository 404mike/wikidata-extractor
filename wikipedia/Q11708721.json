His record shows him to have been a notable team player in squadron tactics.Wallace originally served with 9 Squadron RNAS in 1917 as a Sopwith Camel pilot. He won his first dogfights there, sharing victories on 6 and 16 September 1917 with Joseph Stewart Temple Fall and several other pilots. He then transferred to 1 Squadron RNAS in early 1918. On 11 March 1918, he scored a solo victory, driving an Albatros D.V down out of control. Five days later, he shared a win with Maxwell Findlay. Wallace would not score again until 2 May, when he, Reginald Brading, Samuel Kinkead, and several other British pilots sent a hapless German observation plane down out of control; Wallace thus became an ace.His next triumph on the morning of 15 May was more of the same, as Wallace, Findlay, Kinkead, Brading, Charles Dawson Booker, Robert McLaughlin, and three other British pilots pounced upon and destroyed an Albatros D.V. A solo \"out of control\" win on the afternoon patrol for the 15th, and another the next day put Wallace's tally at eight.He then transferred to 3 Squadron as the commander of C Flight. On 20 July 1918, he and Adrian Franklyn drove a Hannover two-seater observation plane down out of control. He continued to score with his new unit\u2013mostly solo victories, but with one win shared with George R. Riley\u2013bringing his total to thirteen by 21 August. The next day, he became a balloon buster, teaming with Riley to bring down a German observation balloon. Though he scored no further victories, his Distinguished Flying Cross was awarded on 2 November 1918.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "No. 201 Squadron RAF", "response": ["Hazel Wallace.The Aerodrome Retrieved 4 March 2010."]}, {"page": "List of World War I aces credited with 11\u201314 victories", "response": ["| Hazel Wallace"]}, {"page": "Hazel LeRoy Wallace", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hazel Wallace"]}, {"page": "Adrian Franklyn", "response": ["On 20 July Franklyn and Captain Hazel Wallace drove down a Hannover C over Ayette, making Franklyn an ace.

Riley", "response": ["He would not score again until 8 August. In this second string of victories, he shared two credits with Hazel Wallace and one with William Maxted. It was with the latter that he scored his fifth balloon victory, and twelfth win overall, by the unusual measure of bombing it into flames while it was on the ground. The day following that, on 28 September 1918, he scored his last victory. In total, he had destroyed five balloons, two of which were shared with other pilots, as well as destroying two enemy aircraft. He also drove down five enemy aircraft out of control, and captured one."]}, {"page": "Reginald Brading", "response": ["Brading joined the Royal Naval Air Service on 12 June 1917, just a month past his eighteenth birthday. He trained in an operational squadron, 12 Naval, before being posted to 1 Naval in April 1918 as a Sopwith Camel pilot. On 2 May, he scored his first aerial victory when a squadron patrol caught a luckless German reconnaissance plane north of Albert and Brading, Samuel Kinkead, Hazel Wallace, and four other pilots sent it down out of control for a win apiece. On the 15th, Brading gained a second victory in similar fashion, teaming with Kinkead, Wallace, Charles Dawson Booker, Robert McLaughlin, Maxwell Findlay, James Henry Forman, and two other pilots to destroy an Albatros D.V to add to all their scores. Brading also received a second victory that day, for his solo win in driving a second Albatros D.V down out of control. His fourth triumph came on 9 June, when he drove a DFW reconnaissance plane down out of control. On 28 June, he became an ace by driving down another Albatros D.V. From there on, Brading's wins were always over the best German fighter planes, Fokker D.VIIs and a Pfalz D.XII. The only curiosity among them was the last pilot downed plummeted to his death in one of the pioneering uses of a parachute; that was on 16 September 1918."]}, {"page": "Harold Stackard", "response": ["Stackard's remaining twelve victories were all from Sopwith Camel aircraft, single-seat biplanes. His next two kills were both from Sopwith Camel (B6204). On 3 September 1917, he destroyed an Albatros D.III southeast of Pervijze, West Flanders. It was shared with Flight Commander Joseph Fall, Flight Sub-Lieutenant J E Scott, and Flight Sub-Lieutenant Arthur Wood. The following day, Stackard destroyed a DFW C over the Nieuwpoort-Middelkerke area. He shared that fifth victory with Joseph Fall and J. E. Scott. Pilot Stackard had his sixth triumph on 6 September 1917, when he drove an Albatros C out of control over Middelkerke. It was shared with Arthur Wood, Flight Sub-Lieutenant Hazel Wallace, J. E. Scott, and Joseph Fall. Stackard racked up his seventh victory on 9 September 1917 while piloting his Sopwith Camel (B6204). He sent an Albatros D.V out of control east of Middelkerke, aided by Joseph Fall."]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Hazel Wallace"]}]}}
