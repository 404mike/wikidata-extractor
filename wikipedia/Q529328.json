With the tournament being staged in Australia and organised by Eddie Charlton, Spencer found himself in a half of the draw which featured both Ray Reardon and Alex Higgins, meaning that all the champions since 1969 were in the same half of the draw. Still worse, the organisational seedings placed Spencer at 8, meaning that he met Reardon in the quarter-final. Despite opening up with two centuries in the first four frames and leading 17\u201316, with the scars of their epic 1973 semi-final still fresh, the match slipped away from Spencer 17\u201319.

Spencer could not resist giving the excited spectators a shock by lunging forward and hitting over the cue ball in his initial address, before potting the final black. Thames Television were resting their TV crew at the time following the previous match between Alex Higgins and David Taylor and so missed the historic moment. This did not count as an official maximum break as the event used non-templated tables, so it remains an unofficial maximum break.
