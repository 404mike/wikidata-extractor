A fast or fast-medium bowler renowned for his accurate bowling and particular hostility on uncovered wickets, he played county cricket for Derbyshire from 1947 to 1963, and was regularly at, or near the top of, the English bowling averages. He played in only two Test matches for England, one in 1949 and a second in 1961. Jackson's absence from Test cricket was largely because his batting was so underdeveloped: his highest first-class score was 39 not out, and he reached 30 on only two other occasions. Between July 1949 and August 1950, Jackson indeed played fifty-one innings without reaching double figures, a number known to be exceeded only by Jem Shaw, Nobby Clark, Eric Hollies (twice), Brian Boshier and Mark Robinson. His leading competitors like Trueman, Tyson, and even teammate Gladwin were far better batsmen.\nCricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, \"it is one of cricket\u2019s great crimes that Les Jackson, a most respected fast bowler on the circuit throughout the 1950s, played only twice for England.  It is said that his slingy, hostile action and his blunt opinions did not please the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) but in an era when Alec Bedser carried England\u2018s attack on his own, Jackson\u2019s omission was a scandalous loss\". Bateman added that Jackson, \"...was as feared as Truemen and Tyson in county cricket\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
