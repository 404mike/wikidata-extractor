A fast or fast-medium bowler renowned for his accurate bowling and particular hostility on uncovered wickets, he played county cricket for Derbyshire from 1947 to 1963, and was regularly at, or near the top of, the English bowling averages. He played in only two Test matches for England, one in 1949 and a second in 1961. Jackson's absence from Test cricket was largely because his batting was so underdeveloped: his highest first-class score was 39 not out, and he reached 30 on only two other occasions. Between July 1949 and August 1950, Jackson indeed played fifty-one innings without reaching double figures, a number known to be exceeded only by Jem Shaw, Nobby Clark, Eric Hollies (twice), Brian Boshier and Mark Robinson. His leading competitors like Trueman, Tyson, and even teammate Gladwin were far better batsmen.\nCricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, \"it is one of cricket\u2019s great crimes that Les Jackson, a most respected fast bowler on the circuit throughout the 1950s, played only twice for England.  It is said that his slingy, hostile action and his blunt opinions did not please the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) but in an era when Alec Bedser carried England\u2018s attack on his own, Jackson\u2019s omission was a scandalous loss\". Bateman added that Jackson, \"...was as feared as Truemen and Tyson in county cricket\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Laker", "response": ["In 1949, Laker played in only one of the four Tests against New Zealand even though he took 122 wickets in the season.

The match was drawn and Laker, bowling well, took 4/78 in New Zealand's second innings.

Again the Philadelphians won and again Hordern and King took most of the wickets. This trend continued throughout the tour. In the first-class matches that King played, the Philadelphians recorded four wins and six losses. Although he was already 35 years old, King had posted extraordinary numbers in his bowling.

Among Allen's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship, good fielding, and for the team to bowl overs more quickly.Swanton, pp. 256\u201357. While looking for new batting talent, Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen; several emerged in this period, including Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey, who had successful careers and were part of a strong English batting line-up.Marshall, pp. 185\u201386. At least one member of the England team, Jim Laker, resented the preference of amateurs, whom he believed were paid more for playing than the professionals.Marshall, 253\u201354. Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to keep them in their place; critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of Les Jackson for reasons of class. Allen also played the role of disciplinarian. Several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life; it was often left to Allen to issue warnings when they transgressed.Marshall, pp. 193\u201396. He played an active role in home Test matches, generally attending at least three of the five days of every game, discussing tactics with the captain,Marshall, p. 201. and speaking to the press. In his first season, Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain; Len Hutton, the serving captain, retired from the team with injury. In his place, the selectors appointed May, who served until 1959 and again in 1961; he and Allen established a good working relationship.Swanton, pp. 257\u201358.

In the 1956 season he played four matches and took his first five wicket innings against Yorkshire. He played three matches in the 1957 season. He developed to become a fast seam bowler.

Ridgway's most notable performance was on the featherbed Trent Bridge wicket, where he took six for 79 in the first innings, and paved the way for an easy Kent victory. Apart from teammate Doug Wright in the second innings, no visiting bowler at Trent Bridge bettered those figures all year, but Ridgway's most notable feat that year was his striking consistency: with only one haul of eight or more in a match he still took 90 wickets in 20 county games.
