He sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain and then in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1800 to 1813.\nJohnstone was born in Pensacola, Florida.  He was one of four illegitimate sons of George Johnstone, then a captain in the Royal Navy, later an admiral. His mother was Martha Ford.He was elected at a by-election in 1800 as Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Aldeburgh.\nThe following year, he bought an estate in Wales and began canvassing the borough of Hedon in Yorkshire, and topped the poll at the 1802 general election.\nHe was re-elected 3 times, facing a contest only in 1807,\nand held the seat until his death in 1813.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Johnstone (surname)", "response": ["* George Johnstone, 3rd Marquess of Annandale (1720\u20131792)", "* George Johnstone (1730\u20131787), British naval officer and Member of Parliament", "* George Johnstone (1764\u20131813), British politician", "* George Johnstone Stoney (1826\u20131911), Irish physicist; introduced the term \"electron\""]}, {"page": "Cannizaro Park", "response": ["After the Dundas family moved out, George Johnstone and his sister Sophia moved in.

In a multifaceted career he was also a member of parliament, a director of the East India Company, a member of the Carlisle Peace Commission and the first Governor of West Florida from 1763 until 1767.", "George Johnstone was born in 1730 in Dumfriesshire the fourth son of Sir James Johnstone, 3rd Baronet of Westerhall, Dumfries, and his wife Barbara Murray, the oldest sister of the literary patron Patrick Murray, 5th Lord Elibank. He was a younger brother of William Johnstone (later Sir William Pulteney),", "He returned to Great Britain in 1767, where he once more became involved in the politics of the East India Company. He had previously been one of a number of his family to support Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive in 1764, but by 1767 Clive was persecuting George's brother John Johnstone, who was at this time a member of the company's council in Bengal. George Johnstone spoke out and voted against Clive, gaining a reputation as an orator. He sought election to Parliament on the back of this reputation, and after securing the patronage of Sir James Lowther was elected to represent Cockermouth in 1768. He became part of the parliamentary group supporting Lowther's interests, and retained his membership after his election to the constituency of Appleby in 1774. He continued to be active in the politics of the East India Company, using his parliamentary position to make speeches attacking the North Ministry's schemes for Indian reform, and laying the blame for the chaos in Bengal at Clive's door. He found favour for doing so with the company's court of proprietors, who made him chair of a proprietary committee aiming to block plans for company reform. Despite these efforts, the Prime Minister, Lord North, was able to pass an act regulating the East India Company in 1773.", "George Johnstone died at Hotwells, Bristol, possibly from Hodgkin's disease, on 24 May 1787. He was survived by his wife Charlotte, by whom he had one son, John Lowther Johnstone.  He also had four illegitimate children, including George Johnstone (1764\u20131813), who became an MP.", "John later succeeded his uncle, Sir William Pulteney Johnstone, as 6th Baronet of Westerhall. George Johnstone had achieved small-scale success as a naval officer, serving with undoubted courage, but had not been able to succeed when given a major command. His poor strategic planning had led to his force being badly surprised at Porto Praya, and despite having rallied and successfully beaten off the French, his assumption that Suffren would not head immediately to the Cape proved his undoing and handed the French an important strategic victory. He achieved some successes as the founder of the colony of West Florida, despite ultimately failing to win the support of his political masters and the wider civil society, and would later rate his time in Florida more highly than his comparatively greater success as a director of the East India Company. He was a renowned orator when speaking in opposition, but was never asked to join an administration and several of the high-profile causes he supported ultimately failed."]}, {"page": "Hedon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|George JohnstoneJohnstone was re-elected at the general election of 1812, but shortly afterwards began to suffer from epileptic seizures, and never retook his seat||rowspan=\"2\"|"]}, {"page": "Aldeburgh (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| George Johnstone"]}, {"page": "George Johnstone", "response": ["George Johnstone may refer to:", "*George Johnstone (footballer, born 1914) (1914\u20131974), Scottish football goalkeeper, played for Aberdeen, Dunfermline, Raith and Morton", "*George Johnstone (Australian footballer) (1869\u20131956), Australian rules footballer", "*George Johnstone (Royal Navy officer) (1730\u20131787), British naval officer and member of Parliament", "*George Johnstone (congressman) (1846\u20131921), U.S. Representative from South Carolina", "*George Johnstone (British Army officer), Major General commander 6th Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, Peninsula war", "*George Johnstone (magician), worked with Harry Blackstone, Sr. and had his own notable career as a magician", "*George Johnstone (1764\u20131813), English politician, MP for Aldeburgh 1800\u201302 and for Hedon 1802\u201313"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1806\u20131818)", "response": ["|4 December 1813||Hedon||u||George Johnstone||John Broadhurst||Death", "|14 April 1815||East Grinstead||u||James Stephen||Sir George Johnstone Hope||Resignation", "|13 May 1818||East Grinstead||u*||Sir George Johnstone Hope||Lord Strathavon||Death"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain by-elections (1790\u20131800)", "response": ["|26 March 1800||Aldeburgh||u||Michael Angelo Taylor||George Johnstone||Resignation to contest City Durham"]}, {"page": "George Johnstone (1764-1813)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Johnstone (1764\u20131813)"]}, {"page": "George Johnstone (died 1813)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Johnstone (1764\u20131813)"]}, {"page": "George Johnstone (d. 1813)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Johnstone (1764\u20131813)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1796 British general election", "response": ["|Foxite Whig.
