The morbid activity of his memory, however, continued to make him many enemies. He alienated Disraeli by tracing a purple patch in his official eulogy of the Duke of Wellington to a newspaper translation from Thiers's funeral panegyric on General St Cyr. His sharp tongue had already made him an enemy of Roebuck, and he disgusted the friends of Mill by the stories he raked up for an obituary notice of the great economist (The Times, 10 May 1873). He broke with Henry Reeve in 1874 by a venomous review of the Greville Memoirs, in which Reeve was compared to the beggarly Scot deputed to let off the blunderbuss which Bolingbroke (Greville) had charged."]}, {"page": "Charles Greville (diarist)", "response": ["Greville died at Mayfair, London, and the celebrity now attached to his name is entirely due to the posthumous publication of a portion of a Journal or Diary that it was his practice to keep during the greater part of his life. These papers were given by him to his friend Henry Reeve a short time before his death, with an injunction that they should be published, as far as was feasible, at not too remote a period after the writer's death."]}, {"page": "Lucie, Lady Duff-Gordon", "response": ["Her parents only child, her chief playfellows were her first cousin Henry Reeve, and the  teen-age John Stuart Mill. Inheriting her parents\u2019 talents Lucie developed a strong love of reading and as she grew in vigour and in sense, she developed a strong tinge of originality and independence, with a marked love of animals. Her childhood also included having the elderly Jeremy Bentham (who had founded Utilitarianism) take her around his garden in an activity they called \"ante-prandial circumgyration\".

Soon after arrival in Geneva, at the beginning of November 1829, Krasi\u0144ski met Henry Reeve, a physician's son who was in Switzerland to study philosophy and literature.

From 1829 he was alternate morning preacher, and from 1836 to 1857 perpetual curate, of St. James, Hampstead Road, London. He officiated during the same period at the large cemetery of St. James, Piccadilly, which was situated behind his church, and from 1834 to December 1879 he acted as chaplain to University College hospital.

As a landlord he was keenly interested in land tenure in Ireland, and the Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870 incorporated many of his ideas. He was appointed a county court judge for County Louth in 1872 and after six years was transferred to County Kerry. At his own request he was transferred in 1886 to the county judgeship of the united counties of Sligo and Roscommon and thereafter devoted most of his efforts to literary work."]}]}}
