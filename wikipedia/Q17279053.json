Bewick had to hand the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman's account of his visit to the Cape of Good Hope on Cook's expedition of 1772 to 1776, and animals from the Southern Cape figure largely in the book. It was an energetic muddle, but it was at once greeted with enthusiasm by the British public. They liked the combination of vigorous woodcuts, simple and accurate descriptions, and all kinds of exotic animals alongside things they knew."]}, {"page": "Robert Bakewell (agriculturalist)", "response": ["* George Culley & Robert Heaton 1804, Observations on live stock: containing hints for choosing and improving the best breeds of the most useful kinds of domestic animals", "* Anne Orde (ed.), Matthew Culley, George Culley: Travel Journals and Letters, 1765-1798 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 10"]}, {"page": "Fowberry Tower", "response": ["The Blakes sold the estate in 1807 to Matthew Culley (born 1778), son of the noted expert agriculturalist George Culley (born 1735).Matthew and George Culley.

In 1800, at the age of twenty-five. Bates took a twenty-one years' lease of two large farms at Halton Castle, at a high rent, and with a view to stocking them 'purchased his first shorthorn cows from Charles Colling, giving him for one of them the first one hundred guineas the Collings ever sold a cow for'.", "He speedily achieved renown as a breeder of taste and judgment, and at Charles Colling's famous Ketton sale in 1810 he bought for 185 guineas a cow called Duchess, which was the foundress of a well-known tribe of shorthorns. He exhibited his cattle at the local shows from 1804 to 1812. Wishing to follow out the principles of George Culley in regard to experiments and trials, he embodied his views in 1807 in an elaborate letter, which he styled An Address to the Board of Agriculture and to the other Agricultural Societies of the Kingdom on the importance of an Institution for ascertaining the merits of different breeds of live stock, pointing out the advantages that will accrue therefrom to the landed interest and the kingdom in general. In 1809-10-11 he spent his winters at the university of Edinburgh to study chemistry, and took, after his fashion, copious notes of the lectures on various subjects he attended. In 1811 he was sufficiently well off to buy a moiety of the manor of Kirklevington, near Yarm, in Cleveland, for \u00a330,000, \u00a320,000 of which he paid in cash. About ten years later, when his lease of Halton ran out, he bought Ridley Hall on the South Tyne, and resided there till 1831. He then removed to Kirklevington, where he lived for the remainder of his life."]}, {"page": "General View of Agriculture county surveys", "response": ["|John Bailey, George Culley", "|John Bailey, George Culley"]}, {"page": "Culley, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Culley"]}]}}
