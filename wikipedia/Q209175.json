The play concerned a local Russian schoolteacher who struggles to remain faithful to his wife, despite the attentions of three other women. McKellen received mixed reviews from critics in particular Frank Rich of The New York Times who praised him for his \"bravura and athletically graceful technique that provides everything except, perhaps, the thing that matters most - sustained laughter.\" He later wrote, \"Mr. McKellen finds himself in the peculiar predicament of the star who strains to carry a frail supporting cast.\" In 1989 he played Iago in production of Othello by the Royal Shakespeare Company."]}, {"page": "Liverpool", "response": ["Notable actors and actresses from Liverpool include Arthur Askey, Tom Baker, Kim Cattrall, Jodie Comer, Stephen Graham, Rex Harrison, Jason Isaacs, Tina Malone, the McGann brothers (Joe, Mark, Paul, and Stephen), David Morrissey, Elizabeth Morton, Peter Serafinowicz, Elisabeth Sladen, Alison Steadman, and Rita Tushingham.

By the time that Blalock auditioned in the final group, the crew had seen hundreds of actresses, according to Berman. His main issue at the time was to find a \"beautiful woman who can act and doesn't want to go right into feature films\". Blalock was excited about the casting as she had been a lifelong Star Trek fan, with her favourite character being Spock. Bakula's casting as Archer was announced via press release on May 10, 2001. However, some of the British media mistook the announcement for Bakula taking over from Patrick Stewart.

Initially, the character of Saavik, who appeared in the second through fourth Star Trek films, was intended to be the traitor, but Gene Roddenberry objected to making a character loved by fans into a villain. Cattrall was unwilling to be the third actress to play Saavik (a part she had originally auditioned for), but accepted the role when it became a different character. Cattrall chose the Eris element of the character's name, for the Greek goddess of strife, which was Vulcanized by the addition of the \"Val\" at the behest of director Nicholas Meyer.
