These five members featured in the most commercially successful line-up.", "After a couple of minor singles, the band's first major hit was \"Girls on Film\" (1981), from their self-titled debut album, the popularity of which was enhanced by a controversial music video, which in heavily edited form, played in rotation on MTV.  The band's breakthrough album was Rio (1982), their second album, which peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 album chart in the US, number two in the United Kingdom, and number one in Australia and Canada.  The songs \"Rio\" and \"Hungry Like the Wolf\", which featured cinematic music videos, became two of their biggest hits, with the latter winning the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 1984.  Their follow-up third album Seven and the Ragged Tiger became their only UK number one album; it also reached top ten status in the US, Canada, Australia, and several other countries, and featured the US and UK number one single \"The Reflex\".  In 1985, the band topped the US charts with the single \"A View to a Kill\" from the soundtrack of the film of the same name.  Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor both left before the recording of the band's fourth album, 1986's Notorious, which was produced by Nile Rogers and featured the top ten single, also named \"Notorious\".  The band spent the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s continuing to release albums and singles, to only moderate success.  Their comeback album, 1993's Duran Duran (commonly called The Wedding Album) returned the band to their former superstar status, featuring two top-ten worldwide hits \"Ordinary World\" and \"Come Undone\".  A 1995 album of cover songs, Thank You, produced a minor hit in the critically acclaimed cover of Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day\", but was otherwise critically panned.  After John Taylor left in 1997, the band released a number of albums and singles which (compared to prior releases) underperformed on the sales charts.  A full reunion of the original lineup of LeBon, Rhodes, and all three Taylors in 2001 led to a number of highly successful concert tours and the 2004 album Astronaut, which reached number 3 in the UK and top 40 in numerous other countries.  The album's lead single \"(Reach Up for The) Sunrise\" was an international dance hit, and reached number five in the UK.  Andy Taylor left again in 2006, and the band has released four additional albums, with the most recent being Future Past in October, 2021.", "The band's first singer was Stephen Duffy. Simon Colley soon joined Taylor, Rhodes and Duffy. Colley was the band's original bass player, as John Taylor was the guitarist at this point. This was the first complete line-up of the band that played live shows. For percussion, an electronic drum machine belonging to Rhodes was used. After Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979, a few guitarists were auditioned, mostly unsuccessfully, as well as a handful of vocalists. Andy Wickett, brought on in 1979 as lead vocalist, had a major part in the writing of \"Girls on Film\" during his tenure with the band, according to Andy Taylor's autobiography. Wickett is featured on the demos that were presented to EMI in 1980. According to both Wickett's and John Taylor's websites, Wickett co-wrote an early version of the song that came to be known as \"Rio\". Upon Colley's and Wickett's departures, the band enlisted singer Jeff Thomas and guitarist Alan Curtis, each for only a relatively brief period.", "The meeting of drummer Roger Taylor in 1979 with John Taylor, Rhodes and Wickett at a party, as well as the departure of Colley, led John Taylor to switch to bass. Roger Taylor then became their original (human) drummer. It was this line-up (John Taylor on bass and guitar along with Rhodes, Wickett and Roger Taylor) that made the first-ever Duran Duran studio demo tapes. In April 1980, guitarist Andy Taylor came from Newcastle upon Tyne to audition after responding to an advertisement in Melody Maker. In May 1980, London vocalist Simon Le Bon was recommended to the band by an ex-girlfriend who worked at the Rum Runner. The owners of the club, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow, became the band's management, paying them to work as doormen, disc jockeys and barmen when they were not rehearsing.", "The band began 1983 by playing the MTV New Year's Eve Rock 'n' Roll Ball with \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" still climbing the charts in the US, and the American reissue of the \"Rio\" single to follow in March. To satisfy America's appetite for their music, the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US in the middle of the year with the addition of the new single \"Is There Something I Should Know?\". Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number 1 in the UK (a rarity then and their first chart-topper in their home country) and reached number 4 on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest VJs for a show, during which artist and admirer Andy Warhol dropped by to greet them. \"Our first gigs in the United States were crazy and culty\", Rhodes said later, \"But when we came back after 'Hungry' was a hit, it was mayhem. It was Beatlemania. We were doing a signing of the 'Girls on Film' video at a store in Times Square. We couldn't get out of the store. The cops sealed off the streets.\" Also in 1983, keyboardist Nick Rhodes produced the UK number 1 and US number 5 hit \"Too Shy\" for the English band Kajagoogoo and Andy Taylor became the first member of Duran Duran to get married.", "Even with Duran Duran on hold, band members were soon anxious to record new music, leading to a supposedly temporary split into two side projects. John Taylor and Andy Taylor wanted to break away from the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson to form the rock/funk supergroup the Power Station, which released two Top 10 singles. Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes wanted to further explore Duran Duran's atmospheric aspect and formed Arcadia, who released one LP (So Red the Rose) from which the single \"Election Day\" was released. Contributors to that album included guitarist Masami Tsuchiya, bassist Mark Egan, percussionist David Van Tieghem, drummer Steve Jordan, Sting, Herbie Hancock, and David Gilmour. Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well as contributing percussion to the Power Station album. Duran Duran were never the same after this break. According to Rhodes, the two side projects \"were commercial suicide... But we've always been good at that.\" The band was still off balance when they regrouped to contribute \"A View to a Kill\" to the 1985 James Bond movie of the same name. This single was the first Bond theme to go to number 1 on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number 2. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years.", "Guitarist Andy Taylor led the remaining members to believe he would return to work on a new Duran Duran album, even as he was signing a solo recording contract in Los Angeles with MCA, eventually releasing a solo album in 1986 called Thunder. The band resorted to legal measures to get him into the studio but after numerous delays they let him go at last. He played on only a few songs on the next album, including A Matter of Feeling, whilst the disagreements were being settled.", "In 2000, Le Bon approached John Taylor with a proposal to reform Duran Duran's classic line-up. They agreed to part company with Cuccurullo after completing the Pop Trash tour. Cuccurullo then announced on his website that he was leaving Duran Duran to resume work with his 1980s band Missing Persons. This announcement was confirmed the next day by Duran Duran's website, followed a day later by the news that John, Roger, and Andy Taylor had rejoined.

Subsequently, January concert dates in Japan had to be postponed until the summer, after drummer Roger Taylor broke a bone in his right foot in December.", "The second single, \"What Happens Tomorrow\", was released on 31 January 2005 and entered the UK chart at number 11 (where it peaked). It slowly gained radio play in the US, supported by a nearly sold-out tour of North American arenas and stadiums, touted as the band's \"largest tour ever\". Later in 2005, \"What Happens Tomorrow\" was used in a promotional spot for the US digital cable network Fox Soccer Channel; Simon Le Bon and John Taylor had also appeared in a separate spot for the network.

By the end of the 1980s, however, the band had lost both Roger and Andy Taylor, who had quit shortly after their 1985 Live Aid performance. Subsequent studio albums released including Notorious and Big Thing were not well received either critically or commercially, selling in far fewer quantities than their predecessors. Whilst the 1989 Decade compilation managed to chart in the Top 10 around the world, it was seen as a temporary stop-gap and an opportunity for the band to decide what musical direction they wanted to explore in the 1990s."]}, {"page": "Notorious (Duran Duran album)", "response": ["The making of Notorious during 1986 was a difficult time for Duran Duran. The band had planned on taking a much-needed break after the success of their 1984 world tour, but all of the band members had ended up working on one of two side projects (Power Station and Arcadia).

In addition to now becoming a three-piece, the band also began to act as their own management, having dismissed brothers Paul and Michael Berrow who had shepherded them through their first five years. Arrangements for the then-forthcoming Strange Behaviour Tour which kicked off in March 1987, as well as the tensions with Andy Taylor, are recounted in the documentary Three To Get Ready.", "During this time, Andy Taylor began jamming with members of the American band Missing Persons who were in the midst of breaking up. Missing Persons guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, noting that Andy did not intend to return to Duran Duran, offered his services to them instead. They hired him as a session and tour guitarist; he would later become a full member of the band in 1989.", "==Andy Taylor's participation==", "According to some reports, the relationship between Andy Taylor and the rest of the band had deteriorated to the point where he had to be threatened with legal action in order to get him back into the studio, but that the resulting sessions were so unpleasant for all involved that the band finally released him from any obligations to record.", "* Andy Taylor \u2013 guitars"]}, {"page": "Is There Something I Should Know?", "response": ["*Andy Taylor \u2013 guitar, vocals", "Category:Songs written by Andy Taylor (guitarist)"]}]}}
