Collard was a member of the Anglo-Soviet Law Association, and represented the Communist Party of Great Britain as a lawyer. His affiliation with communism led to the intelligence services keeping a file on him.Following the \"Trial of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center\" in 1937 (the second of the Moscow Trials), Collard published a book through the Left Book Club entitled Soviet Justice and the Trial of Radek and Others which argued that the trials had been conducted fairly. Most historians now conclude that the Moscow Trials were show trials.He was married to Elizabeth Katherine Collard (1911\u201428 December 1978), a writer, journalist and political activist with a particular interest in Middle Eastern issues.", "link_mentions": {}}}
