Collard was a member of the Anglo-Soviet Law Association, and represented the Communist Party of Great Britain as a lawyer. His affiliation with communism led to the intelligence services keeping a file on him.Following the \"Trial of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center\" in 1937 (the second of the Moscow Trials), Collard published a book through the Left Book Club entitled Soviet Justice and the Trial of Radek and Others which argued that the trials had been conducted fairly. Most historians now conclude that the Moscow Trials were show trials.He was married to Elizabeth Katherine Collard (1911\u201428 December 1978), a writer, journalist and political activist with a particular interest in Middle Eastern issues.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Percy Glading", "response": ["Glading's Old Bailey trial took place only two months after his arrest; this, says Robinson, is testament to how \"clear-cut\" the case against him was. The evidence presented included \"a mass of incriminating documents and photographic material\". Glading pled guilty. His solicitors, instructed by the CPGB, were Denis Pritt, leading, and assisted by Dudley Collard. They\u2014at the CPGB's request\u2014advised him to change his plea to Not Guilty; this Glading did. But they presented little evidence in his favour and carried out only minimal cross-examination, and the defence was unable to question Gray's credibility due to her professional behaviour on the stand. The prosecution, on the other hand, consisted of some of the most well-known advocates of the day and was led by Donald Somervell. Pritt's defence of Whomack was more energetic, and he lambasted the Official Secrets Act for making it \"far too easy to be charged for misdemeanour merely by wandering too close to a dockyard\" or anywhere else such secret plans were kept.The trial judge, Sir Anthony Hawke, told the accused that Glading was \"endeavouring to do anything [he] could to help another country and injure this. This is [his] own country but I cannot quite believe that this had any effect on your mind\". The judge wondered whether, as perhaps evinced by Glading's prosperous existence, he might have profited financially from his work with Moscow and that he was motivated by money rather than ideology. Whatever his motive, the outcome was never in doubt. On 14 March 1938, Glading received a sentence of six years' imprisonment (hard labour). Williams was sentenced to four years, Whomack to three. Munday's charges were withdrawn by the prosecution. Duff argues it is possible that this was the result of his making a deal with MI5 to turn king's evidence and reveal the tradecraft of Glading's operation at the Royal Arsenal. Even the others, comments MI5's official historian, received \"light sentences by the later standards of espionage trials\". This may well have been quid pro quo for pleading guilty and avoiding the need for a full prosecution."]}]}}
