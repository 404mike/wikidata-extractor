Manager Rob Page signed a new two-year contract in May 2015. However he needed to avoid a poor start to the season as chairman Norman Smurthwaite warned he was prepared to make \"ruthless decisions\" if the club were struggling by September. The first signings of the season were powerful former loanee defender Remie Streete from Newcastle United, and former Norwich City youth player Sam Kelly. Midfielder Sam Foley also joined the \"Valiants\" on a two-year contract, choosing to leave relegated Yeovil Town just after picking up Yeovil's Player of the Year award. Page further strengthened the defence and midfield by signing Walsall right-back Ben Purkiss and Crewe Alexandra defensive midfielder Anthony Grant. Page needed to find a cost-effective forward with the club both short on strikers following the departure of Tom Pope and Ben Williamson and with little funds available due to a large cut to the wage bill, and so brought in young Watford striker Uche Ikpeazu on loan, having been impressed by Ikpeazu's performances for Crewe last season. Another former Crewe favourite, A-Jay Leitch-Smith, was also signed after impressing Page during pre-season. The eighth and final summer signing was Ryan Inniss, who was confirmed as joining on a season long loan from Crystal Palace after being linked with a return to Vale Park for many weeks. On 6 August, Vale signed goalkeeper Jak Alnwick on a short-term deal; he was signed to compete with Sam Johnson for a first team place as Chris Neal was out injured at the start of the season.", "Vale began February just a point outside the play-offs after recording what Page described as an \"ugly\" 1\u20130 win over Swindon. Vale then outplayed Coventry, but needed a sensational goal from Sam Kelly to win a point and a 1\u20131 draw. Vale then rounded off a series of three successive home games with a 0\u20130 draw with Fleetwood. Injury to Alnwick meant that Neal was recalled from his loan spell at Doncaster Rovers for the trip to Sheffield United, which ended in a 1\u20130 defeat from a Billy Sharp goal. They ended the month with an impressive 3\u20131 home win over Southend to remain in touch with the play-off places.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||18||align=\"left\"| Sam Kelly", "|\u2013||MF|| Republic of Ireland||18||Sam Kelly||3||0||0||0||3", "|18|| Republic of Ireland||MF||Sam Kelly||4||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||4||0", "|align=\"center\"| Goal of the Season ||align=\"center\"| Sam Kelly (vs Coventry City, 7 February 2016)", "| 1 July 2015 || MF ||  || Sam Kelly || Norwich City || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "Sam Alexander Kelly", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sam Kelly (footballer)"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Brown decided to release 10 players at the end of the season: S\u00e9bastien Amoros, Remie Streete, JJ Hooper, Sam Johnson, Sam Kelly, Ryan Lloyd, Deniz Mehmet, Harry Pickering, Scott Tanser, and Jerome Thomas; he also arranged deals with Rigino Cicilia, Kiko, Chris Mbamba, Quentin Pereira, and Paulo Tavares so that those five players could leave their contracts early.
