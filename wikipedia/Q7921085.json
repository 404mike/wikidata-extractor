Before that band formed, he had in the mid-1960s been in a rhythm and blues cover band called The Inmates and recorded with Jimmy Cliff.He left Mott after their breakthrough 1972 album All The Young Dudes because Hunter was reluctant to record most of the songs he had written (\"Second Love\" on Brain Capers and \"Soft Ground\" on Dudes are the only songs in the Mott the Hoople canon written entirely by Allen). He is featured singing on a few Mott songs, including the demo version of \"Nightmare\", released on the (reissue) of the album Mott, as well as \"Soft Ground\" on the original release. Another song of his, \"Son of the Wise Ones\", was going to be recorded for Mott, but when Allen left he refused to give the song to the remaining members. After he left Mott, he joined up with future Pretenders members James Honeyman-Scott and Martin Chambers in a band called The Cheeks. They disbanded in 1976 after failing to get a record deal, after which Allen spent the late 1970s and early 1980s in a number of short-lived bands on his own record label, Spinit. From 1983 until 1994, Allen was entirely out of the music business, and then he made a low-key comeback with a new band named after one of Mott's earliest songs, Thunderbuck Ram. They released only one album, Long Time No See, before disbanding. On his 1999 solo album, For Each Other, Allen played all the instruments and the album was released by Angel Air Records, who reissued all the classic Mott the Hoople albums during the early 2000s.\nIn January 2009 it was confirmed that Allen and the other original members of Mott the Hoople would reform for two 40th anniversary reunion concerts in October 2009. This was later expanded to cover five dates, all at the Hammersmith Apollo. A further five-date tour followed, in November 2013, covering dates across the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mott the Hoople", "response": ["The Doc Thomas Group were formed in 1966 with Mick Ralphs on guitar, Stan Tippins on vocals, and Pete Overend Watts on bass. Ralphs and Tippins had been in a local Hereford band the Buddies, and Watts had been in a local Ross-on-Wye band the Soulents with Dale \"Buffin\" Griffin on drums. The Doc Thomas Group had a concert residency at a nightclub in a resort town in Italy. The group was offered a recording contract with the Italian label Dischi Interrecord, and released an eponymous album in January 1967. By 1968, Griffin and organist Verden Allen had joined the band.", "David Bowie had long been a fan of the band. After learning from Watts that they were about to split, he persuaded them to stay together and offered them \"Suffragette City\" from his then yet-to-be-released Ziggy Stardust album. They turned it down. Bowie also penned \"All the Young Dudes\" for them and it became their biggest hit. Released as a single in July 1972, it was a success in the UK, with the band using Tippins \u2013 who by this time was their tour manager \u2013 to sing backing vocals during concert. Bowie produced an album, also called All the Young Dudes, which included a Mick Ronson strings and brass arrangement for \"Sea Diver\". It sold well, but stalled at No.\u00a021 in the UK Albums Chart. Another casualty in the wake of All the Young Dudes was Verden Allen, who departed before the release of their next album, Mott.", "In May 1973, following Verden Allen's departure, the band was augmented by two keyboard players. Former Love Affair and Morgan member Morgan Fisher joined as keyboardist and Mick Bolton joined on Hammond Organ. Bolton left at the end of 1973 and was replaced on tour by Blue Weaver, while Fisher stayed on to become Allen's official replacement in the band. Ralphs left in August 1973 to form Bad Company and was replaced by former Spooky Tooth guitarist Luther Grosvenor. For contractual reasons, he changed his name to Ariel Bender at the suggestion of singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul for his stint with the band. According to Ian Hunter, interviewed in the documentary Ballad of Mott the Hoople, the band were in Germany with de Paul for a TV show when Mick Ralphs walked down a street bending a succession of car aerials in frustration. De Paul came out with the phrase \"aerial bender\" which Hunter later suggested to Grosvenor as a stage name.Ballad of Mott the Hoople documentary, c. 39:30", "In February 2018 it was announced that Mott the Hoople would be playing several European dates in the summer of 2018. Ian Hunter will be joined by former bandmates Morgan Fisher on keyboards and Ariel Bender on guitar. In a press release, Hunter said \"[Fisher and Bender] toured extensively with Mott and both were featured heavily on The Hoople album after Mick Ralphs and Verden Allen left the band... I know many people were disappointed when neither appeared on the 2009 and 2013 get-togethers. Hope this makes up for it!\" The line-up will also include James Mastro and Mark Bosch on guitars, Dennis DiBrizzi on keyboards, Paul Page on bass, and Steve Holley on drums.

At Chambers's first rehearsal with the group, Hynde recalled: \"We plugged in and started playing \"Precious\", and I remember clearly, I had to turn around and face the wall, I was laughing so hard, because as soon as Martin started playing with us, I knew this was it. We had the band.\" (Uncut, 1999). Martin also recalled the rehearsal \"We knew it straight away. We just locked in.\" (Rhino Entertainment Company, 2006). In the Autumn of 1981, The Pretenders cancelled their US+Canada Tour as Chambers had cut his hand, and the injury was so bad that he couldn\u2019t play for a number of weeks.

Also in 1966, again with Watts and also with Mick Ralphs, Griffin played in the Doc Thomas Group. Successful in Italy, the group performed until the summer of 1968 when further changes of band personnel took place.

Meanwhile, guitarist Mick Ralphs joined organist Verden Allen in Jimmy Cliff's backing band, The Shakedown Sound. Eventually Ralphs, Allen, vocalist Stan Tippins, bassist Overend Watts, and drummer Dale Griffin united to become Silence, who auditioned for British impresario Guy Stevens. Silence renamed themselves after Willard Manus' 1966 novel, Mott the Hoople. The band lacked a credible singer with stage presence, and the seasoned Hunter, who had by this time taken to wearing his trademark sunglasses, auditioned on a lark and was given the position. They were a critical success in the UK, where some of their most dedicated early fans included future members of the Clash. However, they could not sustain their commercial appeal, and their American tours were slow in building a following. Mott released several LPs and attracted enthusiastic live audiences, but experienced dismal sales despite the svengali-like leadership and promotion of Stevens.
