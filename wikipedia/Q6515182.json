Lee is the son of Terence Sullivan, the drummer for the rock band Renaissance and his wife, Christine Sullivan. He plays drums, piano and percussion. At the age of seven, Lee first performed with father on stage at one of Renaissance's concerts at the Apollo. He later joined the band Chapter VI. The band produced a single track called \"The King of Comedy\" and an EP called Bucket Chemistry.\nHe joined the British rock band B\u00f4a in 1994. While with B\u00f4a, he worked with producers Darren Allison and Neil Walsh. As a result of his background, Sullivan brought a rockier sound with him to the band and helped influence the band's transition from funk to rock. However, in later years, the band decided to form their own independent label called B\u00f4a Recordings. As part of B\u00f4a Recordings, Sullivan was able to put his sound production talents to good use and co-produced the album Get There (2005) with the band and Kevin Wood in a Southampton studio. In 2004, he branched out and worked on his father's new project, called Renaissant. On the Renaissant album, South of Winter, he played keyboards on a number of tracks and helped produce. Alex Caird (bass guitar from B\u00f4a) also played on the album.\nIn 2013, Lee released his first solo album titled Out and About. Alex Caird performed on two tracks. The album brought in new vocal talents; Sara Garvey is the featured vocal talent on \"Looking Back\" and Chris Thomas performs on \"Give a Little Sugar\". Other performers include Kristian Sullivan, Lee's brother, on guitar. The album was released by Moon Struck Monkey, Lee's independent record label and distributed through CD Baby.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "B\u00f4a", "response": ["B\u00f4a (stylized b\u00f4a) are an English alternative/indie band formed in London in 1993 by drummer Ed Herten, keyboard player Paul Turrell, and guitarist/vocalist Steve Rodgers. The band progressed from a funk band to a rock band over the years, as bassist Alex Caird and multi-instrumentalist Ben Henderson joined the group, and Jasmine Rodgers was added as vocalist. They produced two major albums, Twilight (2001) and Get There (2005). Their track \"Duvet\" was the opening theme song to the anime television series Serial Experiments Lain. The band was originally signed by Polystar in Japan and produced their first album 'Race of a Thousand Camels' (1998). However, the band decided to change labels and signed with Pioneer LDC (now called NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan) to produce their album Twilight (2001).
