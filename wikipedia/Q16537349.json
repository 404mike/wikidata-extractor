He was the son of the Earl of Uxbridge.

Charlotte's brother Henry Cadogan challenged Paget to a duel, but neither was hurt.Caroline then sued her husband for divorce in the Scottish courts. A divorce was granted in November 1810. Her second marriage, to the Duke of Argyll, took place at Canongate, Edinburgh, only three weeks later. It was the duke's only marriage, and there were no children. The duchess is supposed to have told Paget's brother that she had never previously known \"the superlative degree of bliss which she was now enjoying\".The duchess died in Dumbarton, Scotland, aged 60, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London.", "link_mentions": {}}}
