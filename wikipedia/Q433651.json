According to F.P. Wilson for example, \"There is no certain evidence that any dramatist before the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 dared to put upon the public stage a play based upon English history [...] so far as we know, Shakespeare was the first.\"Wilson (1969: 9) However, not all critics agree with Wilson here. For example, Michael Taylor argues that there were at least thirty-nine history plays prior to 1592, including the two-part Christopher Marlowe play Tamburlaine (1587), Thomas Lodge's The Wounds of Civil War (1588), the anonymous The Troublesome Reign of King John (1588), Edmund Ironside (1590 \u2013 also anonymous), Robert Greene's Selimus (1591) and another anonymous play, The True Tragedy of Richard III (1591). Paola Pugliatti, however, argues that the case may be somewhere between Wilson and Taylor's argument; \"Shakespeare may not have been the first to bring English history before the audience of a public playhouse, but he was certainly the first to treat it in the manner of a mature historian rather than in the manner of a worshipper of historical, political and religious myth.\"Pugliatti (1996: 52)", "However, even more telling than the difference between the details of the proposed marriages is the contrast between the two names; Bonfield in True Tragedy and Bonville in 3 Henry VI. Bonfield is never mentioned in the chronicles, and there is no known historical personage of that name. Bonville on the other hand is mentioned numerous times by both Hall and Holinshed, and is a known historical figure. However, there is a minor character named Bonfield in the Robert Greene play George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield (1587\u20131590), where he is a member of a group of staunch opponents of Edward III. George a Greene was published in quarto in 1599, and the title page states that it was performed by Sussex's Men. In 1594, Sussex's Men had performed Titus Andronicus, which, according to the title page of the 1594 quarto, was also performed by Strange's Men (i.e. Derby's Men) and Pembroke's Men. Furthermore, according to the title page of the 1595 octavo of True Tragedy, it was performed by Pembroke's Men. As such, Pembroke's Men performed both True Tragedy and Titus Andronicus, whereas Sussex's Men performed both George a Greene and Titus Andronicus, thus creating a link between True Tragedy and George a Greene, and perhaps suggesting that either Sussex's Men could have performed True Tragedy or Pembroke's Men could have performed George a Greene, or both. Taken together, the name of Bonfield \"in two historically unrelated texts performed by companies that shared scripts and personnel indicates that the name is a non-authorial interpolation by players.\"Martin (2001: 109) That this could be the case is further supported by the fact that reported texts often use material from other plays. For example, The Contention uses material from Christopher Marlowe's The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (), Edward II () and even a line from 3 Henry VI; \"If our King Henry had shook hands with death\" (1.4.103)."]}, {"page": "16th century in literature", "response": ["**Robert Greene \u2013 Greene's Groatsworth of Wit", "**Robert Greene", "**Thomas Lodge & Robert Greene \u2013 A Looking Glass for London (published)", "**Robert Greene \u2013 The Scottish Historie of James the Fourth (published)", "*1558 \u2013 Robert Greene", "*3 September 1592 \u2013 Robert Greene, English dramatist (born 1558)"]}, {"page": "1599 in literature", "response": ["*Robert Greene "]}, {"page": "1594 in literature", "response": ["*Robert Greene (published)", "*Thomas Lodge and Robert Greene \u2013 A Looking Glass for London (published)"]}, {"page": "1592 in literature", "response": ["*September 3 \u2013 The English writer Robert Greene dies in London of a \"banquet of Rhenish wine and pickled herring\",According to Thomas Nashe. having apparently completed Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit (published soon after), including a reference to \"an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers\", taken to be the first published (critical) reference to Shakespeare as a playwright.", "*Robert Greene (died September 3)", "*September 3 \u2013 Robert Greene, English writer (born 1558)"]}, {"page": "1590 in literature", "response": ["*Robert Greene", "*Robert Greene"]}, {"page": "1589 in literature", "response": ["*Robert Greene \u2013 Menaphon", "*Robert Greene \u2013 Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay"]}, {"page": "1586 in literature", "response": ["*Robert Greene \u2013 Morando, the Tritameron of Love (part 2)"]}, {"page": "1580 in literature", "response": ["*Robert Greene \u2013 Mamillia"]}, {"page": "1558 in literature", "response": ["*July 11 (baptism) \u2013 Robert Greene, English writer (died 1592)"]}, {"page": "Shoplifting", "response": ["Shoplifting, originally called \"lifting\", is as old as shopping.

As Groatsworth was registered in the Stationers' Register on 20 September 1592, this means that True Tragedy must have been on stage prior to 23 June 1592, as that was when the government shut the London theatres due to an outbreak of plague. To have been on stage by June 1592, the play was most likely written sometime in 1591.", ":Evidence: stylistically, Midsummer Night is very much part of the 'lyrical plays', which would suggest a date of composition in 1594 or 1595. A strong argument that it was written immediately after Romeo and Juliet is the nature of Pyramus and Thisbe, which features a pair of ill-fated lovers who arrange to meet in secret and which ends with the heroine killing herself over the body of her dead love. In his 1979 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, Harold F. Brooks argues that Shakespeare used the source story from Ovid's Metamorphoses first to examine the tragic potential and then to exploit its comic and farcical elements in his next play. A possible topical allusion is the line \"the death/Of learning, late decreased in beggary\" (5.1.52\u201353), which could refer to the spate of deaths of popular playwrights in the early 1590s; Robert Greene in 1592, Christopher Marlowe in 1593 and Thomas Kyd in 1594. That the play culminates with the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta has led some to theorise it may have been written specifically for a wedding, with the most likely candidates being either the marriage of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, and Elizabeth de Vere on 26 January 1595, or that of Sir Thomas Berkeley and Elizabeth Carey on 19 February 1596. That the second is the more likely of the two is due to the fact that Elizabeth's grandfather was Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, and her father was George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, successive patrons of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. If the play was written for a wedding in February 1596, it was most likely composed in 1595.

He created the parts, which were probably written especially for him. Edward Alleyn was known for his physical size and handling of commanding parts. The evidence for his stage career is otherwise fragmentary. Other parts thought to be associated with Alleyn are Orlando in Robert Greene's Orlando Furioso, and perhaps Hieronymo in The Spanish Tragedy by Thomas Kyd.Michael Hattaway, Elizabethan Popular Theatre: Plays in Performance (2005), p. 91.
