He was one of the first to realise that the lambda calculus could be used to model a programming language, an insight that is essential to development of both functional programming and denotational semantics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "ALGOL", "response": ["As Peter Landin noted, ALGOL was the first language to combine seamlessly imperative effects with the (call-by-name) lambda calculus. Perhaps the most elegant formulation of the language is due to John C. Reynolds, and it best exhibits its syntactic and semantic purity. Reynolds's idealized ALGOL also made a convincing methodologic argument regarding the suitability of local effects in the context of call-by-name languages, in contrast with the global effects used by call-by-value languages such as ML. The conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research, along with Programming Computable Functions (PCF) and ML."]}, {"page": "List of computer scientists", "response": ["* Peter Landin \u2013 ISWIM, J operator, SECD machine, off-side rule, syntactic sugar, ALGOL, IFIP WG 2.1 member, advanced lambda calculus to model programming languages (aided functional programming), denotational semantics"]}, {"page": "List of programmers", "response": ["*Peter Landin \u2013 ISWIM, J operator, SECD machine, off-side rule, syntactic sugar, ALGOL, IFIP WG 2.1 member"]}, {"page": "Lambda calculus", "response": ["As pointed out by Peter Landin's 1965 paper \"A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation\", sequential procedural programming languages can be understood in terms of the lambda calculus, which provides the basic mechanisms for procedural abstraction and procedure (subprogram) application."]}, {"page": "ISWIM", "response": ["ISWIM (acronym for If you See What I Mean) is an abstract computer programming language (or a family of languages) devised by Peter Landin and first described in his article \"The Next 700 Programming Languages\", published in the Communications of the ACM in 1966."]}, {"page": "Non-English-based programming languages", "response": ["The concept of international style programming languages was inspired by the work of British computer scientists Christopher Strachey, Peter Landin, and others.
