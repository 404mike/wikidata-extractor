In 1928, he was appointed to an assistant lectureship at the University College, Southampton. He remained there until 1946, when he moved to the University of Oxford to be a full lecturer; he was promoted to a senior lectureship two years later. He was also a lecturer (1948\u201360) and senior research fellow (from 1960) at St John's College, Oxford. He published on seventeenth-century English poetry, and also translated Germany poetry, mostly by Rilke and H\u00f6lderlin. He died after falling during a walk in Switzerland in 1963, the same year that he had been elected a fellow of the British Academy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sonnet 25", "response": ["In Sonnet 25 may allude to Essex's Rebellion. In Themes and Variations in Shakespeare's Sonnets (1961), James Blair Leishman criticised preceding approaches to Shakespeare's sonnets, feeling they either excessively focussed on the identity of \"W.H.\", the Fair Youth, the Rival Poet, or the Dark Lady; or they analysed the sonnets' style in isolation. To remedy this perceived lack, Leishman sets out to analyse the sonnets by comparison and contrast with other poets and sonneteers like Pindar, Horace and Ovid; Petrarch, Torquato Tasso, and Pierre de Ronsard; and Shakespeare's English predecessors and contemporaries Edmund Spenser, Samuel Daniel, Samuel Daniel, and John Donne. Here Leishman agrees that the sonnet contains such allusions, but argues that it is more likely to have been written, and the allusions being to, the state of affairs shortly after Essex's return from Ireland in 1599\u2014as opposed to after Essex's trial and execution in 1601\u2014when the issue was fresh in Shakespeare's mind. In this interpretation, Essex is the \"painful warrior famoused for fight\" who \"After a thousand victories\" in Ireland \"Is from the book of honor razed quite, / And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:\"."]}, {"page": "Institute of Modern Languages Research", "response": ["* James Blair Leishman Correspondence and Diaries"]}]}}
