He played most of his career in the second tier of county cricket, but did appear ten times for Somerset in first-class cricket. A right-handed batsman, Clapp began his career playing first-class cricket with Somerset in 1885, and from 1891 he alternated between both Somerset and Shropshire. He made his final county appearance in 1896, while his final recorded match was two years later. He achieved his highest first-class score of 60 not out against Hampshire in his penultimate first-class match.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Albert Clapp (1885\u20131895) 10 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Following the departure of Somerset captain Stephen Newton, who played all his first-class cricket in London from the 1885 season onwards, Sainsbury was given the club captaincy. Somerset's first county match of the season took place in mid-July, almost two months after four of the counties had contested matches. The match, played against Hampshire, showed little sign of the troubles that were to come. Sainsbury scored 0 and 13 opening the batting for his side, but the bowling of Edward Bastard, who claimed eight wickets in the first innings and three in the second, helped Somerset to a five-wicket victory. The county's next match, played two weeks later against Gloucestershire, was their heaviest defeat when losing by an innings to that point. Gloucestershire won the toss and elected to bat, totalling 448 in 190\u00a0overs; Somerset bowlers James Parfitt and Charles Winter both conceding over 100 runs. In reply, five of the Somerset batsman were out for ducks; Sainsbury, Parfitt and Albert Clapp were the only ones to reach double figures. Sainsbury top-scored with 40\u00a0runs, but a team total of 100 meant that Gloucestershire forced his side to follow-on. The second innings progressed even more poorly for Somerset. Sainsbury was one of eight batsmen who failed to reach double figures, and the team was dismissed for 80\u00a0runs, resulting in an innings and 268\u00a0run loss."]}, {"page": "George Nichols (cricketer)", "response": ["Nichols began his career at Gloucestershire, taking just three wickets as part of a bowling attack dominated by W. G. Grace. His five first-class matches for the county came over three seasons and in 1886 he moved to bordering Somerset. Somerset had just lost their first-class status, having failed to arrange a sufficient number of matches against other first-class counties in 1885. Having customarily batted as part of the tail for Gloucestershire, Nichols opened the batting alongside fellow professional Albert Clapp on his first recorded appearance for Somerset in July 1886. A highlight for Nichols during these early years at Somerset was his 6/30 during the 1887 match against Hampshire. Typifying his bowling, he bowled 32.2 overs, of which 24 were maidens."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1890", "response": ["| Albert Clapp || style=\"text-align:center\"| ||  || Right-handed || Right arm medium pace ||"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1891", "response": ["| Albert Clapp ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right arm medium pace"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885", "response": ["In their six first-class matches in 1885, Somerset fielded 26 different players. Only two appeared in all six matches: the captain Edward Sainsbury, and Charles Winter. James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual suggested in 1883 that \"professionals not being indigenous to the area [Somerset] it is feared that their advance is only temporary\".Roebuck (1991), p. 29. This prediction was particularly accurate during 1885: only Albert Clapp was a professional.Foot (1986), p. 29.

Bastard did not take part in the match, and it fell to Winter to bowl the majority of the overs in his absence. Along with his fellow opener, James Parfitt, Winter claimed three wickets, but both openers conceded over 100 runs for their wickets. Sainsbury tried eight different bowlers in an effort to take wickets, and Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 448 after 190 overs. In reply, Somerset conceded their first three wickets for 18 runs, before a brief revival took them to 61 for 3. The last seven wickets then fell for the addition of 39 more runs, and Somerset closed on 100, still trailing their opponents by overs 300 runs. Captain Edward Sainsbury top-scored for Somerset, reaching his highest total of the season, 40, and only two other batsmen reached double figures for the county: Parfitt and the professional, Albert Clapp. Five Somerset players fell for ducks. Asked by Gloucestershire to follow on, Somerset batted even more poorly in their second effort, in which Winter's total of 21 was the highest score. A total of 80 meant that they lost the match by an innings and 268 runs, their heaviest defeat in first-class cricket at that point."]}]}}
