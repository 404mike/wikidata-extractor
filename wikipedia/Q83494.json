He began his professional career at Middlesbrough in 2005, having progressed through the club's academy. After making his debut for the club in January 2006, he became a regular player, and at the age of 18 years and 47 days was the youngest man to captain Middlesbrough where he made 91 appearances and scored four goals. He switched to Wigan Athletic in July 2008. Cattermole quickly became a regular for Wigan, amassing 35 appearances in the 2008\u201309 season. After attracting interest from other Premier League clubs, he joined Sunderland in August 2009. Despite a few injury problems early in his spell at the club, manager Steve Bruce selected him as captain for the start of the 2010\u201311 season, a role he would hold for three seasons, until Paolo di Canio gave John O'Shea the role prior to the start of the 2013\u201314 season.\nInternationally, Cattermole represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stockton-on-Tees", "response": ["* Lee Cattermole, footballer"]}, {"page": "Wigan Athletic F.C.", "response": ["In the summer of 2008, Bruce signed Lee Cattermole from Middlesbrough for \u00a33.5\u00a0million, and Egyptian striker Amr Zaki sign on an initial one-year loan.

The suspended six-match ban was nearly brought into action when Barton appeared to flick Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor in the club's next match, but the FA decided not to punish Barton. However, further allegations that Barton had made a racist remark to Agbonlahor were cause enough for the FA to reconsider this decision. The remarks remain unfounded and 'professional lip-readers' claimed he said nothing racist.
