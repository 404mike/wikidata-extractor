Manager Rafa Benitez gave Ki his first start for Newcastle on 26 August against Chelsea and the following weekend against Manchester City, both resulting in 2\u20131 defeats. Benitez would then not select Ki for the next five games, invoking the player's \"lack of mobility\". He came on as a substitute to replace the injured Shelvey against Watford on 3 November and provided the game winning assist as his free kick was headed in by Ayoze P\u00e9rez to secure a 1\u20130 victory for Newcastle, their first league win of the season. From then on, he was part of Newcastle's march out of the relegation zone, jumping from bottom of the table to 15th by Christmas. His good form was halted as the South Korean had to join his national team to take part in the AFC Asian Cup in the UAE. After coming back to his club in the end of January 2019 with an achilles injury sustained in a match against the Philippines, Ki announced he would retire from his international duties to fully focus on his club career. During his absence, local youngster Sean Longstaff impressed and took over the starting spot in midfield alongside Isaac Hayden. Ki's game time became sporadic, the South Korean starting six out of the eleven remaining league games, and completing 90 minutes only twice."]}, {"page": "David Longstaff", "response": ["David is the father of Newcastle United footballers Sean Longstaff and Matty Longstaff, and a cousin of former England international footballer Alan Thompson."]}, {"page": "List of professional sports families", "response": ["|Sean Longstaff, Matty Longstaff"]}, {"page": "Longstaff", "response": ["*Sean Longstaff (born 1997), English footballer, son of David Longstaff"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["11 June 2014: Stefan Broccoli, Michael Newberry, Lewis Suddick, Ben Pollock, Luke Charman, Jamie Holmes, Jack Hunter, Louis Johnson, Sean Longstaff, Ben Smith, Jake Trodd and Dan Ward sign scholarships with the club's academy.
