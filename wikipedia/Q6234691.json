After several line-up changes and an album recorded for a minor Breton label, the band was signed to Topic records and released its official self-titled debut in 1977 with the line-up of McNeill (fiddle, vocals), Reid (keyboards, vocals), Jamie McMenemy (bouzouki, vocals), and John Gahagan (whistle). Gahagan left before the recording of the follow-up, At the Front (1978), and was replaced by Irish singer-guitarist Pat Kilbride. The departure of both Kilbride and McMenemy shortly afterward brought in Jen Clark (vocals, cittern, dulcimer) and Duncan MacGillivray (Highland pipes) for Stand Easy (1979), thus beginning Battlefield Band's tradition of using bagpipes on their albums. Clark was replaced by Northumbrian singer-guitarist Ged Foley on Home is Where the Van Is (1980), which marked a switch from Topic records to producer Robin Morton's label Temple. Home is Where the Van Is also inaugurated the band's practice of placing original songs alongside traditional material. The line-up changes continued, though the group remained based around the core of McNeill and Reid until 1990, when McNeill left to pursue a solo career. Reid finally left the band at the end of 2010, concentrating on his musical duo with guitarist & singer Rob van Sante, the Battlefield Band's sound engineer.", "#John Gahagan [1977\u20131978] (fiddle, whistle) \u2013 "]}, {"page": "Wae's me for Prince Charlie (album)", "response": ["*John Gahagan: voice (****), Irish flute, whistle, concertina, bones"]}, {"page": "Gahagan", "response": ["* John Gahagan (born 1958), Scottish former footballer who played as a left winger"]}, {"page": "1992 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|MF |||| John Gahagan || "]}, {"page": "List of Motherwell F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|John Gahagan (11)"]}, {"page": "Gahagan, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Gahagan"]}]}}
