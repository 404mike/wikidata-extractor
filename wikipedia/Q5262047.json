He then went to Leicester Polytechnic to study history and to bolster support for the already-established Young National Front Student Organisation. In the May 1979 general election, he contested Cambridge for the NF, receiving 311 votes (0.6%). After his studies Holland became closely associated with the Political Soldier wing of the party. One of the party's main writers in a time when their ideology was shifting, he contributed regularly not only to the party journal Nationalism Today, but was also co-editor of Rising, a radical nationalist journal that was independent of the NF and drew heavily from Julius Evola and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Holland became one of the leading lights on the Political Soldier wing of the party when his pamphlet The Political Soldier was published in 1984. Along with Nick Griffin and Patrick Harrington he became effective joint leader of the Official National Front following the resignation of Andrew Brons from overall leadership in 1984. In 1988 the three travelled to Libya on a fund-raising trip as an official representatives of the NF, although in the end they were given only copies of The Green Book.In 1989, Holland broke with Patrick Harrington and joined Michael Fishwick in following Nick Griffin and Roberto Fiore into the International Third Position (ITP) after Harrington had contacted The Jewish Chronicle with regards to opening dialogue. Holland injected his sympathies for anti-Zionist groups, as part of his nationalist philosophy, into the ITP. He supported the ideas of Muammar Gaddafi and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who had previously featured on a cover of National Front News.\nHolland's last public appearance was at a Swedish nationalist convention in 2002, during this time Holland lived in the Irish Midlands where he sought grants from the local Community Enterprise Board for his involvement in the proposed publishing of the \"IHS Books however when he sought to use a different address to his home address he was not seen for some time after that, his present whereabouts is unknown following his past involvement with Nick Griffin coming to light.\n,   (hosted by Nationaldemokratisk Ungdom, the youth wing of the National Democrats). Since that time the ITP appears to have gravitated towards the European National Front, and Holland has retired from active involvement in politics, although his Political Soldier writings are still circulated among radical nationalists. In 2001 Holland co-founded with John Sharp IHS Books, a publisher whose stated purpose was to bring back into print classics of Catholic social teaching but which has been accused of fascist and anti-semitic connections.Holland has received considerable treatment in works on European extremist nationalism, including Fascism: A History by Roger Eatwell (1997) and Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (2002). Holland\u2019s writings on the Political Soldier are also featured in Fascism: A Reader published by Oxford University Press (1995).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "National Front (UK)", "response": ["Reflecting the Nouvelle Droite's influence, the Strasserite Official NF promoted support for \"a broad front of racialists of all colours\" who were seeking an end to multi-racial society and capitalism, praising black nationalists like Louis Farrakhan and Marcus Garvey. Their publication, Nationalism Today, featured positive articles on the Libyan and Iranian governments, presenting them as part of a global anti-capitalist and anti-Marxist third force. This may have had tactical as well as ideological motivations, with Libya and Iran viewed as potential sources of funding. This new ideology alienated many NF members. The Official NF experienced internal problems and in 1989 Griffin, Derek Holland and Colin Todd split from it to establish the International Third Position. In March 1990 the Official NF was disbanded by its leaders, Patrick Harrington, Graham Williamson and David Kerr, who replaced it with a new organisation, the Third Way. This left the Flag Group as the only party using the National Front banner."]}, {"page": "Patrick Harrington (activist)", "response": ["In the late 1980s, the National Front underwent a schism. Harrington sided with the Political Soldier group that included Nick Griffin (who later became leader of the British National Party) and Derek Holland. This group eventually termed itself the Official National Front. The ideas of Harrington and his allies led to alienation of some NF supporters with the Flag Group splitting off to follow more traditional NF ideas.N. Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 45  Harrington was involved in one of the manifestations of these divisions in the 1989 Vauxhall by-election when, as a candidate, one of his opponents was Ted Budden of the Flag Group. In September 1988, the three men visited Libya as a guest of the Gaddafi regime. In October, the Political Soldier NF was the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, Disciples of Chaos in which Harrington was interviewed."]}, {"page": "Political Soldier", "response": ["Political Soldier is a political concept associated with the Third Position. It played a leading role in Britain's National Front from the late 1970s onwards under young radicals Nick Griffin, Patrick Harrington and Derek Holland of the Official National Front. The term was used to indicate an almost fanatical devotion to the cause of nationalism, which its supporters felt was needed to bring about a revolutionary change in society."]}, {"page": "International Third Position", "response": ["Though a key formulator of the Third Positionist platform, Nick Griffin left in 1990. After about four years he joined the British National Party (BNP), where he later succeeded the BNP founder John Tyndall. Other leading figures in the group on its foundation were Roberto Fiore and Derek Holland. Jason Wilcock would subsequently emerge as the group's leader, although in 2001 he was reported in the Daily Mirror as having played a leading role in instigating the riots in Oldham."]}]}}
