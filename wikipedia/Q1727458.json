C. Wallace conceptualized the \"Tuka movement\"  as a  revitalization movement. Peter Worsley's analysis of cargo cults placed the emphasis on the economic and political causes of these popular movements. He viewed them as \"proto-national\" movements by indigenous peoples seeking to resist colonial interventions. He observed a general trend away from millenarianism towards secular political organization through political parties and cooperatives. Theodore Schwartz was the first to emphasize that both Melanesians and Europeans place great value on the demonstration of wealth. \"The two cultures met on the common ground of materialistic competitive striving for prestige through entrepreneurial achievement of wealth.\" Melanesians felt \"relative deprivation\" in their standard of living, and thus came to focus on cargo as an essential expression of their personhood and agency."]}, {"page": "Karel Reisz", "response": ["He came to England in 1938, speaking almost no English, but eradicated his foreign accent as quickly as possible.
