Duncan was replaced as Ipswich manager by Alf Ramsey three weeks later, and Leadbetter, then an inside forward, made his Ipswich debut in the Football League Third Division South on 8 October 1955 in a 1\u20130 home win over Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. This was his only game until December, but he then took over from George MacLuckie at outside left, earning a regular first team place. He continued his fine form at Portman Road and helped Ipswich win the division title in 1956\u201357, earning promotion to the Second Division. Whilst at Ipswich, Ramsey converted Leadbetter from an outside left to a more withdrawn left-winger role. He began to play deeper, threading through passes or providing crosses for the prolific goalscoring partnership of Ray Crawford and Ted Phillips. This was to be the prototype for Ramsey's Wingless Wonders, with which he won the 1966 World Cup. Ramsey later admitted \"Yes, he was Scottish, but I owed him so much.\"Jimmy Leadbetter: Midfield inspiration to Alf Ramsey The Independent, 19 July 2006"]}, {"page": "George McLuckie", "response": ["#REDIRECT George MacLuckie"]}, {"page": "MacLuckie, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge MacLuckie"]}]}}
