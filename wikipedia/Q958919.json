Gould regained his international place and the captaincy on his return for the 1892 Home Nations Championship. The tournament was a failure for Wales; the team lost all three of their matches. There was little consistency for Gould at centre, with three different centre-pairings in each of the matches; Garrett against England, Conway Rees at home to Scotland and in the Irish encounter, Gould's younger brother Bert. The 1892 Championship was soured by the aftermath of the Wales\u2013Scotland encounter, which was played in Swansea at St. Helen's. After Wales lost the game 7\u20132, members of the crowd, angered by Jack Hodgson's refereeing of the game, attacked him. The assailants by-passed the police and the referee had to be rescued by members of the Welsh team. In the struggle, Gould was struck on the chin, and it was reported that Hodgson only reached the Mackworth Hotel because Gould accompanied him on the coach.", "The English played the first half with the wind behind them and their nine-man scrum dominated the smaller Welsh pack. At half time Wales were 7\u20130 down following tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain Andrew Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in the first half of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the halfway line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Edwin Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed."]}, {"page": "Rees (surname)", "response": ["* Conway Rees (1870\u20131932), Welsh rugby union international"]}, {"page": "Llandovery", "response": ["*Conway Rees (1870\u20131932), rugby union player for Wales, and schoolmaster in England and India"]}, {"page": "John Rees", "response": ["*Conway Rees (1870\u20131932), John Conway Rees, Welsh rugby union international"]}, {"page": "1932 in Wales", "response": ["*30 August \u2013 Conway Rees, Wales rugby union international, 62"]}, {"page": "Oxford University RFC", "response": ["*  Conway Rees"]}, {"page": "1870 in Wales", "response": ["*13 January \u2014 Conway Rees, rugby player (died 1932)"]}, {"page": "1892 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), Tom Pearson (Cardiff), William McCutcheon (Swansea), Arthur Gould (Newport) capt., Conway Rees (Llanelli), Evan James (Swansea), David James (Swansea), Frank Mills (Swansea), Charles Nicholl (Llanelli), Tom Graham (Newport), Jim Hannan (Newport), Tom Deacon (Swansea), Arthur Boucher (Newport), Percy Bennett (Cardiff Harlequins), Wallace Watts (Newport)"]}, {"page": "1893 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), Norman Biggs (Cardiff), William McCutcheon (Swansea), Arthur Gould (Newport) capt., Conway Rees (Llanelli), Percy Phillips (Newport), Fred Parfitt (Newport), Frank Mills (Swansea), Charles Nicholl (Llanelli), Harry Day (Newport), Jim Hannan (Newport), Frank Hill (Cardiff), Arthur Boucher (Newport), Tom Graham (Newport), Wallace Watts (Newport)"]}, {"page": "1894 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Billy Bancroft (Swansea), Norman Biggs (Cardiff), William McCutcheon (Oldham), Arthur Gould (Newport) capt., Conway Rees (Llanelli), Percy Phillips (Newport), Fred Parfitt (Newport), Frank Mills (Swansea), Charles Nicholl (Llanelli), David Daniel (Llanelli), Jim Hannan (Newport), Frank Hill (Cardiff), Arthur Boucher (Newport), Tom Graham (Newport), Wallace Watts (Newport)"]}, {"page": "John Conway Rees", "response": ["#REDIRECT Conway Rees"]}, {"page": "John Rees (rugby union)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Conway Rees"]}, {"page": "Bert Gould", "response": ["Gould was one of five brothers who played rugby for Newport, including Welsh internationals Arthur and Robert.
