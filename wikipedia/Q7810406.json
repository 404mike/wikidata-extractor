He was particularly interested in the use of sport within ministry, and founded a church football team in the town of Barnsley which became the modern Barnsley F.C.\nIn 1883 he moved to London to become curate of a church in Islington, and later opened a nearby mission.  He opened a boxing club at the mission and organised dances for local flower sellers.  In recognition of his work, he was appointed a prebendary of St. Pauls Cathedral in 1926.  He died two years later and is buried in Islington Cemetery.  In the 1990s supporters of Barnsley F.C. located and restored his grave.", "link_mentions": {}}}
