In the New Statesman, Douglas Alexander, then Shadow Foreign Secretary and Member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, who lost his seat in 2015 to the SNP, wrote that the title of the book was 'outdated', citing the 2012 Scottish local elections as evidence of a Labour recovery.

In The Herald, Iain Macwhirter wrote, 'the book is sometimes a little ponderously written, but it is comprehensive and authoritative, and the authors are to be congratulated for writing the first major study of the Scottish Labour Party.'"]}]}}
