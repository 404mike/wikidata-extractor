As a broadcaster, he presented BBC Radio 2's The Best of Jazz for forty years, and hosted the comedy panel game I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue on BBC Radio 4, becoming the UK's oldest panel game host.\nLyttelton was also a cartoonist, collaborating on the long-running Flook series in the Daily Mail, and a calligrapher and president of The Society for Italic Handwriting.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 25", "response": ["*2008 \u2013 Humphrey Lyttelton, English trumpet player, composer, and radio host (b. 1921)"]}, {"page": "May 23", "response": ["*1921 \u2013 Humphrey Lyttelton, British jazz musician and broadcaster (d. 2008)"]}, {"page": "1921", "response": ["** Humphrey Lyttelton, British jazz musician, radio personality (d. 2008)"]}, {"page": "The Archers", "response": ["* Others who have made appearances include Britt Ekland, Humphrey Lyttelton (1956), Dame Edna Everage and Antony Gormley (2009)."]}, {"page": "I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue", "response": ["After a period of split chairmanship in the first series, Humphrey Lyttelton (\"Humph\") served in this role from the programme's inception until his death in 2008. In April 2008, following the hospitalisation and subsequent death of Lyttelton, recording of the 51st series was postponed. The show recommenced on 15 June 2009 with Lyttelton being replaced by three hosts: Stephen Fry, Jack Dee and Rob Brydon. Dee went on to host all episodes of the 52nd series later that year, and continues in that role. The chairman's script was most recently written by Iain Pattinson, who worked on the show from 1992 until his death in 2021.", "The pilot episode (at that time titled I'm Sorry, They're At It Again) opened with Graeme Garden and Jo Kendall singing the words of \"Three Blind Mice\" to the tune of \"Ol' Man River\" followed by Bill Oddie and Tim Brooke-Taylor performing the lyrics of \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\" to the melody of \"These Foolish Things\". Dave Lee, who was bandleader on I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, was at the piano and a number of rounds were introduced by a short phrase of music. Other rounds included \"Dialogue Read in a Specific Accent\" and \"Songs Sung as Animals\". In 1974 Bill Oddie was replaced by Willie Rushton, with Barry Cryer as Graeme Garden's teammate, and Humphrey Lyttelton as chairman, and the personnel remained constant from this point until Rushton's death in 1996, although occasional guest panellists appeared in the 1980s and early 1990s (see below). Since then the panel has featured a variety of guest comedians.", "Humphrey Lyttelton, primarily known as a jazz trumpeter and bandleader, was invited to be chairman because of the role played by improvisation in both comedy and jazz music. In the first series Lyttelton shared the role of chairman with Barry Cryer but he made it his own (especially once Cryer replaced Cleese as a regular panellist) and continued as chairman until his death on 25 April 2008. He read the script introducing the programme and segments in an utterly deadpan manner. He claimed the secret was just to read what was in front of him without understanding why it was funny. He adopted the grumpy persona of someone who would really rather be somewhere else, which he attributed to worrying that, surrounded by four professional comedians, he would have nothing worthwhile to chip in. He did occasionally depart from the script, however, often bringing the house down with an ad-lib. He was credited by the regular panellists as being the chief reason for the show's longevity.", "On 18 April 2008 the producer of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, Jon Naismith, announced that, owing to hospitalisation to repair an aortic aneurysm, Humphrey Lyttelton would be unable to record the scheduled shows and that they would have to be postponed. The final show of the 2008 Best of tour on 22 April would be presented by Rob Brydon. Following Lyttelton's death there was speculation that the series might be cancelled because replacing him would be extremely difficult if not impossible. In a eulogy in The Guardian, Barry Cryer did not allude to the future of the programme but said that there's \"got to be an agonising reappraisal\" and that Lyttelton was the \"very hub of the show\". Cryer, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden all ruled themselves out as hosts: Cryer did not think the programme would work if a panellist became chairman and it \"would need somebody of stature to be parachuted in\". Jeremy Hardy also ruled himself out, saying \"Humph had big shoes to fill and I wouldn't do it.\"", "Since 18 May 1985 (in the same episode as Kenny Everett made his debut) the show has included a fictional and completely silent scorer \"whose job is eased by the fact no points are actually awarded\", usually \"the lovely Samantha\" who sits on Humph's left hand. There is a seat with a microphone next to the Chairman which is \"used\" by Samantha. During the introductory music Humphrey Lyttelton would stand up and \"help\" Samantha into her seat. In practice the seat and microphone were only used by the producer to welcome the audience, to introduce the participants and to give any other information to the audience such as the expected date of broadcasting, and to supervise re-recordings of fluffs made in the programme.", "The regular panellists are represented by the chairman to be unfunny, struggling comedians who have been doing the same act for many years. Further to this, supposed personalities of the panellists by the chairman, fictitious but drawn from their public personas, is also a recurring theme, with Barry Cryer often represented as a tight-fisted alcoholic who can't wait to get to the pub (but who never buys a round of drinks), whilst Tim Brooke-Taylor was often represented as willing to take any small performance job in his quiet career, and always campaigning for a repeat of The Goodies (something which Brooke-Taylor himself played upon in many rounds). The late Humphrey Lyttelton often delivered mock comments of how boring and low quality the show was and, particularly in his later years on the show, often preferring to doze off than listen to the rounds. Pianist Colin Sell, meanwhile, is often the butt of many jokes regarding his supposedly terrible musical skills (despite in reality being an accomplished musician).", "Chairman Humphrey Lyttelton frequently poked fun at Just a Minute and its chairman Nicholas Parsons, something which Lyttelton's successor Jack Dee has continued with and expanded upon, mimicking Parsons by constantly emphasising the long experience of some panellists, and the fact that the programme can be heard all over the world.", "* 1995: featuring Humphrey Lyttelton, Barry Cryer, Graeme Garden, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Willie Rushton", "* Tuesday 22 April 2008 \u2013 Pavilion Theatre (Bournemouth) (Due to Humphrey Lyttelton's hospitalisation, the show was presented by Rob Brydon)"]}, {"page": "Mornington Crescent (game)", "response": ["The origins of the game are not clear.

Lyttelton agreed to perform on the song with his band after his daughter showed him Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer.
