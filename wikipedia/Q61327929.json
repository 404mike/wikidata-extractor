In 1909 she was arrested a third time, in this case for stenciling a passage from the Bill of Rights on a wall of the House of Commons which read, \"It is the right of the subject to petition the King, and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal.\" It was upon being arrested for this offense on 2 July 1909 that she commenced her first hunger strike."]}, {"page": "Mary Phillips (suffragette)", "response": ["In November 1909, Phillips wrote to Christabel Pankhurst asking to be relieved of a militant role, which was fully supported and she had no further trouble for the next three years. Around that time she was given the job of being the WSPU organiser in Liverpool but this was short lived and Ada Flatman took over that role.  In 1910 Phillips was sent as WSPU organiser for Bradford, when Mrs Pankhurst wrote to her seeking her help to ensure that the women's group did not express sympathy for the loss of Pankhurst's 20-year old son Harry, who had died of polio, by saying ' I want to get through my work, and I know you will all help me do it'."]}, {"page": "Sarah Jane Baines", "response": ["One of the first to advocate militant methods, Baines was imprisoned some fifteen times for her part in protests. In July 1909 with twelve others, including Mary Leigh, Lucy Burns, Alice Paul, Emily Davison and Mabel Capper and another in her wheelchair [May Billinghurst perhaps] she was jailed for obstruction for trying to stop Lloyd George's public budget meeting in Limehouse.  The protest was witnessed by Annie Barnes who was inspired to join the East London Federation and influenced by Sylvia Pankhurst. On the way to Holloway prison the women arrested had shouted and sung protests and demanded to be treated in 'first division' in their own clothes as 'political' prisoners rather than criminals, this was not granted and the women broke 150 panes of glass at the prison and refused to give their names, prison officers had to use 'force necessary' to get the women into prison clothes. In Liverpool, in 1910, Baines was making speeches with Ada Flatman and Patricia Woodlock, when she was interrupted by Constance Lytton disguised as 'Jane Wharton' a seamstress asking 'the men and women of Liverpool to be the first to wipe out the stain [of force-feeding]' and a crowd followed them to the prison Governor John Dillon's house, chased by police."]}, {"page": "Alice Stewart Ker", "response": ["In 1893, Ker became involved in the Birkenhead and Wirral Women's Suffrage Society, and after her husband's death in 1907, her interest in women's suffrage became an increasing priority for her. She became chair of the local Suffrage Society but finding them too moderate, in 1907 with Alice Morrissey, she joined the more progressive Women's Social and Political Union. Ker worked with Ada Flatman who was a WSPU employee. Flatman and Patricia Woodlock organised the WSPU shop which raised substantial funds for the cause."]}, {"page": "Jessie Stephenson", "response": ["Stephenson joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), and donated some of her earnings from teaching to their cause, before returning to work in London for a barrister.

It proved a useful development with 50 new members one month and profits of \u00a3120 from sales during April\u2013November 1909. However, there were disagreements on priorities for branch activities such as street meetings for working women, or more 'At Homes' among the wealthier women, which were by invitation, but helped fundraising.", "In 1910, Woodlock and Ada Flatman and Jennie Baines were main speakers at a Liverpool event for 'Jane Warton'  - who was WSPU leader Lady Constance Lytton in disguise - her aim was to experience arrest, hunger strike and force-feeding (as an ordinary working woman). That event was attended by 300 men and women, who processed on to the Prison Governor's house to call for 'Liverpool to be the first 'to wipe out the stain' of force-feeding."]}, {"page": "Ada S.

Morrissey also became District Secretary of the Women's Cooperative Guild (WCG) in 2011."]}, {"page": "Hattie Mahood", "response": ["\"The ethics of militant tactics\" was the subject of a talk also in 1910 by Mahood in New Brighton. In June, she spoke at Birkenhead along with suffrage leaders Dr Alice Ker and Ada Flatman at the town's Park Gates. She took part in two major suffrage events in the summer of 1910. The first was again at the Park Gates, Birkenhead after a procession through the town of all the local men's and women's suffrage societies, and other reform organisations such as the Independent Labour Party, the Artists\u2019 Suffrage League and the Pembroke Social Reform League; many of the organisations\u2019 contingents carried banners.\u00a0 Mahood was on the second platform, and moved support for the Conciliation Bill. The Birkenhead News reported the demonstration extensively. Mrs Mahood was asked \"Do women aspire to enter Parliament if they get a vote\". She answered 'when you have got one right, there is no reason why we should not ask for another.'"]}]}}
