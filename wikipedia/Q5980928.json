Dave McKearney saw an early chance to score go wide of the York goal before Crewe goalkeeper Mark Smith held a shot from Jon McCarthy.  Steve Walters then struck a shot after interplay between Naylor and Ward, but Kiely caught the ball.  Mark Smith then caught a header from Ian Blackstone following a cross from Paul Atkin, before denying a cross-cum-shot from Barnes.   A mistake from Crewe's Neil Lennon allowed Tony Canham to shoot from the edge of the penalty area but the attempt went over the crossbar.  Swann then struck the ball over the Crewe goal before York's Wayne Hall prevented Ward from shooting.
