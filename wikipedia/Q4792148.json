She was the first woman to hold either position. Foster was a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Fermanagh and South Tyrone from 2003 to 2021.\nFoster served in the Northern Ireland Executive as Minister of the Environment from 2007 to 2008, Minister for Enterprise and Investment from 2008 to 2015 and Minister for Finance and Personnel from 2015 to 2016. In December 2015, Foster was elected unopposed to succeed Peter Robinson as leader of the DUP. In January 2016, Foster became First Minister of Northern Ireland and shared power with Martin McGuinness.\nMcGuinness resigned as deputy First Minister in January 2017 amid the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal, which involved a green energy scheme that Foster set up during her time as Minister for Enterprise and Investment. The scheme was set to cost the taxpayer \u00a3490 million and there were allegations of corruption surrounding Foster's role in implementing the scheme. McGuinness asked Foster to step aside as First Minister while her involvement in the scheme was investigated, but she refused to step aside or resign and said that the voices calling for her resignation were those of \"misogynists and male chauvinists\". Under the terms of the Northern Ireland power-sharing agreement, the First and deputy First Ministers are equal and, therefore, Foster could not remain in her post as First Minister and was subsequently removed from office. McGuinness's resignation caused a 2017 snap assembly election to be held, in which the DUP lost 10 seats. After no party received an outright majority in the 2017 general election, the DUP entered into an agreement with the Conservative Party to support Prime Minister Theresa May's government. In January 2020, she became First Minister of Northern Ireland again after the Executive was reinstated under the terms of the New Decade, New Approach agreement.\nOn 28 April 2021, after more than 20 DUP MLAs and four DUP MPs signed a letter \"...voicing no confidence in her leadership\", Foster announced that she would resign as party leader and as First Minister. She was succeeded by Edwin Poots as DUP leader on 28 May 2021.

In October 2017, the DUP held a similar reception at the Conservative Party conference, which was attended by leading Conservative figures including First Secretary of State Damian Green, Brexit Secretary David Davis, then-Chief Whip Gavin Williamson, and party chairman Patrick McLoughlin.

The DUP was also recently endorsed at the 2017 general election by the Loyalist Communities Council, an umbrella group of loyalist paramilitary groups, which are proscribed terrorist organisations.

The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest to Power. Oxford University Press, 2014. p.155 The DUP campaigned against the legalisation of homosexual acts, which it believed to be a \"harmful deviance\" linked to paedophilia, in Northern Ireland through the \"Save Ulster from Sodomy\" campaign between 1977\u201382, and the party has vetoed the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland since 2015, making Northern Ireland the only region of the UK where same-sex marriage is not permitted, although provision is now being made under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019. Former DUP minister Jim Wells called the issue a \"red line\" for power-sharing talks, adding that \"Peter will not marry Paul in Northern Ireland\". The party attempted to introduce a \"conscience clause\" into law in Northern Ireland, which would let businesses refuse to provide a service if it went against their religious beliefs. This came after a Christian-owned bakery was taken to court for refusing to make a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan.
