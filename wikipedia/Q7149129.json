He appeared three times for England Youth in a tournament in 1983, and played another five games the following year. He began his career at Sunderland, and helped the \"Black Cats\" to the Third Division title in 1987\u201388. He joined Port Vale for a \u00a320,000 fee in June 1988, but soon became blighted by injury. He was loaned out to Stafford Rangers and Hartlepool United to help to regain his fitness, but was\nforced to retire from professional football on medical advice in January 1991.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["In May 1987, Smith was appointed manager at Sunderland, who had just been relegated into the Third Division for the first time in their history. York were unwilling to release him from his contract for less than \u00a320,000 compensation, and Sunderland would only go as far as pay \u00a310,000. Smith agreed to a \u00a340,000-a-year contract that meant if he failed to win promotion with Sunderland in his first season he would pay the extra \u00a310,000 compensation himself. He brought his York coaching staff with him: Viv Busby, Malcolm Crosby, and Roger Jones. He also signed former York player John MacPhail to shore up the defence, who captained the team and scored 16 goals (including 10 penalties) in his maiden season at Roker Park. He signed right-back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left-back Reuben Agboola, centre-back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for \u00a380,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates; the pair scored 42 goals between them in 1987\u201388. A 7\u20130 win over Southend United started a run of 15 league matches unbeaten, though in the second half of the campaign a run of just 2 wins in 10 matches set them back. Smith bought Swansea City winger Colin Pascoe in March 1988, and oversaw a run of seven wins in the final eight matches to secure the Third Division championship and promotion with 93 points."]}, {"page": "David Riley (footballer)", "response": ["He joined Third Division club Port Vale in October 1987, manager John Rudge splashing out \u00a320,000. He scored on his debut at Vale Park in a 2\u20131 win over Bristol Rovers on 19 October. He became the club's joint-top scorer in the 1987\u201388 season with 10 goals, along with Darren Beckford. He then switched to left-wing to cover for the injured Paul Atkinson. He played 48 league and cup games in the 1988\u201389 season, but broke his leg in a 1\u20131 draw at Bolton Wanderers on 25 April 1989, and so missed out on the play-off final victory over Bristol Rovers. He managed to recover, but did not re-capture his first team position and in March 1990 was loaned back to Peterborough United, who were then under Mark Lawrenson's stewardship; Peterborough paid \u00a340,000 for his services on a permanent basis the next month."]}, {"page": "John Jeffers", "response": ["Jeffers turned professional at Kenny Dalglish's Liverpool in October 1986, but was never able to provide too much first-team competition for John Barnes, and never featured at Anfield. He was loaned out to Port Vale as cover for the injured Paul Atkinson in December 1988; he was recalled by the \"Reds\" in February 1989 but was brought back to Port Vale permanently the next month for a fee of \u00a330,000. To fund the transfer Rudge sold Steve Harper to Preston North End for \u00a335,000. He featured in 15 Third Division games in the 1988\u201389 season, and featured in all four play-off games, including both legs of the play-off final victory over Bristol Rovers. He scored his first league goal on 4 November 1989, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Oxford United at Vale Park. He played a total of 46 games in the 1989\u201390 season, as the \"Valiants\" posted a top-half finish in the Second Division. He scored twice in 36 games during the 1990\u201391 campaign, but started to become plagued by abdominal injuries from March onwards. He scored three goals in 38 appearances in the 1991\u201392 season, as the \"Valiants\" suffered relegation in last place. He scored twice in 34 games in the 1992\u201393 season, but did not feature at Wembley either in the League Trophy Final win over Stockport County or the play-off Final defeat to West Bromwich Albion. He did though help John Rudge's side to win promotion with a second-place finish in the 1993\u201394 campaign; they finished just one point behind champions Reading. He lost his first-team place in the 1994\u201395 season, as Vale posted a 17th-place finish in the second tier (known as the First Division due to the creation of the Premier League)."]}, {"page": "Paul Atkinson", "response": ["Paul Atkinson may refer to:", "*Paul Atkinson (footballer, born 1961), English football player who played for Oldham, Watford and Burnley", "*Paul Atkinson (footballer, born 1966), English football player who played for Sunderland and Port Vale", "*Paul Atkinson (guitarist) (1946\u20132004), pop guitarist in The Zombies", "*Paul Atkinson (confessor) (1655\u20131729), English Roman Catholic priest", "*Paul Atkinson (basketball) (born 1997), American basketball player"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw Vale Park given a \u00a340,000 upgrade to repair the floodlights, whilst a \u00a320,000 electronic scoreboard was installed at the Hamil End. Three executive boxes were also purchased from Newcastle United, whilst facilities were opened to the local community. Manager John Rudge made a \u00a340,000 offer for Bristol City's left-sided midfielder Alan Walsh, which was rejected. He also made inquiries for Nigel Gleghorn and Marc North. Ray Walker put in a transfer request, which was rejected. Rudge's first purchase of the season was Sunderland's left-sided midfielder Paul Atkinson, with a tribunal setting the fee at \u00a320,000; Rudge stated that he \"has the ability to produce the sort of crosses that win games\". His next target was a striker, though he had a \u00a370,000 bid for Hull City's Andy Saville rejected. Attempts to capture Imre Varadi, Wayne Biggins, Keith Bertschin, Andy Jones, and John Pearson all failed. Ian Moores began training with the club, but was not offered a contract. Despite interest from at least three other clubs (particularly Mansfield Town), Rudge signed Ron Futcher, Bradford City's top-scorer, for a \u00a335,000 fee. The veteran striker said \"I could have done better for myself elsewhere, but Vale have a lot more potential.\" Another new arrival was young Brighton & Hove Albion goalkeeper Trevor Wood on a free transfer. The Vale were unbeaten in their seven pre-season friendlies, beating second tier rivals Stoke City 1\u20130 in the process. They also recorded wins over Newcastle Town (6\u20131), Brandon (2\u20131), Spennymoor (3\u20130), and Kidderminster Harriers (4\u20130), and drew 2\u20132 with Walsall and 1\u20131 with Crewe Alexandra.

Progress came at a price though, as new signing Paul Atkinson was sidelined after chipping a bone in his ankle. Vale won the home leg against Ipswich 1\u20130, as they proved the equal of their Second Division opponents. However they were knocked out of the competition with a 3\u20130 defeat at Portman Road, Ipswich's speedy-attacking play proving too much for the Vale to handle in rainy conditions.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Paul Atkinson", "|\u2013||MF||||Paul Atkinson||3||0||0||0||0||3", "| June 1988 || MF ||  || Paul Atkinson || Sunderland || \u00a320,000 || ", "| January 1989 || MF ||  || Paul Atkinson || Stafford Rangers || January 1989 || "]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["| March 1990 || MF ||  || Paul Atkinson || Hartlepool United || End of season || "]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["| January 1991 || MF ||  || Paul Atkinson || Gateshead || Retired || "]}, {"page": "Paul Atkinson (footballer born 1966)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Atkinson (footballer, born 1966)"]}]}}
