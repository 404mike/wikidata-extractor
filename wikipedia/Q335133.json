After serving as a Member of Parliament for Carnarvon and then for Milborne Port, he took part in the Flanders Campaign and then commanded the cavalry for Sir John Moore's army in Spain during the Peninsular War; his cavalry showed distinct superiority over their French counterparts at the Battle of Sahag\u00fan and at the Battle of Benavente, where he defeated the elite chasseurs of the French Imperial Guard. During the Hundred Days he led the charge of the heavy cavalry against Comte d'Erlon's column at the Battle of Waterloo. At the end of the battle he lost part of one leg to a cannonball. In later life he served twice as Master-General of the Ordnance and twice as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 29", "response": ["*1854 \u2013 Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, English field marshal and politician, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (b. 1768)"]}, {"page": "May 17", "response": ["*  1768   \u2013 Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, English general and politician, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (d. 1854)"]}, {"page": "1854", "response": ["* April 29 \u2013 Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, British general (b. 1768)"]}, {"page": "1768", "response": ["** Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey, English general (d. 1854)"]}, {"page": "Harry Flashman", "response": ["Fraser gave Flashman a lifespan from 1822 to 1915 and a birth-date of 5 May.
