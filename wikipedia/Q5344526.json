He rejected deference to past juridical opinion (taqlid) in favor of independent reasoning (ijtihad), and opposed using local customs. He urged his followers to \"return to the primary sources\" of Islam in order \"to determine how the Qur'an and Muhammad dealt with specific situations\" without considering interpretations of previous Islamic scholarship, when employing ijtihad. According to Edward Mortimer, it was imitation of past judicial opinion in the face of clear contradictory evidence from hadith or Qur'anic text that Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab condemned.Mortimer, Edward, Faith and Power: The Politics of Islam, Vintage Books, 1982, p. 61 According to Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab and his followers, God's commandments to obey Him alone and follow the Prophetic teachings, necessitated a complete adherence to Qur'an and Hadith.
