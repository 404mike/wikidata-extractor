Anstey\u2019s contributions impact every major area of seismic exploration -\u2013 from seismic acquisition to seismic processing to interpretation to research. He is the holder of over 50 multinational patents. He is best known by many geoscientists for distilling the geophysical concepts of the seismic method into non-mathematical teachings for seismic interpreters.\nAnstey\u2019s work in seismic exploration has spanned 7 decades.[1]  Upon graduation from the University of Bristol in 1948, he joined Seismograph Service Ltd. (SSL) and spent five years in the Middle East and the West Indies as an observer on a seismic crew.  In 1953, he returned to the UK as a research geophysicist.  He wrote a number of seminal papers while at SSL.  In 1968, he established the European offices of Seiscom Delta.  In 1975, he left the company to focus on teaching and consulting.  He has written many books, monographs, and journal articles, as well as being a Distinguished Lecturer for the SEG. The Nigel Anstey Award [2] for Best Paper in \"First Break\", the flagship journal of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers, is named in his honor. He is still an active contributor to the field of seismic exploration.\nHe is the grandfather of Tom Felton and played alongside him in the movie Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as a teacher at Hogwarts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of geophysicists", "response": ["* Nigel Anstey (British, 1927\u2013 ) \u2013 exploration geophysicist ; Maurice Ewing Medal (SEG)"]}, {"page": "Tom Felton", "response": ["Thomas Andrew Felton was born on 22 September 1987 in Epsom, Surrey, the youngest of four sons born to Peter Felton and Sharon Anstey.
