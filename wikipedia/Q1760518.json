Because of their increasing ambivalence they are ascribed to both late Romanticism and the Post-Romantic. Her first major breakthrough came with The Improvisatrice and from thence she developed the metrical romance towards the Victorian ideal of the Victorian monologue, casting her influence on Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning and Christina Rossetti. Her influence can also be found in Alfred Tennyson and in America, where she was very popular. Poe regarded her genius as self-evident.In spite of these wide influences, due to the perceived immorality of Landon's lifestyle, her works were more or less deliberately suppressed and misrepresented after her death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 14", "response": ["*1802 \u2013 Letitia Elizabeth Landon, English poet and novelist (d. 1838)"]}, {"page": "Antonio Canova", "response": ["Two of Canova's works appear as engravings in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834, with poetical illustrations by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.

During the Damascus affair of 1840 the false accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. The massacre of Christians in 1860 was also one of the most notorious incidents of these centuries, when fighting between Druze and Maronites in Mount Lebanon spilled over into the city. Several thousand Christians were killed in June 1860, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile Abd al-Qadir and his soldiers (three days after the massacre started), who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir's residence and the Citadel of Damascus. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including a number of churches, was burnt down.

Early in the 19th century, Henry Thomson painted Juliet after the Masquerade, an  of which was published in The Literary Souvenir, 1828, with an accompanying poem by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. The 19th-century fashion for \"pictorial\" performances led to directors' drawing on paintings for their inspiration, which, in turn, influenced painters to depict actors and scenes from the theatre.
