George was the heir of King George III of the United Kingdom. After the death of George III in 1820, Prince George became King of the United Kingdom and Hanover, as George IV. Caroline became Queen, but George despised her and sought a divorce by accusing his wife of infidelity. Majocchi appeared as a prosecution witness in her subsequent trial for adultery. Though the foundation of his evidence was held to be true, he was widely suspected of perjury and caricatured.\nMajocchi was hired by Caroline's major-domo, Bartolomeo Pergami, as a manservant in 1815 in Naples. By 1818, he had left her service, and in 1819 he gave evidence to the \"Milan commission\", which had been set up by the Vice-Chancellor John Leach on the instructions of Prince George to gather evidence of Caroline's adultery. George and Caroline had been estranged for many years, and had led separate lives since 1796 but divorce was illegal under English law unless one of the parties could prove adultery.\nBy mid-1820, George had inherited the throne from his father, George III, and he felt he had enough evidence to get the Parliament of the United Kingdom to agree to a divorce between him and Caroline. On 5 July, a bill was introduced into Parliament \"to deprive Her Majesty Queen Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of the Title, Prerogatives, Rights, Privileges, and Exemptions of Queen Consort of this Realm; and to dissolve the Marriage between His Majesty and the said Caroline Amelia Elizabeth.\" The bill charged that Caroline had committed adultery with Bartolomeo Pergami, the head servant of her household, and that consequently she had forfeited her rights to be queen consort. The bill was effectively a public trial of the Queen, whereby the government could call witnesses against Caroline, who would be cross-examined by her legal advisors. By voting on the bill, members of the Houses of Parliament would be both jury and judges.Majocchi was the first witness for the prosecution. The prosecution's reliance on Italian witnesses of low birth led to anti-Italian prejudice in Britain. The witnesses had to be protected from angry mobs, and were depicted in popular prints and pamphlets as venal, corrupt and criminal. Street-sellers sold prints alleging that the Italians had accepted bribes to commit perjury. On 21 August, the day Majocchi's testimony opened, Caroline entered the chamber of the House of Lords. Shortly afterward, Majocchi was called. As he was led in, Caroline rose and advanced towards him, flinging back her veil. She apparently recognised him, exclaimed \"Theodore!\", and rushed out of the House. Her sudden sensational departure was seen as \"burst of agony\" by The Times, but others thought it the mark of a guilty conscience. It led her defence team to advise her against attending in future unless specifically requested.\n\nUnder examination by the Solicitor General for England and Wales John Singleton Copley, Majocchi testified that Caroline and Pergami eat breakfast together, had adjoining bedrooms, and had kissed each other on the lips. He said Pergami's bed was not always slept in, and he had seen Pergami visit the Queen wearing only underwear and a dressing gown. He said that they had slept in the same tent during a trip around the Mediterranean, and that Pergami had attended the Queen, alone, while she was having a bath. The following day, his astonishing testimony continued with the revelation that when Caroline and Pergami were travelling together in a carriage, Pergami kept a bottle with him so he could relieve himself without having to step down from the coach. The situation in the House became more absurd, as the Solicitor General asked Majocchi about a male exotic dancer employed by Caroline, after which Majocchi demonstrated a dance by pulling up his trousers, extending his arms, clicking his fingers, and shouting \"vima dima!\", while moving his body up and down in a suggestive fashion. The Times newspaper was disgusted, and informed its readers that it regretted being \"obliged\" to report \"filth of this kind\". During Majocchi's cross-examination, conducted by Henry Brougham, Majocchi replied \"Non mi ricordo (I don't recall)\" more than 200 times. The phrase was repeated so often, it became a national joke, and featured in cartoons and parodies. Majocchi's credibility as a witness was destroyed. Eventually, the bill failed but Caroline died less than a year later. She was excluded from the coronation, and was never crowned.\nThe examination of Majocchi led to a significant ruling by the Lords on the legal tactic of witness impeachment by use of the witness's prior inconsistent statement which is still studied in classes on the law of evidence to this day. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Caroline of Brunswick", "response": ["George was determined to press ahead with a divorce and set up a commission chaired by the Vice-Chancellor John Leach to gather evidence of Caroline's adultery. Leach sent three commissioners to Milan to interrogate Caroline's former servants, including Theodore Majocchi and Caroline's maid, Louise Demont.Robins, pp. 76\u201377 In London, Brougham was still acting as Caroline's agent. Concerned that the \"Milan commission\" might threaten Caroline, he sent his brother James to Caroline's villa in the hope of establishing whether George had any grounds for divorce. James wrote back to his brother of Caroline and Pergami, \"they are to all appearances man and wife, never was anything so obvious.\"Letter from James Brougham to his brother Henry, quoted in Robins, p. 79 The Milan commission was assembling more and more evidence, and by 1819 Caroline was worried. She informed James Brougham that she would agree to a divorce in exchange for money.Robins, p. 79 However, at this time in England divorce by mutual consent was illegal; it was only possible to divorce if one of the partners admitted or was found guilty of adultery. Caroline said it was \"impossible\" for her to admit that, so the Broughams advised that only formal separation was possible.Robins, p. 80 Both keen to avoid publicity, the Broughams and the Government discussed a deal where Caroline would be called by a lesser title, such as \"Duchess of Cornwall\" rather than \"Princess of Wales\". As the negotiations continued at the end of 1819, Caroline travelled to France, which gave rise to speculation that she was on her way back to England. In January 1820, however, she made plans to return to Italy, but then on 29 January 1820 King George III died. Caroline's husband became king and, at least nominally, she was queen of the United Kingdom.Robins, p. 82", "By the beginning of June 1820, Caroline had travelled north from Italy, and was at St Omer near Calais. Acting on the advice of Alderman Matthew Wood and her lady-in-waiting Lady Anne Hamilton, she rejected the government's offer.Robins, pp. 116\u2013117 She bid farewell to Pergami, and embarked for England. When she arrived on 5 June, riots broke out in support of her.Plowden, p. 269; Robins, pp. 93\u201394 Caroline was a figurehead for the growing Radical movement that demanded political reform and opposed the unpopular king.Robins, pp. 93\u201394 Nevertheless, the king still adamantly desired a divorce, and the following day, he submitted the evidence gathered by the Milan commission to Parliament in two green bags. On 15 June, the guards in the King's Mews mutinied. The mutiny was contained, but the government was fearful of further unrest.Robins, pp. 126\u2013127 Examination of the bags of evidence was delayed as Parliament debated the form of the investigation, but eventually, on 27 June, they were opened and examined in secret by 15 peers. The peers considered the contents scandalous, and a week later, after their report to the House, the government introduced a bill in Parliament, the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820, to strip Caroline of the title of queen and dissolve her marriage.Robins, pp. 132\u2013143 It was claimed that Caroline had committed adultery with a low-born man: Bartolomeo Pergami. Various witnesses, such as Theodore Majocchi, were called during the reading of the bill, which was effectively a public trial of the queen. The trial caused a sensation, as details of Caroline's familiarity with Pergami were revealed. Witnesses said the couple had slept in the same room, kissed, and been seen together in a state of undress.Robins, pp. 193\u2013202 The bill passed the House of Lords, but was not submitted to the House of Commons as there was little prospect that the Commons would pass it. To her friends, Caroline joked that she had indeed committed adultery once\u2014with the husband of Mrs. Fitzherbert, the king.Thomas Moore's Memoirs, (London, 1853) vol. III, p. 149 quoted in Robins, p. 176"]}, {"page": "Pains and Penalties Bill 1820", "response": ["The first witness for the prosecution was an Italian servant, Theodore Majocchi.
