Initially British audiences were shocked by Waters's amplified electric blues, but he was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and receiving rave reviews.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2003), , p. 700. Where British blues had often emulated Delta blues and country blues in the emerging British folk revival, Davies and Korner, who had supported Waters on tour, now began to play high-powered electric blues, forming the band Blues Incorporated.", "A number of solo artists who emerged from the British R&B scene would go on to highly successful careers in the later 1960s and 1970s. These included Long John Baldry, Rod Stewart and Elton John. After the dissolution of Blues Incorporated in 1962 Long John Baldry joined the Cyril Davies R&B All Stars, and after Davies' death in early 1964 took over leadership of the group, renaming it Long John Baldry and His Hoochie Coochie Men. The band featured Rod Stewart as a second vocalist, with whom Baldry formed short lived proto-supergroup Steampacket in 1965. Baldry moved on to front Bluesology, which had originally been formed as an R&B band in 1962 by teenage keyboardist Reggie Dwight, later better known as Elton John. Baldry enjoyed his greatest success with pop ballads, beginning with \"Let the Heartaches Begin\" (1967), which reached number one in Britain, but, despite supporting the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, he remained virtually unknown outside of the UK.R. Unterberger, [ \"Long John Baldry\"], Allmusic. Retrieved 22 July 2010. After Steampacket dissolved in 1966, Rod Stewart joined blues-rock combo Shotgun Express and then the Jeff Beck Group, and when that broke up in 1969 he moved on to the Small Faces, which became the Faces, and also began to pursue his solo career, mixing R&B with rock and folk, to become one of the most successful British solo artists of the 1970s.S. T. Erlewine, [ \"Rod Stewart\"], Allmusic. Retrieved 22 July 2010. Elton John, taking his first name from Bluesology saxophonist Elton Dean and his last from John Baldry, formed a partnership with lyricist Bernie Taupin in 1968 and after writing hits for major pop artists embarked on a solo career that would be the most commercially successful of the early 1970s and one of the most sustained in pop music.S. T. Erlewine, [ \"Elton John\"], Allmusic. Retrieved 22 July 2010."]}, {"page": "Sweet Thursday (album)", "response": ["The album's style mixed typical mid- and late-1960s British rock elements such as R&B, blues, and psychedelia. The piano and organ based arrangements and slightly abstract lyric narratives also showed a pronounced debt to Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde. All but one of the album's songs were written by group members. Allmusic's Bruce Eder views \"Rescue Me\" as one of the better tracks, showing the influence that the group members had had, like many others in the British R&B scene, from playing in Zoot Money's Big Roll Band and the Cyril Davies All-Stars. Eder says that the band's songwriting is largely unmemorable, while Billboard magazine wrote in 1973 that the album \"offers a strong mix of rock, ballads, and folky material, with strong vocals and instrumentals running throughout.\" In 1970, the St. Petersburg Times saw the group as \"smooth\" and the record worthy of inclusion in its \"Unusual Albums\" section."]}, {"page": "The Mustangs", "response": ["As well as their own material, in concert the group often plays some blues standards, though radically reinterpreting the arrangement to suit the band's \"truly storming... ferocious\" sound. These include Lead Belly's \"Hands Off\", Troyce Keane's \"Annie Maybe\" and Cyril Davies \"Countryline Special\". "]}]}}
