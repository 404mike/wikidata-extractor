Reviewing the book, Peter Oborne described West as \"one of the most interesting of the rising generation of political writers, who delights in destroying liberal pieties.\" Oborne also said \"At its worst, though, West's book can come over as an anti-Islamic rant.\" The Observer described the book as a \"brazen and breezily written polemic\" whose \"arguments are repeatedly undermined by reality.\" The Sunday Times included the book in their list of \"Political Books of the Year\". The book's 2015 reissue was chosen as one of The Sunday Times's Political Books of the Year.\nWest's 2020 book Small Men on the Wrong Side of History focuses on the failures of post-war conservativism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mary Kenny", "response": ["Kenny married journalist and writer Richard West in 1974 and the couple raised two children: Patrick and Ed West, both journalists.

Also writing for The Daily Telegraph, Mary Riddell said \"the sink or swim society is upon us, and woe betide the poor, the frail, the old, the sick and the dependent\" whilst Gerald Warner felt that \"of all the Blairesque chimeras pursued by David Cameron, none has more the resonance of a political epitaph than 'Big Society'\". Sir Stephen Bubb, Chief Executive of ACEVO, welcomed the idea of the Big Society but claimed that Cameron was \"undermining\" it. His concerns were about cuts in government money going to charities coming \"too far and too fast\". He later said the project had become a \"wreck\".

In contrast, Ed West, also of The Daily Telegraph, praised the documentary, stating that it was \"atmospheric and intelligent\".

The concessions made to the free market and finance capital, Davis argues, have been antithetical to true small-c conservative values. Ed West elaborates this line of thought more explicitly, noting the negative consequences of the otherwise-noble New Left commitment to the rights of women and sexual and racial minorities. West sees results of this progressivism as including familial breakdown, social fragmentation due to mass immigration, and the elimination of a commitment to socialism."]}, {"page": "Peter Whittle (politician)", "response": ["In 2006 Whittle founded the New Culture Forum (NCF), a think tank whose mission is described as \"challenging the cultural orthodoxies dominant in the media, academia, education, and British culture in its widest sense.\" Speakers at NCF events, including for its annual keynote Smith Lecture, have included Martin Amis, Dame Vivien Westwood, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Nigel Farage, Justin Webb, Sir Anthony Seldon, Petroc Trelawny, Ed Vaizey, Melanie Phillips, Brendan O'Neill and Owen Jones.
