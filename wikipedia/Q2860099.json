He regularly visited Scotland to sketch birds in the wild, his favourite haunt being the Forest of Gaick near Kingussie in Invernesshire. His widely reproduced images of British wildlife, with their evocative and dramatic backgrounds, are enjoyed as much today as they were by naturalists a century ago.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Loon", "response": ["Archibald Thorburn Plate 77.jpg|1918 illustration of a variety of loons by Archibald Thorburn.

His brother Daniel and he were encouraged by a family friend, the philosopher Herbert Spencer, who, like another family friend, Charles Darwin, was an ardent empiricist.  Spencer would take young Richard and Daniel on walks around the family home of Mottisfont Abbey, urging them to observe and enquire on the habits of birds.  Around 1887, they kept a pet sparrowhawk, which was taken to Hyde Park to let it prey on sparrows.  The first serious ornithologist whom Richard met was Brian Hodgson.  Daniel took an interest in bird illustration, which brought them in contact with Archibald Thorburn and led to an introduction to Joseph Wolf and G.E. Lodge.  They had first met Richard Bowdler Sharpe at the Natural History Museum in 1886 and noted that he was very fond of encouraging children, showing them around the bird collections."]}, {"page": "James Fisher (naturalist)", "response": ["*1976 Archibald Thorburn,Thorburn's Birds (Overlook Press) posthumously.

Thorburn recommended Lodge for the commission and in 1913 Lodge began work. He studied bird skin specimens from a number of different collections in Britain including the Natural History Museum and eventually supplied 90 plates to the Wildlife Service of the Department of Internal Affairs of New Zealand. Due to the illness of the author the proposed book was never finished and the plates remained with the Department of Internal Affairs until they were transferred to the Dominion Museum in 1948.
