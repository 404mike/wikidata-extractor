Parker, supported by howitzer boats commanded by Captain John Conn. The darkness of the night and a powerful tide meant that the boats arrived separately rather than together, and Jones' division missed the action completely. The French were well-prepared, and the attackers were met by heavy fire from the ships and from shore. Medusas boats attempted to board a large brig, but they were frustrated by nets stretched around the bulwarks.  Medusa suffered 55 casualties, the most of any ship. Midshipmen William Gore and William Bristow, 14 seamen and 4 marines were killed, and Captain Parker, Lieutenants Charles Pelley and Frederick Langford, the Master William Kirby, Midshipman the Hon. Anthony Maitland, 24 seamen and 6 marines were wounded."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Berwickshire||Anthony Maitland, 10th Earl of Lauderdale||"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Berwickshire||Anthony Maitland, 10th Earl of Lauderdale||"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1826 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Berwickshire||Anthony Maitland, 10th Earl of Lauderdale||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Navy admirals (1707\u2013current)", "response": ["| Anthony Maitland, 10th Earl of Lauderdale KCB KCMG"]}]}}
