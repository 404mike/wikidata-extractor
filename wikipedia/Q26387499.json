His political views were, however, more complex, as between the two elections he had contested at several places, \"professing any political creed that might happen to favour his success\". Indeed, while he contested Canterbury as a Radical at a by-election in 1854, when he contested Beverley again in 1857, he stood as a Conservative despite losing the support of the local party. He then held the seat for just a few months.In August 1857, Glover was unseated after an Election Petition Committee found that he did not meet the required property qualification\u2013owning property worth \u00a3300 a year for a borough seat\u2013at the time of his election, meaning he was not entitled to be elected an MP. However, he had previously declared he met the qualification requirements\u2014these properties he had no interest in.After his case was referred to the Attorney-General, Glover was arrested on 23 December 1857, and he was later found guilty, by the Old Bailey of making a false declaration regarding this qualification. In April 1858, he was sentenced to four months in Newgate Prison, and transferred to the Queen's Bench Prison. The property qualification was later that year abolished.Glover again contested the seat at the 1859 general election, as an independent candidate, but was unsuccessful, ending votes last in the poll.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of UK minor party and independent MPs elected", "response": ["| Edward GloverFollowing the 1857 general election, Glover's election was voided on petition, because he lacked the necessary property qualifications to be a candidate after he was found to have lied about meeting them, and a by-election was held."]}, {"page": "Beverley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Edward GloverGlover's election was declared void on petition, because he lacked the necessary property qualification to be a candidate, and a by-election held || Independent Conservative"]}, {"page": "William Wells (1818\u20131889)", "response": ["He held the seat until his defeat in the 1857 by the Liberal Edward Glover."]}, {"page": "Edward Auchmuty Glover", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Glover (Conservative politician)"]}]}}
