Arranged by former Welsh footballer and Swansea player, Glan Letheren, the trial became a success when Killie manager, Alan Robertson looked to sign DiBisceglie to a multi-year contract. Unfortunately the American was not able to obtain the required UK work-visa before the start of a Scottish Premier League season. But during the pre-season trial, DiBisceglie did get to play centre back for Kilmarnock, subbing on in the 35th minute of a match at Everton F.C. in England on August 6, 2011. On August 11, 2011, DiBisceglie also anchored Killie's back four for the full 90 minutes in their 2\u20130 win over Grange. On August 15, 2011, he travelled with Kilmarnock for a match at Rangers F.C. before having to return to the US.", "On July 4, 2016, DiBisceglie was offered a two-year professional contract from FK V\u00edtkovice of the Czech Republic's National Football League. The team owner's offer was communicated through Glan Letheren and was based on DiBisceglie's CV. The 22-year-old flew to Vitkovice for training the next day. On July 9, 2016, he started and played the full match at centre back in V\u00edtkovice's 2\u20130 win at Sigma Olomouc. After difficult deliberations with Vitkovice manager (Roman West), DiBisceglie chose not to sign the Vitkovice contract in order to pursue other professional opportunities in the United States. Roman West had become the manager of Vitkovice on July 1, 2016, just four days before DiBisceglie arrived. West was sacked 64 days later by the Vitkovice owners on September 4, 2016."]}, {"page": "Glen Letheren", "response": ["#REDIRECT Glan Letheren"]}]}}
