He played in the Football League for York City, Tranmere Rovers and Bradford City.\nHowarth started his career in the youth system of hometown club York City in 1996 while a schoolboy, before becoming a trainee in 1998. He made his first-team debut aged 17, playing in the first six matches of the 1999\u20132000 season. During this run in the team, he signed a professional contract with the club. However, he was unable to play regularly for York because of the form of Bobby Mimms and Alan Fettis. After having trials with Premier League and First Division clubs, Howarth left York in November 2002 to sign for Tranmere Rovers for a five-figure fee. Here, he again played sporadically, only having runs in the team when first-choice goalkeeper John Achterberg was unavailable. After being released by Tranmere in 2005, Howarth signed for Bradford City. However, he was unable to dislodge Donovan Ricketts in goal and was released in 2007. He retired from football and started working as a paramedic.\nWhile at York, Howarth played for England at a number of youth levels. He was capped twice at under-16 level in 1999, while still a trainee at York. He competed with Chelsea's Rhys Evans for a starting place in the under-18 team, playing for them in 2001 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying. After making four under-18 appearances from 2000 to 2001, he progressed to the under-20 team, competing with Evans, Stephen Bywater and Boaz Myhill for a place in the team. He was capped four times for the team from 2001 to 2002 before being given a late call-up to the under-21 squad for the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He was still included in under-21 squads after moving to Tranmere, but failed to be capped at that level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Donovan Ricketts", "response": ["Ricketts never played a game at Bolton and instead moved to Bradford City initially on a year-long loan in July 2004. He spent most of his first season in English football as understudy to Australian Paul Henderson before he finally made his debut in April 2005 and played in the final four games. During the season break he signed permanently on a two-year deal keeping him at City until 2007. He missed nine games because of a broken foot early in the 2005\u201306 season and was replaced by Russell Howarth. He regained his place against Port Vale, before he again missed a game in December 2005 after he was sent off for celebrating a City goal in a game at Southend United. He was immediately recalled to the side following his suspension, and played the following 80 league games, including as ever-present in the 2006\u201307 season."]}, {"page": "Howarth", "response": ["* Russell Howarth (born 1982), English association footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people from York", "response": ["*Russell Howarth (born 1982)"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Russell Howarth||||2005\u20132007||11||0||"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|13||align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Russell Howarth"]}, {"page": "Russ Howarth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Russell Howarth"]}, {"page": "Russell Michael Howarth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Russell Howarth"]}, {"page": "Barlby High School", "response": ["*Russell Howarth, former footballer"]}]}}
