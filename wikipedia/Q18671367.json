Gillray lived with Miss (often called Mrs) Humphrey during the entire period of his fame. It is believed that he several times thought of marrying her, and that on one occasion the pair were on their way to the church, when Gillray said: \"This is a foolish affair, methinks, Miss Humphrey. We live very comfortably together; we had better let well alone.\" There is no evidence, however, to support the stories which scandalmongers invented about their relations. One of Gillray's prints, \"Twopenny Whist\", is a depiction of four individuals playing cards, and the character shown second from the left, an ageing lady with eyeglasses and a bonnet, is widely believed to be an accurate depiction of Miss Humphrey.", "In July 1811 Gillray attempted to kill himself by jumping out of an attic window above Humphrey's shop in St James's Street. Gillray lapsed into insanity and was looked after by Hannah Humphrey until his death on 1 June 1815 in London; he was buried in St James's churchyard, Piccadilly.", "The miscellaneous series of caricatures, although they have scarcely the historical importance of the political series, are more readily intelligible, and are even more amusing. Among the finest are: Shakespeare Sacrificed; Two-Penny Whist (which features an image of Hannah Humphrey); Oh that this too solid flesh would melt; Sandwich-Carrots; The Gout; Comfort to the Corns; Begone Dull Care; The Cow-Pock, which gives humorous expression to the popular dread of vaccination; Dilletanti Theatricals; and Harmony before Matrimony and Matrimonial Harmonics\u2014two exceedingly good sketches in violent contrast to each other.", "In 1851 Henry George Bohn put out an edition, from the original plates in a handsome elephant folio, with coarser sketches\u2014commonly known as the \"Suppressed Plates\"\u2014being published in a separate volume. For this edition Thomas Wright and Robert Harding Evans wrote a commentary, a history of the times embraced by the caricatures. Many copies of the Bohn Edition have been broken up into individual sheets and passed off as originals (see Collecting below). Although the two volumes of the Bohn Edition are often represented as being a complete collection of Gillray's works, this is not the case: for example, Doubl\u00fbres of Characters is not included in either volume. This is most likely because this print was not published by Hannah Humphrey, but by John Wright for the Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine."]}, {"page": "Humphrey", "response": ["*Hannah Humphrey (active 1745\u20131818), British publisher and print seller"]}, {"page": "Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum", "response": ["There is a prefatory essay to each volume by the editor giving a historical synopsis of printmaking, artists, publishers and events through the period covered by the volume; including Rudolph Ackermann, Bowles & Carver, Henry Brookes, Thomas Cornell, Elizabeth Dacheray, Mary Darly, Matthew Darly, John Fairburn, Samuel William Fores, Valentine Green, William Holland, Hannah Humphrey, William Humphrey, Elizabeth Jackson, Eleanor Lay, John Kay, Thomas Maclean, John Raphael Smith, Susan Vivares and many others."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Jackson (publisher)", "response": ["Jackson operated from premises at 14 Marylebone Street, Golden Square between 1783 and 1788.
