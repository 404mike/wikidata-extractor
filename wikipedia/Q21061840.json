When the chapel was transferred to the Presbyterians the Reverend Donald Matheson was appointed minister. He was a bright young thing who, having studied in Germany, where liberal attitudes to Biblical criticism were prevalent, controversially brought in the new translation of the Bible, the Revised Standard Version on its publication in 1881. He was keen on singing and held classes for his congregation as well as sending out postcards with the Sunday hymns on for his flock to practice. Most notably he set up the Granard Debating Society, where a young Ramsay MacDonald opened a debate on socialism. Within the congregation was also the Victorian Liberal and Radical John Bright and a future Lord Chancellor, Douglas Hogg, the first Viscount Hailsham.
