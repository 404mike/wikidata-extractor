He started his professional career with West Bromwich Albion. His early progress led to a proposed transfer to Leeds United in November 1971, but this collapsed when a medical examination discovered a heart condition. Hartford instead moved to Manchester City in 1974. He helped City win the 1976 League Cup Final. After a brief spell with Nottingham Forest, Hartford moved to Everton in 1979 and then had a second spell with Manchester City. After playing for Fort Lauderdale Sun, Hartford joined Norwich City. His shot resulted in the only goal of the 1985 League Cup Final.\nHartford was also a regular in the Scotland national team, earning 50 caps between 1972 and 1982. He was selected for the Scotland squads in the 1978 and 1982 World Cups. Towards the end of his playing career, Hartford became a coach. He was the player/manager of Stockport County and Shrewsbury Town. Since retiring as a player, Hartford has worked in a variety of coaching and scouting roles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stoke City F.C.", "response": ["|  Asa Hartford"]}, {"page": "Macclesfield Town F.C.", "response": ["On 29 June 2007, Ian Brightwell was announced as the new manager, with Asa Hartford as his assistant.

As punishment, Leeds were forced to play their first four home games of the 1971\u201372 season at a neutral venue; they played at Huddersfield's Leeds Road and boasted four wins and two draws from the opening seven matches. Leeds played good football, particularly winning praise for their 7\u20130 and 6\u20131 wins over Southampton and Nottingham Forest respectively, but again could only finish as runners-up after a late collapse and final day defeat at Wolves, allowing Derby County to claim the title by a single point. Revie had attempted to strengthen his squad before the final run-in with a \u00a3177,000 bid for Asa Hartford, but the deal was cancelled by the medical team who spotted a heart defect in the attacker's medical records.

Jordan and the Welsh defender David Jones went to challenge for the ball in the Welsh penalty area, from a throw-in by Scotland midfielder Asa Hartford. The referee decided Jones had handled the ball, and awarded Scotland a penalty, although TV replays later showed that it was in fact Jordan's hand which made contact with the ball (and also that he kissed his hand once the penalty was awarded). The penalty was converted, and the eventual 2\u20130 win for Scotland secured qualification by winning UEFA Group 7. He was selected by Ally MacLeod in the Scotland squad for the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. Jordan scored the opening goal in their first match against Peru, but Scotland went on to lose 3\u20131. Scotland again failed to qualify beyond the group stage, after a 1\u20131 draw with Iran and a 3\u20132 win against the Netherlands.", "Jordan is described by The Herald as having crossed two eras in his career \u2013 having been a Scottish player at the time they were revered in the English game, he has gone on to coach in England as one of seven Scottish managers or coaches in the Premier League. He attributes this to a common determination and desire to win. In contrast to his playing career, Jordan has lamented the state of the game in Scotland in the late 2000s, which has seen a decline in domestic and international Scottish football, and profile of Scottish players in England, and a drying up of opportunities and even the availability of up and coming local players, contrasted to his era with contemporaries like Asa Hartford, Kenny Dalglish and Danny McGrain."]}]}}
