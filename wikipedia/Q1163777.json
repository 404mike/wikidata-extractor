He was arrested and served time in Indian prison for the 1994 kidnappings of Western tourists in India, an act which he acknowledges he was responsible for. He was released in 1999 and provided safe passage into Afghanistan with the support of Taliban in exchange for passengers aboard hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814. He is most well known for his role in the 2002 kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. Saeed was arrested by Pakistani police on 12 February 2002, in Lahore, in connection with the Pearl kidnapping and was sentenced to death on 15 July 2002 by special judge of anti terrorism court Syed Ali Ashraf Shah for killing Pearl. Sheikh's murder conviction was overturned by a Pakistani Court on 2 April 2020.Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, in his book In the Line of Fire, stated that Saeed was originally recruited by British intelligence agency MI6 while studying at the London School of Economics. He alleges Saeed was sent to the Balkans by MI6 to engage in operations. Musharraf later says, \"At some point, he probably became a rogue or double agent\".His complicity in the murder and the reasons behind it have never been in dispute. At his initial court appearance, he stated, \"I don't want to defend this case. I did this ... Right or wrong, I had my reasons. I think that our country shouldn't be catering to America's needs\", but he subsequently appealed his conviction and is awaiting further progress while in prison.
