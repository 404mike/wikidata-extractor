The death of Roger II presented Manuel with an opportunity he could not afford to let by, argues Professor Paul Magdalino. The Kingdom of Sicily had been recognised by Innocent II in 1143, notes the Italianist Graham Loud, but \"relations with the Papacy remained fraught\". The previous King of Sicily, Roger II, had ruled his kingdom with an iron fist, and his nobility chafed, particularly the large number he had effectively dispossessed. His son was less interested than his father in the minutiae of government, and when Roger died in 1154 they took advantage of the new king and rebelled. This was of interest to the Papacy as the rebels were willing to ally themselves with anyone for their purpose."]}, {"page": "Index of Byzantine Empire\u2013related articles", "response": ["* Paul Magdalino"]}, {"page": "Treaty of Devol", "response": ["The terms of the Treaty have been interpreted in various ways.

This process profoundly transformed the very nature of Byzantine aristocracy, with the imposition of an entire class of imperial relatives and associates superimposed on the \"traditional\" administrative system and the higher officialdom that constituted the Senate. In the words of historian Paul Magdalino, this move further isolated the imperial family from the common people and made them \"partners in, rather than executives of, imperial authority\". In this context, the scholar L. Stiernon calculated that in the period from the late 11th to the end of the 12th century, 30% of all sebastoi belonged to the ruling Komnenos family, 20% to the closely allied Doukai, and another 20% to other families of the high aristocracy who intermarried with the Komnenoi, the remaining 10% encompassing both Byzantines as well as foreigners who either intermarried with the imperial family or received the title as an honorific distinction."]}, {"page": "Komnenian restoration", "response": ["Though Manuel was the youngest of John's four sons he was chosen to succeed his father due to his ability to listen to advice and learn from his mistakes (or so his father discerned).

Historian Paul Magdalino explains this process in his book The empire of Manuel Komnenos by placing it in the context of the Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine empire as a whole; he points out that while John's father Alexios had fortified places on the coast, John now expanded Byzantine control into the interior by fortifying places such as Lopadion, Achyraous and Laodicea, which guarded the approaches to the valleys and coastlands of Asia Minor. This restoration of order under John enabled agricultural prosperity to begin a recovery that would eventually restore these war torn regions to their former status as a productive and valuable part of the Byzantine empire.Magdalino, Paul, The empire of Manuel I Komnenos 1143\u20131180", "Manuel campaigned aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east; facing Muslims in Palestine, he allied himself with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and sent a large fleet to participate in a combined invasion of Fatimid Egypt. In an effort to restore Byzantine control over the ports of southern Italy, he sent an expedition to invade Italy in 1155. Operating as part of a coalition of Byzantine, rebel, and Papal forces, Manuel's armies achieved initial success. However, disputes within the coalition led to the expedition's eventual failure. Despite this military setback Manuel was undeterred, and his armies successfully invaded the Kingdom of Hungary in 1167, defeating the Hungarians at the Battle of Sirmium. He was highly successful in the Balkans and Hungary; historian Paul Magdalino argues that no emperor had dominated the region so effectively since Late Antiquity.", "Manuel's programme of fortification in Byzantine Asia, for which he was praised by Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates, is largely regarded as an important success. Manuel demanded tribute from the Turkmen of the Anatolian interior for the winter pasture in Imperial territory; he also improved the defenses of many cities and towns, and established new garrisons and fortresses across the region. As a result of the cumulative efforts of all three Komnenian emperors, Manuel's domination of Asia Minor was more effective than that of any emperor since before Manzikert. As historian Paul Magdalino makes clear, \"by the end of Manuel's reign, the Byzantines controlled all the rich agricultural lowlands of the peninsula, leaving only the less hospitable mountain and plateau areas to the Turks.\"", "*Paul Magdalino, The Empire of Manuel Komnenos, 1143-1180"]}, {"page": "Cosmas I of Constantinople", "response": ["*Paul Magdalino.

In response, Manuel I prepared a major counter-attack in 1167, appointing Andronikos, who months before had been named megas doux, commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy, as the leader of the campaign, although he also gave him detailed instructions for the campaign. The Hungarian army, commanded by the palatine Denis, met the Byzantine army near Zemun on the feast day of St. Procopius, 8 July 1167. As the battle was about to begin, according to Niketas Choniates Andronikos received a message from Manuel, who forbade the battle to take place on that day due to unfavourable astrological omens. Andronikos ignored the order and kept it secret from his officers. The ensuing Battle of Sirmium resulted in \"the most spectacular military victory [...] during Manuel's reign\" (Paul Magdalino), thanks in large part to the crucial intervention of the reserves under Andronikos himself."]}, {"page": "Thessaloniki International Fair", "response": ["Similar trade fairs of the city have occurred regularly since the Byzantine era, attracting traders from all over the Balkans.Paul Magdalino, The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos, 143\u2013144"]}]}}
