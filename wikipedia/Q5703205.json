Her father refused to accept that her death was an accident, and alleged that there was a conspiracy to conceal the truth. \nMr Smith's campaign led to changes in the rules concerning inquests to violent deaths of UK citizens occurring outside the country. Helen Smith's body was stored for thirty years before being buried in 2009. The official version of her death was never disproved.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Helen Smith", "response": ["Helen Smith may refer to:", "*Helen Smith (academic), scholar of English literature", "*Helen Smith (baseball) (1922\u20132019), All-American Girls Professional Baseball League player", "*Helen Smith (fencer) (born 1953), Australian Olympic fencer", "*Helen Smith (nurse) (1956\u20131979), died in suspicious circumstances in Saudi Arabia", "*Helen Smith (psychologist), American forensic psychologist", "*Helen Smith (politician) (1927\u20132007), New Zealand politician in the Values Party", "*Helen Smith (writer) (born 1968), English novelist and dramatist", "* Helen Smith, a character in the television series Moonbase 3", "*Baby Bunny Smith (1888\u20131951), sideshow performer born as Helen Smith"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Robertson", "response": ["Among these, Robertson was involved in the defence of Michael X in Trinidad and has appeared for the defence in a libel case against the former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.
