She studied at the Slade School of Art and worked at the Sadlers Wells Ballet and later attended the stage design course at the Slade run by Vladimir Polunin. In 1950 she married the artist Richard Carline, which placed her at the centre of an artistic circle centred on the Carline family in Hampstead.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2004 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 18 October \u2013 Nancy Carline, artist (born 1909)"]}, {"page": "Slade School of Fine Art", "response": ["* Nancy Carline (1909\u20132004), artist"]}, {"page": "1909 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 30 November \u2013 Nancy Carline, artist (died 2004) "]}, {"page": "List of 20th-century women artists", "response": ["*Nancy Carline (1909\u20132004), painter"]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"C\"", "response": ["*Nancy Carline (1909\u20132004), English painter and sculptor"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2004", "response": ["*Nancy Carline, 94, British artist."]}, {"page": "Carline", "response": ["*Nancy Carline (1909-2004), English painter"]}, {"page": "Hilda Carline", "response": ["They had two daughters, Shirin (born 1925) and Unity (born 1930). While the girls were young Carline was unable to paint much, needing to tend to them and household duties. Her self-confidence waned during her marriage to Spencer. He was a man of \"idiosyncratic vision, unassailable conviction, egocentricity, and brilliance.\" They could both be stubborn and argumentative. Richard Carline's wife, the artist Nancy Carline, contended that Spencer was frustrated by Hilda's lack of time to devote to paintings and housekeeping, and felt the time she spent gardening and sewing was unnecessary.", "From 1932 the Carline-Spencers became increasingly independent of each other, and Spencer began painting and drawing Preece. Although he faltered on his obligations to provide support for Hilda and the girls, Spencer bought Preece gifts, including jewellery. By the mid-1930s the couple were living apart, their daughter Shirin was sent to live with a relative, and two of her brothers had died. Throughout the emotional crisis, her sister-in-law, Nancy Carline (wife of Richard) said that painting was therapeutic for her. One of the works, Lady in Green, was made of Preece, and she travelled to Cookham to make the painting. Carline and Spencer were divorced in May 1937, and Preece and Spencer were married the next week. The marriage was not consummated, they never lived together and Preece had him evicted from the house in 1938 after he had signed over his financial business and house to her. Spencer then lived in Hampstead in a single room. From 1937 on Carline and the girls lived with family members including her mother that year. Subsequently there began a decline in Carline's mental health."]}, {"page": "List of English women artists", "response": ["*Nancy Carline (1909\u20132004), landscape painter"]}]}}
