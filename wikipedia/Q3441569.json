After ending the Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla federation in 1967, he served as the island territory's first Chief Minister from 10 February 1976 to 1 February 1977 and again from May 1980 to 12 March 1984.\nWebster was one of 8 children to survive infancy, out a family total of 16 children. He worked in a dairy farm-factory on Saint Martin for 27 years.  The owner and wife treated him as a son and left Webster with their entire estate, a small fortune.  Webster returned to Anguilla in 1960 to find the island without electricity, paved streets or telephones.Prior to serving as Chief Minister, Webster was designated Chairman of the Anguilla Island Council when the territory declared its independence from the Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla government in 1967, through the Anguillan Revolution which he led. Anguillans forced the Saint Kitts officials and police off of the island, due to alleged mistreatment of the public and governmental misuse of funds (as an example, Anguilla received financial assistance from Canada to build a pier on the island; the money was sent to the central government on Saint Kitts, and a pier was built - on Saint Kitts). \nIn a referendum held on 11 July the inhabitants of Anguilla voted overwhelmingly to secede from the Associated State and to become a separate colony of Britain. Britain sent an advisor, Tony Lee, to exercise an \"interim basic administrative authority\" in conjunction with Ronald Webster, from January 1968 to January 1969; St. Kitts refused to extend the interim agreement and the British authorities left. In February 1969 islanders voted again to remain separate from Saint Kitts and Nevis and to become an \"independent republic\" with Webster leading the council.\nBritish Junior Minister William Whitlock from the United Kingdom arrived in March 1969 to establish another \"interim agreement\", and was expelled within hours of arrival. Eight days later 315 British paratroopers and two frigates arrived to \"restore order\". Tony Lee was installed as a Commissioner for local administration.  Webster left the island.\nAn interim agreement in 1971 was followed by a new constitution in 1976 with Webster becoming the first Chief Minister after his People's Progressive Party won the 1976 election; following a no-confidence vote supported by his fellow ministers, he was removed in 1977. In 1980 Anguilla was formally separated from Saint Kitts and Nevis and became a British colony again, with Webster returning as Chief Minister when his Anguilla United Movement won the 1980 election.  Another ministerial split led to the 1981 election won by Webster's Anguilla People's Party and he stayed in power until losing the 1984 election; his Anguilla United Party also lost in 1989 election.He wrote his \"Farewell Letter\" which is a motivating story of his life and times. This letter was read at his grave by his wife. English and translated version (Hindi) was published in the most read newspaper of Anguilla, The Anguillian.Webster's birthday, 2 March, has been celebrated as a public holiday in Anguilla since its proclamation in 2010.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anguilla", "response": ["Full adult suffrage was introduced to Anguilla in 1952. After a brief period as part of the West Indies Federation (1958\u201362), the island of Anguilla became part of the associated state of Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla with full internal autonomy in 1967. However many Anguillans had no wish to be a part of this union, and resented the dominance of St Kitts within it. On 30 May 1967 Anguillans forcibly ejected the St Kitts police force from the island and declared their separation from St Kitts following a referendum.Anguilla, 11 July 1967: Separation from St Kitts and Nevis; Peace Committee as Government Direct Democracy David X.

Efforts by British envoy William Whitlock failed to break the impasse and 300 British troops were subsequently sent in March 1969. British authority was restored, and confirmed by the Anguilla Act of July 1971. In 1980, Anguilla was finally allowed to formally secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis and become a separate British Crown colony (now a British overseas territory). Since then, Anguilla has been politically stable, and has seen a large growth in its tourism and offshore financing sectors."]}, {"page": "History of Anguilla", "response": ["with Ronald Webster.
