This annual was a new concept it combined some aspects that had been seen in England with new ideas Ackermann had brought from Germany. The idea of an \"annual\" was new and was aimed primarily at women readers and exploited the lowering cost of publishing. A marked difference was that Ackermann was willing to commission engravings and then request a story or poem to accompany it. This was a major difference from previously when the writers saw themselves as leading the imaginative process.Scott, Hogg, and the Gift-Book Editors: Authorship in the Face of Industrial Production, Richard J.
