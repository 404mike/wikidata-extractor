He is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper who occasionally bowls right arm medium-fast. He played for Lancashire from 2005 until his release in 2013, and the following year signed for Derbyshire. In 2015 he returned to Clifton as professional having earlier come through their junior ranks.\nCross briefly started his cricket at Roe Green Cricket Club in Worsley, before moving to Clifton Salford. Cross made his first-class debut in 2005. Lancashire's stalwart wicketkeeper Warren Hegg retired at the end of the season, and the signing of Luke Sutton in the off-season limited Cross' first-team opportunities. Despite the competition he established himself as a regular in the one-day side, although he struggled to break into the County Championship team.\nIn 2009 Cross captained the Second XI, leading them to the semi-final of the Second XI Trophy. Sutton left in late 2010, leaving Cross as Lancashire's first-choice wicketkeeper. He was part of the Lancashire squad that won the 2011 County Championship and achieved the rare feat of being ever-present in a championship winning side, but left the club at the end of the 2013 season and after a short time with Cheshire in early 2014 signed to play for Derbyshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clifton Cricket Club", "response": ["Clifton's current Captain is former Lancashire and Derbyshire all rounder and wicketkeeper Gareth Cross."]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["*  Gareth Cross"]}, {"page": "Victorian Premier Cricket", "response": ["| Gareth Cross"]}, {"page": "2008 Twenty20 Cup knockout stage", "response": ["Lancashire's reply got off to a similar start to the Middlesex innings, with both openers Gareth Cross and Lou Vincent going cheaply. The third wicket of Stuart Law, fell with only fourteen runs on the scoreboard, and it looked ominous for the Lightning. Flintoff then stepped up, and hit a 41-ball 53, but when he fell to Steven Finn, it looked as if the game was up. Steady knocks from Kyle Hogg and Glen Chapple left the Lightning with eighteen to win, off the final six balls. However, Middlesex held out for victory, and progress to the second semi-final on Finals Day."]}, {"page": "List of Lancashire Cricket Board List A players", "response": ["*Gareth Cross (2002): GD Cross"]}]}}
