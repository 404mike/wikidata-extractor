He featured regularly in the U's reserves but was unable to force his way into the first-team picture, with the club already possessing a number of attacking players, including Tony Adcock, Keith Bowen, Perry Groves and Ian Allinson. He went on to eventually make his debut on 3 September 1983 in a 2\u20131 win at Layer Road over Blackpool, coming on as a substitute for Groves. He made three league appearances for the club, all from the substitutes bench. He played his last game for the club on 21 February 1984 in a 2\u20131 Associate Members Cup win against Wimbledon, on this occasion coming on for Les Mutrie."]}, {"page": "Mutrie", "response": ["* Les Mutrie (1951\u20132017), English footballer "]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1980s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Les Mutrie"]}, {"page": "2017 in association football", "response": ["* 3 October: Les Mutrie, English footballer (born 1951)"]}, {"page": "2017 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Les Mutrie, 66, footballer (Hull City)."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 in English football", "response": ["* 3 October 2017: Les Mutrie, 66, Carlisle United, Hull City, Colchester United and Hartlepool United striker."]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2017", "response": ["*Les Mutrie, 66, English footballer (Hull City), cancer.Former Hull City forward Les Mutrie loses cancer battle"]}]}}
