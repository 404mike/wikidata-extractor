After completing this course with Honours, he was immediately offered a place as a part-time adult education lecturer, an occupation he found extremely rewarding. By this time he was also working on the extensive manuscript journals of the 18th-century English amateur composer, John Marsh, an undertaking that ultimately resulted in his edited version being published in the United States in 1998.  His most recent book is a study of catch and glee culture in 18th-century England. He has also written chapters for two anthologies, essays for scholarly journals and presented papers at academic conferences, in addition to contributing entries in the revised New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography."]}, {"page": "List of symphonies in G major", "response": ["|John Marsh"]}, {"page": "List of symphonies in E-flat major", "response": ["|John Marsh"]}, {"page": "Charles Harward", "response": ["One of Chichester's residents, at the time of Harward, was John Marsh a gentleman, composer, diarist and writer.Brandon Sussex p. 224 He recorded some pretty uncomplimentary details about Harward in his diary suggesting that 'Dean Howard was as little of a gentleman as he was a divine'.Marsh.
