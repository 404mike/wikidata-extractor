Many garments were given away to celebrities or just disappeared from the shop. By 1967, Quorum, the partnership between Alice Pollock and Ossie, was deeply in debt and Alice's financial backer, Mike Armitage, a stockbroker, decided there was little possibility of Quorum ever making a profit and he and Alice agreed to sell Quorum to a large UK fashion house, Radley (run by Alfred Radley). Radley took over Quorum's debts and put the management onto a sound basis. Alfred Radley was keen to maintain what made Ossie special and so he continued to support Ossie's aspirations by developing the Ossie Clark brand and funding large annual fashion shows, expanding Quorum's retail business and distributing Ossie's dresses to leading retailers around the world through the introduction of the \"Ossie Clark for Radley\" collections."]}, {"page": "Radley (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Alfred Radley (1924\u20132019), British clothing manufacturer"]}, {"page": "Sheridan Barnett", "response": ["Sheridan Barnett was born in Bradford in 1951 and moved to London to study art at Hornsey College of Art and then Chelsea College of Art, completing his studies in 1973.
