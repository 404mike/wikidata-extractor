His team started the 2009\u201310 season by going four games without scoring, until they recorded a 5\u20134 victory against Cheltenham Town. After the game, McCall said: \"That was the youngest, and certainly cheapest, team Bradford have put out for a long time and I'm really proud of them.\" City continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached the area semi-finals of the Football League Trophy where they lost to Carlisle United, managed by McCall's friend Greg Abbott, but at the start of 2010 found themselves 16th in League Two and eight points off the play-offs after a run of five defeats in seven games. McCall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games, saying: \"The bottom line is that the players and me personally will get judged on results. And the results aren't good enough.\" Despite the club's slide down the table, he denied he would resign, but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing Gareth Evans to give City a late 2\u20131 away at Torquay United saved McCall from being sacked. However, defeat to Bury in the club's following fixture was McCall's last game as manager, with McCall saying after the game: \"It's time for somebody else to come in and take up the reins and hopefully do well.\" He won a little more than one-third of his 133\u00a0games in charge of City.

He scored his first goal of the season in the game to give City a 2\u20130 lead, but his side conceded twice for the game to finish in a 2\u20132 draw. He scored in the club's following two games, but was then kept out of the side for two weeks by a virus. Upon his return, he scored his 100th\u00a0career goal and his fourth goal in five games as a late consolation in an FA Cup defeat to Notts County. However, Boulding continued to struggle to maintain a first-team place and was released early from his contract in March 2010, along with his brother under mutual consent, after failing to make a single start under new manager Peter Taylor. He had played 71 games at City, although nearly one-third were as substitute, and scored 19 goals."]}, {"page": "Steven Schumacher", "response": ["At the start of the 2014\u201315 season, Schumacher managed to regain his first team place, playing in the midfield position.

Schumacher then provided assist from a corner to lead to Stephen Jordan in early minutes in a 3\u20132 loss against Preston North End on 25 October 2014.

He had only came to the club's attention when Musselwhite spotted on television that he had been released by Port Vale. Anyon replaced the popular Rob Burch, who had signed with Notts County. He started well at his new club, putting in some match winning performances. He made a costly error during a heavy home defeat to Bury on 23 November, but four days later put in a 'heroic' display against Hereford United to keep the club in the FA Cup. On 17 January he made another 'howler' in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. Lincoln bottom of the Football League, new manager Steve Tilson signed Trevor Carson on loan from Sunderland, who immediately took Anyon's place in goal. In March 2011, Anyon joined fellow League Two side Morecambe on an emergency loan, following an injury to Barry Roche, who was Sammy McIlroy's regular custodian. He made a costly error in his first game for the club, gifting Bury a 1\u20130 win on 8 March. He recovered five days later to save a Gareth Evans penalty, and was praised for his overall performance in the 1\u20130 defeat to Bradford City at the Globe Arena. After two further appearances he returned to Sincil Bank, where he faced a new rival in Aston Villa loanee Elliot Parish.

Macclesfield equalised just four minutes later after Matt Hamshaw's cross was headed in by Nat Brown. Tyrone Barnett then put the away side ahead early in the second\u2013half. Stevenage levelled the game with just one minute remaining after Rob Sinclair cut in from the right and slid the ball to Charlie Griffin, who poked the ball past the on\u2013rushing Veiga. The club's first away game in the Football League ended in a 1\u20130 defeat against Bradford City at Valley Parade. Bradford striker Gareth Evans scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot in the first\u2013half in a game that was \"rough luck on the visitors\" having dominated large parts of the game. Stevenage won their first game of the season a week later, beating Stockport County 3\u20131 at Broadhall Way. Charlie Griffin opened the scoring with a looping header after half an hour, before Michael Bostwick's 30-yard effort found the top corner two minutes before the interval. Griffin added the third with a close range effort in the second-half, with Stockport's George Donnelly scoring a consolation goal in injury\u2013time. A week later, Stevenage travelled to Aldershot Town for their second away fixture of the season. The game ended all square, finishing 1\u20131. Chris Beardsley opened the scoring five minutes into the second-half, with Aldershot striker Damian Spencer equalising fifteen minutes later. With just five minutes remaining, Jon Ashton was adjudged to have fouled Spencer in the area, with referee Mark Halsey pointing to the spot.
