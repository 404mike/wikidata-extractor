Five years in the wartime Army gave him little scope for music-making but Butterfield more than made up for it afterwards. In 1939, however, he won the Alexander Owen Scholarship for young brass players and had his first work played in public by the Wingates Band conducted by Granville Bantock. Butterworth had no idea at the time how famous Bantock was, nor that he was a friend of Sibelius whom he revered! Nevertheless, the great man said kindly \u201cIf you try hard enough, maybe one day you\u2019ll grow up to be a proper composer.\u201d At the Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern College of Music), Butterworth studied composition with Richard Hall and also learned the trumpet and conducting. He studied composition with Ralph Vaughan Williams after writing to the composer in 1950, requesting lessons.
