The first time was for three games between the departure of Dave Mackay and the arrival of Lou Macari in early 1991; Birmingham remained unbeaten under his management.\nAfter Macari walked out in June 1991 to join Stoke City, Coldwell again took over as caretaker, this time persuading a significant number of out-of-contract players to re-sign (and not leave the club with Macari),\nand supervising pre-season training until the appointment of Terry Cooper in August 1991.In April 1993 he replaced Len Ashurst as manager of Southern League Weymouth. Unable to prevent relegation to the Southern Division, he stabilised the club and achieved a mid-table finish with a young side in the 1992\u201393 season, but was sacked in September 1993.Coldwell died in Bristol at the age of 63.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Weymouth F.C.", "response": ["*  Bill Coldwell (April 1993 \u2013 Sept 1994)"]}, {"page": "Coldwell", "response": ["* Bill Coldwell (1932\u20131995), English football manager and scout"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["After Lou Macari had quit as manager at the end of the 1990\u201391 season, and caretaker Bill Coldwell had persuaded all the out-of-contract players apart from Vince Overson to renew, Terry Cooper was appointed manager in August, only a week before the playing season started.Matthews (1995), p. 48."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Bill Coldwell, football manager, was born in Petersfield"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Bill Coldwell (1954\u20131955) : W.
