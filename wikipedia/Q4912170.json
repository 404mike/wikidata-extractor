Whilst serving in 1997, he lost his sight after contracting a rare disease which destroyed both of his optic nerves.\nOn 2 August 2003, he set the blind solo world land speed record on a motorbike with a speed of 164.87 mph (265.33 km/h). On 17 August 2013 Baxter lost his record to Stuart Gunn of Edinburgh, who managed a speed of 167.1 mph (268.92 km/h) at Elvington air strip.In 2004, he was a guest on the BBC television programme Top Gear and drove a lap of their circuit as the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\", credited as the \"Blind Man\". He was guided around the circuit by the host, Jeremy Clarkson, and his official lap time was 2:02 minutes, which is faster than two of the fully sighted contestants (Terry Wogan and Richard Whiteley). Ex-Stig Ben Collins however stated in his autobiography that during practice sessions Baxter completed the lap in a time of 1 minute and 58 seconds.\nFor the past few years, Baxter has been involved with various blind charities as a public speaker, educating groups of all ages about being blind as well as discussing his life experiences so far. He is currently enjoying life with full intensity, taking part in motorcycle riding, PSHE, learning to ski, and is now enjoying amateur dramatics.\nIn 2007 he completed a Blind Solo Lap of Donington Park. \"My biggest challenge yet, I rode my Ducati Monster around the hallowed circuit of Donington, the home of motorcycle racing, raising awareness for Vista, a charity helping blind people in the Midlands, an amazing experience and great fun.\"\nBaxter was appointed the official Town Crier of Llandudno, North Wales by Llandudno Town Council in 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Baxter (name)", "response": ["* Billy Baxter (footballer), Scottish footballer", "* Billy Baxter (motorcyclist), British soldier", "* Billy Baxter (musician), born ca. 1959, an Australian vocalist and later a comedian on Coodabeen Champions", "* Billy Baxter (poker player), American poker player"]}, {"page": "Blind Veterans UK", "response": ["The charity also has a sporting reputation, organising blind sports like goalball as well as conventional sports such as shooting, archery and rock-climbing. Two representatives of Blind Veterans UK, Tony Parkinson and Ray Peart, participated in the 1976 Toronto Paralympics. Some Blind Veterans UK representatives have participated in extreme sports, including Billy Baxter, who holds the world record for fastest blind motorcyclist."]}, {"page": "Top Gear test track", "response": ["The two slowest laps on the Liana celebrity list are held by Terry Wogan and Richard Whiteley, both of whom were beaten by Billy Baxter, a blind Bosnian war veteran. He guided the Liana through the track under direction from Clarkson in the passenger seat in a time of 2 minutes 2 seconds, which was 1.4 seconds quicker than Terry Wogan, and 4 seconds faster than Richard Whiteley.", "For some of the laps more than one person has been present in the car. This was the case for Clarkson's run when he had both Hammond and Jason Dawe in the car. Trinny and Susannah were both in the car for each other's runs. Denise Van Outen was in the car when Johnny Vaughan did his lap; Van Outen never did a lap driving the car. Clarkson was also present as a navigator for Billy Baxter's laps."]}, {"page": "Billy Baxter", "response": ["Billy Baxter may refer to:", "*Billy Baxter (motorcyclist) (born  1963), British motorcyclist who set the blind solo world land speed record on a motorbike", "*Billy Baxter (footballer) (1939\u20132009),  Scottish footballer", "*Billy Baxter (poker player) (born 1940), American poker player and sports bettor", "*Billy Baxter (musician) (born c. 1959), Australian radio presenter and musician", "**\"Billy Baxter\" (song), a 1980 song by Paul Kelly & the Dots describing the musician"]}]}}
