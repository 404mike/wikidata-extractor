He made his debut for the club against Boreham Wood in their 6\u20131 defeat in January 2006, his only appearance for the club. He progressed through the Dagenham & Redbridge reserve team and earned a two-year contract with the club. In November 2008, Charge joined Hitchin Town on loan. He made his debut for Hitchin Town in the club's 1\u20130 home loss to Halesowen Town. Three days later, Charge scored twice in Hitchin's 4\u20130 victory against Arlesey Town. He played a total of four league games for Hitchin, before returning to his parent club after Hitchin's 3\u20132 loss to Cheshunt in the Herts Senior Cup in December 2008. Charge returned to Dagenham, and made his first-team debut after coming on as an 84th minute substitute in a 3\u20130 victory over Notts County in April 2009. He had his contract cancelled by mutual consent in August, as he \"decided the time is right to seek a new Club\". Shortly after his release from Dagenham, Charge signed for Conference National club Grays Athletic. He scored his first professional goal for Grays Athletic in the club's 3\u20131 home defeat to Kidderminster Harriers a week after signing for the club. A week later, Charge scored his second goal for Grays in a 4\u20132 home defeat to AFC Wimbledon, converting Glenn Poole's cross to temporarily restore parity just after half-time. In September 2009, he scored, this time scoring from close range in Grays' 2\u20130 victory against Cambridge United.
