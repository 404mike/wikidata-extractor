He is now considered one of the greatest critics and essayists in the history of the English language, placed in the company of Samuel Johnson and George Orwell. He is also acknowledged as the finest art critic of his age. Despite his high standing among historians of literature and art, his work is currently little read and mostly out of print.During his lifetime he befriended many people who are now part of the 19th-century literary canon, including Charles and Mary Lamb, Stendhal, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, and John Keats.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Autobiography", "response": ["Following the trend of Romanticism, which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Confessions, a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. Stendhal's autobiographical writings of the 1830s, The Life of Henry Brulard and Memoirs of an Egotist, are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau. An English example is William Hazlitt's Liber Amoris (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life."]}, {"page": "April 10", "response": ["*1778 \u2013 William Hazlitt, English essayist and critic (d. 1830)"]}, {"page": "Edmund Burke", "response": ["In the 19th century, Burke was praised by both liberals and conservatives. Burke's friend Philip Francis wrote that Burke \"was a man who truly & prophetically foresaw all the consequences which would rise from the adoption of the French principles\", but because Burke wrote with so much passion, people were doubtful of his arguments.Gregory Claeys, 'The Reflections refracted: the critical reception of Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France during the early 1790s', in John Whale (ed.), Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France. New interdisciplinary essays (Manchester University Press, 2000), p. 55, n. 23. William Windham spoke from the same bench in the House of Commons as Burke had when he had separated from Fox and an observer said Windham spoke \"like the ghost of Burke\" when he made a speech against peace with France in 1801.A. D. Harvey, Britain in the early nineteenth century (B T Batsford Ltd, 1978), p. 125. William Hazlitt, a political opponent of Burke, regarded him as amongst his three favourite writers (the others being Junius and Rousseau) and made it \"a test of the sense and candour of any one belonging to the opposite party, whether he allowed Burke to be a great man\".Lock, Burke's Reflections, p. 175. William Wordsworth was originally a supporter of the French Revolution and attacked Burke in A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff (1793), but by the early 19th century he had changed his mind and came to admire Burke. In his Two Addresses to the Freeholders of Westmorland, Wordsworth called Burke \"the most sagacious Politician of his age\", whose predictions \"time has verified\".Lock, Burke's Reflections, p. 173. He later revised his poem The Prelude to include praise of Burke (\"Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced/By specious wonders\") and portrayed him as an old oak. Samuel Taylor Coleridge came to have a similar conversion as he had criticised Burke in The Watchman, but in his Friend (1809\u20131810) had defended Burke from charges of inconsistency.Lock, Burke's Reflections, pp. 173\u201374. Later in his Biographia Literaria (1817), Coleridge hails Burke as a prophet and praises Burke for referring \"habitually to principles. He was a scientific statesman; and therefore a seer\".Lock, Burke's Reflections, p. 174. Henry Brougham wrote of Burke that \"all his predictions, save one momentary expression, had been more than fulfilled: anarchy and bloodshed had borne sway in France; conquest and convulsion had desolated Europe. [\u2026] [T]he providence of mortals is not often able to penetrate so far as this into futurity\".Claeys, p. 50. George Canning believed that Burke's Reflections \"has been justified by the course of subsequent events; and almost every prophecy has been strictly fulfilled\". In 1823, Canning wrote that he took Burke's \"last works and words [as] the manual of my politics\".E. J. Stapleton (ed.), Some Official Correspondence of George Canning. Volume I (London: Longmans, Green & Co., 1887), p. 74. The Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli \"was deeply penetrated with the spirit and sentiment of Burke's later writings\".William Flavelle Monypenny and George Earle Buckle, The Life of Benjamin Disraeli. Earl of Beaconsfield. Volume I. 1804\u20131859 (London: John Murray, 1929), p. 310."]}, {"page": "Essay", "response": ["In the 18th and 19th centuries, Edmund Burke and Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote essays for the general public. The early 19th century, in particular, saw a proliferation of great essayists in English\u2014William Hazlitt, Charles Lamb, Leigh Hunt and Thomas de Quincey all penned numerous essays on diverse subjects, reviving the earlier graceful style. Later in the century, Robert Louis Stevenson also raised the form's literary level. In the 20th century, a number of essayists, such as T.S. Eliot, tried to explain the new movements in art and culture by using essays. Virginia Woolf, Edmund Wilson, and Charles du Bos wrote literary criticism essays."]}, {"page": "Jacobin (politics)", "response": ["Thomas Paine was a believer in the French Revolution and supported the Girondins.  At the same time, Protestant Dissenters seeking for relief from the Test and Corporation Acts supported the French Revolution at least in its early stages after seeing concessions to religious minorities by the French authorities in 1787 and in the Declaration of Rights of Man.  Paine's publications enjoyed support by Painite Radical factions like the Manchester Constitutional Society.  Prominent members of the Society who worked for the Radical Manchester Herald newspaper even contacted the Jacobin Club in France in April 13, 1792.  Thus, Radicals were labeled Jacobins by their opponents.  Regional Painite radicalism was incorrectly portrayed as English Jacobinism and were attacked by Conservative forces including Edmund Burke as early as 1791.  The London Revolution Society also corresponded with the National Assembly starting in November 1789.  Their letters were circulated among the regional Jacobin clubs, with around 52 clubs corresponding with the society by the spring of 1792.  Other regional British revolutionary societies formed in centers of British Jacobinism.  English Jacobins included the young Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth and others prior to their disillusionment with the outbreak of the Reign of Terror. Others, such as Paine, William Hazlitt and Whig statesman Charles James Fox, remained idealistic about the Revolution."]}, {"page": "John Keats", "response": ["Despite the bad reviews of Poems, Hunt published the essay \"Three Young Poets\" (Shelley, Keats, and Reynolds) and the sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer,\" foreseeing great things to come.Gittings (1968), p. 155. He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of The Times, Thomas Barnes; the writer Charles Lamb; the conductor Vincent Novello; and the poet John Hamilton Reynolds, who would become a close friend.Motion (1997), pp. 116\u2013120. Keats also met regularly with William Hazlitt, a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed \"a new school of poetry\".Motion (1997) p. 130. At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey, \"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth.\"Keats's letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817 This passage would eventually appear in the concluding lines of \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": Beauty is truth, truth beauty' \u2013 that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\". In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey's fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training, and despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, made large loans to friends such as the painter Benjamin Haydon. He would go on to lend \u00a3700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts.Bate (1964) p. 632."]}, {"page": "Kubla Khan", "response": ["Literary reviews at the time of the collection's first publication generally dismissed it.Ashton 1997 p. 112 At the time of the poem's publication, a new generation of critical magazines, including Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Edinburgh Review, and Quarterly Review, had been established, with critics who were more provocative than those of the previous generation. These critics were hostile to Coleridge due to a difference of political views, and due to a puff piece written by Byron about the Christabel publication.Jackson 1970 pp. 8\u201310 The first of the negative reviews was written by William Hazlitt, literary critic and Romantic writer, who criticized the fragmentary nature of the work. Hazlitt said that the poem \"comes to no conclusion\" and that \"from an excess of capacity, [Coleridge] does little or nothing\" with his material. The only positive quality which Hazlitt notes is a certain aesthetic appeal: he says \"we could repeat these lines to ourselves not the less often for not knowing the meaning of them,\" revealing that \"Mr Coleridge can write better nonsense verse than any man in English.\"William Hazlitt, 2 June 1816 review in the Examiner, Holmes 1998 qtd p. 434 As other reviews continued to be published in 1816, they, too, were lukewarm at best. The poem was not disliked as strongly as Christabel,July 1816 anonymous review in the Anti-Jacobin, qtd. in Jackson p. 221 and one reviewer expressed regret that the poem was incomplete.Jackson 1970 qtd. p. 216 The poem received limited praise for \"some playful thoughts and fanciful imagery,\"William Roberts, August 1816 review in British Review, qtd. in Jackson 1970 p. 225 and was said to \"have much of the Oriental richness and harmony\"July 1816 anonymous review in the Augustan Review, qtd. in Jackson 1995 p. 266 but was generally considered unremarkable, as expressed by one review which said that \"though they are not marked by any striking beauties, they are not wholly discreditable to the author's talents.\""]}, {"page": "Othello", "response": ["There have been many differing views on the character of Othello over the years. A.C. Bradley calls Othello the \"most romantic of all of Shakespeare's heroes\" (by \"hero\" Bradley means protagonist) and \"the greatest poet of them all\". On the other hand, F.R. Leavis describes Othello as \"egotistical\". There are those who also take a less critical approach to the character of Othello such as William Hazlitt, who said: \"the nature of the Moor is noble ... but his blood is of the most inflammable kind\". Conversely, many scholars have seen Iago as the anti-hero of the piece. W. H. Auden, for example, observed that \"any consideration of [the play] must be primarily occupied, not with its official hero, but with its villain\"."]}, {"page": "Psychological egoism", "response": ["Psychological egoism has been accused of being circular: \"If a person willingly performs an act, that means he derives personal enjoyment from it; therefore, people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment.\"  In particular, seemingly altruistic acts must be performed because people derive enjoyment from them and are therefore, in reality, egoistic.  This statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis: it assumes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment, and concludes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment.  This objection was tendered by William HazlittHazlitt (1991). and Thomas Macaulay in the 19th century, and has been restated many times since.  An earlier version of the same objection was made by Joseph Butler in 1726."]}, {"page": "Romanticism", "response": ["In English literature, the key figures of the Romantic movement are considered to be the group of poets including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and the much older William Blake, followed later by the isolated figure of John Clare; also such novelists as Walter Scott from Scotland and Mary Shelley, and the essayists William Hazlitt and Charles Lamb. The publication in 1798 of Lyrical Ballads, with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement. The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native Lake District, or his feelings about nature\u2014which he more fully developed in his long poem The Prelude, never published in his lifetime. The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the Lake Poets were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer William Hazlitt and others."]}, {"page": "September 18", "response": ["*1830 \u2013 William Hazlitt, English philosopher, painter, and critic (b. 1778)"]}, {"page": "Samuel Taylor Coleridge", "response": ["Coleridge also worked briefly in Shropshire, where he came in December 1797 as locum to its local Unitarian minister, Dr Rowe, in their church in the High Street at Shrewsbury.  He is said to have read his Rime of the Ancient Mariner at a literary evening in Mardol.  He was then contemplating a career in the ministry, and gave a probationary sermon in High Street church on Sunday, 14 January 1798. William Hazlitt, a Unitarian minister's son, was in the congregation, having walked from Wem to hear him.  Coleridge later visited Hazlitt and his father at Wem but within a day or two of preaching he received a letter from Josiah Wedgwood II, who had offered to help him out of financial difficulties with an annuity of \u00a3150 (approximately \u00a313,000 in today's money) per year on condition he give up his ministerial career.  Coleridge accepted this, to the disappointment of Hazlitt who hoped to have him as a neighbour in Shropshire."]}, {"page": "1830", "response": ["* September 18 \u2013 William Hazlitt, English essayist (b. 1778)"]}, {"page": "1778", "response": ["** William Hazlitt, English writer (d. 1830)"]}]}}
