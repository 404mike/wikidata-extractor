From 1924 he worked for the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, becoming its director in 1945. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1938, was awarded the Linnean Medal in 1961, and knighted in 1965. The National Marine Biological Library at the Marine Biological Association retains much of Russell's scientific and personal papers for the period 1921-1984.Russell studied the life histories and distribution of plankton. He also discovered a means of distinguishing between different species of fish shortly after they have hatched. He was the author of The Medusae of the British Isles (1953\u20131970). He served in both World Wars, being awarded, among others, the Distinguished Flying Cross.\nHe was the father of W. M. S.

Even though it may have only been called A. forskalea in 1810, it was still discovered in 1775 as Aequorea aequorea. A reputable marine biologist, Frederick Stratten Russell, authored the book The Medusae of the British Isles in 1953 where he stated that A. forskalea was the acceptable name for these species, and that A. aequorea was a name reserved for an unidentifiable species. One notably similar species, A. victoria is found abundantly in the Pacific.
