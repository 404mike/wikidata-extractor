At the start of the 2004\u201305 season, Crewe were rated one of the teams most likely to be relegated from the newly renamed 'Championship'. In the event, they put in a good showing in the first half of the season, but after selling Dean Ashton to Norwich City for \u00a33 million in the January 2005 transfer window, Crewe failed to win until the final match of the season, when they defeated Coventry City 2\u20131 to avoid relegation on goal difference.

Once again Blackwell had convinced in-demand players to join Leeds. Blackwell's shrewd tactics away from Elland Road and attacking style at home (where 9 out of 10 matches were won) proved very effective and, by the end of February, Blackwell had guided Leeds to 3rd spot and an almost guaranteed play off spot, with automatic promotion remaining a possibility. The Leeds team, however, then produced some distinctly average performances and settled for their play-off place."]}, {"page": "David Healy (footballer)", "response": ["Aiming for a move away from Deepdale, Healy got his wish in October 2004, as he was signed by Leeds United for a \u00a3650,000 fee.

He made his return at the end of October and scored his first goal for the club from a free kick in a 3\u20132 defeat away to Blackpool. Under Paul Jewell's management, Commons played predominantly as a wide midfielder but, following Jewell's resignation on 28 December following a 1\u20130 home defeat to Ipswich Town, he was moved into a supporting striker role by caretaker manager David Lowe for the first leg of the 2008\u201309 League Cup Semi-Final against Manchester United. Commons scored the only goal of the game, a 25-yard strike, as Derby ran out surprising 1\u20130 winners and was awarded the Man of the Match Award. Jewell's permanent successor, Nigel Clough, kept Commons in his new role and he played alongside Rob Hulse in Derby's attack for the rest of the season. Commons enjoyed his best form of the season in Clough's first few months in charge, scoring the winner against Coventry City, and netting twice in a 4\u20131 rout of Blackpool. He also scored the winner in a 3\u20132 win over Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup Fourth Round replay, as Derby came from 2\u20130 down to claim a first win at The City Ground for over 30 years. Derby fans named the goal the seventh greatest in the club's history, behind Commons' goal against Manchester United in the League Cup in joint fifth, in a poll as part of the club's 125th Anniversary celebrations.

Commons grabbed his first of the season in the following match, as Derby lost 3\u20132 away to Scunthorpe United. However, once again, injury curtailed Commons productivity as he appeared in just one match between 20 October and 2 January, a 0\u20130 draw away to eventual champions Newcastle United, where he came on as a 69th-minute substitute. An extended run in the first team followed and Commons once again approached his best from and helped revive Derby's stuttering campaign and dragged them away from the relegation zone. The team netted a 3\u20130 home win over Newcastle and a 5\u20133 victory over Preston North End. Common proved the assist for Rob Hulse's winner as Derby beat Nottingham Forest 1\u20130 and ended their rivals' 19 match unbeaten streak. However, an injury sustained in the first half of a 1\u20130 home defeat to Swansea City on 20 February ruled Commons out until the final game of the season, against Cardiff City on 2 May, as Derby avoided relegation for the second time in two seasons.
