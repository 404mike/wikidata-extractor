Typefaces that became popular around this time included original early \"grotesque\" sans-serifs, as well as new and more elegant designs in the same style such as Helvetica and Univers. Mosley has commented that in 1960 \"orders unexpectedly revived\" for the old Monotype Grotesque design: \"[it] represents, even more evocatively than Univers, the fresh revolutionary breeze that began to blow through typography in the early sixties.\" He added in 2007 \"its rather clumsy design seems to have been one of the chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of the\u00a0... prettiness of Gill Sans\". As an example of this trend, Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert's corporate rebranding of BR as British Rail in 1965 introduced Helvetica and Univers for printed matter and the custom but very similar Rail Alphabet for signage, and abandoned the classical, all caps signage style with which Gill Sans is often associated. Kinneir and Calvert's road signage redesign used a similar approach. Linotype and its designer Hermann Zapf, who had begun development on a planned Gill Sans competitor in 1955, first considered redrawing some letters to make it more like these faces before abandoning the design project (now named \"Magnus\") around 1962\u20133."]}, {"page": "Rail Alphabet", "response": ["Rail Alphabet is a typeface designed by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert for signage on the British Rail network.

Two key differences are much larger counter spaces, the enclosed spaces in letters like the lower case \"e\" or \"a\", and a higher x-height, the relative height of the lower case \"x\" to the upper case \"X\". Smaller counter spaces in the FHWA fonts reduced legibility, particularly when the letters glowed from headlight illumination at night.
