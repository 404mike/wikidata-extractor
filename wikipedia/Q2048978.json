David Gooderson replaced him, but the Davros mask (which was originally fitted for Wisher) was five years old and in poor condition; as a result, it suffers in appearance.

K9's absence was because the prop was unsuitable for the large amount of location filming \u2014 the production team had suffered several problems using K9 on a similar location in The Stones of Blood, and were not keen on repeating the experience. Terry Nation has said he had no desire to use K9 in his storyline; the scene (as well as other continuity gestures to Season 16) was inserted during rewrites by Douglas Adams.", "Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in The Discontinuity Guide (1995) that the serial had \"a tacky, inconsequential feel that comes from a decade of having its best jokes sneered at.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker criticised Romana's bizarre regeneration, the implication that the Daleks were now robots, and David Gooderson's Davros, believing the character was not only harmed by being played by a lesser actor but that he was also not as well written. Despite this, they said the story \"ultimately manages to rise above all its undoubted failings and provides a fair degree of entertainment.\" In 2011, Mark Braxton of Radio Times wrote that the Daleks lacked menace and the script could be too comedic at times, but in spite of its flaws it was \"clattering good fun\". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn praised the first episode and the introduction of the new Romana, but felt the story quickly became dull and mishandled Davros and failed to do anything with the Daleks. Ian Berriman of SFX gave Destiny of the Daleks two out of five stars, criticising the Daleks as robots and much of the comedy.
