The team played well, with some excellent play from Cardiff's Reggie Gibbs. Jones himself was at the centre of two excellent moves; winning a line out and then placing an overhead punt, which Billy Pullen failed to handle correctly at the try line; and his own charge to the line which was just brought short of a try.Billot (1972), pg 35.

At Oundle and Cranwell, Gibbs, like his father, excelled as a sportsman, especially in rugby, tennis and squash. He trained as a pilot and specialised in maritime strike and reconnaissance. On 1 August 1936 he was commissioned into the Royal Air Force as a pilot officer, and was seconded to the Fleet Air Arm for two years.  With them he flew Shark and Swordfish planes off aircraft carriers, and he gained his first experience of launching torpedoes from the air. Gibbs was then posted to the Torpedo Training School at Gosport, where he became an instructor in aerial torpedoing."]}, {"page": "William Llewellyn Morgan", "response": ["By 1908, Morgan was back in Wales, and playing for first class Welsh team, Cardiff. It was while representing Cardiff, that Morgan was selected for the Anglo-Welsh team to tour Australia and New Zealand with his brother Teddy. The British team were outclassed in the first Test Match against New Zealand in Dunedin, and five replacements were made for the second test in Wellington, which included both Morgan and his brother. Morgan found himself one of three halfbacks, in an unorthodox formation which mimicked the New Zealand seven man pack. Joining Morgan at half back were two other Welsh players, James \"Tuan\" Jones and moved from threequarters, Reggie Gibbs.

In the 1907 Home Nations Championship, Wales had used both Teddy Morgan and Hopkin Maddock on the left wing, but when neither were available for the final Welsh encounter of the tournament, Jones was brought into the squad. The game was played on 9 March, with Welsh home advantage at the Cardiff Arms Park against Ireland. Jones came into a strong three-quarter, and was partnered opposite Johnnie Williams on the wing, with Pontypool team-mate John Hart Evans and Wales captain Rhys Gabe at centre. The Wales team were convincing winners, beating the Irish 29\u20130. All the points came from the backs with the three-quarters scoring five tries, three from Williams, one from Gabe, and Jones scored an international try on his debut.
