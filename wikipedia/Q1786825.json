Coming from a knightly family in Westmorland, he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland in 1311. He distinguished himself in the Scottish Wars, and in 1315 repulsed a siege on Carlisle Castle by Robert the Bruce. Shortly after this, he was taken captive by the Scots, and only released after a substantial ransom had been paid. His greatest achievement came in 1322, when he defeated the rebellious baron Thomas of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16\u201317 March. For this he was created Earl of Carlisle.\nAs one of the main military leaders on the border to Scotland, Harclay became frustrated with Edward II's inactivity, particularly the humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322, which made it clear that the war could not be won. Harclay initiated negotiations with the Scots on his own accord, and on 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce. The act was without royal sanction, and amounted to treason. The king issued an arrest order for the earl, and on 25 February Harclay was taken into the king's custody. He was arraigned before royal justices on 3 March, denied a hearing, and executed the same day. He was hanged, drawn and quartered, and the various parts of his body displayed in different parts of the country. His alleged treason, capture and execution is described in the Lanercost Chronicle. Only after five years was he allowed a proper burial, but the conviction for treason was never annulled.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 3", "response": ["*1323 \u2013 Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, English military leader"]}, {"page": "1323", "response": ["* March 3 \u2013 Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, English military leader"]}, {"page": "Earl of Carlisle", "response": ["* Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle (died 1323) (forfeit 1323)"]}, {"page": "Lord Warden of the Marches", "response": ["*Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle (1319\u2013) (executed 1323)"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1320\u20131329", "response": ["|Earl of Carlisle (1322)||Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle||1322||1323||Created Baron Harcla in 1321; attainted, and the title was forfeited"]}, {"page": "History of Cumbria", "response": ["The system of the Wardens of the Marches came into existence as a result of this First War of Scottish Independence (1296\u20131328) with areas on either side of the border being entrusted to 'wardens' who did what had previously been done by sheriffs in terms of military functions.Reid (1917), pp. 479\u2013496.

A type of customary law grew up (March law) whereby disputes and criminal cases were dealt with by the wardens, rather than by Royal justice as elsewhere in the country.

Treason was based on an allegiance to the sovereign from all subjects aged\u00a014 or over, and it remained for the king and his judges to determine whether that allegiance had been broken. Edward III's justices had offered somewhat overzealous interpretations of what activities constituted treason, \"calling felonies treasons and afforcing indictments by talk of accroachment of the royal power\", prompting parliamentary demands to clarify the law. Edward therefore introduced the Treason Act 1351. It was enacted at a time in English history when a monarch's right to rule was indisputable and was therefore written principally to protect the throne and sovereign. The new law offered a narrower definition of treason than had existed before and split the old feudal offence into two classes. Petty treason referred to the killing of a master (or lord) by his servant, a husband by his wife, or a prelate by his clergyman. Men guilty of petty treason were drawn and hanged, whereas women were burned."]}, {"page": "Siege of Carlisle (1315)", "response": ["Carlisle Castle was a strong position, defended by a garrison commanded by Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, an experienced veteran soldier.
