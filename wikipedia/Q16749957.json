Manager Bill Dodgin preferred him on the right, however, (where he replaced Billy Bevis), teaming up with the ageing Bill Rochford. This role was not to Grant's liking and his form slumped. Although he was transfer-listed in August 1948, he remained with Southampton for the next two seasons, used occasionally as replacement for Eric Day. In 1948\u201349 he seemed settled back on the left before he lost his place to Bill Heaton. After a rather frustrating time, he joined Cardiff City in March 1950 with Ernie Stevenson coming to the south coast in exchange. In his four seasons at The Dell he made 64 appearances scoring 13 goals."]}, {"page": "Heaton (surname)", "response": ["* Bill Heaton (1918\u20131990), English footballer"]}]}}
