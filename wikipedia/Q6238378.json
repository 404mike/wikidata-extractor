Hayes was best known for his skill at seamanship and his interest in the design and construction of naval vessels, beginning with his childhood education at Deptford Dockyard where his uncle Adam was a master shipbuilder. During his naval service he participated in the first and the last significant frigate actions of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, from the inconclusive engagement between Embuscade and HMS Boston in 1793 and the capture of USS President in 1815. After the war's end, Hayes was appointed as superintendent of HMNB Devonport and later was commander in chief off West Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Hayes", "response": ["John Hayes may refer to:", "*John Hayes (director) (1930\u20132000), American director of low-budget films", "*John Hayes (radio), American radio executive", "*John Hayes (1643\u20131705), MP for Winchelsea", "*John Hayes (Australian politician) (1868\u20131956), Australian politician, Premier of Tasmania, 1922\u20131923", "*John Hayes (British politician) (born 1958), British politician and MP", "*Se\u00e1n Hayes (Cork politician) (otherwise known as John Hayes, died 1941), Sinn F\u00e9in member of the 1st D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, and the 2nd and 3rd", "*John Hayes (New Zealand politician) (born 1948), New Zealand diplomat and politician", "*John Hayes (Queensland politician) (1897\u20131986), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*John Hayes (explorer) (1768\u20131831), of the British East India Company", "*John Hayes (Royal Navy officer) (1767/1775\u20131838), Royal Navy admiral", "*Sir John Hayes, 1st Baronet (c. 1750\u20131809), military physician", "*John Hayes (sailor) (1832\u20131911), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Hayes (footballer, born 1903) (1903\u20131977), Australian rules footballer for Fitzroy", "*John Hayes (footballer, born 1936), Australian rules footballer for St Kilda", "*John Hayes (footballer, born 1939), Australian rules footballer, former Fitzroy VFL captain", "*John Hayes (cricketer) (1927\u20132007), New Zealand Test cricketer", "*John Hayes (harness racer) (1919\u20131998), harness racing driver/trainer/owner", "*John Hayes (rugby union) (born 1973), Irish prop forward", "*John Hayes (rugby league) (born 1939), Australian rugby league footballer", "*John Hayes (Gaelic footballer), Irish Gaelic football player", "*John Hayes (soccer) (born 1960), U.S. soccer player", "*John Hayes (tennis) (born 1955), American tennis player, who was on the tour in the early 1980s", "*John Hayes (baseball) (1855\u20131904), baseball player", "*John Hayes (1685\u20131726), killed by his wife Catherine Hayes (murderer); tried for the murder and executed by burning at the stake.", "*John Hayes (painter) (1786?\u20131866), British portrait artist", "*John Hayes (art historian) (1929\u20132005), British art historian and museum director, expert on Gainsborough", "*John Hayes, co-founder of software publisher Peachtree Accounting"]}, {"page": "West Africa Squadron", "response": ["|5 || Commodore || 25px || John Hayes ||1831"]}, {"page": "Capture of USS President", "response": ["Meanwhile, the British squadron blockading New York consisted of the former ship of the line  which had been razeed (cut down) to create a 32-pounder frigate, the 24-pounder frigate HMS Forth, and the 18-pounder frigates HMS Pomone and HMS Tenedos. Commodore John Hayes was in overall command as the captain of Majestic.Lambert The 24-pounder frigate  had attempted to cut out (send the boats to board and capture) the privateer  and had lost many of her crew, and Captain Henry Hope had expected to be sent back to Britain as Endymion by that time was an old ship (built in 1797) and her crew had been weakened by the battle. To his surprise, however, Admiral Henry Hotham ordered Endymion to remain on the North American Station as Endymion was the fastest ship in the Royal Navy, and he ordered some replacement crew to be drafted from the 56-gun razee . Hope went to unusual lengths to train his new crew in anticipation of imminent combat using the same methods as were used by Philip Broke on . The combination of Endymions handling, speed, 24-pounder armament and the crew's training meant that she was better prepared for battle than most other frigates.

He had married Laura, a daughter of Rear-Admiral John Hayes, and it is probable that this accounts for the connection with the navy that the school developed. Another factor affecting its primary purpose was the introduction in 1838 of an entrance examination for the Royal Navy: although initially an undemanding test for most, this decision encouraged the development of specialised educational establishments, of which Stubbington House was a very early example. In addition, Hampshire has a historically close connection to the navy, and the closure of the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth in 1837, together with the deployment of HMS Britannia as a cadet training ship proved to be timely."]}, {"page": "HMS Dryad (1795)", "response": ["By November 1829 Dryad was recommissioning in Plymouth for foreign service.
