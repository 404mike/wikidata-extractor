Following the defeat of the Scullin government in 1931 amidst the split, Makin was an outspoken loyalist of official Labor, alleging that he had been subject to an attempt to bribe him to leave the party, condemning both the pro-Premiers' Plan and Lang Labor defectors, and repeatedly clashing with Premier Lionel Hill. His staunch opposition to the Premiers' Plan led to him being rumoured as a potential challenger to Scullin for the federal Labor leadership, although he denied interest and no challenge eventuated. At the 1931 federal election, Makin was the only Labor member elected from South Australia."]}, {"page": "1963 in Australia", "response": ["* 19 March \u2013 Lionel Hill, Premier of South Australia (born 1881)"]}, {"page": "1933 in Australia", "response": ["*Premier of South Australia \u2013 Lionel Hill (until 13 February), then Robert Richards (until 18 April), then Richard L.
