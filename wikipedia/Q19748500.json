The five-light east window of the chancel was designed by Kempe in 1874 or 1875, and shows a Nativity scene, the Crucifixion, and several saints.  In the vestry, which is kept locked, is a striking, quasi-Art Nouveau depiction of Mary Magdalene over the text \"She hath done what she could\" (Mark 14:8).  It was produced by Lowndes and Drury, to a design attributed by one authority to Mary Lowndes, by another to Isobel Lilian Gloag.  According to the art historian Peter Cormack it was designed by Gloag and painted by Lowndes."]}, {"page": "Isobel L.
