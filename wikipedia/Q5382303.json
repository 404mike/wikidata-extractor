The bowling attack was strong, the team contained some experienced players and critics believed Ephraim Lockwood to be the best professional batsman in the country. In 1873, Yorkshire won seven games and lost five and for the following season, Luke Greenwood replaced Rowbotham as captain. The team had an improved record, but although second only to Gloucestershire, Yorkshire lost heavily in both encounters between the teams. Greenwood retired, Rowbotham resumed the captaincy for 1875, and Lockwood took over in 1876. The team did not perform particularly well in either season, but their worst performance came in 1877, winning two games \u2013 but none of the last ten \u2013 and losing seven. This placed them eighth out of nine counties.", "The team faded again in 1882 and Hawke, who had refused the captaincy earlier, was appointed team captain at the end of the season, the first amateur to hold this position. Previous captains had all been professionals: Roger Iddison (1863\u201372), Joseph Rowbotham (1873 and 1875), Luke Greenwood (1874), Ephraim Lockwood (1876\u201377) and Tom Emmett (1878\u201382). Hawke remained in charge for 28 seasons until 1910, during which time the team won eight County Championships."]}, {"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["In a tribute to Hawke, the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack related that Hawke's \"strength of the character was tested\" when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of \"elements that were not entirely harmonious\". Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgment and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England\". Derek Birley commented on the Yorkshire team to 1883 as \"gifted but scarcely house-trained professionals\" who were often described as \"ten drunks and a parson\".Birley, pp. 134\u2013135. The odd man out was Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for them. Their best players included Emmett, Ephraim Lockwood, George Ulyett, Ted Peate, Billy Bates and Allen Hill, while Bobby Peel made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882. Birley added that their performances and \"rough-hewn image\" had become an embarrassment to the gentlemanly wing of the club and the decision was taken to appoint a captain who would \"instill discipline and sobriety into this wayward team\"."]}, {"page": "1875 English cricket season", "response": ["|Ephraim Lockwood || Yorkshire|| 22 || 39 || 4 || 968 || 74 || 27.65 || 0 || 5"]}, {"page": "1876 English cricket season", "response": ["|Ephraim Lockwood || YorkshireAll England Eleven|| 25 || 44 || 5 || 1261 || 108 not out || 32.33 || 1 || 9"]}, {"page": "Robert Smith (Derbyshire cricketer)", "response": ["Smith took part in the very first fixture played by Derbyshire as a county team in the 1871 season, against a Lancashire side who posted the lowest total against Derbyshire in the history of first-class cricket.

Also in 1874, he appeared for the United North of England team in a first-class match against the South. His team included early leading lights of cricket such as Tom Emmett, former Yorkshire captain Ephraim Lockwood, and uncle-and-nephew pairing Andrew (a two-time Test player) and Yorkshire captain Luke Greenwood. The South of England had at their disposal early soon-to-become Test greats such as James Lillywhite jnr., Harry Jupp, and Dr. William Gilbert Grace, a combination of early Test cricketers who served to overpower their less experienced opponents.
