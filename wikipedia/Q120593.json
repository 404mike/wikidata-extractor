Like its predecessor, lyrics weren't written or recorded until all but Bowie and Visconti departed. Seabrook characterises this stage of recording as \"sporadic bursts of inspiration surrounded by longer stretches of contemplation.\" When making The Idiot and Lust for Life with Iggy Pop, Bowie became fascinated with Pop's ability to improvise lyrics while standing at the microphone. For \"Heroes\", he decided to use the same method. Visconti later attested: \"He'd never have a clue what he'd sing about until he actually walked in front of the microphone.\" Bowie usually completed his vocals in only one or two takes; Visconti provided backing vocals in the same fashion. The final mixes were done at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland, a studio that would become one of Bowie's mainstays. An engineer at Mountain, Dave Richards, would also become one of his regulars. Richards' assistant was Eugene Chaplin, the son of silent film star Charlie Chaplin."]}, {"page": "Lodger (album)", "response": ["*Eugene Chaplin\u00a0\u2013 assistant engineer"]}, {"page": "Kiera Chaplin", "response": ["Chaplin was born in Belfast, the eldest daughter of Eugene Chaplin and his wife, Bernadette.David Thomas, \"When Chaplin played father\", The Daily Telegraph, 17 May 2012 She grew up in the same town as her father, in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, until her parents' divorce in the mid-1990s."]}, {"page": "Dome Cinema, Worthing", "response": ["The publicity seemed to attract other bidders for the Dome, amongst them Eugene Chaplin (the son of Charlie Chaplin) and an unnamed consortium. In spite of the competition Chapman's bid was successful. Then it was discovered that the then Department of National Heritage had upgraded the Dome's status from grade II listed to grade II*, a status only four other cinemas in Britain shared. The Electric Cinema in Portobello Road, the Scala Cinema in Ilkeston (now the Scala (club)), the Torbay Picture House in Paignton, and the Elite Cinema in Nottingham. The addition of the star to the grade II listing meant that any future application for building work had to be considered by the Secretary of State for National Heritage."]}, {"page": "Peter Gibson (writer)", "response": ["He attended Arizona State University, Fairfield University and New York University, where he concentrated his studies in Chaos Theory.
