He played first-class cricket mainly for Kent County Cricket Club and made one Test cricket appearance for England in 1884. He was one of ten brothers who all played cricket in Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marylebone Cricket Club", "response": ["Presidents serve a twelve-month term and cannot normally serve two terms in succession. Notable exceptions occurred during World War I and World War II. In 1914, Lord Hawke was appointed president and was asked to remain in the post till the end of the war.Pope & Dyson, pp. 50\u201351. As a result, Hawke was MCC President for five years from 1914 to 1918 inclusive and was succeeded in 1919 by the former Hampshire slow left-arm bowler Henry Forster, who shortly afterwards was raised to the peerage with the title of Lord Forster. Throughout the war, Lord's was used for military purposes, including training and recreation. Problems frequently arose but, in Wisden's view, Hawke was \"the greatest help in giving wise counsel towards their solution\". Hawke's tenure was exceeded by that of Stanley Christopherson who was appointed in 1939 and remained in situ for seven years until 1945 before he was succeeded by General Ronald Adam.Barclay, p. 49. In his Barclays World of Cricket essay about the MCC Presidency, E. W. Swanton said that \"there is no pretence of democracy about it\" and commented on how few were untitled up to the Second World War. As he said, membership of the aristocracy was a more important factor than any cricketing prowess.Barclay, pp. 48\u201349. In the 21st century there have been MCC Presidents who as players were wholly professional: Tom Graveney, Derek Underwood, Mike Gatting and Matthew Fleming. The 2018-19 President, Anthony Wreford, nominated Kumar Sangakkara as his successor in May 2019; Sangakkara became MCC's first non-British President."]}, {"page": "Montague Druitt", "response": ["While working at Blackheath, Druitt joined the local cricket club, Blackheath Morden, and became the club's treasurer.Montague Druitt, CricInfo, ESPN EMEA Ltd, retrieved 26 November 2011Begg, The Definitive History, p. 259; Leighton, p. 37 It was a well-connected club: the president was politician Sir Charles Mills and one of its players was Stanley Christopherson, who later became president of the Marylebone Cricket Club.Leighton, p. 37 After the merger of the club with other local sports associations to form the Blackheath Cricket, Football and Lawn Tennis Company, Druitt took on the additional roles of company secretary and director.Begg, The Facts, p. 323; Leighton, p. 42; McDonald, p. 91", "In June 1888, Lord Harris played twice for Blackheath with Druitt and Stanley Christopherson; Blackheath won both matches easily, but Druitt was out of form and contributed neither runs nor wickets in either match.Leighton, pp. 84, 191\u2013192 In August 1888, Druitt played for the Gentlemen of Bournemouth against the Parsees cricket team during their tour of England, and took five wickets in the visitors' first innings.

Of the team's previously successful bowlers, Major Booth had been killed in the war, Alonzo Drake had died soon afterwards from illness, and George Hirst was past his best. Although Wilfred Rhodes was able to ease the shortfall by resuming his career as a frontline spin bowler, Yorkshire needed new bowlers, particularly pacemen. Macaulay had been spotted playing club cricket by Sir Stanley Christopherson, a former Kent player. Subsequently, Harry Hayley, a 19th-century Yorkshire cricketer, saw Macaulay in action and was sufficiently impressed to recommend him for a trial with the county. At the beginning of the 1920 season, Macaulay played in two warm-up games for Yorkshire, taking six wickets for 52 runs in a one-day game and four for 24 and two for 19 in a two-day game. This was good enough to earn a first-class debut on 15 May 1920 against Derbyshire in the County Championship, although he only took one wicket. Playing in the early part of the season, he took five wickets for 50 runs, his first five wicket haul, against Gloucestershire, followed by six for 47 against Worcestershire. He continued to play until the middle of June before dropping out of the team after an unsuccessful match against Surrey.Woodhouse, p. 305. In ten first-class matches, he had taken 24 wickets at an average of 24.35, and managed a top score of just 15 with the bat. Wisden said he \"had neither the pace nor the stamina required\", while it later said he tried to bowl at speeds beyond his capability. Even so, he decided to become a professional cricketer. Hirst and Rhodes persuaded him to reduce his pace and concentrate on bowling a good length while trying to spin the ball. He practised through the winter of 1920\u201321 to be ready for the next season."]}, {"page": "Ian Akers-Douglas", "response": ["Akers-Douglas' father was the second son of Aretas Akers-Douglas, 1st Viscount Chilston.
