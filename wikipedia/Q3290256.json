He played as a centre for Toulouse, Edinburgh, and the Scottish national team.\nAfter moving from Edinburgh to Toulouse, Di Rollo endured a difficult time at the club. He only ever played one minute for the club due to conflicting medical opinions over a heart murmur he has carried since birth and left after a season. After a difficult season he returned to play for Scotland A in 2008.Marcus Di Rollo was not favoured by the former Scotland national rugby union coach Matt Williams despite the support of respected Scottish rugby commentators such as Allan Massie. But under Frank Hadden, Di Rollo became a regular fixture in the national team.\nDi Rollo earned his first cap as a second-half substitute in the 65\u201323 victory against the USA on the 2002 summer tour. He also made a try-scoring debut in the uncapped game against the Barbarians in May 2001 with an interception try. Scotland were grateful for the intervention of Marcus Di Rollo in the Autumn Test against Samoa in November 2005. The Scots were being held 11\u201311 by the Pacific Islanders when the then Edinburgh Gunners centre crossed over the line for his first try in the late win.\nIn 2010, Di Rollo was appointed head coach at Watsonians RFC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rollo (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Marcus Di Rollo (born 1978), Scottish rugby union footballer"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh Rugby", "response": ["*  Marcus Di Rollo"]}, {"page": "Watsonian FC", "response": ["The 1st XV team enjoyed a successful 2005\u201306 season, winning the BT Cup and finishing second in the Scottish Premiership, Division 1.
