With the opponent lying prone, the wrestler lies on the opponent's back, at a 90\u00b0 angle to them, putting some or all of their weight on the opponent to prevent them from moving. The opponent's arm is then hooked and pulled back into their body, stretching the forearms, biceps, and pectoral muscles. Variations of this can include clasping the opponent's hand instead of hooking the upper arm, for extra leverage and bridging out, while performing the move to increase leverage and immobilize the opponent. A kneeling variation also exists. Becky Lynch uses it as the Dis-arm-her, where the attacking wrestler takes a face-down opponent's arm in a kneeling position, adding pressure by pulling back on the arm. A reverse version also exists, with the opponent lying on their back, the wrestler lies on the mat, putting some or all of their weight on the opponent to prevent them from moving. The opponent's arm is then hooked and pulled back into their body, stretching the forearms, biceps, and pectoral muscles. The regular hold was used by Deonna Purrazzo, MJF, and Timothy Thatcher, while the bridging version was used by Mark Haskins as the Star Armbar while Tommaso Ciampa briefly uses it as his submission finisher.

His injuries were accumulating, including osteophytes on his neck which caused pain during simple tasks, such as brushing his teeth and touching the collar of his gown, and a visual impairment in his right eye which was discovered in 2007. Misawa had also long been a chain smoker. Misawa mostly worked mid-card tag matches where his partners did much of the work, which was how Giant Baba had remained an active wrestler until the last two months of his life.

Around this time, Noah announced that they would no longer take their entire roster on tours in order to cut travel costs. On December 17, Nippon TV announced that they would be cutting Noah's television program in March to compensate for advertising losses in the wake of the Great Recession. This marked the end of a 55-year period of wrestling programming on the station, going back to the JWA.
