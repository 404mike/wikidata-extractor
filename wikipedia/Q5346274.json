He top-scored with 41 in the second innings of his debut against Yorkshire,\nbut his career was not successful.\nBryant made 63 in the first innings against Essex in June 1924,\nbut this was to prove his only half-century. Indeed, his duck in the second innings of that match began a dreadful sequence of scores: he was dismissed for nought five times in six innings (making just 5 in the other), and for single figures in the four innings immediately thereafter.\nHe played his last match against Nottinghamshire in June 1925; his final innings was another duck.", "link_mentions": {}}}
