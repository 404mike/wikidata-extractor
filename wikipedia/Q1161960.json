With a second edition in 1869 and a third in 1878 this book was reprinted until at least 1891. Oliver regarded this book as suitable for use in schools and for young people remote from the classroom and laboratory. He was elected a member of the Linnean Society, awarded their Gold Medal in 1893, and awarded a Royal Medal by the Royal Society in 1884.He married in 1861 and was the father of two daughters and a son, Francis Wall Oliver.In 1895, botanist Tiegh published Oliverella, a genus of flowering plants from East Africa, belonging to the family Loranthaceae and named in honour of Daniel Oliver.He died of heart failure at his house on Kew Green on 21 December, 1916.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*Daniel Oliver"]}, {"page": "Kew", "response": ["* Daniel Oliver (1830\u20131916), Professor of Botany at University College, London (1861\u20131888) and Keeper of the Herbarium at Kew Gardens (1864\u20131890), who lived on Kew Green."]}, {"page": "Dipteronia", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Daniel Oliver"]}, {"page": "On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection", "response": ["About thirty were present, including two unnamed guests from overseas, with many there to hear an obituary notice for the former president and botanist Robert Brown given by Lyell. Wallace's natural history agent Samuel Stevens happened to be present, while Darwin's friends there included William Benjamin Carpenter and the geologist William Henry Fitton. Amongst the others, Daniel Oliver and Arthur Henfry would later support evolution, while Cuthbert Collingwood became an opponent. George Bentham was persuaded by Hooker to step down so that the Darwin and Wallace papers were first on the agenda, followed by six other papers on botanical and zoological topics. Bell had introduced discussions at the end of meetings, but there was no discussion of natural selection, perhaps because of the amount of business that had been dealt with, or possibly due to polite reluctance to speak out against a theory which the eminent Lyell and Hooker were supporting. Bentham noted that the audience appeared fatigued. Hooker later said there was \"no semblance of a discussion\", though \"it was talked over with bated breath\" at tea afterwards, and in his reminiscences many years later thought \"the subject [was] too ominous for the old school to enter the lists before armouring.\" Although Bell apparently disapproved, the Vice-President promptly removed all references to immutability from his own paper which was awaiting publication.."]}, {"page": "Emil Holub", "response": ["* In 1884, Daniel Oliver published and described in Hooker's book Icones Plantarum (Hooker's Icon.

It is now known as Otholobium fruticans. This name was published in the Species Plantarum in 1753, the first work to consistently apply binomial names. Two further species were described by Carl Linnaeus the Younger in 1781. He named them Psoralea rotundifolia and P. stachydis, and these species are now known as Otholobium rotundifolium and O. hirtum. This was followed in 1794 by Jean Louis Marie Poiret who added P. acuminata, P. ononoides and P. sericea, which are currently named O. acuminatum, O. virgatum and O. sericeum respectively. When Carl Thunberg, who visited the Cape from 1772 till 1775, revised Psoralea  in 1823, and therein added P. tomentosa, P. racemosa, P. argentea and P. striata (now O. sericeum, O. racemosum, O. argenteum and O. striatum). Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer described in 1832 Psoralea obliqua (now Otholobium obliquum), P. bracteata var. bracteata (now O. fruticans) and P. bracteata var. brevibracteata (the current O. bracteolatum). In 1836, Psoralea was reviewed by Christian Friedrich Ecklon and Karl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher, who distinguished P. albicans (= O. argenteum), P. algoensis and P. bracteolata (which are considered to be conspecific and are known today as O. bracteolatum), P. candicans (now O. candicans), P. cephalotes and P. stachyerum (both now included in O. stachyerum), P. hilaris (currently O. racemosum), P. polyphylla (now O. polyphyllum), P. rupicola (now included in O. striatum), P. uncinata (now O. uncinatum) and P. venusta (now O. venustum). In the same year Meyer published a revision in which he distinguished P. carnea, P. obliqua, P. parviflora, P. triantha (now known as O. carneum, O. obliquum, O. parviflorum and O. trianthum respectively), P. cephalotes (= O. stachyerum), P. densa (= O. acuminatum), and P. spathulata (= O. mundianum). In Volume II of the Flora Capensis, published in 1862, William Henry Harvey newly described P. bowieana, P. hamata, P. macradenia, P. polysticta and P. thomii (now O. bowieanum, O. hamatum, O. macradenium, O. polysticum, O. thomii). Daniel Oliver described Psoralea foliosa (= O. foliosum) in 1885, while Edmund Gilbert Baker distinguished P. foliosa var. gazense (= O.  subsp. gazense) in 1911. Helena Forbes added in 1930 P. bolusii (= Otholobium bolusii) and P. royffei (included in O. caffrum).
