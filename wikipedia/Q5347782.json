Both halls have now been demolished, but both families are still represented today, the head of the \"West Hall\" family being Sir Edward Leigh MP but no longer associated or living within the parish and that of the \"East Hall\" family being headed by Richard, 6th Baron Grey of Codnor. A member of a cadet branch of the Leigh of West Hall family was created a baronet in 1773 as Sir Egerton Leigh, but this title is now dormant. Other cadet branches were the Leigh-Traffords of nearby Oughtrington Hall as well as the Barons Leigh of Stoneleigh Abbey in Warwickshire and the Barons Newton of Lyme Park. The third lordship of the manor was held by the Egerton family of Tatton and all three landed families swapped and consolidated their estates throughout the 18th and 19th centuries until the Egerton Leighs sold their High Legh estate to the Cornwall-Leghs just before World War I.  When Maurice, 4th and last Lord Egerton of Tatton, sold off the remaining farms and land in High Legh in the 1930s, so ended a connection dating back to the 13th century.", "East Hall was demolished in the early 1970s (as West Hall had been some 20 years previously) and the debris was used as foundations for the first Thelwall viaduct bridge of the M6. High Legh Hall (the East Hall) resembled nearby Tatton Park and the West Hall (Egerton Leigh family) was a beautiful Tudor building similar architecturally to Little Moreton Hall.", "High Legh was recorded in the Domesday Survey as having two Saxons theins (Ulviet or Wulfgeat, and Dob).  The boundary between Mere and High Legh is still known as Dobb Lane and is, in fact, the medieval boundary between the two parishes.  A moated site has been found, alongside the Roman road which connected Wilderspool and Latchford to Watling Street (A556) which contained Samian pottery from Cirencester, a Roman cloak clasp, and a flint knife.  High Legh was also a high-status Bronze Age burial site.  High Legh is the location of an early Methodist chapel in Northwood Lane, with Wesleyan connections.  Northwood Methodist Chapel was founded by the Okell family of High Legh (who married into the Egerton Leigh (West Hall) family).  In the early 19th century, Robert Moffat, a young Scottish man, came to work on the West Hall estate as a gardener, but in 1814 he joined the London Missionary Society and moved to Plantation Farm in Dukinfield.  In 1816 he left with his wife for southern Africa where he became a missionary; his daughter met and fell in love with their student preacher, David Livingstone.  The oldest building in the parish is believed to be St Mary's Chapel, formerly the domestic chapel of the Cornwall-Legh family of High Legh Hall (or East Hall), which is sometimes open to the public. However, other older buildings in the parish contain wattle and daub but no evidence of their dates has yet been established.", "The Anglican Church of St John was formerly the domestic chapel of the Leighs of West Hall (Egerton Leigh family)."]}, {"page": "Mid Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Egerton Leigh || Conservative"]}, {"page": "Cheshire dialect", "response": ["Early references include English proverbs and dialect words collected by John Ray in the 17th century, and a glossary of Cheshire words compiled by Roger Wilbraham in 1817 and expanded in 1826.Wilbraham, R.
