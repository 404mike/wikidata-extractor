She was known for her portraits of Queen Victoria and her family, and, paintings of children and fairy subjects.  On the reverse of two pastels by Troubridge, Margaret and Wanderers, was the same newspaper cutting.The newspaper cutting on the verso states that she studied painting in London, being advised by John Millais, and working in Mr. Cope's studio, and exhibited at the New Gallery, the Dudley Gallery, and other exhibitions. It also states that she was a member of the Pastel Society and painted between 700 and 800 portraits, including two of the Queen of Spain as a child, the daughters of the Duke and Duchess of Connaught at Osborne House in 1891 for presentation to Queen Victoria, and two portraits of Queen Mary in 1903.She was self-taught and a command to paint twenty-two of Queen Victoria's grandchildren instantly made her artistic reputation.  During the years 1893 - 1901 she, exhibited at the Dudley Gallery and the New Gallery, and, was a member of the Society of Women Artists and the Royal Society Portrait Painters.  At an exhibition and sale, in aid of three charities for women, held in 1896 at Reuben David Sassoon's house Troubridge contributed a pastel \u2018of delicate workmanship\u2019 called L\u2019Enfant Prodigue.  Reporting on an exhibition held in 1903 The Guardian comments: In the Groves Gallery Mrs. Adrian C. Hope has a number of works in pastel entitled \u201cFriends and Fancies.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0The friends are pretty children whose prettiness loses nothing in the hands of the artist.\u00a0 The fancies are mostly inspired by nursery rhymes, and they are touched with a neat and whimsical charm that enlivens their somewhat arbitrary drawing.Her journals (1873-1884) record her designing decorative tiles and Christmas cards from early on.  In 1882 the Magazine of Art reports \u201cChristmas card publishers have produced some lovely specimens this year\u2026Laura Troubridge uses a novel medium in her Japanese Designs with gold and colors on gelatine.\u00a0 Her Children in Wonderland is also quite good.\u201d  In 1891 W.A Mansell & Co. announced that they were reinventing Christmas cards from being \u2018mere flimsy pasteboard with hackneyed quotations\u2019 to \u2018objects of design, skilled execution and literary style\u2019. The following year The British Trade Journal writes of the success of the new idea and that the \u201cfirm has spared no trouble and cost in procuring new designs by well-known artists\u2026we notice a number of charming sketches by Miss Laura Troubridge printed in red and gold and in colours\u201d"]}, {"page": "David Sassoon", "response": ["*Reuben David Sassoon (1835\u20131905), English merchant"]}]}}
