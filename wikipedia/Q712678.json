Hunter was a musician and songwriter before joining Mott the Hoople, and continued in this vein after he left the band. He embarked on a solo career despite ill health and disillusionment with commercial success, and often worked in collaboration with Mick Ronson, David Bowie's sideman and arranger from The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars period.Mott the Hoople achieved some commercial success, and attracted a small but devoted fan base. As a solo artist, Hunter charted with lesser-known but more wide-ranging works outside the rock mainstream. His best-known solo songs are \"Once Bitten, Twice Shy\", later covered by Great White, and \"England Rocks\", which was modified to \"Cleveland Rocks\" and then covered by The Presidents of the United States of America, and became one of the theme songs used for the American TV series The Drew Carey Show.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 3", "response": ["*  1939   \u2013 Ian Hunter, English singer-songwriter and guitarist "]}, {"page": "The Presidents of the United States of America (band)", "response": ["Pure Frosting featured two songs that had previously been used in a movie and as a television show theme. \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" was included on the soundtrack for The Wedding Singer, while \"Cleveland Rocks\", originally recorded by Ian Hunter, was chosen as the theme song for The Drew Carey Show.
