The books are written in a poetic, richly creative style, evoking emotional and sensual responses, leavened with humour and irony.Down the Garden Path (1932)  The three books were so popular that they led to  humorous imitations, including Mon Repos (1934) by \"Nicholas Bevel\" (a parody by Muriel Hine) and Garden Rubbish (1936) by W.
