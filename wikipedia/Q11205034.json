Batty was educated at Repton School, St Chad's College, Durham University and Keble College, Oxford.\nOn graduating from Durham University in 1995, Batty joined Hampshire. However, he was not retained. He continued his career on in minor county cricket before being offered contracts with Somerset and Surrey. He chose to become Surrey's third-choice wicket-keeper after Graham Kersey and Alec Stewart. Kersey, however, died from injuries in a car crash in Australia. With Stewart often unavailable to Surrey due to England duties, Batty was able to enjoy regular first team action, often opening the batting when Mark Butcher was also playing for England. Batty was a regular player in Surrey's sustained success, winning three county championships around the turn of the century.\nFollowing Stewart's retirement from international cricket at the end of the 2003 season, Batty was surprisingly not mentioned in media discussions over Stewart's replacement \u2013 despite a county average of 57 that season. England's chairman of selectors, David Graveney said Batty's performances do not go unnoticed, but he remained in the international wilderness.\nBatty captained Surrey in 2004. However, after a poor season, which saw champions Surrey relegated in the One Day Pro40 tournament, Batty was replaced as captain by Mark Butcher. However, Batty retained his place in the side and was awarded a benefit year by the county in 2009.\nBatty equalled the world record for most catches in an innings with 8, against Kent at The Oval in 2004. Shortly afterwards he broke the record for most catches in a match with 11, against Lancashire, breaking the record of then Surrey coach Steve Rixon.It was announced in October 2009 that Batty was leaving Surrey, having signed a three-year contract with Gloucestershire. He retired following the end of the 2012 season. In an article in the Daily Telegraph reviewing his career, Simon Briggs claimed that he was \"the finest uncapped player of the last 20 years\".Batty was named the coach of Surrey women and Oval Invincibles women in March 2021. Under his coaching, Oval Invincibles women won the inaugural season of The Hundred in August 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Chad's College, Durham", "response": ["* Jonathan Batty, cricketer, Surrey and Gloucestershire wicketkeeper and opening batsman"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Jonathan Batty"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Surrey had the better of the first three days at Whitgift School, which is located in Croydon and is now in its fifth year as a festival venue.
