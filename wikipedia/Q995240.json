Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, UK, he has released some twenty-two albums and several singles since the 1970s as well as guesting as guitarist on many other albums by rock and folk artists. He continues to tour in the UK, appearing mostly at smaller venues, Christian centres and at prisons. He has also appeared three times at the UK Greenbelt Festival. His chosen instruments include guitar (particularly slide or bottleneck guitar) and mandolin.\nHe recorded sessions for the John Peel show on BBC Radio 1 in 1974, 1975 and 1976, and made two television appearances on BBC Two's The Old Grey Whistle Test. Also in the 1970s, Haworth appeared on the weekly ITV television show \"Pop Gospel\", presented by Berni Flint.\nTogether with wife Sally, Haworth has engaged in extensive musical and evangelical work in prison settings. Haworth has his own website and is featured in the current Crossrythms artists catalogue.A sample of Haworth's music, together with a list of forthcoming concert dates, may be found on his MySpace Music page. A 2003 review of The Gap album concluded: \"He's largely unknown, but those who follow virtuosos know about this guy\".John Ingham, for Sounds music paper, wrote:\n\n. . . if we are to have God-rock, then let it be Bryn Haworth; he thinks of the music foremost . . . you owe yourself a listen.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christian rock", "response": ["Christian rock was often viewed as a marginal part of the nascent contemporary Christian music (CCM) and contemporary gospel industry in the 1970s and 1980s, though Christian folk rock artists like Bruce Cockburn and rock fusion artists like Phil Keaggy had some cross-over success. Petra and Resurrection Band, two of the bands who brought harder rock into the early CCM community, had their origins in the early to mid-1970s. They reached their height in popularity in the late eighties alongside other Christian-identifying hard rock acts such as Stryper. The latter had videos played on MTV, such as \"Calling on You\" and \"To Hell with the Devil\", and even saw some airtime on mainstream radio stations with their hit song \"Honestly\".
