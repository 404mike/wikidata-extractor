Along with the West Country, this was one of the regions that most firmly adopted reed instruments, producing many eminent practitioners of the melodeon from the mid-19th century. Also like the West Country it is one of the few regions where there is still an active tradition of step dancing and like the Midlands the tradition of Molly dance died out in the 1930s.'Step Dancing', East Anglian Traditional Music Trust, http://www.eatmt.org.uk/stepdancing.htm, retrieved 16/02/09. The region was relatively neglected by folk song collectors of the first revival. Lucy Broadwood and Cecil Sharp collected in Cambridgeshire, as did and Vaughan Williams as well as in Norfolk and Essex from 1905, but most important regional figure was composer Ernest John Moeran, who collected over 150 songs in Norfolk and Suffolk in the 1920s.R. Vaughan Williams, Folk Songs from the Eastern Counties (London, 1908) and E. J. Moeran, Six Folk Songs from Norfolk (London, 1924) and E. J. Moeran, Six Suffolk Folk-Songs (London, 1932). The second folk revival led to the discovery of many East Anglian folk musicians, including Suffolk melodeon player Oscar Woods, Norfolk singers Sam Larner (1878\u20131965), Harry Cox (1885\u20131971) and Walter Pardon (1914\u201396); Suffolk fiddler Harkie Nesling (1890\u20131978); Suffolk singer and bargeman Bob Roberts (1907\u201382), many of whom recorded for Topic Records.East Anglian Traditional Music Trust, http://www.eatmt.org.uk/profiles.htm, retrieved 16/02/09. Perhaps the most influential folk dance musical album was English Country Dance Music (1965), put together by Reg Hall and Bob Davenport with largely Norfolk musicians, it was the first instrumental recording of folk instruments. Also from Norfolk was Peter Bellamy, who in solo projects, with the Young Tradition and in theatrical productions was probably one of the most influential musicians of the post revival period.\u2019Peter Bellamy\u2019, Daily Telegraph, 26/9/08.

As a song-collector, she began by setting down the 300 songs that she already knew from her mother's knee. Ritchie and her husband George Pickow spent 18 months tape recording, interviewing and photographing singers, including Elizabeth Cronin,  Tommy and Sarah Makem, Leo Rowsome, and Seamus Ennis in Ireland, Jeannie Robertson and Jimmy MacBeath in Scotland, and Harry Cox and Bob Roberts in England. When people asked what sort of songs they were looking for, Ritchie would sometimes ask them if they knew Barbara Allen and sing a few verses for them. In 1954, Ritchie released some of the British and Irish recordings on the album Field Trip, side by side with Ritchie family versions of the same songs; a broader selection was issued by Folkways on the two LPs Field Trip\u2013England (1959) and As I Roved Out (Field Trip\u2013Ireland) (1960).
