He was born in Warwick, and joined Formula One while employed by Harry Ferguson Research, developing four-wheel drive systems for Matra in 1969. He met Ken Tyrrell in 1970 and Tyrrell chose Gardner to design his chassis. The first chassis, the Tyrrell 001, was built in his garage at home and was raced in the 1970 Canadian Grand Prix.Jackie Stewart qualified the car on pole on its debut and led until an axle failed on lap 34. The car was further developed into the Tyrrell 002 and 003 and drivers Jackie Stewart and Fran\u00e7ois Cevert achieved seven wins between them in 1971. Stewart won the Drivers' World Championship and Tyrrell took the Constructors' title.\nGardner's most iconic car was the Tyrrell P34, commonly known as the \"six-wheeler\". The car used four specially manufactured 10-inch-diameter (254 mm) wheels and tyres at the front, with two ordinary-sized wheels at the back. Along with the Brabham BT46B \"fancar\" developed in 1978, the six-wheeled Tyrrell was one of the most radical entries ever to succeed in F1 competition, and has been called the most recognizable design in the history of world motorsports.\nGardner also designed boats, electric bikes and microlites during his long career as a designer. He died in Lutterworth, aged 79.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 19", "response": ["*  1931   \u2013 Derek Gardner, English engineer (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "Tyrrell P34", "response": ["The Tyrrell P34 (Project 34), commonly known as the \"six-wheeler\", was a Formula One (F1) race car designed by Derek Gardner, Tyrrell's chief designer.

The company they formed also pioneered the viscous coupling. This eventually led to backing from tractor magnate Harry Ferguson and gave rise to the development of the Ferguson P99 four-wheel drive F1 car. Rolt subsequently built Indianapolis 500 track-racing 4WD cars for the American STP Corporation, and Ferguson transmissions appeared in the Lotus 56, Novi-Ferguson and STP-Paxton Turbocar Indy Cars of 1964 to 1969. With the technical director Claude Hill and the project engineer Derek Gardner, Rolt was among the unsung backroom heroes of British racing development. When Ferguson Development closed, Rolt founded FF Developments in 1971, converting cars, vans and ambulances to four-wheel drive. During the 1980s, major automotive manufacturers finally saw advantages in all-wheel drive technology, and the company became a major technology partner of Ford, Chrysler, Audi, Fiat and General Motors."]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*7 January \u2013 Derek Gardner, racing car designer (b. 1931)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2011", "response": ["*Derek Gardner, 79, British vehicle and Formula One car designer."]}, {"page": "Derek Gardner (motorsport)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Derek Gardner (designer)"]}]}}
