In mid-November 2010, the withdrawal of Fluor resulted in the third consortium pulling out of the bidding process. The second consortium withdrew in June 2011 following the decision by Carillion not to continue. This led to the cancellation of the tender procedure by Scottish transport minister Keith Brown. Network Rail was chosen by Transport Scotland to undertake the project and, following months of negotiations, a Transfer of Responsibility was signed at a ceremony held on 6 November 2012 at the Scottish Mining Museum in Newtongrange. Network Rail agreed to build the line by mid-2015 for \u00a3294 million, an increase on the estimated \u00a3230 million that the line was expected to cost and the \u00a3100 million that it was originally costed at in 2000. This figure is also substantially more than the \u00a3189 million which Network Rail Chief Executive Iain Coucher agreed to build the line in late 2007 or early 2008."]}]}}
