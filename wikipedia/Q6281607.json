In his 30s, Booth abandoned his career as a businessman and, for the rest of his life, he undertook missionary work for several Christian denominations including Baptist, Seventh Day Baptist and Seventh-day Adventist churches, and he was appointed a missionary by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. Throughout his successive ministries, his defining beliefs were a radical egalitarianism, including a scheme of \"Africa for the Africans\"\u2019 and, from 1898, Seventh-Day Sabbath (Sabbatarian) observance.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "African Baptist Assembly of Malawi, Inc.", "response": ["The African Baptist Assembly of Malawi has its origins in an Australian mission of Joseph Booth, with the Zambezi Industrial Mission in 1892, which he convinced British Baptists to help finance. Owen J. M. Kalinga, Historical Dictionary of Malawi, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2012, p. 485 He was also involved in the Nyaza Industrial Mission (1893) and the Baptist Industrial Mission (1895). In 1897, Booth took Yao tribesman John Chilembwe (ca.1871-1915) to America, where the National Baptist Convention, USA sponsored his education at the Virginia Theological Seminary and College at Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1900 Chilembwe returned to Africa under the banner of the National Baptist Convention, USA and established the Providence Industrial Mission. Robert E. Johnson, A Global Introduction to Baptist Churches, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2010, p. 250 After Chilembwe was killed on February 4, 1915, while leading an uprising against British authority, the government banned the Providence Mission. Today the nation of Malawi regards and honors Chilembwe as a martyr. His face appears on the 200 Kwacha (Malawian currency)."]}, {"page": "John Chilembwe", "response": ["There is limited information about John Chilembwe's parentage and birth. An American pamphlet of 1914 claimed that John Chilembwe was born in Sangano, Chiradzulu District, in the south of what became Nyasaland, in June 1871. Joseph Booth also stated that Chilembwe's father was a Yao and his mother a Mang'anja slave, captured in warfare. This information was contemporary; in the 1990s, John Chilembwe's granddaughter stated that Chilembwe's father may have been called Kaundama, and was one of those who settled at Mangochi Hill during the Yao infiltration into Mang'anja territory, and that his mother may have been called Nyangu: his likely pre-baptismal name was Nkologo. However, other also quite recent sources give differing parental names.D T Stuart-Mogg, (1997).

Chilembwe attended a Church of Scotland mission from around 1890.", "=== Influence of Joseph Booth ===", "In 1892 he became a house servant of Joseph Booth, a radical and independent-minded missionary. Booth had arrived in Africa in 1892 as a Baptist to establish the Zambezi Industrial Mission near Blantyre. Booth was critical of the reluctance of Scottish Presbyterian missions to admit Africans as full church members, and later founded seven more independent missions in Nyasaland which, like the Zambezi Industrial Mission, focused on the equality of all worshippers. In Booth's household and mission, where he was closely associated with Booth, Chilembwe became acquainted with Booth's radical religious ideas and egalitarian feelings.G. Shepperson and T.
