He decreed at the outset of war that \"no further action should be taken against the Evangelical and Catholic Churches for the duration of the war\".

Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933-1945; Regent College Publishing; p.\u00a0234 No denunciations of the invasion of Poland, or the Blitzkrieg were issued.

They urged their Catholic followers to \"fulfill their duty to the Fuhrer\". Nazi war actions in 1940 and 1941 similarly prompted the Church to voice its support. The bishops declared that the Church \"assents to the just war, especially one designed for the safeguarding of the state and the people\" and wants a \"peace beneficial to Germany and Europe\" and calls the faithful to \"fulfill their civil and military virtues.\" But the Nazis strongly disapproved of the sentiments against war expressed by the Pope through his first encyclical, Summi Pontificatus and his 1939 Christmas message, and they were angered by his support for Poland and the \"provocative\" use of Vatican Radio by Cardinal Hlond of Poland. Distribution of the encyclical was banned.John S.

Monasteries and convents were targeted and expropriations of Church properties surged. The Nazi authorities claimed that the properties were needed for wartime necessities such as hospitals, or accommodations for refugees or children, but they instead used them for their own purposes. \"Hostility to the state\" was another common cause given for the confiscations, and the actions of a single member of a monastery could result in the seizure of the whole. The Jesuits were especially targeted.John S.

In the first chapter of The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, historian John S.
