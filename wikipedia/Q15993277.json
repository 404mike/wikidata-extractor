He was right-handed batsman who fielded as a wicket-keeper. He was born at Portsmouth, Hampshire.  Debuting for Hampshire County Cricket Club in 1932, McCorkell played first-class cricket for Hampshire in two periods, from 1932 to 1939, then after World War II from 1946 to 1951.  Statistically he ended his first-class career as Hampshire's  most successful wicket-keeper in first-class cricket, with 677 dismissals, although Bobby Parks later overtook that total. Following his retirement he emigrated to South Africa, where he still resided until his death.  In 2012, he became the 16th first-class cricketer to reach 100 years of age.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 23", "response": ["*  1912   \u2013 Neil McCorkell, English-South African cricketer and coach (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "Adrian Aymes", "response": ["He is considered by the Hampshire Cricket Society to be the best wicket-keeper to wear the gloves regularly.\"Adi Aymes \u2013 Hampshire's best Wicketkeeper/Batsman? \", cricketarchive.

Although Bobby Parks made the most dismissals (700), and Neil McCorkell (between 1932 and 1951) scored the most runs (15,834, including the five highest scores by a Hampshire 'keeper), Aymes is considered to combine the two skills to the greatest effect. McCorkell passed the benchmark '1000 runs in a season' 9 times, a feat Aymes failed to match.
