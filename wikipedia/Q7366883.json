He signed Dungannon Swifts winger David Scullion along with Rory Hamill. McDonald also brought in young promising players, including Daryl Fordyce, Philip Carson, Matty Burrows, and Shane McCabe. He also added goalkeeper Michael Dougherty as backup to Elliott Morris, and brought in Hearts defender Johnny Taylor. In his first full season as manager of the East Belfast club, McDonald led Glentoran to win the County Antrim Shield over Crusaders. In McDonald's second season, he led the club to become Irish Premiership champions after four years. During his second season McDonald continued to bring in new faces, after selling Michael Dougherty, McDonald brought in Dundela keeper James Taylor. In his third season in charge McDonald started by signing former Northern Ireland international Keith Gillespie and Newry City player Richard Clarke. But Glentoran went on a losing streak, and after a 6\u20130 home defeat to Coleraine, fans turned against McDonald and calling for him to resign.
