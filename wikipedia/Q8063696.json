Steve Whitehall was sold to Rochdale A.F.C. in 1991 for a club record \u00a325,000. Carl Baker was the next player to be sold for a large sum of money and in the process smashed the previous club record, moving to Morecambe in July 2007 for a reputed \u00a350,000. Craig Noone moved to Plymouth Argyle for an undisclosed fee that could eventually rise to a new club record in excess of \u00a3100,000 despite never playing a competitive game for the club. In May 2009 Morecambe raided Southport again, signing Mark Duffy for \u00a320,000 after a short loan spell. Zac Aley moved to Blackburn Rovers for an undisclosed fee in February 2010, however it is believed the club would reap the benefits financially if he establishes himself as a first team player."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|  Zac Aley"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Zac Aley", "| Zac Aley"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Macclesfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Zac Aley"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|  Zac Aley"]}]}}
