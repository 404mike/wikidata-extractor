He made 25 further first-class appearances for the county, the last of which came against Essex in the 1958 County Championship.  In his 26 first-class matches for Sussex, he scored a total of 150 runs at an average of 6.00, with a high score of 34.  Behind the stumps he took 28 catches and made 2 stumpings.  Mantell found his opportunities limited, and when the regular Sussex wicketkeeper Rupert Webb announced he would retire from full-time cricket at the end of the 1958 season, Sussex encouraged Jim Parks, a far better batsman than Mantell, to take up wicketkeeping; that led Mantell to leave the county at the end of the 1958 season."]}, {"page": "Webb (surname)", "response": ["*Rupert Webb (1922\u20132018), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Rupert Webb (1959) : R.
