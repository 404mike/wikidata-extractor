Pullar had been brought in as a specialist opener instead of Cowdrey, who had been England's makeshift opener against Pakistan in 1962, but disliked the job and had made three successive ducks in this role so far on the tour. David Allen was dropped to make way for the extra batsman and Ray Illingworth in favour of Fred Titmus, but this was quite normal as these three off-spinners regularly displaced each other depending on current form and favour. Wicket-keeper John Murray was replaced by debutant Alan Smith due to his superior batting on tour, even though he too had been hit on the head by a Wes Hall bouncer the week before. Fast bowlers Len Coldwell and David Larter had been tried out in the Fifth Test against Pakistan at the Oval, but the old firm of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham were back in action, even though Trueman had a broken bone in his back and had been told by an Australian doctor that he would never bowl again.p282, Trueman", "The bowling began poorly, but after 20 minutes Fred Trueman (3/76) got the hang of the pitch and made the ball swing away from Bill Lawry, finding a thin edge to Alan Smith for his first catch in Test cricket. Norm O'Neill was a notoriously poor starter and would have run himself out if Ted Dexter had gathered the ball cleanly. As it was he edged Trueman to David Sheppard at second clip, who missed the catch and Peter Parfitt dropped the rebound for what would have been a superlative diving catch he held on. After cutting the ball for a scorching boundary, edging another past fine-leg and glancing another, O'Neill was out to a Trueman bouncer which lifted sharply and he was caught by Brian Statham at short square-leg for 19. Bobby Simpson made 50, but mis-hooked a rank long hop from Dexter (1/46) into the hands of Trueman at mid-on and Australia went into lunch on 97/3. Back on the field Trueman started bowling short on the leg-stump, dubbed \"bodyline\" by some journalists, and Peter Burge popped a ball to Dexter at short-leg to give the Yorkshireman his third wicket despite his bad back. Australia were now surprisingly 101/4, but Brian Booth (112) rebuilt the innings, adding 39 with Neil Harvey (39), 54 with Alan Davidson (23) and 103 the ever solid Ken Mackay. A rather lifeless Statham (1/75) bowled Harvey with a good ball, but it was the support bowlers Barry Knight, Fred Titmus and Ken Barrington who suffered in the afternoon as the fast bowlers were given a rest. Smith missed a stumping when Booth was 21 and tried to drive Titmus and also hit the spinner to the boundary over the head of a fielder. Davidson heaved Titmus to the fence, but tried the same to Barrington's leg-spin and was caught by Trueman, who had now taken three wickets and held two catches out of six dismissals. The game struggled in the final session, with Dexter setting defensive fields to Titmus and Knight and Mackay hogging the strike without making runs and too slow to take quick singles which would have upset the field-placings. Booth reached his \"wristily stylish\"p298, Ray Robinson and Mike Coward, England vs Australia 1932\u20131985, Barclays World of Cricket, Willow Books, 1986 maiden Test century in 173 minutes and with 14 fours, an aristocratic innings by the man who had nearly been left carrying the drinks. He was caught by Dexter off Titmus (1/91) at 20 minutes to six trying to push the score in the face of all opposition. His departure at 296/7 brought in captain Richie Benaud, who must have wondered if his team would make 300 earlier in the day, but saw Australia to 321/7 by stumps, with Mackay reaching 51 not out. Trueman was fit to bowl in the morning, but Benaud hooked him for four and with Mackay took 11 runs off an over by Statham. When five overs had gone for 34 runs so Titmus and Knight were brought back on to defensive fields. Benaud made 51 runs before he edged the ball to Smith off Knight at 388/8. Knight (3/65) made two dives across the wicket to take return catches off Mackay, which he dropped and McKenzie, which he held on to. Jarman was caught off the Essex all-rounder by Barrington to wrap up the Australian innings for 404 in time for an early lunch, with Mackay left high and dry on 86 not out. It was his own fault as the dour Queenslander had occupied his home ground for a tedious 247 minutes, had refused singles and had allowed Dexter to contain him. Mackay never made a Test century and this was the closest he got to one against England.pp. 43\u201348, Moyespp. 99\u2013100, Titmus", "England's innings was more solid than Australia's \u2013 the first seven batsmen made 21 and three passed 50 \u2013 but fell 15 runs short in the first innings. Geoff Pullar (33) and David Sheppard (31) struggled along with Sheppard edging a ball to the ground near Alan Davidson and Pullar caught by Richie Benaud only for Barry Jarman to signal that it was not a chance. Benaud had both men floundering at times, but they stuck to their work until Benaud caught Pullar off his own bowling on 62/1 and had Sheppard taken round the corner by Garth McKenzie for 65/2. This brought Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey the crease to see out the session. After tea Dexter sent the ball crashing to the boundary ten times as he and his vice-captain added 80 runs in 76 minutes. Cowdrey (21) was willing to watch until he hooked Bobby Simpson straight into the hands of Bill Lawry and at ten to six Dexter's confidence \u2013 and the lengthening shadows \u2013 got the better of him and he drove over a ball from Benaud and was bowled for 70. Alan Smith joined Ken Barrington as a nightwatchman and they saw the day end on 169/4. Barrington thrashed six boundaries off Benaud and Simpson (1/52) in his first 25 runs the next day, adding 51 with Smith (21), who was caught behind when Garth McKenzie was brought into the attack and made several balls left awkwardly off the pitch. Barrington now reverted to his typical, grinding self, taking 210 minutes over his last 40 runs with Peter Parfitt feeling his way to 80 off 244 minutes. Finally the Surrey batsman lost his concentration and skied Benaud to Peter Burge at mid-off for 78 and was replaced by the equally pedestrian Fred Titmus, who prodded his way to 21 in 104 minutes. The end came suddenly, Titmus and Parfitt were caught off Benaud (6/115), McKenzie (3/78) had Barry Knight out for a duck and Fred Trueman for 19 after he hit a six and 2 fours adding 27 runs in 20 minutes for the last wicket with Brian Statham as 361/6 became 362/9 and 389 all out.pp. 48\u201351, Moyes and Goodman", "Fred Trueman (0/59) gave Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry a torrid time, his first ball to Simpson rolled onto the stumps, but failed to dislodge the bail and they survived the day with 16/0. They moved along to 104 by lunch, but not without a few scares. Brian Statham missed a simple caught and bowled off Simpson and Trueman's strong left arm nearly had Lawry run out while backing up. Simpson had made 109, 66 not out, 28, 122, 130, 9, 110 and 50 so far in the season and looked tired when he edged Ted Dexter (2/78) behind to the vigilant England wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 71 in a stand of 136. Norm O'Neill came in and promptly drove Dexter for 4, then hooked him for another. He took a boundary off Barry Knight and even Lawry joined in the act, hooking Statham to the boundary as they added 80 runs in 79 minutes. Knight was reduced to bowling down the leg-side without a slip and O'Neill hooked to the boundary and smashed him over mid-on, which even brought applause from Dexter. Lawry moved smoothly to 98 then hooked a long hop from Fred Titmus (1/81) into the hands of David Sheppard in the deep. Neil Harvey came out to attack the bowling \u2013 he rarely did anything else \u2013 and the runs flowed regardless of Dexter's attempts to plug the gaps. O'Neill was out to a beautiful ball from Statham (1/67) that cut back and had him lbw for 56 with 9 fours and Harvey's 57 with 6 fours ended when he tried to hit Dexter out of the ground and was caught by Statham at deep mid-off. Peter Burge (47 not out) had kept Harvey company in a stand of 84, and added 37 runs with Brian Booth (19 not out) in the last half-hour and Australia were 362/4, 377 runs ahead by the end of the fourth day. Benaud's decision to not declare and have a bowl that evening was criticised by the press and several theories were advanced as to why. Some thought he was playing mind-games with the English batsmen, giving them an uncertain and nervous night, others that he was afraid of Dexter's batting power. A more likely explanation was that Benaud had suffered a groin strain after his 42 over marathon in the first innings and he did not want to declare until he knew he would be fit on the last day. In any case after inspecting the wicket with Neil Harvey and bowling a few balls in front of the pavilion he declared ten minutes before play started. England were given 378 runs to win, a total that they have yet to make in a fourth innings against Australia.pp. 305\u2013307, E.W. Swanton (ed), England vs Australia 1932\u20131985, Barclays World of Cricket, Willow Books, 1986", "Australia kept an unchanged XI for the Second Test, but England made two changes; Peter Parfitt was replaced by the veteran Tom Graveney who had made 122 not out against South Australia and Barry Knight by Len Coldwell who had taken 6/49 in the MCC's 5-wicket win over Victoria. Parfitt had been in poor form all tour except for the slow 80 he made in the First Test, though being used as a makeshift opener had not helped. Graveney was an old hand who had toured in 1954\u201355 and 1958\u201359, while Coldwell was proving to be a better bowler than Knight, whose only advantage was that he was an all-rounder, but in a team that still had eight recognised batsman this was not too much of a loss. Alan Smith was still preferred as wicket-keeper to John Murray, though not so much as to be \"the mystery of the tour\"p81, Moyes and Goodman as though Murray was the better keeper the difference in ability was minor. Brian Statham (231), Richie Benaud (226) and Fred Trueman (219) were all approaching Alec Bedser's record of 236 Test wickets. Bedser was in Australia as England's assistant-manager, as were the only other bowlers to have taken 200 Test wickets; Clarrie Grimmett (216), whose Test record had been overtaken by Bedser in 1953, and Ray Lindwall (228), who held the Australian record. Richie Benaud won the toss again and had no hesitation in batting first.pp. 78\u201382, Moyes and Goodman", "Bill Lawry (52) and Bobby Simpson (38) weathered the early storm of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham, edging a few through the slips and Trueman bowling out-swingers which moved just past the edge of the bat. Len Coldwell (2/58) came on the bowl his in-swingers, off which the openers managed to steal a few singles, until he managed to move the ball the other way and caught the edge of Simpson's bat for a catch behind at 62/1. Norm O'Neill came in until lunch when Australia went in on 93/1 off 22 overs in two hours, a total somewhat less than 15 overs an hour promised by Ted Dexter at the start of the tour. After lunch Lawry edged a ball from Statham between the wicket-keeper Alan Smith and Tom Graveney at first slip, the ball cutting back after it hit the turf. O'Neill was caught by Graveney off Statham (1/83), distracted by the loud racing commentary on a radio in the stands, Neil Harvey was bowled by Coldwell for a duck and Lawry by Trueman (3/83) and Australia lost three wickets for 1 run to be left 112/4. The rest of the innings was a grinding match as Dexter rested his fast bowlers and set defensive field until they returned and while all of the remaining Australian batsmen reached double figures none reached 50. Fred Titmus took his new best Test figures of 4/43 as he wheeled his way through the afternoon, trapping Peter Burge lbw for 23 when he swept once too often and having Brian Booth caught by Ken Barrington for 27 trying to repeat a fine glance to leg. Alan Davidson (40) and Ken Mackay (49) added 73 for the eighth-wicket and Mackay and Richie Benaud (36) 52 runs into the next day as they tried to wear down the bowlers. Titmus dismissed them both in the end, Benaud sweeping the ball the Barrington and Mackay lbw after some deliberation by Umpire Smyth. Trueman removed Garth McKenzie (16) after a last-wicket stand of 22 and Australia were all out for 316 with Barry Jarman on 10 not out.pp. 81\u201386, Moyes and Goodmanpp. 122\u2013123, Swanton", "Alan Davidson came down from the pavilion end like a man possessed and bowled with great pace, far more than his controlled fast-medium. David Sheppard was caught in front of the wicket lbw for 0, Ted Dexter's off-stump was missed by a coat of varnish and Geoff Pullar was bowled through the gate. Colin Cowdrey came in at 19/2, but with bags of confidence after hitting 307 (with 4 sixes and 29 fours) against South Australia, his highest first-class score and the best by a tourist in Australia. Together Dexter and Cowdrey withstood Davidson's burst of speed, the other bowlers failed to trouble them and by stealing quick ones, twos and threes they rebuilt the innings. Occasionally Dexter would strike out and at the end of a long, hot day he gave Bobby Simpson a catch of Benaud (1/82) and was out for 93, his third missed century in three innings. The stand had made 175 runs and the unluckiest bowler was Norm O'Neill (0/19) who had Cowdrey dropped on 56 and dropped a hard-hit return from Dexter on 89. Cowdrey ended the day on 94 not out with Ken Barrington on 11, England 210/3 \u2013 still 106 runs behind \u2013 and the game very much in the balance. They returned the next day and Cowdrey made his third and highest century in Australia, having made 102 in Melbourne in 1954\u201355 and 100 not out in Sydney in 1958\u201359. The celebrations were short lived when Cowdrey (113) hooked into the hands of Peter Burge off Garth McKenzie, who then had Barrington (35) was lbw to a ball that cut back. Tom Graveney might have given England a real lead, but his was run out by a cracking throw from Neil Harvey for 41 and the last 4 wickets fell for 16 runs as Davidson (6/75) returned the clean up the tail; Fred Titmus caught behind, Fred Trueman skying the ball to O'Neill, Brian Statham having his stumps turned over and Len Coldwell edging to Benaud in the gully.

Bill Lawry and Bobby Simpson hit 30 runs in 34 minutes when the top of the innings crashed. Simpson had his middle stump removed by a Fred Trueman yorker and on the next ball Norm O'Neill was snatched in the slips by Colin Cowdrey after the ball had gone past him. This was not a novel experience, four years before he had been caught by the same fielder, in the same position, off the same bowler, on the same ground for the same first ball duck. Neil Harvey came in for the hat-trick and drove the ball for two, but went for a fourth run and had his wicket thrown down by Geoff Pullar, Peter Burge was bowled by Brian Statham (2/52) and Australia were 69/4 \u2013 only 54 runs ahead. Lawry was dropped off a difficult one handed chance to David Sheppard before stumps and Australia came in with 105/4. Lawry (57) and Brian Booth (103) stayed into lunch the next day, the angular Victorian left-hander dominating the strike and made no effort to make runs before his was torpedoed by round-arm Ted Dexter shooter with the last ball of the morning, having made 16 runs in the last two hours. Booth struggled towards his century as Fred Titmus bowled with a leg-side field to cut off his strokes and the off-spinner had Alan Davidson caught by the keeper Alan Smith before Trueman returned with a new-ball spell either side of tea. He removed Richie Benaud, Ken Mackay and Garth McKenzie for 6 runs in 15 balls in what David Sheppard called \"the finest sustained and accurate fast bowling I have ever seen\".p. 280, Trueman Barry Jarman hung around for Booth to both reach his century and to be caught by Trueman off Statham. Australia were all out for 248, leaving England to make 234 to win in just over a day.pp88-91, Moyes and Goodmanpp109-110, Titmus", "Regardless of the advice of his bowlers Ted Dexter preferred to continue with the successful bowling attack from Melbourne, and may have been swayed by the Australians who dropped Peter Burge and Ken Mackay in favour of debutants Barry Shepherd and Colin Guest. Mackay was a loyal \u2013 if dour \u2013 servant of Australia and a great man in a crisis, but public opinion was vocal against his stonewalling and he and Burge were unfairly blamed for the defeat at Melbourne. The inclusion of the energetic captain of Western Australia pleased the England team, who had tried to play him into the Tests, but kept getting him out. Colin Guest was a fast-medium bowler who was brought in to support Alan Davidson and Garth McKenzie instead of Mackay. That Richie Benaud was content with three pace bowlers and the leg-spin of himself and Bobby Simpson on his home ground signalled that the wicket was not as flat as Trueman thought. Dexter was never a man to favour spinners and was disinclined to include the out-of-form David Allen or Ray Illingworth in the team. John Murray's neatness behind the stumps was finally recognised and he replaced the much criticised Alan Smith as wicket-keeper.  Peter Parfitt was back in the England team as Tom Graveney had picked up a viral infection.pp. 101\u2013102, Moyes and Goodmanpp. 124\u2013125, Swantonpp. 102\u2013103, Titmus", "The Adelaide Oval is traditionally a dull, lifeless wicket with bounce so low that even the fastest bowlers rarely rise it above stump height and batsmen found it difficult to get the ball away. On this occasion frequent light rain helped freshen it up slightly for the pacemen and it resolutely refused to turn. England dropped their injured wicket-keeper John Murray and Alan Smith returned to the team. Tom Graveney was well again and replaced the out of form Peter Parfitt and the off-spinner Ray Illingworth was brought in for the fast-medium bowler Len Coldwell. Once again Fred Trueman advised the opposite, he thought an extra seamer would be better at Adelaide, but was ignored; in any case the spinners struggled on a pitch that refused to turn. Typically the selectors chose the out of form Illingworth over David Allen because of his superior batting. Barry Jarman was also dropped as Australia's first choice keeper Wally Grout was fit to play against after breaking his jaw in November and the paceman Colin Guest was dropped in favour of Ken Mackay in what would be his final Test. Richie Benaud now had 228 Test wickets, Fred Trueman 229 and Brian Statham 235, just one behind Alec Bedser's Test record of 236. Richie Benaud won the toss for the third time and chose to bat.pp. 117\u2013121, Moyes and Goodmanpp. 125\u2013127, Swanton", "Fred Trueman opened the bowling and soon had Bill Lawry writhing as he made the ball lift off the rain-freshed wicket, but it was Brian Statham who struck first. He had Bobby Simpson out first ball, caught behind by wicket-keeper Alan Smith for a first ball duck to match Alec Bedser's record of 236 Test wickets. Ted Dexter crowded close fielders round the batsmen as Trueman and Statham continued their attack, but he noticed that their footmarks were indenting the soft pitch and after 45 minutes he replaced Trueman with Ray Illingworth and Statham with Fred Titmus. They failed to turn the ball, it would not turn throughout the match, but the Yorkshireman almost had 3 wickets for 1 run. Lawry was bowled for 10, Illingworth (1/85) coming round the wicket with a straight ball to remove his off-stump. Neil Harvey had just made 231 not out against South Australia, his last innings in the Sheffield Shield, and was full of confidence. On 11 he snicked the ball to slip where Colin Cowdrey dropped a sharp chance and swung the following ball was to square-leg, where David Sheppard dropped an easy chance. On 26 he gave Cowdrey another chance in the slips, the waist-high ball dropped with his left hand off Dexter. Cowdrey finally took a catch to remove Brian Booth (34) off Titmus (2/88) after lunch for 101/3, but England failed to dismiss the out of form Norm O'Neill when he pushed a ball from Titmus close to Dexter's left hand at square-leg. Having survived Harvey and O'Neill set about the English bowling in the most attractive batting of the entire series. They added 194 for the fourth-wicket in 171 minutes and at five runs an over. O'Neill swept Titmus to the boundary, followed by two drives to either side of the wicket, and more from cuts through gully and point. Harvey danced down the wicket to hit Titmus for four three times in an over, and became the fourth batsman to pass 6,000 Test runs after Wally Hammond, Don Bradman and Len Hutton. He drove Illingworth through the covers in the last over before tea to bring up his 21st Test century, his 6th against England. But Dexter kept the suffering spinners on until the new ball arrived after tea. Trueman and Statham were exhausted and made no impression with the new ball, so Dexter bowled himself with Illingworth chipping in with medium-paced seamers from his youth. At the end of the day the tired batsmen gave themselves out to the tired fieldsmen, O'Neill reached his century in 169 minutes, the fastest of the series, with 14 boundaries, but was caught for 100 by Cowdrey off Dexter (3/94). Harvey cut the ball to Cowdrey off the England captain for 154 with 18 boundaries to leave Australia 302/5. Alan Davidson and Barry Shepherd took them to 322/5 overnight, but the England bowlers recovered in the morning and Australia crashed to 393 all out, losing their last 5 wickets for 71 runs. Brian Statham (3/66) had Shepherd caught in the gully by Trueman for his record 237th wicket to become the biggest wicket-taker in Test cricket. Trueman (1/54) had Ken Mackay caught behind by an agile Smith, Richie Benaud was bowled by Dexter, Davidson (46) was bowled by Statham and the unsafe hands of David Sheppard held onto a long, high skier from Garth McKenzie in the deep.pp120-123, Moyes and Goodmanp. 299, Ray Robinson and Mike Coward, England vs Australia 1932\u20131985, Barclays World of Cricket, Willow Books, 1986", "England came in to bat in the afternoon and Geoff Pullar did not play his bat to a Garth McKenzie in-swinger and was clean-bowled for 7. Ken Barrington came in instead of Ted Dexter, who was resting after bowling 23 overs in the Australian innings. Barrington lacked his usual assurance and mishit Alan Davidson three times to the boundary on successive balls before hitting him again with the fourth ball, after which Davidson retired with a torn thigh muscle. David Sheppard (30) was stumped by Wally Grout trying to drive Richie Benaud (1/82), giving the captain his 229th Test wicket to pass Ray Lindwall and become Australia's greatest Test wicket-taker. England reached tea with 87/2, but Barrington (63) was bowled by the first ball from Bobby Simpson (1/40) and McKenzie (5/89) removed Colin Cowdrey caught behind (though he thought that it had hit the grass) and Tom Graveney to Brian Booth at leg-slip. Dexter was now left with Fred Titmus at 165/5, but the England captain fought back by driving Simpson to the fence, lifting him for six twice in an over and reaching his 50 off McKenzie in the last over of the day. There was rain on the rest day and the morning of Australia Day, which earned the South Australian Cricket Association \u00a33,000 in insurance and helped bind the wicket, enabling the fast bowlers to lift the ball, but preventing the pitch from breaking up or taking spin. Play began at 1:45 pm with Titmus unsuccessfully appealing against the light and glancing the ball past the seagulls and bird-fancier Bill Lawry at the cathedral end. They played on in a light drizzle and Titmus hit Benaud and Mackay for fours, but when Dexter tried the same against McKenzie he was caught by leaping wicket-keeper off a rising ball. The wet outfield made the ball damp and heavy, and thus useless to spinners, so McKenzie bowled unchanged from the river end except for one over before taking the new ball. With Davidson still absent Ken Mackay took over from the other end. Ray Illingworth gave Grout his fourth dismissal of the innings, and his third catch off McKenzie and Alan Smith skied Mackay to Lawry to reduce England to 275/8. Fred Trueman joined Fred Titmus and \"The Fighting Freds\" thumped 52 runs in 37 minutes. Trueman hit Mackay for four, heaved his first ball from Benaud into the stands and appealed for light. When this was turned down he hit Benaud to the leg boundary for four and over long-on for another six, followed by a four off Mackay before the ball flew off the shoulder of his bat to Benaud at mid-on to be out for 38, one short of his highest Test score. Titmus made his first Test 50, but was given the light and the last 45 minutes were lost, three hours in the day. Mackay (3/80) bowled Brian Statham in the second over of the fourth day to have England out for 331, 62 runs behind Australia. Titmus was left on 59 not out to give him an average of 200.00 at the Adelaide Oval.pp. 123\u2013126, Moyes and Goodmanpp. 115, Titmus", "The out of form Bill Lawry hung on grimly for an hour for 16 runs before he was caught in the slips by Tom Graveney off Fred Trueman, who took advantage of the freshened pitch and hit Bobby Simpson with a nasty rising ball. Neil Harvey cut Brian Statham for four and was caught by Ken Barrington in the gully when he tried it off the next ball. This left Australia 42/2 at lunch, but Simpson and Brian Booth added 86 runs in the afternoon session and opened up after tea. Booth hit Fred Titmus for six and overtook Simpson despite his 75-minute start. Their stand was ended in an eventful over from Ted Dexter (3/65); a diving Barrington missed Booth on the first ball, and the batsmen ran a single; Simpson was caught behind on the second ball, having made 71 in 237 minutes, Norm O'Neill took a single off the third ball and Booth hit a boundary off the fifth ball only to be taken by wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 77 with the last ball of the over. Dexter struck again before stumps, Barry Shepherd spooning a catch to Titmus at wide mid-off and Trueman had Ken Mackay caught at slip by Graveney in his last over with the old ball. O'Neill and Richie Benaud saw out the new ball and Australia finished the day at 225/6, a lead of 287 runs. Trueman and Statham fired down the new ball in the morning, but Titmus dropped Benaud on the first ball of the day. O'Neill was out to Trueman, caught by Cowdrey at slip, and Garth McKenzie became Smith's fifth catch of the match, taken off Statham. Alan Davidson came in for 14 balls before he was bowled by Statham (3/71) and Benaud and Wally Grout added 35 for the last wicket before the captain was caught for 48 by Barrington off Trueman (4/60). Benaud had refused to declare before lunch and make a game of it, but with the Ashes at stake and Davidson unable to bowl he dared not take the risk. As it was Australia made 293, setting England 356 to win in just over four hours.pp. 126\u2013129, Moyes and Goodman", "With Geoff Pullar unable to play Colin Cowdrey opened for England again, a role he did not relish and after making two runs he was out, mis-hitting a ball from Alan Davidson to Neil Harvey at backward short-leg, who darted forward to take it at grass height. David Sheppard became Neil Hawke's first Test wicket, catching a full blooded cover drive off his own bowling. This made England 39/2 after 108 minutes and with Ken Barrington entrenched at one end the crowd were looked to Ted Dexter to produce some excitement. The wicket was dead and the sky was clear, so there was no chance of the ball swinging and the famous Sydney Hill was becoming restless, Barrington raising his cap when he was jeered and a slow hand clap started around the ground as Dexter played himself in. This was briefly curtailed when Barrington glanced a full toss from Garth McKenzie for four and Dexter hit three fours off Bobby Simpson. Norm O'Neill caught Barrington on the pads and appealed, but no else joined in and the Englishman stayed put. Australia were running through 14\u201315 overs an hour, the fastest so far in the series, but with such defensive play the effort was wasted. Dexter was out after lunch edging O'Neill (1/38) to Simpson at first slip for 47 and Tom Graveney almost went the same way to Benaud. At 5:15 pm the batsmen appealed for light, but were turned down and five minutes later he glanced McKenzie (1/57) off his legs, but \"Harvey, anticipating, shot out his left hand; he somersaulted and momentarily stood on his head, then he rolled over and sat up, still clutching the ball.\"p. 147, Moyes and Goodman Barrington usually woke up when his century was in sight, and a sweep of Simpson was dropped by Brian Booth, but a drive found its way to the boundary and a single brought up his hundred and a surprisingly generous round of applause from the stadium. He drove Benaud straight to Harvey in the covers, who bruised a finger taking his third catch, out for 101 after 320 minutes. Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus lasted until stumps, with England 195/5 after a full day's play. The second day continued in the same dull way, or perhaps worse as only three boundaries were hit between the two sides. Illingworth (27) and Titmus (34) produced, long, slow innings occasionally interrupted by drizzle before they were both caught by Wally Grout, one off Davidson and the other off Hawke (2/57). Even Fred Trueman played a subdued innings before he was caught by Harvey off Benaud for 30. Alan Smith was bowled by Simpson (1/51) and David Allen and Brian Statham finally livened things up with a last wicket stand of 28 in 35 minutes until Benaud caught Allen off Davidson (3/43). England's 321 had taken them nine and a half hours, an innings more akin to saving a lost cause than trying to win a match.pp. 145\u2013149, Moyes and Goodman", "Australia had less need than England to increase the scoring rate as a draw would save the Ashes, but the burden of batting last meant that they should overhaul England's total by 50 runs because of the danger of being spun out on the last day. Bill Lawry and Bobby Simpson looked keen enough with 28 runs in the first half-hour even though Fred Trueman hit Simpson on the shoulder with a beamer. He had Lawry caught behind for 12 and welcomed Brian Booth with a bouncer and a yorker that nearly bowled him, followed by a lbw appeal from Brian Statham. After this it was the turn of the spinners Fred Titmus and David Allen who bowled 90 over between them in the innings at a rate of 16\u201317 an hour and with great accuracy. Titmus bowled Booth in his second over, appealed for leg before wicket against Norm O'Neill before he had scored and had Simpson caught by Trueman at leg-slip to give him 2/10 off 8 overs and to leave Australia 71/3. Neil Harvey had been lowered down the order because of his bruise finger and Peter Burge came out for a few minutes before play ended at 5:38 pm. In the Sunday press conference Ted Dexter thought that England would have a good chance of winning and that three days would be enough to force a win, a minority view. On the Monday morning O'Neill was full of confidence after his century at Adelaide and refused to be tied town, or to submit to the flat wicket. He struck 6 fours in the morning session, and Burge 3, compared to the miserly 3 boundaries made on Saturday. He cause was helped by England's shoddy fielding, wicket-keeper Alan Smith failed to stump O'Neill off Allen on 70 and dropped Burge off Statham on 63. O'Neill went after lunch, driving Allen into the outstretched hand of Tom Graveney at short mid-on for 73, having added 109 with Burge. This brought Neil Harvey to the crease in his farewell Test on his home ground to great applause and welcomed by the England team, as was Alan Davidson. Rain now interfered with play and there were two 20\u201325 minutes breaks, which upset his concentration, even so he added 51 with Burge before being caught by the substitute fielder Peter Parfitt off Statham (1/76) for 22, Colin Cowdrey being off the field with an eye infection and Trueman was off with a strained thigh. Dexter (1/24) tried to bowl around the wicket to Davidson, who had tried to have the sightscreen moved over, only to find that it could not go that far to the left, so Dexter went back to bowling over the wicket, but the palaver had unsettled the batsman and he holed out to Allen. Richie Benaud hit a Dexter bouncer to the boundary and dominated the strike for the last two overs to make 13 not out, leaving Burge on 98 and Australia 285/5, still 36 runs behind. Burge took four overs to reach his hundred the next morning, in slower time than Barrington, and was lbw trying to sweep Titmus for 103. Garth McKenzie was caught and bowled by Titmus, but Neil Hawke hung on for an hour adding 44 with Benaud (57) before they were both caught by Graveney to give Titmus 5/103 off 47.2 overs and Allen 2/87 off 43 overs. The Australians were not riled so much by the crowd as the English batsmen had been, partly as O'Neill and Benaud had been making strokes, but also by the interest in seeing whether they could lead in the first innings. This they did, a total of 349 giving a slim lead of 28 runs.pp. 149\u2013153, Moyes and Goodman", "England began their second innings after an early lunch taken on the fourth day, David Sheppard and Ray Illingworth making 40, the highest English first-wicket stand since the first Test. Alan Davidson bowled unchanged for two hours, bowling medium-paced cutters off a long run up to waste time. Garth McKenzie bowled one over and Neil Hawke two before they were replaced by Richie Benaud, bowling into a cold breeze which saw most of the crowd depart. Sheppard was dropped by a sleepy McKenzie at fine short-leg, where the excellent Norm O'Neill had just been taken off with another throat infection. Benaud (3/71) took the first three wickets. Illingworth (18) driving the ball to Hawke in the covers, Sheppard (68), lifting the ball to Neil Harvey for his fifth catch of the game and Ted Dexter (6) who was stumped trying to hit his opposite number over the fence. Ken Barrington had played a watchful innings from the other end, adding 97 with Sheppard, and Colin Cowdrey ended the day at 165/3 after four hours, a lead of 137 over Australia with one day's play left. Quick runs were vital for setting up a victory \u2013 Dexter had vowed to declare at lunch come what may \u2013  and Cowdrey brought up his 50 with two boundaries and a three, but edged the new ball off Davidson to Benaud at second slip after making 53 in a stand of 94. Barrington touched a rising ball from McKenzie to Wally Grout for a 94 that contained only two fours. It was his fourth consecutive Test 50 and he would make 126 and 76 in New Zealand to equal the record of Patsy Hendren made in 1928\u201329 and Ted Dexter at the beginning of the series. Davidson (3/80) picked up Tom Graveney and Alan Smith and McKenzie (2/39) dismissed Fred Trueman when he hit two fours and gave Harvey his sixth catch of the game with his last ball in Test cricket. Lunch was taken and Dexter declared, England had collapsed from 239/3 to 268/8 and this gave his bowlers four hours to take 10 wickets for 240 runs.pp. 153\u2013156, Moyes and Goodman", "Richie Benaud may have been prepared to go for the runs, but Fred Trueman (1/6) bowled Bobby Simpson with his fifth ball and Bill Lawry dug himself in to make 18 not out in the two hours between lunch and tea. Neil Harvey came in at number three, but struggled to 28 when he was bowled by well flighted ball from David Allen. Norm O'Neill took 17 minutes to open his score, cut two fours off Ken Barrington and another off Fred Titmus until he tried to force a ball down the off-side and was caught by Alan Smith off Allen, who then bowled Brian Booth with a shooter for a duck and Australia went into tea at 75/4 with Allen on 3/23. During tea Benaud told Lawry and Burge to \"stay in\" and they needed little encouragement to do so. Lawry dragged out his innings to 45 not out in four hours regardless of cat-calls, hoots, jeers and the rattling of beer-cans.

Bobby Simpson had just returned to New South Wales, but they had hired the formidable Tony Lock after the MCC declined to bring him on tour and this was his debut. Lock was the famous Surrey spin twin of Jim Laker, a Slow Left Arm Bowler and the best close fielder in England. He played for Western Australia until 1970-71 and was their captain from 1963\u201364, winning them the Sheffield Shield in 1967-68. Ted Dexter won the toss and elected to bat, but though he made 76 in 113 minutes with 2 sixes and 10 fours the other batsmen struggled as the MCC slumped to 161/7 with Des Hoare taking 4/92. They were rescued by the all-rounder Fred Titmus (88) and wicket-keeper Alan Smith (42), who added 119 in 130 minutes. This was the first eighth-wicket century partnership in WA-MCC matches and a record, but Lock (4/68) took the last four wickets and the innings closed on 303 at stumps.

South Australia had not won the Sheffield Shield for ten years, but were to do so again in 1963-64 with the help of their multi-talented import Gary Sobers. They were captained by the old favourite Les Favell and had a 19-year-old Ian Chappell in the team, but their slow left-arm wrist-spin bowler David Sincock was unable to play because of his exams. The Melbourne Cup was due to be played during the match, so Ted Dexter and the Duke were off to the races and Colin Cowdrey was in charge. Favell won the toss, batted, and saw his side make steady progress to 324/7 by the end of the day. Favell was first out for 7 and his fellow-opener John Causby was run out by Ken Barrington and wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 16, but John Lill (87) and Gary Sobers (42) stroked their way to a third-wicket stand of 113 before they were both out on 154, along with Neil Dansie for a duck and South Australia were 154/4. Ian McLachlan (53) and Ian Chappell (36) added 66 before the youngster tripped over himself while hooking Brian Statham and hit the wicket with his bat. Statham (4/58) cleared up the tail with 3 wickets for 11 runs and South Australia were out for 335. Fred Titmus (1/80) and Ray Illingworth (0/43) failed to turn the ball on the notoriously flat wicket and Cowdrey set up defensive fields which rather relied on the batsmen getting themselves out, still the runs flowed enough and the crowd enjoyed themselves. Cowdrey was out for this third consecutive duck when acting as opener, but everybody else had a fine time; Geoff Pullar (21) added 55 for the second-wicket with Ken Barrington (102), who added another 168 with the stylish Tom Graveney (99), beating the third-wicket record for the MCC vs South Australia set by Plum Warner and George Gunn in 1911-12. Graveney was the more polished of the two, but Barrington hit Neil Hawke (6/130) for 4 boundaries in five balls. They and Peter Parfitt (15) were all out by 257/5, but the depth of the MCC batting was shown by Fred Titmus who hit a solid 137 not out, his highest first class century, adding 108 runs with Barry Knight (55) and 121 with wicket-keeper Alan Smith (another 55) and Cowdrey declared on 508/9. South Australia knocked off the 173 run deficit the same day, making 174/5 by stumps, with Sobers (99) run out by Statham going for his 100th run and everybody else chipping in. A shower of rain allowed everybody to get off the field to watch the Melbourne Cup and Favell declared on 283/7 to leave the MCC 67 minutes to make 111 runs. They made 95/1, thanks to some quick hitting by Pullar (56), but after playing into more rain they gave up 16 runs short in an affable, but farcical end.

David Larter sent the ball flying over the batsmen's heads, but he scatter the ball all over the place. Len Coldwell dug the ball in as well and had a good slower ball, but failed to get the ball to swing. Peter Parfitt removed Des Ball with a diving catch at 10/1, but the rest of the day saw la number of missed chances and Queensland reached 123/2 by the end of the day.

Even \"Slasher\" Mackay looked good after this and the dour Queenslander started driving the ball through the covers, adding 85 with Des Hughson (26) and 88 with wicket-keeper Wally Grout who hit a swashbuckling 56 with 2 sixes and 6 fours. Mackay made 105 not out, the first century for Queensland vs the MCC since 1950-51 and their 433/7 declared was their highest score against them since the war. Geoff Pullar had the flu and Colin Cowdrey was also resting, so Peter Parfitt opened with David Sheppard saw the tourists through to stumps then took their stand to 101 the next day. Queensland's overseas player was the West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall and earlier on the Monday one of his bouncers rose awkwardly and broke Grout's jaw, he was hurried to hospital and missed the First Test as a result. Hall (0/106) was overbowled on the now flat Woolloongabba wicket and Queensland's best bowler was the leg-spinner Colin Westaway (3/156), which pretty much sums up the innings as the MCC piled up 581/6. Peter Parfitt made a subdued 47 and David Sheppard was dropped on 51, 77 and 83 before Mackay bowled him for 94. Ted Dexter powered his way to 80 in 85 minutes with a 6 and 13 fours, adding 110 with Sheppard. The insatiable Ken Barrington amassed 183 not out with 22 boundaries, including some superb drives, pulls and cuts, adding 103 with Tom Graveney (52) and 180 with the all rounder Barry Knight, who hit 2 sixes and 11 fours in his 81. Alan Smith came in at 512/6, but when he reached 22 he ducked into a Wes Hall bouncer that stayed low and became the second wicket-keeping casualty of the match. The Duke of Norfolk and the team physiotherapist Sam Cowan helped him off the field and took him to hospital, where to everyone's relief x-rays found that he had not fractured his skull. Dexter declared for 581/6 and John Murray came on as a substitute keeper. Queensland only had to bat out the afternoon, but Mackay re-arranged the batting order and they promptly collapsed to Dexter's medium-paced swing (4/8) and the part-time leg-spin of Tom Graveney (2/2). Mackay came in for the penultimate ball with the score on at 94/7 and was missed in the slips. With Grout unable to bat had Mackay been out the MCC would have needed to take Westaway's wicket with the last ball of the match for a surprise win in an otherwise dull game.pp. 35-39, Moyes and Goodmanp. 122, Swanton", "Returning to the first-class game the MCC played Victoria and their old nemesis Ian Meckiff, a \"chucker\" who had caused such ill-temper in 1958-59, but was not chosen for this series. His career was ended in 1963-64 when he was repeatedly no balled by Umpire Colin Egar against South Africa. Colin Cowdrey was still in charge and after winning the toss he put Victoria in to bat in the hope that there would be some early life in the Melbourne wicket. Victorian was a weak team in this period and their innings relied heavily on a long, tedious 177 by the 25-year-old captain Bill Lawry who added 85 with Jack potter (44) and 158 with Neville West (70). They staggered to 259/3 by the end of the day and collapsed to 340 all out the next morning, the last seven wickets falling for 72 runs. Brian Statham took 4/112, bowling steadily without any fire and Allen bowled 8 maidens to Lawry in his 3/57. Alan Connolly took 3/71 in reply, removing Peter Parfitt and David Sheppard to have the MCC 26/2. The Reverend walked after being given not out by the umpire, having given a feather-like edge to the keeper Ray Jordon. Cowdrey (46) and Tom Graveney (40) restored the situation with a stand of 81, but Cowdrey was run out and Keith Kirby (3/137) removed Graveney and Barry Knight. The depth of the MCC batting line-up was proven by Ray Illingworth (50), Geoff Pullar (91), batting with a runner after pulling a leg-muscle in the field and Alan Smith (41) before they were all dismissed by Meckiff (3/51). Statham hit a merry 26 and the MCC finished with 336, 4 runs behind Victoria. At the end of the third day Victoria were 135/5 and crashed to 175 all out the next day, Len Coldwell finding the cold weather and heavy atmosphere to his liking and taking 6/49 with his swing bowling. The MCC needed 180 to win and reached there target with five wickets in hand, Colin Guest took 3/32 and removing Pullar (2), Sheppard (50) and Cowdrey (63). It was a dull game and poorly attended, Johnny Moyes noting that Victorian are willing to pay to see good cricket, but the main draw Ted Dexter wasn't playing and this wasn't good cricket.pp. 64-69, Moyes and Goodman", "Sadly Johnny Moyes died suddenly on the first day of the two day match and his book on the series was completed by Tom Goodman of the Sydney Morning Herald. Due to the exciting Third Test a large crowd came to Newcastle, New South Wales to watch Northern New South Wales, with players from Newcastle, Canberra and Wollongong making up the side. The morning was lost to rain, the local captain won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and got them 180/6, despite Geoff Pullar making 53, but Barry Knight (73) and Alan Smith (45) adding 103 for the seventh-wicket and the MCC finished on 319. Douglas Dives (73) and Rodney Harvey (37) and Ken King (32) made most of the runs in the reply as Northern NSW were out for 203, Len Coldwell took 3/32 and David Allen 3/35. Batting again Dexter made 71 not out and Tom Graveney 41 before the MCC innings was declared at 190/4, leaving the home team 301 to win. After Max Fox (31) and Boxsell (40) added 68 for the first wicket they collapsed to 128/9 as Allen (5/38), Graveney (2/21) and Pullar (3/26) span them out. The crowd were determined to invade the ground on the point of victory, as they had seen in the Sydney Test, but last man Gilmour held everybody up by throwing his bat around for 29 in a last wicket stand of 33. When he was finally caught by Dexter off Geoff Pullar the enthusiastic crowd climbed the fences. Fred Trueman was bowled over and had his cap taken, but he soon recovered it and the teams ran off the field.pp. 114-116 Moyes and Goodman", "Having missed the first Victoria game Ted Dexter led the MCC in the return match. Bill Lawry won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and Ian Meckiff (5/93) had them in immediate trouble at 6/2 and 96/5. Tom Graveney was dropped in the slips, but returned to form with a magnificent 185 with 23 fours and supported by Fred Titmus (28), Alan Smith (46) and David Allen (25) he hoisted to score up to 375. Victoria's reply relied heavily on Jack Potter's 106 - nobody else made 35 - and Allen bowled himself back into form with 5/43 with help from David Larter (4/105) dismissed the Victorians for 307. The MCC made 218/5 to set up a run-chase, Ted Dexter making 70, Ken Barrington 66 and Graveney 38 not out, Meckiff taking 2/47. This left Victoria 252 minutes to make 287 runs, which they did not go for, instead they slumped to 116/7 and when Bob Cowper was out for 51 they were 148/8 with 50 minutes to go and certain to lose. Allen had taken 3/24 and Larter 3/45, but Meckiff's 38 held them up until he was dismissed by Barrington (2/60). Ken Kirby and Alan Connolly saw out the last few minutes and the game ended in a draw when they walked back on 188/9.pp. 133-135, Moyes and Goodman"]}]}}
