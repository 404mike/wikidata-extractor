This offered only temporary sanctuary, as the mountain passes leading to it could be occupied by the British, trapping the Boers. A force under General Archibald Hunter set out from Bloemfontein to achieve this in July 1900. The hard core of the Free State Boers under De Wet, accompanied by President Steyn, left the basin early. Those remaining fell into confusion and most failed to break out before Hunter trapped them. 4,500 Boers surrendered and much equipment was captured but as with Roberts's drive against Kruger at the same time, these losses were of relatively little consequence, as the hard core of the Boer armies and their most determined and active leaders remained at large."]}, {"page": "Governor of Gibraltar", "response": ["|80px|Sir Archibald Hunter||30 July 1910 to 11 July 1913||Sir Archibald Hunter, Governor||"]}, {"page": "Governor Hunter", "response": ["*Archibald Hunter (1856\u20131936), Governor of Omdurman in Sudan in 1899 and Governor of Gibraltar from 1910 to 1913"]}, {"page": "Lancaster (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Archibald Hunter || Coalition Conservative"]}, {"page": "Aide-de-camp general", "response": ["| General Sir Archibald Hunter || 15 January 1917 || 1 October 1920 ||"]}, {"page": "Charles Townshend (British Army officer)", "response": ["At this time, Townshend began to overplay his hand and alienate his superiors. When Winston Churchill, who had got to know him well in the Sudan, asked him to read over an early draft of his 1899 book The River War, Townshend in his notes attacked allies such as Sir Herbert Kitchener, Sir Archibald Hunter and Hector MacDonald, aka \"Fighting Mac\", as all having \"got a reputation \u2013 perhaps greater than they can uphold.\" After Omdurman, Townshend resigned from the Egyptian Army to take up a staff position in the Punjab, but then refused the job, as he wanted a command in South Africa, writing to both Redvers Buller and Sir Evelyn Wood, asking to be sent to South Africa, where relations with the Transvaal were declining and war was thought likely. After learning that neither Buller and Wood were able or willing to do so, Townshend arrived in India to take the staff command in the Punjab, only to learn the position had already been filled, as he had refused it. He then went to meet the Viceroy Lord Curzon, who then gave him the staff job after all. Shortly afterwards, the 5th Marquis died and Townshend asked for leave to go to England to settle the Townshend family affairs, which greatly annoyed Curzon as this prolonged absence left the staff job in the Punjab empty again."]}, {"page": "Archibald Murray", "response": ["Promoted to major on 1 June 1898, Murray served in the Second Boer War as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General for Intelligence in Natal from 9 October 1899 and then as chief of staff to the commander there.

Kitchener had asked for Girouard as he was reputably the best railroad builder in the entire British Empire. On 20 March 1896, the town of Akasheh was taken by Sir Archibald Hunter, and Girouard went to work building a railroad across the desert. By 4 August 1896 Girouard reported to Kitchener the railroad now extended from Wali Halfa to Kosheh, covering some 116 miles of arid desert.Pigott, Peter Canada In Sudan War Without Borders, Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2009 pages 79-80."]}, {"page": "King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)", "response": ["*1913 Gen.
