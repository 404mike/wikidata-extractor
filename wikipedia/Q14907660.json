He was sent to K\u00fcwu (presumably Quwo), to the south of Linfen in Southern Shanxi.  In 1886, he was ordained as a pastor by Hudson Taylor, and moved to Hungtung (now Hongdong or Hongtong) to work with Stanley P. Smith (Peregrine) who had opened an opium refuge there at the invitation of Pastor Hsi. He worked under Hsi, wore Chinese clothes, ate Chinese food, and tried to get an insight into the Chinese mind. Hoste is credited with making the Chinese churches apply the indigenous principles of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation."]}, {"page": "Stan Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Stanley P.

Smith, and his Norwegian wife Sophie de Reuter, who were missionaries in China.  His mother died when he was only one year old.  His father remarried after two years, and had three more children, his half brothers and sister.  At the age of six he went to a boarding school at Chefoo for three years, until the family went to England in 1899.  They left for furlough so were not in China at the time of the Boxer rebellion."]}]}}
