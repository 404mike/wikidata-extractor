He was born at Bedminster, Bristol and died at Southmead, also in Bristol.\nHall, a lower-order batsman and a bowler whose bowling style is unknown, has the distinction of taking the first wicket ever taken by Somerset in an authenticated first-class match when he had Lancashire opening batsman and captain Albert Hornby caught in the match at Old Trafford on 8 June 1882, and he followed it with a catch to dismiss the second Lancashire batsman, Walter Robinson. There were no other successes for Hall in this game: no more catches, wickets or runs when he batted and he then did not play against for Somerset in any first-class fixture for three years. By the time he reappeared for a single game in 1885 against Gloucestershire, whose team included W. G. Grace, he was being played as an opening batsman: to no great effect, as he scored 0 and 2 and Somerset lost very heavily. Though Hall went on to play minor matches for a further 10 years, this was his last first-class cricket game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Hall", "response": ["Henry Hall may refer to:", "* Henry Hall (MP), in 1601 MP for City of York", "* Henry Hall (bandleader) (1898\u20131989), British bandleader", "* Henry Hall (actor) (1876\u20131954), American actor, including in The Secret Witness", "* Henry Hall (poet) (died 1707), English poet and composer", "* Henry Hall (physicist) (1928\u20132015), British physicist", "* Henry Hall (Egyptologist) (1873\u20131930), British Egyptologist", "* Henry Hall (cricketer, born 1810) (1810\u20131864), Yorkshire cricketer", "* Henry Hall (Somerset cricketer) (1857\u20131934)", "* Henry Hall (British boxer) (1922\u20131979), British boxer", "* Henry Hall (American boxer) (1922-2016), American boxer", "* Henry Hall (footballer) (born 1945), Scottish former football player and manager", "* Henry Hall (Covenanter) (d. 1680)", "* Henry Hall (lighthouse keeper) (1661\u20131755), English lighthouse keeper", "* Henry Hall (lawyer) (fl. 1670\u20131692), English lawyer, High Sheriff and Fellow of the Royal Society.", "* Henry Hall (American revolution), fought in the American Revolutionary War and began the commercial cultivation of the cranberry", "* Henry Hall (farmer) (1802\u20131880), Australian farmer", "* Henry Hall (priest) (1734\u20131815), Archdeacon of Dorset", "* Henry Hall (bishop) (died 1663), English Anglican priest in Ireland"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Henry Hall (1882\u20131885) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Henry Hall "]}]}}
