There he obtained British citizenship and joined the Presbyterian church.\nAt the time, English law regarding the establishment of local chambers of commerce was highly unsystematic and wanting. He therefore advocated their institution in numerous pamphlets, leading to the establishment of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce in 1849, with Levi as its secretary. In 1850 he published his Commercial Law of the World, an exhaustive comparative treatise upon the laws and codes of mercantile countries. Appointed in 1852 to the chair of commercial law at King's College London, he was a popular instructor who innovated evening classes.\nLevi was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1859, and a doctorate in political science from the University of T\u00fcbingen. His chief work, History of British Commerce and of the Economic Progress of the British Nation, 1763-1870, is considered to be a partisan account of British economic development, but its value as a work of reference cannot be gainsaid. His other works include: Work and Pay; Wages and Earnings of the Working Classes; and International Law, with Materials for a Code. See also The Liquor Trades: A Report to M.T. Bass, M.P., on the Capital Invested and Number of Persons Employed Therein (1871).\nHe died at his home in Highbury on the 7th may 1888 and was buried in the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British Jews", "response": ["* Leone Levi, barrister and statisticianJewish Encyclopedia, VIII, 34"]}, {"page": "Leon Levi", "response": ["#redirect Leone Levi"]}, {"page": "Leo Chiozza Money", "response": ["In 1905 Money published the work for which he became most noted, Riches and Poverty. This analysis of the distribution of wealth in the United Kingdom, which he revised in 1912, proved influential and was widely quoted by socialists, Labour politicians and trade unionists. The future Labour Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, whose government from 1945-51 established the modern welfare state, recalled that, while he was working at a boys' club at Haileybury, he had spent an evening studying Riches and Poverty.John Bew (2016) Citizen Clem: A Biography of Attlee Among other things, Money claimed that 87% of private property was owned by 883,000 people (or 4.4\u00a0million if families and dependents were included), while the remaining 13% was shared between 38.6\u00a0million. These and other calculations were contested at the time as taking insufficient account of age and family structures, but were frequently cited as the best available figures of their kind.Harris, 1993 Money sought also to quantify Britain's middle class and its per capita wealth, calculating that 861,000 people in 1905 and 917,000 in 1912 owned property worth between \u00a3500 and \u00a350,000,The latter figure was broadly consistent with the number in the tax year of 1911\u201312 having annual professional, salaried or self-employed incomes above the lower income tax threshold of \u00a3160, although no direct correlation is possible: see Harris, 1993 although, allowing for four dependents per property owner, the per capita figure was less that \u00a31,000. In general his findings pointed to the modest size of most middle class fortunes in Edwardian times, a picture broadly consistent with calculations made by Robert Giffen and Michael Mulhall in the 1880s (although Money took the view that business wealth was becoming increasingly concentrated in a few hands, whereas, towards the end of the 19th century, Giffen and others, such as Leone Levi, had concluded that such wealth was being spread more widely).Harris, 1993"]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Leone Levi, statistician"]}, {"page": "List of Jewish economists", "response": ["* Leone Levi, political economist"]}, {"page": "List of Jewish mathematicians", "response": ["* Leone Levi (1821\u20131888), statistician"]}, {"page": "Levi (surname)", "response": ["* Leone Levi (1821\u20131888), English jurist and statistician"]}, {"page": "Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864\u201366", "response": ["| Leone Levi || Jurist and statistician"]}, {"page": "Swiney Prize", "response": ["*1854 Leone Levi, Commercial Law of the World."]}, {"page": "William Tallack", "response": ["Around 1868, Tallack also started to work for the Peace Society.
