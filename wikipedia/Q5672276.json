He made 395 appearances for Stoke in all competitions, and helped the club to win the Third Division North title in 1926\u201327 and the Second Division title in 1932\u201333. He went on to briefly manage League of Ireland side Dundalk in 1947. His son John also played for Stoke in the 1950s.

He failed to make a first team appearance between September and 9 March, only returning to the side following a run of three consecutive defeats. He broke his leg during 1935\u201336 pre-season training, but made a speedy recovery to feature in a 2\u20130 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield on 18 September. He found himself a first team regular under new manager Bob McGrory, who utilised him as a left-sided half-back in the place of ageing veteran Harry Sellars. Playing alongside Arthur Turner and Arthur Tutin, Soo would be a part of one of the club's great half-back lines. He played a total of 40 matches that season, helping Stoke to a fourth-place finish, the highest in the club's history.", "Soo was quick and intelligent, and was noted for his ability to deliver perfectly placed passes. Stan Mortensen wrote in his autobiography, Football Is My Game, that Soo was one of the four best wing-halves he ever played with (alongside George Farrow, Billy Wright and Harry Sellars), and \"seemed incapable of a clumsy movement\".

Aware of the financial problems that had dogged the club in the past, McGrory implemented a policy of blooding young talent.

It was brave management and it paid off as the young players developed into one of the most exciting teams in the country in the 1930s and in McGrory's first season in charge they finished a highest ever position of fourth with 47 points."]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Harry Sellars"]}, {"page": "Harold Sellars", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Sellars"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Harry Sellars"]}, {"page": "1925\u201326 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Harry Sellars"]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["There had been reservations regarding the midfield, but manager Tom Mather gambled and switched Harry Sellars to right-half, brought in Cecil Eastwood from Preston North End to occupy left-half and slotted Tom Williamson between them.
