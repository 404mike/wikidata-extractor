In 2003, Leaky posted a copy of 93 words allegedly emailed to the site, in reference to a 93-word card auctioned off the previous December with information about the plot of the upcoming fifth Potter book. In 2004, actor Jim Tavar\u00e9, who would appear later that year in the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban as Tom the Barman, attempted to oust the \"Muggles\" from the site. In 2005, the site closed down, posting a note about how tired the webmasters were of handling the foolish questions sent to them by readers each day. As a replacement, the site opened \"Ask Peeves\", a spoof on the Ask Jeeves search engine. In 2006, both the Leaky Cauldron and fellow Potter fansite MuggleNet shut down and redirected visitors to a new site, the Leaky Mug. The Leaky Mug's first announcement was the marriage of Leaky webmaster Melissa Anelli to MuggleNet webmaster Emerson Spartz. The two claimed to have merged their sites in the same way they had merged their lives. The next day, both sites were running normally; J. K. Rowling discussed the joke later on her official website. In 2007, Leaky posted a news item that said it'd be closing its doors following the upcoming publication of the final Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In 2008, the Leaky Cauldron announced that Sybill Trelawney, a Hogwarts professor of divination in the Potter series, would be joining the site's staff as a news editor. Leaky also announced that Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe would be eschewing his famous nude scenes in the upcoming Broadway debut of his play Equus and that the wizard rock band Harry and the Potters was disbanding. In 2009, the site automatically redirected to another website, Hooter, a play on Twitter. In 2010, the Leaky Cauldron became \"the Gleeky Cauldron\", a fansite for the popular Fox TV show Glee."]}, {"page": "Kate Shortt", "response": ["Kate Shortt is a British pianist, cello player, songwriter and comedian.
