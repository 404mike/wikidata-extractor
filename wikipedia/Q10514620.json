A winger, he is known for his rapid speed, nimble feet and trademark 'double somersault' goal celebrations. He has also represented the England C national football team as a midfielder. Having played for many different clubs Henry may be considered a journeyman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dean Holdsworth", "response": ["He made a return to Newport County in May 2008 as their new manager in succession to Peter Beadle, after handing in his resignation at Redbridge. He also relocated to Worcester to accommodate his new role at Newport. After a poor start to the 2008\u201309 season, Newport improved in the second half of the season to finish tenth in the league. Holdsworth was awarded the Conference South Manager of the Month award for April 2009. His signings included Craig Reid, Danny Rose, Paul Bignot, Jamie Collins, Charlie Henry, Sam Foley and Gary Warren.", "He assembled a number of free signings to replenish his squad: strikers Bradley Bubb and Michael Rankine; midfielders Anthony Pulis and Graeme Montgomery; defenders Aaron Brown and Jamie Collins; and goalkeeper Ross Worner. He also brought in a total of eight loanees in the first half of the season: Jake Taylor, Jordan Brown, Bruno Andrade, Adam Smith, Scott Davies, Jamie Day, Greg Pearson and Charlie Henry. His team proved to be inconsistent, though they did reach the Fourth Round of the League Cup, where they were beaten 3\u20130 by a Manchester United side that included Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Owen, and Antonio Valencia. In the January transfer window he released Graeme Montgomery and Anthony Pulis, whilst making four new loan signings in defenders Troy Brown and Sonny Bradley, midfielder Josh Payne, and striker Charlie Collins. He also recruited defender Chris Doig, and attempted to bolster his side's poor goalscoring record by paying a five figure fee for Cameroonian striker Guy Madjo. He also signed Stefan Payne, Wilko Risser and Josh Payne, as well as loanees Ben Smith, Darren Murphy, Michael Doughty, and Rob Sinclair. To make room for these signings he offloaded Jermaine McGlashan, Jamie Collins, Luke Guttridge, Chris Doig and Aaron Brown. The \"Shots\" finished the season just outside the play-offs."]}, {"page": "Charles Henry", "response": ["*Charlie Henry (baseball) (1900\u20131972), American Negro leagues baseball player", "*Charlie Henry (footballer, born 1962), English former footballer for Swindon Town, Torquay United, Northampton Town and Aldershot", "*Charlie Henry (basketball, born 1985), coach in the Chicago Bulls' organization", "*Charlie Henry (footballer, born 1986), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Football Conference", "response": ["|Charlie Henry"]}, {"page": "List of Newport County A.F.C. players", "response": ["*  Charlie Henry"]}, {"page": "Charlie Henry (footballer born 1986)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlie Henry (footballer, born 1986)"]}]}}
