Three members of the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club, Georges Romas, Guillaume S\u00e9ron, and A. R. Upton, are also left off of some lists despite evidence that they participated in the first round. The roster for the Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester as listed by the International Olympic Committee is Thomas Coe, John Henry Derbyshire, Peter Kemp, William Lister, Arthur G. Robertson, Eric Robinson, and George Wilkinson. Lister, however, had died two weeks prior to the Games, while Derbyshire, Robinson, and Wilkinson all played water polo matches in England either during the tournament or too soon after it to have traveled back from Paris in time. A list of players contemporary to the match does not include Robertson, but does list Coe and Kemp in addition to Robert Crawshaw, William Henry, John Arthur Jarvis, Victor Lindberg, and Frederick Stapleton. Lindberg has been considered the first New Zealand Olympian, although he \"was born in Fiji to Swedish and Irish parents, lived in New Zealand from a young age and, in Paris, represented a British club.\""]}, {"page": "William Henry", "response": ["Willie, Billy, Bill, Will or William Henry may refer to:", "*William Henry (gunsmith) (1729\u20131786), American gunsmith and Pennsylvania delegate to Continental Congress", "*William Henry (brother of Patrick Henry) (1734\u20131785), American member of Colonial Virginia House of Burgesses", "*William Henry (congressman) (1788\u20131861), American legislator from Vermont", "*William Henry, Libertarian nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Indiana in the 2020 Indiana gubernatorial election", "*William Henry, Prince of Orange (1650\u20131702), future King William III of England", "*William Henry, Prince of Nassau-Usingen (1684\u20131718), member of German royalty", "*William Henry, Prince of Nassau-Saarbr\u00fccken (1718\u20131768), member of German royalty", "*Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (1743\u20131805), younger brother of King George III of the United Kingdom", "*William Henry, Duke of Clarence (1765\u20131837), future King William IV of the United Kingdom", "*William Henry (swimmer) (1859\u20131928), English Olympic competitor", "*William Henry (priest) (before 1728\u20131768), Anglo-Irish Dean of Killaloe", "*William Henry (chemist) (1774\u20131836), English chemist who formulated Henry\u2019s law", "*William Henry (actor) (1914\u20131982), American performer; also billed as Bill Henry\u00a0", "*E.
