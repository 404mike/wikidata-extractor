In 1886, she became the first woman to sit at Oxford for a viva voce examination in modern history.Raised as a High Anglican, she also had interests in mysticism. She rose to fame following a claim that she and a fellow teacher, Charlotte Anne Moberly, had slipped back in time to the period of the French Revolution while on a trip to Versailles, known as the Moberly\u2013Jourdain incident. She and Moberly wrote a book together about the experience. The book was published pseudonymously; their identity was not revealed until the mid-1920s, after Jourdain's death. The book was a best seller but attracted much criticism. Jourdain was in Rome in 1912 with the family of Joan Evans, the art historian, and Evans remained loyal to Jourdain thereafter. She died of a sudden heart attack in 1924 after being forced to resign her post at St Hugh's College over an administrative decision, leaving Evans as her residuary legatee.", "link_mentions": {}}}
