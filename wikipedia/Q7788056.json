At the general election of 1865 he was elected for the district of Light, which he represented until 1868, when the fourth Parliament was dissolved. He remained out of the House for three years, but in 1871 he was elected for West Adelaide. Three years later he again retired from politics, reappearing in 1875 as member for Flinders, holding his seat for seven years, being re-elected in 1875 and 1878. In 1881 and 1882 he was once more out of the House, but was returned in 1883 and he sat until 1884. At the general election of that year he was returned with Thomas Burgoyne for the newly constituted district of Newcastle, but since 1887, when he had to give place to the Hon. T. Playford, who had been beaten at East Torrens, he did not occupy a seat in the House. At the general election of 1890 he stood for West Adelaide, but was defeated, and was also unsuccessful at the South Australian Legislative Council elections in 1891. At one time he took considerable interest in municipal matters and was elected mayor of Hindmarsh in December, 1888, remaining in office for one year."]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1912\u20131915", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne || Liberal || Flinders || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1910\u20131912", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne || LDU/LU  || Flinders || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1906\u20131910", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne || LDU || Flinders || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1905\u20131906", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne || FPPU || Flinders || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1902\u20131905", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne || ANL || Flinders || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1899\u20131902", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne ||  || Newcastle || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1896\u20131899", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne ||  || Newcastle || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1893\u20131896", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne ||  || Newcastle || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1890\u20131893", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne ||  || Newcastle || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1887\u20131890", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne || Newcastle || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1884\u20131887", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne || Newcastle || 1884\u20131915"]}, {"page": "Solomon Ministry", "response": ["|| Thomas Burgoyne MHA"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1915 South Australian state election", "response": ["|Newcastle (2) || | Thomas Butterfield*Andrew Kirkpatrick || Thomas BurgoyneEdward Twopeny || "]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1912 South Australian state election", "response": ["|Flinders (3) || Thomas ButterfieldJames O'Loghlin || | Thomas Burgoyne*James Moseley*John Travers*  || Thomas Ryan W.
