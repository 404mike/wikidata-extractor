He set up the first surf company in Britain.\nBailey grew up in Inglesbatch, in Somerset where his father withdrew him from school at age 14 due to his behaviour, and placed him in the Royal Air Force. There he trained as an engineer working on Short Sunderland flying boats and taking postings overseas. It was while working on air-sea rescue in Sri Lanka that he developed a love of the sea, quitting the air-force at the end of the 1950s and moving to Newquay to work as a lifeguard.Bailey began building life-saving equipment including a surf ski in 1961, designed to be used by lifeguards with paddles. While tinkering with the design he met two Australians on their way to the US, and was impressed with the foam core and fibre-glass construction of their surf boards. He bought one and learned to use it, becoming one of the first native surfers in Britain. In 1964 he began constructing surf boards himself and the following year formed a partnership with Bob Head to set up the European Surfing Company. Under its surfboard brand, BilBo, it produced around 12,000 boards over the next eight years. In the late 1960s A Bilbo shop was opened outside the train station of Newquay, which was quickly becoming the UK surfing capital.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bailey (surname)", "response": ["** Bill Bailey (outfielder) (1881\u20131967), Major League Baseball outfielder", "** Bill Bailey (pitcher) (1888\u20131926), Major League Baseball pitcher", "** Bill Bailey (Spanish Civil War veteran) (1911\u20131995), Irish-American labor activist", "** Bill Bailey (dancer) (1912\u20131978), American tap dancer and moonwalk pioneer", "** Bill Bailey (American football) (1916\u20131990), American football player", "** Bill Bailey (surfer) (1933\u20132009), known as \"the father of British surfing\"", "** Bill Bailey (Indiana politician) (born 1948), American businessman and politician", "** Bill Bailey (born 1965), British comedian, musician, actor, TV and radio presenter and author", "** Bill Bailey (American actor) (born 19??), American actor and author", "* The Bill Bailey trilogy by Catherine Cookson"]}, {"page": "William Bailey", "response": ["William or Bill Bailey may refer to:", "*Bill Bailey (Indiana politician) (born 1948), American businessman and politician", "*Bill Bailey (outfielder) (1881\u20131967), Major League Baseball outfielder", "*Bill Bailey (pitcher) (1888\u20131926), Major League Baseball pitcher", "*Bill Bailey (American football) (1916\u20131990), American football player", "*Bill Bailey (surfer) (1933\u20132009), known as \"the father of British surfing\"", "*Bill Bailey (dancer) (1912\u20131978), 1950s tap dancer and moonwalk pioneer", "*Bill Bailey (American actor) (born 1938), American actor and author", "*Bill Bailey (born 1965), English comedian, musician and actor", "*Bill Bailey (Spanish Civil War veteran) (1911\u20131995), Irish-American labor activist", "*The Bill Bailey trilogy by Catherine Cookson", "*Bill Bailey, a character played by George Innes in the 1969 film The Italian Job", "*Bill Bailey, a supporting character in the stage musical Cats", "*No Matter How Much You Promise to Cook or Pay the Rent You Blew It Cauze Bill Bailey Ain't Never Coming Home Again, 2003 novel by Edgardo Vega Yunqu\u00e9, called Bill Bailey for short", "*\"(Won't You Come Home) Bill Bailey\", song that inspired the novel"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2009", "response": ["*Bill Bailey, 75, British surfer."]}, {"page": "Inglesbatch", "response": ["Bill Bailey, a British surfer known as \"the father of British surfing\" grew up in the village."]}, {"page": "European Surfing Company", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Bailey (surfer)"]}]}}
