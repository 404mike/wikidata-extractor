He scored on his debut against York City in August 1968, doubling his tally of Football League goals in his 14-year career.  However, the vast majority of his 19-year service to the club would be in coaching capacities. Between March 1982 and November 1982 he was manager of the club (initially as caretaker), but he did not enjoy this role and happily returned to working with the youth team and helping his successors in the manager's chair. He did though have another tenure as caretaker manager the helm in January 1984, after previous caretaker manager Trevor Storton stepped down as the club awaited the appointment of John McGrath."]}]}}
