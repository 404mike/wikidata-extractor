G. Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy, 1918\u20131922 (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1972), pp. 92\u201393. and to take on the British forces with conventional military methods. This they strongly opposed, and de Valera relented, issuing a statement expressing support for the IRA, and claimed it was fully under the control of the D\u00e1il. He then, along with Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack, brought pressure to bear on Michael Collins to undertake a journey to the United States himself, on the pretext that only he could take up where de Valera had left off. Collins successfully resisted this move and stayed in Ireland. In the elections of May 1921, all candidates in Southern Ireland were returned unopposed, and Sinn F\u00e9in secured some seats in Northern Ireland. Following the Truce of July 1921 that ended the war, de Valera went to see Prime Minister David Lloyd George in London on 14 July. No agreement was reached, and by then the Parliament of Northern Ireland had already met. It became clear that neither a republic, nor independence for all 32 counties, was going to be offered; Lloyd George told de Valera he could \"put a soldier in Ireland for every man, woman and child in it\" if the IRA did not immediately agree to stop fighting.Coogan, Tim Pat De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow p. 234. In August 1921, de Valera secured D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann approval to change the 1919 D\u00e1il Constitution to upgrade his office from prime minister or chairman of the cabinet to a full President of the Republic. Declaring himself now the Irish equivalent of King George V, he argued that as Irish head of state, in the absence of the British head of state from the negotiations, he too should not attend the peace conference called the Treaty Negotiations (October\u2013December 1921) at which British and Irish government leaders agreed to the effective independence of twenty-six of Ireland's thirty-two counties as the Irish Free State, with Northern Ireland choosing to remain under British sovereignty. It is generally agreed by historians that whatever his motives, it was a mistake for de Valera not to have travelled to London."]}, {"page": "County Kerry", "response": ["*Austin Stack"]}, {"page": "Tralee", "response": ["Austin Stack Park is the main Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) stadium in Tralee.

He viewed this as an attempt to manipulate the IRA by a secret oath-bound organisation. The IRB became quiescent during the Civil War, which ended in May 1923, but it emerged again later that year as a faction within the National Army that supported Minister for Defence Richard Mulcahy against the \"Old IRA\", which fought against the recruitment of ex-British Army personnel and the demobilization of old IRA men. This came to a head with the Army Mutiny of 1924, in the wake of which Mulcahy resigned and other IRB members of the army were dismissed by acting President of the Executive Council Kevin O'Higgins. The IRB subsequently dissolved itself, although it is not known whether a formal decision was taken, or it simply ceased to function.\u00d3 Broin (1976), p. 221"]}, {"page": "Government of the 2nd D\u00e1il", "response": ["|Austin Stack"]}, {"page": "Government of the 1st D\u00e1il", "response": ["|Austin Stack"]}, {"page": "Minister for Justice (Ireland)", "response": ["|Austin Stack"]}, {"page": "Thomas Ashe", "response": ["He was convicted and sentenced to two years hard labour.
