Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck in the mud and then Les Cocker scored the equalising goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6\u20130, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Ian Brydon||||1955\u20131956||12||3||"]}]}}
