The moral panic of the press began in late 1988, when a UK 'red-top' tabloid called The Sun, which only days earlier on 12 October had promoted acid house as \"cool and groovy\" while running an offer on acid smiley face t-shirts, abruptly turned on the scene. On October 19, The Sun ran with the headline \"Evils of Ecstasy,\" linking the acid house scene with the newly popular and relatively unknown drug. The resultant panic incited by the tabloids eventually led to a crackdown on clubs and venues that played acid house and had a profound negative impact on the scene. Any records that mentioned the word acid, such as Dancin' Danny D's record with scene promoter Gary Haisman (D Mob's \"We Call It Acieed\"), were taken off radio and television playlists just as they were climbing towards the top of the UK chart. By the time Colston-Hayter had invited another ITV news team down to promote his latest party (this time from Granada's current affairs show World in Action) acid house was being described as a \"sinister and evil cult\" that was just encouraging people to take drugs."]}, {"page": "A Little Bit of This, a Little Bit of That", "response": ["# \"Trance Dance\" [featuring Gary Haisman] 4:13\t", "# \"We Call It Acieed\" [featuring Gary Haisman] 3:51\t"]}, {"page": "Now That's What I Call 80s Dance", "response": ["#D-Mob featuring Gary Haisman \u2013 We Call It Acieed"]}, {"page": "List of UK top-ten singles in 1988", "response": ["|Gary Haisman", "|align=\"left\"|D Mob featuring Gary Haisman"]}, {"page": "2018 in music", "response": ["** Gary Haisman (60), British hip house singer"]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Gary Haisman, 60, English musician."]}, {"page": "2018 in British music", "response": ["*28 November \u2013 Gary Haisman, 60, English musician."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2018", "response": ["*Gary Haisman, 60, English musician.Gary Haisman Dead"]}, {"page": "Haisman, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Haisman"]}]}}
