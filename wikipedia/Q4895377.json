Against Essex in 1952, he scored an unbeaten 121, but it was his only century and in the 1952 season as a whole his batting average was just 21.88. In the 1953 game with Worcestershire, he took five second innings wickets for 61 runs, his only return of five wickets in an innings; but in the very next match he was upstaged by the part-time off-breaks of Bert Wolton and was dropped from the team."]}, {"page": "Wolton (surname)", "response": ["* Bert Wolton (1929 \u2013 1990), English cricketer"]}]}}
