After Johnston's resignation in 1978 Buxton was appointed caretaker manager of Huddersfield Town. He quickly got the job permanently and set about revitalising the Fourth Division club. He installed John Haselden, who was already at the club, as his Assistant Manager and he would also take on the Physio duties. Buxton's first season was the 1978\u201379 season where Huddersfield finished 9th in the Fourth Division. It was the season after which would prove to be the catalyst for the most successful period of Town's history in the past 10 years. He offloaded the deadwood and brought in players such as Brian Stanton, Mick Laverick and Steve Kindon. He would eventually go on to be one of the most successful managers in the club's recent history, winning promotion to the Third Division at the end of the 1979\u201380 season where the team scored 101 goals in the league. This team is still loved by the club to this day and have held reunions in 2000, 2010, 2016 and 2017 where the majority of the team and coaching staff still attend. Buxton then took Huddersfield up to the Second Division in 1983. The Terriers would remain in the second tier for five seasons, but Buxton was sacked on 23 December 1986, to be replaced by Steve Smith. Mick Buxton later returned to Town in March 1993 as coach under Ian Ross, and helped the Terriers on one of their best runs in recent history where they only lost once in last eighteen games to avoid relegation. Buxton resigned at the end of the season and Ian Ross soon followed suit."]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|20||Brian Stanton||||45||6||3||0||54||1979\u20131986"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Brian Stanton||||MF||7 (6)||1||2||0||0 (1)||0||9 (7)||1"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Brian Stanton||||MF||3||1||0||0||0||0||3||1"]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Brian Stanton||||MF||33||6||1||0||6||1||40||7"]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["As that run was winding down, Town also managed a sensational 1-0 win at Leeds United in the League Cup third round, in which David Cowling scored the famous header that knocked Town's rivals.
