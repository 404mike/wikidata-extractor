Though runs came regularly from Arnold Hamer and less consistently from the West Indian Laurie Johnson and captain Donald Carr, the batting remained the weak point right up to the beginning of covered pitches in the 1980s. However, a series of seam bowlers served England as well as Derbyshire. The list began with Copson and continued with Cliff Gladwin, Les Jackson, Harold Rhodes, Alan Ward, Mike Hendrick and, most recently, Devon Malcolm and Dominic Cork. Spin was in short supply apart from the steady work of Edwin Smith and the under-rated all-rounder Geoff Miller, the current national selector of the England team and noted after-dinner speaker. The signing of Eddie Barlow, the famous South African, in 1976 and the lengthy period under the captaincy of Kim Barnett, starting in 1983, meant the side were rarely uncompetitive."]}, {"page": "Dominic Cork", "response": ["However, Derbyshire at this point in the club's history was beset with internal divisions, stemming from the resignation two years earlier of Dean Jones from the captaincy.  Such was the internal strife during that 1998 season that England's chairman of selectors David Graveney left Cork out of the 1999 World Cup squad, citing that the issues at Derbyshire were playing too heavily on Cork's mind to allow him to play international cricket. Before the start of the 1999 season, Cork demanded the Derbyshire committee return a number of powers to the captaincy, and when his demands went unfulfilled he threatened to resign from the county altogether.  Allied with Cork in the dispute were teammates Kim Barnett and Karl Krikken. Cork carried out his threat and asked to be released from the remainder of the four seasons left on his contract.  However Derbyshire refused to terminate the contract. Six months after the dispute began, the Derbyshire committee gave into Cork's demands allowing him more say over playing matters, coupled with the departure of Andy Hayhurst and Harold Rhodes from administration positions at the county, both of whom Cork cited as making his captaincy untenable.  The internal divisions between Cork and the county management soon became public knowledge, with former players like Ian Blackwell vocal of Cork's captaincy methods and his \"negative\" impact on the dressing room. During the dispute his form began to suffer, and another injury in 2001 did not help his case.  He was awarded a benefit year in 2001, with some of his benefit events being boycotted by the Derbyshire committee; this was a season in which Cork's appearances were limited to just a handful by his England duties and return to the England one-day side."]}, {"page": "Les Jackson (cricketer)", "response": ["After many delays, including the outbreak of World War II, Jackson became a professional with Worksop in 1947, playing in the Bassetlaw League and joined Derbyshire later in the 1947 season, making his first-class debut against Kent on 5 July 1947. He formed formidable bowling partnerships with Cliff Gladwin, and then with Harold Rhodes, both also England Test players. In the 1949 season, his second full season after joining Derbyshire, he took 120 wickets at a bowling average of 20.41. After a successful Test trial taking six fof 37, Jackson was selected in 1949 for the third Test against New Zealand at Old Trafford.Test no. 316: England v New Zealand at Old Trafford, 1949 He made his Test debut alongside Brian Close, opening the bowling with Trevor Bailey while the first choice fast bowler, Alec Bedser, was rested. Jackson met with some success, taking 2 for 47 and 1 for 25, but the match was drawn and he was replaced by Bedser for the fourth and deciding Test. He was not chosen to tour Australia in 1950\u201351, losing out to John Warr whose sole Test wicket came at a cost of 284 runs, but toured to India instead with a Commonwealth side, only to return home early with an elbow injury. Jackson played in another Test trial in 1950, but was unable to make much of an impression: on a soft wicket Jim Laker took 8 wickets for 2 runs, Bob Berry did the bulk of the bowling for \"The Rest\"England v The Rest in 1950 and Jackson's bowling was described as \"mediocre\"."]}, {"page": "List of international cricketers called for throwing", "response": ["*Harold Rhodes (ENG) \u2013 called in 1960 and 1965"]}, {"page": "Geoff Griffin", "response": ["Griffin's first match of the 1960 tour was against Derbyshire, on 7\u201310 May. During this game the umpire Paul Gibb called the Derbyshire fast bowler Harold Rhodes six times for throwing, but Griffin remained unmolested. He took three wickets in his side's easy victory. In his next county game, against Essex, on 14\u201317 May, Griffin again escaped attention from the umpires, but members of the media, including the writer and former Test bowler Ian Peebles, wrote that \"there was something amiss\". The following week, in the match against the MCC at Lord's on 21\u201324 May, Griffin was called for throwing by both umpires, John Langridge and Frank Lee, the first member of any touring side to be thus called.  When, a few days later, he was called again in the match against Nottinghamshire, it was clear that some action needed to be taken."]}, {"page": "Throwing (cricket)", "response": ["West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith, perhaps the most feared fast bowler of his generation, was often suspected of throwing his faster ball although he was not called in Test matches and the promising career of Derbyshire's Harold Rhodes was stunted by constant speculation about the legality of his action.  He was 'called' while playing against the South African tourists in 1960 by Paul Gibb but though he was eventually cleared and played on with great success for Derbyshire through the decade, he played just twice for England."]}, {"page": "Bradford Premier League", "response": ["* Harold Rhodes (England)"]}, {"page": "1965 English cricket season", "response": ["|| Harold Rhodes ||align=\"right\"| 3881 ||align=\"right\"| 187 ||align=\"right\"| 1314 ||align=\"right\"| 119 || 11.04"]}, {"page": "Brian Jackson (cricketer)", "response": ["In the 1964 season, with 79 Championship wickets Brian Jackson was by far the best bowler in the team and critics were impressed by his workrate although his average of 23.59 suggested Derbyshire was losing its traditional strength in pace bowling.Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, One Hundred and Second Edition (1965); p. 350 However, the 1965 season saw Brian Jackson advance remarkably to form with Harold Rhodes an immensely powerful opening attack: the two bowlers were first and second in the national averages. Jackson's superb outswinger and extremely accurate length made him an extremely formidable opponent on the damp pitches of that summer, and he was never mastered even on the better pitches."]}, {"page": "Indian cricket team in England in 1959", "response": ["England made six changes and one of the newcomers, Harold Rhodes, took wickets with his fourth and twelfth balls in Test cricket to reduce India to 23 for four, with new wicketkeeper Roy Swetman taking three catches. Later Indian batsmen did better, but no one reached 30 on a bland wicket. England's new opening pair of Gilbert Parkhouse and Geoff Pullar put on 146 for the first wicket, and then Cowdrey and Barrington put on 193 for the fourth wicket, Cowdrey going on to make 160. After early wickets for Moss and Trueman, India rallied with a partnership of 69 between Borde and Umrigar before the off-spin pairing of Brian Close and John Mortimore finished things off by five o'clock on the third day."]}, {"page": "John Aldridge (cricketer)", "response": ["At the start of the following season, 1960, Aldridge was again no-balled for throwing by umpire Jack Crapp in a game against Glamorgan at Pontypridd. Contemporary opinion appears to have been divided about the legality of Aldridge's bowling action: where other bowlers such as Tony Lock, Harold Rhodes, Pearson and the South African Geoff Griffin were suspect through physique or technique, Aldridge was a borderline offender. \"There is no true identity of opinion,\" said an article by the cricket correspondent of The Times early in the 1960 season before the issue came to a head with the no-balling of Griffin in the Lord's Test. \"Some, for instance, say that Aldridge, of Worcestershire, throws, others that he does not.\" In any case, as a bowler, Aldridge was much less effective in 1960 than he had been previously, his 40 wickets costing almost 30 runs apiece. Also, the emergence of left-arm orthodox spinners Doug Slade and Norman Gifford changed the balance of the Worcestershire bowling attack away from its dependence on seam bowling. Aldridge left the Worcestershire staff at the end of the 1960 season."]}, {"page": "Dusty Rhodes (cricketer)", "response": ["Rhodes died at Barlow, Derbyshire at the age of 67.
