With defender Huub Stevens joining the team, the league title was secured after a 4\u20131 result against Feyenoord. Earlier, a 1\u20130 victory over Roda JC meant that PSV won the national cup as well. In the European Cup, the final was only narrowly missed after a 1\u20130 aggregate loss against Saint-\u00c9tienne in the semi-finals. After the two consecutive titles, PSV ended second in 1977. The following year, Edstr\u00f6m left the squad but PSV nonetheless enjoyed a strong league campaign. In April 1978, the team secured the title without a single loss. The domestic cup ended early after a shocking 1\u20136 first round loss against FC Wageningen (PSV's biggest home loss ever to date). The UEFA Cup campaign proved to be more successful; after wins against Glenavon, Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Eintracht Braunschweig and 1. FC Magdeburg, the team faced Barcelona. A 3\u20130 win in the first leg was nullified by the Spaniards in the return leg, but a single goal by Nick Deacy at Camp Nou meant that PSV could progress with a 4\u20133 aggregate win. The two-legged final against Bastia first produced a goalless draw in the first match. The return leg in Eindhoven ended in a 3\u20130 win, with goals by Willy van de Kerkhof, Deijkers and Van der Kuijlen providing PSV its first European trophy."]}, {"page": "Barry Town United F.C.", "response": ["|FW|| Nick Deacy"]}, {"page": "Hereford United F.C.", "response": ["*  Nick Deacy"]}, {"page": "SBV Vitesse", "response": ["*  Nick Deacy (1979\u20131980)"]}, {"page": "Workington A.F.C.", "response": ["* Nick Deacy (F) (12 full caps, 4 goals)"]}, {"page": "K.
