As a conductor, he specialised in the music of late romantic composers; including Edward Elgar, Gustav Mahler, and Richard Strauss. He left a great legacy of recordings of British music, in particular Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Frederick Delius, and Benjamin Britten. He notably conducted the premiere recording of Britten's children's opera Noye's Fludde.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Strauss", "response": ["The metaphor \"Indian Summer\" has been used by journalists, biographers, and music critics, notably Norman Del Mar in 1964 to describe Strauss's late creative upsurge from 1942 to the end of his life. The events of World War II seemed to bring the composer\u2014who had grown old, tired, and a little jaded\u2014into focus.McGlaughlin, Bill. Exploring Music, Episode 5 of 5 of \"Richard Strauss\", first aired 9 January 2004. The major works of the last years of Strauss's life, written in his late 70s and 80s, include, among others, his Horn Concerto No. 2, Metamorphosen, his Oboe Concerto, his Duet Concertino for clarinet and bassoon, and his Four Last Songs."]}, {"page": "Timbre", "response": ["Instrumental timbre played an increasing role in the practice of orchestration during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Berlioz and Wagner made significant contributions to its development during the nineteenth century. For example, Wagner\u2019s \u201cSleep motif\u201d from Act 3 of his opera Die Walk\u00fcre, features a descending chromatic scale that passes through a gamut of orchestral timbres.  First the woodwind (flute, followed by oboe), then the massed sound of strings with the violins carrying the melody, and finally the brass (French horns).thumb|Wagner Sleep music from Act 3 of Die Walk\u00fcrethumb|center|600px|Wagner Sleep music from Act 3 of Die Walk\u00fcreDebussy, who composed during the last decades of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth centuries, has been credited with elevating further the role of timbre: \"To a marked degree the music of Debussy elevates timbre to an unprecedented structural status; already in Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune the color of flute and harp functions referentially\". Mahler\u2019s approach to orchestration illustrates the increasing role of differentiated timbres in music of the early twentieth century. Norman Del Mar  describes the following passage from the Scherzo movement of his Sixth Symphony, as \"a seven-bar link to the trio consisting of an extension in diminuendo of the repeated As\u2026 though now rising in a succession of piled octaves which moreover leap-frog with Cs added to the As. The lower octaves then drop away and only the Cs remain so as to dovetail with the first oboe phrase of the trio.\" During these bars, Mahler passes the repeated notes through a gamut of instrumental colors, mixed and single: starting with horns and pizzicato strings, progressing through trumpet, clarinet, flute, piccolo and finally, oboe:thumb|Mahler, Symphony No. 6, Scherzo, Figure 55, bars 5\u201312thumb|center|500px|Mahler, Symphony No. 6, Scherzo, Figure 55, bars 5\u201312 See also Klangfarbenmelodie."]}, {"page": "Cor anglais", "response": ["The pear-shaped bell (called Liebesfuss) of the cor anglais gives it a more covered timbre than the oboe, closer in tonal quality to the oboe d'amore. Whereas the oboe is the soprano instrument of the oboe family, the cor anglais is generally regarded as the alto member of the family, and the oboe d'amore\u2014pitched between the two in the key of A\u2014as the mezzo-soprano member.Norman Del Mar, Anatomy of the Orchestra (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981): 143.  (cloth); . The cor anglais is perceived to have a more mellow and plaintive tone than the oboe. The difference in sound results primarily from a wider reed and a conical bore that expands over a greater distance than the oboe's; although darker in tone and lower in pitch than the oboe, its sound is distinct from (though naturally blends with) the sound of the bassoon family. Its appearance differs from the oboe in that the instrument is notably longer, the reed is attached to a slightly bent metal tube called the bocal, or crook, and the bell has a bulbous shape (\"Liebesfuss\").", "Although the instrument usually descends only to (written) low B, continental instruments with an extension to low B (sounding E) have existed since early in the 19th century.Hector Berlioz, Berlioz's Orchestration Treatise: A Translation and Commentary, translated from the French by Hugh Macdonald (Cambridge Musical Texts and Monographs. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002): 108. . Examples of works requiring this note (while acknowledging its exceptional nature) include Arnold Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder, Gustav Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde, Heitor Villa-Lobos's Ch\u00f4ros No. 6, and Karlheinz Stockhausen's Zeitma\u00dfe. Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, in his Scherzo capriccioso, even writes for the cor anglais down to low A, though it seems unlikely that such an extension ever existed.Norman Del Mar, Anatomy of the Orchestra (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981): 158\u201359.

However, when appointed to a principal timpani chair in a professional ensemble, a timpanist is not normally required to play any other instruments. In his book Anatomy of the Orchestra, Norman Del Mar writes that the timpanist is \"king of his own province\", and that \"a good timpanist really does set the standard of the whole orchestra.\" A qualified member of the percussion section sometimes doubles as associate timpanist, performing in repertoire requiring multiple timpanists and filling in for the principal timpanist when required."]}, {"page": "City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["Despite the progress under Hugo Rignold, by the late 1960s the CBSO committee were beginning to look for a new conductor who could take the orchestra further, and in 1967 Rignold resigned after being offered a one-year contract extension instead of having his existing three-year deal renewed. This left the orchestra without a principal conductor for the 1968\u20131969 season, but also left it free to give trials to potential replacements. Norman Del Mar and Walter Susskind both gave successful concerts, but the strong favourite throughout the process was the conductor of the first concert, the Frenchman Louis Fr\u00e9maux, whose appointment was announced from autumn 1969. Fr\u00e9maux had made his reputation with the Monte Carlo Orchestra, particularly for his recordings of French music, releasing over 30 recordings and winning 8 Grand Prix du Disque. For the first three years of his appointment in Birmingham he combined his role with continuing as the founding conductor of the Orchestre Philharmonique Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes in Lyon, but in 1972 he resigned from Lyon to concentrate on his Birmingham activities, performing 70 concerts a season with the CBSO even though only contracted to provide 30."]}, {"page": "Havergal Brian", "response": ["| rowspan=2 | No. 9 || rowspan=2 | A minor|| Norman Del Mar || LSO || 1959 || Yes"]}, {"page": "Frederick Delius", "response": ["Full recordings of the operas were not available until after the Second World War.

Ratz, however, did not offer documented support, such as Alma Mahler's 1919 telegram, for his assertion that Mahler \"changed his mind a second time\" at some point before his death. In his analysis of the Sixth Symphony, Norman Del Mar argued for the Andante/Scherzo order of the inner movements,Del Mar, Norman, Mahler's Sixth Symphony \u2013 A Study. Eulenberg Books (London), ,  (1980). and criticised the Ratz edition for its lack of documentary evidence to justify the Scherzo/Andante order. In contrast, scholars such as Theodor W. Adorno, Henry-Louis de La Grange, Hans-Peter J\u00fclg and Karl Heinz F\u00fcssl have argued for the original order as more appropriate, expostulating on the overall tonal scheme and the various relationships between the keys in the final three movements.

Among his principal players were Kell and Brain. The following year Kell announced his forthcoming resignation, and Brain suggested to Beecham that Brymer would be a suitable replacement. Brymer had returned to his teaching post after being demobilised from the RAF, and was incredulous at receiving a telephone call from Beecham inviting him to audition. Brymer's first reaction was to think it was a practical joke, with one of his musical friends impersonating Beecham's familiar lordly drawl. Having realised that it was indeed Beecham calling, Brymer accepted the invitation to audition. Having heard him play, Beecham appointed him to succeed Kell. His first appearance with the orchestra was in EMI's Abbey Road Studios, recording Richard Strauss's Ein Heldenleben. Brymer recalled \"an old man in a raincoat leaning over my shoulder to mark the part of his Heldenleben \u2013 Richard Strauss in the last year of his life\". Many years later Brymer crossed swords with the conductor, Norman Del Mar over interpreting Strauss. A historian of the London Symphony Orchestra wrote, \"Rehearsing Don Quixote, Del Mar had the temerity to admonish Brymer for playing a phrase too loudly: 'Just a memory, Jack, just a memory,' Del Mar called out. 'Why are you playing it mezzo-forte?' 'Because Strauss told me to,' Brymer retorted.
