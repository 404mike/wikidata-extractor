He spent most of his career at Oxford University as a fellow of Nuffield College and finished his career as Foundation Professor of Economics at the University of Lancaster.  He made his name with his detailed case study investigations of business behaviour and analysis of manufacturing firms, which he characterized as intensely competitive and oligopolistic. Andrews advocated for the use of empirical business case studies to advance industrial economics. From 1944 until his death in 1971 he worked and published with Elizabeth Brunner.", "link_mentions": {}}}
