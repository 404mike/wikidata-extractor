The group makes a number of fashion statements, incorporating silver and street style ensembles designed by Sophie Hulme, Gemma Slack, Cassette Playa and Gareth Pugh. The visual features CL sporting a wrestler (complete with a sparkling WWE championship belt), futuristic and punk-inspired attire, metal-studded leather pieces, and unconventional hairstyles; for example, CL's resembles a bull\u2019s horn while Dara's resembles that of the Dragon Ball character Vegeta. They are seen ascending stairs during the third chorus while breaking platinum records with baseball bats, seemingly indicating the widening of boundaries of the genre. The final scene features the members with AK-47s, destroying the former pyramid with a new mirrored triangle subsequently emerging with \"2NE1\" reflecting in the light."]}]}}
