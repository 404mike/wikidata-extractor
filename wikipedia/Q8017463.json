Two reports had previously been issued on the subject by Sir William Reid, Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman between 1990 and 1996.  It was found by Reid that the National Health Service had failed to make long-term care available to patients with mental and physical health needs.  There were also failings in how health authorities had set the eligibility criteria for funding.  The report published by Abraham in February 2003 was strongly critical of the Department of Health.  It was found that numerous health authorities were using criteria that was too restrictive in determining eligibility for funding for NHS care that was not in line with that laid down by the Department after the judgment in ex parte Coughlan.R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan [2001] QB 213, Abraham found that the cost of caring for patients with very severe disabilities was left to relatives instead of the National Health Service.Health Service Commissioner, Second Report 2002\u201303, E.420/00-01; E.1626/01-02. She recommended the Department take a strong lead in providing a \"very clear, well defined national framework\" for determining eligibility.  This the Government undertook to do, as well as a retrospective review of cases that it had determined.  The backlog of retrospective review cases grew to such an extent that Abraham took the decision in June 2004 to accept cases directly without complainants having to exhaust the NHS complaints procedure.  In a follow-up report in December 2004, Abraham criticised the shortcomings which she had discovered in the retrospective review process.  Record keeping was often poor, decisions were sometimes taken without clinical advice and review processes were sometimes secretive.  Once again, Abraham insisted on a national framework for criteria and recommended the development of good practice guidance to support the criteria.Health Service Commissioner, First Report 2004\u201305. Thereafter, the Office engaged deeply with the Department and the health authorities to ensure that cases were properly assessed according to criteria.  The Department published its national framework for determining funding eligibility in June 2007 and the number of NHS continuing care cases being handled by the Office shrunk from 1,500 in November 2007 to just 100 in March 2008.Health Service Commissioner, Annual Report 2007-08, pp. 45\u201348. Through its rigorous reporting and active engagement with the Department, the Office under Ann Abraham had helped bring about service improvement in the NHS and provide justice to those wrongly denied funding."]}, {"page": "Michael Buckley (civil servant)", "response": ["Buckley was appointed as Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman to succeed Sir William Reid and took up the post in January 1997."]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967", "response": ["In his 1993 Annual Report as Ombudsman, Sir William Reid sought to expand upon the Crossman catalogue to emphasise that 'maladministration' should not be interpreted restrictively.
