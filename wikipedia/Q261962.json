Hughes, Stephen King, Tanith Lee, A. A. Milne, and P. G. Wodehouse have all written Sherlock Holmes pastiches. Contemporary with Conan Doyle, Maurice Leblanc directly featured Holmes in his popular series about the gentleman thief, Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, though legal objections from Conan Doyle forced Leblanc to modify the name to \"Herlock Sholmes\" in reprints and later stories. Famed American mystery writer John Dickson Carr collaborated with Arthur Conan Doyle's son, Adrian Conan Doyle, on The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes, a pastiche collection from 1954. In 2011, Anthony Horowitz published a Sherlock Holmes novel, The House of Silk, presented as a continuation of Conan Doyle's work and with the approval of the Conan Doyle estate; a follow-up, Moriarty, appeared in 2014. The \"MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories\" series of pastiches, edited by David Marcum and published by MX Publishing, has reached thirty volumes and features hundreds of stories echoing the original canon which were compiled for the restoration of Undershaw and the support of Stepping Stones School, now housed in it."]}, {"page": "September 19", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Tanith Lee, English author (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "1947", "response": ["* September 19 \u2013 Tanith Lee, British author (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "2015", "response": ["* May 24 \u2013 Tanith Lee, British writer (b. 1947)"]}, {"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*Tanith Lee (1947\u20132015)"]}, {"page": "Arkham House", "response": ["* Dreams of Dark and Light: The Great Short Fiction of Tanith Lee, by Tanith Lee (1986)"]}, {"page": "List of fantasy authors", "response": ["* Tanith Lee, (1947\u20132015) author of the Tales from the Flat Earth series"]}]}}
