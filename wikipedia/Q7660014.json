He faced opposition from Frank Morley Fletcher and Sydney Lee who taught classes in colour woodcuts in the Japanese style. Lethaby had had to overcome opposition to Johnston's calligraphy classes, and, along with most artists at the time, saw wood engraving simply as the reproductive medium that it had been until then. He vetoed the introduction of the new style of wood engraving into the curriculum. When he left in 1911 Rooke was able introduce a class in lettering and wood engraving in 1912, and a class in wood engraving and poster design in 1913."]}, {"page": "Allen W.

Cathy Sloan concludes in an article for Nature in Art that Seaby's work bridges \u2018the gap between fine art and so called \"wildlife art\"\u2019 (1995: 10).
