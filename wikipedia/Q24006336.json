He argued that they reduce economic inefficiencies, by lowering the cost of acquiring information about the sellers' products. The operators of online marketplaces are able to adapt their business model because of the data they hold on the platform users. Online marketplace operators have a unique ability to obtain and use in their economic decision making personal data and transaction data, but also social data and location data. Therefore academics have described online marketplaces as new economic actor, or even as a new type of market economy. In 2010 Christian Fuchs argued that online marketplaces operated informational capitalism. The inherent feedback loop allows the operators of online marketplaces to grow their effectiveness as economic intermediaries. In 2016 Nick Srnicek argued that online marketplaces give rise to platform capitalism. In 2016 and 2018 respectively, Frank Pasquale and Shoshana Zuboff cautioned, that the data collection of online marketplace operators result in surveillance capitalism."]}, {"page": "Speculative realism", "response": ["* Nick Srnicek"]}, {"page": "Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London", "response": ["The department runs a Bachelor's degree in Digital Culture which looks at how technological innovations are bringing about new challenges and opportunities in our societies.

Tiziana Terranova's \"Red Stack Attack!\" links Bratton's stack model and left-wing accelerationism. Out of Xenofeminism grew a strand of accelerationist thought labeled \"gender accelerationism,\" asserting that the destruction of the patriarchy and the gender binary is not just a preferred future, but an outright inevitability of capitalism's acceleration.
