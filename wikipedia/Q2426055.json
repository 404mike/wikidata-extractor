There he studied under Thomas George Bonney and Thomas McKenny Hughes, graduating with First Class Honours in 1878. As an undergraduate, he published several papers, including one on his discovery of Cambrian fossils in Caernarfonshire that could not be accurately dated, something that occupied a lot of his later work.
