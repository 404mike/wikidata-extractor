He played a further two matches that season, and another two the following year, but it was not until 1902 that he established himself in the Worcestershire side, replacing Thomas Straw as regular wicket-keeper.\nIn that 1902 season, Gaukrodger played 24 times, including the aforementioned game for the Players at Harrogate; he failed twice with the bat, but pulled off two stumpings. In total he made 48 dismissals, a tally which was to remain his best, and nor did he ever surpass the 666 first-class runs he hit that year, which included 58 against the Australians at New Road.\nHe enjoyed another good season with the bat in 1903, once more passing 500 runs and hitting his highest first-class score when he made 91 against Lancashire in June, putting on 167 with HK Foster to drag Worcestershire from the depths of 32/4. With the exception of last man Robert Burrows (18), Gaukrodger and Foster were the only batsmen to reach double figures in the first innings. His 37 dismissals in 1903 also contributed to a satisfactory summer.\nNever again did Gaukrodger play more than 13 times in a season, being gradually superseded by Bale. However the best summer of his later years was 1907, when he took 26 catches and made 13 stumpings. His batting, however, fell away. In 1906 he managed only 82 runs from 21 innings with an average below 6. One score of exactly 50 in 1904 proved to be his last half-century, although he did score an unbeaten 45 against Kent in 1908.\nGaukrodger's last first-class appearance of all was also his only match of the 1910 season, against Lancashire at Worcester, making 0 not out and capturing three dismissals. He did not appear at this level again, giving up his position completely to Ernest Bale.\nHe umpired one first-class match, standing with George Bromhead at Worcestershire's game against the Philadelphians in July 1908 though he officiated in Club and Ground fixtures..\nA gifted sportsman, Gaukrodger played football at the international level, appearing for Ireland against Wales in March 1895. He was not yet eighteen but earned his selection as a prolific goal scorer after success in the Irish league for the Belfast side Linfield.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Straw", "response": ["In his 13 matches during the 1899 season, Straw held 29 catches and made one stumping, the latter against Oxford University. For the next two seasons he remained an integral part of the Worcestershire side, claiming a total of 90 dismissals in those two summers; however, he was replaced by George Gaukrodger for the 1902 season. Straw returned to the side for a single game against Oxford University in 1903, but was otherwise absent from the team for several years."]}, {"page": "Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)", "response": ["Lacking the strength in depth enjoyed by England and Scotland, Irish internationals of this era started younger and their careers lasted longer than their English or Scottish contemporaries. As a result, Ireland fielded both the youngest and oldest national teams during the 19th century. Samuel Johnston had led the way in the early 1880s. Then on 27 February 1886 Shaw Gillespie, at the age of 18, became the youngest goalkeeper of the 19th century. Both Olphert Stanfield and W.K. Gibson were only 17 when they made their debuts. Another 17-year-old debutant was future Worcestershire cricketer, George Gaukrodger. In Johnston, Gibson and Gaukrodger, Ireland also had three of the four youngest goalscorers in the 19th century. Stanfield would go on to win 30 caps for Ireland, making him the most capped international of the century."]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1902", "response": ["Albert Bird got six wickets for Worcestershire after they were put in the field at New Road. The Australians made 274, then bowled out Worcestershire for 202 despite a last-wicket stand of 62 between George Gaukrodger and Robert Burrows. At the end of the second day, the Australians had added a further 169 for the loss of five wickets, and though they lost their final wickets for 30 runs, Worcestershire were bowled out for 97 by Ernie Jones (six for 53) and Warwick Armstrong (four for 34)"]}, {"page": "Douglas James Smith", "response": ["His next first-class game was not until 1901, when he turned out for Worcestershire against Hampshire at Worcester, making 3 and 10. He played a handful more games for the county over the next few years, but did nothing of note other than to make his only first-class stumping. This came in his very last first-class game, against Lancashire in 1904, when in the absence of Worcestershire's usual keeper (George Gaukrodger) he played behind the stumps and accounted for Lancashire's own keeper, William Findlay."]}, {"page": "Ernest Bale", "response": ["Although he only played eight more games that summer, the following year he was selected on 13 occasions, and by 1910 he had taken over from George Gaukrodger as Worcestershire's number one keeper. He was selected for The Rest to face champions Kent at the end of the season,"]}, {"page": "Gaukrodger, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Gaukrodger"]}]}}
