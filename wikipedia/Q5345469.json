The chapel was restored and rededicated by the Bishop of Ely in July 1975. Betjeman wrote a short poem entitled \"Guyhirn Chapel of Ease\" for a pamphlet in 1977, later anthologised in Harvest Bells: New and Uncollected Poems in 2019. After Betjeman's death, the writer Edward Storey became the president of the Friends. Supported by the Friends, the chapel is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade\u00a0II* listed building."]}]}}
