Pedestrianism, in which people were allowed to wager on long distance competitive walking and running events, brought a standardising of athletics which reflected the modernisation of Welsh industrial society. In the second half of the 19th century the Victorian middle-classes began to organise and codify a range of sports. At the forefront of the codification of sports was Welshman John Graham Chambers, who although more famed for devising the Queensberry Rules for boxing, also formed the Amateur Athletic Club in 1866, and was present at the formation of the Amateur Athletic Association in 1880. Chambers championed athletics in Wales and organised the country's first Athletics meeting, held at Hafod Estate in Cwmystwyth near Aberystwyth in 1860. In 1875, the Newport Athletic Club was formed, the first in Wales.The date of formation of Newport Athletics club, originally called the Newport Cricket, Athletic and Football Club, is contested by several sources. Archives Network Wales states 1875, while The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales (2008) returns a date of 1877 (p.41). David Smith in his study of the Welsh Rugby Union, Field of Dreams(1980) states that Richard Mullock was secretary of Newport Athletic Club since 1874 (p.36). This was followed in 1882 with the creation of Cardiff Roath Harriers, the first pure athletics club in the country with no connections to other winter sports. By the late 19th century professional races were an established means for men to earn money. The Wales rugby captain Arthur Gould, who was also a notable sprinter and hurdler, had by 1890 amassed over \u00a31,000 in foot races alone."]}, {"page": "Mullock, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Mullock"]}]}}
