Lear Corporation, who used to support Jaguar in their Formula One campaign, were announced as the secondary sponsor.

Ho-Pin Tung was also retained in his position. In addition to his reserve driver duty, Tung also served as a pundit and was part of the Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy broadcast team. For the 2019 rookie test (which was once again held in Marrakesh following the ePrix), the team opted to bring back Pietro Fittipaldi and pair him with Harry Tincknell. In March 2019, just after the inaugural Sanya ePrix, Piquet left the team following a string of poor results (in contrast to Evans' string of points finishes) and was replaced by former Virgin driver Alex Lynn. Evans managed to win the following race in Rome, giving Jaguar their first win \u2013 this was also the team's first actual podium finish in the series. His teammate Lynn finished 12th on his Jaguar debut.

No issues were found, thus the win became officially confirmed.", "In June 2019, Jaguar began their season six development testings with Alex Lynn and Mitch Evans. The team also tested James Calado, a potential candidate for the second seat. On 26 September, Jaguar formally confirmed Evans as their first driver as he signed a multi-year contract with the team.

In the first race, Evans finished third after successfully defending his position over Ren\u00e9 Rast.

In the following race, Bird won his first race in the Jaguar overalls after starting from third and successfully overtaking Dragon's S\u00e9rgio Sette C\u00e2mara at the start and later the pole-sitter Robin Frijns, his former Virgin Racing teammate. The race however ended prematurely as it was red-flagged due to Alex Lynn being involved in a huge collision with Evans, who retired in the process as he tried to check on Lynn, who was later taken to hospital. After this race, Jaguar have moved to the lead in Teams' Championship for the very first time. At the Valencia ePrix double-header, the team lost its lead in Teams' Championship as it failed to score a single point after poor qualifying performances in both races due to wet conditions in their qualifying group.", "|style=\"text-align:left\" | Alex Lynn"]}, {"page": "Red Bull Ring", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| GP2 || 1:15.757 || Alex Lynn || Dallara GP2/11 || 2015 Spielberg GP2 round"]}]}}
