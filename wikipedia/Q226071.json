In early November, the Gunbarrel Road Construction Party (GRCP) assembled near Coober Pedy in South Australia, half coming from Adelaide together with a bulldozer, and half with a grader from Maralinga, led by Len Beadell.  The starting point was Victory Downs homestead just over the border with the Northern Territory, and  west of the Stuart Highway. Work began on 13 November 1955, and continued westward to Mulga Park. An interruption occurred after about  when the grader's blade mounting bolts were snapped after hitting a submerged Mulga tree root.  Beadell made a hurried return trip to Alice Springs for parts.  The road reached Mulga Park on 2 December, where construction ceased for the year, as the bulldozer's starting pilot motor had failed.  Beadell continued ahead on a ground reconnaissance, then on 7 December made an aerial survey which departed from a natural airstrip in the Mount Davies vicinity, and flew towards the Rawlinson Ranges where the future weather station was to be located.  With the knowledge gained, Beadell led a ground party of four Land Rovers to the site where a stone cairn was built on 12 December.  The site was named Giles after Ernest Giles (the first European to explore the area in 1874).

He incorrectly deduced from his conversations with Southern Arrernte that the name was derived from the gigantic mythological snake (known as the Rainbow Serpent) which was believed to have created the river, and thought that larapinta meant snake in the local language. However in July 1876, Rev. Georg A. Heidenreich, the Superintendent of the Finke River Mission Station, appears to have been the first to have confirmed the Western Arrernte name of the river, which was actually \"Lara Beinta\", which means \"Salt River\".
