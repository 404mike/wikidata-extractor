He reappeared for Somerset in one match after the start of the First World War in August 1914, although he played under an assumed name, A. Key.An allrounder, Lewis was a middle to lower order batsman and right-arm fast-medium pace bowler.\nHe scored 9 first-class hundreds, his highest was an unbeaten 201 against Kent in 1909 after he'd made a duck in his first innings. Somerset followed on and Lewis's innings earned them a draw. With the ball he took over 500 wickets for Somerset and took his best innings bowling figures of 8 for 103 against Warwickshire in 1908, finishing the match with 14 wickets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Talbot (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Talbot Lewis (1877\u20131956), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Mervyn Herbert", "response": ["Though Herbert played occasional matches for Oxford University he was not selected as a blue, and from 1903 most of his first-class cricket was for Somerset. Only in 1909 was he able to play at all regularly and in that season he made his highest first-class score, 78, in the match against Middlesex at Lord's. He also played an innings of 55 in 1909, batting at No 9 and sharing an eighth wicket partnership of 125 with Talbot Lewis that enabled Somerset to save the match against Kent, the 1909 County Champions, after following on. He did not play at all after 1912 until he reappeared in one match in each of the 1922, 1923 and 1924 seasons."]}, {"page": "West of England cricket team", "response": ["* Talbot Lewis (1910)"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Talbot Lewis", "|align=left|Talbot Lewis", "|align=left|Talbot Lewis", "|align=left|Talbot Lewis", "|align=left|Talbot Lewis"]}, {"page": "Osbert Mordaunt (cricketer, born 1876)", "response": ["Mordaunt was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler. He made his debut for Somerset in a single match in 1905 against Middlesex at Lord's. He made little impression in that match or in two further games in 1906, but in the very weak Somerset side of 1907 he appeared 10 times and his slow bowling took 30 wickets. His best return and the only time he took five wickets in an innings came in the game against Gloucestershire, when he took five for 68 in the first innings and four for 24 in the second, sharing the wickets in the match with Talbot Lewis (there was one run out batsman). After 1907, Mordaunt played only one further match for Somerset in 1910."]}, {"page": "Guy Goodliffe", "response": ["Goodliffe made his debut for Berkshire in the 1901 Minor Counties Championship against Buckinghamshire.  Later, while studying at the University of Oxford, Goodliffe made a single first-class appearance for Oxford University Cricket Club against Somerset at University Parks in 1904. During this match, he was dismissed for a duck by Talbot Lewis in Oxford University's first-innings.  He took two wickets during the match, those of George Barne in Somerset's first-innings, and Gerard Hodgkinson in their second-innings, with Oxford University winning by an innings and 45 runs. This was his only first-class appearance for the university.  He continued to play for Berkshire during this period, with him playing for the county until 1907.  He made a total of ten Minor Counties Championship appearances."]}]}}
