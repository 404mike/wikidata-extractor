This sort of activity led Mott to writing two books. The first one, which was edited together with Ian Sneddon, gives a simple and clear description of quantum mechanics, with an emphasis on the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in real space. The second describes atomic and electronic collisions in gases, using the rotational symmetry of electronic states in the Hartree\u2013Fock method."]}, {"page": "Jacques-Louis Lions", "response": ["*with Roger Dautray: Mathematical analysis and numerical methods for science and technology. 9 vols., 1984/5; translated from Analyse math\u00e9matique et calcul num\u00e9rique pour le sciences et le techniques by Ian Sneddon"]}, {"page": "Arthur W.

He built up such a network of contacts being invited several times to lecture on his research by various universities and research institutions, and also participating to several academic conferences, always upon invitation. This long series of scientific journeys started in 1951, when he went to the USA together with his master and friend Mauro Picone and Bruno de Finetti in order to examine the capabilities and characteristics of the first electronic computers and purchase one for the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo: the machine they advised to purchase was the first computer ever working in Italy. The most complete source about his friends and collaborators is the book  by his wife Matelda: in those reference it is also possible to find a fairly complete description of Gaetano Fichera's scientific journeys."]}, {"page": "Frank Matthews Leslie", "response": ["He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1995.
