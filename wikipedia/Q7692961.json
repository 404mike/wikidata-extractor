However, believing the club lacked the ambition to do so, manager Frank Womack left Torquay at the end of the 1931\u201332 season.Holgate, Mike (1999). Torquay United Football Club 1899-1999. Tempus Publishing.   His replacement was Frank Brown who had played for the Magpies in their non-League days and had subsequently become a trainer under Percy Mackrill and then Womack.  His first task was to rebuild the team, replacing stalwarts such as Bob Smith, Jack Butler and Laurie Millsom with newer, younger faces.  Of the team which lined up on the opening match of the season against Coventry City, eight out of the starting eleven were debutants, with new goalkeeper Percy Maggs and centre back Jack Tennant becoming ever-presents throughout the campaign, as was right half Ted Anderson who had joined the Magpies for the second half of the previous season.Edwards, Leigh (1997). The Definitive Torquay United F.C.. The Association of Football Statisticians. .", "Inevitably, with a much improved side, the Torquay players began attracting attention from other clubs.  At the end of the season both Jack Tennant and Alf Gray were sold to First Division side Liverpool, while Ted Anderson was also lured away to Second Division West Ham United.  Perhaps most heartbreaking of all to the Plainmoor faithful was the departure of Dartmouth born right winger Ralph Birkett.  After 98 appearances and 20 goals for Torquay, the 20-year-old Birkett was sold to eventual First Division champions Arsenal, with manager Herbert Chapman willing to pay the significant amount of \u00a31,588 to secure his services.Edwards, Leigh; Gibbes, Jon; Lovis, John (1999).
