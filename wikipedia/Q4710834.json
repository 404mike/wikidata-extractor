Albert Meltzer argued that anarcho-capitalism simply cannot be anarchism because capitalism and the state are inextricably interlinked and because capitalism exhibits domineering hierarchical structures such as that between an employer and an employee. Anna Morgenstern approaches this topic from the opposite perspective, arguing that anarcho-capitalists are not really capitalists because \"mass concentration of capital is impossible\" without the state. According to Jeremy Jennings, \"[i]t is hard not to conclude that these ideas\", referring to anarcho-capitalism, argued to have \"roots deep in classical liberalism\" more so than in anarchism, \"are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is\". For Jennings, \"anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual (as the 'anarcho-capitalists' appear to believe) but, as we have already seen, for the extension of individuality and community\". Similarly, Barbara Goodwin, Emeritus Professor of Politics at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, argues that anarcho-capitalism's \"true place is in the group of right-wing libertarians\", not in anarchism. Nonetheless, some right-libertarian scholars like Michael Huemer, who identify with the ideology, describe anarcho-capitalism as a \"variety of anarchism\". British author Andrew Heywood also believes that \"individualist anarchism overlaps with libertarianism and is usually linked to a strong belief in the market as a self-regulating mechanism, most obviously manifest in the form of anarcho-capitalism\".", "Similarly, Bob Black argues that an anarcho-capitalist wants to \"abolish the state to his own satisfaction by calling it something else\". He states that they do not denounce what the state does, they just \"object to who's doing it\".Bob Black (1992), \"The Libertarian As Conservative\", The Abolition of Work and Other Essays, p. 144 It has also been argued that anarcho-capitalism dissolves into city states. Randall G. Holcombe argues that anarcho-capitalism turns justice into a commodity as private defense and court firms would favour those who pay more for their services. He argues that defense agencies could form cartels and oppress people without fear of competition. Philosopher Albert Meltzer argued that since anarcho-capitalism promotes the idea of private armies, it actually supports a \"limited State\". He contends that it \"is only possible to conceive of Anarchism which is free, communistic and offering no economic necessity for repression of countering it\"."]}, {"page": "Individualist anarchism", "response": ["Murray Bookchin criticized individualist anarchism for its opposition to democracy and its embrace of \"lifestylism\" at the expense of anti-capitalism and class struggle.

Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993\u20131998. AK Press, 1999, p. 155. Albert Meltzer proposed that individualist anarchism differs radically from revolutionary anarchism and that it \"is sometimes too readily conceded 'that this is, after all, anarchism'\". Meltzer claimed that Benjamin Tucker's acceptance of the use of a private police force (including to break up violent strikes to protect the \"employer's 'freedom'\") is contradictory to the definition of anarchism as \"no government\". Meltzer opposed anarcho-capitalism for similar reasons, arguing that it actually supports a \"limited State\" and that \"it is only possible to conceive of Anarchism which is free, communistic and offering no economic necessity for repression of countering it\".Meltzer, Albert.

When in the 20th century several economists began to formulate a form of radical American libertarianism known as anarcho-capitalism, this has met resistance from those who hold that capitalism is inherently oppressive or statist and many anarchists and scholars do not consider anarcho-capitalism to properly cohere with the spirit, principles, or history of anarchism.Peter Marshall, Demanding the Impossible; John Clark, The Anarchist Moment; Albert Meltzer, Anarchism: Arguments for and Against; Noam Chomsky, Understanding Power, David Weick, Anarchist Justice; Brian Morris, \"Anthropology and Anarchism,\" Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed (no. 45); Peter Sabatini, Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy; Donald Rooum, What is Anarchism?; Bob Black, Libertarian as Conservative While other anarchists and scholars regard anarchism as referring only to opposition to the non-privatisation of all aspects of the state and do consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of anarchism,1) Perlin, Terry M.

Anarcho-capitalists believe that negative rights should be recognized as legitimate, but positive rights should be rejected.
