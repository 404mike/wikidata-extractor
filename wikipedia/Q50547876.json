He successfully completed the apprenticeship, having also studied in his spare time at the Glasgow School of Design, and travelled around the country, looking for work.By the mid-1860s, Maxwell had returned to Glasgow, where he became active in the local trade union movement.  He moved to Edinburgh early in the 1870s, and there he became active in the St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society.  In 1878, he was elected as its secretary, serving for four years.  This led him to prominence in the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society (SCWS), serving on its board from 1880, and as president from 1908 onwards.Maxwell was interested in co-operative production, and visited the United States in 1884 to study developments there.  On his return to Scotland, he led the construction of a series of factories in Shieldhall, making goods for the SCWS.  He served repeatedly as president of the Co-operative Congress, and in 1907 became president of the International Co-operative Alliance, serving until 1921.Maxwell was also interested in the political representation of the co-operative movement, and he stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal-Labour candidate in Glasgow Tradeston at the 1900 UK general election.  In 1910, he wrote the History of Co-operation in Scotland.  He was knighted in 1919, and retired from all his posts two years later, due to poor health.  He relocated to Rothesay, where he lived until his death in 1929.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Maxwell", "response": ["William Maxwell may refer to:", "*William Maxwell (engraver) (c. 1766\u20131809), printer of the Sentinel of the Northwest Territory newspaper in Cincinnati, Ohio", "*William Maxwell (educator) (1784\u20131857), seventh President of Hampden\u2013Sydney College", "*William Maxwell (physician) (1581\u20131641), Scottish physician", "*William Maxwell (Continental Army general) (1733\u20131796), Irish-born American soldier from New Jersey in the American Revolutionary War", "*Sir William Maxwell, 5th Baronet, of Monreith, British MP for Wigtownshire, 1805\u20131812 and 1822\u20131830", "*William Maxwell (Australian politician) (1867\u20131921), gold miner and member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*William Maxwell (co-operator) (1841\u20131929), Scottish co-operative activist", "*William Maxwell (railroad executive) (1794\u20131856), American business executive and politician, president of the Erie Railroad 1842\u20131843", "*William Maxwell (footballer) (1876\u20131940), Scottish footballer, manager of the Belgian national football team", "*William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale (1676\u20131744), Catholic nobleman", "*William Maxwell (journalist) (died 1928), British journalist, soldier, writer and civil servant", "*Charles William Maxwell (1775\u20131848), governor of the British crown colony of Sierra Leone 1811\u20131815"]}, {"page": "International Co-operative Alliance", "response": [":1907: Earl Grey and William Maxwell", ":1917: William Maxwell"]}, {"page": "List of presidents of Co-operative Congress", "response": ["| 1883 Edinburgh || Rt.
