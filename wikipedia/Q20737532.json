He scored 100 goals in 18-months with the club, prompting Norwich City to sign him. He scored twice in six Football League games for Norwich, before joining Colchester United. However, his time with Colchester was cut short due to the outbreak of World War II, and he moved to Lowestoft, where he appeared for Lowestoft Town and later Wellingborough Town.", "link_mentions": {}}}
