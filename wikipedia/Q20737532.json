He scored 100 goals in 18-months with the club, prompting Norwich City to sign him. He scored twice in six Football League games for Norwich, before joining Colchester United. However, his time with Colchester was cut short due to the outbreak of World War II, and he moved to Lowestoft, where he appeared for Lowestoft Town and later Wellingborough Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Law", "response": ["George Law may refer to:", "*George Law (financier) (1806\u20131881)", "*George Law Curry (1820\u20131878), governor of Oregon Territory", "*George Law (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "*George Law (footballer, born 1912) (1912\u20131970), English footballer for Norwich City", "*George Law (cricketer) (1846\u20131911)", "*SS George Law, an 1850s steamship"]}, {"page": "1939\u201340 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|George Law||CF||||Wellingborough||||0||0|| Norwich City||18 June 1939||\u00a3100", "|George Law", "|George Law", "|align=\"left\"|George Law", "|George Law"]}]}}
