Town slipped to ninth place in November, but retained the league title after only one more loss in the 27 remaining matches, after Chapman signed goalkeeper Billy Mercer to replace the injured Taylor. Huddersfield only conceded 28 goals in the league and they never conceded more than two in any league game, the first time a team accomplished this feat. Another notable feat was achieved in October 1924, as Billy Smith became the first player in history to score directly from a corner. After winning successive league titles, Herbert Chapman left for the more fashionable Arsenal, who offered to double his wages and attracted larger crowds than Huddersfield."]}, {"page": "Billy Mercer (footballer born 1892)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Mercer (footballer, born 1892)"]}]}}
