Holmes was initially not enthusiastic, since she \"couldn't imagine coming up with enough ideas\". She worked with the concept, however, expanding the storyline with elements of war, politics, revenge, doomed love, and religious conflict. Although the original plan was for a stand-alone novel, enough material was created for several books, and the publisher decided on a six-volume series. The first volume, Into the Wild, was written by Kate Cary under the pseudonym \"Erin Hunter\" and was completed in about three months. Holmes then began to work behind the scenes, editing and supervising details. Cherith Baldry joined the team to write the third book, Forest of Secrets.

In an online author chat, Cherith Baldry listed the authors that inspire her as including Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Shakespeare. In the same chat, Victoria Holmes stated that Jacqueline Wilson, Kathy Reichs, and J. K. Rowling are some of the authors that inspire her. According to the official website, other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton, Lucy Daniels, Ellis Peters, Tess Gerritsen,  Kate Ellis, Lisa Gardiner, and Meg Cabot. The authors have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration. The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place. Other influential locations include Loch Lomond, as well as the Scottish Highlands. Nicholas Culpeper, a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the Warriors series. His book, Culpeper's Herbal, is used as a source by the authors for the many herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, the authors suggested that they may use some fan-created character names in future books. The film series Rambo has also been cited as a source of inspiration.", "On 20 October 2016, Victoria Holmes announced that Alibaba Pictures had bought the production rights for a film adaptation with David Heyman as producer, and a movie poster was released.

First, if the authors used all of their own names, the books would be placed in different places in a library, making them hard to find. Second, they wanted to pick a surname that would place the books very close to the Redwall series by Brian Jacques, which was, at the time, the book series with the closest plot to Warriors. One of the authors suggested \"Hunter\", and the others found that it was \"perfect\" because not only did it place the book series close to Jacques, but it evokes the image of a cat.

Religion and loyalty are explored when the Clans meet the Tribe of Rushing Water, and Stormfur is torn between the Clans and Brook where Small Fish Swim, as well as when the Clans realize that Tribe cats believe in the Tribe of Endless Hunting and not StarClan.

Holmes stated that she \"was reluctant to create stories that [she] felt would be quite similar to Warriors. Dogs live in packs, they hunt for their food, they have a strict hierarchy within their communities, they guard their territories\". Several other animals, including horses, otters, and dolphins were considered, but were dismissed for various reasons; Holmes felt that horses tended to run away rather than stay and fight, which she believed would not make for very interesting interpersonal drama between characters, that dolphins would be too visually similar to tell apart from each other in a large cast of characters, and that otters did not have a broad enough audience appeal. Holmes ultimately decided that the series would be about bears, her reasoning being that bears are much more solitary, undomesticated animals and do not live in close-knit communities like feral cats.
