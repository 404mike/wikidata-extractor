He progressed to assistant manager to Frank Taylor and took his position in June 1960. He set about staving off the threat of relegation before bringing back club legend Stanley Matthews in an effort to rekindle the club's supporter base. It worked well and he had enough money to bring in a number of established veterans as Stoke took the Football League Second Division title in 1962\u201363 and reached the 1964 Football League Cup Final, losing out to Leicester City.\nMore fine signings followed as Stoke enjoyed great success at the beginning of the 1970s reaching two FA Cup semi-finals, playing in the UEFA Cup twice and winning their first major trophy, the Football League Cup in 1972. Stoke then nearly won the First Division in 1974\u201375 but after the Butler Street Stand roof fell off in a strong storm at the Victoria Ground Stoke had to sell their best players to cover the repair costs and a despondent Waddington quit in March 1977 with Stoke heading for relegation.

It was only some years later that Banks was informed that Stoke had actually made the payment, not Leicester. Waddington valued good goalkeepers highly, and the two built up a close relationship. During this time, Banks moved to Madeley, Staffordshire. He replaced John Farmer as the club's number one, and kept goal in the last four games of the 1966\u201367 season, making his home debut at the Victoria Ground in a 3\u20131 win over his former club Leicester."]}, {"page": "Geoff Hurst", "response": ["In January 1974, \"Potters\" manager Tony Waddington asked Hurst to take in new signing Alan Hudson as a lodger so as to provide the talented but troubled midfielder with a stable home during his Stoke career.

It was a fitting final bow as he always enjoyed playing against Arsenal, and he had \"so many wonderful memories\" at Highbury. With former teammate and close friend Jackie Mudie at Stoke City, and with Tony Waddington keen to welcome Matthews back to the Victoria Ground, his return to his home-town club was sealed. However Matthews was not impressed when the Blackpool board demanded a \u00a33,500 transfer fee, with one director being so bold as to tell him \"You forget.

The return of Matthews helped Stoke to an improved eighth position in 1961\u201362. Promotion was achieved in the following season, with Stoke finishing as champions. In their first season back in the top flight, 1963\u201364, Waddington guided Stoke to a mid-table finish.

At the age of 18 he faced Leeds United's FWA Footballer of the Year Bobby Collins in a reserve match, and despite Collins going as far as to punch him in the face Smith managed to last the entire match without backing down in an extremely physical contest. However, for a period Waddington banned Smith from playing against first-team players in training as he feared Smith would injure one of his players. He made his first-team debut in the Football League against Arsenal in September 1968, and was given the task of man-marking Bobby Gould. He gave away a penalty after fouling Jon Sammels, which Terry Neill converted for the only goal of the match, but otherwise made a solid debut. However, in his second appearance he gave away two penalties in a 3\u20131 defeat away to Ipswich Town, and had to wait five months for another first-team appearance. In March 1969, Alan Bloor picked up a knock and Smith returned to the starting line-up in a 5\u20131 defeat to Leeds, failing in his task to man mark Mick Jones, who claimed a hat-trick.

He made a decent start to his Stoke career scoring five goals towards the end of the 1961\u201362 season meaning that hopes were high for 1962\u201363. While six games without a win heralded another poor start for Stoke, Viollet kick-started Stoke's season with four goals against Charlton Athletic on 12 September.

After two years in the reserves he made his debut against West Ham United at Upton Park, helping Stoke keep a clean sheet against World Cup winner Geoff Hurst. He took over from the disappointing Alex Elder and established himself in the first team. Pejic was a strong athlete with a sweet left foot and was compactly built at 5\u00a0ft 8in. Pejic was a 'hard player' and was a strong tackler who enjoyed letting his opposing winger know he was around with a scything tackle.
