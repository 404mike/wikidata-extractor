As a teenager he began studies at the Liverpool College of Art, where he became friends with John Lennon and, like Lennon, began copying the American R&B music imported through the city. In 1961 he joined The Undertakers, one of the leading local Merseybeat bands, as lead guitarist, shortly before Jackie Lomax joined as the group's singer.The Undertakers released a string of singles in the early 1960s and toured widely, but had little chart success.  They split up in the United States in 1965, and Huston stayed behind.  Initially he toured as a member of Joey Dee and the Starliters, before linking up with The Young Rascals to start a new career as a record producer and engineer.As engineer, he won a gold disc for the Rascals' \"Groovin'\", and in the late 1960s engineered a string of successful albums with The Who, Led Zeppelin, Todd Rundgren, Patti LaBelle and H.P. Lovecraft.  He worked particularly extensively with Eric Burdon and War on their albums through the 1970s and 1980s, winning a Grammy Nomination for The World Is a Ghetto (1973).  He also worked with James Brown, Ben E. King and many others.Huston has subsequently become a consultant and lecturer on acoustics, building design, recording techniques and record production, based near Nashville, Tennessee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Led Zeppelin II", "response": ["The album used a wide variety of recording studios in the UK and the US.

A more favourable set-up was Mystic Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles with Chris Huston engineering. Lead singer Robert Plant later complained that the writing, recording, and mixing sessions were done in many different locations, and criticized the writing and recording process. \"Thank You\", \"The Lemon Song\" and \"Moby Dick\" were overdubbed during the tour, while the mixing of \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Heartbreaker\" was also done on tour.

It was recorded by Tom Dowd and Chris Huston on Friday, June 23, 1967, at the Stax studio in Memphis. Though all but one member of the group were black (Ronnie Caldwell being the only white member), the album cover art, by Loring Eutemey, suggests an interracial pop music party feeling. The instrumental band, after being signed in early 1967, was tutored by Al Jackson, Jr. and the other members of Booker T. & the M.G.'s, which shows in the tightness of the rhythm section. That summer they also were selected by Otis Redding as his new backup band.https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-bar-kays/id382848"]}]}}
