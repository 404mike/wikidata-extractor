After an argument between Drever's father and their landlord, he evicted the family from their home. Drever's family then migrated to Stromness. He was a rather delicate and sickly child who quickly grew fond of reading. Drever was gifted with the ability to learn and memorize things rapidly as well as retain the information. He could repeat several pages of his favorite author's works. At age fourteen Drever was indentured for four years as a pupil-teacher. He assisted the headmaster of the school for two years before breaking his indenture. Drever was willing to pay the penalty because he felt that he was wasting his time in regards to his own education.Drever, J. (1932). James Drever. In C.

Around this same time Drever spent a few months in 1908 and 1909 visiting secondary schools in Germany. What he studied was the German methods of training both primary and secondary teachers. The main reason for these visits to Germany was that they wanted to institute a new course in present-day educational systems and problems at the University of Edinburgh. Drever had been put in charge of developing this course. Another result of this research was the publication of several papers on German education in School.
