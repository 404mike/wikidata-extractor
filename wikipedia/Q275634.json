Rideout had been a doubt for the game with a knee ligament injury and appeared to have suffered a recurrence midway through the second half; after receiving treatment from the Everton physio, Rideout indicated he was ready to return to action, but Amokachi misinterpreted his signal and entered the field, with the substitution confirmed by the fourth official."]}, {"page": "1994 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|RB ||2 || Earl Barrett"]}, {"page": "Earl (given name)", "response": ["* Earl Barrett (born 1967), English former footballer"]}, {"page": "1993 U.S. Cup", "response": ["England: Tim Flowers, Earl Barrett, Des Walker, Gary Pallister, Tony Dorigo, Andy Sinton, David Batty (Platt 46'), Nigel Clough (Merson 82'), Paul Ince (Palmer 67'), Lee Sharpe, Ian Wright", "England: Nigel Martyn, Earl Barrett, Gary Pallister (Keown 53'), Des Walker, David Platt, Paul Ince, Nigel Clough (Wright 70'), Andy Sinton, Paul Merson, John Barnes, Lee Sharpe (Winterburn 46')"]}, {"page": "History of Aston Villa F.C.
