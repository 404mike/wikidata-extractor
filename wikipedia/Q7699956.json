Led once again by the defense captained by 2007 and 2008 MAAC Defensive Player of the Year Tennant McVea and including goalkeeper Milos Kocic, these Greyhounds demonstrated offensive firepower as well with the likes of Jamie Darvill and Phil Bannister, and the team continued its success in the 2008 campaign, going undefeated in the regular season and earning a ranking as high as #6 in the nation before two upset defeats (in the MAAC final against Fairfield and in the NCAA Second Round against UNC Greensboro) prematurely ended the season.  Loyola is well positioned for a strong start in the 2009 season, with two seniors and one junior named on the 2009 Men's Missouri Athletic Club Hermann Trophy Watch List.
