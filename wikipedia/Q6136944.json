It is one of two SSSIs located on the Ford & Etal estate which were originally two separate estates combined in 1908 when James Joicey, 1st Baron Joicey purchased them both. Access can be gained by heading south off the B6353 (vehicles must be left at the gate of the site) and although there are a some good footpaths for the general public, permits are required to enter certain parts. The 71.6 hectare site, situated around  above sea level, is made up partly (46 hectares) of a raised bog of peat, which is up to  deep in places and underlain by carboniferous limestone some 363 to 325 million years ago. The bog, or mire, was a rainfed lake at some point in its history of which the build up of vegetation outstripped that of decomposition, giving it its 'raised' aspect. A report to the Government Office of the North East (GONE) stated that \"although partly drained, the re-wetted surface contains many waterlogged areas,\" that \"the water table should normally be within 25cm of the surface\" and that the water quality was \"good.\"The 2006 report prepared by Treweek Environmental Consultants  Flora include heather, cotton grass, hares tail and cross-leaved heath and fauna to be found are red squirrels, roe deer, curlew, red grouse and adders amongst others. The first Northumberian sightings of the solitary bee \"Colletes succinctus\" were made around the bog in 2007. To the south of the bog is found ancient woodland containing Scots Pine, birch and willow trees."]}]}}
