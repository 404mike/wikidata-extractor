Newsreader Jon Snow does not wear a poppy on-screen for similar reasons. He too was criticised and he condemned what he saw as \"poppy fascism\". Well-known war-time journalist Robert Fisk published in November 2011 a personal account about the shifting nature of wearing a poppy, titled \"Do those who flaunt the poppy on their lapels know that they mock the war dead?\". While all newsreaders in the UK are expected to wear the remembrance poppy, those on the BBC World News service are told not to. The BBC say this is because the symbol is not widely recognised overseas. The Royal British Legion condemned this, insisting that the poppy is the \"international symbol of remembrance\"."]}, {"page": "60 Seconds", "response": ["This can be used as a stepping stone as James Dagwell moved to BBC World News and the simulcast between BBC World News and BBC News Channel overnight as a presenter.
