Ford co-produced the album with Richard Salt. Dispirited by hardcore music and the contemporary house scene, Ford decided to create an album that explored moods and emotions, while combining elements of his acid house work. The resulting album is eclectic and explores styles of techno, funk and disco, as well as featuring Ford's soft vocals.", "Baby Ford (real name Peter Ford) began his career in the late 1980s where he was a founder of the British acid house movement, taking influence from Chicago house producers like Ron Trent, Larry Heard, and Marshall Jefferson and releasing material on the label Rhythm King. His 1988 single \"Oochy Koochy\" was one of the most prominently heard tracks in UK acid house, despite the producer being unknown. Nonetheless, as Ford rose in stature, interest in his music became less pronounced. Prior to BFORD 9, the producer released the albums Ford Trax in 1988 and 'Ooo' The World of Baby Ford in 1990, the former of which had become popular with many disc jockeys.", "In the United Kingdom, BFORD 9 was released on 18 May 1992 by the label Insumision on CD and as a limited edition double LP. In the United States, it was released in June by Sire Records. To promote the album, \"In Your Blood\" and \"Fetish\" were released as singles, and in May and June, Baby Ford played live dates in the UK with eON, Colin Favor and Colin Dale. In a contemporary review, Ted Kessler of Select gave BFORD 9 a perfect score, saying \"Ford successfully straddles the entire frame of dance, avoiding much of the categorisation that dogs current thinking in the techno world.\" He felt that Ford's frail voice, which he wrote was \"part MC 900 Foot Jesus, part yearning adolescent alien,\" ensured that the album explored \"a full spectrum of emotions\". He concluded that \"while the development of House is still in its infancy, Baby Ford is well ahead of the pack.\"", "Colleague Andew Harrison wrote that the album was the first to successfully combine disco, techno and \"oblique atmospherics\" under the \"acid banner.\" He also described \"Fetish\" as a \"white noise stomperama\", calling it \"easily the best Baby Ford record since 'Oochy Koochy'.\" Billboard felt that the album would \"add a shot of musical integrity\" to the rave movement, commenting how the \"assaulting\" music is \"wisely\" spiced with sound and vocal effects and hooks. In a retrospective review, Ned Raggett of AllMusic said that the album \"had its moments of invigorating house/techno heaven given a fine combination of dirt and sheen.\" Nonetheless, he felt the album's opening tracks were its strongest, rendering it \"another in the long line of dance albums that fails to maintain its strength over its length.\" He concluded that the album was \"uneven but still interesting.\" Sean Cooper of AllMusic called \"Fetish\" a \"classic cut.\"", "All tracks written by Baby Ford.", "*Baby Ford \u2013 writing, production, mixing (tracks 1, 2, 5\u201314)", "Category:Baby Ford albums"]}]}}
