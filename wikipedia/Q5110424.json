The copies were published in full colour as the first publication of London's fledgling India Society. More than the earlier copies, these aimed to fill in holes and damage to recreate the original condition rather than record the state of the paintings as she was seeing them. According to one writer, unlike the paintings created by her predecessors Griffiths and Gill, whose copies were influenced by British Victorian styles of painting, those of the Herringham expedition preferred an 'Indian Renascence' aesthetic of the type pioneered by Abanindranath Tagore.Rupert Richard Arrowsmith, \"An Indian Renascence and the rise of global modernism: William Rothenstein in India, 1910\u201311\", The Burlington Magazine, vol.152 no.1285 (April 2010), pp.228\u2013235."]}, {"page": "William Rothenstein", "response": ["Rothenstein maintained a lifelong fascination for Indian sculpture and painting, and in 1910 set out on a seminal tour of the subcontinent's major artistic and religious sites.

He subsequently contributed a chapter on their importance to the published edition.

Their collections have been enhanced with additional acquisitions and commissions. Following the death of Herringham part of her eclectic art collection, including paintings by her and other women artists as well as Indian miniatures and Japanese woodblock prints, was given to Bedford College by her husband.
