Gibson had realised that nationalist politics needed to be connected to everyday issues in order to become popular.  This strain of thought was prominent within the NPS and many former Scots National League members drifted from it due to their belief that the NPS was too moderate.  This included Ruairidh Erskine himself, who drifted entirely from politics."]}]}}
