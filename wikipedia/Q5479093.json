The concept arose soon after Gautama Buddha's death, with a number of earlier Buddhist schools accepting the existence of such an intermediate state, while other schools rejected it. The concept of antar\u0101bhava, an intervening state between death and rebirth, was brought into Buddhism from the Vedic-Upanishadic (later Hindu) philosophical tradition.John Bowker, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, s.v. Bryan Jar\u00e9 Cuevas, \"Predecessors and Prototypes: Towards a Conceptual History of the Buddhist Antar\u0101bhava\", Numen 43:3:263-302 (September 1996)  Later Buddhism expanded the bardo concept to six or more states of consciousness covering every stage of life and death.Francesca Fremantle (2001), ", "Fremantle (2001) states that there are six traditional bardo states known as the Six Bardos:  the Bardo of This Life (p.\u00a055); the Bardo of Meditation (p.\u00a058); the Bardo of Dream (p.\u00a062); the Bardo of Dying (p.\u00a064); the Bardo of Dharmata (p.\u00a065); and the Bardo of Existence (p.\u00a066).Francesca Fremantle (2001), Luminous Emptiness, p.55-66, Boston: Shambala Publications.  ", "Originally bardo referred only to the period between one life and the next, and this is still its normal meaning when it is mentioned without any qualification.  There was considerable dispute over this theory during the early centuries of Buddhism, with one side arguing that rebirth (or conception) follows immediately after death, and the other saying that there must be an interval between the two. With the rise of mahayana, belief in a transitional period prevailed.  Later Buddhism expanded the whole concept to distinguish six or more similar states, covering the whole cycle of life, death, and rebirth.  But it can also be interpreted as any transitional experience, any state that lies between two other states.  Its original meaning, the experience of being between death and rebirth, is the prototype of the bardo experience, while the six traditional bardos show how the essential qualities of that experience are also present in other transitional periods.  By refining even further the understanding of the essence of bardo, it can then be applied to every moment of existence.  The present moment, the now, is a continual bardo, always suspended between the past and the future.Francesca Fremantle (2001), "]}, {"page": "Adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na", "response": ["Francesca Fremantle gives an etymology of Sanskrit adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na and Tibetan jinlap: \"The Sanskrit word literally means \"standing over\" and conveys ideas of taking possession, dwelling within, presence, protection, and sovereignty.
