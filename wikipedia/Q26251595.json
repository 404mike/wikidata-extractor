Two days later on-loan forward Dominic Poleon was recalled by his parent club, Leeds United, while Erik T\u00f8nne was allowed to join Norwegian side HamKam on loan until November 2013. An away trip to Walsall provided yet another draw for United, with a second half goal from Chris Porter rescuing a point for the Blades. United continued their disappointing home form into the following game when Crawley Town were 2\u20130 victors, a result that saw Danny Wilson sacked the following day, and being replaced by reserve team coach Chris Morgan for the remainder of the season. The following day the club announced former player and Academy coach, David Unsworth as assistant to Morgan for the duration of his tenure. The new management team's first action was to recall Jordan Chapell from his loan spell at Torquay United. Chris Morgan's first game in charge saw Swindon Town visit Bramall Lane, with United running out as 2\u20130 winners, thanks to goals from Porter and Kitson. Following an injury to one of his Achilles tendons, Richard Cresswell returned early from his loan at York City, the day before a dramatic game home against Brentford saw three players sent off and four penalties awarded as the teams played out a 2\u20132 draw. On the penultimate weekend of the season United, saw their hopes of automatic promotion extinguished as they were beaten 3\u20130 by already relegated Portsmouth, although results elsewhere confirmed their place in the play-offs. Their poor form continued with a 1\u22120 away loss Crewe Alexandra, followed by yet another 0\u20130 home draw against Preston North End in the final game of the regular season. Meanwhile, Academy prospects Conor Dimaio and Jamie McDonagh were called up to the Ireland under\u201318s and the Northern Ireland under\u201319s respectively, while young defender Harry Maguire was named as the club's Player of the Year and was named in the PFA League One Team of the Year, winning both for the second season in succession.", "||\u2013|| MF || Jamie McDonagh||align=left| Northern Ireland U19 ||Friendly||align=left| Wales U19|||| || ||"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["On the eve of the new season, coach and former assistant manager David Unsworth left the club, and later the same day Irish youngster Aaron Barry was allowed to join Scottish Championship club Dumbarton on loan until the end of January to gain first team experience. In celebration of The Football League's 125 anniversary, United featured in a televised opening fixture against Notts County in recognition of County being the oldest league club in the world, while Bramall Lane is the oldest football ground in the world. With Febian Brandy, Conor Coady, Stephen McGinn and Lyle Taylor all making their d\u00e9buts, United triumphed 2\u20131 in the midst of a thunderstorm. In the next match United were knocked out in the first round of the League Cup by Burton Albion almost a year ago to the day to exactly the same fixture and outcome to the previous season. On 8 August George Long was called up to the England U21 team for a friendly match against Scotland U21s, and on the same day, Erik T\u00f8nne was recalled from his loan at HamKam so that he could sign for Sandnes Ulf on a permanent basis, ending his career with United. United's preparations for their next league game, away to Brentford were disrupted when Wolverhampton Wanderers had a bid accepted for midfielder Kevin McDonald, having triggered a release clause in his contract. United lost the subsequent fixture 3\u20131, and after lengthy negotiations, McDonald finally departed for an undisclosed fee on 14 August. The following day, Jamie McDonagh fractured his leg in two places whilst on international duty for Northern Ireland U19s, requiring acute surgery. Back in the league United were held to a 1\u20131 draw by Colchester United at Bramall Lane, followed by a 2\u20130 reverse at Bradford City. On 29 August Danny Higginbotham joined Chester after falling out of United's first team reckoning, while later the same day Jose Baxter joined from Oldham Athletic for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal.
