He is a noted opponent of the European Union and a donor of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). He previously supported the Conservative Party, but left because of the party's support of the Maastricht Treaty.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UK Independence Party", "response": ["UKIP has several high-profile backers. In March 2009, the Conservative Party's biggest-ever donor, Stuart Wheeler, donated \u00a3100,000 to UKIP after criticising Cameron's stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon. He was then expelled from the Conservatives and in 2011 appointed treasurer of UKIP. In October 2014, Arron Banks, who previously gave \u00a325,000 to the Conservatives, increased his UKIP donation from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a31\u00a0million after Hague said he had never heard of him. The multi-millionaire Paul Sykes has helped finance the party, donating over \u00a31\u00a0million to their 2014 campaign at the European Parliament."]}, {"page": "Referendum Party", "response": ["Immediately after the election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been suffering from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing in the election would shorten his life. He died in Benahavis, Spain, on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly afterwards. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a pressure group closely associated with the former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic cause was weakened; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU was considered as distant as it had been in 1995."]}, {"page": "Robert Kilroy-Silk", "response": ["Following this, businessman and friend Paul Sykes announced his intention to cease his partial funding of UKIP and to return his support to the Conservatives, as he feared that the Euro-sceptic vote might be split. The branch chairmen of UKIP were canvassed on their opinion regarding Kilroy-Silk's challenge for the party leadership. Only a minority (13%) were sympathetic to him; Kilroy-Silk did not think this was significant, as he believed that too few party members had been consulted. Party officials threatened him with disciplinary action if he continued his challenge."]}, {"page": "Democracy Movement", "response": ["The Democracy Movement was founded in 1998 through a merger of the Referendum Movement, a cross-party successor group to Sir James Goldsmith's Referendum Party, and the Euro Information Campaign set up by Yorkshire businessman Paul Sykes.", "The DM is funded by donations from grassroots supporters, although the Goldsmith family and Paul Sykes made large campaign donations during its early years.", "The Democracy Movement played the major grassroots role in the campaign to 'keep the pound', from launch quickly establishing a large crossparty network of supporters and branches ready to campaign against euro membership in the referendum that was then promised. Its then chairman Paul Sykes pledged to spend \u00a320 million on the campaign and the Movement claimed to be distributing \"millions\" of pro-pound leaflets through a series of 'Democracy Days' of national, concerted action by its branches."]}, {"page": "Lady Annabel Goldsmith", "response": ["Inspired by Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy's radio address during the Hungarian Revolution, in November 1956, she and Mark Birley volunteered with the Save the Children organisation in Vienna.  She organised charitable donations and travelled daily to look after refugees who crossed the Austrian border into the frontier town of Andau. In May 1997, she campaigned with her second husband in Putney, the constituency unsuccessfully contested by Goldsmith for his Referendum Party. She continued to support her husband's ideas, like the single currency referendum, after his death as part of the Referendum Movement, which was headed by Paul Sykes and Lord McAlpine and of which she became honorary president."]}, {"page": "Planet Online", "response": ["Planet Online was a UK business-to-business Internet Service Provider.
