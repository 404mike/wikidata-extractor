The design of the fort commenced in 1862 and was overseen by 22-year-old Anglo-Irish Lieutenant John Charles Ardagh, working from an office in Brighton.Newhaven Fort - Lieutenant Ardagh - The man who built the Fort  The site selected was on cliffs overlooking the harbour called Castle Hill, which was already occupied by a battery which originated in the mid-16th century. Instead of levelling the site, as was customary, Ardagh designed the fort to conform to the existing contours. A 40 foot wide moat protected the northern and western sides of the fort, which were lined with concrete, the first time this material had been used to any extent in a British fortification.Sutherland, R. J. M., Humm, Dawn and Chrimes, Mike (2001) Historic Concrete: The Background to Appraisal Thomas Telford Publishing,  (p. 373)  The junction of the northern and western arms of the moat was protected by a counterscarp gallery and a sally port. The eastern side overlooking the harbour was protected by a short wet moat and by the embankment of the harbour. A caponier at the foot of the chalk cliffs was reached by a tunnel from within the fort. The garrison was to be housed in casemated barracks built into the northern and western ramparts.Victorian Forts - Datasheets - Newhaven Fort The main entrance at the north east angle was accessed by an \"Equilibrium Bridge\" designed and patented by Ardagh himself."]}, {"page": "London Defence Positions", "response": ["The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom report on Britain's defences believed that London was practically undefendable; they proposed a fort at Shooters Hill to defend the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, but it was never acted upon.
