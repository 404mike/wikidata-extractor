He was well known for his invention of numerous analog circuit concepts, holding over 100 patents worldwide, and for the discovery of the Translinear Principle. His name is attributed to a class of related topologies loosely referred to as the Gilbert cell, one of which is a mixer - a key frequency translation device - used in every modern wireless communication device. A similar topology, for use as a synchronous demodulator, was invented by Howard Jones in 1963.Gilbert was born in Bournemouth, England. During the 1950s he pursued an interest in solid-state devices while at Mullard, working on the development of early transistors, and later, the first-generation planar ICs. After some pioneering development of sampling oscillography he emigrated to the United States in 1964 to pursue this interest at Tektronix, Beaverton, Oregon, where he developed the first electronic knob-readout system and other advances in instrumentation. He returned to England in 1970, where he was Group Leader at Plessey Research Laboratories, managing a team developing OCR systems and integrated circuits (ICs) for communications applications. From 1972-1977 he consulted for Analog Devices Inc., Wilmington, MA, designing several ICs embodying novel nonlinear concepts. He returned to the USA and Tektronix in 1977  to pursue HF ICs and process development.\nIn 1979, Analog Devices allowed Gilbert to create the first remote design center for the Company, in Oregon, to persuade him to rejoin the company as their first Fellow.  This center developed into the Northwest Labs.\nOn February 4, 2020, Analog Devices announced that Gilbert had died.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Beaverton, Oregon", "response": ["*Barrie Gilbert \u2013 inventor"]}, {"page": "Analog Devices", "response": ["Barrie Gilbert was named the first Technology Fellow of Analog Devices in 1979.Lucinda Mattera, Electronic Design. \"Hall-Of-Famers Ponder The Future Of Electronics Engineering .\" September 13, 2004.

By using this exponential relationship, this class of circuits can implement multiplication, amplification and power-law relationships. When Barrie Gilbert described this class of circuits he also described the translinear principle (TLP) which made the analysis of these circuits possible in a way that the simplified view of BJTs as linear current amplifiers did not allow. TLP was later extended to include other elements that obey an exponential current-voltage relationship (such as CMOS transistors in weak inversion)."]}, {"page": "IEEE Donald O.

This is a technique described by Barrie Gilbert in several papers around mid 1970th, and in particular his Translinear Circuits from 1981. With this method circuits can be analyzed as a set of well-defined functions in steady-state, and such circuits assembled into complex networks."]}, {"page": "List of American scientists", "response": ["* Barrie Gilbert"]}, {"page": "Jim Williams (analog designer)", "response": ["*Barrie Gilbert"]}, {"page": "List of members of the National Academy of Engineering (Electronics)", "response": ["|Barrie Gilbert"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2020", "response": ["*Barrie Gilbert, 82, English-American inventor.Remembering Barrie Gilbert"]}, {"page": "Blackmer gain cell", "response": ["The earliest solid-state VCA topology was an attenuator rather than an amplifier; it employed a junction field-effect transistor in voltage-controlled resistance mode.

In 1968, Barrie Gilbert invented the Gilbert cell that was quickly adopted by radio and analog computer designers but lacked the precision required for studio equipment. Between 1970 and 1973, David E. Blackmer invented and patented the four-transistor multiplying log-antilog cell, targeting professional audio.
