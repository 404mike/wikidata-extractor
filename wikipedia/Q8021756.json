The club was reformed as \"Leicester City Football Club\", particularly appropriate as the borough of Leicester had recently been given city status. Following the name change, the club enjoyed moderate success in the 1920s; under the management of Peter Hodge, who left in May 1926 to be replaced two months later by Willie Orr, and with record goalscorer Arthur Chandler in the side, they won the Division Two title in 1924\u201325 and recorded their second-highest league finish in 1928\u201329 as runners-up by a single point to The Wednesday. However the 1930s saw a downturn in fortunes, with the club relegated in 1934\u201335 and, after promotion in 1936\u201337, another relegation in 1938\u201339 would see them finish the decade in Division Two."]}, {"page": "Falkirk F.C.", "response": ["|Willie Orr - Managerial Period & Record, bettermeddle.org.uk.
