Scipio's march from Troy to the Hyrcanian plain, that the Caicus was the north-eastern branch of the river of Pergamon which flows by Menduria (possibly Gergitha) and Bal\u0131kesir (Caesaraea).William Martin Leake. Asia Minor, p. 269. The Caicus as it seems is formed by two streams which meet between 50 and 65\u00a0km above its mouth, and it drains an extensive and fertile country. Strabo (p.\u00a0616) says that the sources of the Caicus are in a plain separated by the range of Temnos from the plain of Apiae, and that the plain of Apia lies above the plain of Thebe in the interior. He adds that there also flows from Tetanus a river (the Mysius) which joins the Caicus below its source. The Caicus enters the sea approximately 12\u00a0km from Pitane, and 3\u00a0km from Elaea. Elaea was the port of Pergamon, which was on the Caicus, approximately 25\u00a0km from Elaea.Strabo p. 615.

There are also Hellenic remains at Sk\u00e1la (\u03a3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1) or wharf upon the bay, from which persons usually embark for Euboea: this place is also called \u1f10\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f01\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, from a ruined church dedicated to the Holy Apostles. William Martin Leake originally placed Oropus at Oropos and Delphinium at Sk\u00e1la; but in the second edition of his Demi he leaves the position of Oropus doubtful. It seems, however, most probable that Oropus originally stood upon the coast, and was removed inland only for a short time. In the Peloponnesian War Thucydides speaks of sailing to and anchoring at Oropus;, 8.95. and Pausanias, as we have already seen, expressly states that Oropus was upon the coast. Hence there can be little doubt that Sk\u00e1la is the site of Oropus, and that Oropos is the inland site which the Oropians occupied only for a time. It is true that the distance of Oropos from the sea is more than double the 7 stadia assigned by Diodorus, but it is possible that he may have originally written 17 stadia. If Oropus stood at Sk\u00e1la, Delphinium must have been more to the eastward nearer the confines of Attica.

The principal gate was situated upon the narrow ridge already mentioned, and is still preserved; and adjoining it is the southern wall, about  in height. At the head of a narrow glen, which leads to the principal gate, stand the ruins of the temple of Nemesis upon a large artificial platform, supported by a wall of pure white marble. But we find upon this platform, which formed the temenos (\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) or sacred enclosure, the remains of two temples, which are almost contiguous, and nearly though not quite parallel to each other. The larger building was a peripteral hexastyle,  long and  broad, with 12 columns on the side, and with a pronaus, cella, and posticum in the usual manner. The smaller temple was  feet long by  feet broad, and consisted only of a cella, with a portico containing two Doric columns in antis. Among the ruins of the larger temple are some fragments of a colossal statue, corresponding in size with that of the Rhamnusian Nemesis; but these fragments were made of Attic marble, and not of Parian stone as stated by Pausanias. It is, however, not improbable, as William Martin Leake, who visited the site in the early 19th century, has remarked, that the story of the block of stone brought by the Persians was a fable, or an invention of the priests of Nemesis by which Pausanias was deceived. Among the ruins of the smaller temple was found a fragment, wanting the head and shoulders, of a statue of the human size in the archaic style of the Aeginetan school. This statue is now in the British Museum. Judging from this statue, as well as from the diminutive size and ruder architecture of the smaller temple, the latter appears to have been the more ancient of the two. Hence it has been inferred that the smaller temple was anterior to the Greco-Persian War, and was destroyed by the Persians just before the Battle of Marathon; and that the larger temple was erected in honour of the goddess, who had taken vengeance upon the insolence of the barbarians for outraging her worship. In front of the smaller temple are two chairs (\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9) of white marble, upon one of which is the inscription \u039d\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03a3\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd, and upon the other (\u0398\u03ad\u03bc\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9 \u03a3\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ad\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd, which has led some to suppose that the smaller temple was dedicated to Themis. But it is more probable that both temples were dedicated to Nemesis, and that the smaller temple was in ruins before the larger was erected. A difficulty, however, arises about the time of the destruction of the smaller temple, from the fact that the forms of the letters and the long vowels in the inscriptions upon the chairs clearly show that those inscriptions belong to an era long subsequent to the battle of Marathon. Christopher Wordsworth considered it ridiculous to suppose that these chairs were dedicated in this temple after its destruction, and hence conjectures that the temple was destroyed towards the close of the Peloponnesian War by the Persian allies of Sparta.William Martin Leake, Demi of Attica, p. 105, et seq., 2nd ed.; Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 434, et seq.; Christopher Wordsworth, Athens and Attica, p. 34, et seq.; Unedited Antiquities of Attica, c. vi. p. 41, et seq."]}, {"page": "John Howard Marsden", "response": ["*A Brief Memoir of the Life and Writings of Lieutenant-Colonel William Martin Leake, F.R.S., privately printed, London, 1864, on William Martin Leake.
