He may have been introduced to Swedenborgianism by his first employer, despite claiming to have regularly attended Anglican services during his apprenticeship.  Becoming more openly an evangelical dissenter, from about 1801 he attended Itinerant Society meetings, a few years later began to preach publicly and organise a Sunday school. In 1807 he was baptised at the Grafton Street congregation under the ministry of its minister, the Revd Richard Burnham.  Tried and approved as a preacher there, he admired William Huntington's high Calvinism, though it is unclear that this led, as his detractors claimed, to his practising Huntingdon's \"practical antinomianism\" or showing wanton disregard for accepted Christian morality."]}, {"page": "Richard Burnham", "response": ["Richard Burnham may refer to:", "*Richard Burnham (clergyman) (1711\u20131752), English clergyman and biographer", "*Richard Burnham (minister) (1749\u20131810), English Baptist minister and hymn-writer"]}, {"page": "Richard Burnham (baptist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Burnham (minister)"]}]}}
