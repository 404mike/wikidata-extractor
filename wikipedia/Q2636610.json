In 1952, she had met an aspiring actor, Roger Moore. The lyrics of \"I'm Walking Behind You\" concern a protagonist walking behind a former lover on their wedding day, and were written by Reid upon his learning that Squires had begun a relationship with the younger Moore. She wanted to record Reid's composition, but her A&R man at Columbia Records, Ray Martin, did not like it, and refused to record the song. Squires discovered that she was not under contract to Columbia, and hired a studio to record the song, paying for the session \u2013 scheduled for 27 February \u2013 herself.
