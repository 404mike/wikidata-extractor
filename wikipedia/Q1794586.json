Three days later, Argyle had better fortunes on the road, beating AFC Wimbledon 2\u20131 with goals from Onismor Bhasera, just 12 seconds into the game, and Nick Chadwick either side of a Jack Midson goal for the Dons. A visit to the Don Valley Stadium was next, where a penalty given away by Darren Purse saw Lewis Grabban score to earn Rotherham United all three points. The next week, the pendulum swung once again, with Paul Wotton scoring his first goal since returning to Argyle in a 1\u20130 win over Shrewsbury Town, lifting the Greens out of the bottom two once again. Next up was the visit of Bristol Rovers, who took a first half lead through Matt Harrold, only for Maxime Blanchard to equalise late on for the hosts, which saw Argyle rise to 21st position in the table. Argyle completed the loan signing of Steve Fletcher from AFC Bournemouth, who sat out Argyle's 0\u20130 draw away to Northampton Town, before making his debut as a substitute in a 1\u20130 win at home to Bradford City, where Juvhel Tsoumou's goal saw Argyle claim the three points, to sit on forty points for the season.", "|align=\"left\"|Nick Chadwick", "|Nick Chadwick", "|Nick Chadwick"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["* Nick Chadwick \u2013 Everton, loan"]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Nick Chadwick (born 1982), played for Plymouth Argyle."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 York City F.C. season", "response": ["York recorded their first win in eight matches after defeating Rochdale 3\u20132 away, with Michael Potts scoring twice and Walker scoring once in the first half.
