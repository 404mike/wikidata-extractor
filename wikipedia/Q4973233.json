Educated at Eton College, he served in the Life Guards during the First World War. His elder brother, Edward Archibald Beauchamp, was killed in the war and Brograve therefore succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1925. Sir Brograve died on 25 August 1976 at the age of 79, when the title became extinct.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
