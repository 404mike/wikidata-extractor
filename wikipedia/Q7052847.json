Tapken (21 February 1913 \u2013 June 1996) was an English footballer whose regular position was as a goalkeeper. Born in Wallsend, Northumberland, he began his career with local club Wallsend Thermal Welfare, before joining Newcastle United in May 1933. After taking over from Mick Burns as Newcastle's first-choice goalkeeper during the 1934\u201335 season, he went on to make a total of 106 appearances for Newcastle before joining Manchester United in December 1938 for a fee of \u00a3850.Taking over from regular goalkeeper Jack Breedon, Tapken made his debut for the club at home to Leicester City on Boxing Day 1938; he kept a clean sheet as Manchester United won 3\u20130. He retained the number one jersey for the next two months, but a run of four games at the end of February 1939 in which he conceded 16 goals saw Tommy Breen take over. Tapken returned to duty for three games at the start of April, but a 3\u20131 defeat to Leeds United resulted in Breedon step in again for the final four games of the season.During the Second World War, Tapken played in the Wartime League for his old club, Newcastle United (nine appearances), and Sunderland (two appearances) in 1942\u201343, before finding more regular action with Darlington (32 appearances) in 1943\u201344. In 1944\u201345, as well as playing for Darlington (six appearances), he turned out for Aldershot (three appearances), Brighton & Hove Albion (two appearances) and Chester (one appearance). He played one more season in the Wartime League with Darlington (six appearances), before returning to play 12 matches for Manchester United.However, with the resumption of The Football League in August 1946, Tapken \u2013 now 34 years old \u2013 was unable to regain his place in the Manchester United first team, and in April 1947, he moved to Darlington on a permanent basis. He missed just 11 games in the 1947\u201348 season, but his performances could not help Darlington to any higher than 16th place in the Third Division North. At the end of the season, he joined Irish club Shelbourne, where he spent one season before retiring from the game; it turned out to be his most successful season as a professional, as the team won the League of Ireland Shield, the Leinster Cup and finished as runners-up in the League of Ireland and the FAI Cup, while Tapken himself was selected for two League of Ireland XI matches against the Irish Football League (Northern Ireland).In July 1952, Tapken took up an assistant trainer role with Stoke City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1936 FA Cup Final", "response": ["They followed this in the fourth round with a 2\u20130 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. The match was played seven days after the death of King George V, with both teams wearing black armbands. The crowd of 60,000 stood to sing Abide with Me and God Save the King before the kickoff. In the fifth round they were drawn against Newcastle United, in a rematch of the 1932 final. Newcastle had already knocked out the current cup holders, Sheffield Wednesday, in an earlier round. On the day, the gates to St James' Park needed to be closed before the match started to keep additional spectators out, some 64,484 fans already being inside the ground. The match resulted in a 3\u20133 draw, Arsenal having gone a goal ahead each time, but Newcastle coming back and equalising. The reason being according to the report in The Times was because \"Whenever the lead was gained, the side concentrated entirely on defence.\" In the replay at home, Arsenal won the game 3\u20130. They had gone a goal up in the first half from a penalty scored by Bastin after the Newcastle centre half David Davidson handled the ball in the box. Newcastle were unlucky not to draw level, and only Eddie Hapgood clearing a shot off the line prevented the scoreline being equal once more. The second goal came during an advance by Arsenal, where the Newcastle goalkeeper, Norman Tapken, cleared the ball directly to Arsenal midfielder Pat Beasley, who shot the ball into the back of an empty net. The final goal was another penalty, caused when Bastin was brought down in the box, who then promptly took and scored the shot himself."]}]}}
