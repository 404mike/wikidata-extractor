Tizard recruited Hanbury Brown to work for what would become the Telecommunications Research Establishment on Chain Home in 1936, where he worked until 1942; after this he spent 3 years in Washington, D.C. to work with the Combined Research Group at the Naval Research Laboratory developing the Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar which he and John William Sutton Pringle originally invented. By 1947 a consultancy that had been set up by Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the father of radar, offered more interesting prospects for the conversion of wartime developments into peacetime technologies. Hanbury Brown was recruited and worked as a consulting engineer until Watson-Watt moved the firm to Canada. After considering his career possibilities, Hanbury Brown joined Bernard Lovell's radio astronomy group at the University of Manchester in 1949 to work on his PhD."]}, {"page": "Pringle", "response": ["** John William Sutton Pringle (1912\u20131982), British zoologist"]}, {"page": "Campaniform sensilla", "response": ["The activity of campaniform sensilla was first recorded by John William Sutton Pringle in the late 1930s. Pringle also determined that the oval shape of many sensilla makes them directionally selective \u2013 they respond best to compression along their short axis. Thus, even neighboring sensilla may have very different sensitivities to strain depending on their orientation in the cuticle. For example, stick insects possess two groups of campaniform sensilla on the dorsal side of their legs' trochanter whose short axes are oriented perpendicularly to one another (see inset in leg schematic). As a result, one group (G3) responds when the leg is bent upwards, whereas the other group (G4) responds when the leg is bent downwards. Round campaniform sensilla can be sensitive in all directions or show directional sensitivity if the cap is asymmetrically coupled with the surrounding collar."]}, {"page": "Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar", "response": ["The system was developed in the UK at the Telecommunications Research Establishment by Robert Hanbury Brown and John William Sutton Pringle. Rebecca was essentially an ASV radar fit to a new broadcaster unit, while the Eureka system was all-new. Initial production began in 1943, and the system was used for dropping supplies to resistance fighters in occupied Europe, after delivery of the portable Eureka unit. The US Army Air Force started production in the US as well, and both examples could be used interchangeably. Over time, the Rebecca/Eureka found a number of other uses, including blind-bombing, airfield approach, and as a blind-landing aid in the BABS (Beam Approach Beacon Signal) form."]}, {"page": "Linacre Professor of Zoology", "response": ["* 1961\u20131979 John William Sutton Pringle"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society P, Q, R", "response": ["| John William Sutton Pringle||18 March 1954||22 July 1912 \u2013 2 November 1982"]}, {"page": "John Pringle", "response": ["*John William Sutton Pringle (1912\u20131982), British zoologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1954", "response": ["*John William Sutton Pringle"]}, {"page": "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (P)", "response": ["|Sir John William Sutton Pringle", "|\"Sir John William Sutton Pringle\", KNAW Historisch Ledenbestand (Digitaal Wetenschapshistorisch Centrum).
