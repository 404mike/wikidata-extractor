Pember", "response": ["Pember also wrote very briefly about a Christian approach to animal welfare and animal rights, which was becoming a topic of great social concern in Victorian society.For historical background see Harold D. Guither, Animal Rights: History and Scope of a Radical Social Movement, Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1998.  What Pember had to say on the subject can be understood on a wide historical canvas. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries human attitudes about the status of animals began to change as theologians and philosophers discussed whether animals were capable of rational thought, had emotions, had a soul, and questions about brutal treatment were also debated.Keith Thomas, Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500\u20131800, London: Penguin, 1984.  Some theologians began to examine passages of the Bible concerned with the afterlife and the prophesied new heaven and new earth, and as those discussions developed Nathaniel Homes (1654) and Stephen Charnock (1660) argued that animals would be included in the resurrection of the dead.Nathaniel Homes, The Resurrection Revealed, or the Dawning of the Day-Star, London: Simpkin & Marshall, 1833 [1654]. Stephen Charnock, The Existence and Attributes of God, in The Complete Works of Stephen Charnock Vol 2. Edinburgh: James Nichol, 1864 [1660]. In the eighteenth century the debate was carried forward by both the Anglican Bishop Joseph Butler in his Analogy of Religion and the Anglican priest and hymn writer Augustus Montague Toplady, both believed in the resurrection of animals, while Toplady regarded brutality towards animals as sin.See Joseph Butler, The Analogy of Religion, Part 1, Chapter 1, reprint ed. London: George Bell, 1902 [1736]. Augustus Toplady, \"Whether Unnecessary Cruelty to the Brute Creation is Criminal\" in The Works of Augustus Toplady, reprint ed. London: J. Chidley, 1837 [1794], 443\u2013448. Other important contributors to the debate were Humphry Primatt (1776), Richard Dean (1767) and John Wesley as they each addressed the problem of brutality to animals in connection with the problem of evil and sin, while both Dean and Wesley held to the resurrection of animals.Humphry Primatt, A Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy and Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals, London: R. Hett, 1776. Richard Dean, An Essay on the Future Life of Brutes, 2 Vols. Manchester: J. Harrop, 1767. John Wesley, \"The Great Deliverance\" in The Works of the Rev.
