It was called the Little Missouri River Telegraph Station, and manned by soldiers of the 7th U.S. Cavalry. Then it was named Stoneville, after the local bartender Lou Stone. It served as a stagecoach stop between Deadwood and Miles City, Montana. It was the site of a gun battle in 1884 between local authorities and rustlers known as the Exelby gang. The town's name was changed from Stoneville in 1885, because of confusion with another similarly named community. The name \"Alzada\" came from an early settler named Laura Alzada Shelden.Aarstad, Rich, Ellie Arguimbau, Ellen Baumler, Charlene Porsild, and Brian Shovers. \"Montana Place Names from Alzada to Zortman\" .
