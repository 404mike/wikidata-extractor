All three goalkeepers picked up injuries, leaving manager Paul Jewell no choice but to play Southall at Valley Parade on 12 March 2000, against Leeds United. At the age of 41 years and 178 days he became the fourth oldest player in Premier League history. Leeds won 2\u20131, and Southall was criticised in the media for being too overweight to play professionally.

In his second season with Wednesday, he scored only seven goals and Booth was never to reach double figures in the Premiership again. Despite this, Booth had many highlights at Sheffield Wednesday including a hat-trick on his return to the team following an operation, against Bolton Wanderers. In a game against Liverpool in May 1997 Booth was required to go in goal after Kevin Pressman had gone off injured and his replacement, Matt Clarke, was sent off.

West Bromwich Albion dominated most of the match but it was not until a minute before half time that they took the lead with a goal from Jason Roberts who ran onto a Richard Sneekes pass and struck the ball past Matt Clarke in the Bolton goal.  Ten minutes into the second half, Colin Hendry brought Roberts down and conceded a penalty which was converted by Lee Hughes to make it 2\u20130 to West Bromwich Albion.  With less than ten minutes remaining, Gu\u00f0ni Bergsson scored with a header from Bo Hansen's corner to reduce the deficit.  In the 88th minute, West Bromwich Albion's Tony Butler fouled Hansen to concede a penalty which was converted by Per Frandsen, and the match ended 2\u20132. The return leg of the semi-final was played four days later at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton.  Bergsson opened the scoring for the home side after ten minutes, converting a free kick from Simon Charlton.  In the 63rd minute, Ricardo Gardner doubled Bolton's lead on the day with a goal after running on to a pass from Anthony Barness.
