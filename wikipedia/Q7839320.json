It was Seith's last match for the club; he read in the Burnley Express that he would not play against Nottingham Forest and was aggrieved at not being told directly by Potts. A dispute followed, after which he was put on the transfer list.Quelch (2015), p. 176 Adamson was moved to the centre-half position to partner Cummings, while Miller was placed in midfield.Simpson (2007), p. 293 This resulted in three consecutive wins: Forest and Leicester City were both defeated 1\u20130, while Burnley beat Luton 3\u20130 despite only having 10 men for most of the game. Connelly scored the winning goal against Leicester, his 20th league goal of the season, but picked up a cartilage injury during the match and was out for the remainder of the season; he was replaced by Trevor Meredith. On 18 April, Meredith scored his first goal in a 2\u20131 loss in the return game at Leicester, with former Burnley player Cheesebrough netting the winner for the home team.Quelch (2015), pp. 179\u2013181"]}, {"page": "History of Burnley F.C.", "response": ["In the 1955\u201356 season, Burnley reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, where they were knocked out by Chelsea after four replays. On his senior debut in 1957, 17-year-old Ian Lawson scored a club record four goals against Chesterfield in the FA Cup third round. In the next round, Burnley tied their largest  victory when they beat New Brighton by a scoreline of 9\u20130. The side reached the sixth round but were eliminated by Aston Villa after a replay.Simpson (2007), pp. 281\u2013284 In 1958, former Burnley player Harry Potts was appointed manager. His side mainly revolved around captain Jimmy Adamson and Jimmy McIlroy, the team's playmaker, while his squad consisted mostly of players who were recruited from the club's youth academy. Only two players, McIlroy and Alex Elder, cost a transfer fee, with both players bought from Northern Irish club Glentoran for \u00a38,000 (the equivalent of \u00a3 as of ) in 1950 and \u00a35,000 (the equivalent of \u00a3 as of ) in January 1959, respectively.Simpson (2007), p. 292 Potts often employed the then unfashionable 4\u20134\u20132 formation and implemented a playing style which later became known as Total Football. Jimmy Greaves labelled Burnley's style of play as \"smooth, skilled football that was a warming advertisement for all that was best about British football\". The side endured a tense 1959\u201360 season, in which Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers were the other contenders for the league title. Burnley won their second First Division championship on the last day with a 2\u20131 victory at Manchester City with goals from Brian Pilkington and Trevor Meredith. Although Burnley had been in contention all season, they had not led the table until the last match was played. The Daily Mirror noted: \"Burnley, the team of quiet men\u2014five of them are part-timers and the whole outfit cost less than \u00a315,000\u2014snatched the First Division Championship from the teeth of the famous Wolves\".Quelch (2015), p. 189 With 80,000 inhabitants, the town of Burnley became one of the smallest to have an English first-tier champion. After the season ended, the squad travelled to the United States to represent England in the International Soccer League, the first modern international American soccer tournament. Burnley defeated Bayern Munich (West Germany), Glenavon (Northern Ireland) and Nice (France) but finished runners-up in the group stage behind Scottish side Kilmarnock."]}]}}
