However, the arrival of Arthur Archer as first-choice right back meant Lester was in competition with Pratt for the left-back position, which restricted his appearances.

He was appointed captain, and contributed to their reaching the last 32 of the 1905\u201306 FA Cup, in which they lost to Football League First Division club Middlesbrough only after two replays; according to the Daily Mirror match report, Hulme played splendidly. By 1907 he was again primarily a reserve, standing in when Arthur Archer was unavailable. In recognition of his five years' service to the club, he became the first Albion player to be awarded a benefit match. The chosen match was the Western League fixture against Southampton, but the weather was extremely wet and the attendance was reported as \"barely two thousand\". He played only one first-team match in 1908\u201309, and retired at the end of the season, having scored 7 goals from 174 appearances for Albion in first-team competition. He then returned to his native Leek when he re-signed for Macclesfield. He later became trainer of local team Leek United, probably from the 1909\u201310 season as he only made two appearances for Macclesfield during that season having been almost ever-present during the 1908\u201309 season."]}]}}
