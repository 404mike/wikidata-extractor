It was initially built (or re-built) in 1818 at the western slope below the observatory hill (present location of Gorkha Rang Manch Bhavan). In 1835 Darjeeling was loaned to the British by the Raja of Sikkim to establish a sanatorium. After the British settled in Darjeeling they laid the foundation stone of the St. Andrew's Church in 1843 just above the Sangchen Thongdrol Ling (Ging) Gompa. The church was damaged in an earthquake and was re-built in 1873. It is believed that the British found the sound of the morning and evening rituals of the monastery annoying and hence decided to cause the monastery to shift to a new location with the excuse that the area would be developed into a secular public park. Hence, around 1879, Sangchen Thongdrol Ling Gompa was relocated to Gying, thus clearing the space and establishing the Victoria Pleasance Park (presently Gorkha Rang Manch Bhavan) in its place. This chain of events would seem to suggest that the original monastery on top of observatory hill, later destroyed by the invading Gurkha army, was rebuilt at the Gorkha Rang Manch Bhavan location in 1818 by the lamas of Pemayangtse and finally relocated to Ging in 1879 on being insisted by the British rulers. This hypothesis has also been suggested by Deki and Nicholas Rhodes in their book A Man of the Frontier: S. W. Laden La (1876-1936): His Life and Times in Darjeeling and Tibet. However, presently, as far as popular belief goes the Gompa originally built on the observatory hill is thought to be the Bhutia Busty Monastery (belonging to the Karma Kagyu Sect) which is also popularly famed as the oldest monastery in Darjeeling."]}, {"page": "Nick Rhodes (disambiguation)", "response": ["Nick or Nicholas Rhodes may also refer to:", "*Nicholas Rhodes (1946\u20132011), British numismatist"]}, {"page": "Rhodes, Nicholas", "response": ["#redirectNicholas Rhodes"]}]}}
