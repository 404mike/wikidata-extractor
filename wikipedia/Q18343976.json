A trained mechanical engineer, Lauder was responsible for many of the technical advancements made in the steel industry during the Industrial Revolution including updates to both the Bessemer Process and coal washing machinery while also leading the use of steel in arms and defense.\nLauder was the \"cousin-brother\", and business partner of, steel magnate Andrew Carnegie in the Carnegie Steel Company. The two were among the richest people in the world during their lifetimes with Lauders fortune valued at roughly $19 billion (in 2018 dollars). The sale of Carnegie Steel to J.P. Morgan in 1901 created U.S. Steel where Lauder sat on the board of directors. This became the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion ($43.6 billion today).", "link_mentions": {}}}
