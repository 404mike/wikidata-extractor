It was produced by Jazze Pha, set in a party to honor the Notorious B.I.G. It was shot in the black themed apartment of Cindy Gallop. It includes clips of Smalls in the beginning and end of the video (the first showing Biggie and Tupac Shakur as friends before the rivalry). Just before Nelly's verse, Naomi Campbell makes a memorable entrance into the video, slapping a man in the process, when the man asks \"Aren't you one of those Top Model girls?\" The man is thought to represent Damon Dash because he's wearing a cap with the State Property logo on it. Dash was part owner of the State Property brand, and was frequently seen wearing caps with the logo. This episode may have been in retaliation for the movie Death of a Dynasty, which was produced and directed by Dash, and in which Diddy was portrayed in a farcical manner."]}, {"page": "Sexual Freedom Awards", "response": ["*Pioneer - Cindy Gallop"]}, {"page": "MakeLoveNotPorn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cindy Gallop"]}, {"page": "So God Made a Farmer", "response": ["The ad received mostly positive reviews. Slate called it the \"most striking Super Bowl ad\" but also criticized it for being similar in concept to a 2011 YouTube video by Farms.com.  While the Slate review was criticizing its originality, Farms.com released a statement reflecting their approval of the ad.  While liveblogging the Super Bowl commercials for the Wall Street Journal, Cindy Gallop referred to it as the \"Great American Super Bowl Commercial\".  Dale Buss, of Forbes, wrote \"Chrysler managed to insert just enough of its vehicles and brands in each spot so as to make their inclusion seem part of the fabric of the paean, not at all intrusive, thereby lending the kind of authenticity to Ram and Jeep that fuels long-term brand success\".  The ad ranked third in the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter. Critics noted that the ad focused on the family farm despite the industrialization of agriculture in America.

Use of the term was propagated online by Cindy Gallop from MLNP and is associated with an advancement of the Digital Revolution from 2010 and its impact on society and culture. It is often used in conjunction or interchangeably with the term 'teledildonics' referring to the remote connection between Bluetooth enabled sex toys that use haptic feedback to reciprocate or mimic human, sexual interaction. However, teledildonics is far more representative of Bluetooth-enabled sex toys and captures the technological capacities of its time whereas sex-technology is rooted in more modern discourse. As such, the word sex-tech is an umbrella term used to describe multiple technologies spanning from VR porn, health and sexual wellness platform or app-based technology, Bluetooth enabled sex toys, pornography video scripting, remote sex interfaces and sex robots.", "While still nascent, sextech has seen a recent boom in mainstream acceptance due to a big push from female-led firms in the space.
