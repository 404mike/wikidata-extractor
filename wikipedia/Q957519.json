The route between Lake Superior and Red River connected trading posts and was used by the Hudson's Bay Company for some travel. The route had been used frequently by the company using canoe for trading fur before 1821. While the pass had not been originally part of the expedition, John Ball wanted a neutral perspective of the company's route and determine if it could be used by travelers and for transporting goods as a connecting route between the west and the rest of Canada. Palliser and his party also examined a route called White Fish River to see where the Kaministikwia River connected to the main river and determine if it could be used for transportation purposes or as another possible pass from Canada to the prairies. Palliser had seen waterways being used for transportation in Mississippi and Missouri and saw the potential for connecting Red River to the rest of Canada.", "While some explorers had travelled from Red River out west, many followed routes along the Saskatchewan River that had been used by fur traders. Palliser became more aware of other routes that existed, primarily used by Indigenous communities. In 1848, Palliser met James Sinclair, a Metis explorer with the Hudson's Bay Company, who told Palliser about another pass which was off the route from Red River to the Rocky Mountains and along the border. In 1856, Palliser's interest in the western prairies initiated his plan to explore Western Canada along the American border on an expedition. His interest in some of these alternative routes became an idea for a project that could be used to survey the land and provide information about this region. His project was proposed to the Royal Geographical Society which was involved in coordinating expeditions and worked with the government to help fund some of them, after he was elected as a member of the society on November 24, 1856. Through the Royal Geographical Society, the Expedition Committee approved Palliser's proposal, but recommended that the expedition include the help of scientists who were able to conduct scientific research that could be used to better understand the land as Palliser did not have any formal training. Under the recommendation of John Ball who was the parliamentary under-secretary of state for the colonies during 1856, the government provided funding towards the expedition of \u00a35,000. With the British government's interest in the region that Palliser was proposing to explore, they accepted the proposal and provided funding and support for the expedition.
