After a further three years under McBain between 1956 and 1959, Watford's following three managers presided over improved teams. Ron Burgess led Watford to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1959\u201360. Bill McGarry was only in charge for one full season (1963\u201364), but Watford recorded a finish of third in the Third Division, the club's highest Football League finish until that point. His successor Ken Furphy matched that achievement in 1966\u201367, and led Watford to the Third Division title in 1969, before taking the club to its first FA Cup semi-final in 1970. Following Furphy's departure in 1971, Watford entered a period of decline, experiencing relegation under subsequent managers George Kirby and Mike Keen."]}, {"page": "\u00cd\u00fer\u00f3ttabandalag Akraness", "response": ["* George Kirby (1974\u201375)", "* George Kirby (1977\u201378)", "* George Kirby (1980)", "* George Kirby (1982)", "* George Kirby (1990)"]}, {"page": "2000 in association football", "response": ["* March 24 - George Kirby (66), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 in English football", "response": ["11 December 1965: Victory for Liverpool over Arsenal sees the Kopites open up a three-point gap over Burnley in second at the top of the Football League, while West Bromwich Albion \u2013 formerly in third \u2013 slide down the table after Leeds United hit them for four.
