Samuel Stephens, defeated by 7 votes, accused William Praed and Adam Drummond (the Duke of Bolton's candidate) of benefiting from several types of corruption. Humphrey Mackworth Praed, William's father, was said to have lent large sums to voters on the understanding that repayment would not be demanded if they voted for Praed and Drummond; but opposing counsel adduced evidence that Stephens had also resorted to bribery. However, it was alleged that many of Stephens' supporters had been prevented from voting, by rating them as not liable for scot and lot and so not eligible to vote; this disenfranchisement was a frequent abuse in such boroughs.  His side, as petitioners, failed to bring any evidence of criminal misconduct by the parish overseers so the committee decided they had no jurisdiction to interfere. In the end, the committee upheld Drummond's election and declared that neither Stephens nor Praed had been properly elected, thus a writ was issued for a by-election to fill the second seat.", "The cost of electioneering in St Ives seems eventually to have led to Buckinghamshire and Bolton withdrawing, and by 1784 Praed was considered unchallenged as patron. Nevertheless, Stephens' influence was not extinguished, and it was recorded that the patrons at the time of the Reform Act were Samuel Stephens of Tregarron and Sir Christopher Hawkins of Trewithan (who had purchased the manor of Mr Praed).", "| Samuel Stephens", "|rowspan=\"2\"| Samuel Stephens", "| Samuel Stephens"]}, {"page": "Samuel Stephens", "response": ["Samuel Stephens may refer to:", "*Samuel Stephens (senior) (1728\u20131794), Member of Parliament for St Ives 1751\u20131754", "*Samuel Stephens (junior) (c.1768\u20131834), Member of Parliament for St Ives 1806\u20131812 and 1818\u20131820, son of the above", "*Samuel Stephens (Colonial Manager) (1808\u20131840), first Colonial Manager (CEO) of the South Australian Company (1836\u20131837)", "*Samuel Stephens (New Zealand) (1803\u20131855), member of the New Zealand House of Representatives", "*Samuel Stephens (North Carolina governor) (1629-1669), Colonial Governor of North Carolina"]}, {"page": "Samuel Stephens (senior)", "response": ["Samuel Stephens (died 1794) was a politician and MP for St. Ives between 1752 and 1754.
