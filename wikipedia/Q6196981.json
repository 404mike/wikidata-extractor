A former manager of East Fife, Moffat's first game in charge was a 9\u20131 defeat to Greenock Morton on 7 April 2007, which saw Forfar relegated to the Third Division. The following season did not go well, and Moffat was sacked on 21 April 2008, with Forfar going on to finish bottom of the Third Division. Dick Campbell became Forfar's new manager on 8 May 2008.", "Dick Campbell became Forfar's manager on 8 May 2008 on a two-year deal, after Jim Moffat failed to improve the team's fortunes. Campbell's first season in charge of Forfar was full of highs and lows. The start of the season was a mixed affair with Forfar being unbeaten away from home but found lacking when playing at Station Park. With a dreadful winter and numerous games called off the months of March and April were for catch up and Dick was very close to leading the team into the play-offs for the Irn-Bru Second Division. During his first season at Station Park Dick cut the wage bill and due to good cup success took Forfar Athletic out of the red and into the black. On 13 December 2009 Campbell became embroiled in controversy regarding sectarian singing. On 16 May 2010 Dick and Ian Campbell got Forfar promoted to the second division through the play offs with a 2\u20130 victory against local rivals Arbroath. On 14 May 2011, Forfar failed to reach the play-off final for First Division status, losing out to Ayr United, by an aggregate score of 7\u20134. The team also qualified for the play-offs at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. In the first leg against Dunfermline Athletic, they scored three times in the first half, eventually winning 3\u20131. In the second leg, however, poor discipline led to three of their players being sent off. Despite taking an early lead, they lost the match 3\u20131. In extra time, the eight men struggled against their full-time opponents, and Dunfermline eventually won 6\u20131, to go through 7\u20134 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "East Fife F.C.", "response": ["* Jim Moffat (2002\u20132006)"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 in Scottish football", "response": ["| Forfar Athletic ||  Jim Moffat || Mutual consent || 21 April ||  Dick Campbell || 8 May"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Scottish Third Division", "response": ["| Forfar Athletic ||  Jim Moffat || Mutual consent || 21 April ||  Dick Campbell || 8 May"]}, {"page": "James Moffat", "response": ["*Jim Moffat (born 1960), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
