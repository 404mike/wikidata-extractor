An injury to Jack Hobbs gave him his chance to play regularly, and he scored over 1,000 runs in his first full season. His career was almost ended over a challenge to his qualification to play for Surrey in 1922. Outside of cricket, Jeacocke worked in the family business at Smithfield Market.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Percy Fender", "response": ["Fender completed the double in 1922 with 1,169 runs and 157 wickets, Surrey finished third in the Championship, and once again the lack of effective bowling hindered the team. Wisden described the team's success as \"nothing less than a triumph for Mr Fender\". Despite damp weather which did not suit his style, he bowled more than his share of overs, often because there were few alternative bowlers. Wisden said: \"Essentially a change bowler [one who bowls while the main bowlers are rested]\u2014the best in England, as he has been aptly described\u2014he became by force of circumstances the chief attacking force\". He bowled mainly leg spin, but often bowled successfully at medium pace.Streeton, p. 124. Wisden praised his inspirational captaincy, and concluded: \"Over and above all this he was, by general consent, by far the best of the county captains, never losing his grip of the game and managing his side with a judgement that was seldom at fault.\" During the season, Fender began to wear glasses in an attempt to cure headaches; the remedy worked, although he later discovered there was nothing wrong with his eyesight, and the lenses he wore were little more than plain glass. The first time he wore glasses, Fender scored 185 in 130 minutes against Hampshire. Other rapid scoring feats included 91 in 50 minutes against Leicestershire and 137 in 90 minutes against Kent.Streeton, p. 122. There were no Tests in 1922, but Sydney Pardon wrote that Fender was the only amateur who could be guaranteed a place on ability alone in an England team. Late in the season, Fender was involved in a public dispute with Lord Harris over the qualification of Alfred Jeacocke to play for Surrey. Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent,  had noticed that Jeacocke's qualification had lapsed when he moved across the border from Surrey to Kent, albeit living on the same road. Fender, privately furious with Harris, publicly defended Jeacocke, and the press supported him; the rules were altered the following season to allow Jeacocke to continue to play for Surrey.Streeton, pp. 125\u201326."]}, {"page": "Arthur Pothecary", "response": ["Pothecary represented Hampshire in 268 first-class matches from 1927 until the Second World War and played a further three for the county after the war in 1946, with his final appearance for the county coming in 1946 against Sussex at Dean Park Cricket Ground, Bournemouth. In his 271 matches for the county, Pothecary scored 9,447 runs at a batting average of 23.34, with 47 half centuries, 9 centuries and a high score of 130 against the touring New Zealanders in 1937. Pothecary scored over 1,000 runs in a season on four occasions: 1933, 1936, 1937 and 1938. With the ball Pothecary took 52 wickets at a bowling average of 41.14, with best figures of 4/47 which came on debut against Surrey; Pothecary's wickets included Jack Hobbs, Andy Sandham, Alfred Jeacocke and Tom Shepherd. In the field Pothecary took 147 catches for Hampshire, fielding mostly at cover point."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Alfred Jeacocke (1921\u20131933)"]}, {"page": "Jeacocke", "response": ["* Alfred Jeacocke (1892\u20131961), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Alfred Jeacocke (1930\u20131933) : A.

He was educated at Haileybury, before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He graduated from Sandhurst in December 1919, entering as a second lieutenant into the Middlesex Regiment. He was seconded for service with the Royal Air Force in November 1922, by which point he held the rank of lieutenant. He relinquished the rank of flying officer when he returned to duty with the Middlesex Regiment in November 1926. He made a single appearance in first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's in 1930. Playing as a right-arm fast bowler, he took the wickets of Alfred Jeacocke, Tom Jameson and Bill Bowes in the MCC first-innings with figures of 3 for 55, while in their second-innings he took the wicket of Sid Pegler, taking figures of 1 for 31. With the bat, he was dismissed in the Army first-innings by Bowes for 7 runs, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by the same bowler without scoring. In the same year he was seconded as a supervising officer for physical training with the Eastern Command, a role he held until October 1933. He played minor counties cricket for Hertfordshire in 1933 and 1934, making nine appearances in the Minor Counties Championship. "]}]}}
