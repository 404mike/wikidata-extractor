Livingstone described Shah's postings, which were made before she became an MP at the 2015 general election, as \"rude and over-the-top\" but not antisemitic, adding that he had never encountered antisemitism in Labour. Livingstone defended his claim about Hitler and Zionism by reference to Lenni Brenner's Zionism in the Age of the Dictators, and many commentators suggested that Livingstone was referring to the Haavara Agreement between Nazi Germany and the Zionist Federation of Germany. Livingstone's statements were criticised as ahistorical by historians, including Timothy D.
