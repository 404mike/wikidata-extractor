She has sometimes been attributed as the founder of roundarm bowling but it is known that the style was originated by Tom Walker. Many cricket sources name her as Christina rather than Christiana, but John Major and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography are adamant that Christiana was the correct spelling of her name.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roundarm bowling", "response": ["The idea of roundarm is sometimes attributed to Christiana Willes, sister of Kent cricketer John Willes. The story goes that when bowling to her brother in the garden at home in the 1800s,  Willes found herself inconvenienced by her large, lead-weighted dress which prevented her from performing the underarm action. Elevating the arm to just above waist height, she bowled without interference from her attire. According to John Major in More Than A Game, the story is unlikely to be true for reasons of fashion more than cricket because hooped skirts were out of fashion during the period of the Napoleonic War."]}, {"page": "Hodges (surname)", "response": ["* Christiana Hodges, married name of Christiana Willes (1786\u20131873), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Willes", "response": ["*Christiana Willes (1786-1873), English cricketer and sister of John"]}, {"page": "Christina Willes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christiana Willes"]}, {"page": "Christiana Hodges", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christiana Willes "]}]}}
