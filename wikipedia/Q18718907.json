The song was recorded at EMI Recording Studios, Abbey Road with a nine piece band under the direction of Martin Slavin. After Helen's appearance on the ITV musical programme Thank Your Lucky Stars, the record took off and reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1961. According to AllMusic, Shapiro's rich and mature choice made her \"an extraordinary new phenomenon on the British pop scene.\" Her next single, the ballad \"You Don't Know\", topped the chart in August. The follow-up, \"Walkin' Back to Happiness\", was written written by John Schroeder and Mike Hawker and featured backing orchestrations by Norrie Paramor. The single quickly scaled the top of the chart with far greater sales than her last in October 1961, by which time Shapiro had turned 15. She had initially been reticent to record the song as she considered it old-fashioned and corny. Both of Shapiro's No. 1 singles sold over a million copies, earning her two gold discs. Her mature voice made her an overnight sensation, as well as the youngest female chart topper in the UK."]}, {"page": "Fool Around", "response": ["# \"Stay Awhile\" (Mike Hawker, Ivor Raymonde) \u2013 3:03"]}, {"page": "The Vernons Girls", "response": ["*Jean Ryder - a member of the group from 1958 to 1962, Ryder later married the songwriter Mike Hawker.

Three remakes of the song have been UK chart hits, the first two by the Bay City Rollers (1976) and The Tourists (1979) matching the number 4 peak of the Dusty Springfield original, while the 1989 remake by Samantha Fox peaked at number 16.

Ryder, who would later be a member of the Breakaways, had been a member of a vocal chorale, the Vernons Girls. Reportedly, she and Hawker had intended that she herself would record \"I Only Want to Be With You\". However, no formal arrangement for this eventuality had apparently been made by the autumn of 1963, when Hawker received a phone call from Philips A&R director Johnny Franz. Ryder paraphrases Franz as saying \"Look we need something which is going to put this girl into the charts, because everybody is knocking her, everybody is saying she'll never make it [solo] \u2013 have you got a song that's a guaranteed hit?\" Springfield had already recorded nine solo tracks, none of which was deemed the right vehicle to launch her solo career. With Ryder's permission, Hawker submitted \"I Only Want to Be With You\" to Franz, having made a demo featuring Ryder singing while keeping the beat by tapping on a biscuit tin lid. Franz, and then Springfield, approved the song, which Springfield recorded in a 25 October 1963 session at Olympic Studios, arranged and conducted by Ivor Raymonde, and recorded by engineer Keith Grant. Jean Ryder was included in the vocal chorale on the session. For unknown reasons, a version with Springfield's unadulterated vocals was rejected. The song was produced using the Wall of Sound production method first conceived by Phil Spector, while the various instrumental features in the arrangement such as backup singers, double-tracked vocals, and a horn section were inspired by groups such as the Shirelles.", "Category:Songs written by Mike Hawker (songwriter)"]}, {"page": "Eres t\u00fa", "response": ["This song also has an English version titled \"Touch the Wind\" with lyrics by Mike Hawker."]}, {"page": "You Don't Know (Helen Shapiro song)", "response": ["\"You Don't Know \" is a 1961 single by Helen Shapiro.
