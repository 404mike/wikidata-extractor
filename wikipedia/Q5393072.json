In August 1891, Barrington and Jessie Bond took a leave of absence from that show to tour a series of \"musical duologues\" (written by Barrington and composed by Solomon) throughout Britain, returning to the Savoy in November. In 1892, Barrington played the title role of the Reverend William Barlow, in Grundy and Solomon's The Vicar of Bray and then toured with that show.Barrington (1908), p. 88 In September 1892, he created the role of Rupert Vernon in Grundy and Sullivan's Haddon Hall, making a critical splash.  For example, The Figaro wrote: \"Barrington... kept the audience in shouts of laughter the whole time [he was] on the stage.\" In 1893, he created the role of the Proctor in J. M. Barrie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Ernest Ford's Jane Annie, which was unsuccessful at the Savoy but ran more successfully on tour.  Barrington, a lifelong golf enthusiast, speculated that one reason for the failure of Jane Annie in London was that the game of golf was not yet popular there.Barrington (1908), p. 96 Despite the failure of the piece, Barrington was singled out for critical praise.Walters, p. 19 Barrington next created the role of King Paramount I in Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited, opening in October of that year.

He then created the role of Bobinet in Mirette (1894).  Bobinet was Passmore's first real starring part.  In the autumn of 1894, Passmore named his new daughter \"Mirette\", perhaps in acknowledgement of his success in this break-out role.
