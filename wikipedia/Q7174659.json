A one-time pupil of Sir Anthony Caro, Hide is best known for upright, large-scale welded sculptures made of heavy, rusted industrial scrap steel.Peter Hide works in the Modernist assembled sculpture tradition begun by Pablo Picasso and continued by David Smith and Anthony Caro, but with an emphasis on weight and pressure unlike his artistic forebears. Like his mentor Caro, Hide's sculptures forsake the plinth, but against Caro's open weightlessness, Hide reclaims mass and the monolith, connecting his work to inspirational sources in Auguste Rodin and Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i. \"I think a lot of sculptors,\" Hide says, \"especially those who were taught by Tony Caro, decided deliberately to move as far away as possible so as not to be seen as his disciples. The problem is that if you do that you move away from extremely fertile territory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anthony Caro", "response": ["Caro was also a tutor at Saint Martin's School of Art in London, inspiring a younger generation of British abstract sculptors, led by former students and assistants including Phillip King, Tim Scott, William G.

This formal education ironically left Willms feeling \"disillusioned with the arts completely\". Willms married, and had two children. A visit to the steel sculpture studio of Peter Hide reignited Willms' interest in art. Hide took Willms on, initially as an exhibition preparation volunteer, then as a studio assistant, and eventually as a Master of Fine Arts student at the University of Alberta. During his time at the school, Willms co-founded the Society of Student Artists (SoSA), now known as the University of Alberta Visual Arts Student Association (VASA). After leaving university, Willms joined the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop (NESW). Willms is a member of the Edmonton Contemporary Artists' Society (ECAS).", "Willms works in the Modernist assembled sculpture tradition begun by Julio Gonz\u00e1lez and Pablo Picasso, and continued by David Smith, Anthony Caro, and Willms' mentor, Peter Hide, using solid and sheet steel forms to create heavy, convoluted abstract sculptures. Art critic Piri Halasz has written, in reference to international contemporary sculpture, \"As far as that goes, New York also has no equal to Hide, nor to such up-and-comers as Willms...\". Robert Willms himself has stated, \"No declaration regarding my artwork will withstand scrutiny when compared against the work itself, and little that I say about myself can be surely trusted. Words lack. I am unable to adequately explain how it is that one sculpture looks better than another. Neither can I foretell how good the next one might be. I nevertheless aspire, beholden by the greatest examples of art, to the creation of my own good work \u2013 a life\u2019s work that will last because it\u2019s too good to toss out.\" Six of Willms' sculptures are featured in the Robert T. Webb Sculpture Garden; the largest representation of works by any one artist within the collection. Trojan Taurus is listed in the \"key works\" within the \"Founders Garden\" area of the collection.
