Based in London, she has released a number of singles and 3 EPs. The Guardian has described her sound as veering \"between PC Music, bubblegum pop, pop punk and rap, each one treading a line between catchy and deliberately discomforting.\" Much of her music is about feminism, sexuality, queer culture, and mental health. In April 2019, Girli released her debut studio album, Odd One Out, on PMR Records. After being dropped by her record label and later being forced to cancel her 2020 Sofa Tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Girli announced her comeback in 2021 with the release of new EP, Ex Talk. She is currently with independent label AllPoints.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of hip hop musicians", "response": ["* Girli"]}, {"page": "Shungudzo", "response": ["| Girli"]}, {"page": "LeeFest", "response": ["After taking a year out, LeeFest was back for its 10th anniversary, rebranded as LeeFest presents: The Neverland.

Speaking to The Courier (Newcastle University newspaper) Nick Donnelly said 'The idea for Generation Worldwide was reactionary... It was one of these ideas so crazy it might just work, but so crazy you would never even dream of writing it down in plan... Knowing that the music industry was broken this year, and knowing that on average only 19% of performers at festivals are women, we took this opportunity to create a new experience.'"]}, {"page": "King Henry (producer)", "response": ["| Girli || \"Not That Girl\" || Feel OK EP"]}, {"page": "List of songs written by Charli XCX", "response": ["Some artists applauded Charli XCX for her songwriting skills, including Olivia Rodrigo, Izzy Camina, Girli, and Lolo Zoua\u00ef.
