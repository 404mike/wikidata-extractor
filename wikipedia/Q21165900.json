T .N. Williamson; 15 February 1923 \u2013 10 May 1992) was an English electronics engineer, most notable for a design of early high fidelity valve amplifier known as the Williamson amplifier, that originally featured \"OSRAM\" brand valves (such as KT66 \"Kinkless\" Tetrode and L63 triode) made by the M. O. Valve Company, for which he had worked until 1946. The design was published in a series of articles in the influential British Wireless World magazine, beginning in May 1947. He continued his interest in hi-fi and writing for Wireless World after his move to Ferranti, and became Group Director of Engineering with Rank Xerox in 1974 before retiring in 1976. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (F.R.S.) in 1968.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "D T N Williamson", "response": ["#redirect David Theodore Nelson Williamson"]}, {"page": "David Williamson (disambiguation)", "response": ["* David Theodore Nelson Williamson (1923\u20131992), British electronics engineer"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society W, X, Y, Z", "response": ["|David Theodore Nelson Williamson||21/03/1968||15 February 1923 \u2013 10 May 1992 Electronic Engineer"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1968", "response": ["#David Theodore Nelson Williamson"]}]}}
