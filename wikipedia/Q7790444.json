W. Barker led the parish council to extensively  redevelop the church, to (in Barker's words) \"bring it more into harmony with the arrangements and decorations suited to the religious demands of the present day\". The new plans, by Thomas Harris (architect and churchwarden of the parish), removed the end wall and the upper galleries along the sides of the church (uncovering the windows' full length and letting in more light), created a chancel for a robed choir (with new carved mahogany choir stalls with angel ends) and a sanctuary within the new apse, and added a marble mosaic floor, a fine marble pulpit and two balustrades (with Alpha and Omega on the latter). This new scheme combined Neo-Classicism with Pre-Raphaelitism, and included a gilded cross in the ceiling above the site of the original altar. Funded by subscription, it began in 1884 (with a memorial stone, laid by Mrs Gladstone, wife of the Prime Minister, in the outside wall of the apse) and was completed a year later."]}, {"page": "Stokesay Court", "response": ["Stokesay Court was built for John Derby Allcroft. His architect was Thomas Harris. Allcroft had made his fortune as a glover, his father having entered a successful partner with Dents that saw the company led by Allcroft, and renamed Dent, Allcroft & Co., become the biggest manufacturer in the world. Allcroft was also a philanthropist, Christian evangelist and church-builder, and member of parliament. He funded the construction of churches including St Matthew's, Bayswater, St Jude's Church, Kensington (now St Mellitus College), and St Martin's, Gospel Oak and served as Treasurer and major benefactor to Christ's Hospital school. He purchased the estate, including Stokesay Castle, which he felt unsuitable as a residence, and an existing small house, which did not meet the needs of his expanding family, in 1868; adding to his landholdings in 1874 by the purchase of adjacent land, which he chose as the site for his mansion.
