City won 1\u20130, with Torrance being considered the 'Man of the Match'.Torrance became more involved in first team games, playing 23 league games the following season and all seven games during City's FA Cup defence, and more than 30 in the three seasons before league football was suspended for the First World War. His last game for City was a wartime regional game against Barnsley in March 1917.Torrance, along with City's FA Cup winning captain Jimmy Speirs, was one of the club's players to die during service in the First World War whilst a gunner with the Royal Field Artillery.

After 15\u00a0minutes, Speirs scored what turned out to be the only goal of the game to win the cup. Robinson shot at goal, but the wind caught the ball, which was headed on by Frank Thompson. Speirs himself headed the ball at goal, and Newcastle's goalkeeper Jimmy Lawrence was distracted by City striker Frank O'Rourke and the ball rolled into the net. Speirs lifted the newly-cast trophy, which had been made by Bradford jewellers Fattorinis, and displayed it on the club's victory parade later that evening in Bradford.
