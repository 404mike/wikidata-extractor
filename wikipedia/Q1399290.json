England began the campaign well with a 3\u20130 victory over Czechoslovakia at Wembley, Mick Channon and Colin Bell scoring the goals. However a 0\u20130 home draw with Portugal was a minor setback, despite Malcolm Macdonald scoring all the goals in a 5\u20130 win over Cyprus following a morale boosting 2\u20130 friendly win over 1974 FIFA World Cup champions West Germany. Kevin Keegan scored the only goal of the game at the Tsirion Stadium to secure maximum points in Cyprus, and leave England in a strong position going into the two tough final group games in Czechoslovakia and Portugal. Though only drawing with Wales and Northern Ireland, a 5\u20131 victory over Scotland secured England the 1974\u201375 British Home Championship title and left England in confident mood for the crucial qualifying games. However, despite Channon opening the scoring they fell to a 2\u20131 defeat to the Czechoslovakians in Bratislava after playing with what was for Revie uncharacteristic attacking tactics. A 1\u20131 draw in Lisbon then allowed Czechoslovakia to clinch the group with a win over Cyprus. Czechoslovakia then went on to win the whole tournament. Revie was criticised for his constant changing of players during the qualifying group, particularly his decision to drop captains Emlyn Hughes and Alan Ball from his squad entirely, his mistrust of flair players like Charlie George and Alan Hudson, and his willingness to play players out of position."]}, {"page": "Colin Bell", "response": ["Bell also played for England in the 1973\u201374 British Home Championship which was shared with Scotland.
