There is no doubt that his selection created divisions in the Liberal ranks. Some compared the extent of the divisions with the position in 1886 when David Davies had defected to the Liberal Unionists. Nevertheless, a closer examination of the way delegates from individual wards voted at the selection conference indicates that both candidates drew support from rural wards and while the nineteen delegates from Aberystwyth voted for Phillips the eleven delegates from the county town of Cardigan supported Davies."]}, {"page": "1922 in Wales", "response": ["*The Gregynog Press is established by the sisters Margaret and Gwendoline Davies (granddaughters of Victorian industrialist David Davies) of Gregynog Hall."]}, {"page": "1915 in Wales", "response": ["*16 January - David Davies, 2nd Baron Davies of Llandinam (died 1944)"]}, {"page": "George M.

At 24 he became secretary of a Liverpool bank; when his health demanded a temporary rest, he was sent with a large salary to a manager's post in Wrexham in 1908. He later sought a complete change and took up agricultural work, then in 1913 went on to be secretary of a housing scheme, the Welsh Planning and Housing Trust.

This proposal won favour with the fledgling company, but it was not taken up.

He proposed forming a new company to revive the Mawddwy Railway as a light railway. In 1910 a Light Railway Order was granted, permitting the railway company to construct a \"new\" light railway on the disused trackbed. Davies negotiated an agreement with the Cambrian Railways that would keep the railway in the nominal control of the Mawddwy Railway company, but the Cambrian would fund the rebuilding of the railway, run all services, and keep the majority of the revenue.", "Reconstruction commenced immediately under the direction of G.C. MacDonald, the Engineer of the Cambrian Railways. The track was relaid in heavy rail and several bridges were rebuilt or strengthened. On 29 July 1911 the railway reopened under the chairmanship of David Davies, with trains operated by Cambrian Railways. The rolling stock of the old Mawddwy Railway was either scrapped, or repaired for use elsewhere on the Cambrian system; the railway was operated by Cambrian Railways stock.Cozens 2004, pages 23\u201335"]}, {"page": "Pembroke and Tenby Railway", "response": ["It seemed likely that the company's plans were in vain, but the dynamic contracting partnership of David Davies and Ezra Roberts entered into discussions with the directors and on 4 July 1862 they committed to build the line and provide rolling stock for \u00a3106,000.
