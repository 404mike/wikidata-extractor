Lacy Sweet: \"Lacy Sweet, to whom I have already referred, was another fine player. His style was a commanding one, and his game was marked by all-round excellence. Possessed of a powerful and accurate overhand service, a severe ground-stroke, formidable volleying and smashing powers, and great activity, he ought to have reached the very top of the tree. But from one cause or another he was never able to give that serious and unremitting attention to the game which successful tournament play exacts from its votaries. Consequently his performances, good though many of them were, never quite equalled the promise held out. He was very successful in Doubles with Ernest Renshaw. His death in 1892 was as unexpected as it was deeply regretted. For a more popular man the lawn tennis world did not possess\".Lacy Sweet played in the Wimbledon singles three times.  In 1887, Sweet reached the semifinals before handing Ernest Renshaw a walkover into the all comer's final. In 1888 Sweet lost his opening match to Herbert Wilberforce.  In 1890 he lost in the opening round to David Chaytor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gloucestershire Cup", "response": ["The Gloucestershire cup was created by Charles Lacy Sweet of Clifton Association F.C. after a meeting in September 1887.

Innes-Pocock from Clifton Association and representatives from Warmley, St George, St Agnes, and Southville voted to establish the Gloucestershire County Football Association.
