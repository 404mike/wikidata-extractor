His work with Frank Ludlam on the supercell thunderstorm at Wokingham, UK in 1962 was the first detailed study of such a storm. His well regarded research covered many areas of mesoscale meteorology including developing the theory of the sting jet. Arguably his greatest talent is his intuitive understanding of complex three-dimensional meteorological processes which he has described more simply using conceptual models.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1978. He was president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1988 to 1990.\nIn 1992, Browning was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for fundamental contributions to the detection and understanding of storms, and the development of operational storm-detection and warning systems.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timeline of meteorology", "response": ["* 1962 \u2013 Keith Browning and Frank Ludlam publish first detailed study of a supercell storm (over Wokingham, UK).

The first storm to be identified as the supercell type was the Wokingham storm over England, which was studied by Keith Browning and Frank Ludlam in 1962. Browning did the initial work that was followed up by Lemon and Doswell to develop the modern conceptual model of the supercell. To the extent that records are available, supercells are most frequent in the Great Plains of the central United States and southern Canada extending into the southeastern U.S. and northern Mexico; east-central Argentina and adjacent regions of Uruguay; Bangladesh and parts of eastern India; South Africa; and eastern Australia. Supercells occur occasionally in many other mid-latitude regions, including Eastern China and throughout Europe. The areas with highest frequencies of supercells are similar to those with the most occurrences of tornadoes; see tornado climatology and Tornado Alley."]}, {"page": "List of meteorologists", "response": ["*Keith Browning"]}, {"page": "Great storm of 1987", "response": ["Following the storm meteorologists at the University of Reading led by Professor Keith Browning developed the Sting jet concept.
