The band comprised Susman, Gaze, Mia Clarke, and Ros Murray. Their music drew from a wide range of influences including Neu!, Stereolab, Sonic Youth, and the Velvet Underground. Although the band had strong feminist and political views in their personal lives, they generally preferred to not communicate that directly to their fans or through their music; one exception is their inclusion of the protest song \"The Partisan,\" which they began playing while on tour in the United States during the months preceding the 2004 Presidential election. The band, when playing live, had a reputation for a focused show that minimised audience interaction and rarely included more than one encore.", "The band recorded their first single, \"Film Music,\" and released it in January 2000 on the Skint Records offshoot label Indenial. They released another single (\"Le Song\") with Fierce Panda before creating their own label, Let's Rock!, with distribution by 3MV. The first two singles they released were \"Gabriel\" and \"Blue Straggler\" and in fall of 2000 they began work on their debut album. During this period, they had a number of personnel changes. The original bassist was Tracy Houdek, who left the band due to a pregnancy. She was briefly replaced by Rupert Noble until Rachel Dalley signed on. Original guitarist Debbie Ball was replaced by Mia Clarke.", "* Mia Clarke \u2013 guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Title TK", "response": ["On \"London Song\", Jim Abbott at The Orlando Sentinel said the syncopated guitar performance complements Title TKs \"world-weary attitude,\" just as the sisters' \"tough lost years ...

In the Japanese release's liner notes, critic Mia Clarke described the slow ballad \"Off You\" as having a lackadaisical feel; Pitchfork Medias Will Bryant was struck by the song's creepy quality, and compared it to the mood of the Pink Floyd album The Wall. Rolling Stones Arion Berger said \"Off You\" is \"as direct and heartbreaking as an eighty-five-year-old blues recording, and Kim, her voice clear and full of hope, can't help sounding like a young woman who's lived ten awful lifetimes.\""]}, {"page": "The Power Out", "response": ["*Mia Clarke \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Axes (album)", "response": ["* Mia Clarke \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "No Shouts, No Calls", "response": ["* Mia Clarke \u2013 guitar, vocals"]}, {"page": "Blatchington Mill School and Sixth Form College", "response": ["* Mia Clarke (1994\u201399) musician; former guitarist with Electrelane"]}, {"page": "Rock It to the Moon", "response": ["# \"Long Dark\" (Ball, Mia Clarke, Dalley, Gaze, Susman) \u2013 9:20", "*Mia Clarke \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Andy Moor (The Ex)", "response": ["*Guitargument (2010, CD, with Mia Clarke, hellosQuare Recordings)", "*Why No Colour?
