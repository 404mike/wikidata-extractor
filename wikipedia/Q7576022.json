However, no variant of Latin orthography uses the lowercase letter \u27e8v\u27e9 in front of another consonant: in all forms of Latin orthography in lowercase, only the letter \u27e8u\u27e9 can stand before another consonant, and such a letter always represents the sound /u/, in the case of Seuso, for the Latin diphthong /eu/. In the Latin script variant where only uppercase letters are used, however, the spelling of SEVSO would be normal. Treasure (; ), is a hoard of silver objects (14 items) from the late Roman Empire. The first pieces appeared on the market in London in 1980, and the treasure was acquired by a consortium headed by Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton. Documentation was provided in which it was stated that it had been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of Lebanon. It was put up for sale in New York City in 1990 by Sotheby's, but was halted when the documentation was found to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia (now Croatia) and Lebanon made claims of ownership. The claims of ownership by these countries were rejected by a US court, and the treasure remained in the possession of the Marquess of Northampton. Scotland Yard still has an open case on the matter.", "The hoard first came to attention in 1980, when a single piece in the possession of two antiquities' dealers from Vienna was offered for sale in London.  Further pieces reached the market, and what is believed to be the complete hoard was acquired by a consortium headed by Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton.Antiques Trade Gazette , 30 September 2006.  Documentation supplied by the Lebanese embassy in Switzerland stated that the treasure had originally been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of Lebanon, and on that basis the consortium negotiated to sell the collection to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles for $10\u00a0million.  When that deal fell through, the treasure was put up for sale in New York in 1990 by Sotheby's, described as being from \"what was once the province of Phoenicia in the Eastern Roman Empire\"."]}, {"page": "Spencer (given name)", "response": ["**Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton (born 1946), British nobleman"]}, {"page": "List of Freemasons (A\u2013D)", "response": ["* Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton, Pro Grand Master, United Grand Lodge of England, 2001\u20132009UGLE.
