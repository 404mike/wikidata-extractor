This wasn't apparent from the off, however, and a return of just 5 points from the club's opening 6 fixtures did not hint at instant success for Davies, leaving influential and creative players such as Tommy Smith and I\u00f1igo Idiakez to depart the club prior to the closing of the August transfer window. However, a Steve Howard header in a 1\u20130 win at Wolves on 12 September 2006 proved a catalyst as the club lost only 4 of its next 27 fixtures (a run which included winning all 6 league fixtures in November 2006 and an 8 match winning streak, 6 league, 2 FA Cup, from 30 December 2006 up until 10 February 2007).

A resounding 5\u20131 win against Colchester United (by far the biggest win of a campaign which saw victory by a two-goal or above margin on just 6 occasions) looked to have put the club back on track but after taking just 12 points from the next 10 fixtures, the club slipped out of the automatic promotion places altogether and a 0\u20132 defeat at Crystal Palace in the penultimate game of the season confirmed a 3rd-placed finish and entry into the 2006\u201307 Championship playoffs."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["Others leaving the club were Tyrone Mears, who signed for Premier League club Burnley for a fee of \u00a3500k, rising to \u00a3600k with add-ons, Emanuel Villa, who moved to Mexican club Cruz Azul for an undisclosed fee, thought to be around \u00a31.7m, and Lewis Price joined Football League One Brentford on a season-long loan.
