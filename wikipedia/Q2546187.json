He moved to England in 2001 when he signed for Wigan Athletic and played an important part in the Wigan side that rose from the third tier (Division Two) to second (Division One) for the first time in the club's history and then went one step further to reach the top flight. Whilst at Wigan he started in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. He then left for Championship side Derby County where he achieved promotion to the Premier League for the second time, although Teale was not a member of the matchday 16 for the 2007 Football League Championship play-off Final. During his time at Derby, he spent time on loan with Plymouth Argyle and Barnsley.\nAfter three years and over 100 appearances for the club, Teale left Derby in June 2010 to sign for Sheffield Wednesday. Teale then moved to St Mirren in 2011, and he helped them win the Scottish League Cup in 2013. He became St Mirren manager in 2014, but left this position after the club were relegated in May 2015.
