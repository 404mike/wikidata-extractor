He was born in Manchester and educated at Clifton College, Bristol. He participated in two Formula 2 Grand Prix races counting towards the World Championship of Drivers, debuting on 19 July 1952.  He scored no championship points. He also participated in several non-championship races.\nCrook had a successful career as a racing driver outside of Formula 2 amassing nearly 400 win or place finishes between 1946 and 1955. His career ended after an accident that season, but he had been planning to retire in 1955 anyway. In his capacity as a motor dealer in Surrey Crook specialised in Bristols and became part owner of the Bristol company in 1960, before taking full ownership in 1973. He retained the sole ownership of Bristol Cars until 1997 and part ownership until 2002 but remained with the company until 2007, when he retired.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bristol Aeroplane Company", "response": ["In 1960, Sir George White was instrumental in preventing the car division being lost during the wider company's merger with BAC.
