Hobson is best known for his writing on imperialism, which influenced Vladimir Lenin and his theory of underconsumption.His principal and earliest contribution to economics was the theory of underconsumption, a scathing criticism of Say's law and classical economics' emphasis on thrift. However, this discredited Hobson among the professional economics community from which he was ultimately excluded. Other early work critiqued the classical theory of rent and anticipated the Neoclassical \"marginal productivity\" theory of distribution.\nAfter covering the Second Boer War as a correspondent for The Manchester Guardian, he condemned British involvement in the war and characterised it as acting under the influence of mine owners. In a series of books, he explored the associations between imperialism and international conflict and asserted that imperial expansion is driven by a search for new markets and investment opportunities overseas. Commentaries on Hobson have noted the presence of antisemitic language and themes in his work, especially in his writing on the Boer War.\nLater, he argued that maldistribution of income resulted, through oversaving and underconsumption, in unemployment and that the remedy was in eradicating the \"surplus\" by the redistribution of income by taxation and the nationalization of monopolies. He opposed the First World War and advocated the formation of a world political body to prevent wars. Following the war, he became a reformist socialist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ultra-imperialism", "response": ["However, the basic idea of a possible pacification of imperialism did not really originate from Kautsky. The British left-liberal John Atkinson Hobson had written in 1902 in a similar context about a potential inter-imperialism which could be established by a combination of great powers (combination or combine then being used to designate cartels).John A. Hobson: Imperialism, London 1902, 311. In 1907, Karl Liebknecht stated in his brochure Militarismus und Antimilitarismus that \"a trustification of all actual and potential colonies among the colonial powers, so to speak, [\u2026] a disabling of the colonial rivalry among the states [could take place in the future], as it occurred to some extent for the private competition among capitalist entrepreneurs in the cartels and trusts\".Karl Liebknecht: Schriften. Vol. 1., Berlin 1958, p. 269-270 (translated from German). On the eve of World War I, these peace-loving social-democrats and liberals in Europe hoped that the great powers\u2014beginning with the British Empire and the German Reich\u2014would unite into a states' cartel or a combination of states giving the rivals organization and reconciliation.Holm A.
