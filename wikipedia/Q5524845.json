Clail often worked with former The Pop Group singer Mark Stewart. The latter experimented with his band Mark Stewart & the Maffia, which consisted of New York session musicians Skip McDonald, Doug Wimbish, and Keith LeBlanc, who had been a part of the house band for the Sugarhill Records record label. Produced by Adrian Sherwood, the music combined hip hop with experimental rock and dub and sounded like a premature version of what later became trip hop. In 1993, Kirsty MacColl released \"Angel\", one of the first examples of the genre crossing over to pop, a hybrid that dominated the charts toward the end of the 1990s."]}, {"page": "The Stone Roses", "response": ["The Stone Roses' outdoor concert at Spike Island in Widnes on 27 May 1990 was attended by some 27,000 people, the support acts included; DJs Dave Haslam, Paul Oakenfold, Frankie Bones, Dave Booth, a Zimbabwean drum orchestra, and the reggae artist Gary Clail.

They released one LP Tackhead Tape Time in 1987 as \"Gary Clail's Tackhead Sound System\" and some of the most distinctive and well-known Tackhead tracks (some were released as 12-inch singles) date from this period particularly: \"What's My Mission Now?\", \"Mind at the End of the Tether\" and \"Hard Left\". These tracks combined funk basslines, hammerblow percussion and Sherwood's trademark sample-laden dub production and represent the defining Tackhead sound.", "Despite not recording any new material as Tackhead since, group members continued to record as the backing band or along with various Sherwood-led On-U Sound productions artists such as Gary Clail's solo efforts, African Head Charge, Dub Syndicate, New Age Steppers and others.
