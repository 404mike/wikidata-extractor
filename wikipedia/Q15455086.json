In September 2021, he launched the Food for the Future initiative, a programme with contributions from Jimmy Doherty and Jamie Oliver which aims to educate secondary school children about the food system and eliminating food waste. In the following month, he delivered a speech at the 2021 G20 Rome summit, describing COP26 as \"the last chance saloon\" for preventing climate change and asking for actions that would lead to a green-led sustainable economy. In his speech at the opening ceremony for COP26, he repeated his sentiments from the previous year, stating that a \"a vast military-style campaign\" was needed \"to marshal the strength of the global private sector\" for tackling climate change. In 2021, Prince Charles spoke to the BBC about the environment and said two days a week he eats no meat nor fish and one day a week he eats no dairy products."]}, {"page": "Oliver's Twist", "response": ["| Oliver makes paella for his friends, including his former classmate and best friend Jimmy Doherty.", "| Oliver again meets up with his best friend Jimmy Doherty who is a field scientist.
