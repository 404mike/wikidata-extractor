Professor John Curtice stated in January 2012 that polling had shown support for independence at between 32% and 38% of the Scottish population. This had fallen somewhat since the SNP were first elected to become the Scottish Government in 2007. The research also showed, however, that the proportion of the population strongly opposed to independence had also declined. Curtice stated in April 2014 that support for independence had increased since December 2013, although there was disagreement between the polling companies as to the true state of public opinion. Polls in the run-up to the referendum vote showed a closing of the gap, with one YouGov poll giving the Yes campaign a 51\u201349 lead. In the referendum Scotland voted against independence by 55.3% to 44.7%, with an overall turnout of 84.5%.", "In the year from September 2016 to September 2017, 25 of 26 polls conducted showed \"No\" as the most popular answer and only one showed \"Yes\" as the most popular answer. \"No\" continued to show a lead in opinion polls until July 2019, when one poll by Lord Ashcroft showed a narrow majority for \"Yes\".

For this reason, Butler and Kavanagh stated that the Referendum Party \"had only a limited effect on the Conservatives' fortunes\". On employing aggregate constituency data, Ian McAllister and Donley T. Studlar disagreed, arguing that the Referendum Party had a greater impact on the Conservatives than previous research suggested. They argued that the Referendum Party cost the Conservatives an average of 3.4% of the vote. Their analysis further suggested that there were 16 seats where the involvement of the Referendum Party directly cost the Conservative candidate their victory, and a further three where it was a contributing factor to the Conservatives' failure."]}, {"page": "Jeremy Corbyn", "response": ["The psephologist John Curtice wrote just before Corbyn's second leadership win: \"There is evidently a section of the British public, to be found particularly among younger voters, for whom the Labour leader does have an appeal; it just does not look like a section that is big enough, on its own at least, to enable Labour to win a general election\". Meanwhile, a poll for The Independent by BMG Research, suggested that working class voters were more likely to consider Corbyn \"incompetent\" than those from the middle class, and a higher proportion thought he was also \"out of touch\".
