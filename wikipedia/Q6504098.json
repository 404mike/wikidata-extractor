R. James ghost stories, which were broadcast annually by the BBC throughout the 1970s.These are:\n\nThe Stalls of Barchester (1971)\nA Warning to the Curious (1972)\nLost Hearts (1973)\nThe Treasure of Abbot Thomas (1974)\nThe Ash Tree (1975)\nThe Signalman (1976)\nStigma (1977)He also directed two other ghost stories: an adaptation of James' Casting The Runes in 1979 for Yorkshire Television, and an adaptation of K. M. Peyton's 1972 novel A Pattern of Roses in 1983, which was the acting debut of Helena Bonham-Carter. Elsewhere, Clark has directed four episodes of the 1979 series Flambards, which starred Christine McKenna, and later went on to be a director of continuing dramas for BBC One including Casualty, Pie in the Sky and Dangerfield.\nIn the 1980s he directed every episode of the television series Harry's Game (1982) and Jamaica Inn (1983), and in the 1990s two spy films in the Frederick Forsyth Presents series, as well as two more spy firms based on Jack Higgins's novels - Midnight Man (1996) and On Dangerous Ground (1997).\nA collection of Clark's original short stories entitled Telling Stories was published late 2011 by Avalard Publishing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "M.

The best-known adaptations include Whistle and I'll Come to You (1968, directed by Jonathan Miller) and A Warning to the Curious (1972; directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark), starring Michael Hordern and Peter Vaughan respectively. The latter was part of an annual BBC series titled A Ghost Story for Christmas, which would ultimately produce five dramatizations of James's stories in the 1970s: The Stalls of Barchester (1971), A Warning to the Curious (1972), Lost Hearts (1973), The Treasure of Abbot Thomas (1974) and The Ash-tree (1975).", "Although ITV produced four black-and-white adaptations of James's ghost stories between 1966 and 1968, no surviving copies are known to exist. However, a short preview trailer featuring several scenes from the 1968 adaptation of \"Casting the Runes\" survived and has been shown at cult film festivals. The trailer is also available on Network DVD's Mystery and Imagination DVD set. \"Casting the Runes\" was again adapted for television in 1979 as an episode of the ITV Playhouse series with Lawrence Gordon Clark directing and starring Jan Francis as the lead protagonist (a man in previous adaptations).

Partly because television is not best suited to carrying off big-screen pyrotechnics, but mainly because they want to keep faith with the notion of a ghost story in its literary rather than cinematic tradition.\"Wheatley, 51.
