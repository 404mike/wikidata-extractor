Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed it a more refined version of Pretzel Logic and \"another excellent record\" from Steely Dan in his retrospective review for AllMusic. In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield said the album completed a 1970s trilogy of albums, starting with Countdown to Ecstasy (1973), that was \"a rock version of Chinatown, a film noir tour of L.A.'s decadent losers, showbiz kids, and razor boys\". Jazz historian Ted Gioia cites it as an example of Steely Dan \"proving that pop-rock could equally benefit from a healthy dose of jazz\" during their original tenure, which coincided with a period when rock musicians frequently experimented with jazz idioms and techniques."]}, {"page": "Ian Jack", "response": ["After a false start as a would-be librarian, he joined The Glasgow Herald as a trainee journalist in 1965 and after a short spell in its head office was sent to work on two weekly papers in Lanarkshire, the now-defunct Cambuslang Advertiser and the East Kilbride News. Later he worked for the Scottish Daily Express at its Glasgow offices. In 1970, he joined The Sunday Times in London, where he became a section editor and then a foreign correspondent-cum-feature writer with a special interest in South Asia and particularly India, which he began to visit in the mid 1970s. From 1986 to 1989, he wrote for The Observer and Vanity Fair, and then joined the team that created The Independent on Sunday, which he edited from 1991 to 1995. His editorship of the quarterly Granta magazine, to which he had previously contributed as a writer, spanned 47 issues over twelve years to 2007. While at Granta, Jack also commissioned and edited books by Diana Athill, Simon Gray, Janet Malcolm and Travis Elborough, among others. He has contributed regularly to The Guardian since 2001, and began to write a weekly column for the paper six years later. He occasionally teaches at the India Institute, King's College London."]}, {"page": "Travis (given name)", "response": ["*Travis Elborough (born 1971), British author"]}, {"page": "Cornucopia (magazine)", "response": ["* Travis Elborough, The Guardian: \"\u2026 boasting pages with the sheen of baklava and sumptuous full-colour photography throughout (and the photos, many stunning, do have the edge over the words in amount of space occupied), Cornucopia \u2026 doesn't skimp on writing of quality either.\""]}, {"page": "Elborough", "response": ["*Travis Elborough, a British author"]}, {"page": "Words and Music by Saint Etienne", "response": ["* Travis Elborough \u2013 liner notes"]}, {"page": "Patrick N.
