He began his football career with Hebburn Argyle before joining Birmingham of the Football League Second Division in 1910. He marked his debut for the club, at home to Bradford on 10 September 1910, by scoring the only goal of the game, and played fairly regularly while Frank Foxall, also an outside left, was being tried at inside forward. The experiment failed, Foxall returned to the wing and McKay lost his place. When Foxall left, McKay played the first few games of the 1911\u201312 season, but lost his place again, this time to the newly arrived Jimmy Conlin, and in 1912 he returned to the north-east to join Blyth Spartans.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "McKay", "response": ["* Jack McKay (footballer, born 1885)", "* Jack McKay (footballer, born 1996)"]}, {"page": "Jack McKay", "response": ["Jack McKay may refer to:", "*Jack McKay (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u2013?), English football outside left for Hebburn Argyle, Birmingham and Blyth Spartans", "*Jack McKay (footballer, born 1996), Scottish football forward for Leeds United", "*Jack McKay (coach) (1886\u2013?), American college football and basketball coach"]}]}}
