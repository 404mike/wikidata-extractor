Soon scholars such as Hermann of Reichenau were writing texts in Latin on the uses and construction of the astrolabe and others, such as Walcher of Malvern, were using the astrolabe to observe the time of eclipses in order to test the validity of computistical tables."]}, {"page": "1120", "response": ["* Walcher of Malvern, an English astronomer and mathematician, creates a system of measurement for the Earth using degrees, minutes and seconds of latitude and longitude."]}, {"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| Walcher of Malvern || England ||   || 1135", "*Walcher of Malvern (England d. 1135)"]}, {"page": "Malvern, Worcestershire", "response": ["The first prior, Aldwyn, founded the monastery on his bishop's advice, and by 1135 the monastery included thirty monks.

John Kirtland Wright's (1925) summary is bleak: \"We may pass over the mathematical geography of the Christian period [in Europe] before 1100; no discoveries were made, nor were there any attempts to apply the results of older discoveries. ... Ptolemy was forgotten and the labors of the Arabs in this field were as yet unknown\". Not all was lost or forgotten; Bede in his De naturum rerum affirms the sphericity of the earth. But his arguments are those of Aristotle, taken from Pliny. Bede adds nothing original. There is more of note in the later medieval period. Wright (1923) cites a description by Walcher of Malvern of a lunar eclipse in Italy (October 19, 1094), which occurred shortly before dawn. On his return to England, he compared notes with other monks to establish the time of their observation, which was before midnight. The comparison was too casual to allow a measurement of longitude differences, but the account shows that the principle was still understood. In the 12th century, astronomical tables were prepared for a number of European cities, based on the work of al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b in Toledo. These had to be adapted to the meridian of each city, and it is recorded that the lunar eclipse of September 12, 1178 was used to establish the longitude differences between Toledo, Marseilles, and Hereford. The Hereford tables also added a list of over 70 locations, many in the Islamic world, with their longitudes and latitudes. These represent a great improvement on the similar tabulations of Ptolemy. For example, the longitudes of Ceuta and Tyre are given as 8\u00b0 and 57\u00b0 (east of the meridian of the Canary Islands), a difference of 49\u00b0, compared to the modern value of 40.5\u00b0, an overestimate of less than 20%. In general, the later medieval period is marked by an increase in interest in geography, and of a willingness to make observations, stimulated both by an increase in travel (including pilgrimage and the Crusades) and the availability of Islamic sources from contact with Spain and North Africa At the end of the medieval  period, Ptolemy's work became directly available with the translations made in Florence at the end of the 14th- and beginning of the 15th-centuries."]}, {"page": "1100s in England", "response": ["** Walcher of Malvern produces his first lunar tables."]}, {"page": "1090s in England", "response": ["** 18 October \u2013 Walcher of Malvern correctly predicts the time of a lunar eclipse."]}]}}
