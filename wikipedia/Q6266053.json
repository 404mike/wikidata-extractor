He took five wickets in an innings 22\u00a0times and had 10 or more wickets in seven matches. South Africa played England in a five-Test series that year and won the series 1\u20130. Verity was selected in the first four games. In the first, his figures were three for 52 in 41\u00a0overs on a pitch which assisted spin bowlers. England were in a position of dominance when rain ruined the game. Shortly afterwards, the tourists defeated Yorkshire; in the second innings, Jock Cameron hit 30\u00a0runs from a single over bowled by Verity. Arthur Wood, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, commented during the over: \"Go on, Hedley, you have him in two minds. He doesn't know whether to hit you for four or six!\"Bowes, p. 124. South Africa won the second Test match, their first Test win in England, although Verity took six wickets in the match. In the third game, Verity had bowling figures of two wickets for nine runs from 25\u00a0overs in the match and in the fourth, he took one for 72 from 40\u00a0overs. These two games were drawn, leaving England needing a victory in the final match. By now, Verity had acquired a reputation for being unable to take wickets on good batting pitches.  In the report on the fourth Test, Wisden's correspondent observed: \"Verity again failed to worry South Africa's batsmen\". With victory essential, Verity was dropped for the last match. He was replaced by off-spinner Johnnie Clay, regarded by critics as effective at flighting the ball."]}, {"page": "Glamorgan County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Johnnie Clay|| 1,292", "| Joe Hills and Johnnie Clay"]}, {"page": "John Clay", "response": ["*Johnnie Clay (1898\u20131973), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Wales national cricket team", "response": ["* Johnnie Clay: Clay played one Test match for England in 1935."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Johnnie Clay \u00b7"]}, {"page": "1973 in Wales", "response": ["**Johnnie Clay, Test cricketer, 75"]}, {"page": "1946 English cricket season", "response": [" || Johnnie Clay ||align=\"right\"| 4874 ||align=\"right\"| 204 ||align=\"right\"| 1742 ||align=\"right\"| 130 || 13.40"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Glamorgan never had a settled team and there were a number of new arrivals at the end of the season including Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Eaglestone, Norman Hever and Phil Clift. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand.

He was in business as a lace magnet in Derby, where he was a partner in Boden and Company Limited. He made a single appearance in first-class cricket for the Gentlemen of the North against the Gentlemen of the South at 1861 at Nottingham. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed for 2 runs in the Gentlemen of the North first-innings by Edward Hartnell, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for 6 runs by Frederick Miller. He organised the 1862 meeting between the two sides and would have played, had the death of his father not prevented him from doing so. He married Mary Shuttleworth in May 1866,The Sporting Life, 1906, p. 181 with the couple having seven children. Boden was present with his brother Walter at the inaugural meeting of Derbyshire County Cricket Club in November 1870 and can be considered a founding member.Ric Sissons, The Players: A Social History of the Professional Cricketer, 1988 He also served as a deputy lieutenant and justice of the peace for Derbyshire. Boden died at Marylebone in November 1908. His grandson, Timothy Boden, was also a first-class cricketer, while his great-nephew, Johnnie Clay, played Test cricket for England."]}]}}
