Spence, Farley and Green joined Johnny Kidd & the Pirates in 1962, but then Green left to join Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas in 1964.

He also made no secret of his dislike of \"Marguerita Time\", which he thought was too pop-orientated for the group. When they appeared on BBC's Top of the Pops to mime to the single, his place was taken by Jim Lea of Slade, who were also on the programme that week.

On the DVD Hello Quo, Parfitt claims that he had planned this action, although many people thought he was drunk.
