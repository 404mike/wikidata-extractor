His successor was Caroline Spelman.\nThe death of Mills from alcohol poisoning at Dolphin Square, London, caused the government of John Major to lose its parliamentary majority. This, along with the Wirral South by-election held a month later, resulted in Major announcing the 1997 general election less than 4 months later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["* 1997 Iain Mills (Meriden) died, no by-election held due to imminent general election"]}, {"page": "1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Iain Mills"]}, {"page": "1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Iain Mills"]}, {"page": "Mills (surname)", "response": ["*Iain Mills, British politician"]}, {"page": "Richard Burden", "response": ["He contested the parliamentary seat of Meriden at the 1987 general election, where he was defeated by the sitting Conservative MP Iain Mills by a margin of 16,820.
