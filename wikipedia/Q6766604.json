Among these organisations, the LGSM was formed by Communist Party of Great Britain activist Mark Ashton, and his friends, after the two men collected donations for the miners at the 1984 Lesbian and Gay Pride march in London. The London LGSM group met and fundraised in numerous locations, including the Gay's the Word bookshop. The group grew rapidly and moved out of Gay's The Word to a larger venue: The Fallen Angel, a gay pub in Graham Street, Islington. The London group was twinned with the Neath, Dulais and Swansea Valleys Miners Support Groups.", "In 2015, following the film's release, the surviving members of the organisation held a 30th anniversary reunion to raise funds for the Mark Ashton Fund, an HIV/AIDS charitable fund administered by the Terrence Higgins Trust. The group was chosen to lead the 2015 Birmingham Pride parade, in recognition of their historic status. They were also slated to lead the 2015 Pride in London parade, but withdrew in favour of marching further back in the parade after organisers refused to allow other affiliated groups, such as trade union contingents, to march immediately alongside the LGSM.

The most famous of these black CPGB activists, Claudia Jones, created Britain's first major black newspaper and founded London's Notting Hill Carnival, the world's second-largest annual carnival.

During the 1960s, CPGB activists raised money and equipment to donate to Vietnamese communists fighting in the Vietnam War.
