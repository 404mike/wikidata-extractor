Rob was asked by Terry George to race a new Elite model stock car as a test bed for future cars. He raced in seven meetings, including a meeting final win at Buxton. This got him into the World Championship Semi-Final, in which he finished second behind Gordon Moodie. He was disqualified from the World Final for using outside assistance in the form of another car on the centre green to straighten a bent nerf rail. Rob qualified on the front row for the 2011 World Final at King's Lynn, but failed to complete the first lap after being shoved into the fence on the first corner after a heavy rain shower on the parade lap had turned the shale track very slick. He also competed in the World Finals in 2012 at Barford, 2013 at Taunton (where he started from pole position) and 2014 at Cowdenbeath, all of which he failed to finish and were dominated by his battles with Moodie, particularly 2013 which saw the pair clash spectacularly in a battle for the lead and resulted in Speak's tarmac chassis being written off in the crash.  Then a year later, the duo had a run-in again, where Rob appeared to \"brake test\" Moodie on starting the second lap as he came to pass him, and this held both up.  The pair did not meet on track until 11 months later when they both qualified in the same World Championship Semi Final at Skegness.  They clashed again, and Speak took himself out of the race, and the 2015 World Championship in his efforts to stop Moodie. Speak won the 2013 British Championship at King's Lynn, after qualifying on the fifth row."]}, {"page": "BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars", "response": ["| World Champion ||  7 Gordon Moodie", "| National Points Champion ||  7 Gordon Moodie", "The most successful driver in World Final races is Rob Speak, who has won eight.
