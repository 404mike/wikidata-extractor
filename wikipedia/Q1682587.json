She wrote her first novel, Strange Evil, at age 14. It was published two years later and was described by John Grant as \"a major work of the fantastic imagination\", comparing it to George MacDonald's Lilith and David Lindsay's A Voyage to Arcturus. China Mi\u00e9ville lists Strange Evil as one of the top 10 examples of weird fiction whilst John Clute called it \"an astonishingly imaginative piece of fantasy by any standards.\"Gaskell's horror novel The Shiny Narrow Grin (1964) featured a sympathetic, tormented vampire and was described by Brian Stableford as one of the first \"revisionist vampire novels\", whose most successful exemplar was Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice. The Shiny Narrow Grin was also listed by horror historian Robert S. Hadji in his list of \"unjustly neglected\" horror novels.Her Atlan saga is set in prehistoric South America and in the mythical world of Atlantis. The series is written from the point of view of its clumsy heroine Cija, except for the last book, which is narrated by her daughter Seka.  In 1970 she received the Somerset Maugham Award for her novel A Sweet Sweet Summer (jointly with Piers Paul Read for his Monk Dawson). A Sweet, Sweet Summer features aliens visiting a violent future Earth; Baird Searles stated the book makes \"A Clockwork Orange look like Winnie the Pooh\".From the 1960s to the 1980s, Gaskell worked as a journalist on the Daily Mail. She later became a professional astrologer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1963 in literature", "response": ["*Jane Gaskell \u2013 The Serpent"]}, {"page": "Somerset Maugham Award", "response": ["* Jane Gaskell for A Sweet Sweet Summer"]}, {"page": "Tanith Lee", "response": ["Lee was inspired by writers and playwrights, including Graham Greene, Rebecca West, Elizabeth Bowen, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, Theodore Sturgeon, Angela Carter, Jane Gaskell, Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, William Blake, Anton Chekov, Harold Pinter, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Ibsen, August Strindberg, Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Bunin, James, Rosemary Sutcliff, Mary Renault, Jean Rhys, John Fowles, John le Carr\u00e9, Bront\u00eb family, E.M.
