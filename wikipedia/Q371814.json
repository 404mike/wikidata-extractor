The second chord is an A-chord, while the note in the melody above is A-flat. This is an unforgivable clash, something no one brought up knowing older music could ever have done. It is entirely unique, a stroke of genius...

In his comments on the Lennon\u2013McCartney composition, Steve Race remarked that Vaughn's arranger had altered the second chord to incorporate an A note, thereby \"taking all the sting out\" of the unorthodox change.
