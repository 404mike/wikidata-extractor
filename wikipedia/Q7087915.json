Stannard shows the beauty of the setting by painting in the fields beyond the river, woodland, and the buildings of the gentry, whilst also recreating the event using his artistic licence. Thorpe Frolic, Afternoon was praised by the Norfolk Chronicle, which described the work as \"intensely interesting, masterly and elegant\". The Norwich Mercury also admired his painting, noting it to be a work of great skill, and adding that it was a striking blend of fact and fiction. The painting is on display at Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery.

See  Trafalgar (1959) by Oliver Warner Several other vessels came to Santa Anas assistance and hemmed in Royal Sovereign on all sides; the latter, after being severely damaged, was relieved by the arrival of the rest of the British squadron, but was left unable to manoeuvre. Not long afterwards Santa Ana struck her colours. On the death of Nelson, Collingwood assumed his position as commander-in-chief, transferring his flag to the frigate HMS Euryalus. Knowing that a severe storm was in the offing, Nelson had intended that the fleet should anchor after the battle, but Collingwood chose not to issue such an order: many of the British ships and prizes were so damaged that they were unable to anchor, and Collingwood concentrated efforts on taking damaged vessels in tow.  In the ensuing gale, many of the prizes were wrecked on the rocky shore and others were destroyed to prevent their recapture, though no British ship was lost."]}, {"page": "Oliver warner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Oliver Warner "]}, {"page": "Warner, Oliver", "response": ["#redirectOliver Warner"]}, {"page": "Warner (surname)", "response": ["* Oliver Warner (1903\u20131976), British naval historian and writer"]}]}}
