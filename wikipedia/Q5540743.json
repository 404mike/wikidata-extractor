In 1929, he participated in an archaeological expedition in Petra organized by George Horsfield, and discovered at its northern boundary a Kebaran shelter that he named Wadi Madamagh.Mershen, p. 254.  That same year he published a five chapter article, \"Studies in the Topography and Folklore of Petra\", in the JPOS that included topographical maps with Arabic names for the features and sites that he collected from the local Bedouin population, along with oral histories associated with them. He also devoted a chapter to an ethnographic study of the Lijatne tribe, and politely dispelled their erroneous identification as \"Simeonites or other Beni-Israel\" by non-Arabic speaking authors, due to their sidelocks, noting it just happened to be a recent fashion among them at the time."]}, {"page": "Austen Harrison", "response": ["His next position (from 1923 onwards) was as Chief Architect to the Department of Public Works in the civil administration of British Palestine, which led to him designing various edifices in places such as Jerusalem and Amman. As the Chief Architect in Palestine from 1923 to 1937, Harrison was responsible for a number of buildings, none more impressive than the Rockefeller Museum. The museum, which was recently renovated, is an excellent example of Harrison's art. While the exterior is a wonderful amalgam of modern trends from the 1930s and traditional Middle Eastern themes, the interior is no less inspiring. Harrison once said that architecture is the \"sculpting of space\" and the museum is a testament to that sentiment. In designing the museum, he collaborated closely with Eric Gill, a widely renowned designer of the time. Much of the detailed work both inside and outside the museum are Gill's designs. Harrison also befriended George Horsfield, the Chief Inspector of Antiquities in Transjordan, and John Crowfoot, the second Director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem.Hood, p. 212, 214"]}, {"page": "Gerald Lankester Harding", "response": ["In 1936, Harding was appointed by the British Mandate government as chief inspector of Antiquities to succeed George Horsfield.Harding 1959, xiii With the help of his Bedouin assistant Hasan Awad who was also a superb archaeologist, Harding revitalised the Department of Antiquities and set about exploring, photographing, and cataloguing the sites and antiquities of Jordan.
