Publicly he was known for throwing tantrums, and could make \"snap judgements\" which he refused to back down from. In private though, Castro was actually skilled at keeping his anger in check and not allowing it to affect his judgement, simply becoming cold and withdrawn; S\u00e1nchez stated that in 17 years he had only seen Castro explode in anger twice, one upon being informed of his daughter Alina's defection in 1993."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Cuba", "response": ["*1991\u20131994: Leycester Coltman"]}, {"page": "List of Old Rugbeians", "response": ["* Sir Leycester Coltman, Ambassador to Cuba from 1991 to 1994 and to Colombia 1994\u20131998; author of The Real Fidel Castro"]}, {"page": "The Real Fidel Castro", "response": ["The Real Fidel Castro is a biography of the Cuban revolutionary and politician Fidel Castro, written by the British diplomat Sir Leycester Coltman (1938\u20132003) and first published by Yale University Press in 2003.
