The character first appeared in the series seven episode \"Stick or Twist\", broadcast on 15 February 2005. Mark was created as a new addition to the show's existing Williams family, entering as the ex-husband and father of established characters Tricia Williams (Sharon Maughan) and Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley) respectively. Powell stated that he was looking forward to the opportunity to develop the character over a longer period of time than with the briefer acting roles he was more used to taking.", "The character of Mark was created as an addition to the existing Williams family on the show, composed of established characters Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Mark's daughter, and Tricia Williams (Sharon Maughan), Mark's former wife. One series 7 plot strand saw Tricia diagnosed with breast cancer, and as Hobley explained: \"Chrissie is extremely supportive and they start to become much closer.\" When Tricia was abandoned by her boyfriend, plastic surgeon character Carlos Fashola, Chrissie took it upon herself to seek out her father, hoping to reunite her family before it was too late. It was revealed that Mark and Tricia had met when they were both training to be nurses, but that Mark had walked out on the two of them when Chrissie was a child, and had parted on bad terms with Tricia.", "Their relationship was severely tested when Chrissie made contact with Mark's father, Frank Williams. Robert Powell explained: \"\"Chrissie finds Mark's father for him but he has not spoken to his father for some time since they had a major falling out. What she does not know is that the issues between Mark and his father are nothing compared to the issues between Mark's father and Tricia, his daughter-in-law.\" Indeed, Tricia was extremely pensive about the reunion, even more so when Frank was taken ill and admitted to the hospital. Sharon Maughan expanded on the storyline: \"Tricia's horrified when Lisa tells her that Frank had a suspected stroke in the night and was rambling on about Chrissie being his daughter. At first, Tricia claims that Frank doesn't know what he is talking about because he is ill. But later, when Lisa finds her crying, she breaks down and reveals that Frank raped her when she was a teenager, during the time she was married to Mark.\" Tricia had Frank take a secret paternity test, confirming that he was indeed Chrissie's biological father.  As his condition deteriorated, she lied, claiming that he had expressed an instruction that he did not wish to be resuscitated. Frank died, and Tricia hoped that Chrissie's true paternity could remain a secret.", "Although Mark was desperate for Tricia to have chemotherapy, she proved reluctant, deciding that her previous cycles had been too grueling. Terrified that he might lose her, Mark proposed that they remarry.  Initially, Tricia turned him down, with Sharon Maughan explaining: \"She doesn't like the thought of saying 'til death do us part', knowing she's dying. Tricia's still in denial and doesn't want to admit she hasn't got long. She feels everything is accelerating out of her control.\" However, following an incident which saw the two characters taken hostage at work, Tricia rethought her decision. \"It scares her and makes her realise that Mark's always been there for her; he offers a safe place away from the crazy world that's out there\". The two remarried in the hospital peace garden in episode \"Now or Never\", with Chrissie and colleague Lola Griffin as witnesses. Tricia then underwent experimental surgery to excise her cancer, and she and Mark were delighted when it appeared to have been successful.  They planned a second honeymoon in New York City, however, en route to the airport were involved in a road traffic accident. Tricia suffered serious injuries, and although she was stabilized in theatre by Diane Lloyd, her condition soon thereafter worsened, leaving Mark and Chrissie conflicted over how to continue with her treatment.  Maughan explained: \"Mark and Chrissie have completely opposing views. He's desperate to do anything he can and wants to put Tricia on a life support machine, but Chrissie is saying 'Stop, she's never going to be the same'.\" Ultimately, the two agreed to let Tricia pass away in peace."]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2008", "response": ["| The Bank Job || Lionsgate / Mosaic Media Group / Relativity Media / Omnilab Media || Roger Donaldson (director); Dick Clement, Ian La Frenais (screenplay); Jason Statham, Saffron Burrows, Richard Lintern, Keeley Hawes, Stephen Campbell Moore, Michael Jibson, Georgia Taylor, Daniel Mays, David Suchet, Peter de Jersey, Gerard Horan, Don Gallagher, Craig Fairbrass, Peter Bowles, James Faulkner, Alki David, Colin Salmon, Hattie Morahan, Robert Whitelock, Julian Lewis Jones, Andrew Brooke, Sharon Maughan, Alistair Petrie, Rupert Frazer, Christopher Owen, Angus Wright, Rupert Vansittart, Taylor Samways, Kasey Baterip, Trevor Coppola, Bronson Webb, Julian Firth, Mick Jagger || Thriller"]}, {"page": "The Bank Job", "response": ["* Sharon Maughan as Sonia Bern"]}, {"page": "Dombey and Son (1983 TV series)", "response": ["*Sharon Maughan - Edith Granger (later Dombey)"]}, {"page": "She's Out of My League", "response": ["* Sharon Maughan as Mrs. McCleish, Molly's mother.", "Molly's parents, Mr. and Mrs. McCleish, are played by Alice Eve's real-life parents, Sharon Maughan and Trevor Eve."]}, {"page": "Anthony Head", "response": ["His first role was in the musical Godspell; this led to roles in television on both BBC and ITV, one of his earliest being an appearance in the series Enemy at the Door (ITV, 1978\u20131980).
