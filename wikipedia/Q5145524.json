He was a regular goalscorer with the club before joining Birmingham City in January 1988. Though an injury sustained in his second game caused him to miss the rest of the season, he played regularly in the 1988\u201389 season, but his goals were insufficient to prevent the club's relegation to the Third Division. Two relatively unproductive seasons with Hereford United, the highlight being scoring the opening goal in Hereford's 2\u20131 victory over Wrexham in the 1990 Welsh Cup final at Cardiff Arms Park, preceded his moving into non-league football with clubs including Worcester City, Bridgnorth Town, Halesowen Town and Shifnal Town.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Hereford United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Colin Robinson"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["The top scorers in league matches were Steve Whitton and Colin Robinson with five goals apiece; Whitton scored six, if goals scored in all competitions are counted.
