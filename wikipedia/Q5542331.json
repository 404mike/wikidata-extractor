Samson was from Carnoustie in Angus, 26 years old, and a seaman in the Royal Naval Reserve when he was awarded the VC.\n\nOn 25 April 1915 during the landing at V Beach on Cape Helles, Seaman Samson, along with three other men (George Leslie Drewry, Wilfred St. Aubyn Malleson, and William Charles Williams) was assisting the commander (Edward Unwin) of their ship HMS River Clyde, at the work of securing the lighters. He worked all day under very heavy fire, attending wounded and getting out lines. He was eventually seriously wounded by Maxim fire.While dressed in civilian clothes and on his way to a public reception in his honour, Samson was given a white feather.He later achieved the rank of petty officer and rejoined the Merchant Navy after the war, ultimately dying of pneumonia. He is buried in the new St. George's Military Cemetery off Secretary Lane in St. George's, Bermuda. His VC is in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London.", "link_mentions": {}}}
