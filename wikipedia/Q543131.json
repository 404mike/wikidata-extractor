He was later badly wounded while seeking a place to commit his reserve forces. Scott believed that Brown's decision to refrain from fully committing his strength at the outset of this battle resulted in the destruction of Scott's brigade and a high number of unnecessary deaths.Pierre Berton (1981), Across the Border: 1813\u20131814, Anchor Canada, p. 342 The battle ended inconclusively after General Brown ordered his army to withdraw, effectively bringing an end to the invasion.
