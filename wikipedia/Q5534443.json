She was one of the original group of scientists there during the 1950s that included notable figures such as Charlotte Auerbach, Geoffrey Beale, Douglas Scott Falconer, Henrik Kacser, Eric Lucey, Eric Reeve, and Alan Robertson. Waddington's initial solution to staff accommodation problems in Edinburgh was the acquisition of the nearby Mortonhall and an experiment in collegiate living, from which Eric Reeve's wife, the artist Edith Simon drew inspiration for her novel The Past Masters (titled House of Strangers in the USA).Simon, E.
