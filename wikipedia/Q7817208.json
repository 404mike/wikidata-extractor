The West Bottoms were then an immigrant section of town located at the \"bottom\" of the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River above which spread the more prosperous sections of Kansas City. James Pendergast, an alderman in Kansas City's city council, tutored him in the diversities of the city's political ways and systems and in the strategic advantages of controlling blocs of voters. James retired in 1910 and died the next year after he had named Tom as his successor. After his brother's death, Tom Pendergast served in the city council until he stepped down in 1916 to focus on consolidating the factions of the Jackson County Democratic Party.", "* Matlin, John S. \"Political party machines of the 1920s and 1930s: Tom Pendergast and The Kansas City Democratic machine\".
