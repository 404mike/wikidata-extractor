In less than 48 hours he is able to plant false memories in the team, posing as a member of Torchwood. It is this belief in him that allows him to survive. Accompanying the survival instinct, Adam shows a tendency to use his powers recreationally and maliciously. He provides a drastic role-reversal for both Toshiko, now a promiscuous extrovert who shares a passionate relationship with Adam, and Owen, now a shy geek with unrequited feelings for Toshiko. Adam also provides Jack with a resurgence of the repressed memories of the last pleasant memories of his family before his father's death and his brother's disappearance.  As a side-effect of such new memory creation, other memories must be forced from the mind, leading Gwen to totally forget Rhys. When Ianto looks over his diary and discovers no reference to Adam, Adam attempts to escape by torturing Ianto with false memories of being a serial killer, only for Jack to see through the lie thanks to his knowledge of Ianto's personality. Although Adam tries to threaten Jack by altering his few happy memories of his childhood, Jack nevertheless deals with Adam's existence by giving everyone in the team 48-hour amnesia pills.
