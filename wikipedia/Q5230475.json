As a Russian speaker, he got rare interviews with people involved in the Soviet space program. His non-fiction books covered actress Greta Garbo, science, speculative science such as possible future space colonies, starships using illustrations by known Space artists such as Fred Gambino and David A. Hardy. One interesting detail is that at a time when the belief that aliens visited Earth was common, he published a book on the subject and deliberately gave it a title and cover art to attract the 'true believers,' whereas the majority of the book's content was devoted to debunking a number of well-known UFO cases. He was the author of the science fiction comic Allan K\u00e4mpe, which was first published in December 1942. The stories at first glance seem to be a simple copy of Flash Gordon, but the comic has more in common with Sidney Jordan's, 'Jeff Hawke'. He also wrote a small number of youth novels. For his journalistic work Eugen Semitjov received Stora Journalistpriset, 'the grand prize for journalism,' in Sweden in 1972."]}, {"page": "List of minor planets named after people", "response": ["*13329 Davidhardy (David A.

Science fiction magazines and picture essay magazines were once a major outlet for Space Art, often featuring planets, space ships and dramatic alien landscapes.  Chesley Bonestell, R. A. Smith, Lucien Rudaux, David A. Hardy and Ludek Pesek were some of the major artists in the early days of the genre actively involved in visualizing space exploration proposals with input from astronomers and experts in the infant rocketry field anxious to spread their ideas to a wider audience. (Indeed, NASA's second administrator, James E. Webb, initiated the space agency's Space Art program in 1962, four years after its founding.)  A strength of Bonestell's work in particular was the portrayal of exotic worlds with their own alien beauty, often giving a sense of destination as much as of the technological means of getting there.", "* Visions of Space,  David A.
