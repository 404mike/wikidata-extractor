Bond actor Daniel Craig expressed concern over the character's absence, and expressed his hope that Q would return in Skyfall. In November 2011, it was announced that British actor Ben Whishaw had been cast in the role. Bond first meets Q in front of a painting at the National Gallery in London, where he at first expresses disbelief at the relative youth of his new quartermaster, but the two quickly earn each other's respect. In Skyfall, Q's gadgets were comparatively simple, consisting of a miniaturized radio and a gun coded to Bond's palmprint so only Bond could fire it. When Bond appears a little disappointed, Q comments 'Were you expecting an exploding pen? We don't really go in for that anymore,' in reference to a miniature grenade featured in GoldenEye. Q is demonstrated to be highly knowledgeable on the subject of computer security to the point where he designed some of the most sophisticated security protocols in existence. However, he is also somewhat short-sighted; while engrossed in the puzzle of a security system found on a laptop set up by Raoul Silva, the film's main antagonist, Q is unaware that he is inadvertently facilitating Silva's escape from MI6 custody as Silva's laptop hacks the MI6 computer network. After a hacking warning appears on his wall monitor, all the doors in the facility opens including the containment cell holding Silva, Q angrily yells to his techs to ask him how he got into their system. A message then appears on the laptop taunting Q, he unplugs it but he's too late and it quickly dawns on him that it was his actions that led to the hacking and Silva's subsequent escape. As with Desmond Llewelyn's Q, he also gets frustrated with Bond's knack for damaging or destroying the gadgets \u2013 at the end of Skyfall the Aston Martin DB5 is burned out in the final showdown with Silva."]}, {"page": "Ebertfest", "response": ["| Ben Whishaw, Alan Rickman, Rachel Hurd-Wood, Dustin Hoffman"]}, {"page": "Richard II (play)", "response": ["In summer 2012, BBC Two broadcast a filmed adaptation together with other plays in the Henriad under the series title The Hollow Crown with Ben Whishaw as Richard II."]}, {"page": "Arthur Rimbaud", "response": ["In a scene in I'm Not There (2007), a young Bob Dylan (played by Ben Whishaw) is portrayed identifying himself as Arthur Rimbaud by spelling Rimbaud's name and giving 20 October as his birthday."]}, {"page": "Rupert Grint", "response": ["On 13 February 2013, The Hollywood Reporter's Live Feed announced that Grint would star in a television pilot for CBS called Super Clyde.
