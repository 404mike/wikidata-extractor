During his stay, he planted the bomb under the bath in his room, number 629, five floors above Thatcher's suite for the conference. The device was fitted with a long-delay timer made from videocassette recorder components and a Memo Park Timer safety device.Parry, Gareth; Pallister, David. Timer clue to Brighton bombing, The Guardian; 10 May 1986 IRA mole Sean O'Callaghan claimed that 20\u00a0lb (9\u00a0kg) of Frangex (gelignite) was used.Clarke, Liam. IRA mole warned police about Brighton bomb, Sunday Times 15 December 1996 The device was described as a \"small bomb by IRA standards\" by a contemporary news report and may have avoided detection by sniffer dogs by being wrapped in cling film to mask the smell.", "Once investigators had narrowed the seat of the blast to the bathroom of Room 629, police began to track down everyone who had stayed in the room. This eventually led them to \"Roy Walsh\", a pseudonym used by IRA member Patrick Magee. Magee was tailed for months by MI5 and special branch, and finally arrested in an IRA flat in Glasgow. Despite days of interrogation he refused to answer questions \u2013 but a fingerprint on a registration card recovered from the hotel ruins was enough to convict him. He was arrested on 24 June 1985 with other members of an IRA active service unit while planning further bombings in England. Many years later, in August 2000, Magee admitted to The Guardian that he carried out the bombing, but told them he did not accept he left a fingerprint on the registration card, saying \"If that was my fingerprint I did not put it there\"."]}]}}
