In short, she was accused of an adulterous affair with a Captain Christopher Vaughan Foss. Leading the defamation campaign was a couple named Pelly. It appears that the motivation was jealousy over the social status of Sarah given her M\u00e9tis heritage. A three-day trial ruled in favour of Foss and awarded heavy damages but the apparent racial tensions were brought into the open. The situation was only resolved when Eden Colvile arrived in post, and dispatched the Pelly couple, Captain Foss, and the Ballendens away from the colony. John Ballenden took a posting at Fort Vancouver, his wife being too ill from childbirth to accompany him. In 1853 the husband arranged leave in Scotland and had his nephew, Andrew Graham Ballenden Bannatyne, accompany his family to Edinburgh.
