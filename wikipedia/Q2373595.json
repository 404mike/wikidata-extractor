On 8 May 1951, Pierrepoint and Dernley escorted convicted murderer James Inglis to the gallows immediately adjacent, and hanged him without delay \u2014 the fastest hanging on record, taking only seven seconds from the time his cell door was opened until his fatal 'long drop'.On 27 April 1954, Dernley was removed from the Home Office Official List of Assistant Executioners. Dernley claimed that no reason was given for his removal but he suspected it was because of a crude comment he had made about the size of the private parts of a executed man, John Kenneth Livesey, after he had been executed at Wandsworth prison in London on 17 December 1952.  Pierrepoint had alluded to such an incident (without mentioning Dernley by name) in his own autobiography. However, the real reason for Dernley's removal from the list was undoubtedly because in 1954 he had been convicted at the Nottinghamshire Quarter Sessions of publishing obscene material. The court sentenced Dernley to 6 months of imprisonment plus a fine of \u00a350, with costs of \u00a325 awarded against him. Dernley's criminal conviction and subsequent imprisonment constituted firm grounds on which to dismiss him.A welder in civilian life, Dernley was dubbed, as also has been Albert Pierrepoint, \"the last British hangman\", although in fact he was not (this title belongs jointly to Harry Allen and Robert Leslie Stewart). More accurately, he was one of the last surviving hangmen, following the deaths of both Pierrepoint and Allen in 1992.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albert Pierrepoint", "response": ["In a 1976 interview with BBC Radio Merseyside, Pierrepoint expressed his uncertainty towards the sentiments, and said that when the autobiography was originally written, \"there was not a lot of crime.

When the United Kingdom had capital punishment, there were generally no 'death rows'. The condemned were however separated from the general prison population in one of two 'condemned cells' located adjacent to the execution chamber. Sentenced inmates were given one appeal. If that appeal was found to involve an important point of law it was taken up to the House of Lords, and if the appeal was successful, at that point the sentence was changed to life in prison. The Home Secretary had the power to exercise the Sovereign's royal prerogative of mercy to grant a reprieve on execution and change the sentence to life imprisonment. Essentially the speedy process from conviction to execution, re-sentencing or reprieve meant that there were low numbers, (if any) prisoners under sentence of death at any one time and so there was no need for a 'death row'.  Assistant executioner Syd Dernley used the term \"death row\" in his 1990 memoir The Hangman's Tale to refer to the situation at Wandsworth Prison in April 1951 where, as only up to two persons could be hanged at one time, the execution of murderer James Virrels  had to await the prior double execution of murderers/robbers Joseph Brown and Edward Smith a day earlier, before going ahead on 26 April.Dernley & Newman The Hangman's Tale: Memoirs of a Public Executioner, Trans-Atlantic Publications, 1990  (page 151)"]}, {"page": "Sid Dernley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Syd Dernley"]}, {"page": "Dernley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Syd Dernley"]}]}}
