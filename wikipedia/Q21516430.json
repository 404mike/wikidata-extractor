He studied some of the tiniest beetles, which are the most difficult to identify. He described several species, notably in the genus Nicrophorus, and is the binomial authority for at least three. His collection passed to Philip Brookes Mason, of Burton-on-Trent, who edited some of Matthews' papers for posthumous publication.His chief interests were in the families Trichopterygia, Corylophidae and Sphaeriidae.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matthews (surname)", "response": ["* Andrew Matthews-Owen, Welsh pianist", "* Andrew Matthews (entomologist) (1815\u20131897), British clergyman and entomologist "]}, {"page": "Andrew Matthews", "response": ["Andrew Matthews may refer to:", "* Andrew Matthews (bobsleigh) (born 1988), British bobsledder", "* Andrew Matthews (entomologist) (1815\u20131897), British clergyman and entomologist", "* Andrew Matthews (author) (born 1957), Australian author"]}]}}
