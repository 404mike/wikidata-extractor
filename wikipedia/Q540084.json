Much of her work was concerned with the intersection of literature and Greek and Roman history. She spoke fluent Italian, German and French and presented lectures and conference papers around the world\u2014including in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Argentina, and Australia.Her commentaries on Senecan tragedy, Lucan, and Ovid's Fasti  in particular led to renewed interest in these subjects. Likewise her articles on aspects of the representation and realities of women at Rome remain a foundation for academic work in these areas.

It is possible, however, that no such epidemic of adultery even existed; the law should perhaps be understood not as addressing a real problem that threatened society, but as one of the instruments of social control exercised by Augustus that cast the state, and by extension himself, in the role of paterfamilias to all Rome.Edwards, pp. 34\u201336.

Ramage,  \u201cAspects of Propaganda in the De bello gallico: Caesar\u2019s Virtues and Attributes,\u201d Athenaeum 91 (2003) 331\u2013372. Ramage sees humanitas as belonging to a class of virtues encompassing \"kindness and generosity,\" associated in Caesar with qualities such as clementia (\"clemency, leniency\"), beneficium (\"service, favor, benefit\"), benevolentia (\"goodwill, benevolence\"), indulgentia or indulgeo (\"leniency, mildness, kindness, favor,\" or the verbal action of granting these), mansuetudo (\"mildness\"), misericordia (\"compassion, pity\"), and liberalitas or liberaliter (\"generosity\" or to do something \"freely, generously, liberally\"). virtus balances the potentially enervating effects of civilization in the natural aristocrat.Rhiannon Evans, Utopia Antiqua: Readings of the Golden Age and Decline at Rome (Routledge, 2008), pp. 156\u2013157 online. Caesar's prolific use of the word virtus\u00a0\u2014 fourteen instances in Book 1 alone, in reference to Celtic nations as a whole,Helvetii (1.1.4, 1.2.2, 1.13.4 thrice), Boii (1.28.4), Aedui (1.31.7). and to the Roman armyBellum Gallicum 1.40.4 and 1.51.1, and of the 10th Legion in particular at 1.40.15.\u00a0\u2014 points to \"no easily articulated essential meaning\": \"Virtus was whatever it was that Romans liked when they saw it.\"Andrew J.E. Bell, \"Cicero and the Spectacle of Power,\" Journal of Roman Studies 87 (1997), p. 9. Ariovistus claims the quality for his Germani and for himself (BG 1.36.7 and 1.44.1), but while this German virtus is affirmed by Gauls and merchants, causing unease among the army, it is downplayed by Caesar (1.39.1 and 1.40.8). On the rhetoric of virtus and competing claims to it in the Bellum Gallicum, see Louis Rawlings, \u201cCaesar\u2019s Portrayal of Gauls as Warriors,\u201d in Julius Caesar as Artful Reporter (Classical Press of Wales, 1998). Although the word appears frequently throughout the Bellum Gallicum, Caesar attributes the quality of virtus to only a few individuals: Troucillus; three Roman officers;Gaius Volusenus (3.5.2), Quintus Cicero (5.48.6), and Titus Labienus (7.59.6); see Myles Anthony McDonnell, Roman manliness: virtus and the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 308 online. The centurions Vorenus and Pullo bandy the word between themselves at 5.44. and two Celts, Commius of the Atrebates and Tasgetius of the Carnutes.Commius at Bellum Gallicum 4.21.7, the only instance of the word virtus in Book 4; Tasgetius at 5.25.2, in noting that having been installed as king by Caesar, he was murdered by his own people three years into his reign."]}, {"page": "Materiali e discussioni per l'analisi dei testi classici", "response": ["MD was founded by a group of scholars around the editor Gian Biagio Conte in Pisa in 1978.

According to Ovid, the ass was honored at the Vestalia as a reward for its service to the Virgin Mother, who is portrayed in Augustan ideology as simultaneously native and Trojan.Geradine Herbert-Brown, \"Fasti: the Poet, the Prince, and the Plebs,\" in A Companion to Ovid (Blackwell, 2009), p. 133; Carole E.

His perpetual erection results from sexual frustration, not potency; unlike satyrs, who are often but not always unsuccessful, Priapus never achieves sexual release, and thus lacks true generative power: Olender, \"Priapus,\" in Roman and European Mythologies, pp. 140\u2013142. was about to rape Vesta as she slept, the braying ass woke her. In revenge, Priapus thereafter demanded the ass as a customary sacrifice to him.Customary at Lampsacus, where his cult originated; Steven J.
