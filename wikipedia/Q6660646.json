David Chater of The Times described it as \"A wonderful episode \u2013 funny, exciting and strangely moving.\"Times review 10 May 2008 Martin Anderson of Den of Geek! stated that it was \"rather good \u2013 though badly plot-holed\". He noted that it was yet another episode of Doctor Who \"undermined by Murray Gold's incessant music\". He also described the episode as \"quite redolent of Tom Baker-era Who, with plenty of dark and cheap corridors to run down and two under-manned warring factions for the Doctor to bring peace to\". For SFX's Ian Berriman, the running up and down corridors was reminiscent of Lenny Henry's 1985 Doctor Who spoof featured on The Lenny Henry Show. Berriman described the episode as \"underwhelming\", citing that because one \"always suspect[s] she's a redshirt\" it is difficult to care for Jenny. Although \"reasonably diverting\", Berriman argues that budgetary constraints make \"the story feel so enclosed\" and that the episode's plot, likened to \"old-school Trek\", seems too similar to that of the Sontaran two-parter immediately prior to this adventure because both involve \"militarism\" and \"cloning\". Newsround's Lizo Mzimba also notes the similarities with \"The Sontaran Stratagem\" and \"The Poison Sky\". Mzimba asserts that the episode's \"biggest problem\" is that it tries \"to cram an enormous amount into 45 minutes\" with most of the \"interesting\" and new ideas not getting \"the attention they deserve\" resulting in the audience not caring about either the human fighters or the Hath and thereby limiting a \"sense of danger or menace\"."]}, {"page": "Jenny (Doctor Who)", "response": ["Martin Anderson of Den of Geek! has suggested that the creation of a daughter character for the Doctor was a move designed to lay to rest decades long speculation that the Doctor himself might one day regenerate into a female form.

Wow.\" Newsround Lizo Mzimba opines that Moffett's appearance as Jenny is \"superb\", while Doctor Who producer Phil Collinson has hailed the introduction of Jenny as the Doctor's daughter: \"One of the best pre-title sequences we've ever had.\" Despite reviewing the episode \"The Doctor's Daughter\" poorly as a whole, Digital Spy Ben Rawson-Jones argues that Jenny \"deserved a stronger narrative context for her debut\", and that Georgia Tennant portrayed the character with \"the right spirit, arrogance and compassion that befits a sprog of the Time Lord.\""]}, {"page": "Celebrity Mastermind", "response": ["| Lizo Mzimba || George Smiley Novels of John le Carr\u00e9 || 2nd "]}, {"page": "Ore Oduba", "response": ["Oduba joined Newsround in August 2008, following the departure of Lizo Mzimba and Laura Jones.

In 2010, he joined Shah to begin presenting the main Newsround bulletin double-headed. This continued until Shah's departure in November 2011.
