As of March 2015, he is a senior clinical research fellow at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, part of the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences. He is a founder of the AllTrials campaign and OpenTrials to require open science practices in clinical trials.Goldacre is known in particular for his Bad Science column in The Guardian, which he wrote between 2003 and 2011, and is the author of four books: Bad Science (2008), a critique of irrationality and certain forms of alternative medicine; Bad Pharma (2012), an examination of the pharmaceutical industry, its publishing and marketing practices, and its relationship with the medical profession; I Think You'll Find It's a Bit More Complicated Than That, a collection of his journalism; and Statins, about evidence-based medicine. Goldacre frequently delivers free talks about bad science; he describes himself as a \"nerd evangelist\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Homeopathy", "response": ["Jack Killen, acting deputy director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, says homeopathy \"goes beyond current understanding of chemistry and physics\". He adds: \"There is, to my knowledge, no condition for which homeopathy has been proven to be an effective treatment.\" Ben Goldacre says that homeopaths who misrepresent scientific evidence to a scientifically illiterate public, have \"... walled themselves off from academic medicine, and critique has been all too often met with avoidance rather than argument\". Homeopaths often prefer to ignore meta-analyses in favour of cherry picked positive results, such as by promoting a particular observational study (one which Goldacre describes as \"little more than a customer-satisfaction survey\") as if it were more informative than a series of randomized controlled trials."]}, {"page": "Kentish Town", "response": ["* Ben Goldacre, medical doctor and journalist"]}, {"page": "Placebo", "response": ["In his 2008 book Bad Science, Ben Goldacre argues that instead of deceiving patients with placebos, doctors should use the placebo effect to enhance effective medicines. Edzard Ernst has argued similarly that \"As a good doctor you should be able to transmit a placebo effect through the compassion you show your patients.\" In an opinion piece about homeopathy, Ernst argues that it is wrong to support alternative medicine on the basis that it can make patients feel better through the placebo effect. His concerns are that it is deceitful and that the placebo effect is unreliable. Goldacre also concludes that the placebo effect does not justify alternative medicine, arguing that unscientific medicine could lead to patients not receiving prevention advice."]}, {"page": "Committee for Skeptical Inquiry", "response": ["|Ben Goldacre"]}, {"page": "Bad science", "response": ["* The \"Bad Science\" column by Ben Goldacre in The Guardian", "* Bad Science (Goldacre book), a 2008 book by Ben Goldacre"]}, {"page": "GlaxoSmithKline", "response": ["In 2013, GSK licensed its HIV portfolio to the Medicines Patent Pool for use in children, and agreed to negotiate a license for dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor then in clinical development.

Based on positive trial data, reboxetine was originally passed as a treatment for depression in many countries in Europe and the UK in 2001 (though in practice it is rarely used for this indication). A 2010 meta-analysis concluded that reboxetine was ineffective and that the preponderance of positive-outcome trials reflected publication bias, mostly due to trials published by the drug manufacturer Pfizer. A subsequent meta-analysis published in 2011, based on the original data, found flaws in the 2010 analyses and suggested that the data indicated reboxetine was effective in severe depression (see Reboxetine \u00a7 Efficacy).
