Collier became a full-time professional writer in 1932. Before the war he was a novelist, travel writer, critic and broadcaster.He was in the Royal Air Force from 1940 to 1948, as a staff officer in Fighter Command to 1944. He worked in the Fighter Command HQ underground operations room and handled secret Ultra material from Bletchley Park. He assembled information about German long-range weapons, going to France and Belgium in late 1944, to investigate captured sites. He wrote that he was\n\n...the member of the intelligence staff of ADGB responsible for keeping the Chief Intelligence Officer, Vorley Harris and the Air Officer Commanding Sir Roderic Hill, informed about the threat from the rocket.\nFrom 1944 to 1945 he was at SHAEF headquarters in Versailles. At the end of the war in Europe he was appointed Air Historical Officer, Fighter Command. After leaving the RAF in 1948, he went to the Cabinet Office as a historian and wrote the official history volume The Defence of the United Kingdom; giving his address in the preface as Falmer, Sussex. Since 1957 he has been a free-lance writer on military topics. In 1964 he was married with three children and living in Sussex.His books Barren Victories and The Lion and the Eagle emphasize the importance he saw in the \"Anglo-Saxon\" alliance of Britain and America. A review of his A Short History of the Second World War by Dr Holley criticised his \"partisan\" overly British viewpoint and his reliance largely on secondary sources and on British sources, even for the war against Japan, where American forces predominated. A review by Robert Blake of a later biography of Sir Henry Wilson said that Collier's attempt to rehabilitate Wilson in his 1961 biography Brasshat carried little conviction, because of his uncritical admiration for Wilson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Strategic bombing during World War II", "response": ["The Blitz was underway. G\u00f6ring \u2013 at Kesselring's urging and with Hitler's support \u2013 turned to a massive assault on the British capital.Murray 1983, p. 52. On 7 September 318 bombers from the whole KG 53 supported by eight other Kampfgruppen, flew almost continuous sorties against London, the dock area which was already in flames from earlier daylight attacks. The attack of 7 September 1940 did not entirely step over the line into a clear terror bombing effort since its primary target was the London docks, but there was clearly an assumed hope of terrorizing the London population. Hitler himself hoped that the bombing of London would terrorize the population into submission. He stated that \"If eight million [Londoners] go mad, it might very well turn into a catastrophe!\". After that he believed \"even a small invasion might go a long way\".Ray, John, \"The Night Blitz\", Cassel & Co 1996,  p.103 Another 250 bomber sorties were flown in the night. By the morning of 8 September 430 Londoners had been killed. The Luftwaffe issued a press notice announcing they had dropped more than 1,000,000 kilograms of bombs on London in 24 hours. Many other British cities were hit in the nine-month Blitz, including Plymouth, Birmingham, Sheffield, Liverpool, Southampton, Manchester, Bristol, Belfast, Cardiff, Clydebank, Kingston upon Hull and Coventry. Basil Collier, author of 'The Defence of the United Kingdom', the HMSO's official history, wrote:", "In addition to the conclusions of Basil Collier to that effect there are also, for example, the 1949 memoirs of General Henry H. Arnold who had been in London in 1941 and supported Collier's estimate. Harris noted in 1947 that the Germans had failed to take the opportunity to destroy English cities by concentrated incendiary bombing.Boog 2001, p. 365."]}, {"page": "History of the Second World War", "response": ["* Defence of the United Kingdom, Basil Collier, 1957"]}, {"page": "V-weapons", "response": ["V-weapons, known in original German as  (, German: \"retaliatory weapons\", \"reprisal weapons\"), were a particular set of long-range artillery weapons designed for strategic bombing during World War II, particularly Strategic bombing and/or aerial bombing of cities.Basil Collier (1976) The Battle of the V-Weapons. Morley, The Elmfield Press. p. 138. They comprised the V-1, a pulsejet-powered cruise missile; the V-2, a liquid-fueled ballistic missile (often referred to as V1 and V2); and the V-3 cannon. All of these weapons were intended for use in a military campaign against Britain, though only the V-1 and V-2 were so used in a campaign conducted 1944\u201345. After the invasion of Europe by the Allies, these weapons were also employed against targets on the mainland of Europe, mainly France and Belgium. Strategic bombing with V-weapons killed approximately 18,000 people, mostly civilians. The cities of London, Antwerp and Li\u00e8ge were the main targets.Pieter Serrien (2016) Elke dag angst. Antwerp, Horizon.", "As early as 28 June 1940, a strategic bombing rationale had been advanced for the A4 (V-2 rocket) being developed at a meeting between Army Ordnance Chief Emil Leeb and Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht, Walther von Brauchitsch. Following the relative failure of the Baedeker Raids on Britain in 1942, development of both flying bomb and rocket accelerated, with Britain designated as the target.Basil Collier (1976) The Battle of the V-Weapons. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 15\u201316. On 29 September 1943, Albert Speer publicly promised retribution against the mass bombing of German cities by a \"secret weapon\". Then the official 24 June 1944 Reich Propaganda Ministry announcement of the \"Vergeltungswaffe 1\" guided missile implied that there would be another such weapon. After the first operational A-4 launch in September 1944, the rocket was renamed the V-2. (although no one knows exactly who gave it this name). However, the V-2 operations manual distributed to firing batteries continued to use the A-4 name for the rocket.", "Beginning in October 1943, launch sites for the V-1 were constructed in Northern France, along the coast from Calais to Le Havre. Aerial bombing attacks on these sites by the Allied airforce were only partially successful, and by June 1944 they were ready for action.Basil Collier (1976) The Battle of the V-Weapons. Morley, The Elmfield Press: . Prompted by the Normandy Landings of 6 June, in the early morning of 13 June 1944, the first V-1 flying bomb attack was carried out on London.Angus Calder (1971) The People's War: Britain 1939\u20131945: 645. Ten missiles were launched, of which four reached England. The first of these impacted near Swanscombe, causing no casualties. At Bethnal Green, however, a bridge was destroyed, six people killed and nine injured.Basil Collier (1976) The Battle of the V-Weapons. Morley, The Elmfield Press: . After  the attacks became sustained at a rate of about 100 a day. With the first attack the British put their pre-planned Operation Diver (after their codename \"Diver\" used for the V-1) into action.", "The buzzing sound of the V-1's pulse jet engine was likened by some to \"a motor cycle in bad running order\". As it reached its target and dove, there would be a distinct sound of the propulsion unit spluttering and cutting out; the eerie hush before impact which followed was quite terrifying, according to observers. The brief interval of silence before detonation was also a warning to seek shelter (later V-1s were corrected to have the originally intended power dive).Basil Collier (1976) The Battle of the V-Weapons. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 80.  At least one business in London advertised how quickly a patron could access a nearby shelter. Despite this, the cloudy and rainy conditions of June and July aided the effectiveness of the weapon, and casualties were high. By late August a million and a half people had left London, and the rate of work production was affected.Basil Collier (1976) The Battle of the V-Weapons. Morley, The Elmfield Press:  By the late summer and autumn, however, increasingly effective countermeasures against the V-1 were taken, and people started returning to London.Angus Calder (1971) The People's War: Britain 1939\u20131945: ", "V-2 rocket launching sites were set up by the Germans around The Hague in the Netherlands on 6 September 1944. The first was launched from here against London on 8 September 1944 and took an estimated 5 minutes to fly the  from the Hague to London, where it struck at 6:43pm on 8 September on Chiswick, causing 13 casualties.Basil Collier (1976) The Battle of the V-Weapons. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 113, 170. As the V-2 explosions came without warning, the government initially attempted to conceal their cause by blaming them on defective gas mains. However, the public was not fooled and soon began sardonically referring to the V-2s as \"Flying gas pipes\".", "By October the offensive became sustained. A particularly devastating strike was on 25 November 1944, when a V-2 exploded at the Woolworth's store in New Cross Road, killing 168 people and seriously injuring 121.Basil Collier (1976) The Battle of the V-Weapons. Morley, The Elmfield Press: 129. Intercepting the supersonic V-2 missiles in flight proved virtually impossible, and other countermeasures, such as bombing the launch sites, were fairly ineffectual. Sustained bombardment continued until March 1945. The final missiles arrived on 27 March 1945, with one of them killing 134 people and injuring 49 when it hit a block of flats in Stepney.Basil Collier (1976) The Battle of the V-Weapons.
