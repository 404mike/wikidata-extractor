Collier became a full-time professional writer in 1932. Before the war he was a novelist, travel writer, critic and broadcaster.He was in the Royal Air Force from 1940 to 1948, as a staff officer in Fighter Command to 1944. He worked in the Fighter Command HQ underground operations room and handled secret Ultra material from Bletchley Park. He assembled information about German long-range weapons, going to France and Belgium in late 1944, to investigate captured sites. He wrote that he was\n\n...the member of the intelligence staff of ADGB responsible for keeping the Chief Intelligence Officer, Vorley Harris and the Air Officer Commanding Sir Roderic Hill, informed about the threat from the rocket.\nFrom 1944 to 1945 he was at SHAEF headquarters in Versailles. At the end of the war in Europe he was appointed Air Historical Officer, Fighter Command. After leaving the RAF in 1948, he went to the Cabinet Office as a historian and wrote the official history volume The Defence of the United Kingdom; giving his address in the preface as Falmer, Sussex. Since 1957 he has been a free-lance writer on military topics. In 1964 he was married with three children and living in Sussex.His books Barren Victories and The Lion and the Eagle emphasize the importance he saw in the \"Anglo-Saxon\" alliance of Britain and America. A review of his A Short History of the Second World War by Dr Holley criticised his \"partisan\" overly British viewpoint and his reliance largely on secondary sources and on British sources, even for the war against Japan, where American forces predominated. A review by Robert Blake of a later biography of Sir Henry Wilson said that Collier's attempt to rehabilitate Wilson in his 1961 biography Brasshat carried little conviction, because of his uncritical admiration for Wilson.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
