Corbin was following his own agenda in his dispatches as he wanted to convince Daladier and other decision-makers in Paris that the British public and the government were starting to favor \"firmness\" towards the Reich as a way to undercut Bonnet's foreign policy of giving Germany a \"free hand in the East\" in exchange for leaving France alone. Corbin reported that there was a growing demand in Britain for \"if not conscription pure and simple, at least a form of 'national service'\". In November 1938, Corbin reported that one public opinion poll showed that the majority of the British people favored a \"national registry\" of young men. At the same time, Corbin told the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, that there was growing defeatism in France and that Bonnet had his own agenda of reaching an understanding with the Reich that might very well be at Britain's expense. To counter Bonnet, Corbin urged Halifax that Britain should make an effort to stand by France such as making the \"continental commitment\", saying that as long the French believed the British \"would fight to the last Frenchman\", the appeal of Bonnet would continue to grow. On 1 November 1938, Lord Halifax in a dispatch to Sir Eric Phipps, the British ambassador in Paris, stated his fear that France: \"turn so defeatist as to give up the struggle of maintaining adequate forces even for the safety of metropolitan France\".
