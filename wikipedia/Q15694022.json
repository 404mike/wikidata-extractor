It was established to provide a professional training for actors that went beyond the rather staid traditions of the established drama schools: at the time, the Central School of Speech and Drama would examine prospective students' teeth, like a horse, to see if they had the teeth of a professional actor. Argent and his team believed that the authentic spirit of an actor, even if contained within a less-than-conventionally-perfect body, was more important."]}, {"page": "Cargill (surname)", "response": ["*John Cargill Thompson, Scottish dramatist specialising in one-person plays", "*John Cargill Thompson (1938-2000), Scottish dramatist"]}, {"page": "Helen Cargill Thompson", "response": ["Born in Burma where her father worked as a merchant trader, in 1939, Thompson, her parents and two brothers returned to Glasgow to live with her grandparents in Mirrlees Drive, close to Glasgow Botanic Gardens.
