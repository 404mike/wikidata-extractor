Guitarist Mick Grabham offered up his only composition, set to Reid's \"The Mark of the Claw\", to help fill out the album (on the 2009 Salvo reissue, Grabham is incorrectly credited with writing the single \"Wizard Man\" with Reid). The Alberts insisted that the band's steady drummer B.J. Wilson use a click track for the album, an unusual demand given his work on the band's previous releases. After this album was released, Copping left the band. Dee Murray (Elton John's bassist) replaced him for the North American tour promoting this album.Roland Clare, booklet notes for \"Something Magic reissue, 2009", "The album was preceded by the single \"Wizard Man\", backed by Gary Brooker's instrumental \"Backgammon\" in the UK but paired with \"Something Magic\" in the United States. The single didn't chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States, and the album rose no higher than No. 146 on the U.S. Billboard charts. It debuted at No. 13 in Denmark,http://danskehitlister.dk/?song_id=2470 before falling out of the Top 20. Something Magic would remain the last album released by Procol Harum until 1991, when Gary Brooker reunited with Keith Reid, Robin Trower, and Matthew Fisher (drummer B.J. Wilson having died prior to the reunion) for The Prodigal Stranger."]}, {"page": "The Long Goodbye (Procol Harum album)", "response": ["Unlike all the other songs on the album, the title track has never been officially released by Procol Harum. It was a Gary Brooker solo single and included on the Gary Brooker solo album Echoes in the Night, which was co-produced by Brooker and Fisher, who also co-composed the song's music. Its lyrics were written by Procol Harum's Keith Reid and Procol's B.J. Wilson played drums on the track."]}, {"page": "Matthew Fisher (musician)", "response": ["The arrival of guitarist Robin Trower and drummer B.J. Wilson to Procol Harum in mid-1967 seemed to bring some stability to the band. Fisher's first official songwriting credit was for the instrumental \"Repent Walpurgis\" on the band's debut album, which was transformed by Trower playing a blues-influenced solo over the top of Fisher's classically influenced organ lines. Nevertheless, in response to his lack of co-writing credits (particularly over \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\"), being at odds with Brooker, Trower and Wilson (who had all grown up together in Southend on Sea and previously played in The Paramounts), and still suffering from the death of his father in 1965, Fisher wanted to leave Procol Harum. Despite being talked out of it, he would continue to attempt to leave the band on several occasions over the next two and a half years until finally departing at the end of 1969."]}, {"page": "Ain't Nothin' to Get Excited About", "response": ["Strictly speaking, this is not a Procol Harum album; it was recorded shortly after the band had finished working on their 1970 album Home. During these recording sessions, producer Chris Thomas asked the band to play some old favourites while he set up the equipment for recording. The band enjoyed playing these older songs, so a few months later Thomas booked the Abbey Road recording studio, and the band recorded all the tracks on this album in a single night.  \"We staggered out at dawn, having attempted about 45 songs. We didn't finish them all. I think the drummer collapsed half way through with laughter.\"Gary Brooker, quoted in notes to CD by Chris Welch, 2002 \"Well, I...\" is the only song they played that was written by the group, and is drummer B.J. Wilson's sole songwriting credit.", "* B.J. Wilson\u00a0\u2013 drums"]}]}}
