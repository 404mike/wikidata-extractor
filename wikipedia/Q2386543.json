In \"Touch of My Hand\", which Spears felt it was comparable to Janet Jackson's \"That's the Way Love Goes\" (1993), she sings in a lower register. The instrumentation contains elements of music from the Far East (particularly in its use of the Chinese instrument, the erhu) and its lyrics refer to masturbation, \"I will be bold/ Going to the places where I can be out of control/ Don't want to explain tonight/ All the things I try to hide.\" The ninth track \"The Hook Up\" has a reggae feel and features Spears singing in a Jamaican Patois accent. The power ballad \"Shadow\" talks about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he\u2019s gone. \"Brave New Girl\" lyrics talk about a young woman finding her passion and losing inhibitions. Backed by choppy, electro-funk beats, she sings in a bouncy near-rap, \"She's gonna pack her bags, she's going to find her way, she's going to get right out of this/ She don't want New York, she don't want L.A., she's going to find that special kiss.\" The Eurodance and pop song incorporates elements of the music of No Doubt, Blondie and Madonna. \"Everytime\" begins with a piano introduction accompanying Spears's breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong throughout the song. \"Everytime\" lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, the singer explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as \"Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small\". During an interview with MTV, Spears said about the song, \"It's about heartbreak, it's about your first love, your first true love. That's something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you're going to be with the rest of your life.\" When asked if \"Everytime\" was about Timberlake, she responded \"I'll let the song speak for itself.\" The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix of \"Me Against the Music\" removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. In \"The Answer\", Spears sings that her lover is the answer to all her needs: \"Who can hold me tight, keep me warm through the night? / Who can wipe my tears when it's wrong, make it right? / Who can give me love till I'm satisfied? / Who's the one I need in my life?\".
