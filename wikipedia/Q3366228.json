Similarities between Sanskrit and European languages were first noted in the early 16th centuryThis is noted in Juan Mascaro's introduction to his translation of the Bhagavad Gita, in which he dates the first Gita translation to 1785 (by Charles Williams). Mascaro claims the linguist Alexander Hamilton stopped in Paris in 1802 after returning from India, and taught Sanskrit to the German critic Friedrich von Schlegel. Mascaro says this is the beginning of modern study of the roots of the Indo-European languages. and led to speculation of a common ancestor language from which all these descended. It is now named Proto-Indo-European. Philology's interest in ancient languages led to the study of what were, in the 18th century, \"exotic\" languages, for the light they could cast on problems in understanding and deciphering the origins of older texts."]}, {"page": "Sanskrit", "response": ["Scholars such as William Jones and his colleagues felt the need for systematic studies of Sanskrit language and literature.

Schlegel nurtured his own students into influential European Sanskrit scholars, particularly through Franz Bopp and Friedrich Max Muller.
