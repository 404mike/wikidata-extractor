On 27 January 2018, De Vries replaced Gordon at half-time shortly after the latter suffered a knee injury in the 1\u20130 win over Hibernian. This gave De Vries an extended run in the side, taking in Scottish Premiership clashes with Aberdeen, Hearts, Kilmarnock, and St Johnstone, Scottish Cup victories over first Partick Thistle and then Greenock Morton, and De Vries' UEFA Europa League d\u00e9but, which came against Zenit Saint Petersburg. Celtic exited the Europa League after a 3\u20131 aggregate defeat to Zenit; the Russians' second goal, described by De Vries as a \"knuckleball\", deceived him, and it is his belief that his side never recovered from that concession. De Vries was injured in training on 9 March and replaced by Scott Bain in the match with Rangers two days later, and made no further appearances in the 2017\u201318 season, finishing with 10 appearances: two in the Scottish Cup, two in the Europa League, and six in the League."]}, {"page": "Kyle Letheren", "response": ["Letheren played as first-choice goalkeeper for Dundee throughout all of the 2013\u201314 season.

Letheren played the first ten matches at the start of the 2014\u201315 season before injuring his knee in a warm up against Motherwell. It was later announced that he would be out until December. After making his return against Partick Thistle and St Mirren, Letheren was once again sidelined after suffering an injury in the warm-up ahead of the Dundee derby against Dundee United, which allowed Arvid Schenk to take his place, although Schenk went on to concede six goals, in a 6\u20132 loss. Though he recovered from his injury, Letheren lost his first choice goalkeeper status to Scott Bain throughout the season.
