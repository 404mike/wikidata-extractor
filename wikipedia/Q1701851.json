He was studying Oriental languages at Jesus College, Oxford when Sir Godfrey Rolles Driver, a lecturer in Semitic philology, nominated him to join the Scrolls editorial team.\nAlthough Strugnell had no previous experience in palaeography, he learned very quickly how to read the scrolls. He would be involved in the Dead Sea Scrolls project for more than 40 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dead Sea Scrolls", "response": ["According to former chief editor of the Dead Sea Scroll editorial team John Strugnell, there are at least four privately owned scrolls from Cave 11, that have not yet been made available for scholars. Among them is a complete Aramaic manuscript of the Book of Enoch.", "Publication of the scrolls has taken many decades, and delays have been a source of academic controversy. The scrolls were controlled by a small group of scholars headed by John Strugnell, while a majority of scholars had access neither to the scrolls nor even to photographs of the text. Scholars such as Norman Golb, publishers and writers such as Hershel Shanks, and many others argued for decades for publishing the texts, so that they become available to researchers. This controversy only ended in 1991, when the Biblical Archaeology Society was able to publish the \"Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls\", after an intervention of the Israeli government and the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA). In 1991 Emanuel Tov was appointed as the chairman of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation, and publication of the scrolls followed in the same year."]}, {"page": "John M. Allegro", "response": ["One result of this letter seemed to be that his appointment at Manchester was not to be renewed.This was Allegro's view, stated in a letter to John Strugnell dated 6 February 1957, cited in  However, in July after several uneasy months the appointment was renewed.", "John Strugnell published a severe critique of the volume, \"Notes en Marge du volume V des 'Discoveries in the Judean Desert of Jordan'\" in Revue de Qumran. Allegro's minimalist approach has received widespread scorn in the scholarly world, which nevertheless had the opportunity to analyse the Allegro texts for decades while waiting for other editors to publish their allotments. The first part of Strugnell's allotment was published in 1994."]}, {"page": "Roland de Vaux", "response": ["As de Vaux worked at Qumran and its vicinity more scrolls were found and these discoveries brought a small group of young scholars of Hebrew to work on them. These scholars, some of whom worked on their allotted scrolls for decades, included J\u00f3zef Milik, John Marco Allegro and John Strugnell."]}, {"page": "Robert Eisenman", "response": ["With his attempts to get free access to the Scrolls, Eisenman claims he was the first to call for AMS Carbon dating the Dead Sea ScrollsCf. M. Baigent and R. Leigh, The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception, London/New York, 1991, pp. 80\u201383. (the earliest carbon dating tests \u2013 non-AMS \u2013 were performed 14 November 1950 on a piece of linen from Qumran Cave 1, producing a date range being 167\u00a0BCE \u2013 233\u00a0CE.) Libby had first started using the dating method in 1946 and early testing required relatively large samples that were destroyed, so testing on scrolls only became feasible when methods used in the dating process were improved upon.Doudna, G. \"Carbon-14 Dating\", in Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Schiffman, Lawrence & VanderKam, James, eds., Vol.1 (Oxford: 2000) F. E. Zeuner carried out tests on date palm wood from the Qumran site yielding a date range of 70\u00a0BCE \u2013 90\u00a0CE. In 1963 Libby tested a sample from the Isaiah Scroll, which gave a range between 200\u00a0BCE \u2013 1\u00a0CE.Carmi, Israel, \"Radiocarbon Dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls\" in The Dead Sea Scrolls: Fifty Years after their Discovery. 1947\u20131997, Schiffman, Lawrence, Tov, Emanuel, & VanderKam, James, eds., (Jerusalem: IES, 2000) p.881.

This early date is proposed based on an evaluation of its content. The congenial tone of the letter from the author to the recipients suggests a composition of the text to a time either before or contemporaneous with the earliest organizational stages of the Qumran community.Elisha Qimron, John Strugnell, et al., Qumran Cave 4.V: Miq\u1e63at Ma\u02bfa\u015beh Ha-Torah, DJD 10 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994), 121.

In 1979, Hebrew scholar Elisha Qimron joined him to assist in the publication of 4QMMT. The text was officially published in 1994, in the series Discoveries in the Judean Desert.", "The genre of the text was initially identified by Strugnell and Qimron as a personal letter.
