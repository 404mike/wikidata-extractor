From the 1980s onwards, crossover artists such as Katherine Jenkins, Charlotte Church and Aled Jones began to come to the fore.

Modern Welsh composers such as Alun Hoddinott and William Mathias produced large scale orchestrations, though both have returned to religious themes within their work. Both men would also explore Welsh culture, with Mathias setting music to the works of Dylan Thomas, while Hoddinott, along with the likes of Mervyn Burtch and David Wynne, would be influenced by the poetic and mythical past of Wales."]}, {"page": "John Piper (artist)", "response": ["Piper continued to write extensively on modern art in books and articles.\"The Listener articles 1933\u2013\"Young English Painters: Contemporary English Drawing\"\"Lost, A Valuable Object\" an essay in Myfanwy Piper's anthology \"The Painter's Object\", 1937.\"England's Early Sculptors\", Architectural Review, 1937.
