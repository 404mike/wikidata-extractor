The church sponsored his music studies, but family circumstances prevented him proceeding to college, and he had to take a position as a pupil-teacher.  In 1893, having suffered serious ill-health, he abandoned teaching for music.\nIn 1898, Evans formed two choirs in the Merthyr area, one for men and one for women.  His male voice choir won first prize at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1900, and he was conductor in the following year when the National Eisteddfod was held in Merthyr.  After several eisteddfod successes, he became musical director of the Liverpool Welsh Choral Union.  In 1913 he became musical director at University of Wales, Bangor, and conducted the Liverpool Philharmonic Society and the North Staffordshire Choral Society.  He conducted Granville Bantock's Vanity of Vanities, which was dedicated to Evans by the composer.\nAfter his death, a hymn-tune named In Memoriam was composed by Caradog Roberts in his memory and included in several Welsh hymnaries. He is buried at Toxteth Park Cemetery in Liverpool.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1914 in music", "response": ["*July 23 \u2013 Harry Evans, conductor and composer (b. 1873)"]}, {"page": "1873 in music", "response": ["*May 1 \u2014 Harry Evans, composer (d. 1914)"]}, {"page": "Cwm Rhondda", "response": ["John Hughes wrote the first version of the tune, which he called \"Rhondda\", for the Cymanfa Ganu (hymn festival) in Pontypridd in 1905, when the enthusiasm of the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival still remained.\"Caniadau'r Diwygiad\", Noel Gibbard, 2003,  The present form was developed for the inauguration of the organ at Capel Rhondda, in Hopkinstown in the Rhondda Valley, in 1907.

By the age of 18 years, he decided on a career in medicine, and with a science scholarship, studied at the London Hospital medical college from 1921 to 1928.
