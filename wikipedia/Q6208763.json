They are extensions of the term folklore, which was coined in 1846 by the English antiquarian William Thoms to describe \"the traditions, customs, and superstitions of the uncultured classes\".Percy Scholes, The Oxford Companion to Music, OUP 1977, article \"Folk Song\". The term further derives from the German expression volk, in the sense of \"the people as a whole\" as applied to popular and national music by Johann Gottfried Herder and the German Romantics over half a century earlier. Though it is understood that folk music is the music of the people, observers find a more precise definition to be elusive.The Never-Ending Revival by Michael F. Scully University of Illinois Press Urbana and Chicago 2008 Middleton, Richard, Studying Popular Music, Philadelphia: Open University Press (1990/2002). , p. 127. Some do not even agree that the term folk music should be used. Folk music may tend to have certain characteristics but it cannot clearly be differentiated in purely musical terms. One meaning often given is that of \"old songs, with no known composers,\"Ronald D. Cohen Folk music: the basics (CRC Press, 2006), pp. 1\u20132. another is that of music that has been submitted to an evolutionary \"process of oral transmission.... the fashioning and re-fashioning of the music by the community that give it its folk character.\"International Folk Music Council definition (1954/5), given in Lloyd (1969) and Scholes (1977)."]}, {"page": "Folklore", "response": ["The word folklore, a compound of folk and lore, was coined in 1846 by the Englishman William Thoms, who contrived the term as a replacement for the contemporary terminology of \"popular antiquities\" or \"popular literature\".

It is the knowledge and traditions of a particular group, frequently passed along by word of mouth.", "Verbal folklore was the original folklore, the artifacts defined by William Thoms as older, oral cultural traditions of the rural populace. In his 1846 published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of verbal lore. By the beginning of the 20th century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary. Antti Aarne published a first classification system for folktales in 1910. This was later expanded into the Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system by Stith Thompson and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. As the number of classified oral artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items that had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups and epochs, giving rise to the Historic\u2013Geographic Method, a methodology that dominated folkloristics in the first half of the 20th century.", "When William Thoms first published his appeal to document the verbal lore of the rural populations, it was believed these folk artifacts would die out as the population became literate. Over the past two centuries this belief has proven to be wrong; folklorists continue to collect verbal lore in both written and spoken form from all social groups. Some variants might have been captured in published collections, but much of it is still transmitted orally and indeed continues to be generated in new forms and variants at an alarming rate."]}, {"page": "Baronet", "response": ["A baronetcy is the only British hereditary honour that is not a peerage, with the exception of the Anglo-Irish Black Knights, White Knights and Green Knights (of whom only the Green Knights are extant).

Baronets are conventionally seen to belong to the lesser nobility, even though William Thoms claims that \"The precise quality of this dignity is not yet fully determined, some holding it to be the head of the nobiles minores, while others, again, rank Baronets as the lowest of the nobiles majores, because their honour, like that of the higher nobility, is both hereditary and created by patent.\"William J.

He fabricated it for use in an article published in the August 22, 1846 issue of The Athenaeum. Thoms consciously replaced the contemporary terminology of   \"popular antiquities\" or \"popular literature\" with this new word. Folklore was to  emphasize the study of a specific subset of the population: the rural, mostly illiterate peasantry. In his published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of older, mostly oral cultural traditions still flourishing among the rural populace. In Germany the Brothers Grimm had first published their \"Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen\" in 1812. They continued throughout their lives to collect German folk tales to include in their collection. In Scandinavia, intellectuals were also searching for their authentic Teutonic roots and had labeled their studies Folkeminde (Danish) or Folkermimne (Norwegian). Throughout Europe and America, other early collectors of folklore were at work. Thomas Crofton Croker published fairy tales from southern Ireland and, together with his wife, documented keening and other Irish funereal customs. Elias L\u00f6nnrot is best known for his collection of epic Finnish poems published under the title Kalevala.

Because age inflation often occurs in adulthood (to avoid military service or to apply for a pension early), or because the government may have begun record-keeping during an individual's lifetime, cases unverified by proximate records exist. These unverified cases are less likely to be true (because the records are written later), but are still possible. Longevity narratives were not subjected to rigorous scrutiny until the work of William Thoms in 1873. Thoms proposed the 100th-birthday test: is there evidence to support an individual's claimed age at what would be their centenary birthday? This test does not prove a person's age, but does winnow out typical pension-claim longevity exaggerations and spontaneous claims that a certain relative is over 150."]}, {"page": "The Folklore Society", "response": ["William Thoms, the editor of Notes and Queries who had first introduced the term folk-lore, seems to have been instrumental in the formation of the society and, along with G.

The word 'folklore' was first used by the English antiquarian William Thoms in a letter published in the London journal The Athenaeum in 1846. In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and mythology. Stith Thompson made a major attempt to index the motifs of both folklore and mythology, providing an outline into which new motifs can be placed, and scholars can keep track of all older motifs."]}, {"page": "William Thom", "response": ["* William Thoms, a British writer credited with coining the term \"folklore\" in 1846"]}, {"page": "House of Lords Library", "response": ["Leary died in 1861, and was succeeded as Librarian by barrister James Heard Pulman, who would occupy the office until 1897.

One of his Assistant Librarians, William Thoms, did show more initiative and during the 1860s collected a number of valuable historical works. Thoms was a lover of books and founded Notes and Queries, but his attempts to broaden the scope of the Library's collection were discouraged after a few years.
