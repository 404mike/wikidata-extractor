The song satirizes tennis champion John McEnroe who was notorious for his temper tantrums. It managed to reach number 19 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1982.'What becomes of the one-hit wonders?' \u2013 The Guardian Its B-side was a track named \"Moody Mole\" and the cover art was by illustrator Graham Humphreys.", "\"Chalk Dust \u2013 The Umpire Strikes Back\" is a satire of American tennis player John McEnroe and lampoons his infamous angry behaviour on the tennis court to a synthesizer beat. The entire song is a conversation between McEnroe (played by Roger Kitter) and the referee (played by Kaplan Kaye). They bicker and bicker until the referee finally loses his patience and just shoots McEnroe dead. The line \"The ball's in, everyone can see that the ball's in!\" was an actual quotation McEnroe  used to shout. As McEnroe dies in the song his final words are: \"I was talking to myself!\", which also a genuine excuse the real-life McEnroe used whenever a referee scolded him for being insulted."]}]}}
