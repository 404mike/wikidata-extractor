She specialised in detailed cut-paper work which adapted well to Wedgwood's jasperware with white bas relief scenes on coloured backgrounds. He first chose one of her designs in 1783, and his 1787 catalogue referred to her \"exquisite taste\" and \"charming groups\". Several of the designs Wedgwood used have a feminine or domestic theme.\nShe also painted in watercolours and sculpted in clay. Of particular note were her sculptures of family, including grandchildren.  A famous bust was made of her son-in-law the Marquess of Bristol. \nBorn in Herefordshire, she was the third daughter of  Shuckburgh Boughton and granddaughter of Sir William Boughton, 4th Baronet. She married Clotworthy Upton in 1769. Their family home was Castle Upton in Templepatrick, County Antrim, Ireland.  In 1776, her husband became Baron Templetown.\nLady Templetown stayed in Rome a lot towards the end of her life, dying in 1823. Her brother, Charles, was a Member of Parliament.\nHer children included:\n\nElizabeth Albana Upton, who married Frederick, 1st Marquess of Bristol", "link_mentions": {}}}
