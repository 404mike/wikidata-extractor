During the Peninsular War he became General Wellesley's second-in-command on two occasions. He fought at Vimeiro and testified in Wellesley's favour at the inquiry following the Convention of Cintra. He led a division at Bussaco and two divisions at Fuentes de Onoro. After the latter action, he had an independent command in northern Portugal. Wellesley, now Lord Wellington, was not satisfied that Spencer was up to the responsibilities of second-in-command and he was replaced by Thomas Graham. Miffed, Spencer left Portugal and never returned.

He briefly commanded this regiment in Portugal in early 1799, but was posted to the British military mission assisting the Russians in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in October. Soon after the invasion was called off and Walker evacuated with the rest of the army to the Channel Islands. Walker stayed with the Russians until they returned to their homeland in October 1800. He then re-joined the 50th, commanding them as a garrison unit at Malta from August 1801. The regiment moved in May 1802 to serve in Belfast, Ireland, where they assisted in putting down the Irish rebellion of 1803. Walker's next chance to see action did not come until 1807 when the regiment was sent to join a brigade commanded by Brigadier-General Brent Spencer. This brigade formed part of the army that attacked Copenhagen from August to September. The brigade was not broken up after the Copenhagen campaign, and instead sailed in December to attack naval installations at Cadiz and in the Mediterranean Sea. The transports the brigade travelled on were upset by constant bad weather as they travelled south, however, and they only reached Gibraltar in March 1808, by which time the opportunity to attack the installations had gone. Walker himself did not make Gibraltar at the same time as the rest of his regiment, as his ship had been separated from the rest of the convoy and driven all the way to Sicily, and he only learned of his regiment's landing at Gibraltar several weeks after the event, at which point he joined them."]}, {"page": "Battle of Bussaco order of battle", "response": ["\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maj Gen Brent Spencer"]}, {"page": "Battle of Fuentes de O\u00f1oro order of battle", "response": ["Column Commander: Lt Gen Brent Spencer, commanding 1st & 3rd Divisions", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lt Gen Brent Spencer"]}, {"page": "Douglas Mercer-Henderson", "response": ["In the Autumn of 1810 he went to Portugal and joined the army of Viscount Wellington following the Battle of Bussaco.

He was awarded the Decoration of The Lily by the French. By the British he was awarded the Army Gold Cross, (later) he was honoured with the Military General Service Medal.
