She provided a safe house for women who were released from prison where they could recover from hunger strikes under the \"Cat and Mouse Act\" without being watched by the police. She struck up a relationship with the editor of \"The Suffragette\", Rachel Barrett, and by mid 1913 was a useful \"sub-editor and bottle-washer\". She traveled with Annie and Jessie Kenney and Mary Richardson to spend a week in France with Christabel Pankhurst. Wylie and Barrett then traveled to Edinburgh to Wylie's aunt Jane, where Barrett had surgery and lived under a pseudonym to avoid re-arrest. Both returned to London for Christmas 1913, and continued to secretly edit The Suffragette until May 1914 when police again raided the premises in Lincoln's Inn. In 1917, Barrett and Wylie traveled to America.

In February 1908, she and her sister, Mary Gertrude Howey, were arrested alongside other WSPU members after hiding in a pantechnicon van that was driven into the House of Commons. After her release, she joined Annie Kenney and Mary Blathwayt to campaign at a by-election in Shropshire in May 1908. Soon afterwards, she was imprisoned again for three months for protesting outside the home of then-Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She was sentenced to six weeks in jail. Her demonstrations became more daring, including hiding overnight in the organ at Colston Hall, Bristol before Augustine Birrell, MP  was due to speak, assisted by Vera Holme inside and Minnie Baldock.    She went further on 5 September 1910, when Howey and two other suffragettes, Vera Wentworth and Jessie Kenney, assaulted Prime Minister Asquith and Herbert Gladstone while the men were playing golf, and pursued Asquith to his holiday home, left protest cards, saying 'Release Patricia Woodlock' and other suffragette materials in his private garden. Howey's violent tactics were criticised by some other members of the WSPU who called for her removal from the union. The actions proved too much for Mary Blathwayt's family. Her mother, Emily, resigned from the WSPU and her father, Linley, wrote letters of protest to Christabel Pankhurst, Howey and Wentworth.

This made headline news in the Daily Mirror, whose reporter had been alerted. Solomon and McClelland got a rousing cheer on joining the Caxton Hall event. After that meeting a delegation including Solomon tried again to approach the Prime Minister, while he was dining out, and twenty-seven women were arrested with leader Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. For Solomon and others like Constance Lytton, Caprina Fahey, Rose Lamartine Yates, and Sarah Carwin, this was their first arrest for activism.  International  attention was generated, with the Los Angeles Herald commenting on Solomon's and other protestor's 'high social position' and remarking that 'it is increasingly difficult to predict how their demands may be longer parried' and stating that the situation of these arrests and the perseverance of those fighting for the women's right to vote was becoming 'embarrassing' for the British government."]}, {"page": "Kitty Kenney", "response": ["Caroline \"Kitty\" Kenney (1880 \u2013 1952) was a sister of Annie Kenney, one of the most well-known British suffragettes to go on hunger strike,The Militant Suffrage Movement : Citizenship and Resistance in Britain, by Laura E.
