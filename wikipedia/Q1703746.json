The initial plan was that Auschwitz II would consist of four sectors (Bauabschnitte I\u2013IV), each consisting of six subcamps (BIIa\u2013BIIf) with their own gates and fences. The first two sectors were completed (sector BI was initially a quarantine camp), but the construction of BIII began in 1943 and stopped in April 1944, and the plan for BIV was abandoned.", "Measuring , the camp was larger than Auschwitz I. By the end of 1944, it housed 60 barracks measuring , each with a day room and a sleeping room containing 56 three-tiered wooden bunks. IG Farben paid the SS three or four Reichsmark for nine- to eleven-hour shifts from each worker. In 1943\u20131944, about 35,000 inmates worked at the plant; 23,000 (32 a day on average) were murdered through malnutrition, disease, and the workload. Within three to four months at the camp, Peter Hayes writes, the inmates were \"reduced to walking skeletons\". Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Auschwitz II reduced the population by nearly a fifth each month. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with the gas chambers, and the smell from the crematoria at Auschwitz I and II hung heavy over the camp."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Peter Hayes (born c. 1947), Holocaust"]}, {"page": "IG Farben", "response": ["Company executives said after the war that they had not known what was happening inside the camps.

One ton of Zyklon B was enough to kill around 312,500 people.", "Several IG Farben executives said after the war that they did not know about the gassings, despite the increase in sales of Zyklon B to Auschwitz. IG Farben owned 42.5 percent of Degesch shares, and three members of Degesch's 11-person executive board, Wilhelm Rudolf Mann, Heinrich H\u00f6rlein and Carl Wurster, were directors of IG Farben. Mann, who had been an SA-Sturmf\u00fchrer, was the chair of Degesch's board. Peter Hayes writes that the board did not meet after 1940, and that although Mann \"continued to review the monthly sales figures for Degesch, he could not necessarily have inferred from them the uses to which the Auschwitz camp was putting the product\".

Peter Hayes writes that the persecution of these groups was less uniform than that of the Jews. For example, the Nazis' treatment of the Slavs consisted of \"enslavement and gradual attrition\", while some Slavs were favored; Hayes lists Bulgarians, Croats, Slovaks, and some Ukrainians. In contrast, according to historian Dan Stone, Hitler regarded the Jews as \"a Gegenrasse: a 'counter-race'\u00a0... not really human at all\".", "Peter Hayes writes that the Germans created a \"Hobbesian world\" in Poland in which different parts of the population were pitted against each other. A perception among ethnic Poles that the Jews had supported the Soviet invasion contributed to existing antisemitism, which Germany exploited, redistributing Jewish homes and goods, and converting synagogues, schools and hospitals in Jewish areas into facilities for non-Jews. The Germans ordered the death penalty for anyone helping Jews. Informants pointed out who was Jewish and the Poles who were helping to hide them during the Judenjagd (hunt for the Jews). Despite the dangers, thousands of Poles helped Jews. Nearly 1,000 were executed for having done so, and Yad Vashem has named over 7,000 Poles as Righteous Among the Nations."]}, {"page": "Responsibility for the Holocaust", "response": ["Throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, Jews were subjected to antisemitism based on Christian theology, which blamed them for rejecting and killing Jesus. Numerous attempts were made by early Christians to convert the Jews to Christianity in the collective, but when they refused, this made them \"pariahs\" in the eyes of many Europeans. The consequences which they suffered for resisting conversion to Christianity were varied. An extensive series of attacks were committed against Jews as a result of the religious fervor which accompanied the First and Second Crusades (1095\u20131149). Jews were slaughtered in the wake of the Italian famine (1315\u20131317), attacked following the outbreak of the Black Death in the Rhineland in 1347, expelled from both England and Italy in the 1290s, from France in 1306 and 1394, from Spain and Portugal in 1492 and 1497.
