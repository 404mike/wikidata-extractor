Until Scott Redding's win at the 2008 125cc British Grand Prix, he was the only rider from the British Isles to win a race or pole in an FIM MotoGP World Championship class in the 2000s.\nBetween 1993 and 2001 McWilliams rode in the 500cc and 250cc classes. He took two podiums in the 500cc class in 2000, at the Italian GP and the British GP. The following year he won the 250cc race in the Netherlands aboard an Aprilia. This race, along with his 500cc podiums, is regarded as one of his career highlights.\nIn 2002 and 2003 McWilliams rode for Kenny Roberts' Team KR in MotoGP aboard the Proton KR bike. He took pole position at the 2002 Australian GP, and his best race result over these two years was 6th at the 2003 French GP.\nIn 2004 he rode an Aprilia in MotoGP, alongside Shane Byrne. His best finish was 12th place, which he achieved three times. In 2005 he rode in the British Superbike Championship on a Honda, but finished outside the top 10 in the end of year standings. That year he also competed in one MotoGP race, at Brno in the Czech Republic, but retired from the race.For 2007, he was to race in the MotoGP series for the Ilmor team, despite a heavy crash in testing in late 2006. He had to miss the first race of the season in Qatar, due to another crash, near the end of the Losail International Circuit. After this round the team suspended its racing operations and did not return.\nIn 2012, McWilliams participated in the North West 200 races, where he scored a second place in the Super-Twin event. Riding for the KMR Racing Team, McWilliams finished second behind his fellow Irishman, Ryan Farquhar.\nIn 2013, McWilliams had a supporting role in the film Under the Skin, starring Scarlett Johansson.In 2014 McWilliams returned to Grand Prix racing at the age of 50 for a one-off ride in the Moto2 series at Silverstone. He finished in 29th place aboard a Brough Superior bike designed by Paul Taylor.\nMcWilliams is involved in development work for motorcycle and tyre manufacturers, such as KTM, and also in coaching young riders through his Masterclass race schools.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Valentino Rossi", "response": ["It took nine races before Rossi won on the Honda, but his first 500cc victory came after a fierce battle with the Suzuki of Kenny Roberts Jr. and the Aprilia of Jeremy McWilliams.
