A scrappy game at Butts Park Arena resulted in a narrow 6\u20133 loss, but a spirited away victory over Rotherham and a nervy win against Coventry at Billesley Common by a score were enough to guarantee another season in the second tier. A terrible defensive display led to another defeat to Birmingham and Solihull, but fortunately it did not matter. However at the end of the season Moseley lost Aly Muldowney, who was the current Supporters' Player of the Season, to Glasgow Warriors, former Supporters' Player of the Season and England Sevens International James Rodwell, top points scorer Tristan Roberts to Championship rivals Doncaster, and released a number of players including the disappointing Justin Mensah-Coker."]}, {"page": "Rodwell", "response": ["* James Rodwell, English rugby union sevens player"]}, {"page": "Steve Evans (footballer, born 1962)", "response": ["An announcement was made on 20 February 2004 that Evans would return as Boston's manager on 2 March. In September 2005, Evans and four other people connected with Boston appeared in court, denying fraud charges. In November 2005, Evans was given a \u00a31,000 fine, suspended for a year, after admitting to using insulting or abusive words to the match official in a match against Peterborough United in October 2005. On 11 February 2006, he was escorted from Grimsby Town's stadium Blundell Park by Humberside Police at half-time, after he berated the fourth official after being incensed when Grimsby goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall appeared to handle the ball outside his area and was immediately spoken to by a police officer after a complaint of alleged foul and abusive language. After the match Boston chairman Jon Sotnick accused the football authorities of waging a \"conspiracy\" against his manager. In October 2006, Evans was linked with the vacant Darlington managerial vacancy, but Boston chairman James Rodwell and Evans both denied the link. Also in October, Evans was sent from the dugout after an altercation with Wycombe Wanderers player Tommy Doherty for which he later received a \u00a31,000 suspended fine from the FA. Despite this, which came on top of his conviction for tax evasion, Evans kept his manager's position at Boston, a decision that angered the Boston United Supporters' Trust."]}, {"page": "List of foreign Malaysian League players", "response": ["* James Rodwell \u2013 Sabah FA \u2013 1989"]}, {"page": "2010 Hong Kong Sevens", "response": ["|| 9= || James Rodwell  ||    || 5"]}, {"page": "England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["The squad consists of Dan Bibby, John Brake, Mark Bright, Phil Burgess, Mike Ellery, Charlie Hayter, Christian Lewis-Platt, Tom Mitchell (Captain), Dan Norton, Tom Powell, James Rodwell and Marcus Watson."]}, {"page": "List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners", "response": ["| (GBR)Mark BennettDan BibbyPhil BurgessSam CrossJames DaviesOllie Lindsay-HagueRuaridh McConnochieTom MitchellDan NortonMark RobertsonJames RodwellMarcus Watson"]}, {"page": "Rugby sevens at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament", "response": ["* James Rodwell", "* James Rodwell"]}, {"page": "James Rodwell (rugby union)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Rodwell"]}, {"page": "Rugby sevens at the 2018 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Richard de CarpentierMike ElleryPhil BurgessDan NortonJames RodwellTom MitchellDan BibbyAlex DavisOllie Lindsay-HagueRuaridh McConnochieEthan WaddletonHarry Glover"]}, {"page": "List of Commonwealth Games medallists in rugby sevens", "response": ["| Richard de CarpentierMike ElleryPhil BurgessDan NortonJames RodwellTom MitchellDan BibbyAlex DavisOllie Lindsay-HagueRuaridh McConnochieEthan WaddletonHarry Glover"]}, {"page": "England at the 2018 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["*James Rodwell"]}, {"page": "2017 Dubai Sevens", "response": ["|  Alamanda Motuga   James Rodwell   Kwagga Smith ||  Seabelo Senatla   Darcy Graham   Cecil Afrika   Joe Ravouvou"]}, {"page": "2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens squads \u2013 Men", "response": ["#James Rodwell"]}, {"page": "2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens squads \u2013 Men", "response": ["#James Rodwell"]}]}}
