He has appeared as a session musician on numerous albums by other artists, and has released his own albums as well. The Rout of the Blues (1971) was voted Melody Maker folk album of the year. His 1972 album for Polydor simply called Barry Dransfield was voted the rarest folk album in Record Hunter, worth approximately \u00a3400. Unlike most fiddlers (but like some Appalachian players) he is comfortable playing in the \"off the chest\" position, instead of under the chin.\nIn 1969 Barry and his brother Robin Dransfield were invited by Ashley Hutchings to join the group which would become Steeleye Span, but turned the offer down.\nTogether with his brother Robin, he was a member of a bluegrass/old-time band while still in his teens. Always innovative, he generally avoids electric instruments. The instrumental \"Blacksmith\", on Fiddler's Dream, is a complex set of variations in Romantic Paganini style, with no obvious relation to the song \"Blacksmith\", but ending with a double-tracked voice of Dransfield singing the opening line, \"Oh, A Blacksmith Courted Me\". Fiddler's Dream has been re-issued on Castle with many bonus tracks.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Bounty (1984 film)", "response": ["* Barry Dransfield as Michael Byrne"]}, {"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*Barry Dransfield"]}, {"page": "1984 in film", "response": ["| The Bounty || Orion Pictures Corporation / Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment || Roger Donaldson (director); Robert Bolt (screenplay); Mel Gibson, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Edward Fox, Daniel Day-Lewis, Bernard Hill, Philip Davis, Liam Neeson, Wi Kuki Kaa, Tevaite Vernette, Philip Martin Brown, Simon Chandler, Malcolm Terris, John Sessions, Andrew Wilde, Neil Morrissey, Richard Graham, Dexter Fletcher, Pete Lee-Wilson, Jon Gadsby, Barry Dransfield, Steve Fletcher, Jack May || History, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Richard Thompson (musician)", "response": ["In April 1972, he released his first solo album Henry the Human Fly, recording with Sandy Denny, Pat Donaldson, Sue Draheim, John Kirkpatrick, Barry Dransfield, Ashley Hutchings, Linda Peters, Andy Roberts, and others.

In October he was able to fill the Royal Festival Hall. In 1972 Robin and Barry Dransfield's \u201cLord of all I Behold\u201d was Melody Maker's Folk Album of the Year. Jo eagerly read the pop press and signed them up, even before the album was released. The two brothers were then signed to Warner Brothers in America, and were off on a big concert tour supporting another Lustig act, Ralph McTell. Unfortunately the brothers not only quarrelled with each other but Barry seemed to be psychologically unable to handle large-scale commercial fame. Jo tore up the contract in disgust. This gives a hint of how impatient and short-tempered Jo Lustig was. By the end of the 1972 McTell had also broken with Jo Lustig. Ralph's brother Bruce was in charge again. It is perhaps surprising that Jo never managed Donovan, the biggest of all British folk artists. The reason is that Mickie Most got there first, and managed Donovan well. Another casualty of Jo's aggressive publicity-seeking approach was Anne Briggs, who was so disgusted that she gave up singing altogether, citing Jo as one of the reasons. Shel Talmy described him as \u201cone of my most unfavourite people\u201d."]}, {"page": "The Albion Band", "response": ["* Barry Dransfield - violin, dulcimer, vocals (1971, 1979)"]}, {"page": "Henry the Human Fly", "response": ["*Barry Dransfield  \u2013 fiddle (3,5,6)"]}, {"page": "No Roses", "response": ["#* Shirley Collins \u2013 lead vocals; Nic Jones \u2013 backing vocals and fiddle; Ashley Hutchings \u2013 bass guitar; Richard Thompson \u2013 electric guitar; Simon Nicol \u2013 electric guitar; Tim Renwick \u2013 electric guitar; Dave Mattacks \u2013 drums; Barry Dransfield \u2013 fiddle; Francis Baines \u2013 hurdy gurdy", "*Barry Dransfield"]}, {"page": "Bill Leader", "response": ["*The Lark In the Morning (1969) Dave and Toni Arthur with Barry Dransfield"]}, {"page": "List of fiddlers", "response": ["| Barry Dransfield||English||English, folk"]}, {"page": "Morris On", "response": ["Morris On is a folk/rock album released in 1972 under the joint names of Ashley Hutchings, Richard Thompson, Dave Mattacks, John Kirkpatrick and Barry Dransfield.
