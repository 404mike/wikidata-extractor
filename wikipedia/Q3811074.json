Her mother was Henriette Malan, the daughter of a Swiss clergyman. She went to Abbot Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts, and was in the class of 1867.After her parents' divorce, Julia went to live with her mother in Venice. Henriette had remarried, her second husband being a painter, Eugene Benson. Julia also spent some time in London. One of the sponsors of her early novels was Alfred Sassoon, a junior member of the wealthy Sassoon family and the father of Siegfried Sassoon. Alfred's infatuation with Julia was the catalyst for his desertion of his wife, Theresa. Julia's other supporters included her grandfather's friend Henry James, and she also knew Rudyard Kipling, Robert Browning and Walter Pater.Two of her books, Kismet and Mirage, were published as \"no name novels\" by Roberts Brothers in Boston.  Both books deal with Americans' adventures while traveling abroad, along the Nile and in Syria, respectively.  Mirage has been described by Oscar Wilde scholar S. I. Salamensky, as a roman-\u00e1-clef fiction in which \"a dangerously appealing, if slightly bi- or asexual, figure based on Wilde romantically pursues\" a woman who is thought to represent Fletcher.In 1900 she wrote a translation/adaptation of Edmond Rostand's play Les Romanesques, which she titled The Fantasticks.  The 1960 musical of the same name, also based on Les Romanesques, borrows heavily from Fletcher's version.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andromeda (mythology)", "response": ["* Julia Constance Fletcher (who wrote under the pseudonym George Fleming), Andromeda, a Novel (1885)"]}, {"page": "Abbot Academy", "response": ["* Julia Constance Fletcher - (1867)"]}, {"page": "James Cooley Fletcher", "response": ["He went back to the USA in 1854, shortly after his daughter Julia Constance Fletcher was born."]}, {"page": "George Fleming", "response": ["* Julia Constance Fletcher or George Fleming (1853\u20131938), American writer"]}, {"page": "Theresa Thornycroft", "response": ["In 1890, Alfred left Theresa, apparently infatuated with the American writer, Julia Constance Fletcher; he continued to see the children occasionally until his death, aged 33, in 1895, in East Sussex, from tuberculosis,General Register Office: registers of deaths in the Eastbourne district, vol. 2b, page 48http://www.thepeerage.com/p20473.htm#i204721 Beatrice Potter, \"re: Lady Isabella Somerset,\" message to Darryl Roger Lundy, 30 November 2005.
