Howson's \"misguided self-assurance\" was said to have contributed to the company's collapse.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carillion", "response": ["On 10 July 2017, a Carillion trading update highlighted a \u00a3845\u00a0million impairment charge in its construction services division, mainly relating to three loss-making UK PFI projects and costs arising from Middle East projects. Chief executive Richard Howson (appointed CEO in December 2011) stepped down but was retained as operations director, with Keith Cochrane temporarily becoming CEO (Carillion's search for a new CEO led to the appointment of Andrew Davies, CEO of Wates \u2013 announced on 27 October 2017 \u2013 with Davies set to join the firm in April 2018).", "On 6 August 2018, the Insolvency Service announced the end of the trading phase of the liquidation, described by the Official Receiver as \"the largest ever trading liquidation in the UK\". Work on finalising Carillion's trading accounts and payments to suppliers, and investigations into the cause of the company's failure, including the conduct of its directors, continued. In December 2018, it was reported that former Carillion directors Philip Green and Richard Howson had been interviewed by the Insolvency Service. In November 2019, the liquidators said they were reportedly close to clawing back around \u00a3510m from asset sales, insurance and debt recoveries.", "In 6 February hearings, Carillion directors blamed the company's collapse on problem contracts (including two hospital PFI projects \u2013 in Liverpool and Birmingham \u2013 with cost overruns), high levels of debt arising from the 2011 acquisition of Eaga, plus Brexit, the 2017 General Election and interest rates. The company also claimed it was owed \u00a3200m in relation to the Msheireb Downtown Doha project in Qatar \u2013 former CEO Richard Howson said he felt like \"a bailiff\" in chasing the debt. (Carillion's claim was subsequently disputed by Msheireb Properties, with the Qataris prepared to testify to the select committees, providing written evidence to them, and said to be considering a \u00a3200m claim against Carillion.) MPs on the two select committees also discussed documents showing that Carillion investor Standard Life had expressed concerns over the company's financial management, strategy and corporate governance in 2015. After the session, committee chairs Frank Field and Rachel Reeves said:", "Interviewed by the joint Business and Work and Pensions Committee on 7 March 2018, key Carillion investors Aberdeen Standard Investments, Kiltearn and Blackrock said the board focused more on their own pay than the company's performance, and questioned KPMG's auditing of the 2016 accounts. The protection of directors' pay extended to the creation of a secret bank account for former CEO Richard Howson's share-related bonuses.", "The report said Carillion's collapse had significant consequences, citing: over 2,000 job losses; a pension liability of around \u00a32.6 billion reducing payments to 27,000 pension scheme members; debts owed to 30,000 suppliers, sub-contractors and other creditors; and \u00a3150m in UK Government expenditure to keep essential public services running. Former directors Philip Green, Richard Adam and Richard Howson were singled out for particular criticism. The select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for a complete overhaul of Britain's corporate governance regime, saying the government had \"lacked the decisiveness or bravery\" to do so, and accused the big four accounting firms of operating as a \"cosy club\", with KPMG singled out for its \"complicity\" in signing off Carillion's \"increasingly fantastical figures\" and internal auditor Deloitte accused of failing to identify, or ignoring, \"terminal failings\". The report recommended the Government refer the statutory audit market to the Competition and Markets Authority, urging consideration of breaking up the Big Four, while two regulators, the Financial Reporting Council and The Pensions Regulator, were branded as \"chronically passive\".", "In June 2018, it was reported that KPMG and Carillion bosses had maintained a \u00a3329m valuation of goodwill relating to the former Eaga business (later Carillion Energy Services), despite huge losses. Ignoring the impairment meant they could continue to pay dividends and directors' bonuses, including \u00a31.8m each paid to Richard Howson and Richard Adam.", "In addition to its initial investigation into the timeliness and content of Carillion's financial announcements, the Financial Conduct Authority said its investigation would extend to allegations of insider trading in Carillion shares prior to its trading update on 10 July 2017. In November 2020, the FCA said some Carillion directors had \"acted recklessly\" and released \"misleadingly positive\" market updates before it collapsed, singling out updates issued on 7 December 2016, 1 March 2017 and 3 May 2017. As a result, the FCA said it had sent notices to some (unnamed) former Carillion directors warning of possible enforcement action (possible sanctions include public censure, fines and suspensions from holding certain positions). In January 2021, the Insolvency Service said it would seek to ban eight former Carillion directors from holding senior boardroom positions, namely: Philip Green, Richard Howson, Keith Cochrane, Richard Adam and Zafar Khan, and non-executive directors Andrew Dougal, Alison Horner and Ceri Powell.", "*One-time CEO Richard Howson (appointed December 2009, resigned 10 July 2017)*\u2020"]}, {"page": "Settle College", "response": ["* Richard Howson, businessman"]}, {"page": "Keith Cochrane", "response": ["Cochrane was appointed to the board of Carillion plc on 2 July 2015 and on 10 July 2017 he became its Interim Chief Executive, taking over from Richard Howson.
