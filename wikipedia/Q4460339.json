The Oral History journal, founded by Paul Thompson, has echoed these interests and many more in the articles it has published.

One of the first of these projects was City Lives, which also began in 1988.  It was led by Paul Thompson (with particularly important help from Sir Nicholas Goodison) and later by Cathy Courtney.  City Lives was funded entirely from within the City, mostly from smaller donations, but including an especially important grant from the Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation.  This project resulted in a unique collection of nearly 150 in-depth interviews of the financial elite of the City of London.  The project culminated in an exhibition of memorabilia and photographic portraits of City interviewees at the Bank of England Museum, and in the publication of the book City Lives: The Changing Voices of British Finance (Methuen, 1996, ), edited by Cathy Courtney with an introduction by Paul Thompson.

Using case studies of middle-class family and business relationships in urban Birmingham and rural East Anglia, Davidoff and Hall traced the evolution of capitalist enterprise in England at the end of the 18th century. They demonstrated the gendered division of labour through an examination of the family, the economy and religious belief: in particular, the way men operated in the public sphere, and women, in the private, domestic sphere.
