The studios promoted a fictitious persona for Bara as an Egyptian-born woman interested in the occult. Bara made more than 40 films between 1914 and 1926, but most are now lost, having perished in the 1937 Fox vault fire.

Just before she boarded the train for Hollywood, Brabin gave her some advice: \"Don't think of supporting Mix in that play. Don't play in program pictures. Never play anything but specials. Mr. Fox is about to put on Monte Cristo. You should play the part of Mercedes.

The production troubles were numerous, and due to political troubles engulfing Italy at the time, resulted in disputes and delayed permissions.
