Bradley, 2004 Des Dillon wrote about the notion of a separate Coatbridge accent influenced by the successive waves of Irish immigrants into the town. The Coatbridge accent has been categorised as generally less usage of the Scots tongue and the tendency to stress the 'a' vowel differently, e.g. stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) etc. and this is attributed to the impact of successive influxes of Irish immigrants, particularly from Ulster. Another notable language trait reminiscent of Hiberno-English that is practiced commonly in Coatbridge is the use of the 'reaffirmative' after a sentence, e.g. \"I need to go up the street tomorrow so I do,\" or \"Tommy Tango's is always open so it is\". This use of the re-affirmative is still common although, due to intermingling of the population, the Coatbridge accent is no longer so distinct from the neighbouring Glasgow accent.", "* Monks - Des Dillon"]}, {"page": "Graham Fulton", "response": ["* Blissed-out for 5: New Writing   (with David Crystal, Des Dillon, Ally May and Shug Hanlan) (Neruda Press), 1997 "]}, {"page": "Kirsty Williams (drama)", "response": ["| Des Dillon"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish poets", "response": ["*Des Dillon"]}, {"page": "Scott Kyle", "response": ["In 2010, Kyle's had a starring role in Des Dillon's play Singin' I'm No A Billy He's A Tim, which focused on the rivalry between Old Firm (Rangers and Celtic) football fans.
