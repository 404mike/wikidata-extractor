Rent strikes spread from heavily industrialised areas of the city to artisanal areas and slum areas. Strikes ignited in Partick, Parkhead, Pollokshaws, Pollok, Cowcaddens, Kelvingrove, Ibrox, Govanhill, St Rollox, Townhead, Springburn, Maryhill, Fairfield, Blackfriars, and Woodside. In October 1915, 15,000 tenants were on rent strike and a demonstration led by women converged on St Enoch Square. By November, 20,000 tenants were on rent strike as violent resistance against evictions continued. Trade unions threatened factory strikes if evictions supported by the police continued and following demonstrations on 17 November, legal action against rent strikers was halted. State Secretary of Scotland McKinnon Wood asked the Cabinet to freeze all rents at pre-war levels and in December, the Rents and Mortgage Interest Restriction Act 1915 received royal assent."]}, {"page": "London County Council", "response": ["|McKinnon Wood||(10 March 1898 \u2013 8 March 1907)||9"]}, {"page": "Royal Arsenal", "response": ["In 1919 a committee was set up, under the chairmanship of McKinnon Wood, to report on the future organisation and role of the Royal Arsenal.

While he did not believe there was any serious attempt to injure him, in trying to escape he twisted his knee and \"slipped the knee-cap\". C. P. Scott wrote in his diary that Birrell feared he might require an operation to remove his knee-cap and joked that, if he did, he would remain 'a weak-kneed politician' to the end of his life. Birrell was, however, described by the paper Votes for Women as one of a number of \"Suffragist members of the Cabinet\" who met with a deputation from the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), led by Millicent Fawcett, on 8 August 1913, following a similar meeting by the NUWSS with Prime Minister Asquith on the same day.
