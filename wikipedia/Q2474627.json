Hetfield and Ulrich went through the tapes and selected the strongest riffs to assemble into songs. Instruments were recorded separately, with only Hetfield playing rhythm guitar. Rasmussen, with the support of drum roadie Flemming Larsen, taught the basics of timing and beat duration to Ulrich, who had a tendency to increase speed and had little knowledge of rhythm theory. Drums were recorded in an empty warehouse at the back of the studio, which was not soundproof, and caused reverberation. Although four tracks were already arranged, the band members were not used to creating songs in the studio, as they had not done so for Kill 'Em All. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", \"Trapped Under Ice\", and \"Escape\" were written mostly in Copenhagen, and the band put finishing touches on \"Fight Fire with Fire\", \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Creeping Death\", and \"The Call of Ktulu\", which had already been performed live. Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett took the album's name from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. The cover art, displaying an electric chair in the midst of lightning bolts, was conceived before recording began. Metallica initially had sound problems, because its gear was stolen three weeks before the band arrived in Copenhagen. The band members slept in the studio by day as they could not afford a hotel and recorded by night, because the studio was booked by other artists during the daytime. Because the group was looking for a major label deal, several A&R representatives from different labels visited the studio. At first, it seemed that Metallica was going to sign with Bronze Records, but the deal was canceled, because Bronze executive Gerry Bron did not appreciate the work done at Sweet Silence Studios, and wanted the US edition to be remixed by engineer Eddie Kramer, and even considered re-recording the album in another studio. Metallica was put off by Bron's failure to share the band's artistic vision and decided to look for another label for the US release, though Bronze had already advertised Metallica as one of its bands."]}, {"page": "Eleanor Bron", "response": ["Bron was born on 14 March 1938 in Stanmore, Middlesex, into a Jewish family.

Her elder brother was the record producer Gerry Bron."]}, {"page": "Vivian Stanshall", "response": ["According to their manager/agent Gerry Bron, after a perhaps ill-advised agreement that the band should be left to their own artistic devices, Stanshall was allowed several weeks in a hired rehearsal space to write songs for the new Bonzo Dog Band album. When Bron arrived at the location to check the progress of these endeavours, he found that Stanshall had not written anything at all and had instead built a variety of hutches for his pet rabbits.Originals \u2013 Vivian Stanshall: The Canyons of His Mind, BBC/October Films, BBC4, 2004 Bron mentioned in a television documentary that this occurred in May 1968 in a hall in Acton, West London. The actual location is Askew Road Church Hall, at the start of Bassein Park Road in Shepherd's Bush. The date would suggest that these were rehearsals for the album The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse. During recordings for the album proper at Morgan Studios, Stanshall, wearing just a rabbit's head and underpants, interviewed members of the public in Willesden High Road. On the album track \"We Are Normal\", one interviewee can be heard to remark, 'He's got a head on him like a rabbit.'"]}, {"page": "Uriah Heep (band)", "response": ["Spice avoided playing covers and, according to Box, always strove \"...to do something original.\" Managed initially by Newton's father, the band climbed their way up to The Marquee level, then got signed by Gerry Bron (the Hit Record Productions Ltd.'s boss) who saw the band at the Blues Loft club in High Wycombe. \"I thought they were a band I could develop and I took them on that basis,\" remembered Bron later. He became the band's manager and signed them to Vertigo Records, the newly formed Philips label. The four-piece found themselves booked into the Lansdowne Studios in London, still under the name of Spice. Then the name was changed to that of the well-known character from David Copperfield, Uriah Heep (for, according to biographer Kirk Blows, \"Dickens' name being everywhere around Christmas '69 due to it being the hundredth anniversary of his death\"). According to Dave Ling's 2001 autobiography of the band, Wizards and Demons, The Uriah Heep Story, though the \"Uriah Heep\" moniker was chosen in December 1969, the band continued to play gigs as \"Spice\" until Ken Hensley joined in February 1970. Uriah Heep then decided to widen the sound. \"We'd actually recorded half the first album when we decided that keyboards would be good for our sound. I was a big Vanilla Fudge fan, with their Hammond organ and searing guitar on top, and we had David's high vibrato vocals anyway so that's how we decided to shape it,\" Box recalled. Gerry Bron brought in session player Colin Wood, followed by Hensley, a former colleague of Newton in the Gods, who was then playing guitar in Toe Fat. \"I saw a lot of potential in the group to do something very different,\" remembered Hensley.", "When Nigel Olsson returned to Elton John's group in the spring of 1970, Keith Baker took his place. The band's second album, Salisbury (February 1971), was more squarely in the progressive rock genre, with its 16-minute title track featuring a 24-piece orchestra. One of the album's tracks, \"Lady in Black\", described by Donald A. Guarisco as \"...a stylishly arranged tune that builds from a folk-styled acoustic tune into a throbbing rocker full of ghostly harmonies and crunching guitar riffs,\" became a hit in Germany upon its re-release in 1977 (earning the band the Radio Luxemburg Lion award). Produced by Gerry Bron, the second album was significant for Ken Hensley's rise to the position of main songwriter.", "By this time, Gerry Bron's deal with Philips/Vertigo was over, so he set up his own label, Bronze Records. The third album was recorded in the summer months of 1971, during the band's three visits to Lansdowne. \"It was the point in time when the band really found a solid musical direction,\" said Bron later. The third album, Look at Yourself, released in October 1971, marked the solidification of disparate ideas that had been a prominent feature of Salisbury and presented the unified sound and direction. \"July Morning\" has often been cited as the standout track. \"I think that 'July Morning' is one of the best examples of the way the band was developing at that point in time. It introduced a lot of dynamics, a lot of light and shade into our sound,\" Ken Hensley said. The album peaked at No. 39 in the UK.", "By the end of 1971 it became clear, according to Hensley, that he, Byron and Box had become the tightly knit nucleus of the band. Feeling marginalised and having recently been badly shaken up when he was involved in an accident in Germany in one of the band's cars, first bassist Paul Newton left, in November of '71, and was briefly replaced by Mark Clarke. Newton recalled in a 2000 interview on Uriah Heep's website his departure: \"Well, as you know, my father managed the band in the early days, with the Gods and Spice. He bought a lot of the gear and so on. When we became Uriah Heep and Ken joined the band \u2013 and Ken is the first to admit it \u2013 he had very definite ideas about what he wanted to do in a band. I suppose in some ways it was like the band was a vehicle which Ken needed and used to put his own ideas together. And there's nothing wrong with that as such. I mean, let's face it, the fact that what we did was successful was great for me too. But after a while you're bound to get some in-fighting in a situation like that. There were other problems too, because Gerry Bron was now the manager and my father was trying to get back some money from him - get some of his money back on the equipment and so on. There was a lot of unhappiness on all sorts of levels and everybody was unhappy in a lot of ways. I actually wanted to leave the band for quite a while before I actually left but I didn't. Anyway, with the heavy work schedules and the pressures and so on, I ended up collapsing on stage one night and the other members of the band decided I should go. It was funny because I didn't want to go and there was a lot of animosity but at the same time it was a tremendous relief\".", "Wonderworld (June 1974), recorded in Munich's Musicland Studios in January, disappointed fans and band members alike. \"Recording abroad disrupted the band's normal method of operation and that had a big negative effect on the group. Our communication was falling apart, we were arguing over stuff like royalties and we were getting involved in matters beyond music,\" Hensley said. Box remembered weeks spent in the studio as \"dramatic\" for all the wrong reasons. \"David was drunk for most of the time, Kenny was having an emotional time of it and I was constantly trying to help them so it was difficult for me too. There was also a little bit of friction because (artistic) Kenny didn't like all the attention that (flamboyant) David was getting.\" Gary Thain was in even more serious trouble. According to Blows, \"A strenuous touring schedule, compounded by the bassist's heavy drug dependency (inherent even before joining Heep) was taking its toll, though matters came to a head while on tour during September,\" when the bassist received a serious electric shock on stage in Dallas during a gig at Southern Methodist University\u2019s Moody Coliseum on 15 September 1974. The rest of the US tour was then canceled and their UK dates rescheduled to October. Soon after going out of hospital, Thain, in Sounds, openly accused manager Gerry Bron of having turned Uriah Heep into a mere \"financial thing\" and was fired two months after the group's final gig of 1974 at New Theatre in Oxford, England on 14 December. A year later, on 8 December 1975, Gary Thain was found dead in his Norwood Green home, having overdosed on heroin.", "A meeting at the manager's office concerning the songwriting dissent was the last straw and, in September 1980, Hensley quit. Gregg Dechert, a Canadian who had worked with Sloman in Pulsar, came in and the band went on a 23-date tour of the UK. After that Sloman left, citing musical differences for a reason. He would later go on to work with UFO, Gary Moore and Robert Palmer. Hensley's acrimonious departure left the group in a state of collapse. Box and Bolder visited David Byron with attractive propositions. \"We couldn't believe it when he said he didn't want to know,\" the guitarist remembered. Bolder, who by that time, \"...had had enough of Gerry Bron and the management,\" decided to join Wishbone Ash. When Dechert left, Uriah Heep were down to just Mick Box with the name and contract.", "By this time Gerry Bron was Uriah Heep manager no longer (they were looked after by Neil Warnock in Europe and Blue Oyster Cult's management team in the US) and then, finally, Bronze Records collapsed under the weight of debts, which, according to Box, \"...cost Heep a lot of money.\" Massive Asian and South American tours followed before the band returned to the studio with producer Tony Platt and a new deal with CBS's Portrait label secured by new manager Harry Maloney. Meanwhile, David Byron died of a heart attack and liver disease on 28 February 1985 at the age of 38."]}, {"page": "Levitation (Hawkwind album)", "response": ["The band also undertook an additional eleven date tour of Britain between 12 and 22 December, with support from Leamington Spa NWOBHM group Chevy, the Lewisham Odeon concert on the 18 being professionally recorded. Brock pressed Bronze Records to release another live album from these tapes, but having just issued Live Seventy Nine, label head Gerry Bron declined stating of Hawkwind that \"they were a bit lazy, they constantly wanted to do live albums, so they wouldn't have to write songs\". The recordings were later issued on the albums Zones (1983), This Is Hawkwind, Do Not Panic (1984) and Hawkwind Anthology.

With Uriah Heep, Hensley found a place to develop and showcase his songwriting and lyrical abilities as well as his keyboard and guitar playing. The band's \"classic\" line-up featured Hensley, Byron, Box, Kerslake and bassist Gary Thain, plus the management provided by Gerry Bron (Bronze Records). During his time with Heep (1970\u20131980), they recorded 13 studio albums, and the live album Uriah Heep Live \u2013 January 1973 along with many compilations and singles.

Tracey threatened legal action for breach of contract and the band had to be bought out of the agreement.", "Although The Bonzos had started out playing and parodying trad jazz and 1920s-style popular music, by 1967 they were contemplating embracing a more contemporary style of rock music, in order to counter claims that they sounded too much like The Temperance Seven or the fictional, studio-concocted New Vaudeville Band. In fact although they were now exclusively managed by Gerry Bron, The Bonzos were invited to perform live as the New Vaudeville Band in order to capitalise on the fictional group's recent chart success with \"Winchester Cathedral\"\u2014an offer The Bonzos immediately declined in favour of retaining their own artistic control.Richie Unterberger (2000) \"Urban Spacemen and Wayfaring Strangers\" 109\u2013121(San Francisco: Miller Freeman)  However, Bob Kerr happily agreed to help form a real New Vaudeville Band, allegedly taking the bulk of his former bandmates' stage act with him, a move which finally forced The Bonzos' hand over the change of direction (Kerr later went on to create his own long-standing early Bonzos/Vaudevilles-style band, Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band, which included other ex-Bonzos Sam Spoons and Vernon Bowhay-Nowell in its future line-ups). According to Neil Innes, The Bonzos had learned a salutary lesson about the pitfalls of show business: ", "After signing with the US-based Liberty Records label, the Bonzos released their first album, Gorilla (1967), produced by Gerry Bron. The LP included \"Jazz: Delicious Hot, Disgusting Cold\" which parodied their early \"trad\" jazz roots and featured deliberately inept jazz playing. The record label had allowed them two hours of studio time per track, so \"Jazz\" was completed in a single take to allow more time for the far more complex \"The Intro and the Outro\". In this number every member of the band was introduced and played a solo, starting with the genuine band members before including such improbable guest musicians as John Wayne on xylophone, Adolf Hitler on vibes, J. Arthur Rank on gong, Prime Minister Harold Wilson on violin, the Wild Man of Borneo, Val Doonican, Horace Batchelor, and Lord Snooty and His Pals. The music was based on an excerpt from Duke Ellington's \"C Jam Blues\".", "By the end of 1968, The Bonzos wanted to be successful in the US. Their manager Gerry Bron, however, thought they should be consolidating their success in England before rushing off to conquer The States, and this difference of opinion led to a parting of the ways (although the two parties amicably retained their publishing and agency deals). The band had recently been courted by Tony Stratton-Smith who was more sympathetic to their desire to crack America and promised to deliver what they wanted, and by Christmas he was their new manager.", "As 1969 began, it seemed that American success was on the horizon for The Bonzos. In April Stratton-Smith secured them the support slot on a high-profile tour of the U.S. with The Who, and some appearances at the Fillmore East with The Kinks as well as a string of club dates. Gerry Bron's misgivings were revealed to be well-founded, however, when Stratton-Smith proved to be out of his depth, and The Bonzos' first American sojourn was so badly-organised and promoted that the promised 'tour' ended up amounting to little more than the Fillmore appearances and a few scattered low-profile club dates, with much twiddling of thumbs in between. The Bonzos' act had been well received by the few audiences who witnessed it, but it was far from the triumphant adventure they had expected.
