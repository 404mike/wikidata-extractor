Described by Peter Quennell as \"One of the most remarkable books of its kind ever published in the English Language\", Hickey's Memoirs give an extraordinarily vivid picture of life in late 18th-century London, Calcutta, Madras and Jamaica which stands comparison with the best of his near-contemporary James Boswell.", "link_mentions": {}}}
