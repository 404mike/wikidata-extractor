Described by Peter Quennell as \"One of the most remarkable books of its kind ever published in the English Language\", Hickey's Memoirs give an extraordinarily vivid picture of life in late 18th-century London, Calcutta, Madras and Jamaica which stands comparison with the best of his near-contemporary James Boswell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hookah", "response": ["In the Indian subcontinent, the Hindustani word huqqa (Devanagari: \u0939\u0941\u0915\u093c\u094d\u0915\u093c\u093e, Nastaleeq: ) is used and is the origin of the English word \"hookah\". The widespread use of the Indian word \"hookah\" in the English language is a result of the colonization in British India (1858\u20131947), when large numbers of expatriate Britons first sampled the water pipe.

In 1764 he had been appointed collector of Burdwan in place of Warren Hastings, which resulted in a long-standing enmity between the two men. In 1775, when Hastings was Governor-General, Nanda Kumar brought accusations of corruption against him, accusing him of accepting bribes and other abuses of power. These were taken up with enthusiasm by Hastings' rivals on the Governor General's Council, led by Philip Francis. Whilst this matter was still awaiting investigation Nanda Kumar was indicted for forgery of a deed, condemned and executed. There was a strong suspicion that the charges had been invented by Hastings, and that he had put pressure on the judges to pass sentence of death. At this date it was far from clear whether or not English law applied in Calcutta, and it was extremely rare for the death penalty to be applied for forgery even in England. Furthermore, Nanda Kumar was a Brahman, and his hanging caused widespread dismay and outrage in Calcutta.The Memoirs of William Hickey (London: Hurst & Blackett) Vol.II (1918) pp154-5", "In 1772, Calcutta became the capital of British India, a decision made by Governor General Warren Hastings.

In early 1778 she arrived in Calcutta to find work as a miniaturist, her arrival noted in his memoirs by William Hickey. She produced a number of miniatures of British subjects while in that city, including a portrait of Hickey. It was in Calcutta that after her conversion she married, in 1779, Alexander Higginson, a member of the East India Company from an old military family; her baptismal record describes her as \"a Person of riper Years\". It appears that she ceased her artistic pursuits upon her marriage. The couple returned wealthy to England in 1782, but poor investments led their fortune to be greatly diminished by the time of Higginson's death in 1793. they had three sons, including Charles Harwood Higginson (1784\u20131824), a judge in the Supreme Court of Calcutta; Alexander (1786\u20131855) and George Powell Higginson (1788\u20131866) both served in the Grenadier Guards.
