He is young, hungry, has real pace and he's keen to learn\". A day later, he played in Alan Main's testimonial match, against a Manchester United XI. Haber made his competitive debut for the club in a 1\u20131 draw against Hearts on August 14, 2010, playing the opening 72 minutes of the match. He scored his first goal for the club on September 21, 2010, as he ran onto Alan Maybury's pass to score as St Johnstone beat Queen of the South 3\u20130 in the Scottish League Cup. After making 14 appearances, and scoring twice, during the first three months of the season, Haber snapped his anterior cruciate ligament in a 3\u20130 home defeat to Kilmarnock on November 6, 2010, turning \"awkwardly on the slick McDiarmid Park surface\" in \"an innocuous incident\".
