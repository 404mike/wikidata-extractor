Indeed, it had not even been orchestrated when he died in 2010, and his son Miko\u0142aj completed it after his death from the piano score and notes left behind by his father.Adrian Thomas, notes to Nonesuch Records' 2016 recording of the symphony, 7559-79503-4 It uses similar repetition techniques as the Second and Third Symphonies, but to very different effect; for example, its opening consists of a series of very loud, repeated cells that together spell out the name of the composer Alexandre Tansman via a musical cryptogram, punctuated with heavy strokes on the bass drum and clashing bitonality between the chords of A and E-flat.Thomas, 2016", "During the last decade of his life, G\u00f3recki suffered from frequent illnesses. His Symphony No. 4 (op. 85, 2006) was due to be premiered in London in 2010 by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, but the event was cancelled due to the composer's ill health.Southbank Centre. Retrieved on 5 February 2010.) He died on 12 November 2010, in his home city of Katowice, from complications arising from a lung infection.  Reacting to his death, the head of the Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music, Professor Eugeniusz Knapik, said \"G\u00f3recki's work is like a huge boulder that lies in our path and forces us to make a spiritual and emotional effort\". Adrian Thomas, Professor of Music at Cardiff University, said, \"The strength and startling originality of G\u00f3recki's character shone through his music [...] Yet he was an intensely private man, sometimes impossible, with a strong belief in family, a great sense of humour, a physical courage in the face of unrelenting illness, and a capacity for firm friendship\". He was married to Jadwiga, a piano teacher. His daughter, Anna G\u00f3recka-Stanczyk, is a pianist, and his son, Miko\u0142aj G\u00f3recki, is a composer. He was survived by five grandchildren."]}, {"page": "Andrzej Panufnik", "response": ["His Nocturne was singled out for criticism, and later General W\u0142odzimierz Sokorski, Secretary of Culture, announced that Panufnik's Sinfonia Rustica had \"ceased to exist\". Panufnik later described the symphony as \"a patently innocent work\", and he found it particularly galling that one of the panel that decided on the work's proscription had earlier been on the panel that had awarded it first prize in the Chopin Composition Competition. The work was nevertheless published by the State Publishing House and, as Adrian Thomas has shown, performances of the work continued sporadically in Poland.  While his compositions were branded at home as formalist, Panufnik was promoted abroad as a cultural export, both as composer and conductor.  The authorities awarded him their highest accolade, Standard of Labour First Class.", "Bernard Jacobson described the events of Panufnik's escape from Poland as being straight out of a John le Carr\u00e9 novel. \"Scarlett\", whose father lived in Britain, easily obtained permission to travel to London, and while she was there she covertly asked Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 friends to help. They contrived a conducting engagement in Switzerland as cover. Panufnik was anxious not to arouse suspicion by appearing too eager to accept the invitation when it arrived. While Panufnik was fulfilling the engagement, the Polish Legation in Switzerland became aware of his impending escape, and urgently recalled him to the Polish Embassy. Panufnik gave members of the Secret Police who were following him the slip during an alarming night-time taxi-ride through Z\u00fcrich. He eventually boarded a flight for London, and was granted political asylum on arrival. His defection made international headlines. The Polish government branded him a traitor, immediately suppressing his music and any record of his conducting achievements, publicising numerous calumnies against him. Although a few subsequent Polish performances nevertheless did occur (as shown by the Panufnik scholar Adrian Thomas), with his defection Panufnik became a nonperson, and remained so until 1977."]}, {"page": "Gresham Professor of Music", "response": ["| 33 || Adrian Thomas || 1 September 2003"]}, {"page": "Orchestral suites (Bach)", "response": ["The Polonaise is a stylization of the Polish folk song \"Wezm\u0119 ja kontusz\" (I'll take my nobleman's robe).Adrian Thomas. \"Beyond the Dance\" in The Cambridge Companion to Chopin, Cambridge Companions to Music No. 3, edited by Jim Samson.
