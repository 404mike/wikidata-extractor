After the departure of Joe Mwasile on loan, funds were made available for Williams to be offered a short-term contract with the Shrimps in October 2012. International clearance problems held up the signing and he finally joined the club on 10 January 2013. Williams made his Football League debut in a match versus Plymouth Argyle five days later, coming on as a 68th-minute substitute for Gary McDonald. He crowned his day with a long-range goal in the 80th minute, though the Shrimps would lose 2\u20131. He scored his second goal in three games versus Dagenham & Redbridge two weeks later, this time scoring a late winner in a 2\u20131 victory. A first start versus York City on 2 February and Man of the Match performances later in the month versus Exeter City and Aldershot Town saw Williams sign a new contract running until the end of the 2013\u201314 season. Williams made 16 appearances and scored two goals during the second half of the 2012\u201313 season."]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["| 6 May 2014 ||  Joe Mwasile ||  Workington || Free || "]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|20||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Joe Mwasile"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|20||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Joe Mwasile"]}]}}
