SOE agents allied themselves with groups resisting the occupation of their countries by Axis powers. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in occupied countries. The SOE supplied resistance groups with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.\nWalters was a courier for the Wheelwright network, working from 3 January 1944 until August 1944 in southwestern France. Twenty-years old when she arrived in France, she was, next to Sonya Butt, the youngest female agent of SOE.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Llewellyn Rhys Prize", "response": ["|1947 || Anne-Marie Walters || Moondrop to Gascony || "]}, {"page": "George Reginald Starr", "response": ["In the estimation of M.R.D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, Starr was one of the half-dozen best agents of the SOE in France. He was one of only three SOE agents to be promoted to the rank of Lt. Colonel, along with Richard Heslop and Francis Cammaerts.Foot, pp. 42, 311, 412. One of the French agents of the SOE, Philippe de Gunzbourg, compared Starr as a leader to Lawrence of Arabia.Hastings, Max (2014), Das Reich, St. Paul, MN: MBI Publishing Company, p. 63 Starr's wartime record was not, however, without controversy. He had a confrontation with Charles de Gaulle after the liberation of France and one of his agents, Anne-Marie Walters, accused him of permitting the torture of captured collaborators.    ", "These initial successes aside, in spring 1943, seemingly forgotten by SOE headquarters in London, Starr was suffering from a skin disease probably caused by stress and contemplating failure and the abandonment of his mission. He sent Denise Bloch, an SOE agent on the run from another part of France, to Spain and hence to England with a written report (violating his own rule against written communication) requesting money and a wireless operator of his own. London's immediate answer was to send an aeroplane to hover over Castelnau to communicate with Starr by short-range S-Phone to determine that he was still alive. Starr affirmed his existence by greeting the pilot with a string of expletives and finally got attention from London. It was soon \"raining containers\" full of arms and equipment for the maquis.Glass, pp. 72\u201379 Starr's SOE team would expand to include explosives expert Claude Arnault, wireless operator Yvonne Cormeau, and courier Anne-Marie Walters.", "M.R.D Foot said that the motto of every successful secret agent was \"dubito, ergo sum\" (\"I doubt, therefore I survive.\"), and Starr is on a short list of agents who survived by paying careful attention to security.Foot, p. 311  Starr's caution extended to the people he worked with. On the boat which brought him to France in 1942 he complained about being \"in charge of three bloody women,\" Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Le Ch\u00eane, Mary Katherine Herbert, and Odette Sansom, all SOE agents. He took a special dislike to Sansom, who would become one of the most honoured SOE agents. In December 1942, he was suspicious of another SOE agent, Denise Bloch, who was fleeing from the Gestapo. He initially thought her to be a nuisance and contemplated her \"liquidation,\" but learned to trust her, sending her back to the United Kingdom with an appeal for SOE assistance to his network. Starr also broke with Henri Sevenet, the Frenchman who had brought him to southwestern France and helped him become established.Glass, Charles (2018), They Fought Alone New York: Penquin Press, pp 10\u201311, 46\u201348 Among his complaints about his courier, Anne-Marie Walters, was that she wore \"high Paris fashion,\" thus violating his principle of being inconspicuous.Hastings, Max (2013), Das Reich, Minneapolis: Zenith Press, p. 66", "The National Gunpowder Factory near the city of Toulouse was a high priority for destruction by the allies.  However, a daylight bombing raid by the Royal Air Force would kill many of the 6,000 French workers at the 'factory.  London asked Starr to try to destroy the 'factory as an alternative to bombing.  In March 1944 Claude Arnault and Anne-Marie Walters smuggled explosives to Toulouse.  On 28 March, Arnault sneaked into the plant at night, placed explosives, and destroyed 30 electric motors out of 31 in the 'factory which were used to grind gunpowder. The 'factory was out of operation for six weeks.Glass, pp. 155\u2013156", "In late July 1944, Starr ordered his youthful courier, Anne-Marie Walters, to leave France accusing her of disobedience. When Walters returned to London, she said that Starr had countenanced torture of French collaborators with the Germans. On 1 November 1944, Starr, who had returned to London, was interviewed by SOE. He recounted \"with relish\" an incident of torture, causing consternation in the SOE although the interviewers said that he could not be blamed for the tortures committed by the French Resistance.  In February 1945, a court of enquiry with testimony from Starr, Walters, and others took place.  The part of the transcript of the enquiry containing Walter's testimony has disappeared from the record. On 28 February, the conclusion of the \"rather perfunctory court of enquiry\" (in the words of M.R.D. Foot),Foot, p. 436 was that \"there is no justification whatever for any imputation against Lt. Col. Starr of inhumanity or cruel treatment to any prisoner at any time under his control or under the control or troops or resistance forces under his immediate command or control.\"Hewson, pp. 233\u2013235"]}, {"page": "International School of Geneva", "response": ["*Anne-Marie WaltersWAAF officer and Special Operations Executive (SOE) agent for the United Kingdom in occupied France during World War II"]}, {"page": "Women's Auxiliary Air Force", "response": ["* Section Officer Anne-Marie Walters, awarded the MBE."]}, {"page": "List of SOE agents", "response": ["| Anne-Marie Walters || F, Starr, Wheelwright || British || 1923\u20131998 || ST, CdeG, DM, FGS, MFG, MBE, WM || WAAF Officer.
