At half way James Moore took the lead, breaking clear \"at the speed of lightning\", according to Cycling Record, and won in 3 minutes and 50 seconds to the \"frenetic hurrahs\" of the crowd. Moore and Polocini were presented with gold medals worth one hundred francs awarded by the Compagnie Parisienne. Moore's was engraved with his name and carried the effigy of Napoleon III.
