Griffin had given the last rites to IRA volunteer Seamus Quirke, who was shot by members of the Royal Irish Constabulary on 9 September 1920, and took part in the funeral mass for Sinn F\u00e9in councillor and local businessman Michael Walsh, who was killed by a group of armed men \"with English accents\" who claimed to be \"English secret service men\" on 19 October 1920, just weeks before Griffin's own murder. The Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lieutenant Colonel Sir Hamar Greenwood, described Griffin to the House of Commons as \"an extreme Sinn Feiner\" who allegedly \"told his congregation that some among them were as bad as the \"Black and Tans.\"\" However, Greenwood professed ignorance as to the involvement of the British military in Griffin's disappearance, stating \"I do not believe for a moment that this priest has been kidnapped by any of the forces of the Crown. It is obviously a stupid thing that no forces of the Crown would do.\" One Irish Member of Parliament, Jeremiah McVeagh, openly accused Greenwood of complicity, claiming \"It was your own men, your minions, who committed the murder. You know it.\" After his resignation, the former commander of the Auxiliary Division, Brigadier General Frank Percy Crozier, subsequently admitted to the press \"that Auxiliaries had murdered Father Griffin\"."]}, {"page": "F.
