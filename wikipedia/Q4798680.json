He lodged an election petition, attempting to have the result overturned due to alleged bribery, treating and illegal payments by his Conservative opponent Arthur Fell. The election court found that treating and bribery had indeed taken place, but the two judges sitting on the case did not agree whether Fell was responsible for the actions of a Mr Baker who was found to have had acted illegally. The first judge, Justice Channell, held that Baker was acting as an agent of Fell; but the more senior judge, Justice Grantham, held that Fell was not responsible, and the petition was therefore dismissed.  However, the outcome was widely denounced as perverse, and was one of a series of election petition judgments in which Grantham (himself a former Conservative MP) was seen to have acted in a partisan manner. The judgment in the Yarmouth petition was the subject of a debate in the Commons in July 1906 in which Grantham's partisanship was widely condemned."]}, {"page": "Sir Arthur Fell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Fell"]}, {"page": "Fell, Arthur", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Fell"]}, {"page": "Charles Fell", "response": ["Fell was born in Nelson in 1844.Fell, Charles Yates, 'Whos Who in New Zealand and the Western Pacific 1908, Gary H Scholefield and E Schwabe (Editors), Gordon and Gotch Proprietary Limited (Publisher) He was the son of Alfred Fell, merchant and early settler, brother of the English politician Arthur Fell and grandson of Henry Seymour, after whom Seymour Square in Blenheim is named."]}, {"page": "Alfred Fell", "response": ["Fell was born at Nelson, New Zealand, on 17 January 1878, the son of Nelson mayor and painter, Charles Fell.
