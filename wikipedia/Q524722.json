Tensions grew between the manager and chairman, Gunnar G\u00edslason, in the 2004\u201305 season. Pulis was frustrated with his lack of transfer funds which led to Dave Brammer and Steve Simonsen, both of whom were free agents, being his only significant signings prior to the start of the season. Pulis, however, did add Anthony Pulis, his son, and Lewis Buxton to his squad in January 2005. The disagreement between Pulis and the club's Icelandic ownership culminated with Pulis parting company with the club on 28 June 2005. He was sacked for \"failing to exploit the foreign transfer market\" by then chairman G\u00edslason. Following his dismissal, Pulis bemoaned the club's decision to sell Ade Akinbiyi to Championship rivals Burnley, stating, \"We sold our top scorer and never replaced him.\" Dutch manager Johan Boskamp was named as Pulis' successor on 29 June 2005, only a day after Pulis was sacked."]}, {"page": "Rab Douglas", "response": ["The club would finish in second place that season, but advanced to the Scottish Premier League to replace Rangers.

Douglas made thirty appearances until in mid-March and his future at Dens Park was under threat after being replaced late in the 2012\u201313 season by Steve Simonsen and a fall out with new manager John Brown, though Brown claimed that injuries were the main factor in why Douglas was dropped. This led to speculation that Douglas' time at Dens Park was on the verge of ending. On 8 May 2013, with the club now relegated to the First Division, it was announced that Douglas would not be offered a new contract.

Howard remained first-choice keeper until he suffered a thigh injury in the eleventh minute at Matchroom Stadium against Leyton Orient in October 2012, an injury that kept him out of the side for twelve weeks. Replaced by George Long, Howard was unable to regain his place in the team, despite having started the 2012\u201313 season as first-choice. The following season initially saw Howard continue to play understudy to Long, making only a handful of appearances until he was recalled to the starting lineup by new manager Nigel Clough for an FA Cup tie against Fulham in February 2014.

Achterberg then secured his place as Rovers' first choice goalkeeper after Coyne was transferred to Grimsby Town in 1999. Achterberg became part of the giant-killing cup teams that defeated such opponents as Everton, Southampton and other big teams. However after refusing to sign a new contract he was dropped by John Aldridge for the 2000 Football League Cup Final and replaced by Joe Murphy. Achterberg's proficiency in goal was exemplified by the 20 clean sheets he kept during the 2003\u201304 season under the stewardship of Brian Little. One of his more memorable performances was against Millwall in an FA Cup quarter final at The New Den which was televised on BBC 1.

The next two games were the biggest of the season so far, with Wednesday facing rivals Chesterfield at home, and then there was the Steel City derby against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Going into the Chesterfield game Wednesday were without Liam Palmer who had been called up to the Scotland U-21 side, and defender Reda Johnson being called up to the Benin national football team. With Johnson scoring the winning goal in the previous game and being named in the team of the week, Wednesday would have to deal without him. Wednesday did go onto win the game comfortably in a 3\u20131 win, with goals from Lewis Buxton, Gary Madine, and loanee Ben Marshall, with former Sheffield Wednesday player Leon Clarke getting a consolation goal just before Wednesday's third. The win took The Owls into the automatic-promotion position of second. In the build-up to the biggest game of the season so far, the Steel City derby against Sheffield United, Wednesday had some good news with top scorer Gary Madine winning The Football League Young Player of the Month award for September. The highly anticipated first Steel City derby of the season was at Bramall Lane in front of over 28,000 fans, and an over a further 11,000 watched the game at Hillsborough Stadium on three large television screens. Wednesday started the game well, and was neutrally supported to have been unlucky to find themselves behind, but at half-time The Owls had not taken their chances and The Blades had taken their two, with Stephen Quinn and Ched Evans finding the net to make it 2\u20130. The second half was more of an even contest, but The Owls still seemed to be making more chances. Finally, their well and truly deserved goals came twice in four minutes with ten minutes of the game left to play, Chris O'Grady and Gary Madine both scored with headers. Captain Rob Jones nearly grabbed an amazing win in the final minutes but his header was straight at goalkeeper Steve Simonsen. The game finished 2\u20132, and although Megson felt 'over the course of the game' Wednesday deserved to win, although it was the Wednesday fans who went home the happier. The week after Wednesday's amazing comeback saw David McGoldrick go back to Nottingham Forest after spending one-month on loan, scoring one goal and making four appearances. Also, youngster Nathan Modest left the club by mutual consent on 18 October, after making four appearances in 2008 for the club, and unable to break into the side since, he later signed for local club Sheffield F.C. The Owls built on the Steel City derby result as they won Colchester United 2\u20130 the next weekend. Goals from captain Rob Jones and Reda Johnson in the second half won the game at Hillsborough. Tuesday 25 October saw Wednesday travel to Carlisle United. Unfortunately for The Owls they ended up dropping points and went two points behind second-place Huddersfield Town after losing 3\u20132. Impressive loanee Ben Marshall scored against his former club to open the game, before Carlisle United scored three in the second-half, with goals from Lee Miller, Rory Loy, and Liam Noble. To make matters worse, top scorer Gary Madine gained his second bookable offence and got sent-off, but still pushing to somehow get back in the game Rob Jones scored his second in two games, but it was not enough for Sheffield Wednesday. Wednesday were away again in the league at the weekend, this time against Wycombe Wanderers. Vice-captain Jose Semedo scored his first goal for the club to put The Owls in the lead. However, the lead just lasted six-minutes when a wonderful solo dribble and shot saw Jordon Ibe score. Jordon Ibe became the youngest ever player to score for Wycombe Wanderers at just an amazing 15 years and 244 days old on his first-start for the club. Another, first goal for a club came when Ryan Lowe scored to put Wednesday back in the lead, after recently coming back from injury. The goal was enough to seal a 2\u20131 victory for The Owls. The last piece of news in October was that Wednesday were drawn away in Round 1 to Morecambe in the 2011-12 FA Cup, with the game due to be played on the weekend of 12 November."]}]}}
