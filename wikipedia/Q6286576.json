He began playing for the Derbyshire second XI during the 1948 season. During the 1949 season he played three first team matches when he took wickets in all the matches and as a tail ender was only out once. His debut in the County Championship was in June against Sussex, and he only lost his wicket when he was run out against New Zealand. A season when there were four powerful bowlers in the Derbyshire team gave Rimmer little chance to show his bowling credentials and he returned to the Second XI where he played in the 1950 season.\nRimmer was a right-arm medium-pace bowler and took five first-class wickets with an average of 52.80 and a best performance of 2 for 71. He was a right-handed batsman and played three innings in three first-class matches in which he made one run altogether.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1949", "response": ["Laurie Johnson, who went on to become a major performer for the county, made his debut in 1949 while fellow West Indian Michael Frederick also made his debut, but only took part in two first class matches. Dick Sale and Tom Hall played in their first of several seasons for the club, as did George Lowe although he appeared intermittently. Joseph Rimmer and Maurice Snape made their only appearances for Derbyshire in two matches in the season, while Kenneth Shearwood appeared once as a stop-gap wicket-keeper.
