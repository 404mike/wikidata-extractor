The popes have not on the basis of this right employed the title \"universal bishop\". Pope Gregory I (6th century) condemned the use of this expression by the patriarch of Constantinople of this title, and even said that whoever claims it \"is, in his elation, the precursor of Antichrist\". According to John Norman Davidson Kelly, Gregory I was not in any way denying the universal jurisdiction of the bishop of Rome; to Kelly, Gregory I \"was indefatigable ... in upholding the Roman primacy, and successfully maintained Rome's appellate jurisdiction in the east. ... Gregory argued that St. Peter's commission [e.g. in Matthew 16:18f] made all churches, Constantinople included, subject to Rome\". In 1998, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith explained that while every bishop is a subject of the  (in ref. to 2 Co 11:28), \"In the case of the Bishop of Rome - Vicar of Christ in the way proper to Peter as Head of the College of Bishops - the  acquires particular force because it is combined with the full and supreme power in the Church: a truly episcopal power, not only supreme, full and universal, but also immediate, over all pastors and other faithful.\" Gregory I himself, though he asserted the reality of the primacy of the bishop of his apostolic see, the bishop who carried on the work entrusted to Peter, rejected use of the title \"universal bishop\", which he called \"profane\"."]}, {"page": "J.

The subsequent rediscovery in Western Europe of EnochThe Muggletonians did not produce their own edition of Enoch but they did reprint a glossary of names and difficult words from the book. Signification of the proper names occurring in the Book of Enoch from the Hebrew & Chaldee Rev. D. A. De Sola London: Isaac Frost (1852) did much to bolster the Muggletonian view that they were on the right track.Isaac Frost's Two systems of Astronomy (1846) was directly inspired by this Since Jude and Revelation are the two concluding books of the New Testament, they seemed to point ahead to a Third Commission and to  a Muggletonian future. According to modern exegesis,For example, John Norman Davidson Kelly Commentary on the Epistles of Peter and Jude London: A&C Black (1969) verses 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16 and 21 of Jude draw upon the book of Enoch whilst verse 6 can be derived from nowhere else and verses 14 and 15 give an openly acknowledged quote from it. What was generally important about Enoch was that he was the seventh from Adam (considered an auspiciously holy number), that he walked with God, and that he was translated directly from life on earth to heaven. What is important in the specific context of Jude is that Enoch is sufficient prophet of the reprobates' doom because, unusually, Enoch claimed to be a prophet of future times, not of his own. He alone, it was said, knew the secrets of time, whereas the rest of us know nothing."]}, {"page": "Truth's Triumph", "response": ["The doctrine of the two seeds (the seed of the woman versus the seed of the serpent) explains the conflict of natures found within everyone. Good and evil cannot derive from one source; evil cannot come from God and is never simply the misapplication of things intended for good. This mixing of seeds first began when the sons of Seth took wives from the daughters of wicked men.The notion that Cain is, quite literally, born of the devil is not a Muggletonian innovation. It was an idea in Jewish antiquity which still surfaces here and there in New Testament writing, a possible example is 1 John 3:12 So, even Abraham had both seeds within him. It is which seed comes to the top in a person which will determine his or her fate at the end of time with the judgment of the 'second death'.The notion of a second death is, likewise, not original to Muggletonians. It was a commonplace in Jewish thought at the time of Jesus although by no means universally accepted. Hence it finds its way into Revelation. It has had a checkered history in the Anglican articles of faith. John Norman Davidson Kelly The Epistles of Peter and Jude London: A&C Black (1969) p. 273 Hence the Lord loved Jacob and hated Esau before they had done either good or evil. Yet Esau gained great blessings along the way even if he will ultimately be cursed by the bad seed within. This form of inheritance means, generally, \"it is a great privilege to be a child of a good parent.\" Or, as Tomkinson memorably puts it; bastard begets bastard.Tomkinson Truth's Triumph p. 111 This is a parallel to the way there is generally a physical resemblance between child and parent and it explains Rebecca's anguish, \"if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth ... what good will my life do me?\" Yet the rule is not rigid and, ultimately, its workings are a mystery of God's will."]}]}}
