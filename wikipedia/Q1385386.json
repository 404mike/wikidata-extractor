However, during a North American tour in May, Lemmy was caught in possession of amphetamine crossing the border from the US into Canada. The border police mistook the powder for cocaine and he was jailed, forcing the band to cancel some shows. Fed up with his erratic behaviour, the band dismissed the bass player replacing him with their long-standing friend and former Pink Fairies guitarist Paul Rudolph.

Lemmy was also the primary songwriter and only constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Mot\u00f6rhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor and guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke.", "Lemmy wanted the music to be \"fast and vicious, just like the MC5\". His stated aim was to \"concentrate on very basic music: loud, fast, city, raucous, arrogant, paranoid, speedfreak rock n roll ... it will be so loud that if we move in next door to you, your lawn will die\". He recruited guitarist Larry Wallis (formerly of Pink Fairies) on the recommendation of Mick Farren, based on Wallis' work with Steve Peregrin Took's band Shagrat, and Lucas Fox on drums. According to Lemmy, the band's first practice was at the now defunct Sound Management rehearsal studios, in Kings Road, Chelsea in 1975. Sound Management leased the basement area of furniture store The Furniture Cave, located in adjacent Lots Road. Kilmister has said they used to steal equipment, as the band was short on gear.

On a new label, Chrysalis Records, the revamped UFO recorded a non-LP single in 1973, \"Give Her the Gun\" and \"Sweet Little Thing\" with producer Derek Lawrence. In 1974, under producer Leo Lyons (formerly of Ten Years After), UFO recorded Phenomenon, which highlighted the band's harder-edged guitar sound. Phenomenon contains many fan favourites such as \"Doctor Doctor\" (later a minor hit single as a live track) and \"Rock Bottom\" (which was extended live to provide a showcase for Schenker).

Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal.; ;  Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part of it, because they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene.
