He later managed the club for 15 years and in total served Queen's Park for over 30 years. Hunter represented Scotland at amateur level and made one friendly appearance for Great Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Queen's Park F.C.", "response": ["With stalwarts such as Cromar, Hastie and Omand all having moved on, the mid-1960s saw a new side which promised much. Future Scotland Internationalist Bobby Clark played in goal in 1964\u201365 season as Queen's finished fourth. That finish was again achieved in 1968, with Queen's winning 20 games (eight in succession towards the end) and scoring 76 goals. It was a formidable side which featured established Spiders Malky Mackay Sr. (the father of Malky Mackay), Peter Buchanan and Eddie Hunter. Ultimately, no success was gained, however, and as that side splintered, the club toiled until the mid-70s.", "Former player Eddie Hunter took charge and within two seasons, Queen's had been promoted as 1980\u201381 champions. The talent in the side was obvious. Derek Atkins was an ever-present in goal, John McGregor a high scoring defender and Jimmy Nicholson and Gerry McCoy netted a combined tally of 28 goals.The Men with the Educated Feet, F.H.C Robertson, Page 123 Much of the side was inexperienced, with full-back Bobby Dickson one of the few who had been a mainstay in previous years. After a highly respectable finish of 8th the following season, Queen's finished bottom and were relegated in 1983. The main reason for this was the loss of some of the best players who had won promotion. In particular, John McGregor and Alan Irvine departed, leaving for Liverpool and Everton respectively. During the same season, Queen's lost 2\u20131 to Rangers at Hampden in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals.", "====Eddie Hunter====", "Eddie Hunter was fired in December 1994 as Queen's failed to recapture the achievements of the previous decade. Former Alloa Athletic manager Hugh McCann was appointed as his successor but after an 8th-place finish in the new 10 team Third Division, he left the club. Graeme Elder took over as player/coach but the team continued their disappointing run and he eventually resigned. A happier memory from this time was the 5\u20131 demolition of Albion Rovers at Hampden in August 1997, the opposition finishing the match with seven players. There was also an incredible 5\u20135 draw at East Fife in Hunter's last season, with fan favourite Brian McPhee scoring four goals for Queen's.", "The club's constitution was changed prior to the appointment of the next manager, which meant that Queen's could sign former professionals provided they were not paid by the club. Former Dundee manager John McCormack was unveiled in July 1998 as the new head coach. Like Eddie Hunter, McCormack succeeded in winning the league after just two seasons. The new boss used the new legislation to great effect and even persuaded the club to allow the loaning of professionals. The ex-pros and the committed amateurs combined to give Queen's a superb start to the league season and it was November before defeat was felt. A 4\u20130 loss to challengers Forfar Athletic towards the end of the season was quickly forgotten as Queen's won their last five matches, clinching the Championship at Cowdenbeath on the final day of 1999\u20132000. The addition of ex-pros such as Neil Inglis, Paul Martin, Graham Connell and Johnny Whelan helped. The late loan signing of Paul Walker from Stranraer also proved to be very shrewd as he scored two winning goals in the final run-in. After nearly 20 years of service to the club, Ross Caven won a Championship medal and there was also success for the hard-working Danny Ferry who had been with Queen's through the lean spells of the 90s."]}, {"page": "List of one-club men in association football", "response": ["*Eddie Hunter (Queen's Park): player 1964\u20131974; coach 1974\u20131979; manager 1979\u20131994."]}, {"page": "Eddie Hunter", "response": ["Eddie Hunter may refer to:", "* Eddie Hunter (footballer, born 1928) (1928\u20132002), Scottish footballer (Falkirk FC)", "* Eddie Hunter (footballer, born 1943), Scottish footballer and manager (Queen's Park)", "* Eddie Hunter (baseball) (1905\u20131967), Major League Baseball third baseman", "* Eddie Hunter (EastEnders), fictional character on the British soap opera EastEnders", "* Eddie Hunter (American football) (born 1965), American football player"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football championship-winning managers", "response": ["|  Eddie Hunter"]}, {"page": "List of Queen's Park F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Joe Gilrory \u2192 Eddie Hunter", "| rowspan=\"15\" |Eddie Hunter", "|Eddie Hunter \u2192 Hugh McCann"]}, {"page": "List of longest managerial reigns in association football", "response": ["| Eddie Hunter"]}]}}
