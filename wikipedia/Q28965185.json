During the course of the 1925 season, he played a further six first-class matches, the last coming against Oxford University.  His awarding of a Cambridge Blue at the end of that season proved controversial and was widely criticised.  His batting average that season was just 10.75, with a high score of 27*, while his bowling had yielded just one wicket.  He was preferred to two batsmen on the team, one a previous blue and both established county players. His captain, Tris Bennett, explained that Payne was \"the equal of any fieldsman in England\" and was worth his place in the team for his fielding alone.Wisden 1974, p. 132."]}, {"page": "English cricket team in the West Indies in 1925\u201326", "response": ["*Tris Bennett"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Tris Bennett (1925/26\u20131928) : C.
