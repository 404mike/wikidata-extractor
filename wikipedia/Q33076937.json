Their union was solemnised by taking the sacrament together on Easter Sunday in 1834 at Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York, which bears a commemorative plaque acknowledging the event. Walker inherited half of her family's estate, Crow Nest, located in Lightcliffe, West Yorkshire, near Shibden Hall, Lister's family estate, in Calderdale. Both women inherited their respective estates during the early 19th century, when primogeniture, the custom of granting lands and property to the oldest surviving son, dominated European law and society. They were travelling abroad together when Lister fell ill and died. Research into their diaries and letters suggest Walker may have experienced bouts of anxiety and depression throughout portions of her life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1854", "response": ["* February 25 \u2013 Ann Walker, English landowner and philanthropist (b. 1803)"]}, {"page": "1803", "response": ["* May 20 \u2013 Ann Walker, English landowner and philanthropist (d. 1854)"]}, {"page": "Sutton Park, North Yorkshire", "response": ["It was a filming location for the house of Ann Walker in the BBC television series Gentleman Jack."]}, {"page": "Anne Lister", "response": ["Lister was from a minor landowning family at Shibden in Calderdale, West Riding of Yorkshire, and conducted multiple lesbian affairs from her schooldays onwards, often on long trips abroad. Muscular and masculine in appearance, dressed only in black, and highly educated, she was later known, generally unkindly, as 'Gentleman Jack'. Her final significant relationship was with Ann Walker, to whom she was notionally married in Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York, now celebrated as the birthplace of lesbian marriage in Britain.", "Although Lister had met her on various occasions in the 1820s, Ann Walker, who by 1832 had become a wealthy heiress, took on a much more substantial role in Lister's life. Eventually the women took communion together on Easter Sunday (30 March) 1834 in Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York, and thereafter considered themselves married, but without legal recognition. The church has been described as \"an icon for what is interpreted as the site of the first lesbian marriage to be held in Britain\", and the building now hosts a commemorative blue plaque.

This required a 10-hour hike to reach the top, and another 7 to descend.\u00a0", "Her last and greatest trip began in 1839. Leaving Shibden Hall in June with Ann Walker and two servants, they travelled in their own carriage through France, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia, arriving in St Petersburg in September and in Moscow in October. With a reluctant Ann Walker in tow, she left Moscow in February 1840 in a new Russian carriage and very warm clothing. They travelled south, along the frozen Volga river, to the Caucasus. Few West Europeans had visited this area, let alone West European women, in part because of unrest amongst the local population against the Tsarist regime. At times they needed a military escort. The two women were a source of great curiosity to the people they visited. As Anne noted in her diary, \"The people coming in to look at us as if we were some strange animals such as they had not seen the like before\".", "Lister died on 22 September 1840, aged 49, of a fever at Koutais (now Kutaisi in Georgia) while travelling with Ann Walker.

Abovian was appointed as the supervisor of the Tiflis uyezd school and married a German woman named Emilia Looze (died 1870) in 1839. In 1840 he was approached by English traveler Anne Lister, who was visiting Tiflis with her partner Ann Walker.
