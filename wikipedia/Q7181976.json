He became an apprentice with the club after leaving school in 1980, with his performances for Chester's reserve and youth sides prompting a call up to the Wales Youth side for the 1981 European Youth Championships.Harrington made his first\u2013team debut for Chester in a 3\u20131 home win over Huddersfield Town on 20 February 1982. He went on to make 76 appearances over the next three years, amid competition from Grenville Millington, Mike Salmon, Billy O'Rourke and John Butcher. Harrington was first\u2013choice goalkeeper at Chester by the end of 1982\u201383, but an injury in the penultimate game of the season at Torquay United prematurely ended his campaign and led to defender Noel Bradley having to deputise for him. But Harrington recovered in time for one of his most memorable games for Chester in a League Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers in September 1983, when he saved the first three Bolton penalties in the penalty shoot-out to give Chester victory. This season saw him miss just five games for Chester, but unfortunately the campaign ended with the club finishing bottom of The Football League.\nThree months of 1984\u201385 were spent on loan at Oxford United without making any appearances. He then moved on to Blackpool in March 1985, but again did not make the first\u2013team. He did though play two games for both Burnley and Preston North End during 1985\u201386.\nSigned for Cork City in May 1988 as a replacement for Tim Dalton and made his League of Ireland debut on 4 September 1988. Kept 112 clean sheets from 257 appearances in his Cork career.\n\"Biscuits\", as he is nicknamed, re-signed from Avondale F.C. in the 2005 season as cover for the injured Michael Devine in the away UEFA Cup tie against Ekranas [1].

He appointed former Blackpool coach Billy Haydock as his assistant, and signed Blackpool goalkeeper Phil Harrington for a small fee. Also coming out of retirement as a player, his team won the pre-season Munster Senior Cup. He then signed former Stoke City defender Alan Dodd on a month-long deal. O'Keefe also doubled up as the club's commercial manager, and he arranged four Sportsman's Dinner events, with special guests as Jack Charlton, Sir Alex Ferguson, Tommy Docherty, and Emlyn Hughes. The club finished in seventh place in 1987\u201388 and lifted the League of Ireland Cup. Cork were heading to another mid-table place finish in 1988\u201389 when O'Keefe was sacked. Cork terminated his contract to cut costs, as the directors were forced to subsidise the club out of their own pockets.

Chester endured a miserable start to 1983\u201384 and had just one league win to their name when Sainty left the club in November 1983.

He was again first-choice the following season but an injury in September 1979 led to Millington replacing Lloyd in the Chester goal. With Millington now the regular in goal and youngster Phil Harrington emerging from the youth ranks, Lloyd was allowed to join Port Vale on loan in February 1981.
