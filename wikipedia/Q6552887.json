Riasanovsky points to a \"paradoxical dichotomy\" in the black and white images such as God/Antichrist, educator/ignoramus, architect of Russia's greatness/destroyer of national culture, father of his country/scourge of the common man. Voltaire's 1759 biography gave 18th-century Russians a man of the Enlightenment, while Alexander Pushkin's \"The Bronze Horseman\" poem of 1833 gave a powerful romantic image of a creator-god.Nicholas Riasanovsky, The Image of Peter the Great in Russian History and Thought (1985) pp. 57, 84, 279, 283.A.

Slavophiles in mid-19th century deplored Peter's westernization of Russia. Western writers and political analysts recounted \"The Testimony\" or secret will of Peter the Great. It supposedly revealed his grand evil plot for Russia to control the world via conquest of Constantinople, Afghanistan and India. It was a forgery made in Paris at Napoleon's command when he started his invasion of Russia in 1812. Nevertheless it is still quoted in foreign policy circles.Albert Resis, \"Russophobia and the 'Testament' of Peter the Great, 1812-1980 Slavic Review 44#4 (1985), pp. 681-693 online The Communists executed the last Romanovs, and their historians such as Mikhail Pokrovsky presented strongly negative views of the entire dynasty. Stalin however admired how Peter strengthened the state, and wartime, diplomacy, industry, higher education, and government administration.

Lindsey Hughes, a 20th-century historian, has criticized Zotov for giving Peter an education that did not teach what a future tsar ought to know. Her contemporary, Robert K. Massie, has argued that the education was the best possible one for a curious boy like Peter, because it was unlikely that he would ever become tsar, as his half-brother, Ivan V, was before him in the line of succession. According to Massie, although Zotov may have not taught Peter at the highest possible level, he delivered \"the best education for a mind like Peter's\", as it \"stimulated [Peter's] curiosity\" and allowed him to become \"in large part, a self-taught man\". Zotov's closeness to the Tsar later became a source of worry to others in government, many of whom\u2014including even the powerful Menshikov\u2014feared his influence.", "According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he intended to have him marry a second time, to Anna Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a monastery. However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov came up with the idea to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke."]}, {"page": "UCL Faculty of Social and Historical Sciences", "response": ["In May 2003, a team from the Department of Anthropology published a major piece of research on the possible link between the amount of food that a mother has to eat and the gender of her children.
