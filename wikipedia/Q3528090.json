Larwood took 6 for 32 in the Australian first innings, bowling at a speed that Wisdens S.J. Southerton described as \"faster than I have ever seen him\". According to Jardine's biographer Christopher Douglas, this bowling, which included a spell of 3 wickets in 5 overs for 9 runs, delivered a lasting blow to Australian morale and was a major factor in England's ultimate series victory.Douglas, pp. 68\u201369 The match saw a low-key Test debut by Don Bradman, who scored 18 and 1 and was dropped for the second Test, before being rapidly reinstated for the third.Perry, pp. 86\u201392 and p. 97 England maintained their ascendancy during the second, third and fourth Tests, though with decreasing victory margins; Australia finally achieved success in the last match, giving England a 4\u20131 series victory.Swanton, p. 34 A combination of hard pitches, stifling heat, and long matches reduced Larwood's effectiveness as the tour progressed. He finished the Test series with 18 wickets at 40.22, behind George Geary (19 at 25.11) and Jack White (25 at 30.80). In all first-class matches on the tour, Larwood took 40 wickets at 31.35; as a batsman he scored 367 runs, averaging 26.21. Larwood's occasional tactic of bowling leg theory, that is, in the direction of the batsman's legs to a concentration of leg side fielders, had been noted by the Australian former bowler Arthur Mailey. In his report on the fourth Test, Mailey wrote, Larwood resorted to his \"famous leg theory\" after receiving severe punishment from the Australian batsman Archie Jackson, but the change brought no success: \"All theories and all bowlers were alike to [Jackson]\".Larwood and Perkins, p. 62"]}, {"page": "1926 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 George Geary, Harold Larwood, Jack Mercer, Bert Oldfield, Bill Woodfull"]}, {"page": "Wally Hammond", "response": ["While on tour in South Africa in 1927\u201328, Hammond did not dominate as expected. Still recovering from his illness, he was worn out from the strain of a long season. He showed good batting form, but once George Geary was injured, a strong but not fully representative side found itself short of bowling, forcing Hammond to play as an all-rounder.Howat, p. 33.Foot, p. 109. In all first-class matches on the tour, he scored 908 runs at an average of 47.78, and took 27 wickets at an average of 23.85. His Test debut came in the first match of the series, as he scored a quick 51 in his only innings and took five wickets for 36 runs in the South African second innings. At one point, he took three wickets for no runs and his bowling was described by Wisden as a key factor in an England victory. His best innings came in the third Test as he reached 90. He had some good bowling spells, and in the fourth Test he removed both South African openers. An innings of 66 in the fifth and final Test left him with 321 runs at an average of 40.12 in his debut series, while his 15 wickets cost 26.60 runs each. All of Hammond's batting appearances were at number four in the order; of his 140 career Test innings, 118 were at number three or four.

In the third Test, England began the fourth innings requiring 332 to win on a rain-damaged pitch, a task critics believed impossible.Lemmon, p. 87. A large opening partnership from Hobbs and Sutcliffe gave England a chance, and Hobbs sent a message to the England dressing room suggesting a tactical change in the batting order. But the team could not find Chapman, who according to Percy Fender, in attendance as a journalist, spent most of his time socialising with guests in the Ladies' Stand. Consequently, the team followed Hobbs' plan without the approval of the captain.Douglas, pp. 74\u201375. England's batsmen took the total to within 14 of victory when the fourth wicket fell. Chapman came in and batted in an unusual way; after attempting some big shots, he played ultra-defensively, possibly in an attempt to allow Patsy Hendren to reach fifty runs before England won. Hendren was out soon after, then Chapman tried to hit a six and was caught. The batsmen continued to play recklessly and a further wicket fell to a run out. Douglas describes the end of the match: \"Meanwhile, [England batsman George Geary] was quite unruffled by the sudden upsets. He wound up for the next delivery and thumped it through mid-on for 4, bellowing, 'Dammit, we've done 'em!' It was an appropriate way for a side under Chapman to win the Ashes.\"Douglas, p. 77.

He played in nine Test matches but was never picked for a home Test or for an Ashes tour. However, for the best part of three decades he was a vital member of a generally struggling Leicestershire team. With no amateur able to play frequently for the county, Astill became the first officially appointed professional captain of any county for over fifty years in 1935. The county enjoyed a useful season, but at forty-seven years of age, Astill was only a stop gap before an amateur of the required standard and availability could be found.Gentlemen v Players Vol.II M.Marshall He was a nephew of Leicestershire fast bowler Thomas Jayes."]}, {"page": "George Macaulay", "response": ["Macaulay was selected for the third Test against Australia at Headingley, possibly because Arthur Carr, the England captain, expected the pitch to favour spinners. The Australians were concerned that Macaulay represented a threat to their batting, but the match did not work out in Macaulay's favour as a bowler; having been dropped at the start of play, Charlie Macartney played what Wisden called one of the best innings of his career and vigorously attacked the England bowling, achieving the rare feat of scoring a century before the lunch interval. The Australian batsman had asked his captain if he could attack Macaulay in particular, and the Yorkshire bowler suffered as Macartney quickly dominated him. Macaulay eventually had Macartney caught after hitting a short ball in the air, but it was Macaulay's only success in the innings. Macaulay conceded 123 runs in 32 overs as Australia scored 494. When Macaulay came into bat from number ten in the batting order, England were 182 for eight wickets and facing defeat. He played an attacking innings of 76, hitting ten fours, in a partnership of 108 with George Geary. This began an England recovery which helped the team to escape with a draw. Nevertheless, Macaulay did not play in the final two Tests of the series. Later in the season, he took fourteen wickets for 92 runs against Gloucestershire, including eight for 43 in the second innings. These were the best bowling figures of his career that he achieved in a match. Apart from his batting success in the Test match, Macaulay scored another two fifties and in the match against Somerset achieved a century."]}, {"page": "1981 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 6 March \u2013 George Geary, English cricketer (born 1893)"]}, {"page": "Fox and Goose Ground", "response": ["* Best bowling in an innings: 7\u201358 by George Geary for Leicestershire v Worcestershire, 1913", "* Best bowling in a match: 11\u2013112 by George Geary, Leicestershire v Worcestershire, 1914"]}, {"page": "College Ground, Loughborough", "response": ["* Best bowling in an innings: 6\u201332 by George Geary for Leicestershire v Glamorgan, 1929", "* Best bowling in a match: 10\u201374 by George Geary, as above"]}, {"page": "John Coventry (cricketer)", "response": ["while in August he took his first wicket for six years when he had Leicestershire's George Geary caught by Peter Jackson."]}, {"page": "Solomon Joel", "response": ["In the 1924\u201325 South African cricket season, Joel organised a team of mostly English players to tour the country and play matches against the national and provincial teams.
