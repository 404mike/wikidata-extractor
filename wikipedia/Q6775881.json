The son of two prominent communist activists, Arnold Kettle (best remembered as a literary critic; 1916\u20131986) and Margot Kettle (n\u00e9e Gale; 1916\u20131995), he was educated at Leeds Modern School and Balliol College, Oxford.\nKettle worked for the National Council for Civil Liberties (now known as Liberty) as a research officer from 1973. He then began his career in journalism as home affairs correspondent for New Society (1977\u20131981) and moved to The Sunday Times in 1981, working as a political correspondent for three years. He has been with The Guardian since 1984 and also wrote regularly for Marxism Today in its later years. He writes a column on classical music in Prospect magazine.\nKettle is best known as a columnist for The Guardian, where he is assistant editor, having worked as the newspaper's Washington D.C. bureau chief from 1997 to 2001. He was formerly a leader writer (1993\u20131997) and chief leader writer from 2001 onward. He has often defended New Labour and Tony Blair (a personal friend) \u2013 though not over the Iraq War. However, soon after the 2010 general election, Kettle wrote that David Cameron's Conservative-led coalition government had had a positive effect on the country. Kettle has been dismissed by John Pilger as Blair's \"most devoted promoter\".Kettle has a low opinion of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Kettle wrote that \"[t]he immediate effect of the judgment [when the Supreme Court declared the prorogation of Parliament invalid] is devastating for Johnson. It is expressed so cogently and unambiguously that it will be difficult for him to wriggle out of it \u2013 even though he is certainly foolish enough to try.\"In March 2021, Kettle wrote of the current Chancellor: \"Sunak wants to deploy the financial heft of the Treasury to reinstate the UK in the heart of Scotland's economic and political conversation..\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick Delius", "response": ["Beecham had died in 1961, and Fenby writes that it \"seemed to many then that nothing could save Delius's music from extinction\", such was the conductor's unique mastery over the music. However, other conductors have continued to advocate Delius, and since the centenary year, the Delius Society has pursued the aim of \"develop[ing] a greater knowledge of the life and works of Delius\". The music has never become fashionable, a fact often acknowledged by promoters and critics. To suggestions that Delius's music is an \"acquired taste\", Fenby answers: \"The music of Delius is not an acquired taste. One either likes it the moment one first hears it, or the sound of it is once and for ever distasteful to one. It is an art which will never enjoy an appeal to the many, but one which will always be loved, and dearly loved, by the few.\"Fenby (1981), p. 208 Writing in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of Delius's death, the Guardian journalist Martin Kettle recalls Cardus arguing in 1934 that Delius as a composer was unique, both in his technique and in his emotionalism. Although he eschewed classical formalism, it was wrong, Cardus believed, to regard Delius merely as \"a tone-painter, an impressionist or a maker of programme music\". His music's abiding feature is, Cardus wrote, that it \"recollects emotion in tranquillity\u00a0... Delius is always reminding us that beauty is born by contemplation after the event\"."]}, {"page": "Tak\u00e1cs Quartet", "response": ["*Review from Queen Elizabeth Hall by Martin Kettle, The Guardian, 26 February 2007."]}, {"page": "Hutton Inquiry", "response": ["Martin Kettle wrote in The Guardian on 3 February: \"Too many newspapers invested too heavily in a particular preferred outcome on these key points. They wanted the government found guilty on the dossier and on the naming, and they wanted Gilligan's reporting vindicated. When Hutton drew opposite conclusions, they damned his findings as perverse and his report as a whitewash. But the report's weakness was its narrowness, and to some extent its unworldliness, not the accuracy of its verdicts.\""]}, {"page": "Blairism", "response": ["There has been a great deal of discussion in British politics about the Blairite legacy. This intensified after September 2006, when Blair announced his intention to resign within one year and especially since May 2007 when he said he would resign as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007.

Meanwhile, a poll for The Independent by BMG Research, suggested that working class voters were more likely to consider Corbyn \"incompetent\" than those from the middle class, and a higher proportion thought he was also \"out of touch\". Martin Kettle of The Guardian  wrote that \"many Labour MPs, even some who face defeat, want an early election\" to prove decisively that Corbyn's Labour is unelectable as a government, stating that \"If there is hope for Labour it lies with the voters. Only they can change the party\"."]}, {"page": "Guy Fawkes Night", "response": ["Generally, modern 5\u00a0November celebrations are run by local charities and other organisations, with paid admission and controlled access.

David Cressy summarised the modern celebration with these words: \"The rockets go higher and burn with more colour, but they have less and less to do with memories of the Fifth of November\u00a0... it might be observed that Guy Fawkes' Day is finally declining, having lost its connection with politics and religion.
