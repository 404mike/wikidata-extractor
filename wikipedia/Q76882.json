He based himself at the West Riding Lunatic Asylum in Wakefield from 1866 to 1875, and there he taught psychiatry to students from the nearby Leeds School of Medicine and, with David Ferrier, transformed the asylum into a world centre for neuropsychology. Crichton-Browne then served as Lord Chancellor's Visitor from 1875 till 1922.  Throughout his career, Crichton-Browne emphasised the asymmetrical aspects of the human brain and behaviour; and also, like Emil Kraepelin and Alois Alzheimer, made some influential predictions about the neurological changes associated with severe psychiatric disorders. Crichton-Browne was also a forceful advocate of eugenics, and in 1908 became the first president of the Eugenics Education Society.", "Mental Science: Building on the early asylum photography of Hugh Welch Diamond (1809 -1886)Gilman, Sander L.

The complete correspondence between Crichton-Browne and Charles Darwin forms a remarkable contribution to the beginnings of behavioural science.

This solved a problem of representation by artists who were asked to produce illustrations only from description or highly influenced by the interpretation of physicians and surgeons. The first application of photography in medicine appears in 1840 when Alfred Fran\u00e7ois Donn\u00e9 of the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Paris photographed sections of bones and teeth. He began making daguerreotypes through a microscope. Donn\u00e9 published engravings made from photographs by his student L\u00e9on Foucault. Hugh Welch Diamond, a physician and founding member of the Royal Photographic Society, used photography as a tool in medicine, particularly in the field of mental illness. He was working in the women\u2019s section of the Surrey County Asylum in Twickenham in 1852, where he attempted to create a catalog of visual signs of insanity by photographing the patients and organizing the photographs by symptom. Guillaume-Benjamin Duchenne de Boulogne began photographing inmates in the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re mental hospital in Paris in 1856. He devised a method for activating individual muscles of the face through electronic stimulation. With the assistance of Adrien Tournachon, brother of Felix Nadar, he photographed facial expressions and at one point listed 53 emotions that could be identified based on the muscular action. His work was published in 1862 in M\u00e9canisme de la physionomie humaine in what was the most remarkable of all photographically illustrated books in medical science prior to 1900."]}, {"page": "Peter Wickens Fry", "response": ["He apparently experimented with photogenic drawing before Henry Fox Talbot developed the calotype process in 1841.\"Peter Wickens Fry\", Luminous Lint.
