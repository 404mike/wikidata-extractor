Crown tax revenues increased, but more importantly the new system was perceived as fairer and more acceptable.  A war with Luebeck in 1535 resulted in the expulsion of the Hanseatic traders, who previously had had a monopoly of foreign trade.  With its own businessmen in charge Sweden's economic strength grew rapidly, and by 1544 Gustavus had support from 60% of the farmlands in all of Sweden. Sweden now built the first modern army in Europe, supported by a sophisticated tax system and government bureaucracy.  Gustavus proclaimed the Swedish crown hereditary in his family, the house of Vasa.

Britain's envoy at Stockholm, Sir John Goodricke, made adroit use of this money, and helped to maintain Sweden's liberal constitution.

Roberts linked military technology with larger historical consequences, arguing that innovations in tactics, drill and doctrine by the Dutch and Swedes (1560\u20131660), which maximized the utility of firearms, led to a need for more trained troops and thus for permanent forces (standing armies). Armies grew much larger and more expensive. These changes in turn had major political consequences in the level of administrative support and the supply of money, men and provisions, producing new financial demands and the creation of new governmental institutions. \"Thus, argued Roberts, the modern art of war made possible\u2014and necessary\u2014the creation of the modern state\"."]}, {"page": "Early modern warfare", "response": ["Early modern warfare is the era of warfare following medieval warfare.
