His arrival in 1974 introduced a new element to the band's style. He was the first conspicuously trained musician to join, and the sound that emerged on Hall of the Mountain Grill was a previously unheard, lush chaos which sounded a little like Black Sabbath meets The Moody Blues.Before Hawkwind, House played in High Tide and the Third Ear Band, who contributed the soundtrack to Roman Polanski's Macbeth. Guitarist Tony Hill recounted how House became a member of High Tide: \"[Pete Pavli and I were] hanging out with and crashing where we could at Mike's or Wayne's.  Simon ended up crashing there as well. Simon was playing bass then. He said: 'I used to play violin, you know?' So I said 'Get it!' That was basically it.\"He joined Hawkwind in 1974, playing on some of their albums, before leaving for David Bowie's band in 1978. That, along with Robert Calvert falling into clinical depression, led to Hawkwind breaking up in mid-tour.\nAlong with other Hawkwind members he guested on science fiction author Michael Moorcock's New Worlds Fair in 1975 and has also played on solo projects by former Hawkwind members Robert Calvert and Nik Turner.\nSince the 1970s, as well as cutting an album (Interesting Times) with Tony Hill under the High Tide banner and releasing several solo albums under his own name, House has twice rejoined  Hawkwind; between 1989 and 1991, and between 2001 and 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hawkwind", "response": ["Dik Mik departed during 1973 and Calvert ended his association with the band to concentrate on solo projects. Dettmar also indicated that he was to leave the band, so Simon House was recruited as keyboardist and violinist playing live shows, a North America tour and recording the 1974 album Hall of the Mountain Grill. Dettmar left after a European tour and emigrated to Canada, whilst Alan Powell deputised for an incapacitated King on that European tour, but remained giving the band two drummers.", "In 2005 a new album Take Me to Your Leader was released. Recorded by the core band of Brock/Davey/Chadwick, contributors included new keyboardist Jason Stuart, Arthur Brown, tabloid writer and TV personality Matthew Wright, 1970s New Wave singer Lene Lovich, Simon House and Jez Huggett.

One studio album Prophets of Time was released in 1994 followed by the live CD and DVD Space Ritual 1994 Live and another live CD Past or Future? in 1996.

Bowie composed \"Move On\" after accidentally playing his earlier composition \"All the Young Dudes\" backwards, then having Alomar write out the reversed chord sequence. \"Yassassin\" combines funk and reggae, using a violin played by Simon House to create a sound reminiscent of a Middle Eastern folk song and Turkish music. In part, the music of German band Neu! inspired \"Red Sails\", sharing their distinctive \"motorik\" drum beat; Pegg describes it as \"an upbeat slab of new wave pop\".

Rather than quickly delving deeply into loud rock music, the song was used to intentionally provoke the audience into a calm, holding them initially in deep suspense.

These versions had Bowie on Chamberlin, Simon House on electric violin (and a violin solo to replace the higher notes sung by Bowie on original recording), Roger Powell on synthesizers, Sean Mayes on grand piano and ARP Solina String Synthesizer, George Murray on bass guitar, Dennis Davis on cymbals and percussion with Carlos Alomar conducting the band and Adrian Belew looking on with his electric guitar turned down (waiting for his cue to begin \"Heroes\" the song that was played afterwards)."]}, {"page": "Stage (David Bowie album)", "response": ["The recording was culled from concerts in Philadelphia, Providence and Boston, US, in late April and early May 1978.
