Nisbet, was known as a reliable and careful scholar and usually provided a source if possible. In this case he cites a charter which he says was received by George Munro from the Earl of Sutherland during the reign of King Alexander II of Scotland. Nisbet claims the charter to have read as: Clarissimo & fidelissimo Confanguineo Georgio Munro de Foules. Unfortunately this charter cannot now be traced.George Munro, 5th Baron of Foulis also appears on the Munro family tree of 1734.Late 19th century author Alexander Mackenzie also mentions this George Munro. However, he states that George was merely a witness to this charter from William, Earl of Sutherland to the Archdeacon of Moray, dated 1232 -1237 and concludes that this confirms the tradition that Hugh Freskyn who was the grandfather of William, Earl of Sutherland bore the same relation to George Munro of Fowlis. However, Mackenzie only quotes Nisbet's work as a source, which has been mentioned above. Mackenzie gives the same charter reading provided by Nisbet, only the spelling of George differs: Clarissimo & fidelissimo Confanguineo Georgis Munro de Foules.Mackenzie goes on to say that George received all of his Ross-shire lands in a charter before 1249 during the reign of Alexander II and that George died in 1269, although this is not mentioned by Nisbet.\nGeorge was succeeded by his son Robert Munro, 6th Baron of Foulis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Munro", "response": ["* George Munro, 5th Baron of Foulis"]}, {"page": "Munro (surname)", "response": ["* George Munro, 5th Baron of Foulis (fl. 13th century), Scottish leader"]}, {"page": "Robert Munro, 6th Baron of Foulis", "response": ["Robert is said to have been the son of George Munro, 5th Baron of Foulis who he succeeded in 1269."]}, {"page": "Chiefs of Clan Munro", "response": ["| George Munro, 5th Baron of Foulis"]}, {"page": "Clan Munro", "response": ["According to the same traditional sources Donald Munro's grandson, Hugh Munro, was the first Munro to be authentically designated Baron of Foulis; he died in 1126. A reliable scholar, Alexander Nisbet, stated that George Munro, 5th Baron of Foulis received a charter from the Earl of Sutherland during the reign of Alexander II of Scotland, but this charter cannot be traced.;  However, George Martine of Clermont (1635\u20131712) reported that the founder was a brother of \u00c1ine Ni Cath\u00e1in, known to have married Aonghus \u00d3g Mac Domhnaill of Islay about 1300, both being children of C\u00fa Maighe na nGall \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in. \u00c1ine is said to have been accompanied, as part of her tocher (dowry), by many men of different surnames.  The genealogist and lexicographer David Kelley argues that if a brother of \u00c0ine, this places \"Donald\" in the late 13th century. Kelley also speculates that the \"Donald le fiz Kan\" granted \u00a310 per annum by the Treasury of Scotland in 1305, is the same man, with a Norman-Scots rendition of Domnall O'Cathain."]}]}}
