The previous year, Tom Crawford and Mike Witwer had attempted to organise an official race but it was cancelled when the insurance policy was rescinded. So the two of them ran the course, completing it in 70 hours and 27 minutes. After reading about it in the San Francisco Chronicle, Kenneth Crutchlow challenged Crawford and Witwer to a team race: Crutchlow and a partner, representing Britain, versus the American pair.  Crutchlow put an ad in Athletics Weekly to find a teammate and Eleanor Robinson, at the time considered the best female ultra runner in the world, was the only person to respond.
