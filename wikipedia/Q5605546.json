Playing as a winger, he often showed flashes of brilliance, including scoring one and supplying four other goals during a 5\u20133 win over Middlesbrough in May 1966. He eventually left the club in 1967 to sign for Bury. Farrell later went on to play in South Africa before retiring.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lynn Brewer", "response": ["A USA Today article by Greg Farrell, based on interviews with two dozen former colleagues, found that her claim to be a former Enron Executive and as the first whistleblower at Enron could not be substantiated. Her former colleagues described her claim as exaggerated. Former Enron employees claimed that she mainly did clerical work at Enron, and lost her job after failing to complete an assignment to teach a workshop in London.  According to USA Today, Brewer took advantage of her similarity to a real whistle-blower at Enron, Sherron Watkins. Brewer said that \"...we'd hope that all the time we're confused with her (Sherron Watkins).\""]}, {"page": "Farrell (surname)", "response": ["*Greg Farrell, Scottish footballer"]}]}}
