The petition led to his election being declared void, and his having to fight a further by-election in May 1833, which he won against the Whig contender Benjamin Wood, who had been the third placed candidate in the 1832 General Election.After fighting again to retain his seat at the General Election in February 1835, Kennedy left Parliament in July, \"Taking the Chiltern Hundreds\" and retiring conveniently at a time when Viscount Palmerston found himself without a seat in Parliament and forcing a by-election which Palmerston won comfortably. In Palmerston's Biography by K. Bourne it is reported that \"The impecunious Kennedy\" was paid \u00a32000 for vacating the seat. Kennedy was then appointed (by Palmerston) as a judge to the joint British and Spanish Mixed Court of Justice in Havana in post from 1837 to 1839.", "link_mentions": {}}}
