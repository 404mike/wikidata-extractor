Carter) and reflects how the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was trying to tie together two generations of musicians. Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was a young country-rock band with a hippie look. Acuff described them as \"a bunch of long-haired West Coast boys.\" The other players were much older and more famous from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, primarily as old-time country and bluegrass players. Many had become known to their generation through the Grand Ole Opry. However, with the rise of rock-and-roll, the emergence of the commercial country's slick 'Nashville Sound,' and changing tastes in music, their popularity had waned somewhat from their glory years.  Acuff was initially contemptuous of the project, but later relented and participated."]}, {"page": "Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)", "response": ["\"Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)\" is the title of a country/folk song reworked by A.
