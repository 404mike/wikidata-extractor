Around 1930 she and her partner Betty Scott set up the architectural practice of Aiton & Scott. Their best-known work is the office building for the Aiton & Company pipe manufacturing company in Derby. This was remarkable both as a striking early example of modernist industrial architecture and also as a building designed by two of the small number of women working in architecture at that time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1931 in architecture", "response": ["* Aiton & Co. factory office, Derby, England, designed by Norah Aiton and Betty Scott, completed."]}, {"page": "List of women architects", "response": ["* Norah Aiton (1903\u20131988), early modernist architect"]}]}}
