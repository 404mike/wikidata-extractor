Lucas lived, but spent the rest of his life with over 200 pieces of shrapnel in his body. In 2008 near Sangin in Afghanistan, British Royal Marine Matthew Croucher used his rucksack to pin the grenade to the floor; his body armor absorbed the majority of the blast. On November 21, 2010 in  Marjah, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Kyle Carpenter threw himself upon a grenade, thrown onto a rooftop, to save a fellow Marine, sustaining injuries to his face and right arm and losing his right eye; he survived these wounds. Despite these rare instances, however, the odds of survival are extremely slim. With modern medicine, however, odds are greatly increased when compared to falling on a grenade in the 20th century."]}, {"page": "Royal Marines Reserve", "response": ["In 2008, Royal Marine Reservist Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher received the George Cross for his actions whilst deployed with 40 Commando in Afghanistan.
