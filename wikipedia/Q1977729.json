The period during which pirates were most successful was from the 1660s to 1730s. Piracy flourished in the Caribbean because of the existence of pirate seaports such as Port Royal in Jamaica,Campo-Flores/ Arian, \"Yar, Mate! Swashbuckler Tours!,\" Newsweek 180, no. 6 (2002): 58.

'Jorge Bergoglio\u2019s radicalism comes from his willingness to go to the essentials, to pare back to the Gospel,' Ivereigh writes. Francis found his way to the essentials while putting in place the post-Vatican II spiritual renewal in his Jesuit order by focusing on 'poverty, holiness, missionary focus, obedience to the pope and unity.' During his time as provincial superior of the Society of Jesus in Argentina, he attempted to reorient a politically charged church culture toward the spirituality of everyday holiness.\""]}, {"page": "Cold War (TV series)", "response": ["The series was produced by Pat Mitchell and Jeremy Isaacs, who had earlier in 1973 produced the World War II documentary series The World at War  in a similar style.

He noted that Professor Michel Schooyans of the Catholic University of Leuven and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences \"accused Blair and his wife of supporting a messianic US plan for world domination.\" The criticism's focus was that the Foundation's approach amounted to reducing the religions to the same, predetermined common denominator. This meant \"stripping them of their identity\". Schooyans arguing that \"(t)his project threatens to set us back to an age in which political power was ascribed the mission of promoting a religious confession, or of changing it.

Around the same time, Irish journalist Hugh O'Shaughnessy accused HRW of using false and misleading information, saying that the report was \"put together with [a] sort of know-nothing Washington bias.\" Tom Porteous, Human Rights Watch's London director, said that O'Shaughnessy \"\u00a0... not only fails to provide any evidence for these allegations\", but \"\u00a0... more seriously, he misrepresents HRW's positions in his apparent determination to undermine our well earned international reputation for accuracy and impartiality.\""]}, {"page": "Andrew Morrison", "response": ["Fredrick Kissoon, Ricky Singh and Hugh O'Shaughnessy described him as a 'Symbol of courage' and one who went about living serenely amidst insecurity; an insecurity that had his co-workers quite nervous but was of no concern to him.
