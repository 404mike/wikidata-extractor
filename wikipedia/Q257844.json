Tchaikovsky himself remarked to fellow composer Sergei Taneyev upon the ingenuity of Sylvia, calling it \"... the first ballet, where the music constitutes not only the main, but the only interest. What charm, what elegance, what richness of melody, rhythm, harmony.\" While this statement may be a little hyperbolic, it says something very important about the uniqueness of the ballet. Sylvias score is varied and rich, and it stands out, drawing the focus from the sets, the dancers, the costumes. Instead of receding into the background, setting only the mood, Delibes' score sets the action. The music of Sylvia was also notable for its new, more developed use of leitmotifs.BalletNotes (2001). \"L\u00e9o Delibes\". Retrieved June 11, 2005. Such a stylistic choice is characteristic of Delibes, who was a great admirer of Wagner. Indeed, echoes of Wagner's influence are quite obvious in the music such as its \"symphonic\" nature, as described by Ivor Forbes Guest in the 1954 edition of The Ballet Annual."]}, {"page": "Guest (surname)", "response": ["*Ann Hutchinson Guest (born 1918), authority on dance notation and wife of Ivor Forbes Guest"]}, {"page": "List of members of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres", "response": ["|Ivor Forbes Guest|| style=\"background:#c96;\"|Chevalier||2000"]}, {"page": "Ivor Guest", "response": ["*Ivor Forbes Guest (1920\u20132018), British lawyer and ballet historian, husband of movement notation expert Ann Hutchinson Guest", "*Ivor Guest (died 1917), elder brother of Ernest Lucas Guest and uncle of Ivor Forbes Guest"]}, {"page": "Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award", "response": ["*1991 - Ivor Forbes Guest"]}, {"page": "Guest, Ivor Forbes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ivor Forbes Guest "]}, {"page": "April 1920", "response": ["*Born: Ivor Forbes Guest, British chairman of the Royal Academy of Dance from 1970 to 1993; in Chislehurst, London (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "Herbert Melville Guest", "response": ["Guest's two youngest sons, Cecil Marmaduke (1888\u20131954), known as Duke, and Oliver Basil (born 1891), served in the Transvaal Scottish in the First World War.
