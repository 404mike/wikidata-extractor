Moody had already vastly improved the efficacy of the Colonial Office in London: he had improved the efficacy of the annual Blue Books, which had been introduced in 1821, and introduced, as his own invention, new Brown Books in which further statistical information from every colony was entered every six months for perusal by the London Colonial Office. The subjects of the analyses composed by Moody for the Colonial Office included, 'The duties and means of increasing the utility of naval officers in the West Indies'; the history of the Crown Estates of Berbice; and the conditions of labour on the sugar plantations of the West Indies'. Moody was employed to compose works of journalism - under the pseudonym 'Vindex', which was also used by others in the Colonial Office - that justified the Government's West Indian policy: these works included the 1825, Considerations in Defence of the Orders in Council for the Melioration of Slavery in Trinidad, the copy of which presently in the library of the Royal Commonwealth Society was formerly in the Colonial Office. Historian D. J. Murray provides a synopsis of Moody's contribution to the London Colonial Office prior to Moody's appointment to the Commission on Slavery: 'He [Moody] helped to provide an understanding in the Office of problems the existence of which was barely comprehended, [and] he raised fundamental questions and explained the wider implications of the Government's course of action'. Moody considered his function to be to identify factual evidence that would enable Lord Bathurst and Wilmot Horton to make accurate decisions, and Moody was contemptuous of the prevalence of unproven assertions in sociopolitical discourse: Moody wrote, on 3 July 1826, 'It is of infinitely great importance for Lord Bathurst to have laid before him clear statements of facts rather than mere opinions... It is so much easier to give an opinion than to describe carefully and accurately a tedious series of facts. It is, however, from these facts only that Lord Bathurst can form his own principles practically to guide his judgment'. Moody contention that only factual evidence could be a valid determiner of a practice, and that opinion was to be rejected, was common to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 James Stephen.", "colonial empire: Parliament declared Moody's \u2018great experience in the control of labour, both slave and free, both African and European, in garrison, and in the field\u2019, and his notions were highly influential in London society in its entirety. Moody was incorporated in diverse factions of the London establishment. Inside the Colonial Office, Moody had 'all its archives open to him'. Moody was a friend of the geographer James Macqueen, to whom he provided inside information, which Macqueen would not disclose, throughout the period 1824 - 1828. Moody was a member of the Political Economy Club, at which he disputed with both James Mill and John Ramsay McCulloch, and at which he stated his admiration for the philosophy of Jean-Baptiste Say. Moody maintained an extensive private correspondence with Sir Robert Wilmot Horton, (after whom he named one of his sons), and another with Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham (after whom he named another of his sons), before he returned to the West Indies. In the City of London, Moody was an Advisor to the East India Company; a Director of the Crown Life Assurance Company, of 33 Bridge Street, Blackfriars; and a Director of the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company, of 5 Copthall Court, City of London. Subsequent to the publication of his reports, Moody became increasingly close to James Mangles, the Director of the East India Company, to whom he subsequently proffered advice regarding the settlement of the Swan River Colony at minimal cost to the British Government. However, Moody's report provoked the Whigs, evangelicals, and abolitionists to ire. Zachary Macaulay and other abolitionists condemned Moody's philosophy in the Anti-Slavery Reporter, and Lord Macaulay cited Moody's reports in an anti-slavery essay that was published in the Edinburgh Review in 1827. Moody's contentions and his style of expression were condemned by Lord Macaulay,Thomas Babington Macaulay, Social and Industrial Capacities of the Negroes (Edinburgh Review, March 1827), collected in Critical, Historical and Miscellaneous Essays, Volume 6 (1860), pp.361\u2013404. and in a series of anonymous letters to the Morning Chronicle newspaper, all which provoked extensive defensive refutations from Moody. Throughout the period in which London political society responded to his reports, Moody maintained a continuous dialogue with the Colonial Office, in which he vigorously refuted the criticisms of his reports, and repudiated the doctrines of his critics in private correspondences and in the newspapers. Moody's friends Sir Robert Wilmot Horton and Thomas Hyde Villiers MP also wrote articles - under the pseudonym 'Vindex', which Moody had also used - to The Star newspaper, in which they refuted the objections that others had made to Moody's philosophy and defended Government policy. Moody proceeded to testify before the Privy Council, in defence of Government policy, in 1827 and in 1828. Moody's report influenced Lord Bathurst; Moody's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 James Stephen; and Moody's successor Sir Henry Taylor. Historian D. J. Murray contends that Hyde Villiers and Taylor were merely advisors, and not experts like Moody and Stephen.
