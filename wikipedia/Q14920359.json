She said: \"It's not just the suffering they endure in the laboratories and research establishments. Just getting there can be torture. Studies of primates show them to have complex mental abilities which may increase their capacity to suffer. Supplying the laboratories in the UK imposes huge suffering on the animals... They're then contained in small, single cages, and transported for very long distances causing deaths, distress and suffering.\""]}, {"page": "John Clare (Journalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Clare (journalist) "]}, {"page": "John Clare (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Clare (1793\u20131864) was an English poet", "John Clare may also refer to:", "*John Clare (journalist) (born 1955), English author and journalist", "*John Clare (soccer), American soccer coach", "*John Clare Billing (1866\u20131955), English organist and composer", "*John Clare Whitehorn (1894\u20131974), American psychiatric educator"]}]}}
