Born in Australia, Croft moved to England at a young age and was educated there. He moved to Canada in 1883 and became involved in logging, purchasing the sawmill in Chemainus. Croft rose in prominence through his running of the mill, and further enhanced his standing by marrying a daughter of Robert Dunsmuir, a prominent industrialist on Vancouver Island. Croft was elected to the British Columbia Legislature in 1886, representing Cowichan, serving until 1894. He later became involved in mining on Mount Sicker, and founded the town of Crofton, British Columbia in 1902 as a place to house the smelter for mining. Croft is featured on the Netflix series Haunted (Season 3 Episode 2) wherein a family claims to have been haunted by his ghost.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crofton, British Columbia", "response": ["left|160px|thumb|Henry Croft, founder of Crofton", "In 1900, Henry Croft purchased land at Osborne Bay for a smelter and townsite. The next year, the Northwestern Smelting and Refining Co. began construction. In 1902, the village was established, the smelter opened, and Croft extended the Lenora Mt. Sicker Railway from his copper mine to Crofton. Mining ceased in late 1902 when the company went into receivership. Having exhausted other ore supplies, the smelter closed in 1903. In 1906, the Britannia Mining & Smelting Company bought the smelter. Following plummeting copper prices during the Panic of 1907, the smelter closed in January 1908. Rumours of a large sawmill to be built came to nothing, and when Henry Croft died in 1917, his namesake was struggling to survive."]}, {"page": "1886 British Columbia general election", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|Henry Croft"]}, {"page": "1890 British Columbia general election", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|Henry Croft"]}, {"page": "Croft (surname)", "response": ["*Henry Croft, Australian-Canadian businessman"]}, {"page": "Mount Sicker", "response": ["In fall 1897, Harry Smith established the Lenora, Mt.

Vancouver Island, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, has considerable deposits of minerals, notably coal and copper. In the late 19th century, the abundance of copper led to a large industry, with many entrepreneurs trying to get a large stake. Many communities were established as a result of the need to export the mineral, notably Crofton, which was the site of a smelter set up by Henry Croft. Nearly all the ore that came out of Mt. Sicker, which reached several hundred tons per day at its peak, was carted to the small town, processed, and shipped away."]}, {"page": "University of Toronto", "response": ["Under Strachan's stewardship, King's College was a religious institution closely aligned with the Church of England and the British colonial elite, known as the Family Compact. Reformist politicians opposed the clergy's control over colonial institutions and fought to have the college secularized. In 1849, after a lengthy and heated debate, the newly elected responsible government of the Province of Canada voted to rename King's College as the University of Toronto and severed the school's ties with the church. Having anticipated this decision, the enraged Strachan had resigned a year earlier to open Trinity College as a private Anglican seminary. University College was created as the nondenominational teaching branch of the University of Toronto. During the American Civil War, the threat of Union blockade on British North America  prompted the creation of the University Rifle Corps, which saw battle in resisting the Fenian raids on the Niagara border in 1866. The Corps was part of the Reserve Militia led by Professor Henry Croft."]}, {"page": "Leonora and Mt.
