She began singing in his concerts.  May and Allen began to have a relationship, and she travelled with him to Australia in 1870, where they performed together in concerts.  Beginning in 1872, May began star in comic operas in Australia.   May and Allen returned to England in 1876, where she continued to perform in Offenbach works, earning good notices.\nIn 1877, May created the role of Aline in The Sorcerer, earning warm reviews, but she left the company after only two months.  She quickly returned to Offenbach in London under the management of Richard D'Oyly Carte and, by 1882, she was touring with Emily Soldene's opera company.  She split up with Allen and moved to the U.S. in 1883, where she performed first in New York but soon joined Charles Ford's Opera Company in St. Louis and on tour.  The next year, she married Louis Raymond, another member of the company.  She was earning good notices, but she began to miss performances due to her growing struggle with alcoholism.  She continued to perform on tour until 1887, when she became ill and died at the age of 40.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Orpheus in the Underworld", "response": ["The first New York production was at the Stadt Theater, in German, in March 1861; the production ran until February 1862.
