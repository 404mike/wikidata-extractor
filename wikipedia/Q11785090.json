Due to his decision to publish anonymously, to the end of his life he was able to travel freely between his family manor in Russian-controlled lands and centers of Polish emigr\u00e9 life in Western Europe (the Great Emigration), while others, including Mickiewicz and S\u0142owacki, were forced to remain in exile in the West, banned from returning to Polish lands by the occupying powers.

Over a century after the play was first published,  writing in 1959 for The Polish Review called it a \"masterpiece of Polish drama\". Shortly afterward, Polish writer and Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz in his 1969 book The History of Polish Literature called this work \"truly pioneering\" and \"undoubtedly a masterpiece not only of Polish but also of world literature\". Mi\u0142osz notes that it is uprising such a brilliant work was created by an author who was barely out of his teens. Gordon M. Wickstrom in 1972 writing for the Educational Theatre Journal called it \"the finest achievement of Polish Romantic drama\". Robert Mann in 1983 in the Slavic and East European Journal noted that it \"ranks alongside Mickiewicz's Forefather's Eve and S\u0142owacki's Kordian as one of the greatest dramatic works in Polish Romantic literature. In 1986 Frank Northen Magill in the Critical Survey of Drama: Authors wrote that \"The Undivine Comedy... suffices to ensure Krasi\u0144ski's position as a dramatist of international stature\". Writing for the same journal as Mann in 1997, Megan L. Dixon described the work as \"a classic of 19th-century High Romanticism... worthy of comparison to Goethe or Byron\". Gerard T. Kapolka in 2000 in The Polish Review referred to it as a \"great play\". Halina Flory\u0144ska-Lalewicz, in her biography of Krasi\u0144ski (published in 2004 at Culture.pl), calls it an outstanding example of Romantic metaphysical drama. Harold B. Segel, in Polish Romantic Drama: Three Plays in English Translation (2014), remarks that \"the play has steadily gained prestige in the twentieth century and is widely regarded in contemporary Poland as one of the greatest dramatic works to emerge from the Romantic period.\""]}]}}
