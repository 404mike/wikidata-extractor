By partnering with record labels like Warner Music or media publishers like Vice,  the winning artists were offered records deals and media publicity. In 2006, the project was broadcast live on Channel 4 in Great Britain and featured legendary avant-garde rock band Roxy Music. In 2009, the project included a global tour and radio station. The tour featured live performances by artists like Kanye West and The Roots, who supported the competition's winning younger bands, The Terror Pigeon Dance Revolt! and HEARTSREVOLUTION. Produced in London, the Diesel:U:Music radio station was hailed by The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph for its unique quality programming, and had shows hosted by everyone from Grandmaster Flash to Franz Ferdinand.
