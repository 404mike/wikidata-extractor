These scholars argue that Marx equated Judaism with capitalism in his essay, helping to spread that idea. Some further argue that the essay influenced National Socialist, as well as Soviet and Arab antisemites.According to Joshua Muravchik Marx's aspiration for \"the emancipation of society from Judaism\" because \"the practical Jewish spirit\" of \"huckstering\" had taken over the Christian nations is not that far from the Nazi program's twenty-four-point: \"combat[ing] the Jewish-materialist spirit within us and without us\" in order \"that our nation can [\u2026] achieve permanent health.\" See  Marx himself had Jewish ancestry, and Albert Lindemann and Hyam Maccoby have suggested that he was embarrassed by it.Lindemann, Albert S. Modern Anti-Semitism and the Rise of the Jews. Cambridge University Press, 2000. , . p. 166. Others argue that Marx consistently supported Prussian Jewish communities' struggles to achieve equal political rights. These scholars argue that \"On the Jewish Question\" is a critique of Bruno Bauer's arguments that Jews must convert to Christianity before being emancipated, and is more generally a critique of liberal rights discourses and capitalism.David McLellan: Marx before Marxism (1970), pp. 141\u2013142"]}, {"page": "Antisemitism in Christianity", "response": ["Mainstream Talmudic Rabbinical Judaism today directly descends from the Pharisees whom Jesus often criticized.Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (1943); Jewish Encyclopedia (1905), Exhibit 264.

Jewish Christianity became dispersed throughout the Jewish diaspora in the Levant, where it was slowly eclipsed by Gentile Christianity, which then spread throughout the Roman Empire without competition from Jewish Christian sects. Once the Jerusalem church was eliminated during the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135, the Ebionites gradually lost influence and followers. Some modern scholars, such as Hyam Maccoby, argue the decline of the Ebionites was due to marginalization and persecution by both Jews and Christians. Following the defeat of the rebellion and the expulsion of Jews from Judea, Jerusalem became the Gentile city of Aelia Capitolina. Many of the Jewish Christians residing at Pella renounced their Jewish practices at this time and joined to the mainstream Christian church. Those who remained at Pella and continued in obedience to the Law were labeled heretics.
