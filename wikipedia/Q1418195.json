His first research was with Edward Forbes conducting dredging in the Irish Sea. Other participants were Robert MacAndrew, John Gwyn Jeffreys, the Yoxford, Suffolk shell collector George Barlee (1794-1861) and his fellow Irishmen Robert Ball, Edmund Getty and George Crawford Hyndman. In 1835 he travelled in France, Switzerland and Germany with Forbes. Then in 1841 he joined Forbes and Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt on the Beacon commanded by Thomas Graves and working in the Mediterranean and Aegean. The expedition lasted eighteen months and conducted more than one hundred dredging operations at depths varying from 1 to 130 fathoms, as well as shore-based studies.Forbes E. (1844).

Webb, Jr.", "response": ["While a student at Vanderbilt in 1896, Webb and three other friends built a nine-hole golf course in a field adjacent to the Vanderbilt campus where University School now stands. Cattle grazed there and kept the grass low so the course didn't need mowing. Webb said there was no golf equipment available for purchase in Nashville at the time. The boys had gutta-percha balls and clubs with hickory shafts obtained by mail order; buried tomato cans were the holes. Prominent Nashvillians, some of whom had built similar links on their own property, became interested in golf and decided to form formed a golf-based club. They eventually purchased the Whitworth Estate near the intersection of Harding Road and Bowling Avenue and formed the \"Nashville Golf and Country club\" on April 9, 1901. They built a clubhouse with its carriage entrance on what is now Golf Club Lane. The Nashville streetcar came west out of downtown on what is now West End Avenue and ended at 29th Street; from there a mule-drawn wagon carried club members through a toll gate at Murphy Road to get to the clubhouse. The streetcar line was extended 1n 1911 to reach the club. They hired a Scottish golf pro named Robert MacAndrew (who later competed in the 1904 U.S. Open) to design a golf course rivaling the quality of those in Scotland."]}, {"page": "MacAndrew, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert MacAndrew"]}]}}
