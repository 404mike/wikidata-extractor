His research contributed to laying the foundations of much modern consumer electronic technology.Tony Orchard was born in Carmarthen, Wales, and moved to Swansea. He studied Chemistry first at Wadham College, Oxford as an undergraduate and then towards a DPhil doctoral degree in theoretical inorganic chemistry at Merton College, Oxford. He left Merton College before he had completed his doctorate at the age of 26 to become a Fellow in Inorganic Chemistry at University College in Oxford. He stayed at University College until his death.\nDuring the 1970s, Orchard led a group of researchers working in the area of photoelectron spectroscopy. This enabled scientists to examine the electronic structure of materials. The research was important for technological innovations in modern electronics, helping with the development of advances such as the personal computer and mobile phone. He published the book Magnetochemistry in 2003.As well as his research contributions, Orchard also helped to improve the system of undergraduate applications for chemistry at Oxford University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chemists", "response": ["*Tony Orchard (1941\u20132005), British inorganic chemist, photoelectron spectroscopist"]}, {"page": "List of British scientists", "response": ["* Tony Orchard (1941\u20132005) inorganic chemist."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Merton College, Oxford", "response": ["*Tony Orchard, inorganic chemist (as a graduate)"]}, {"page": "List of Wadham College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Tony Orchard, inorganic chemist"]}, {"page": "Orchard (surname)", "response": ["*Tony Orchard (1941\u20132005), British inorganic chemist"]}, {"page": "Anthony Frederick Orchard", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Orchard"]}, {"page": "A.
