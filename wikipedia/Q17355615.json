Her Phantasmagoria, containing poetry and prose, Letters to the Young and The Three Histories were highly popular. While bringing up brothers and sisters, she wrote for the Manchester Gazette in 1821. She also developed friendships with many authors. Her religious advice tended to dogmatism and a feeling of Christian right. Phantasmagoria was noticed by William Wordsworth and Dorothy, whom she visited in Lancashire. Other friends were Felicia Hemans, with whom she stayed in Wales in summer 1828, Barbara Hofland, Sara Coleridge, the Henry Roscoes, the Charles Wentworth Dilkes, the Samuel Carter Halls, the Henry Chorleys, and Thomas De Quincey. Through its editor Dilke, she began writing for the Athenaeum in 1830. She married Rev. William Kew Fletcher (died 1867) in 1832, at Penegoes, Montgomeryshire. They sailed for India, but she kept up a journal and had poetry printed in the Athenaeum as The Oceanides.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 25", "response": ["*1800 \u2013 Maria Jane Jewsbury, English writer, poet, literary reviewer (d. 1833)"]}, {"page": "1833", "response": ["* October 4 \u2013 Maria Jane Jewsbury, English poet and literary reviewer (b. 1800)"]}, {"page": "Maria (given name)", "response": ["* Maria Jane Jewsbury (1800\u20131833), English writer, poet, literary reviewer"]}, {"page": "1833 in literature", "response": ["*October 4 \u2013 Maria Jane Jewsbury (Fletcher), English writer, poet and reviewer, dies in India (born 1800)"]}, {"page": "1800 in literature", "response": ["**Maria Jane Jewsbury, English writer, poet and reviewer (died 1833)"]}, {"page": "Measham", "response": ["*Maria Jane Jewsbury (1800\u20131833), a woman of letters, was born in Measham, as was her novelist sister Geraldine Jewsbury (1812\u20131880)."]}, {"page": "Phantasmagoria", "response": ["Maria Jane Jewsbury produced a volume entitled Phantasmagoria, or Sketches of Life and Literature, published by Hurst Robinson & Co, in 1825.

This collection contains around 10,000 items dating from the tenth century to the present, covering literature, religion, and the history of the book, and includes nearly 1,300 bibles. The Reed Collection's illuminated medieval manuscripts are considered one of the most outstanding assemblies of European visual art from the Middle Ages in Australasia. Reed had a personal fancy for autograph letters, many of which were bought in miscellaneous lots from London-based booksellers including Edward Friehold. The collection now boasts 5,200 autograph letters dating predominantly to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by literary, aristocratic, political and religious figures, and has been the subject of international scholarly attention. Of particular note, 41 previously unpublished letters in the Reed Collection form the core of In Her Hand, a 2013 collection that includes transcriptions, annotations, and discussions of letters by noted Romantic-era writers including Anna Barbauld, Felicia Hemans, Hannah More, Amelia Opie, and Maria Jane Jewsbury."]}, {"page": "Dora Wordsworth", "response": ["Throughout her life, Wordsworth formed intense romantic attachments to both men and women, the most significant being her friendship with Maria Jane Jewsbury.

In 1823 he exhibited at the royal academy Don Quixote in his Study, the first of the subject-pictures drawn from poetry or romance with which his name was subsequently identified. It was followed by M. de Pourceaugnac, or the Patient in Spite of Himself (1824), The Dull Lecture (1825), and Captain Macheath upbraided by Polly and Lucy (1826); this last picture was purchased by the Marquis of Lansdowne, who also collected at Bowood The Vicar of Wakefield reconciling his Wife to Olivia (1828) and Polly Peachum. Two pictures, The Forsaken and The Lover's Quarrel, were engraved in The Literary Souvenir for 1826; the first with verses by Letitia Elizabeth Landon and the second with an accompanying unsigned story, later attributed to Maria Jane Jewsbury; this latter was in the Dover House collection, and, with The Adieu and another picture by Newton, was sold at Christie's on 6 May 1893.

She edited a new edition (the 64th) of Maria Rundell's cookery book A New System of Domestic Cookery, and also a book of poetry by her friend Letitia Landon. But by 1839 she decided to return to India, not simply by sailing directly, but by crossing overland from France, through Egypt to Suez, and then by ship to Bombay. She went with only a female friend and took only two months to complete her journey, arriving at the end of October. This was a similar journey to that made by Anne Elwood, who thought Roberts's journey too quick. Roberts wrote a book about her journey. In India she returned to editing, the Bombay Gazette being one title, but died suddenly in September 1840 and was buried near the grave of Maria Jane Jewsbury."]}, {"page": "Jewsbury", "response": ["*Maria Jane Jewsbury (1800\u20131833), English novelist"]}, {"page": "Maria Jane Fletcher", "response": ["#REDIRECT Maria Jane Jewsbury"]}, {"page": "Victory (1816 ship)", "response": ["In September 1832, Victory, Biden, master carried Maria Jane Jewsbury, an English writer, poet and reviewer, to India."]}]}}
