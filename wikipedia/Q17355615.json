Her Phantasmagoria, containing poetry and prose, Letters to the Young and The Three Histories were highly popular. While bringing up brothers and sisters, she wrote for the Manchester Gazette in 1821. She also developed friendships with many authors. Her religious advice tended to dogmatism and a feeling of Christian right. Phantasmagoria was noticed by William Wordsworth and Dorothy, whom she visited in Lancashire. Other friends were Felicia Hemans, with whom she stayed in Wales in summer 1828, Barbara Hofland, Sara Coleridge, the Henry Roscoes, the Charles Wentworth Dilkes, the Samuel Carter Halls, the Henry Chorleys, and Thomas De Quincey. Through its editor Dilke, she began writing for the Athenaeum in 1830. She married Rev. William Kew Fletcher (died 1867) in 1832, at Penegoes, Montgomeryshire. They sailed for India, but she kept up a journal and had poetry printed in the Athenaeum as The Oceanides.", "link_mentions": {}}}
