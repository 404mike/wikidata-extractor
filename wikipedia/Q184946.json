He was one of a number of players who left West Ham in the summer of 2003, after the club had been relegated to the Football League First Division, with Cole signing for Chelsea. He spent seven seasons at Chelsea, playing over 280 games in all competitions and winning seven trophies, including three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a League Cup. He left Chelsea on a free transfer in July 2010 to join Liverpool, who a year later loaned him to Lille. After a season in France, he returned to Liverpool before re-joining West Ham in January 2013. He signed for Aston Villa in June 2014, then joined Coventry City on loan in October 2015, joining on a permanent deal in January 2016. This was to be his last club in England.\nCapped by England at under-16, under-18 and under-21 level, Cole was a full international between 2001 and 2010, capped by the England national team on 56 occasions, scoring 10 goals.

These have included serious renditions of theatre and movie classics such as \"The Bells are Ringing,\" along with more pun-laden or humorous efforts, such as chanting former player Paolo Di Canio's name to the canzone \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" by Giuseppe Verdi, or D.I. Canio to the tune of Ottawan's \"D.I.S.C.O.\", or the chant of \"Who Let The Potts Out?\" to the tune of Baha Men's \"Who Let the Dogs Out?\" when Steve Potts could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career, or \"That's Zamora\" to the tune of Dean Martin's 1953 \"That's Amore\" in honour of former striker Bobby Zamora.

Most recently, the likes of first teamers Mark Noble and James Tomkins, as well as Welsh international Jack Collison, have emerged through the . Frustratingly for fans and managers alike, the club has struggled to retain many of these players due to (predominantly) financial reasons.
