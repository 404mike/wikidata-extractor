In 1972 he was deselected as a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln, so he left the Labour Party and resigned his seat, forcing a by-election which he won.Taverne's 1973 victory in Lincoln was short-lived; despite retaining his seat at the February 1974 general election, Labour regained the seat at the October 1974 general election, by the future cabinet minister Margaret Beckett. However, his success opened the possibility of a realignment on the left of British politics, which took shape in 1981 as the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which Taverne joined. He later joined the Liberal Democrats when the SDP merged with the Liberal Party. He has sat as a Liberal Democrat life peer since 1996.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 18", "response": ["*  1928   \u2013 Dick Taverne, English lawyer and politician"]}, {"page": "Roy Jenkins", "response": ["Jenkins' supporters in the Parliamentary Labour Party became known as the \"Jenkinsites\".
