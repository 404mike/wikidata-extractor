The list is by season, this being the season in which the player's name first appears in surviving sources.\nCricket underwent radical changes during the 18th century. Patronage and popular support enabled it to outgrow its roots as a village pastime and develop into a major sport. In the early 1760s, pitched delivery bowling was introduced and this necessitated the invention of the straight bat: an evolution in bowling and batting techniques that radically changed cricket.\nThe earliest known scorecards date from 1744 but it was not until 1772 that they began to be completed and are preserved on a regular basis.\n\n", "link_mentions": []}}
