Despite losing his captaincy in the early part of the season to Luke Oliver, Henry regained the position as club captain later that season. Henry had started the campaign in a central midfield role, reverting to the role of full-back following Stevenage's poor start to the season. Henry scored his first league goal for Stevenage on 3 April 2007, in a 2\u20131 home defeat against Kidderminster Harriers. Henry became the first player to lift a trophy at the new Wembley Stadium; after Stevenage beat Kidderminster Harriers 3\u20132 in the 2007 FA Trophy Final on 12 May 2007.

Following the re-appointment of Westley as manager, Henry signed a new contract at Stevenage and played regularly at right-back during the 2008\u201309 season, making 52 appearances.
