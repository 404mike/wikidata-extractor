On account of the determination he showed in the matter, journalist and political commentator Andrew Marr described him as Thatcher's \"knight in shining gold braid\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Falklands War", "response": ["The following day, during a crisis meeting headed by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Henry Leach, advised them that \"Britain could and should send a task force if the islands are invaded\". On 1 April, Leach sent orders to a Royal Navy force carrying out exercises in the Mediterranean to prepare to sail south. Following the invasion on 2 April, after an emergency meeting of the cabinet, approval was given to form a task force to retake the islands. This was backed in an emergency session of the House of Commons the next day."]}, {"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["The three separate service ministries (Admiralty, War and Air) had merged into a single Ministry of Defence in 1981. Heseltine drew up plans on a flight back from Kuwait to merge the services further, so that the three chiefs of staff reported directly to the Chief of Defence Staff instead of being treated as colleagues, whilst some supply services were to be merged. The plans were bounced onto the Chief of Defence Staff, Field Marshal \"Dwin\" Bramall, over a weekend before publication on Monday, so senior officers had minimal time to drum up opposition in Parliament and the press. There was around three months of protest in the press, including from Bramall's predecessor Admiral of the Fleet Sir Henry Leach. Bramall obtained the concession that the individual service chiefs would be allowed to retain small staffs of their own and have a right of appeal to the Prime Minister. The changes took effect at the start of 1985.Crick 1997, pp, 253-5."]}, {"page": "Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)", "response": ["|  ||  || Leach HenrySir Henry Leach || 1923 ||  2011  || First Sea Lord 1979\u20131982||"]}, {"page": "HMS Javelin (F61)", "response": ["*Henry Leach (navigating officer during mutiny; more details at Leach biographic article)"]}, {"page": "HMS Mauritius (80)", "response": ["The future Admiral of the Fleet Henry Leach served as a midshipman aboard Mauritius during this time."]}, {"page": "HMS Galatea (F18)", "response": ["Notable commanding officers include Henry Leach from 1965 to 1967 Royal Navy Senior Appointments, Colin Mackie and Anthony (Tony) John Cooke between 1969 and 1971."]}, {"page": "HMNB Portsmouth", "response": ["In 1836 the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth was given accommodation within the Dockyard (in Admiralty House) and in 1889 he was given HMS Victory to be his ceremonial flagship.

The latter continued (as Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command) to fly his flag from HMS Victory (the oldest commissioned warship in the world) until 2012.
