During the first decades of the 20th Century, the common idiom \"to beat all around the mulberry bush\" meant to avoid speaking of a difficult topic by taking far longer to refer to it obliquely, in the hopes of not giving offense.See https://www.google.com/books/edition/Extension_of_Bituminous_Coal_Act_of_1937/cqH-BSSOsA0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22all+around+the+mulberry+bush%22&pg=PA626&printsec=frontcover: \"When a question is asked of you, and you refuse to answer, and then you beat all around the mulberry bush for five minutes, and then you say you do not know, I say that is ridiculous.\" In 1938, a song called \"Stop Beatin' Round the Mulberry Bush\", with lyrics by Bickley Reichner and music by Clay Boland and built around the basic melody of the nursery rhyme, was popular with recordings by bands such as Fats Waller, Count Basie, Jack Hylton, Nat Gonella, and Joe Loss.

Billy Cotton had perhaps the longest fame, as he still had a prime-time TV programme until the late '60s. The fame of Ted Heath lasted until 1964. Fans tended to divide them into \"Sweet\" (Ambrose, Geraldo and Victor Silvester) and \"Hot\" (Harry Roy and Nat Gonella).

Their objectives were originally more self-indulgent in nature, being privileged with wealth and German heritage, they spent their money on expensive clothing and liquor. The British musicologist Ralph Willett wrote that the Swing Youth wanted to emulate \"the cool, languid demeanour\" of British and American film stars.Willett, Ralph; \"Hot Swing and the Dissolute Life: Youth, Style and Popular Music in Europe 1939-49\", pp. 157\u2013163, Popular Music, Volume 8, No. 2, May 1989, p. 159. When the restrictions on jazz became law, their pastime would become a political statement, setting them in clear opposition to the Nazi Party.Kater, M. H. (2004). Hitler Youth. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press.  German musicologist Guido Fackler described the Swingjugend embrace of American music and the \"English style\" in clothing as reflecting the fact that: The Swingjugend rejected the Nazi state, above all because of its ideology and uniformity, its militarism, the 'F\u00fchrer principle' and the leveling Volksgemeinschaft (people's community). They experienced a massive restriction of their personal freedom. They rebelled against all this with jazz and swing, which stood for a love of life, self-determination, non-conformism, freedom, independence, liberalism, and internationalism. Reflecting their Anglophilia, the Swing Youth preferred to speak to each other in English rather than German as English was felt to be more \"cool\", a choice of language that vexed the authorities greatly.Peukert, Detlev Inside Nazi Germany, London: B. T. Batsford, 1987, p. 167. English together with French were languages widely taught in Gymnasium (high schools intended as preparation for university) since the early 20th century in the case of the former and since the 18th century in the case of the latter, so any German teenager who attended a Gymnasium could speak at least some French and English. As the Swing Youth were Anglophiles, they often tried to speak and write in the \"English style\". One \"swing boy\", in a 1940 letter written in slightly broken English to a friend who was going to Hamburg, stated: \"Be a proper spokesmen for Kiel, won't you? i.e, make sure you're really casual, singing or whistling English hits all the time, absolutely smashed and always surrounded by really amazing women\". Hamburg, the most Anglophile of German cities, was regarded as the \"capital\" of the Swing Youth, and British jazz players like Jack Hylton and Nat Gonella were popular with the Swing Youth, through Willet wrote that they \"... were sufficiently sophisticated to appreciate the superiority of the American artists as well as the stylish and sensuous qualities of their performances.\" The Swing Youth were also Americanophiles as many took monikers like Alaska Bill or Texas Jack and their clubs had such names like die Harlem club, die OK Gang club, and die Cotton club."]}, {"page": "British jazz", "response": ["By the early 1930s, music journalism in Britain, notably through the Melody Maker, had created an appreciation of the importance of the leading American jazz soloists and was beginning to recognise the improvising talents of some local musicians. During the 1930s most British jazz musicians made their living in dance bands of various kinds. Jazz became more important, and more separate as its own genre. Louis Armstrong played residencies in London and Glasgow in 1932, followed in subsequent years by the Duke Ellington Orchestra and Coleman Hawkins. But local jazz culture was limited to London where: \"jazz was played after hours in a couple of restaurants that encouraged musicians to come in and jam for drinks\"., p. 250. The groups of Nat Gonella and Spike Hughes gained a profile within Britain early in the decade; Hughes was even invited to New York to arrange, compose and lead what, in effect, was Benny Carter's Orchestra of the time. Carter himself worked in London for the BBC in 1936.
