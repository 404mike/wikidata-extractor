It lists basic information about 93 finite simple groups, the information being generally: its order, Schur multiplier, outer automorphism group, various constructions (such as presentations), conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups (with characters group action they define), and, most importantly, character tables (including power maps on the conjugacy classes) of the group itself and bicyclic extensions given by stem extensions and automorphism groups.  In certain cases (such as for the Chevalley groups E_n(2)), the character table is not listed and only basic information is given."]}]}}
