Stephenson dominated the inexperienced Colin Green and won corners from which Ipswich scored through a Phillips shot and a Moran header.  Although Roy Vernon had scored for Everton, Ipswich's  third goal came after Green fouled Stephenson, whose resulting free kick was converted by Elsworthy.  Crawford made it 4\u20131 from a fine angle before Brian Harris scored a consolation, ending the match 4\u20132.  The following week, Ipswich were at Craven Cottage where they faced Fulham.  Alan Mullery put the home side ahead after 13 minutes as they dominated the early stages, but injuries to Graham Leggat and Johnny Haynes weakened the team allowing Ipswich to take advantage.  Stephenson equalised and Crawford scored the winner with twelve minutes to go, with Ipswich taking the points with a 2\u20131 victory.  After a two-week break, Ipswich faced West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground on 24 February.  Described by Pawson in The Observer as a \"curiously relaxed and gentle game\", John Dick put the home side ahead before Leadbetter equalised with a rebound from a Crawford header which struck the West Ham crossbar.  Bailey spilled Joe Kirkup's strike into his own net to give West Ham the lead once again before a penalty from Phillips secured a 2\u20132 draw.  The month ended with Ipswich in third place in the First Division, four points behind Burnley who had a single game in hand."]}]}}
