In 1969, she met and married Tony Finch, son of the potter Ray Finch.  He worked for the Forestry Commission around the world and Lucy travelled with him, working as a nurse in Britain, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.  In 1997, while her husband was based in Kampala, Lucy Finch began volunteering at Hospice Africa Uganda, where she worked with Dr Anne Merriman in her pioneering, palliative care programme.  A year later, she returned to Malawi to nurse her sister, who was dying of HIV-related meningitis.  In the same hospital, a young man was dying in great pain and distress with no adequate pain relief.  Lucy Finch vowed then, that with the knowledge and skills that she had, she would never again allow herself to be in that position where she could not help somebody who was suffering."]}, {"page": "Hospice Africa Uganda", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anne Merriman"]}]}}
