The Council, which has the ability to authorise the President to dismiss the National Parliament, was the first meeting between Gusm\u00e3o and Prime Minister Alkatiri since the escalation of violence in the previous week. The meeting was also attended by Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta (leading to speculation that Ramos-Horta might be appointed as a temporary Prime Minister if Alkatiri were to be sacked), the Bishop of Dili, the UNOTIL representative Sukehiro Hasegawa and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's personal representative Ian Martin, who was previously the UN representative to East Timor in the leadup to the independence referendum in 1999. Gusm\u00e3o emerged from the meeting in the afternoon of 29 May to urge crowds gathered outside, composed of supporters of Gusm\u00e3o and Ramos-Horta and opponents of Alkatiri, to put down their weapons and return home, saying \"If you trust me, west and east, embrace each other in your home, be calm and help each other to stay calm\"."]}]}}
