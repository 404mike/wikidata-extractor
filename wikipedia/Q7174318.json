Marxist economic geographer David Harvey describes neoliberalism as a \"class project\" \"carried out by the corporate capitalist class\", and argued in his book A Brief History of Neoliberalism that neoliberalism is designed to increase the class power of economic elites.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  Also see . Economists G\u00e9rard Dum\u00e9nil and Dominique L\u00e9vy posit that \"the restoration and increase of the power, income, and wealth of the upper classes\" are the primary objectives of the neoliberal agenda. Economist David M. Kotz contends that neoliberalism \"is based on the thorough domination of labor by capital\". Sociologist Thomas Volscho argues that the imposition of neoliberalism in the United States arose from a conscious political mobilization by capitalist elites in the 1970s, who faced two self-described crises: the legitimacy of capitalism and a falling rate of profitability in industry.

In The Global Gamble, Peter Gowan argued that \"neoliberalism\" was not only a free-market ideology but \"a social engineering project\". Globally, it meant opening a state's political economy to products and financial flows from the core countries. Domestically, neoliberalism meant the remaking of social relations \"in favour of creditor and rentier interests, with the subordination of the productive sector to financial sectors, and a drive to shift wealth, power and security away from the bulk of the working population.\""]}, {"page": "London Metropolitan University", "response": ["*Peter Gowan, left-wing intellectual and editor of New Left Review"]}, {"page": "Hungarian Revolution of 1956", "response": ["Nicolas Krass\u00f3 was one of the left leaders of the Hungarian uprising and member of the New Left Review editorial committee. In an interview he gave to Peter Gowan shortly before his death, Krass\u00f3 summed up the meaning of the Hungarian Revolution with a recollection from Stalin's short speech in the 19th Congress of the Soviet Union in 1952: \"Stalin kept silent throughout the Congress till the very end when he made a short speech that covers about two and a half printed pages. He said there were two banners that the progressive bourgeoisie had thrown away and which the working class should pick up\u2014the banners of democracy and national independence. Certainly nobody could doubt that in 1956 the Hungarian workers raised these banners high.\""]}]}}
