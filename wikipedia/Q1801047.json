This serial is believed to have been lost during the BBC's archival purge in the 1960s and 70s, and virtually nothing else is known about it beyond the rest of the cast and the episode titles. No photographs are known to exist either, leaving no visual record on any aspect of the production. Seely is credited for the final episode, suggesting it may have shared the same twist ending as the 2012 version."]}]}}
