Essential in the new organization is that the institute is an open meeting place for people: artists, thinkers, readers, curators, writers, designers, poets, dreamers, workers, and occasional passers-by. The institute offers high-standard artistic and technical advice in response to individual requirements. Researchers are invited to theorize, formulate and produce. Hallmark of research is its discursive character. The institute offers alternative views of research and production, for which a climate of involvement is paramount in which researchers, artistic and technical staff establish alliances, collaborations and networks that are both practical and conceptual. Researchers can make use of the facilities (\u2018Labs\u2019) inside the institute: the Charles Nypels Lab / Anne P\u00e9tronille Nypels Lab (print workshop), the Heimo Lab / Luzia Hartsuyker-Curjel Lab (wood and metal workshop), the Werner Mantz Lab / Elsa Stansfield Lab (multimedia workshop), the Pierre Kemp Lab / Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Cornips Lab (library and archives), the Jac.
