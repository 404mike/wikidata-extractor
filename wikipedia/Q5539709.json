Nevertheless, the practice did achieve national recognition, especially in the later part of the 19th\u00a0century, and in particular for its churches.  A contemporary opinion of the practice was given by the German architect and critic Hermann Muthesius who was present in England between 1896 and 1904.  He commented on English architecture and architects, and in his book Die neuere kirchliche Baukunst in England (1901) he placed the works of Austin and Paley on a par with Bodley and Garner, James Brooks, J. D. Sedding, Norman Shaw, and George Gilbert Scott, junior.  He was particularly impressed by St Peter, Lancaster, and by the village churches designed by the practice.  Writing in 1969 the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner said \"this Lancaster dynasty of architects did more work in the county, and for a time more outstanding work, than any other\".  Referring to the late Victorian churches designed by the practice, Pevsner stated that they were \"of the highest European standard of their years\".
