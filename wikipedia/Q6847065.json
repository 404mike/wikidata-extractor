He signed the contract within days, saying it was time to \"finish the job I started\". Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe. Days before the start of the season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion, and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope, also a free transfer signing. After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals \u2013 both scoring and conceding \u2013 Adams decided to give his players \"a kick up the backside\" by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers (on loan) and Rob Kozluk.

Adams' notoriously tough pre-season training regime began in earnest, though the players reported that they had come to expect the hard work come summertime and Adams himself was pleased with the condition his players began the pre-season in. Adams built on his new youth policy with the signatures of Sheffield United duo Kingsley James and Phil Roe; as well as Walsall defender Clayton McDonald, and left-back Mike Green.

Following this tour, Justin Richards made a surprise exit to Burton Albion \u2013 this left namesake Marc as the club's senior player at the relatively young age of 29, in one of the club's youngest ever squads.

Andrew Little returned to parent club Rangers after the game, having damaged his knee ligaments during the defeat. Mike Green also left the club after asking to have his contract terminated following a loan spell at Eastleigh.

The two Stevenage loanees scored a goal a piece against struggling Dagenham & Redbridge on 10 December, to give the Vale their first win in more than six weeks. Supporters showed their disapproval against the board by displaying red cards in the home fixture against Aldershot Town, a game in which Madjo scored a hat-trick. Following this match, both Roe and McDonald were signed until the end of the season, whilst Kozluk was released. On 30 December, midfield playmaker Gary Roberts had his contract terminated following two serious breaches of club discipline in the space of three months. Nominated for the Manager of the Month award for three wins in four December games, Adams revealed that due to the club's precarious financial position he was unable to sign any new players or even retain his loan players in the January transfer window \u2013 despite the chairman having previously told him to draw up a list of transfer targets.
