These are principally caused by sound waves that are continuously driven and damped by convection near the Sun's surface.  It is similar to geoseismology, or asteroseismology (also coined by Gough), which are respectively the studies of the Earth or stars through their oscillations. While the Sun's oscillations were first detected in the early 1960s, it was only in the mid-1970s that it was realized that the oscillations propagated throughout the Sun and could allow scientists to study the Sun's deep interior.  The modern field is separated into global helioseismology, which studies the Sun's resonant modes directly,  and local helioseismology, which studies the propagation of the component waves near the Sun's surface.", "Solar oscillations were first observed in the early 1960s as a quasi-periodic intensity and line-of-sight velocity variation with a period of about 5 minutes.  Scientists gradually realized that the oscillations might be global modes of the Sun and predicted that the modes would form clear ridges in two-dimensional power spectra.  The ridges were subsequently confirmed in observations of high-degree modes in the mid 1970s, and mode multiplets of different radial orders were distinguished in whole-disc observations.  At a similar time,  J\u00f8rgen Christensen-Dalsgaard and Douglas Gough suggested the potential of using individual mode frequencies to infer the interior structure of the Sun.  They calibrated solar models against the low-degree data  finding two similarly good fits, one with low Y and a corresponding low neutrino production rate L_\\nu, the other with higher Y and L_\\nu; earlier envelope calibrations against high-degree frequencies  preferred the latter, but the results were not wholly convincing.  It was not until Tom Duvall and Jack Harvey  connected the two extreme data  sets by measuring modes of intermediate degree to establish the quantum numbers associated with the earlier observations that the higher-Y model was established, thereby suggesting at that early stage that the resolution of the neutrino problem must lie in nuclear or particle physics."]}, {"page": "Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society", "response": ["| 2010 || Douglas Gough || John Woodhouse || || "]}, {"page": "Gough", "response": ["*Douglas Gough FRS (born 1941), a British astronomer, and Leverhulme Emeritus Fellow at the University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge", "response": ["* Douglas Gough "]}, {"page": "Hackney Downs School", "response": ["* Douglas Gough, Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics since 1993 at the University of Cambridge, and Director 1999\u20132004 of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge"]}, {"page": "The Planets (1999 TV series)", "response": ["Commentators in episode 5 include Douglas Gough.
