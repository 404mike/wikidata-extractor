However, in mid-July they cancelled their plan after the king read intercepted letters in which Deane described the military situation of the Colonies as hopeless and suggested a rapprochement with Britain. Deane's correspondence was then forwarded to General Henry Clinton, who provided copies to Loyalist James Rivington to publish in his newspaper Rivington's Royal Gazette in New York City. Deane was then accused of being a traitor by his fellow colonists. Rivington may have been a spy as a member of the Culper Ring, and unbeknownst to Deane, his former secretary in Paris, Edward Bancroft, had been a British spy."]}, {"page": "Timeline of the American Revolution", "response": ["*James Rivington's New-York Gazeteer begins publication (April 22)"]}, {"page": "Henry Knox", "response": ["Knox supported the Sons of Liberty, an organization of agitators against what they considered tyrannical policies by the British Parliament.
