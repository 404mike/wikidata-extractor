Holland is an English theoretical physicist, known for his work on foundational problems in quantum physics and in particular his book on the pilot wave theory and the de Broglie-Bohm causal interpretation of quantum mechanics. \nHolland was educated at Hazelwick Comprehensive School in Crawley, West Sussex and at Imperial College. He did his Ph.D. on algebraic topological methods in physics under David Bohm at Birkbeck College.Holland has worked at the University of London, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris), Bristol UWE and the University of Oxford. He is an editor of Physics Letters A.In 1993, Holland published his book \u201cThe Quantum Theory of Motion\u2019\u2019 in which he presented a comprehensive account of the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics initiated by Louis de Broglie and, in a more complete form, by David Bohm.\n\nRecent workDrawing upon numerical trajectory-based methods for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and upon methods of hydrodynamics, Holland showed in 2004 how the time evolution of the wavefunction could be derived exactly from the dynamical evolution of a congruence of spacetime trajectories. The method achieves the same result as Richard Feynman's path integral formulation (the mapping of the initial wavefunction through time) but, instead of using Feynman's 'all possible paths' between two points, it employs at most one path. This is a considerable conceptual advantage in understanding quantum motion and is potentially a computational benefit too. Another difference with Feynman is that, while the trajectories do the job of evolving the quantum system in time, the initial wavefunction is integral to the trajectory dynamical equations, as it provides the initial density and the initial velocity. Using Riemannian geometry Holland formulated this method in very general terms that includes as special cases quantum many-particle systems and spin. He has applied it to other field theories such as electromagnetism and second-order wave equations. \nHolland has published many peer-reviewed articles on the foundations of physics including the quantum potential, quantum hydrodynamics, quantum field theory, symmetries, hidden-variables theories, quantum back-reaction, quantum Hamilton-Jacobi theory, classical-like quantum systems, and the history of physics. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory", "response": ["The wavefunction itself, and not the particles, determines the dynamical evolution of the system: the particles do not act back onto the wave function.

Holland has pointed out that, earlier in 1927, Einstein had actually submitted a preprint with a similar proposal but, not convinced, had withdrawn it before publication. According to Holland, failure to appreciate key points of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory has led to confusion, the key point being \"that the trajectories of a many-body quantum system are correlated not because the particles exert a direct force on one another (\u00e0 la Coulomb) but because all are acted upon by an entity \u2013 mathematically described by the wavefunction or functions of it \u2013 that lies beyond them\".

Holland spoke in his book of 1993 of a \u2018quantum potential-like term\u2019 that is proportional \\Box R/R. He emphasized however that to give the Klein\u2013Gordon theory a single-particle interpretation in terms of trajectories, as can be done for nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger quantum mechanics, would lead to unacceptable inconsistencies. For instance, wave functions \\psi(\\mathbf{x},t) that are solutions to the Klein\u2013Gordon or the Dirac equation cannot be interpreted as the probability amplitude for a particle to be found in a given volume d^3 x at time t in accordance with the usual axioms of quantum mechanics, and similarly in the causal interpretation it cannot be interpreted as the probability for the particle to be in that volume at that time. Holland pointed out that, while efforts have been made to determine a Hermitian position operator that would allow an interpretation of configuration space quantum field theory, in particular using the Newton\u2013Wigner localization approach, but that no connection with possibilities for an empirical determination of position in terms of a relativistic measurement theory or for a trajectory interpretation has so far been established. Yet according to Holland this does not mean that the trajectory concept is to be discarded from considerations of relativistic quantum mechanics.Peter R.

The Wigner and Moyal transformation of the characteristic matrix yields a complex function, for which the dynamics can be described in terms of a (generalized) Liouville equation with the aid of a matrix operating in phase space, leading to eigenvalues that can be identified with stationary states of motion. From the characteristic matrix, they constructed a further matrix that has only non-negative eigenvalues which can thus be interpreted as a quantum \"statistical matrix\". Bohm and Hiley thus demonstrated a relation between the Wigner\u2013Moyal approach and Bohm's theory of an implicate order that allows to avoid the problem of negative probabilities. They noted that this work stands in close connection with Ilya Prigogine's proposal of a Liouville space extension of quantum mechanics. They extended this approach further to relativistic phase space by applying the phase space interpretation of Mario Sch\u00f6nberg to the Dirac algebra. Their approach was subsequently applied by Peter R. Holland to fermions and by Alves O. Bolivar to bosons.A.O.

The relevance of quantum non-equilibrium states to physics lies in the fact that they can lead to different predictions for results of experiments, depending on whether the De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory in its stochastic form or the Copenhagen interpretation is assumed to describe reality. (The Copenhagen interpretation, which stipulates the Born rule a priori, does not foresee the existence of quantum non-equilibrium states at all.)
