At an early age Fielding became a pupil of John Varley.  In 1810 he became an associate exhibitor in the Old Water-colour Society, in 1813 a full member and in 1831 President of that body (later known as the Royal Society of Watercolours), until his death.  In 1824 he won a gold medal at the Paris Salon alongside Richard Parkes Bonington and John Constable.  He also engaged largely in teaching the art and made ample profits.  He later moved to Park Crescent in Worthing and died in the town in March 1855.\nCopley Fielding was a painter of much elegance, taste and accomplishment and has always been highly popular with purchasers.  He painted a vast number of all sorts of views (occasionally in oil-colour) including marine subjects.  Examples of his work is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum and other major museums in Britain.  Among the engraved specimens of his art is the Annual of British Landscape Scenery, published in 1839.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sussex", "response": ["In the 19th century landscape watercolourist Copley Fielding lived in Sussex and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley and painter and sculptor Eric Gill were born in Brighton.

He composed elegant, though mainly conventional poetry, some of which was published in Friendship's Offering. His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by Samuel Rogers's poem Italy (1830), a copy of which was given to him as a 13th birthday present; in particular, he  deeply admired the accompanying illustrations by J. M. W. Turner. Much of Ruskin's own art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and of Samuel Prout, whose Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, Copley Fielding and J. D.

His method of developing the watercolor painting in stages, starting with large, vague color areas established on wet paper, then refining the image through a sequence of washes and glazes, permitted him to produce large numbers of paintings with \"workshop efficiency\" and made him a multimillionaire, partly by sales from his personal art gallery, the first of its kind. Among the important and highly talented contemporaries of Turner and Girtin were John Varley, John Sell Cotman, Anthony Copley Fielding, Samuel Palmer, William Havell, and Samuel Prout.
