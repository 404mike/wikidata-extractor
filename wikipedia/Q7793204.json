Pembroke ruled in their favor, and Shank and the Burbages protested. The affair generated a supply of documents, sometimes called the \"sharers' papers,\" that throw light on the theatre conditions of the era.Halliday, p. 449. Shanks, for example, asserted that each of the three petitioners, as a sharer in the company, had an annual income of \u00a3180, a very comfortable living for that era. The Burbages and Shank also complained that Swanston owned a third of one of the eight shares in the Blackfriars, and so wasn't entirely excluded from the householders' profits. The disagreement was not fatal for Swanston's credit in the troupe, by any means: on 5 June 1638, Swanston alone signed for a payment of \u00a3240 for the company's Court performancesGurr, Shakespeare Company, p. 243.

Shank is known to have played at least one female role himself in these years, the minor part of the servant Petella in the company's 1632 revival of Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase.

Pembroke ordered Shank and the Burbage family to sell shares to the three actors; but Shank and Cuthbert Burbage both protested the ruling. The dispute generated a back-and-forth documentation, sometimes called the \"sharers' papers,\" that has provided subsequent generations of scholars and researchers with important data on the theatre business of the age. Shank complained that he and the three actors could not reach acceptable terms for a sale, and that they prevented him from performing with the company.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 339.
