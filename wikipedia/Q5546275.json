While working as a lorry boy, Wilkins played football for Hayes. In 1938 he signed as a professional for Brentford. After making his First Division debut in January 1939 he played three League games before the Second World War. He continued to play for Brentford during the war, including at Wembley in the 1942 London Cup Final, when Brentford beat Portsmouth. He served in the Royal Kent Regiment. When the war ended, he continued with Brentford but was sold in February 1947 for a fee of \u00a37,000 to Bradford Park Avenue. In the following December he was sold to Nottingham Forest for \u00a37,500. He moved to Leeds in September 1949 but only played 3 games for them. In a career interrupted by the war, he played 83 league games and scored 19 goals for the 4 professional clubs.\nIn December 1949 he returned to Hayes as a coach. He played in the Kent League for Dover in the 1952\u201353 season. He was coach 3 times at Hayes until sacked in January 1961, when the players complained of his over-rigorous training methods.\nThree of his sons, Graham, Ray and Dean Wilkins, played professional football, with Ray playing 84 times for England. Another son, Stephen, was signed by Chelsea and made one appearance for Brentford, before playing for a number of non-league teams, including Dagenham and Hayes.\nHe died in Bournemouth, Dorset, in January 1999.

Matters were made worse when McAloon and Durrant were quickly sold to Celtic and Queens Park Rangers respectively. A supporter, writing to The Brentford & Chiswick Times, commented \"it would seem that Brentford were unaware when they allowed them to go that Thomas, Durrant and McAloon had scored very nearly all the side\u2019s goals in the previous season\". Manager Curtis received half back George Paterson from Celtic in part exchange for McAloon and also strengthened the team with full back Malky Macdonald and forward Archie Macaulay.

Despite Len Townsend coming into form and going on to become the Bees' top scorer for the season, the goalscoring problem was compounded by the transfer request and subsequent sale of George Wilkins in February. Bill Naylor and Dickie Girling were signed in February to bolster the forward line, but scored just three goals between them before the end of the season. On 24 May, defeat to Sunderland and a draw for 20th-place Charlton Athletic away to Everton consigned the Bees to relegation to the Second Division.
