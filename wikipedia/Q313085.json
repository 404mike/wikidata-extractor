Kinnear drew criticism when the 2013 summer transfer window closed with Kinnear failing to make a single permanent signing, lone recruit Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my having been signed on loan from Queens Park Rangers. This criticism intensified at the end of the 2014 winter transfer window with Kinnear failing again to make a permanent signing, this after the \u00a320\u00a0million sale of midfielder Yohan Cabaye, with Luuk de Jong having been brought in on loan from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach."]}, {"page": "Craig Bellamy", "response": ["Coventry looked to reduce their wage bill following relegation and accepted an offer of \u00a36.5 million from Newcastle United for Bellamy.
