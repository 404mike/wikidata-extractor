Liberal Democrat politician Lord Oakeshott criticised Diamond, saying: \"If he had any shame he would go. If the Barclays board has any backbone, they'll sack him.\" The US Department of Justice has also been involved, with \"other financial institutions and individuals\" under investigation. On 2 July 2012, Marcus Agius resigned from the chairman position following the interest rate rigging scandal. On 3 July 2012, Bob Diamond resigned with immediate effect, leaving Marcus Agius to fill his post until a replacement is found.
