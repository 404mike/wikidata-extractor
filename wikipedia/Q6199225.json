But I think we expected too much from him. He was happy just to be in the studio with us because he hadn't worked with a band since Blur. His point was he was just recording what he was hearing. He wasn't doing anything that we wouldn't do ourselves normally and we put a lot of pressure on him almost to subvert us. He's a top guy, but it just didn't work.\" The band subsequently co-produced Some Cities with Ben Hillier, who also mixed the album (except for \"Some Cities\" and \"Walk in Fire\", which were mixed by Rich Costey).

We wanted it to be optimistic, more hopeful.\" The band moved away from the Cheetham Hill studio they had recorded Lost Souls in for Revolution Studios in Manchester, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Bath, The Dairy and 2\u00a0kHz Studios in London, and a cottage in Lancashire (additionally, \"M62 Song\" was recorded under a flyover of the M62 motorway in Northenden). In a 2009 interview with QTheMusic.com, Jez said that the songs came quickly and effortlessly: \"I had this little house in Northenden where my makeshift studio was. It took a couple of nights to get the backing track with the top line melody to \"There Goes the Fear\". Literally the next night I had \"Words\" coming out of the speakers.\" \"Caught by the River\" was the final song recorded for the album, which took form at a rehearsal room in Stockport called The Green Room. \"Jimi, Andy and I just started to play these three chords. Jimi started to sing this great top line melody and there it was... very natural and easy. Andy started to write these very poignant lyrics about a friend of ours; everything started to click like at the start of the recording. That was the last piece of the jigsaw for the album,\" said Jez. The band also incorporated string, brass, and woodwind arrangements into the songs, arranged by The High Llamas frontman Sean O'Hagan, as well as gospel choir vocals on \"Satellites\", while lead single \"There Goes the Fear\" features a Brazilian Carnival-inspired percussive outro. Doves wrote, recorded, and mixed the album within eight months, \"which for Doves was incredibly fast,\" concluded Jez Williams.", "The Last Broadcast was met with critical praise. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 85, based on 20 reviews. NME awarded the album 9 out of 10 stars, calling the album \"the most uplifting miserable album you'll hear all year.\" The Austin Chronicle called the album \"[a] stunner... an infectious, melancholy, ultimately euphoric barrage of sound wrapped in a sheeting of guitars and subtle effects that coalesce around frontman Jimi Goodwin's plaintive voice and brothers Jez and Andy Williams' lovely, pounding, relentless vibe that echoes with hints of Northern soul and terrifically big beats.\" Blender called the album \"utterly entrancing,\" while AllMusic praised it as a \"musical daybreak.\""]}, {"page": "Lost Souls (Doves album)", "response": ["In the early 1990s, Jimi Goodwin and twin brothers Jez and Andy Williams were producing dance music as Sub Sub.

The band embarked on their first-ever tour of North America in late 2000 and early 2001. Jimi Goodwin described to Excellent Online that the U.S. shows were \"pleasantly surprising\" with the turn-outs and crowd reactions: \"The crowds have been amazing. Pretty much all selling out, which we couldn't believe.\u00a0... It's really nice. Astralwerks do seem pretty sussed, and they're just letting us be us.

Let's just try sneaking in the back door a little. I don't know how American numbers work. I don't know how America works. This is our first time here as a band. We've travelled it, but not musically. We've done a few of them sit-down, meet-and-greets with radio, we've gotten some acoustic work out.\u00a0...
