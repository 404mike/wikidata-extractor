However, the job was done after an hour, and they seemed to take their foot of the gas-a trait they may not wish to fall into permanently. Saints started sharply against an out of sorts Salford side coming off the back of a heavy defeat to Crusaders the week previous, with tries from Chris Flannery and the first of two from Kyle Eastmond. Salford hit back through Luke Patten, but it took them to the second half to post more points; a spell in which St Helens totally dominated and scored another five tries of their own. James Roby in a brilliant performance, Francis Meli, Jonny Lomax and Ade Gardner all crossed to give Saints a 38-6 lead at the break. The second half started in bizarre fashion, with two tries in the first minute from either side; for Salford Ashley Gibson, for St Helens, Lee Gaskell. Paul Clough and Michael Shenton completed the scoring for Saints, before Stefan Ratchford and Jodie Broughton made the scoreline a little more respectable for the Reds."]}, {"page": "2012 Leeds Rhinos season", "response": ["| Salford Squad || 1 Luke Patten, 2 Jodie Broughton, 3 Sean Gleeson, 4 Joel Moon, 18 Ashley Gibson, 6 Daniel Holdsworth, 7 Matty Smith, 15 Adam Sidlow, 9 Wayne Godwin, 10 Lee Jewitt, 11 Matty Ashurst, 16 Luke Adamson, 13 Stephen Wild Subs 14 Chris Nero, 17 Iafeta Paleaaesina, 21 Jordan James, 24 Stuart Howarth", "| Salford Tries || Lee Jewitt (6), Jodie Broughton (50)"]}, {"page": "2012 European Cup (rugby league)", "response": ["| align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\" | 5.
