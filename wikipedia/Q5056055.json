Sellars turned down a trial at Manchester United in favour of turning professional with ambitious Northern League club Leadgate Park who offered him \u00a32 a week. He was recommended to several Football League clubs by various scouts and Stoke City manager Tom Mather signed him on 15 December 1923. He began his Stoke career at inside-left and scored on his debut against Clapton Orient on 26 January 1924. He was in and out of the side in the next three seasons before Sellars converted to half-back in 1925\u201326 as Stoke were relegated to the Third Division North.
