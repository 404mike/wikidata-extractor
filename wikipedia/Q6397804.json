Rudge understated things somewhat when he said: \"We cannot change things overnight.\" However, player Tommy Gore noted \"the players are in a more determined mood.\" He signed left sided midfielder Kevin Young on loan, and switched Eamonn O'Keefe from midfield to the attack. He was appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 9 March. He was unable to prevent relegation that year, though the club did avoid picking up the wooden spoon. Though Mark Bright and Robbie Earle were signed to Vale before Rudge's appointment, he helped to nurture their talents, both were the first of many to develop into outstanding players under Rudge."]}, {"page": "Kevin", "response": ["*Kevin Young (born 1961), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of foreign football players in the Netherlands", "response": ["*Kevin Young \u2013 Utrecht \u2013 1986\u201390"]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["John Rudge was appointed caretaker-manager, and made his first signing by taking midfielder Kevin Young on loan from Burnley. His side were defeated 4\u20130 at Deepdale by Preston North End, and finished the game with just nine men. By now thirteen points short of safety, and seven points from their nearest competitors, The Sentinel's Chris Harper believed them to be 'the poorest side in the Third Division by quite a long chalk'. The revival started the next day, with a 2\u20130 win over Sheffield United the first of four straight home wins that cut the gap to safety down to only four points. O'Keefe and Henderson formed a potent striking partnership, whilst Young added balance to the midfield. Jim Steel was sold off to Wrexham for \u00a310,000. Rudge said the battle to avoid relegation was as difficult a job as 'trying to climb Everest in a pair of pumps'. Struggling again in February, their 4\u20132 win over Newport County lifted them off the bottom spot. Following a 4\u20133 win over Brentford on 3 March, Rudge was appointed as manager until the end of the season. He took Millwall's Andy Massey on loan, but failed to re-sign Bob Newton. On 19 March, Vale defeated fellow strugglers Southend United 2\u20131 at Roots Hall, their first away game of the league campaign, it took them out of the relegation zone. The job only got more difficult for Rudge however, as an injury crisis developed, and the team went nine games with just one victory. Young striker Mark Bright scored five times in the final six games, yet relegation was all but confirmed despite a 1\u20130 win over promotion-chasing Hull City. Just 2,299 turned up at Vale Park for a final day 1\u20130 victory over Millwall, yet a pitch invasion still ensued, with the invaders chanting \"We'll be back\".", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Kevin Young", "|4||MF||||Kevin Young||4||0||0||0||4", "| December 1983 || MF ||  || Kevin Young || Burnley || End of season || "]}]}}
