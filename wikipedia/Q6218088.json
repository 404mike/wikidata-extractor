Despite a resurgence in limited overs matches, Lancashire finished in the bottom six of the county championship. After suffering defeat in the final of the 1986 Nat West Trophy, David Hughes was appointed captain. Towards the end of the 1980s, Lancashire's side began to develop, with Graeme Fowler and Gehan Mendis building a productive opening partnership, while David Hughes and Neil Fairbrother provided support in the middle order. The bowlers were led by Patrick Patterson and Paul Allott with support from David Hughes, Mike Watkinson and Jack Simmons. In 1987 after eleven successive years in the bottom six, Lancashire finished second in the championship, their highest position in 27\u00a0years. Mike Atherton made his Lancashire debut in 1987\u00a0\u2013 scoring 600\u00a0runs in the second half of the season\u00a0\u2013 and Wasim Akram first played for the team in 1988.

His father was Isaac John Abrahams, in his time dubbed the Prince of Batsmen, and his mother was Lillian May Schroeder.  He joined the Lancashire League in 1960. He was trained as a dental technician but the apartheid regime required dental technicians, as people of colour, to work for a white dentist. He resisted this and opened his own private dental lab in Kent Road in Salt River, operating under the radar. In 1960 he was invited to England following the offer of a contract with Milnrow, arranged by Basil D'Oliviera. In Mogamad Allie's cricket history book \"More than a game\", Allie states \"...Abrahams displayed a massive appetite for the game in his new environment, playing for 15 seasons in the Central Lancashire League - first for Milnrow, and later for Radcliffe and Oldham. And although the highpoints were too many to count, his best season was in 1970, when he took 89 wickets at a cost of 10,25 runs per wicket - the best bowling effort in the league that year by a professional\". His family joined him in England in 1962, his wife Cynthia, and children John, Jean, Basil, Peter, Noreen and Lynn. Carole was born in England. His eldest son, John Abrahams, captained the Lancashire county cricket team. His two sons Peter and Basil, regularly played cricket at weekends. He encouraged a number of other Western Province Cricket Board players to join the Lancashire League.
