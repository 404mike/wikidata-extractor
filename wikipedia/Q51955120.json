In 1895 Young returned to Australia and with the Lindsay brothers and Harry Weston did some excellent posters. But the field was limited and many years of poverty followed, during which a certain amount of writing was done for the press. He began exhibiting at the Victorian Artists' Society, but sales were few and the one-man show was then unknown. During his visit to England he had married Mabel Sawyer, an expert wood-carver, and while the lean period lasted Mrs Young helped to keep the house going by executing commissions for Melbourne architects. It was not until 1911 that the appreciation of Young's art really began to be shown. In that year he held an exhibition at Melbourne of small pictures, some of which had similar qualities to the Japanese coloured wood-cuts of the eighteenth century. Sales were good, partly because the prices were low, and the artist was sufficiently encouraged to hold an exhibition at Adelaide. This was both an artistic and a financial success, other shows followed in Melbourne and Sydney, and at last, in his fiftieth year, Young's reputation as an artist was established."]}, {"page": "Great Britain men's national basketball team", "response": ["3 Lionel Price, 4 Robert Norris, 5 Stanley Weston, 6 Trevor Davies, 7 Malcolm Finlay, 8 Colin Hunt, 9 Frank Cole, 10 Douglas Legg, 11 Ronald Legg, 12 Harry Weston, 13 Alex Eke, 14 Stanley McMeekan, 15 Sydney McMeekan (Coach: Malcolm Finlay)"]}, {"page": "Embassy Cinema, Chadwell Heath", "response": ["The Embassy Cinema is a former cinema in the town of Chadwell Heath, Greater London.Odeon Chadwell Heath, Cinema Treasures Guide It was once known, among locals, as The Gaumont.
