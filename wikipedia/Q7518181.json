The storyline was developed as of the BBC's Headroom campaign, which aims to encourage people to look after their mental wellbeing. Series Consultant Simon Ashdown had been developing the storyline for about a year. To accurately reflect the issue, EastEnders worked closely with various charities such as Mind and MDF The BiPolar Organisation, medical practitioners and bipolar sufferers when researching the storyline. The story was moulded around what Stacey would do in that situation and what the research led the team to believe was the most truthful way events would develop. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that the initial buildup of the storyline was an extension of how the character has always been, \"a character of highs and lows, of great passions and dark moods,\" but these highs and lows would become more contrasted, and viewers would realise that Stacey's mood is more complex than just being upset over her losses, adding, \"It's the beginning of us getting to really know and understand who Stacey is and what makes her behave the way she does.\" Turner hoped that she could do the storyline justice, saying that she believed it was great that EastEnders continued to raise awareness of the issue."]}, {"page": "Jean Slater", "response": ["In May 2009, Stacey started showing signs of bipolar disorder.

The disorder's different for everybody. I wait until the scripts come in and sometimes I think 'we've been on a flat level for too long' so I find a way within the dialogue to make it a bit different.\" The actress also revealed that she greatly enjoys working on EastEnders as it is always full of surprises. In May 2010, Wright told Kris Green of Digital Spy that working with EastEnders is a privilege. Before her return was announced, she said of her departure: \"Things can't last forever. I am an actress and it's all a big adventure, isn't it? It's wonderful to have been in it for so long.

In the storyline, Bianca had fallen on hard times, and after being evicted from her flat her children were taken into custody, so Bianca returned to Walford to seek help from her grandmother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). In the documentary EastEnders: Ricky and Bianca, which aired to celebrate the character's return, the changes in Bianca's character were noted: \"The carefree, wild child of yesterday, has been replaced by the wore-torn and downtrodden single mum of four. Bianca has done what she always wanted to avoid, repeating the mistakes that her mother Carol had made.\" EastEnders' series consultant Simon Ashdown has commented, \"Bianca's still the same Bianca in a way, she still speaks before she thinks, comes out fists flying. She's got that family of misfit kids with different fathers [...] She's like Carol.\" The BBC described the character's comeback as a \"big hit\". However, James Walton from The Telegraph accused the Jackson family of being melodramatic and \"boring\", adding \"Perhaps the storyline is meant to be an updated version of [1966 BBC drama] Cathy Come Home \u2013 yet if so, the writers have forgotten one important thing. We\u2019re supposed to be rooting for the mother rather than for Social Services.\"", "Bianca's most notable initial storyline upon her return was a pedophilia plot revolving around her new boyfriend Tony King (Chris Coghill), and her 15-year-old step daughter, Whitney. The idea for the storyline was conceptualized by writer Simon Ashdown and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to EastEnders. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by an image of a woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering \"What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a pedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family\". They pitched the idea to John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, who said that \"It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for.\" However, pedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk. Diederick Santer commented, \"We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show.\" It has been noted in the media that pedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although EastEnders had broached it in 2001 with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her abusive uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult."]}, {"page": "Tanya Branning", "response": ["Joyner made an unannounced return on 25 December 2017 as part of Jossa and Fitzgerald's departures.
