He announced this after the polls had closed in interviews on TV and radio covering the results as they came in. He said he did so, in common with many others, to persuade Labour unequivocally to back a People's Vote.  Two days later, by email, he was expelled from the Party, a move which provoked a major media storm in which many other Labour members outed themselves as having voted for parties other than Labour, including Cherie Blair, Charles Clarke, Bob Ainsworth and Betty Boothroyd. A hashtag #ExpelMeToo trended on Twitter as ordinary members expressed their support for Campbell. He immediately appealed the decision, saying tactical voting was not a breach of the rule under which he had been expelled, and arguing that unless all others who had acted as he did were expelled he also had a case for discrimination. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson condemned the expulsion as \"spiteful\" and a number of senior MPs immediately called for the decision to be reversed, and an amnesty of all who voted against Labour in the European elections."]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for Defence", "response": ["| The Right HonourableBob AinsworthMP for Coventry North East(born 1952)"]}, {"page": "Treasurer of the Household", "response": ["|Bob Ainsworth"]}, {"page": "Mike Jackson (British Army officer)", "response": ["Jackson re-appeared in the headlines when he and other retired generals, including Major General Tim Cross\u2014who was involved in the planning effort and later commanded all British troops in Iraq\u2014criticised the American post-war planning for Iraq and attacked the statement by Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense, at the time of the invasion, that the US does not \"do nation-building\", calling it \"nonsensical\" and \"intellectually bankrupt\". Jackson also joined criticism of the British National Party (BNP) in the midst of the 2009 controversy surrounding party leader Nick Griffin's appearance on the panel show Question Time. He accused the BNP of \"hijacking\" military symbols, saying \"the BNP is claiming that it has a better relationship with the Armed Forces than other political parties. How dare they use the image of the Army, in particular, to promote their policies?\" He elaborated that it was not a party political issue, but an issue of the armed forces' reputation. Griffin retaliated by calling Jackson and Sir Richard Dannatt \"war criminals\". A disagreement between Jackson and then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth made headlines in 2009, when Ainsworth stated that the UK could only manage a small increase to troop numbers in Afghanistan, saying that the Army had pushed \"too hard\" when it was engaged in operation in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Jackson countered by saying that the UK should play a decisive role and that the drawdown of troops from Iraq meant the UK had the capability for a larger increase."]}, {"page": "Type 42 destroyer", "response": ["! | Estimated building cost\"Unit cost, i.e. excluding cost of certain items (e.g. aircraft, First Outfits).\" \u2013 Text from Defences Estimates\"They do not include other costs, such as those for Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)\u2014as they are not held centrally for each ship and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.\" Bob Ainsworth, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, 16 July 2008."]}, {"page": "Robert William Ainsworth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Ainsworth"]}, {"page": "Adrian Bailey", "response": ["Following the 2005 general election, Bailey became a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and served successive Secretaries of State, David Blunkett and John Hutton.
