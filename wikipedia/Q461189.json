Her periodical, The Guardian of Education, helped to define the emerging genre by seriously reviewing children's literature for the first time; it also provided the first history of children's literature, establishing a canon of the early landmarks of the genre that scholars still use today. Trimmer's most popular children's book, Fabulous Histories, inspired numerous children's animal stories and remained in print for over a century.\nTrimmer was also an active philanthropist. She founded several Sunday schools and charity schools in her parish. To further these educational projects, she wrote textbooks and manuals for women interested in starting their own schools. Trimmer's efforts inspired other women, such as Hannah More, to establish Sunday school programs and to write for children and the poor.\nTrimmer's works are dedicated to maintaining many aspects of the social and political status quo. As a high church Anglican, she was intent on promoting the established Church of England and on teaching young children and the poor the doctrines of Christianity. Her writings outlined the benefits of social hierarchy, arguing that each class should remain in its God-given position. Yet, while supporting many of the traditional political and social ideologies of her time, Trimmer questioned others, such as those surrounding gender and the family.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Age of Enlightenment", "response": ["The first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular and with the entertainment of readers in mind, was Bernard de Fontenelle's Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (1686). The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works.Phillips, (1991), pp. 85, 90 These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as \"a Work entirely New\" that would include \"short and easie  Rules and Astronomical Tables\".Phillips, (1991), p. 90. The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738.Porter, (2003), p. 300. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond scientific academies and the university.Porter, (2003), p. 101. Writing for a growing female audience, Francesco Algarotti published Il Newtonianism per le dame, which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by Elizabeth Carter. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by Henry Pemberton. His A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class.Phillips, (1991), p. 92. During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works themselves. Sarah Trimmer wrote a successful natural history textbook for children titled The Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature (1782), which was published for many years after in eleven editions.Phillips, (1991), p. 107."]}, {"page": "Kew", "response": ["*Joshua Kirby (1716\u20131774) was a landscape painter, engraver, and writer, whose main artistic focus was \"linear perspective\", based on the ideas of English mathematician Brook Taylor.See a short literary biography of Joshua Kirby in Gentleman's Magazine (ed.

In her children's literature periodical, The Guardian of Education, Trimmer introduced the terms \"Books for Children\" (for those under fourteen) and \"Books for Young Persons\" (for those between fourteen and twenty-one), establishing terms of reference for young adult literature that still remain in use.

Both are more worldly than her later works, but neither received much recognition. By contrast, The History of Susan Gray, written for the girls of her Sunday school class in Bridgnorth, made Sherwood a famous author. Like Hannah More's tracts, it is designed to teach middle-class morality to the poor. This novel \u2014 which Patricia Demers, a children's literature scholar, describes as a \"purified Pamela\" \u2014 tells the story of Susan, an orphaned servant girl who \"resists the advances of a philandering soldier; though trembling with emotion at the man's declaration of love and promise of marriage.\"Demers, \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton\", p. 143. The reader is regularly reminded of the \"wages of sin\" since Susan's story is told from her deathbed. A separate narrator, seemingly Sherwood, often interrupts the tale to warn readers against particular actions, such as becoming a \"bad woman.\"Demers, \"Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton\", 143. Despite a didactic tone that is often distasteful to modern readers, Susan Gray was so popular on its appearance that it was pirated by several publishers. In 1816, Sherwood published a revised and \"improved\" version, which Sarah Trimmer reviewed positively in The Guardian of Education.
