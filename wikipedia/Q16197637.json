Documentary evidence shows production beginning in Spain as early as the 10th century AD. The earliest extant Spanish carpet, the so-called Synagogue carpet in the Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin, is a unique survival dated to the 14th century. The earliest group of Hispano-Moresque carpets, Admiral carpets (also known as armorial carpets), has an all-over geometric, repeat pattern punctuated by blazons of noble, Christian Spanish families. The variety of this design was analyzed most thoroughly by May Beattie. Many of the 15th-century, Spanish carpets rely heavily on designs originally developed on the Anatolian Peninsula. Carpet production continued after the Reconquest of Spain and eventual expulsion of the Muslim population in the 15th century. 16th-century Renaissance Spanish carpet design is a derivative of silk textile design. Some of the most popular motifs are wreaths, acanthus leaves and pomegranates."]}, {"page": "Carrickfergus Borough Council", "response": ["*2003\u20132004 May Beattie (Second Woman Mayor)"]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|May Beattie", "|May Beattie"]}, {"page": "East Antrim (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| May Beattie(DUP)", "| align=\"right\" |Jack McKeeMay BeattieNoel McAllister"]}]}}
