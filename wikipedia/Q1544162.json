He is the only person to have trekked solo, and without resupply by third parties, from Canada to the Geographic North Pole.He is also the first Briton to have trekked, without resupply by third parties, to both the North and South Geographic Poles from the respective continental coastlines of North America and Antarctica. Hadow led the multi-award-winning \u00a36.5m international research programme, Catlin Arctic Survey (2007-2012) which investigated sea ice volume, ocean acidification and ocean circulation. A number of papers have since been published in scientific journals by the researchers. He accepted a World Technology Network Award (Environment) on behalf of the Catlin Arctic Survey team in New York (2009); and along with Ann Daniels and Martin Hartley (expedition team members on the 2009 survey), he was declared a \u2018Hero of the Environment\u2019 by TIME magazine for his team's work.\nIn summer 2017, he led Arctic Mission, which became the first boat expedition without icebreakers to sail into the ice-free international waters surrounding the North Geographic Pole. Its pioneering research into the wildlife, ecosystem, and marine pollution of these waters was led in the field by Tim Gordon (University of Exeter, UK). Its marine pollution work was cited by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island) in the US Senate to introduce the 'Save Our Seas Act'.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of polar explorers", "response": ["* Pen Hadow"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Pen Hadow \u2013 British polar explorer and author"]}, {"page": "Simon Murray (businessman)", "response": ["Following a suggestion by his wife, Murray joined Pen Hadow for a trek to the Geographic South Pole.
