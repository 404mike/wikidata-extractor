Set during the period of the tulip mania, the historical drama follows a 17th-century painter in Amsterdam who falls in love with a married woman whose portrait he has been hired to paint. Filmed in 2014, the film went through several delays and earned largely negative reviews from critics, who called it a \"handsomely-mounted period piece undone by uninspired dialogue and excessive plotting\". Also in 2017, Dench reprised the role of Queen Victoria when she headlined Stephen Frears's Victoria & Abdul. The biographical comedy-drama depicts the real-life relationship between the monarch and her Indian Muslim servant Abdul Karim, played by opposite Ali Fazal. While the film was met with lukewarm reviews for its \"imbalanced narrative\", Dench earned specific praise for her performance, earning the actress her 12th Golden Globe nomination."]}, {"page": "Seattle International Film Festival", "response": ["|The First Grader (dir.
