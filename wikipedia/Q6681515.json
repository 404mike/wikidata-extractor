He also learned to fly gliders at the London Gliding Club. He took up power flying, becoming an instructor in 1939. He moved on to multi-engined aircraft and trained pilots on Wellington bombers. In order to improve morale 'Thousand Bomber' raids were organised using every available pilot, including instructors, but Welch was shot down on his fourth raid. He gave himself up at Amsterdam station when the Germans began firing at civilians.\nHe was sent to Stalag Luft III where he assisted in \"The Great Escape\" by building the ventilation pump & fixed links for the tunnel through which 76 prisoners escaped. Later Welch also escaped with Walter Morison during the Delousing Break attempt, planning to steal a German aircraft while wearing fake German uniforms. After two attempts they were re-captured and sent to Colditz. The Colditz Cock glider was already under construction, and Welch performed vital stress calculations. Although the original glider never flew, a replica was successfully flown in February 2000.\nWhile at Colditz he entered a competition, sponsored by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, for prisoners of war to design an offshore yacht of 32\u201335 ft waterline length. Via the Red Cross, he submitted detailed drawings and calculations and won the first prize of \u00a350.\nHe was liberated in 1945. He returned to Farnborough to work on rocket motors before becoming chief instructor of the Surrey Gliding Club at Redhill, a test pilot for new aircraft for the British Gliding Association and a British team pilot in four world gliding championships.\nAfter the war, he became the first pilot to soar a glider twice across the English Channel: first from Redhill to Brussels in a DFS 108 Weihe, and then in a two-seater glider with Frank Irving.\nHe married Ann Douglas, also a pilot and sailor, in 1953. His retirement was spent sailing and working on his boat. Lorne Welch died on 15 May 1998. He was survived by his wife and their daughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lorne", "response": ["*Lorne Welch (1916\u20131998), British engineer and pilot"]}, {"page": "Pyrford", "response": ["* Lorne Welch"]}, {"page": "Welch (surname)", "response": ["*Lorne Welch (1916\u20131998), English engineer"]}, {"page": "Oflag IV-C", "response": [":Lorne Welch was a British NCO flying instructor in GB, 1938\u20131942; officer with 25 Operation Training Unit, RAF in GB, 1942; POW at Stalag Luft III, Sagan and Oflag IV C, Colditz in Germany, 1943\u20131945"]}, {"page": "Ann Welch", "response": ["After the war Welch returned to gliding and with Lorne Welch and Walter Morison (two former prisoners at Colditz Castle) restarted the Surrey Gliding Club, eventually moving it in 1951 to Lasham Airfield.

For twenty years she was in charge of the British Gliding Association's panel of examiners responsible for British instructor standards and training. She was an avid cross-country pilot and became a member of the British team at World Gliding Championships for many years. Flying from Lezno in Poland in 1961, she broke the British women's distance record with 528\u00a0km. Her books on aviation are still widely admired and sought after.

It operated at Odiham Airfield but after two accidents, the Commandant of Sandhurst ordered it to suspend operations. In early 1951 he ordered Major Deane-Drummond to restart the club at Lasham. In the meantime, the Surrey Gliding Club and Imperial College Gliding Club were both seeking a new home, because Redhill Aerodrome had many other users. The Surrey club and Imperial College therefore moved to Lasham in August 1951. As well as Tony Deane-Drummond, other notable instructors at that time included Ann Welch, Lorne Welch and Philip Wills. All of them went on to become British champions. A war-surplus barrage balloon winch was used for launches. Types flown included Slingsby T.21B trainer, Grunau Baby, and various other pre-war German sailplanes."]}, {"page": "Broburn Wanderlust", "response": ["Despite hopes of marketing the Wanderlust in finished and in kit form, only one was made.
