He received his D.Phil. in mathematics in 1954 from Magdalen College, Oxford.He was born in Workington and brought up in Carlisle. During World War II, he left his undergraduate studies at Oxford University for Bletchley Park, to help crack German codes with a small group of mathematicians, which included Alan Turing. At Bletchley Park he persuaded Max Newman (who thought that the women would not care for the \"intellectual effort\") to authorise talks to the Wrens to explain their work mathematically, and the talks were very popular.After graduation, he was a teacher at Westminster School, London and then The Royal Military College of Science. In 1954 he wrote three hugely influential papers in the Journal of the London Mathematical Society, laying the foundations of inverse semigroup theory. Before Preston and Alfred H. Clifford's book, The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups (Vol 1 1961) (Vol 2 1967) and the Russian, Evgenii S. Lyapin's, Semigroups (1960) there was no systematic treatment of semigroups.  The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups was hailed as an excellent achievement that greatly influenced the future development of the subject.In 1963, Professor Preston moved to Australia to take up the chair of mathematics at Monash University, Melbourne. Professor Preston was an important contributor to algebraic semigroup theory and a respected head of school during his various Monash appointments from 1963 until his retirement in 1990.\nHe subsequently spent six months each year in both Oxford, UK, and Melbourne, Australia, passing away peacefully on 14 April 2015 in Oxford at age 89.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Semigroup", "response": ["Anton Sushkevich obtained the first non-trivial results about semigroups.

From that point on, the foundations of semigroup theory were further laid by David Rees, James Alexander Green, Evgenii Sergeevich Lyapin, Alfred H. Clifford and Gordon Preston. The latter two published a two-volume monograph on semigroup theory in 1961 and 1967 respectively.

Later, over beers with friends from other disciplines, Deakin found the name for the new journal, Function. The journal was published from 1977 to 2004, and Deakin became a founding member of its editorial board, its most frequent contributor, and, for much of its existence, its editor-in-chief."]}]}}
