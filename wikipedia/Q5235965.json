At the time, it was unclear whether this would be two series of Inside No. 9, then known by the working title Happy Endings, or a series of Inside No. 9 and a series of some other programme. Inside No. 9 was to be produced by a BBC team, which was later revealed to be David Kerr (director), Jon Plowman (executive producer) and Adam Tandy (producer).", "The BBC ordered a second series of Inside No. 9 before the first episode had aired. The second series was written in 2014, and then filmed from the end of 2014 into early 2015. The writers were permitted two sets for the second series, and so a fake train compartment and a fake flat (for \"La Couchette\" and \"The 12 Days of Christine\" respectively) were built at Twickenham Studios. The other episodes were filmed on location; for example, \"The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge\" was filmed in a barn at the Chiltern Open Air Museum. David Kerr was unable to stay on as director for the second series. Guillem Morales and Dan Zeff each took on directorial duties for two episodes, and Pemberton and Shearsmith, in addition to continuing to write and star in the episodes, jointly directed the other two. The writers had hoped to direct for some time, and this represented a good opportunity to make their directorial debut. While writing for the series, the pair did not know which episodes they would be directing; in an interview, Shearsmith said that the pair had considered directing episodes in which they did not appear much, but scheduling concerns left them with \"Cold Comfort\" and \"Nana's Party\"; the episodes feature the writers quite heavily."]}, {"page": "Sardines (Inside No. 9)", "response": ["\"Sardines\" was written so that a feeling of claustrophobia would develop as the story progressed; Pemberton said that \"our first consideration was, 'Can we get 12 people in a wardrobe?' So when we did the script read-through, the designer bought a wardrobe off eBay and we checked whether we could all get in it and shut the door\". Writers for Broadcast described seeing the assortment of actors \"crammed inside an imposing wardrobe\" during filming as \"an arresting spectacle\". The story is filmed from within a single bedroom, with much of it taking place inside the wardrobe. Filming presented a particular challenge, as the aim was to give the impression that the viewer was in the wardrobe with the characters, and not to \"cheat\" by giving the impression that the viewer was outside the wardrobe looking in. The episode was filmed with two wardrobes; one complete one, and one \"faked\" one. The complete prop was used to film the characters entering the wardrobe, while the other was in a different room for close-up shots from \"within\" the wardrobe. For director David Kerr, the difficulty was sustaining the illusion that everything was happening in a single place, ideally without viewers even realising that there was a technical challenge involved. The episode was filmed mostly in sequence, meaning more actors arrived as the filming continued, reflecting the fact that more characters arrive as the episode progresses. Kerr aimed for a particularly \"immersive\" filming style on the episode, with extensive use of wide angle shots. He aimed to avoid \"leading\" the audience with regard to the more important characters by \"not giving [them] coverage\" earlier in the episode."]}, {"page": "Last Gasp (Inside No. 9)", "response": ["\"Last Gasp\" was inspired by someone Pemberton had seen on children's programme Multi-Coloured Swap Shop who collected apparently empty jars which actually contained air taken from different places. The idea, which he considered \"bizarre\" but \"very special\", had \"haunted\" him. This gave him the idea of collecting the breath of celebrities. The death of Michael Jackson and the death of Amy Winehouse, along with the associated collecting of memorabilia, also served as inspiration. For Pemberton, the family and house in \"Last Gasp\" were very \"normal\". The episode was filmed on location in what director David Kerr called an \"utterly freezing\" house. The finished episode, for Kerr, had a degree of \"suburban darkness\" in that, though the events unfold in a relatively unremarkable setting, the darker side of human nature is revealed. At the same time, the characters' arguments lead to humour. Shearsmith described \"Last Gasp\" as like a My Family episode \"gone wrong\"."]}, {"page": "Emma Thompson on stage and screen", "response": ["| 2018 || Johnny English Strikes Again || The Prime Minister || David Kerr ||"]}, {"page": "Cold Comfort (Inside No. 9)", "response": ["Pemberton and Shearsmith, in addition to writing and starring in \"Cold Comfort\", directed the episode.
