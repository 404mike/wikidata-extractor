By the end of 1920 it was clear that this was an unprofitable undertaking, and the company was renamed North Sea Aerial & General Transport Co., taking control of the Blackburn company's transport arm. However, in January 1924 the company won a contract to run an RAF Reserve training school at Brough Aerodrome, which in 1935 became No. 4 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School (later No. 4 EFTS), where many RAF pilots and foreign airmen were trained \u2013 over 10,000 pilots all told. Among the celebrities who learned to fly there was The Honourable Mrs. Victor Bruce, who then flew around the world in her Blackburn Bluebird, only eight weeks after completing her training. Blackburn managed the training school at Brough until early 1940, when he was appointed manager of a new factory in Sherburn-in-Elmet to build Fairey Swordfish, and in 1944 he took control of all Blackburn's factories in Yorkshire."]}]}}
