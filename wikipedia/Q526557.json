In 2020\u201321 it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for 2021\u201322. Majority-owned by celebrity chef Delia Smith and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is Carrow Road Stadium. It has strong East Anglian rivalry with Ipswich Town. The club has enjoyed much success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has won two Football League Cups, and finished third in the inaugural Premier League in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions. Perhaps its most famous result came in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants Bayern Munich from the UEFA Cup, in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but been unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated Manchester United from the FA Cup in 1959 and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some highly-rated talent of that era, including striker Chris Sutton, winger Ruel Fox, defender Andy Linighan, midfielder Mike Phelan, midfielder Tim Sherwood and striker Justin Fashanu. The club's successful managers have included Ken Brown, Ron Saunders, Dave Stringer, Mike Walker, Nigel Worthington and Paul Lambert."]}, {"page": "Hartlepool", "response": ["* Andy Linighan, former Arsenal footballer who scored the winning goal in the 1993 FA Cup Final"]}, {"page": "Harpenden", "response": ["* Andy Linighan, former Arsenal footballer lived in Bewdley Close, Southdown"]}, {"page": "Billy Bremner", "response": ["Bremner was appointed as Leeds United manager in October 1985, having impressed the boardroom with his work at Doncaster, particularly his negotiation skills during the sale of Ian Snodin; Leeds paid Doncaster \u00a345,000 in compensation.

Robbie Keane scored the only goal of the game. In City's second game in Division One, Morrison was famously sent off for sticking out his tongue at Stan Collymore in a 0\u20130 draw with Fulham. Morrison remonstrated angrily before leaving the pitch, pushing Collymore in the face as he left. Collymore mentioned the incident in his autobiography, stating that Morrison 'stuck his tongue in my mouth' and that he was one of three players (along with Andy Todd and Darren Purse) who sought to 'prove that they were real hard men when they were up against me'. City's first victory of the season came in 6\u20130 defeat of Sheffield United. Morrison's performances endeared him to then Scotland manager Craig Brown. Brown was reportedly interested in calling Morrison up to the international team to play in the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-offs against England. However, twelve games into the season, Morrison picked up an injury, in a 2\u20131 victory against Port Vale. As a result, Morrison was not available to be picked by Brown for Scotland and he missed the rest of the 1999\u20132000 season. The season ended with City being promoted to the Premier League (a rare second successive promotion). Morrison spent 14 months attempting to return to the Manchester City team, even requesting that Royle loan him out to his former club Blackpool who were managed by Steve McMahon at the time. Morrison played 6 times and scored once (in a game against Hartlepool United) for Blackpool. In one of his appearances for Blackpool, they beat Kidderminster Harriers 4\u20131 with both Brett Ormerod and Paul Simpson scoring braces. Morrison then joined Crystal Palace (then managed by Alan Smith), on a months loan in October 2000, to continue improving his match fitness. Palace signed Morrison, on loan, as a replacement for Andy Linighan, who was sacked following a dispute with Palace Chairman Simon Jordan. At Crystal Palace, Morrison played alongside both Neil Ruddock and Steve Staunton in defence. Morrison made his debut for Palace in a 2\u20131 defeat to Birmingham City. In Morrison's second game for Palace, despite defending 'in a ruggedly efficient manner', they lost 3\u20131 to Fulham (with Louis Saha scoring once and Lee Clark scoring a brace for Fulham). Morrison subsequently played in a 3\u20132 defeat to Portsmouth and a 1\u20130 defeat to Grimsby Town After the defeat to Grimsby, Morrison farted during a team talk by Smith, enraging Simon Jordan. Morrison's final game for Palace was a 3\u20133 draw with Bolton Wanderers, in which Dougie Freedman and Clinton Morrison scored late goals to earn a point.
