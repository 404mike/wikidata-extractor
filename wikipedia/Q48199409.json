I. G. Rawlins noted that in \"a life not free from controversy\":\"Prof. Stebbing assuredly selected her targets with a refined academic glee, as, for example, in her Philosophy and the Physicists (1937). The thrusts she delivered seem somewhat on the harsh side; maybe they were not intended to endure. Her whole being brings into relief the difference between logic bent upon truth, and aesthetics bent upon beauty. In her greatness, she lived for the former, others perhaps for the latter. But one day a 'pontiff' will arise and throw a bridge across the narrows; when that happens, the sheer weight of her thought will help to anchor it well and truly on her territory.\""]}]}}
