He was born and died at Scarborough, Yorkshire, England.\nLester had a first-class cricket career lasting from 1945 to 1956 for Yorkshire, but remained a significant influence in the county cricket club's fortunes as scorer and committee man. He made his debut as an amateur right-handed middle-order batsman immediately after World War II, and in 1947 he made three centuries in eleven innings, which left him third in the English national averages behind Denis Compton and Bill Edrich in their year of unparalleled success.\nFor 1948, Lester joined the Yorkshire staff, and for next seven seasons he made more than 1,000 runs each year except 1951. His best years were 1949, when he scored 1,801 runs, and 1952 when, with 1,786 at an average little short of 50 runs an innings, he was fourth in the national averages. After further good seasons in 1953 and 1954, though, his batting fell away badly in 1955, and at the end of July he was dropped from the first team. Apart from one match against Scotland in 1956, he never regained his place.\nLester continued, however, to play for Yorkshire's Second XI for the next six seasons, often captaining the side and acting as the senior player alongside the younger players, including John Hampshire, Geoffrey Boycott, Philip Sharpe and Brian Bolus. There was a brief codicil to his playing career: in 1964, John Hampshire fell ill just before the Gillette Cup one day match against Middlesex at Lord's and Lester, acting as scorer, was drafted into the side. But Yorkshire lost and Lester, batting at number nine, failed to score.\nThereafter, he became Yorkshire's regular scorer until his retirement in 1988.  He was an often forthright champion against what he perceived as the undeserved neglect of the scorer's role in cricket competitions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["Boycott captained Yorkshire for eight seasons from 1971 to 1978, having been appointed following the sacking of Brian Close in 1970. Despite well publicised conflict between the two players, Boycott recorded in 1987 that he regretted Close's removal from the club, and wrote him a letter in admiration for his contributions to Yorkshire.Boycott, p. 146. To captain Yorkshire had been one of Boycott's aims since he started county cricket in 1962.McKinstry, p. 121. Yorkshire's scorer Ted Lester commented later that Boycott \"never got the support he deserved from the committee. After the captaincy was decided on a casting vote, the half that didn't want him never wanted him.\"McKinstry, p. 120. Some members of the committee wanted to remove him almost immediately. He also caused strife between his fellow players, including a reciprocated dislike for Richard Hutton,Boycott, p. 196-171. with many players leaving the club citing personal differences with Boycott as the reason for their departure.McKinstry, p. 141."]}, {"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["The great Yorkshire team of the 1930s had been broken up by the Second World War and a rebuilding phase was underway by the late 1940s, although Yorkshire had won the first post-war County Championship in 1946. Norman Yardley succeeded Brian Sellers as captain in 1948 and his main team members that season were Len Hutton, Ted Lester, Harry Halliday, Vic Wilson, Willie Watson, Frank Smailes, Johnny Wardle, Don Brennan (wicket-keeper), Ellis Robinson, Ron Aspinall and Alex Coxon. Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.Arlott, p. 25."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Yorkshire fell from champions to seventh and used 25 different players in the championship alone. There was future promise in five new caps: wicketkeeper Don Brennan, batsmen Willie Watson and Gerald Smithson, fast bowler Alec Coxon and left arm spinner Johnny Wardle. In addition, future stalwart Ted Lester began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain Vic Wilson made a few appearances. Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946.Playfair, p. 82. The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great Len Hutton who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches. Other players included Harry Crick, Harry Halliday, Freddie Jakeman, Geoffrey Keighley and pace bowler John Whitehead.Playfair, pp. 95\u201397.", " || Ted Lester || 11 || 657 || 142 || 73.00 || 3 ", "* Ted Lester (Yorkshire) \u2013 126 and 142 versus Northamptonshire (Northampton)"]}, {"page": "1952 English cricket season", "response": [" || Ted Lester || 42 || 1786 || 178 || 49.61 || 6 "]}, {"page": "Ted lester", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Lester "]}, {"page": "Roses Match", "response": ["There have been many outstanding bowling performances in Roses Matches, not least Jack Iddon's 9 for 42 for Lancashire in 1937 while the brilliant Yorkshire left arm spinner Johnny Wardle took 9 for 25 on a rain-affected pitch at Old Trafford in 1954. Fred Trueman made his debut in the 1949 game while his longtime England partner, Lancashire legend Brian Statham, made a big impact aged just 20 in his first Roses match in August 1950, when he shocked a packed Old Trafford crowd by falling flat on his face at the start of his opening spell. He picked himself up, dusted himself down and later that over ripped out Frank Lowson's middle stump. He soon dismissed Ted Lester and Willie Watson for 2 more ducks and Wisden said his bowling \"bordered on the sensational\"."]}, {"page": "Edward Lester", "response": ["* Ted Lester (1923\u20132015), English cricketer for Yorkshire"]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Ted Lester 34"]}, {"page": "Ernie Toshack with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["Toshack was rested for the first tour match after the First Test against Northamptonshire, which Australia won by an innings. He returned against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, making four as Australia batted first and scored 249. He then recorded the best innings analysis of his first-class career, taking 7/81 from 40 consecutive overs,Pollard (1990), p. 11.Fingleton, p. 195. bemusing the Yorkshire spectators with his Australian accent and distinctive \"Ow Wizz Ee\" appealing. He removed both openers, including Hutton, and then bowled Yorkshire and England captain Norman Yardley to leave the hosts at 3/107. After Yorkshire reached 4/149, Toshack took four more wickets as the hosts collapsed to be all out for 206. Wicket-keeper Ron Saggers stood up to the wickets and stumped Ted Lester before Toshack removed three lower-order batsmen. Toshack did not bat or bowl again as the match petered into a draw. Bradman decided to bat until late on the third afternoon and secure a draw instead of pressing for a win; Yorkshire only batted for 27 overs in their second innings and the crowd booed Bradman for not pursuing a victory. With the match safe, Bradman elected to rely mainly on his second-choice bowlers to conserve his frontline bowlers' energy for the next Test."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1949", "response": ["|    Ted Lester 140; JD Eggar  219; Coxon 5-48 "]}, {"page": "Graham School", "response": ["*Ted Lester, cricketer, for Yorkshire"]}, {"page": "Scarborough Cricket Club (England)", "response": ["* Ted Lester"]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2015", "response": ["*Ted Lester, 92, English cricketer (Yorkshire).Lester to be sorely missed at Yorkshire"]}]}}
