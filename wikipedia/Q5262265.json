Aldridge had his best season in terms of wickets, taking 68 wickets at an average of 23.63. Worcestershire's bowling attack, however, proved controversial as in different matches first Pearson and then Aldridge were no-balled by the leading umpire Syd Buller for throwing the ball; Buller was a leading figure in a campaign in the 1959 and 1960 seasons to eradicate throwing from first-class cricket following the controversial tour of Australia in 1958\u201359. Pearson's bowling action had been subject to scrutiny before (he was no-balled for throwing in 1954 as well), but Aldridge was then no-balled twice in the game against Leicestershire at Kidderminster."]}, {"page": "Ian Jones (sportsman, born 1934)", "response": ["Jones' batting style remains to be described, but it is known that he bowled right-arm medium pace. He made his first-class debut for Cambridge University against Worcestershire in 1959. He batted once in this match, in the course of which he was dismissed for a duck by Derek Pearson. He made a further first-class appearance for the university, which came in that season against Middlesex. In this match, Jones was dismissed for a duck in the Cambridge first-innings by Robert Caple, while in their second-innings he scored 44 runs before being dismissed by Bob Hurst."]}]}}
