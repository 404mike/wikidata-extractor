He made his league debut against Hartlepool United and made an instant impact as he became only the second Torquay player to score a hat-trick on his debut (the first being Peter Laraman in the 6\u20132 defeat of Barnsley in September 1961). Unfortunately this led to massive expectations being placed on Williams' shoulders, for example, Neville Southall, in goal for Torquay that day, predicted, \"He can go all the way to the Premiership.\" Southall predicts bright future for hat-trick hero Williams"]}, {"page": "Pat O'Toole (footballer)", "response": ["In August 1993 he joined Torquay United, making his debut in midfield as Torquay lost on penalties in the League Cup to Hereford United, with his league debut at right-back in place of Lee Barrow in the 2-1 win away to Darlington on 28 August. He switched to left-back, in place of Scott Colcombe, with Barrow restored at right-back, for the next game, a 1-1 draw at home to Carlisle United and played in the following game, a 3-3 draw at home to Colchester United in which Adrian Foster scored a hat-trick. However, these were his only games for Torquay and he left, joining Bridgnorth Town."]}]}}
