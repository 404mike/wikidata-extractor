He was educated at Manchester Grammar School and then at St. John's College, Cambridge and the University of Zurich. During World War I he served with the Royal Navy cryptographic intelligence division in Room 40 at the Admiralty. After the war he conducted research in Zurich, became a Lecturer in German at Aberdeen University in 1920, and then a Reader at Aberdeen in 1923. Bruford was then appointed Professor of German at the University of Edinburgh in 1929. He was seconded to the Foreign Office during World War II, 1939\u20131943, to work at Bletchley Park. From 1951 he was Schr\u00f6der Professor of German at the University of Cambridge until 1961.\nHis elder daughter was the British potter Joan Brown, and his son was the folklorist Dr Alan Bruford.\nHe lived at Abbey St. Bathans, Duns, Berwickshire. Professor Walter Horace Bruford died in 1988.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Room 40", "response": ["In 1917 naval officers switched to a new code with a new key Nordo for which only 70 messages were intercepted, but the code was also broken. For other purposes VB continued in use throughout the war. Re-ciphering of the code was accomplished using a key made up of a codeword transmitted as part of the message and its date written in German. These were written down in order and then the letters in this key were each numbered according to their order of appearance in the alphabet. This now produced a set of numbered columns in an apparently random order. The coded message would be written out below these boxes starting top left and continuing down the page once a row was filled. The final message was produced by taking the column numbered '1' and reading off its contents downward, then adding on the second column's digits, and so on. In 1918 the key was changed by using the keywords in a different order. This new cipher was broken within a few days by Professor Walter Horace Bruford, who had started working for Room 40 in 1917 and specialised in VB messages. Two messages were received of identical length, one in the new system and one in the old, allowing the changes to be compared.", "Other staff of Room 40 included Frank Adcock, John Beazley, Francis Birch, Walter Horace Bruford, William 'Nobby' Clarke, Alastair Denniston, Frank Cyril Tiarks and Dilly Knox."]}, {"page": "Schr\u00f6der Professor of German", "response": ["* Walter Horace Bruford (1951)"]}, {"page": "W.
