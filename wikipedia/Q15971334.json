Farr reported himself to the medical station several times over the following months. In April 1916, he was kept at the medical station for a fortnight due to his state. On 22 July 1916 he spent the night at a medical station and was discharged for duty the following morning. On 17 September 1916 he again attempted to seek the help of a medical orderly, but was refused as he was not physically wounded and the aid station was dealing with a high number of battle casualties. Farr reported for duty at the transport lines at 8 P.M. that evening, but went missing shortly afterwards. Upon being found at 11 P.M., he refused to return to the front line. He was subsequently arrested for disobeying orders, and on 1 October 1916 tried by court martial at Ville-sur-Ancre. He had to defend himself against the formal accusation of 'misbehaving before the enemy in such a manner as to show cowardice'. The Divisional court martial, presided over by Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Spring, the Commanding Officer of the 11th (Service) Battalion of the Essex Regiment, lasted 20 minutes, and questions have subsequently been raised about its competence. The hearing found Farr guilty and sentenced him to death. General Sir Douglas Haig, as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force subsequently confirmed the execution order, and Farr was shot by a firing squad made up from men of his own regiment at 6.00 A.M. on 18 October 1916, near Carnoy on the Somme. His family have always argued that he was suffering from shell shock at the time."]}, {"page": "Spring family", "response": ["The Conservative politician Lord Risby (b.1946) is the most recent member of the family to represent Suffolk in the British Parliament.
