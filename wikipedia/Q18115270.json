Early in the action a Mini\u00e9 ball struck Shirley and became embedded in his prayer book, doing him no harm. As the regiment advanced to support William Norcott with some of the Rifle Brigade and crossed the River Alma, Shirley was ordered by Sir George Buller to have the regiment form square to repel a cavalry attack that never materialised. This allowed part of the 1st Division to overtake them so that the Rangers saw little further action at the battle."]}, {"page": "Cornelius Buller", "response": ["Buller was from a prominent Cornish family that included Sir Richard Buller, General Sir George Buller, General Sir Redvers Buller and the Barons Churston.

This led General Buller to take Egerton's word and follow suit with the other regiments. This action saved many of the British forces during the battle."]}]}}
