Molloy was initially cast in the role by director Matthew Robinson, who had worked with him before and thought his talent for voices would be ideal to recreate the part first played by Michael Wisher. Molloy also appeared in the Doctor Who story Attack of the Cybermen (1985) as an undercover policeman named Russell, again cast by Robinson. In recent years, Molloy has reprised the role of Davros in the Big Finish Productions audio dramas Davros, The Juggernauts, Terror Firma, Masters of War, The Davros Mission, The Curse of Davros, and the four-part miniseries I, Davros. He also played Davros in a 2005 stage production, The Trial of Davros.

Ricky was not killed off in the serial, as the producers opted to give the actor an open-ended storyline, enabling him to return. An EastEnders' spokesperson claimed that \"Owen's decision to take a break from filming had been reached in mutual agreement with EastEnders' bosses\". Owen stated, \"I love playing Ricky Butcher but it will be good to take off his overalls for a while. After 12 years, two failed marriages and two children, I'm looking forward to some time off - but also my return to Walford.\" Executive producer at the time, Matthew Robinson, said, \"Viewers have come to love the character of Ricky Butcher due to Sid's wonderful acting. We wish Sid luck in any forthcoming projects and look forward to welcoming Ricky back to EastEnders in due course.\""]}, {"page": "Matthew Rose (EastEnders)", "response": ["Matthew's most prominent storyline spans a year and begins on the Valentine's day episode in February 1999. After developing a friendship with club owner Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Matthew is present to witness Steve accidentally killing his ex-girlfriend Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) by hitting her on the head with a marbel ashtray following her jealous attack on him. Saskia's death was first screened in a lengthened 45-minute episode on a Sunday evening, deviating from EastEnders' typical broadcasting weekday slots. Executive producer Matthew Robinson has alleged that Saskia's death scene had to be reshot because it was deemed too violent: \"When we played back the film, it was fantastic - too fantastic. It looked so real that I knew we couldn't broadcast it. EastEnders goes out before the nine o'clock watershed, children watch it - and we can't show outright scenes of graphic violence. We had to do the whole thing again. It took almost two hours and the three actors were emotionally and physically exhausted. In the end we got what we wanted.\" After the killing, Steve fears that police will not believe it was an accident, convinces Matthew to help him cover-up the death and they bundle Saskia's body into a bin liner and bury it in a wood. Robinson said, \"This is an exciting plot and it'll keep us occupied for much of the next year.\"", "Absolom announced he was quitting the role in October 1999. Absolom stated that he had enjoyed his time on the soap but believed it was the right time to move on, suggesting that the storyline airing at the time, his wrongful imprisonment for murder, would have been difficult to advance. He commented, \"I think people are getting quite bored of it. I've cried so many times on telly, that people just go, `he's crying again', it's not like anything new now.\" Absolom remained on-screen until February 2000. Executive producer of EastEnders, Matthew Robinson, said of the actor, \"Joe Absolom has made a huge contribution to EastEnders, culminating in the huge success of the recent trial and verdict storylines\" and he added that the door would be left open for a future return. Absolom commented in 2000, \"I've been told the door is always open for me, so you never know. Also, I hope to still see some of the cast, so I like to think it won't be my last visit.\""]}, {"page": "The Nightmare Fair", "response": ["The Nightmare Fair is a story originally written for the 1986 season of Doctor Who, but never filmed.
