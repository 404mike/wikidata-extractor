The murders are invariably violent and gory, featuring a variety of explicit and imaginative attacks. These scenes frequently evoke some degree of voyeurism, sometimes going so far as to present the murder from the first-person perspective of the killer, with the black-gloved hand holding a knife viewed from the killer's point of view. The murders often occur when the victim is most vulnerable (showering, taking a bath, or scantily clad); as such, giallo films often include liberal amounts of nudity and sex, almost all of it featuring beautiful young women (actresses associated with the genre include Edwige Fenech, Barbara Bach, Daria Nicolodi, Mimsy Farmer, Barbara Bouchet, Suzy Kendall, Ida Galli and Anita Strindberg). Due to the titillating emphasis on explicit sex and violence, gialli are sometimes categorized as exploitation cinema. The association of female sexuality and brutal violence has led some commentators to accuse the genre of misogyny.", "* Suzy Kendall"]}, {"page": "Nikki van der Zyl", "response": ["*Fr\u00e4ulein Doktor (1969, revoiced Suzy Kendall)"]}, {"page": "Harry Alan Towers", "response": ["| Christopher Lee, Leo Genn, Heinz Drache, Klaus Kinski, Margaret Lee, Suzy Kendall, Cecil Parker, Eddi Arent"]}, {"page": "List of female movie actors by name: J\u2013K", "response": ["*Suzy Kendall (born 1944)"]}, {"page": "Tom Mankiewicz", "response": ["In his book, Mankiewicz claimed he lost his virginity to Joan O'Brien while making The Comancheros.
