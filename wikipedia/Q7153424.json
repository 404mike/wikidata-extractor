Sample trained and played at Notre Dame for 4 years before signing for the Boston Harbourwolves when he was 18 years old.\nHe returned to the UK to the Elite League with the Belfast Giants in 2003, scoring 18 goals and 40 points in 61 games. Sample won a number of accolades with the Belfast Giants including Most Valuable Player and Player of the Season. After one season in Belfast, Sample signed with the Sheffield Steelers where his offensive numbers were greatly shortened, scoring just 4 goals and 9 points in 59 games. Despite this, Sample stayed with the Steelers for a second season before rejoining the Cardiff Devils who were now members of the Elite League. With 13 goals and 31 points in the 2006\u201307, Sample was on target to return to his high-scoring day with Belfast, until he suffered a knee injury during the 07\u201308 season which kept him out for the remainder of the season and effectively ended his spell with the Devils. In 2008, Sample re-signed with the Giants.\nOn 27 May 2009, Sample retired from hockey to pursue other interests, but he would then come out of retirement and sign for his hometown team the Newcastle Vipers on 18 May 2010 for the 2010\u201311 season. At the conclusion of the season however, the Vipers folded and Sample retired for a second time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Athol Murray College of Notre Dame", "response": ["* Paul Sample"]}, {"page": "Paul Sample", "response": ["Paul Sample may refer to:", "* Paul Sample (artist) (1896-1974), American artist known for artwork depicting 20th century New England", "* Paul Sample (cartoonist) (born 1947), British cartoonist known for his strip Ogri", "* Paul Sample (ice hockey) (born 1982), British ice hockey player"]}]}}
