He was first recorded in the 1940s by folk music researcher Alan Lomax and, over subsequent decades endeared himself to the English folk-song revival movement.  Jordan was awarded the English Folk Dance and Song Society's highest honour, the Gold Badge, \"for distinguished and unique contributions to the folk performing arts\" in 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shropshire", "response": ["* Fred Jordan farm worker from Ludlow and one of the great traditional English singers"]}, {"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*Fred Jordan"]}, {"page": "John Barleycorn", "response": ["Many field recordings of the song were made of traditional singers performing the song, mostly in England.

Connell and C. Gibson, Sound Tracks: Popular Music, Identity, and Place (Routledge, 2003), pp. 34\u20136. The key figures were Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd. The second revival was generally left wing in politics and emphasised the work music of the 19th century and previously neglected forms like erotic folk songs. Topic Records, founded in 1939, provided a major source of folk recordings. The revival resulted in the foundation of a network of folk clubs in major towns, from the 1950s.B.

Dowell, World Music: The Rough Guide (London: Rough Guides, 1999), pp. 66\u20138 and 79\u201380.
