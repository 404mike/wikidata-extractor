The score heard in Hard Boiled was created by jazz musician Michael Gibbs. During promotional screenings, the score for the film was different and was described as \"very haunting music\". This score could not be used as the production crew could not get the rights to the music. Other songs featured in the film, include \"Hello\" by Lionel Richie and the traditional song \"Mona Lisa\". Woo chose these songs specifically for their lyrics to suggest that Tony was a sort of pen pal to Teresa.Hall, 1999. p.164 All the characters in Hard Boiled had their voices dubbed by their own actors to save money.
