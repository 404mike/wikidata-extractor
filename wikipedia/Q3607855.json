Later that day there were reports that units of the Italian Fleet were approaching.

The convoy arrived in Malta without further incident, and Prince of Wales returned to Gibraltar, before sailing on to Scapa Flow, arriving there on 6 October."]}, {"page": "North America and West Indies Station", "response": ["* Vice Admiral Sir Alban Curteis (1942\u201344)"]}, {"page": "Operation Sportpalast", "response": ["On 3 March a force under the Home Fleet's deputy commander Vice-Admiral Alban Curteis departed Iceland to protect the convoys. It comprised the battleship , battlecruiser  and six destroyers. Tovey was on board King George V at the fleet's main base at Scapa Flow. He preferred to remain there with the battleship and Victorious to remain in contact by telephone with his sources of intelligence and intercept Tirpitz if she attempted to break out into the Atlantic. Retaining part of the fleet at Scapa Flow would also help to keep ships and their crews combat ready over what was anticipated to be a lengthy campaign, with Tovey believing that Gneisenau and Scharnhorst would join Tirpitz over the summer after they were repaired. The Admiralty disagreed with this strategy and ordered Tovey to put to sea on 3 March so that the full force of the Home Fleet could be brought to bear against Tirpitz if she sailed. In doing so it accepted responsibility for the consequences if the German battleship entered the Atlantic. Tovey  sailed shortly afterwards with King George V, Victorious, Berwick and six destroyers. The two main elements of the Home Fleet met up to the east of Jan Mayen on 6 June. Tovey was under orders to give precedence to protecting the convoys over destroying Tirpitz. He was unhappy with this, and regarded the sinking of the battleship as being of \"incomparably greater importance to the conduct of the war than the safety of any convoy\". The forces under Tovey's command were considerably more powerful than those available to Ciliax."]}, {"page": "Operation Harpoon (1942)", "response": ["* Force W, covering force Vice-Admiral  Alban Curteis (All data cited to O'Hara (2013) unless specified.)"]}, {"page": "2nd Battle Squadron", "response": ["* Vice-Admiral Sir Alban Curteis (1941\u201342)"]}, {"page": "8th Cruiser Squadron", "response": ["|9 || Vice-Admiral || 25px ||Alban Curteis ||April 1942-July 1942||"]}, {"page": "Alban (given name)", "response": ["*Alban Curteis (1887\u20131961), English Royal Navy officer"]}]}}
