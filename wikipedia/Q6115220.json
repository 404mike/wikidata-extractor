Jack became one of the Blades most popular players, always remembered for his cheerful grin. Not for nothing he was nicknamed Smiler.\nBetween 1935 and 1949, he made 203 consecutive appearances for United. Smith played for Sheffield United for 19 years, and in the final match of the 1948\u201349 season - a County Cup match against Barnsley he was chaired from the field.\nThis was to have been his last appearance for the Blades, but he played a few matches the following season and his final match was a Division 2 match away at Grimsby Town played on 14 May 1949.", "link_mentions": {}}}
