Jack became one of the Blades most popular players, always remembered for his cheerful grin. Not for nothing he was nicknamed Smiler.\nBetween 1935 and 1949, he made 203 consecutive appearances for United. Smith played for Sheffield United for 19 years, and in the final match of the 1948\u201349 season - a County Cup match against Barnsley he was chaired from the field.\nThis was to have been his last appearance for the Blades, but he played a few matches the following season and his final match was a Division 2 match away at Grimsby Town played on 14 May 1949.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Smith", "response": ["Jack Smith may refer to:", "*Jack Smith (Port Vale), footballer in 1892\u20131895", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1882) (1882 \u2013 after 1911), English player with Wolverhampton Wanderers and others", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1895) (1895\u20131946), Scottish player with Bolton Wanderers", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u20131977), English international footballer", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1901), English footballer for Bradford City and Blackburn Rovers", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1910) (1910\u20131986), English player with Sheffield United", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1911) (1911\u20131975), Welsh player with Wolves; manager of West Bromwich Albion and Reading", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u20131975), English player with Manchester United", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1936) (1936\u20132008), English player with Swindon Town", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1983), English player ", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1994), Scottish player", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 2001), English player", "*Jack Smith (Australian footballer, born 1881) (1881\u20131927), Australian rules footballer for North Melbourne and Melbourne", "*Jack Smith (Australian footballer, born 1909) (1909\u20131983), Australian rules footballer for St Kilda and North Melbourne", "*Jack Smith (end) (1917\u20132015), American football end", "*Jack Smith (defensive back) (born 1947), American football player", "*Jack Smith (American racing driver, born 1924) (1924\u20132001), American NASCAR driver", "*Jack Smith (American racing driver, born 1973) (born 1973), American NASCAR driver", "*Jack Smith (Australian racing driver) (born 1999), Australian racing driver", "*Jack Smith (sportsman) (1936\u20132020), English cricketer and rugby union player", "*Jack Smith (Australian cricketer) (born 1977), Australian cricketer", "*Jack Smith (outfielder) (1895\u20131972), Major League Baseball player", "*Jack Smith (pitcher) (1935\u20132021), Major League Baseball player", "*Jack Smith (third baseman) (1893\u20131962), Major League Baseball player", "*Jack Smith (coach), American college football, baseball and basketball coach for Hofstra", "*Jack Smith (speedway rider) (born 1998), British speedway rider", "*Jack Smith (wheelchair rugby) (born 1991), British Paralympian", "*Whispering Jack Smith (1896\u20131950), American musician", "*Smilin' Jack Smith (1913\u20132006), American crooner, radio/television host and actor", "*Jack Smith (columnist) (1916\u20131996), Los Angeles journalist", "*John O'Neill (musician) (1926\u20131999), English musician credited as Whistling Jack Smith", "*Jack Smith (film director) (1932\u20131989), American underground film director", "*Jack Smith (politician) (1901\u20131967), Liberal party member of the Canadian House of Commons", "*Jack Smith (artist) (1928\u20132011), British abstract artist", "*Jack Smith (Pentagon), medical doctor; served as Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Clinical and Program Policy", "*Jack Smith (Hotmail), co-founder of Hotmail", "*Jack Smith (American Dad!), character in U.S. animated TV series American Dad!"]}, {"page": "Jack Smith (footballer born 1910)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Smith (footballer, born 1910)"]}]}}
