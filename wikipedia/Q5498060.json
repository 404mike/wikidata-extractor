He played first-class cricket in two matches, one in each of the 1882 and 1883 seasons. He was born at Bath, Somerset and died at Cricket Malherbie, also in Somerset.\nHotham was a right-handed lower-order batsman. Nearly all of his cricket was played for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) or Hertfordshire and was not first-class. But in 1882 and 1883 he played without success in the MCC first-class matches against Somerset at Lord's, in 1882 turning out for Somerset, for which he was qualified by birth, but in 1883 playing against Somerset for the MCC side. He was pretty even-handed in his lack of success for the two teams, making 10 runs in two innings for Somerset and eight runs (plus a catch) for MCC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Frederick Hotham (1882) 1 match CA"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Frederick Hotham (1883) : F.
