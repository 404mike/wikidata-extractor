City won four straight home matches but also lost 5\u20131 to West Ham, 5\u20130 at Newcastle, and most significantly 4\u20130 to local rivals Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park. He found it difficult to control the club's talented and popular players, as Dziekanowski regularly got into trouble in his social life and skilled left-winger Junior Bent was unwilling to deliver crosses as regularly as Smith demanded. He tried to sell Bent but was unable to have the deal sanctioned by the club's directors. His relationship with the board was poor and he found himself regularly undermined and sensitive boardroom discussions were leaked. He also tried to sell Cole in order to provide funds to restructure the first team but again the board refused to sanction the deal. He was dismissed on 21 January 1993 following a run of 10 matches without a victory, and his assistant Russell Osman was appointed as his successor."]}, {"page": "Stuart McCall", "response": ["Dolan brought in Paul Tomlinson, Brian Mitchell and Lee Sinnott in a bid to help McCall and Hendrie realise their dreams with City. They mounted a promotion challenge in 1987\u201388 and were top for much of the season until they faltered in the New Year. When promotion was missed initially by one point on the last day of the season after a 3\u20132 defeat against Ipswich Town and then through play-off defeat to Middlesbrough, McCall left the club, signing for Everton for \u00a3850,000 in June 1988. He had played 238 league games for the club, scoring 37 goals, and in total played 285 games, scoring 46 goals. McCall was later outspoken in his autobiography, The Real McCall, about City's failure to strengthen the side to secure promotion."]}, {"page": "Brian Mitchell", "response": ["Brian Mitchell may refer to:", "*Brian Mitchell (boxer) (born 1961), former professional boxer", "*Brian Mitchell (kicker) (born 1969), college football player, Marshall University in 1987, University of Northern Iowa 1989\u20131991", "*Brian Mitchell (running back) (born 1968), former American football running back and return specialist", "*Brian Mitchell (American football coach) (born 1968), American football coach and former cornerback", "*Brian Mitchell (cricketer) (born 1959), Australian cricketer", "*Brian Mitchell (footballer) (born 1963), Scottish former professional footballer", "*Brian Mitchell (musician), keyboard and accordion player, Brian Mitchell Band", "*Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon, British comedy writing team", "*Brian Mitchell (politician) (born 1967), Australian politician"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Brian Mitchell||||1987\u20131992||178||5||"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Brian Mitchell"]}, {"page": "1985 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||3||Brian Mitchell"]}]}}
