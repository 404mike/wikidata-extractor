He worked for Shell and London Transport, designing posters and advertisements, and as a cartoonist for Punch magazine. During the Second World War, he served as a camouflage officer in the Western Desert. He taught at Chelsea College of Art before and after the war, before becoming head of illustration at the Royal College of Art.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Operation Bertram", "response": ["Different techniques were used for each task. The British Army had intentionally recruited designers, architects and artists for camouflage work.Stroud, 2012. p31. Tony Ayrton was a painter, son of the architect Maxwell Ayrton. Brian Robb had arrived more informally: he joined the army as a private, but Barkas noticed him and made use of his skills as an artist, teacher and illustrator by having him speedily promoted to Staff Lieutenant. Ayrton and Robb became Barkas's \"GSO2\"s, his senior staff officers, and they supervised the camouflage schemes used in Operation Bertram.Barkas, 1952.  pp. 186-187, 212.", "Field guns and their limbers were disguised as British \"3-tonner\" trucks, under the direction of Tony Ayrton and Brian Robb. They arranged for the long towing pole of the limber to overlap the trail of the gun and then put up a dummy truck canopy over both. The real wheels of both the gun and the limber added to the realism of the dummy truck, as they remained visible under the canopy, exactly where the truck's wheels ought to be. The technique was named \"Cannibal\" because the gun and limber were 'eaten up' by the canopy.Barkas, 1952. p200\u2013201.", "While the real supplies in the north were carefully hidden, matching dummy supplies had to be created in the south. In the area named Brian after camouflage officer Brian Robb, over 700 dummy stacks, representing food, petrol, ammunition and other supplies, were constructed.Barkas, 1952. p206."]}, {"page": "James Roose-Evans", "response": ["The Odd and Elsewhere series was illustrated by Brian Robb."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampstead", "response": ["*Brian Robb (English artist, illustrator and cartoonist)For sources, see the References section of his page."]}, {"page": "List of camoufleurs", "response": ["| Brian Robb || 1913\u201379 || English painter, illustrator, Punch cartoonist;  camouflage in Western Desert, Operation Bertram 1942Rankin, 2008. pp 365\u2013366.Crowdy, 2008. pp 178\u2013181."]}, {"page": "Tony Ayrton", "response": ["Ayrton was gazetted an officer in the Royal Engineers, on 3 December 1939. He was responsible for forming No. 85 South African Camouflage Company, and in early 1941 he was one of only five fully trained camouflage officers in the whole of the British middle east.Barkas, 1952. p107. The Director of Camouflage for Middle East Command, Geoffrey Barkas, quickly had him seconded to his team, followed by the whole of No. 85 Camouflage Company.Stroud, 2012. p86. On 17 July 1942, Barkas made Ayrton his deputy, replacing the brilliant camoufleur Steven Sykes, who was exhausted and ill.Stroud, 2012. p165.Sykes, 1990. p97. Still short of camouflage officers, Barkas heard of a private soldier, Brian Robb, who was known to be skilful at drawing, and finding him enthusiastic and likeable, quickly brought him to General Headquarters in Cairo and had him promoted to Staff Lieutenant.Stroud, 2012. p181.", "Ayrton planned and supervised the building of the \"Diamond\" dummy pipeline, which ran southwards to help give Rommel the impression that an Armoured Corps was massing in the south. Ayrton convinced Richardson that Camouflage could implement this despite the shortage of time and materials. Ayrton's plan was to flatten and join thousands of the non-returnable 4-gallon petrol cans to make 5 miles of dummy pipe, which was laid in a trench and left for one day. The next night, the trench was filled in, and the pipe laid in a trench 5 miles further south. The trench remained about 10 miles short of its destination - the southern part of the British front line - on 23 September, showing Rommel that the pipeline and the attack were not ready. To give the pipeline realism, Ayrton planned dummy overhead storage tanks, pumphouses, and filling stations complete with dummy men and trucks. This activity was reinforced by a large dummy dump named Brian for Ayrton's cheerful assistant, Brian Robb.Richardson, 1985. p116.Stroud, 2012. pp192-197."]}, {"page": "Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate", "response": ["| Masquerade (stores as truck, tent) || net-covered stack || real stores, canvas, nets || Operation Bertram  || Geoffrey Barkas, Tony Ayrton, Brian Robb"]}]}}
