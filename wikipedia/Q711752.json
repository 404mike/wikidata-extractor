He competed in chess tournaments between 1870 and 1895, playing against most of the world's leading players, but with only modest success. The writer G. H. Diggle calls him \"the King of Wooden Spoonists\" because he usually finished last in strong tournaments.\nGossip was also a noted writer. His treatise The Chess-Player's Manual\u2014A Complete Guide to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 after several years of work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number of informal skittles games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual was one of the best available books on the game. Thanks in part to a 122-page appendix by S. Lipsch\u00fctz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time.\nGossip made his living primarily as a journalist, author, and translator. He wrote for publications in England, France, Australia, and the United States. At various times he resided in each of those countries, as well as in Germany and Canada. In 1898 and 1899, two publishers issued Gossip's sole book about a subject other than chess, The Jew of Chamant. Published under the pseudonym \"Ivan Trepoff\", it was virulently antisemitic.\nChess writers have often mocked Gossip's play, calling him a \"grandpatzer\" and the like. Kenneth Whyld, however, one of his previous critics, suggests that history may have judged his strength unfairly.", "link_mentions": {}}}
