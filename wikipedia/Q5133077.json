Charles Keating was Cloten. As with contemporary productions of Pericles, this one used a narrator (Cornelius) to signal changes in mood and treatment to the audience. Robert Speaight disliked the set design, which he called too minimal, but he approved the acting."]}, {"page": "Rolf Hochhuth", "response": ["The play was first performed in Berlin on 20 February 1963 under the direction of Erwin Piscator.

After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member of the company and found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors.Hordern, p. 144. Writing in his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote: \"Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land.\"Hordern, p. 145. Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose,\"The Slipper and the Rose\", British Film Institute, accessed 18 February 2016. and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre.\"Jumpers\", The Spectator, 1 October 1976, p. 28. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren \"enjoyed it immoderately\" and thought the revival revealed a \"tidier play than it look[ed]\". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: \"It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent.\""]}, {"page": "Royal National Theatre", "response": ["* As You Like It directed by Clifford Williams, the all-male production with Ronald Pickup as Rosalind, Jeremy Brett as Orlando, Charles Kay as Celia, Derek Jacobi as Touchstone, Robert Stephens as Jaques (1967)"]}, {"page": "Royal Shakespeare Company", "response": ["John Barton had been appointed associate director in January 1960, and was followed in 1962 by Michel Saint-Denis, Peter Brook and Clifford Williams who joined the company as resident directors.

In 1964, for example, they screened a live performance of Clifford Williams' Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) production of The Comedy of Errors from the Aldwych Theatre, starring Ian Richardson as Antipholus of Ephesus and Alec McCowen as Antipholus of Syracuse. 1964 also saw the broadcast of Hamlet at Elsinore, directed by Philip Saville and produced by Peter Luke. Starring Christopher Plummer as Hamlet, Robert Shaw as Claudius and June Tobin as Gertrude, the entire play was shot on-location in Helsing\u00f8r at the real Elsinore Castle.
