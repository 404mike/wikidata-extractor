A right-handed batsman, he made 18,533 runs at 29.79 in his 362-game career.\nBorn in Queensbury, West Yorkshire, Horner was a neat, dapper batsman, who formed a powerful opening partnership with Fred Gardner, and scored a thousand runs in every season up to 1964.  M.J.K. Smith commented that \"Norman would have run Fred's legs off him if he had been allowed\". He went down the order in 1958, when the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) asked Warwickshire to promote Smith to develop him for a possible England opening spot.  Horner scored quickly, and enjoyed his best three seasons from 1959 to 1961.  On a flat Oval pitch in 1960 he scored a career-best 203 not out, and put on 377 with Billy Ibadulla for the first wicket on the first day, then the highest unbroken opening partnership in cricket history. He was quick in the covers and took 131 catches. He retired in 1965 to concentrate on landscape gardening and his work as a cricket groundsman.\nHorner died in Driffield, Yorkshire in December 2003, at the age of 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Ibadulla", "response": ["On a flat Oval pitch in 1960 he scored an unbeaten 170 for Warwickshire against Surrey, and put on 377 with Norman Horner for the first wicket on the first day, then the highest unbroken opening partnership in cricket history."]}, {"page": "Playfair Cricket Annual", "response": ["* 1961: Trevor Bailey, Ted Dexter, Norman Horner, Henry Horton, Tony Lewis, Alan Moss, Michael Norman, Eric Russell, Brian Statham, Fred Trueman, Peter Wight"]}, {"page": "Anthony Allom", "response": ["He also played three Second XI Championship matches and seven Minor Counties Championship games for Surrey Second XI.
