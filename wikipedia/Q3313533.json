For \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", he and recording engineer Geoff Emerick turned two very different takes into a single master through careful use of vari-speed and editing. For \"I Am the Walrus\", he provided a quirky and original arrangement for brass, violins, cellos, and the Mike Sammes Singers vocal ensemble.

The shows featured his relaxed crooner style, sitting in a rocking chair wearing cardigans or jumpers, sometimes performing comedic Irish songs including \"Paddy McGinty's Goat\", \"Delaney's Donkey\" and \"O'Rafferty's Motor Car\" as well as easy listening and country material on which he accompanied himself on acoustic guitar. Doonican's songs about O'Rafferty were popular enough for the BBC to publish a book, Val Doonican Tells The Adventures of O'Rafferty, which retold five of the tales, in 1969.
