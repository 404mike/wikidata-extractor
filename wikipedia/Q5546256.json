At the time, he was a fast, goal-scoring left winger.\nWartime service restricted his appearances to 43 games and 14 goals, until the 1947\u201348 season, when he was demobbed and became Gateshead's regular centre forward. He played at Redheugh Park in the heyday of Gateshead's FA Cup runs, notably in 1952 and 1953 when they reached the fourth and sixth rounds, but was missing through injury for the game against Bolton Wanderers in 1953 when Gateshead lost only to a disputed Nat Lofthouse goal. Bolton went on to play at Wembley in the famous Matthews final.\nIt was said at the time that if Wilbert had played, history may well have been different as he had played brilliantly in the previous rounds, particularly in the fifth against Plymouth Argyle, which Gateshead won 1\u20130.\nHe left Gateshead in the 1954\u201355 season to work for the Forestry Commission in Northumberland.\nHe scored a total of 97 goals in 285 appearances in the league and FA Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Gateshead F.C. seasons", "response": ["|George Wilbert", "|George Wilbert", "|George Wilbert", "|George Wilbert"]}, {"page": "Wilbert, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Wilbert"]}]}}
