His death effectively ended the hereditary succession of the Felbrigg estates which had run uninterrupted for 350 years. The Felbrigg estate was left to Windham's wife Cecilia Windham in the first instance for the remainder of her life. Thereafter, William Windham's heir was Vice Admiral William Lukin. Lukin was related to Windham as he was the grandson of William Windham's mother by her first marriage. After his retirement from the Navy, Lukin settled back to north Norfolk, to a small estate farm at Metton which was close to Felbrigg. Lukin and his wife Anne settled into family life with their 12 children. With six sons and six daughters to raise the Lukins soon found finances were stretched and as a consequence in 1820 Lukin moved to Brussels with his family to save money. On 5 May 1824, Cecilia Windham died and William Lukin inherited Felbrigg. At the same time he changed his name, assuming the name Windham along with the family coat of arms. The estate and house were finally woken from fourteen years of slumber. William Lukin Windham, as he was now called, employed architect W. J. Donthorne to remodel, extend, and alter the house and stable block. The Admiral remained at the Hall and led a quiet life until his death in 1833. Two of his sons William Howe Windham (the eldest) and Charles Ash Windham represented East Norfolk in Parliament; the latter fought in the Crimean War and rose to the rank of General.
