She worked for the engineering firm Metropolitan-Vickers (formerly British Westinghouse) from 1916 to 1959, retiring after forty-three years at the company. She was the second woman to gain Full Membership of the Institution of Electrical Engineers since Hertha Ayrton in 1899 and was a prominent member of the Manchester branch of the Women's Engineering Society.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hertha Ayrton", "response": ["In the late nineteenth century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem.  In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for the Electrician, explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). Her paper was entitled \"The Hissing of the Electric Arc\". Shortly thereafter, Ayrton was elected the first female member of the IEE; the next woman to be admitted to the IEE was Dorothy Smith in 1958. She petitioned to present a paper before the Royal Society but was not allowed because of her sex and \"The Mechanism of the Electric Arc\" was read by John Perry in her stead in 1901. Ayrton was also the first woman to win a prize from the Society, the Hughes Medal, awarded to her in 1906 in honour of her research on the motion of ripples in sand and water and her work on the electric arc. By the late nineteenth century, Ayrton's work in the field of electrical engineering was recognised more widely, domestically and internationally. At the International Congress of Women held in London in 1899, she presided over the physical science section. Ayrton also spoke at the International Electrical Congress in Paris in 1900. Her success there led the British Association for the Advancement of Science to allow women to serve on general and sectional committees."]}, {"page": "Dorothy Smith", "response": ["Dorothy Smith may refer to:", "*Dorothy Smith (gymnast) (born 1919), British Olympic gymnast", "*Dorothy Smith (Lady Pakington) (died 1639)", "*Dorothy Smith (1898-1975), British electrical engineer"]}, {"page": "Manchester High School for Girls", "response": ["*Dorothy Smith electrical engineer, worked for the engineering firm Metropolitan-Vickers, second woman to gain Full Membership of the Institution of Electrical Engineers."]}, {"page": "Gertrude Lilian Entwisle", "response": ["In 1937, Entwistle served as an opposition member at a meeting of the Metropolitan-Vickers Debating Society, arguing against the motion \u201cThat the Introduction of Female Apprentices to these works is to be deplored.\u201d She was joined in her opposition by Dorothy Garfitt, Anne Gillespie Shaw, and Dorothy Smith, fellow Metropolitan-Vickers employees and members of the Women's Engineering Society.

Subsequently, she served as chairman for the session 1947 to 1948. As chairman, she gave the first talk organised by the Manchester branch in that year, an address entitled \"Lighten Our Darkness\", that introduced the theory of relativity. She was editor of the society's journal, The Woman Engineer, from 1952 to 1956. She went on to serve as the vice president of the society from 1956 to 1960 and as president from 1961 to 1962. She succeeded Madeleine Nobbs in the role and was succeeded in turn by Cicely Thompson. From 1966 to 1973, she was honorary secretary to the society.
