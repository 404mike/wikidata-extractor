He exhibited at the Society of Painters in Water-colours, showing some landscapes in 1815, and cattle pieces in 1818. He is best known for his paintings and engravings of animals. Besides painting in water-colours, he also made etchings, aquatints, and lithographs, becoming especially proficient in the last of these. He moved to Paris where he lived until his death, on 12 January 1856; he was much esteemed there, entering the 1827 Paris Salon and teaching the family of Louis-Philippe. In 1836 he published in London a set of Subjects after Nature, and in Paris he published sets of lithographs of animals, and illustrations to various works."]}, {"page": "Nathan Fielding", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nathan Theodore Fielding"]}, {"page": "Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding", "response": ["Fielding was the eldest son of Nathan Theodore Fielding. Like his brothers Copley and Thales he painted in watercolours, and in 1799 sent to the Royal Academy A View of the North Tyne, near Billingham, Northumberland. In 1814 he sent to the British Institution A Sleeping Bacchus. He continued to exhibit at both exhibitions, but it is sometimes difficult to distinguish his works from those of his younger brother, Thales Fielding."]}, {"page": "Theodore Nathan Fielding", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nathan Theodore Fielding"]}]}}
