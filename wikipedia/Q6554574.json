It includes early 19th century photographic examples of the medium\u2019s development by practitioners, among them Linnaeus Tripe, Julia Margaret Cameron, and a rare collection of photographs from The 1851 Great Exhibition of Works of Industry of all Nations,  also known as the Crystal Palace exhibition in London, England.
