He then turned his attention to general editorial portraiture for The Observer and The Guardian. He is perhaps most well known for his photographic contribution to the weekly Guardian Profile.His work encompasses a huge variety of subjects and topics, but he has largely concentrated on portraits of those in the arts. These include actors (such as Morgan Freeman and Anthony Hopkins); writers (such as Ian McEwan and Iris Murdoch); poets (such as Carol Ann Duffy and Seamus Heaney); artists (such as Grayson Perry and David Hockney); and musicians (such as James Brown and Patti Smith). McCabe also ventured into sports photography, capturing figures in action, such as the table tennis player Li Chen Shi and footballer Diego Maradona. It was as a sports photographer that McCabe was attending the 1985 European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus, but he ended up being a news photographer as he found himself taking the famous but tragic images of the Heysel Stadium disaster.McCabe also worked as the picture editor for Decade, Phaidon's photographic review of the first ten years of the new Millennium. He is Visiting Senior Fellow in Photography at the University of Suffolk, holds an Honorary Doctorate of the University of East Anglia and Staffordshire University, and is an Honorary Professor at Thames Valley University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Fashion Awards", "response": ["    Eamonn McCabe"]}, {"page": "Robert Gallagher", "response": ["Gallagher attended the Newcastle School of Art and Design, inspired by the work of W.

He was  influential on the younger generation who, as Eamonn McCabe reports \"can count themselves lucky: he is a man of immense charm and warmth and he knows the problems his students have to face. Sadler notes that;Gaskins was leading a course now regarded as initiating a revival of both landscape and creative\u00a0photography in Britain at that time. The course was simultaneously laying the cornerstone of a new style of photographic education, the effects of which are still being felt today. For John, this meant the sharing of his technical expertise and his creative ideas in the teaching of students. The course required and encouraged both tutors and students to achieve photographic excellence in liaison with cutting edge organisations of the day. These ideals appealed to John, and he worked hard at their achievement. The 1970s saw public support of and interest in photography that led to the establishment of galleries, Arts Council bursaries and the publishing of photographic books.In 1977, Colin Thomas, founded a community project, Aware Photographic Arts, based in Liverpool's Lark Lane, where John Blakemore and others conducted workshops for thousands of disadvantaged participants from young children and unemployed adults to pensioners and  exhibited the work in supermarkets and old peoples homes, libraries and at festivals. Blakemore, twenty years after its foundation wrote that Aware; \"not only understands and utilises the democracy of the image, but lives in a democracy based on access for all\".Bill Harpe, \"He took photography to area rarely touched by it: Colin Thomas,\" obituary, The Guardian, 12 Jun 2003, p.25 ", "From 1985 he was one of the contributors, with Peter Turner, Fay Godwin and Lewis Baltz, to workshops at The Photographer's Place in Derby, and in 1991 with Godwin, Derry Brabbs and Thomas Joshua Cooper at Inversnaid Lodge near Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. In 1990 he also gave printing demonstrations and workshops to members of the RPS in his own darkroom at 2 Ferrestone Road, Hornsey, and in 1992 presented Master classes at Duckspool Photographers, Somerset, with Paul Hill, Fay Godwin, Martin Parr, Eamonn McCabe, Peter Goldfield, Tom Cooper, Brian Griffin, Roger Mayne, and Sue Davies.
