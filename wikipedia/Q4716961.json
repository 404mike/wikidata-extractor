Michael Billington wrote, in his review for The Guardian, \"You sense a bond of buried affection between James Lailey's guilt-ridden Gerry and [Pearson] as the bridling bride-to-be. In fact, all the performances from director Heather Williams's largely Bristol-based cast are good.\" Metro described it as \"a fantastic success \u2013 for Johnson, the cast and crew, for Bristol Old Vic and for Bristol, the star of the show.\" Paul Callan of The Daily Express wrote: \"Down in the hotel Jemma panics with her pre-wedding nerves and the (very pretty) [Pearson] gives us all too recognisable Big Day nerves. She has a fine sense of comic timing and is a perfect foil for the overpowering Anita, her Sherman Tank of a mother.\" Additionally, in the autumn, she portrayed kidnapped teenager called Callie in Rachel Sternberg and Jemma Wayne's Negative Space (2009). The Evening Standard spoke highly of Pearson's performance, in which they wrote: \"The star, emphatically, is [Pearson], gamine and effulgent as Callie. Pearson is 20, but proves unsettlingly convincing as a girl not much more than half her age.\" In 2011, Pearson returned to Casualty to star as Grace Fitch,  whilst starring in David Allain's short film Will You Marry Me? (2011). In 2012, Pearson co-starred in Jen Moss' dark comedy-drama short film My Brother's Keeper (Or How Not To Survive The Apocalypse), playing the role of Jess, who is looking after her well-meaning but dim-witted brother during a zombie apocalypse. Moss would later be awarded the Best Writer and Director Awards at the Viscera Film Festival. Of Pearson's performance as Jess, Bloody Disgusting remarked that the dynamic between Alex Esmail and Pearson is both \"touching and funny\"."]}, {"page": "Luke Treadaway", "response": ["| Outstanding Ensemble (with John Boyega, Alex Esmail, Nick Frost, Nina Gold, Simon Howard, Leeon Jones, Maggie McCarthy, Danielle Vitalis & Jodie Whittaker)"]}, {"page": "List of action films of the 2010s", "response": ["|Attack the Block||Joe Cornish||Jodie Whittaker, John Boyega, Alex Esmail||United Kingdom||"]}, {"page": "Attack the Block", "response": ["* Alex Esmail as Pest, a teenage jokester, pyromaniac and loyal second-in-command of Moses's gang.
