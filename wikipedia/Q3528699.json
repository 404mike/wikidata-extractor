Joining Lancashire in 1906, he made an immediate impact with 60 wickets in his first season. He took 100 wickets in 1907 but was expensive given that virtually all pitches suited spin bowling. However, by developing fast-medium swingers of a similar style to George Hirst as a dry-weather alternative to his slow-medium spinners, Dean improved steadily to be by 1910 clearly the best bowler in the Lancashire eleven with 137 wickets. In 1911, although he was overworked when Walter Brearley was away on business, Dean went from strength to strength, taking 175 wickets in the County Championship and being by 23 wickets the leading bowler in first-class cricket (and this in spite of often resting when the fast bowler was away from business). In the six games he did partner Brearley, the two gave enough evidence that they could be formidable indeed: against Kent on a perfect wicket at Canterbury they got down eight wickets for 58 at the start and went on to take all twenty wickets in the match \u2013 Brearley twelve for 218, Dean eight for 144 \u2013 depriving Kent of a hat-trick of titles in the process.\nIn 1912, now almost exclusively bowling spin, Dean was better than ever and in wet weather carried all before him, taking 13 for 49 against Worcestershire and fifteen wickets against Kent \u2013 both at Old Trafford. Dean played three times for England that summer in the 1912 Triangular Tournament \u2013 twice against South Africa and once against Australia. Though he bowled very well in these games, with four for nineteen on a sticky wicket in the decisive Test against Australia his high point, Dean was near retirement before the next home Tests were played and was never thought likely to do well abroad.\nIn 1913, Dean was steady but rather expensive on the hard wickets, but on a rain-affected pitch in a special \u201cRoses match\u201d against Yorkshire arranged for the visit of King George V to the Aigburth ground at Liverpool, Dean accomplished one of the best performance in first-class cricket. He took nine wickets for 62 runs in the first innings, and eight for 29 in the second, and his match figures of 17 for 91 remain the best in a first-class match for Lancashire or against Yorkshire.\nIn 1914, Dean was absent for most of the first half of the season, and did only one notable performance on returning when he took 13 for 84 against a strong Hampshire side, whilst he was very disappointing in 1919. However, he surprised the critics in 1920 with a superb season, taking over 120 wickets and with Lawrence Cook helping Lancashire to second spot. He bowled very well in 1921 even if helped by some appalling batting sides, but then switched to Cheshire in the Minor Counties Championship for the 1922 & 1923 seasons.  After his retirement from playing cricket, he coached at Rossall School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 13", "response": ["*1884 \u2013 Harry Dean, English cricketer and coach (died 1957)"]}, {"page": "1911 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Harry Dean 183 @ 17.43 (BB 9\u2013109)"]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Lancashire won its first county championship in 1897, a productive bowling attack made up of Johnny Briggs, Willis Cuttell, Albert Hallam, and Arthur Mold took 420\u00a0wickets between them. In 1898 Lancashire bought the ground and some adjoining land from the de Traffords for \u00a324,732 (\u00a3 in ). In 1902, amateur and professional players began walking onto the field side by side in a break with tradition. Lancashire won its second championship title in 1904, going undefeated throughout the season; Wisden described the season as \u201cthe brightest in the history of Lancashire cricket\u201d. That season, James Hallows completed the feat of 1,000\u00a0runs and 100\u00a0wickets in the season. During the late 1900s and early 1910s, players such as Walter Brearley, Harry Dean, and Bill Huddleston were the mainstays of Lancashire bowling. The club began to experience financial problems during this same period; the increased popularity of other sports was blamed for the dip in attendances. In 1914, Lancashire sank to its lowest position of eleventh, whilst during World War I the pavilion was used by the Red Cross and 1,800 patients were treated there.", "After the war Lancashire developed a very strong batting side, including Ernest Tyldesley and Johnny Tyldesley, both Test batsmen. In 1920, Lancashire finished runner up and bowlers Harry Dean and Lawrence Cook took 274\u00a0wickets between them. During 1921, interest in cricket reached an all-time high, with over 250,000 people attending Old Trafford and over 4,500 members. 1922 was a year of contradictions, a strong team winning seven out of fifteen matches by an innings, but still managing to lose seven and finish 5th; that season Cec Parkin and Lawrence Cook mustered 308\u00a0wickets between them and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000\u00a0runs. Retrieved on 20\u00a0October 2007. Lancashire's steady progress was capped by a hat trick of championship titles between 1926 and 1928 under the captaincy of Leonard Green. In the 1926 victory, Ernest Tyldesley and Harry Makepeace each scored over 2,000\u00a0runs. In 1927, Charlie Hallows scored six centuries and the bowling attack was led by Dick Tyldesley and Ted McDonald with support from Frank Sibbles. In 1928, Frank Watson and Ernest Tyldesley scored over 2,000\u00a0runs each and George Duckworth claimed 107 victims and earned recognition as one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year. At the end of the season Leonard Green decided to retire with a record of three successive championships and 42 wins against just three defeats.

Although he still failed to achieve much against strong counties, he did a notable performance against Gloucestershire with nine for 49, and was second in the Lancashire bowling averages. 1920, however, saw Cook jump right to the top of the tree with 156 first-class wickets for less than fifteen runs each, and some notable performances in tandem with Harry Dean and Cecil Parkin, notably against Kent at Old Trafford in July. Although he did not have the honour of representing the Players or touring Australia, Cook would no doubt have been chosen as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden but for the special portrait of Pelham Warner to commemorate Middlesex's Championship win. In the dry summer of 1921, Cook showed himself to be one of the most tireless and consistent workhorses in county cricket, even if no selector thought he had enough sting to be a Test match bowler. He took 151 wickets without one haul of seven in an innings, and in 1922 he maintained his accuracy and spin notably when taking seven for 23 on a crumbling pitch."]}, {"page": "List of Lancashire County Cricket Club records", "response": ["|align=left|1.\u00a0Harry Dean2.\u00a0Walter Brearley3.\u00a0Harry Dean", "|Harry Dean || 1267"]}, {"page": "Garstang", "response": ["* Harry Dean (1884\u20131957), Lancashire cricketer who played three Test matches for England"]}, {"page": "Harry Dean", "response": ["Harry Dean may refer to:", "*Harry Dean (cricketer) (1884\u20131957), English cricketer", "*Harry Dean (musician) (1879\u20131955), Canadian conductor, pianist, organist, and music educator", "*Harry Dean (baseball) (1915\u20131960), American Major League pitcher", "*Harry Dean (politician) (1913\u20131997), Queensland politician", "*Harry Dean Stanton (1926-2017), American actor, musician and singer", "*Harry Deane (1846\u20131925), American baseball player in the National Association"]}, {"page": "100 wickets in a season", "response": ["| Harry Dean"]}, {"page": "William Pinner", "response": ["Pinner made his debut for Northamptonshire in the 1900 Minor Counties Championship against the Surrey Second XI.
