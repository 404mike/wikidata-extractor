While Bill Owen and Peter Sallis reprised their roles as Compo and Clegg, Brian Wilde chose not to take part because of personal differences with Owen. The show focused on the men's interaction with Clegg's new neighbour, Howard (Kenneth Waller), and his wife, Pearl, played by a local actress.

At the end of the first act, Marina was revealed to be a blonde sexpot.Bright and Ross (2000), pp.\u00a025\u201326 Howard and Marina's story line was partly based on an early subplot of the television show.

Despite their efforts to keep the plot a secret, especially from Mrs. Partridge's husband, the trio of old men were well aware of the affair. The summer season reversed the roles: Howard became the married partner, and the challenge was to keep the affair secret from his wife."]}, {"page": "Tickhill", "response": ["* Jean Fergusson, actress playing Marina in Last of the Summer Wine"]}, {"page": "Vaudeville Theatre", "response": ["A 1996 revival of Salad Days, starring the duo Kit and The Widow, was not successful, but Jean Fergusson's show She Knows You Know!, in which she portrayed the Lancashire comedian Hylda Baker, played at the theatre in 1997 and was nominated for a 1998 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment.Information about She Knows You Know! at the IMDB database  Showtune, a musical revue celebrating the words and music of composer Jerry Herman and conceived by Paul Gilger was given a London production at the Vaudeville in 1998 under its previous title The Best of Times.

Despite her carefree appearance, Marina is a long-suffering type, having to deal with the disapproval of the prominent village women, the indirect wrath of Pearl, and timorous and neglectful romancing by Howard. She is often thought of as a \"tart\", and not without reason.  She seems to have a soft spot for Clegg (often referring to him as \"Norman Clegg that was\" implying that they have a past), and occasionally briefly leaves Howard for other men.  In the episode \"A Double For Howard\", she is also content for Eli to kiss her when he impersonates Howard.  Marina works as a check-out girl at the local Co-op (although in more recent series, the store's name has been seen as Lodges); Howard often sneaks there to pass or receive notes from her (or more often sends Norman Clegg in his place; leading on several occasions for Marina to believe mistakenly that Clegg is interested in her romantically). In A Sidecar Named Desire Clegg reveals that he was once trapped in a lift with Marina and she cuddled him for warmth, much to Howard's ire and jealousy. Though she perceived it to be a romantic incident, it left Clegg terrified of her. Clegg always strongly denies any romantic interest in her.
