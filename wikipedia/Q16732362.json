Neil Mackay, writing for The Herald, opined that the events had done more to advance anti-Union sentiment than pro-Independence politicians due to the involvement of common people and their rejection of UK immigration laws. On the other hand, in a column for The Scotsman, John McLellan criticized the SNP's response, stating it had raised racial tensions, were hypocritical in light of previous statements and measures against mass gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic and encouraged the violation of the rule of law. In response to COVID-19 concerns, particularly as Pollokshields has been identified as a COVID-19 hotspot and the protests have been compared to Rangers celebrations which have drawn crowds of thousands and resulted in disturbances, Yousaf stated that, while all gatherings must be discouraged, it was not fair to compare the \"thuggish, loutish behaviour\" of the latter with the former."]}]}}
