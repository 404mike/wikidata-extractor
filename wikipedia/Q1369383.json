He was a two-time Grand Prix World Champion. His name appears on the Nazis' \"most wanted\" list drawn up prior to their intended invasion of Britain (published online as \"Hitler's Black Book\" by Forces War Records).Anderson was one of the first riders from Great Britain to make his living racing motorcycles on the European continent. In 1950 he signed with Moto Guzzi and competed in the 250 cc class. He convinced Moto Guzzi to build a 350 cc bike, initially of 320 cc but later a full 350. He raced to the 1953 world championship in the bike's first year of competition. Anderson became the oldest competitor in FIM history to win a Grand Prix race when, he won the 1953 Spanish Grand Prix at the age of 44 years and 273 days. He repeated this feat as 350 cc champion again in 1954. His 350 cc world championship wins were the first by a non-British bike.\nHe retired from racing to become Moto Guzzi's team manager, but quit over a dispute over having a freer hand at running the team. He returned to racing and was offered a ride by the BMW factory. He died in 1956 after being thrown from his bike at a race in Floreffe,  Belgium.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1956", "response": ["* May 6 \u2013 Fergus Anderson, British motorcycle racer (b. 1909)"]}, {"page": "Isle of Man TT", "response": ["| Fergus Anderson, Hugh Anderson, Manliff Barrington, Artie Bell, Geoff Bell, Lowry Burton, Kel Carruthers, Bernard Codd, Charlie Collier, Keith Cornbill, Mark Cox, Steve Cull, Pat Cushnahan, Howard R Davies, Freddie Dixon, Charlie Dodson, Cameron Donald, Iain Duffus, Karl Ellison, Bob Foster, Dick Greasley, Manfred Grunwald, Hermann Hahn, Craig Hallam, Shaun Harris, John Hartle, Pete Hill, Fritz Hillebrand, Mac Hobson, Gary Hocking, John Holden, Josef Huber, Tim Hunt, Bill Ivy, Gary Johnson, Alistair King, Con Law, Eddie Laycock, Ivan Lintin, Bill Lomas, Nick Long, Graeme McGregor, Trevor Nation, Gary Padgett, Steve Plater, Jock Porter, Nick Roche, Cecil Sandford, Dave Saville, Tom Sheard, Edwin Twemlow, Malcolm Uphill, Dave Wells, Eric Williams, Paul Williams, Andrew Winkle, Michael Wynn,", "|  Fergus Anderson", "|  Fergus Anderson", "|  Fergus Anderson"]}, {"page": "Moto Guzzi", "response": ["The Moto Guzzi Grand Prix V8, introduced in 1955, was a 500\u00a0cc racing motorcycle fitted with a V8 engine using dual overhead camshafts (DOHC).

Despite testing the Norton Kneeler for practice for the 1953 Isle of Man TT Races, Amm reverted to the non-streamlined Norton motorcycles due to handling problems with cross-winds on the Mountain Section of the course and also opposition by the TT Race Scrutineers. It proved a good choice as Amm won the 1953 Junior TT Race at an average race speed of 90.52\u00a0mph from Ken Kavanagh in 2nd place and Fergus Anderson in 3rd place.  Another win in the 1953 Senior TT Race for Amm at an average race speed of 93.85\u00a0mph completed a prestigious Junior/Senior TT double win for the works Norton team. Following Amm during the 1953 Senior TT Race, Geoff Duke commented on Amm's distinctive riding style;- \"After I had caught and passed Ray Amm on the Norton, he passed me at Ballugh when I missed a gearchange! Then there was the frightening experience of following him to the end of the lap, Ray could be pretty lurid when he was trying!\"page 69 A Motorcourse History of the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Races 1907-1989 By Nick Harris.  A fall at the 1953 French Grand Prix at Rouen in the 350cc class broke a collar-bone and brought about a premature end to championship ambitions for Amm for the 1953 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.

Also at Montlh\u00e9ry in November 1953, Amm shared a streamlined Norton Sidecar outfit with Eric Oliver to set further speed records.", "The next event after the 1954 Isle of Man TT Races was the Ulster Grand Prix held at the Dundrod Circuit in Northern Ireland. In an event that was much affected by rain, Amm won the 350\u00a0cc Ulster Grand Prix at an average race speed of 83.47\u00a0mph from Jack Brett in 2nd place and Bob McIntyre in 3rd place.  The 500\u00a0cc Ulster Grand Prix was reduced from 27 laps to 15 laps due to heavy rain and again the race was won by Amm at an average race speed of 83.87\u00a0mph, although later these result was excluded from the World Championship by the FIM. A further Grand Prix win in 1954 followed for Amm with another 350\u00a0cc victory at the German Grand Prix held at Solitudering.
