Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy, 2004, pp. 17\u201318. The NP called for British workers to seize the right to work and offered a fairly Strasserite economic policy.M. Walker, The National Front, 1977, p. 194. Nonetheless, the NP failed to last for very long. Due in part to Read's lack of enthusiasm for Strasserism, the main exponents of the idea drifted away."]}, {"page": "National Party (UK, 1976)", "response": ["* David McCalden, a former NF writer who later emigrated to the United States where he became a co-founder of a Holocaust denial organization the Institute for Historical Review.", "| Greenwich || David McCalden || 252 || 1.2"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Holocaust denial", "response": ["List of all pages in category Holocaust denial retrieved by PockBot.PockBot is currently Undergoing Trials.
