Bob and Chris Herbert, the two men who had earlier created the Spice Girls, thought the time was right for a male group. Over 3,000 hopefuls auditioned, including Russell Brand, and they were finally narrowed down to only 14, five of whom had arranged themselves into a group while waiting for their audition. The auditions resulted in a provisional casting of nine members: Richard Breen (now better known as Abz Love), Ritchie Neville, Scott Robinson, Sean Conlon, Jason \"J\" Brown, and stand-by members Peter Cheshire, Paul Taylor, Anthony Baker (rapper) and Ric Hershon. Because his first name was Richard, Breen created the nickname 'Abs' (from his middle name, \"Abidin\") to avoid confusion with Neville (born Richard Neville Dobson). Cheshire and Taylor were later cut when the final five were chosen in May 1997 and Hershon could not attend the final selection.

While the girl is on the sciencity, she watches the faces of each member of the band. The sparks come through, and she gasps when she tries to escape. Several minutes later, she runs down the stairs, enters a different office and discovers Sean's head inside a refrigerator and she screams in terror. When Five are dancing in the hallway, she runs back into the same office and answers the telephone and there's no one calling. The sparks and electricity crashes on the computer and she runs out while screaming. Five talk when she is trapped in the mansion, then Neville says, \"Let's Get J Back\". The members turn invisible and she closes her eyes and screams again. Following that, J reemerges, then goes on to rejoin the rest of the band. The members dance and the Five logo comes up.
