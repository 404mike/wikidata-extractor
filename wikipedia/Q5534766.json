He argues that a litigant would hope that courts would strive to uphold his rights under the convention, accepting a derivation from them only rarely; instead section 3 requires courts to find compatibility with the Convention where possible \u2013 in other words, to strive to find that the Convention does not impact the claimant. Alison L. Young has examined the upper boundaries to courts' powers of interpretation. She puts forward three possible limits: firstly, where the text of a statute is not ambiguous; secondly, where reading in words is inappropriate; and, thirdly, where any interpretation is restricted to cases where it does not involve implied repeal. Young dismisses the first two as incompatible with the legislative history (and, in at least the first case, judicial history) and believes the third to present no rigid limit on courts' powers at all. The decision of Pepper v Hart provides a method for the legislative history of a bill to play a role in its interpretation."]}, {"page": "List of provosts of The Queen's College, Oxford", "response": ["| Geoffrey Marshall"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Marshall", "response": ["Geoffrey Marshall may refer to:", "*Geoffrey Marshall (constitutionalist) (1929\u20132003), British constitutional theorist", "*Sir Geoffrey Marshall (physician) (1887\u20131982), British president of the Royal Society of Medicine", "*Geoffrey Marshall (priest) (born 1948), Anglican priest and former dean of Brecon Cathedral"]}]}}
