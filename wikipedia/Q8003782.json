There is an ancient yew tree (Taxus baccata) reputed to be nearly 2000 years old and legend has it that Knights Templar are buried in the graveyard there, although there is no evidence to substantiate this."]}, {"page": "Blundell's School", "response": ["*Willi Soukop, sculptor"]}, {"page": "Elisabeth Frink", "response": ["Frink studied at the Guildford School of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts) (1946\u20131949), under Willi Soukop, and at the Chelsea School of Art (1949\u20131953). She was part of a postwar group of British sculptors, dubbed the Geometry of Fear school, that included Reg Butler, Bernard Meadows, Kenneth Armitage and Eduardo Paolozzi. Frink's subject matter included men, birds, dogs, horses and religious motifs, but very seldom any female forms. Bird (1952; London, Tate), one of a number of bird sculptures, and her first successful pieces (also Three Heads and the Figurative Tradition) with its alert, menacing stance, characterizes her early work. She created a bookrest in the form of an eagle, for the lectern of the new Coventry Cathedral, as well as a canopy for its Bishop's throne."]}, {"page": "Academy of Fine Arts Vienna", "response": ["* Willi Soukop"]}, {"page": "Brynmor Jones Library", "response": ["The building consists of two main sections, the older Art Deco style entrance and front section, built in the 1950s, which is five floors high (originally three which were later subdivided by mezzanines) and the newer extension, completed in 1970, which consists of eight floors plus a basement. The older section has two exterior bas-relief sculptures by Willi Soukop, one is of an owl, the other shows a human figure representing the light of knowledge and is positioned directly over the main entrance. The new section has views over the Humber with three lifts for student use and a fourth lift for staff.

There are also a large number of open access computers within the library which are connected to the University network."]}, {"page": "Victor Willing", "response": ["He secured a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, serving in Northern Ireland and at Dover.
