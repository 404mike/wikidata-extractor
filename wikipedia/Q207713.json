As a track cyclist he specialises in the madison, points race, and scratch race disciplines; as a road racer he is a sprinter. He is widely considered one of the greatest road sprinters of all time, and in 2021 was called \"the greatest sprinter in the history of the Tour and of cycling\" by Christian Prudhomme, director of the Tour de France.In his first years as an elite track rider, Cavendish won gold in the madison at the 2005 and 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships riding for Great Britain, with Rob Hayles and Bradley Wiggins respectively, and in the scratch race at the 2006 Commonwealth Games riding for Isle of Man. After failing to win a medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics he did not compete on track again until 2015, subsequently winning his third UCI Track Cycling World Championships title with Wiggins in the madison in 2016, and an individual silver medal in the omnium at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nAs a road cyclist, Cavendish turned professional in 2005, and achieved eleven wins in his first professional season. Cavendish has won 34 Tour de France stages, putting him equal first on the all-time list, contributing to a third-highest total of fifty-two Grand Tour stage victories. He won the Men's road race at the 2011 road world championships, becoming the second male British rider to do so after Tom Simpson. Cavendish has also won the points classification in all three of the grand tours: the 2010 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, the 2011, and 2021 Tours de France and the 2013 Giro d'Italia.

He returned to the Tour de France at the 2021 edition, winning stage four, stage six, and stage ten to take his total to 33 stage wins, one off the overall stage victory record. Three days later, on 9 July, he won the stage from N\u00eemes to Carcassonne to equal the record. He also won the points classification ahead of Michael Matthews and Sonny Colbrelli.\nIn the 2011 Queen's Birthday Honours, Cavendish was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) \"for services to British Cycling.\" He also won the 2011 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award with nearly half of the votes going to him out of a field of ten nominations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isle of Man", "response": ["The Isle of Man is represented as a nation in the Commonwealth Games and the Island Games and hosted the IV Commonwealth Youth Games in 2011.
