A high-scoring match, it also provided highest career scores to team-mate Sammy Woods who scored 215, and Sussex's Francis Marlow who scored 155. He scored his final half-century in a county match against Hampshire with a second-innings 55, which helped set up a 183 run victory for Somerset. He played in four matches in 1896, and in eight innings failed to reach 20. His final first-class match was, like his first, against Surrey at The Oval starting on 1 June and, as with the first, Somerset suffered a heavy loss."]}, {"page": "Marlow (surname)", "response": ["*Francis Marlow (1867\u20131952), English cricketer"]}]}}
