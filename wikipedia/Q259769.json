He is mainly remembered as the commander of the British First Army during Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa and the subsequent Tunisian campaign which ended with the capture of almost 250,000 Axis soldiers. An outwardly reserved character, he did not court popularity either with his superiors or with the public. His American superior, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, wrote that he was \"blunt, at times to the point of rudeness\". In consequence he is less well known than many of his contemporaries. According to Richard Mead, however, \"he handled a difficult campaign more competently than his critics suggest, but competence without flair was not good enough for a top commander in 1944\".", "link_mentions": []}}
