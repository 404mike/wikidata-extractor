After a loan spell with Dundee United he moved to Partick Thistle in 2018 and then Queen's Park in 2020 before joining Forfar in 2021.\nSlater has represented Scotland at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dundee F.C.", "response": ["On the opening day of the 2014\u201315 season, Dundee recorded a 1\u20131 draw against Kilmarnock at home, Gary Harkins put Dundee ahead from the spot after Kilmarnock conceded a penalty, with Craig Slater equalising for the visitors from a well struck free-kick on the edge of the Dundee area. Dundee won their first game of the 2014\u201315 season on 23 August with a 1\u20130 win over St Mirren away from home, a 79th-minute goal from Peter MacDonald securing the win, making them unbeaten in their first four league games of the season.

He did not take charge of Colchester until after the final game of the 2015\u201316 season, in which his assistant Steve Ball was named caretaker. The club signed a number of players in preparation for the 2016\u201317 season, including defenders Luke Prosser (who he appointed as captain) and Lewis Kinsella; midfielders Brennan Dickenson, Craig Slater and Doug Loft; and forwards Courtney Senior, Kurtis Guthrie, and Denny Johnstone.

He earned his first win on 13 August as his side defeated Cambridge United 2\u20130 at the Colchester Community Stadium. After three wins and one draw in Colchester's opening five league fixtures, McGreal was nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for August. After an eleven-game winless run, McGreal's side went undefeated in December, earning ten points from a possible twelve which propelled Colchester up the League Two table away from the relegation zone. In turn, McGreal was shortlisted for the League Two Manager of the Month award for December. He won the award on 6 January 2017, becoming the first Colchester manager to win the award since Paul Lambert in January 2009. Later that month he signed Sean Murray on a free transfer from Swindon Town. The \"U's\" finished the season eighth in the table, one place and one point behind Blackpool in the play-offs, who would go on to achieve promotion.

Early season promise faded in late September with a winless run that stretched to the end of November. A turn in fortunes saw the U's win seven out of eight league games through December into January, earning John McGreal the December League Two Manager of the Month award.
