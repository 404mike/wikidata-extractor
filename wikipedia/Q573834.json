The peninsula is bounded to the north by Sevastopol Harbour, at the head of which the River Chernaya flows from the south-east. The eastern boundary is formed by a long escarpment, the Sapoun\u00e9 Heights, averaging 600 feet high, and pierced by two passes only: the metalled Worontsov road, and, at the southern end of the heights, the Col, through which ran a steeper and more difficult road leading from the west end of Sevastopol to Balaclava.Blake: The Crimean War, 68 Sevastopol itself was divided in two by the Dockyard Creek. Two of Canrobert's four divisions, supervised by General Forey, were allotted the western siege operations around the city, from the Black Sea to the Dockyard Creek; the other two divisions, under General Bosquet, would act as a covering force along the Sapoun\u00e9 Heights.The Sapoun\u00e9 Heights along with the Vorontsov Road can be seen on the map XXIX of Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History (Picador Publishing: New York, 2010). To Bosquet's north lay the camp of the British 1st Division, and beyond this De Lacy Evans' 2nd Division guarding the extreme right of the Allied line with the Inkerman Heights to its front and the Chernaya Valley to its right.Fletcher & Ishchenko: The Crimean War: A Clash of Empires, 137"]}, {"page": "Rye (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Philip PuseyPusey was originally declared elected, but by an order of the House of Commons on 17 May 1830 his name was erased from the return and that of De Lacy Evans was substituted", "| De Lacy Evans", "| De Lacy Evans", "* 15 votes for De Lacy Evans were rejected but, after petition, he was declared elected on 17 May 1830 and Pusey's election was declared void."]}, {"page": "Edward De Lacy Evans", "response": ["Edward De Lacy Evans (born Ellen Tremayne or Tremaye, 1830? \u2013 25 August 1901) was a servant, blacksmith and gold miner, who immigrated from Ireland to Australia in 1856, and made international news in 1879 when it was revealed he was born a woman.", "Mystery surrounds Evans' early life and his choice of name. He told miners he worked with in Australia that he was born in France, had stolen \u00a3500 as a boy and fled to Waterford,  where he acquired his Irish accent. A woman living near Corop, who claimed to be a former Kilkenny neighbour, said he was the well-born 'Ellen Lacy' who had an illegitimate child, fled to America, but returned in the early 1850s as 'Mrs De Lacy Evans' to ride her horse through a gathering called by John Ponsonby, 5th Earl of Bessborough before being 'dragged off her pony' and forced to 'clear out'. Evans' third wife, Julia Marquand, said the name was a family one and his uncle was the well known British General George de Lacy Evans.", "For most of the voyage to Australia, Evans wore the same outfit of 'a green merino dress and sealskin coat reaching almost to her ankles' with men's shirt and trousers, and was said to have a traveling trunk full of male attire, stamped with the name 'Edward De Lacy Evans'. This, and the fact he appeared to have 'formed sexual attachments' with some of the women he shared a cabin with, led to on-board speculation he was a man impersonating a woman. One of these women was later identified as Rose Kelly who was said to have been taken ill and, as a result, departed at Rio de Janeiro en route, while another was said to have been a Mary Montague. Further speculation, from among his fellow passengers, was that the 'real' Edward De Lacy Evans had enticed 'Ellen Tremayne' to take passage with him on the ship by sending his trunk ahead but he then abandoned 'her'. A later theory, not publicly mentioned during the voyage or late 19th century newspaper reports, was that the clothes belonged to Evans, and he had been wearing them prior to his immigration, but decided to make the long sea voyage \u2013 either through fear of disclosure among men, or preferring the company of women \u2013 in a female guise.", "thumb|Bendigo Court House where Edward De Lacy Evans was sentenced to the 'Lunatic Ward' of the hospital in July 1879.", "thumb|left|alt=Image of Kew Asylum| Kew Asylum in the 19th century where Edward De Lacy Evans was sent", "\"One of the most unparalleled impostures has been brought to light during the past few days, which it has ever been the province of the press of these colonies to chronicle, and we might even add is unprecedented in the annals of the whole world.
