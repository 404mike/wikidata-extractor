Among the most outstanding Catalan neoclassical artists represented here are the painter Josep Bernat Flaugier and the sculptor Dami\u00e0 Campeny. In terms of Romanticism, particular mention should be made of Nazarene painters such as Claudi Lorenzale, who focussed on the portrait most notably, and Llu\u00eds Rigalt, a precursor of the Catalan landscape tradition, which was continued (now entering the Realist period) by Ramon Mart\u00ed Alsina, who introduced Courbet's ideas in Catalonia, and Joaquim Vayreda, founder of the Olot School, among others. Special mention should also be made of Mari\u00e0 Fortuny, Catalonia's finest 19th-century painter. Fortuny's genre painting won him international acclaim, although towards the end of his short life he became interested in pictorial innovation, as can be seen in his last works. Also represented here are several painters who worked in the style of anecdotal realism, including Rom\u00e0 Ribera and Francesc Masriera, and the Luminists of the Sitges School, disciples of Fortuny. Turning now to sculpture, the Vallmitjana brothers are the most outstanding exponents of the realist tradition. Finally, the section devoted to the 19th century also includes examples from early photographic art, featuring works by A. A. Disd\u00e9ri, Jean Laurent, Le Jeune and Charles Clifford, among others, featuring images of different places from all over Spanish territory."]}, {"page": "British Cemetery in Madrid", "response": ["Notable burials include Alice Bache Gould, Charles Clifford, Irakli Bagration of Mukhrani, Walter Shirlaw and Walter Starkie."]}, {"page": "Charles Clifford", "response": ["Charles Clifford may refer to:", "* Sir Charles Clifford, 1st Baronet (1813\u20131893), first Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives", "* Charles Clifford (photographer) (1820\u20131863), photographer", "* Sir Charles Clifford, 4th Baronet (1821\u20131895), Member of Parliament (MP) for the Isle of Wight 1857\u20131865, Newport 1870\u20131885", "* Charles Clifford, pseudonym of William Henry Ireland (1775\u20131835) English literary forger", "* Charles Clifford (locomotive engineer) (died 1927), locomotive superintendent of the Great Northern Railway of Ireland."]}, {"page": "Leaning Tower of Zaragoza", "response": ["In the 19th century the tower was heavily reproduced by painters and photographers, among them Charles Clifford, on October 1860, and J.
