For the position that Thessalian Cyrene does not presuppose the city of the same name, cf. . Others have argued that the citation is also vague regarding just which Hesiodic poem included the Cyrene-Ehoie, the Catalogue or the Megalai Ehoiai: the latter might have included a narrative similar to Pindar's, with the former presenting a different version of the myth, if indeed the Catalogue treated Cyrene at all.; cf. . The complete removal of Cyrene would not, however, be easily accommodated by related evidence\u2014it would presumably also involve transferring two fragments concerning Aristaeus which have traditionally been attributed to the Catalogue, and his son Actaeon certainly appeared in the poem.The Aristaeus fragments are 215 and 216, neither of which are explicitly assigned to the Catalogue by the testimonia; cf.  who notes that Cyrene is the only known mother of Aristaeus.", "Richard Janko's survey of epic language, on the other hand, suggests that the Catalogue is very early, nearly contemporary with Hesiod's Theogony,. and Janko sees no reason why the Catalogue \"should not be by the same poet as the Theogony,\" who \"calls himself Hesiod.\". But a different critical strain, one which views the transmitted Homeric and Hesiodic poems as ultimate products of rhapsodic recomposition within an oral tradition, would hold that from an initial Hesiodic nucleus the Catalogue arrived at its final form well after period to which Hesiod has been assigned.. Such a scenario could account for perceived anachronisms in the mythological content and in the linguistic character of the poem,, cf. . but would sidestep the issue of the relation between the Catalogue as it has been transmitted and the broader corpus of early Greek epic.."]}, {"page": "William of Baskerville", "response": ["* \"Books are not made to be believed, but to be subjected to inquiry.\" (Used as an epigram by Richard Janko in his reconstruction of Aristotle's Poetics II, Aristotle on Comedy.)"]}, {"page": "Philodemus", "response": ["Philodemus: On Poems.

At the other extreme, scholars such as Gregory Nagy see \"Homer\" as a continually evolving tradition, which grew much more stable as the tradition progressed, but which did not fully cease to continue changing and evolving until as late as the middle of the second century BC. Martin Litchfield West has argued that the Iliad echoes the poetry of Hesiod, and that it must have been composed around 660-650 BC at the earliest, with the Odyssey up to a generation later. He also interprets passages in the Iliad as showing knowledge of historical events that occurred in the ancient Near East during the middle of the seventh century BC, including the destruction of Babylon by Sennacherib in 689 BC and the Sack of Thebes by Ashurbanipal in 663/4 BC."]}, {"page": "Homeric scholarship", "response": ["The dating of the Homeric epics continues to be a controversial topic. The most influential work in this area in the last few decades is that of Richard Janko, whose 1982 study Homer, Hesiod and the Hymns uses statistics based on a range of dialectal pointers to argue that the text of both epics became fixed in the latter half of the 8th century, though he has since argued for an even earlier date.See e.g. R. Janko 1996, \"The performance of Homeric epic\", Didaskalia 3.3. There is no shortage of alternative datings, however, based on other kinds of evidence (literary, philological, archaeological, and artistic), ranging from the 9th century to as late as 550 BCE (Nagy suggests in a 1992 paper that the text's \"formative\" period lasted until 550). At present most Homeric scholars opt for the late 8th or early 7th century, and a date of 730 BCE is often quoted for the Iliad.Martin L. West in his 2010 commentary on the Iliad (and in earlier scholarly writings) argues for a dating of the poem in the period 680-650 BC, based in part on apparent references to works of other poems, e.g. Hesiod and Tyrtaeus, and in part on artistic and other comparative evidence."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Kirk", "response": ["Much of his retirement was taken up by work on a large-scale commentary on Homer's Iliad.

Cramer, poring through the collection of Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin, was struck by the content, believing it to be the work of a commentator on Aristotle's theory of comedy, and published it in 1839. This belief was soon derided, but it has gained force in the 20th century; Richard Janko has argued that it is the notes or sketches of the lost second section of the Poetics.
