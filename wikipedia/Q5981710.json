The only Cabinet member to endorse Heseltine for the second ballot was the Welsh Secretary, David Hunt, who had not been party to the agreement as he had been away in Tokyo. Four junior ministers openly backed Heseltine: the Welsh Office ministers Wyn Roberts and Ian Grist, and David Trippier and David Leigh. Heseltine was also endorsed by a number of senior ex-ministers including: Sir Geoffrey Howe, Nigel Lawson, Lord Carrington (who as a peer had no vote), Peter Walker, David Howell, Ian Gilmour, Norman Fowler, Geoffrey Rippon, Jim Prior, Norman St John-Stevas and Paul Channon, but he had less support among younger MPs amongst whom he had done little to canvass support. Heseltine's campaign chairman Michael Mates was away for five days in the Middle East with the Defence Select Committee, of which he was chairman, so Heseltine's campaign did not have the cohesion of Major's, which was run by Norman Lamont. Heseltine's supporters, besides being older than those of the other candidates, tended to be pro-Europeans with a few populist backbenchers like David Evans, Tony Marlow and John Wilkinson."]}, {"page": "Ian", "response": ["*Ian Grist (1938\u20132002), British politician"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Ian Grist"]}, {"page": "Third Thatcher ministry", "response": ["|Under-Secretary of State for Wales||Ian Grist||15 June 1987 \u2013 28 November 1990||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Grist (surname)", "response": ["*Ian Grist (1938\u20132002), British Conservative politician"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2002", "response": ["*Ian Grist, 63, British Conservative politician, stroke."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 2000s", "response": ["|Ian Grist"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales", "response": ["*1987\u20131990 Ian Grist"]}, {"page": "Module talk:Political party", "response": [":Your changes of election templates from \"Labour Party (UK)\" to \"Welsh Labour\", \"Conservative Party (UK)\" to \"Welsh Conservatives\" etc etc are completely unnecessary. UK elections are fought on a UK-wide basis. The idea that people like Ian Grist or James Callaghan (or even people who lost seats in Wales, like David Tredinnick or Bryan Davies) should be thought of as \"Welsh Conservative\" or \"Welsh Labour\" rather than UK-wide politicians is plain wrong. You seem to have unilaterally changed about 10 Welsh constituency pages like this (nowhere near all of them), without even creating the \"Welsh Liberal Party\" template. They really should all be changed back to the UK-wide template.88.106.240.100 (talk) 12:03, 9 January 2022 (UTC)"]}]}}
