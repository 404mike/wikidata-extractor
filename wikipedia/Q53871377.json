Lib\u00e9ration published an open letter in support of the migrants on 20 October 2015, signed by 800 film-makers and intellectuals. Jaz O'Hara visited with her boyfriend during summer 2015 and decided to collect donations after writing a Facebook post which was shared 60,000 times in a few days. They set up a group called CalAid and collected clothing donations in London. They received hundreds of tents from Reading and Leeds Festivals and took the donations to Calais in a fleet of 40 vans. TV presenter Dawn O'Porter and Radio X presenter Lliana Bird, along with mutual friend Josie Naughton, used their social media capital to organise a donation and fund-raising Twitter campaign in August 2015, using the hashtag #HelpCalais. For the first five weeks, about 7,000 items were purchased a day from the group's Amazon wish list and within weeks they had raised \u00a350,000. The scale of the response drew the women into further logistical and distribution organisation, out of which the charity Help Refugees was formed."]}]}}
