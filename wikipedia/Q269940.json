In January 1910 the School Hostel opened in rented premises under the care of a Mrs Smylie to allow students with long journeys between home and school to stay in Chelmsford during the week.  The school remained open throughout World War I, with forms being assigned \"shelter\" in a place away from windows or an outer wall. It also took in refugee students from Belgium and educated them. In June 1916 Winifred Picking became the School's first University success when she gained a First Class degree in the Natural Science Tripos at Girton College, Cambridge. The school's motto \"Vitai lampada ferimus\" or \" We carry the torch of life\" was chosen in 1923, which is part of the school crest.  In 1936 the School Hostel shut down due to lack of viability, due to improved transport around Chelmsford.  A year later, in 1937, the electric bell system was first installed. It was removed in 1999.  The school remained open during World War II, though this time the school was damaged several times in air raids. Fortunately the worst raid, when nearly every window in the school was broken, occurred during a school holiday. Maintaining examination conditions during air raids was also a problem: eventually exam candidates were given their own separate shelter.  Extensive building work was initiated in the 1950s and continued throughout the 1960s \u2013 in that time, the current caretaker's house, swimming pool, hall, canteen, art rooms, and library were built. In February 1962, HRH Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother arrived on the School grounds by helicopter to be guest of honour at the Senior Speech Day, which was held at Chelmsford Cathedral. The introduction of Technology, particularly IT, began in the 1980s.  In 1992, CCHS became a Grant Maintained school with control over its own funds, and a School Bursar was employed. Margaret Thatcher, along with the local MP Simon Burns, paid a brief visit to the school on 30 March 1992. Building work continued with the development of the new school Astroturf pitch in 2004, the extension of the sixth form common room in 2005, and new music centre in 2007, which has been built in the shape of an orchestra, including a fully equipped recording studio. The building was opened in January 2008 by Dame Evelyn Glennie.  In 2007 the School celebrated its Centenary, with HRH Sophie, Countess of Wessex.  The school converted to academy status on 1 January 2011. In 2013 the new Languages Centre was completed, which has brought language learning into the 21st century.  In 2015 and in 2020 the governors of the School voted unanimously to expand CCHS by 30 each time, increasing the intake to 180, the decision was taken in response to the ever-increasing demand for places at the School and a desire to offer the opportunity to be educated in a grammar school to even more girls."]}, {"page": "Burns (surname)", "response": ["*Simon Burns (born 1952), British politician"]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people in British public life", "response": ["| Simon Burns"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Simon Burns; MP for Chelmsford (1987\u20131997; 2010\u20132017) and West Chelmsford (1997\u20132010)"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Treasury", "response": ["**Simon Burns", "**Simon Burns", "**Simon Burns"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Peg Alexander, Simon Burns, Clarissa Dickson-Wright, Alun Michael"]}, {"page": "Tum Mile", "response": ["The movie is in clips of Past and Present.
