His award-winning films include portraits of Cary Grant, John Adams (composer), Elvis Costello, Boy George, Ravi Shankar, Rod Stewart, Bill Viola, Iannis Xenakis, pianists Alfred Brendel and Leon Fleisher, Derek Jarman, Balthus, Tricky, Robert Wyatt and American theatre and opera director Peter Sellars.\nA pioneer of the \"rockumentary\", Kidel was also the first rock critic of the New Statesman and contributed pieces on rock, soul, and world music, to The Observer, The Sunday Times, and The Guardian.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London Calling", "response": ["London Calling is regarded by music critic Mark Kidel as the first post-punk double album, as it exhibits a broader range of musical styles than the Clash's previous records. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the album appropriated the \"punk aesthetic into rock & roll mythology and roots music\", while incorporating a wider range of styles such as punk, reggae, rockabilly, ska, New Orleans R&B, pop, lounge jazz, and hard rock. \"Brand New Cadillac\", the album's second track, was written and originally recorded by Vince Taylor and was cited by the Clash as \"one of the first British rock'n'roll records\". The fifth song, \"Rudie Can't Fail\" features a horn section and mixes elements of pop, soul, and reggae music together."]}, {"page": "Bad News (band)", "response": ["Bad News made their television debut during 1983, in the first series of The Comic Strip Presents... (written by Edmondson, and produced by Michael White/Comic Strip Productions). The episode, \"Bad News Tour\", took the form of a satirical fly-on-the-wall rockumentary, in which the incompetent band is followed travelling to a gig in Grantham, by an almost equally inept documentary film crew: It seemed to take much inspiration from Mark Kidel's 1976 BBC documentary So You Wanna Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star? that followed the Kursaal Flyers around Scotland and northeast England. In the episode, Bad News is a band just starting out; they have no recording contract, no management, no crew, and have apparently only been together for a short while. The 30-minute documentary follows them on their \"tour\" (apparently only one gig), which is an unqualified disaster ... only four people show up.  Along the way, there is much inter-group squabbling as Bad News are profiled by \"rock journalist extraordinaire\" Sally Freidman (Jennifer Saunders), and pick up a schoolgirl groupie named Tracy (Dawn French).  The episode was filmed in autumn 1982 and was coincidentally in production at the same time as the similar mock-documentary This Is Spinal Tap, which was released in 1984 to a much wider audience."]}, {"page": "World of Music, Arts and Dance", "response": ["WOMAD was founded in 1980 by English rock musician Peter Gabriel, with Thomas Brooman, Bob Hooton, Mark Kidel, Stephen Pritchard, Martin Elbourne and Jonathan Arthur.Bright, Spencer: Peter Gabriel, an authorized biography (p. 180) , Pan 1999.Derek Beres, review of \"Between Two Worlds\", 2006.
