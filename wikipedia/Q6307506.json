The publication also noted undetailed graphics and \"ear-bashing tunes\". The magazine's Julian Rignall compared Maniac Mansion to the title Shadowgate, but he preferred the former's controls and lack of \"death-without-warning situations\". Writers for Germany's Video Games referred to the NES version as a \"classic\". Co-reviewer Heinrich Lenhardt stated that Maniac Mansion was unlike any other NES adventure game, and that it was no less enjoyable than its home computer releases. Co-reviewer Winnie Forster found it to be \"one of the most original representatives of the [adventure game] genre\". In retrospective features, Edge magazine called the NES version \"somewhat neutered\" and GamesTM referred to it as \"infamous\" and \"heavily censored\"."]}, {"page": "Super Mario Bros. 3", "response": ["The Japanese publication Famitsu gave it a 35 out of 40. Julian Rignall of Mean Machines referred to Super Mario Bros. 3 as the \"finest video game\" he had ever played, citing its addictiveness, depth, and challenge. A second Mean Machines reviewer, Matt Regan, anticipated the game would be a bestseller in the United Kingdom, and echoed Rignall's praise, calling it a \"truly brilliant game\". Regan further stated that the game offered elements which tested the player's \"brains and reflexes\", and that though the graphics were simple, they were \"incredibly varied\". In a preview of the game, Nintendo Power gave it high marks in graphics, audio, challenge, gameplay, and enjoyability. The items hidden in the game's levels, such as the warp whistles, were well-received: Rignall regarded them as part of the game's addictiveness, and Sheff stated that finding them provided a sense of satisfaction."]}, {"page": "Street Fighter II", "response": ["The arcade game was well received by English-language critics upon release. In March 1991, RePlay magazine said \"the graphics and sounds are tops\" while praising the \"solid\" gameplay, and it was considered the top game at the American Coin Machine Exposition (ACME) that month. In May 1991, Julian Rignall of Computer and Video Games gave it ratings of 94% for graphics, 93% for sound, 95% for playability, and 92% for lastability, with a 93% score overall. He criticized the original Street Fighter for being a \"run-of-the-mill beat 'em up with little in the way of thrills and spills\" but praised the sequel for being \"absolutely packed with new ideas\" and special moves. He noted the \"six buttons combining with 8 joystick directions to provide more moves than I've ever seen in a beat 'em up\" and praised the \"massive, beautifully drawn and animated sprites, tons of speech and the most exciting, action-packed head-to-head conflict yet seen in an arcade game,\" concluding that it is \"one of the best fighting games yet seen in the arcades\" and a \"brilliant\" coin-op. In the June 1991 issue of Sinclair User, John Cook gave the arcade game an \"addict factor\" of 84%. He praised the gameplay and the \"excellent\" animation and sound effects, but criticized the controls, stating players \"might find the control system a bit daunting at first [with] a joystick plus six (count 'em!) fire buttons [but] it's not that bad really\". He concluded \"this is bound to appeal to you if you like the beat 'em up style of game.\" Jeff Davy of Your Commodore praised the game for its large sprites, character animation, varied opponents, character moves, and two-player mode.

Retro Gamer's Mike Bevan gave positive remarks to the presentation but lamented the lack of a console release. Computer and Video Gamess Julian Rignall scored the game with an overall 80% rating.

The game was featured in the magazine's September\u2013October 1990 issue, which featured a walkthrough of the game's first three levels. It was also featured in UK-based magazine Mean Machines, where it received high praise from editors Matt Regan and Julian Rignall. Regan praised the game's 3D environment, fun gameplay, and level of humor, as noted by the odd objects such as toilet seats. Rignall called the game's graphics \"stunning, with beautifully drawn scrolling forced perspective 3D backdrops and some great sprites\"; he also lauded the game's playability and simple controls, challenging difficulty, and overall fun factor.

He also criticized the fact that players cannot hit enemies while in mid-air. However, he noted the game's good gameplay. Julian Rignall also said that the game was fun, but it was not spectacular. However, just as Regan noted, Rignall said that the game did not offer anything special like with better titles such as Mega Man\u00a02 or Super Mario Bros.\u00a02.

The Lessers of Dragon magazine were equally impressed with the gameplay, praising Alisia Dragoon for its \"solid arcade action\" that satisfied their \"need for fast reflexes\". Mean Machiness Julian Rignall praised the game for its pet monsters design, calling the management of the pets in the game an encouragement toward tactics. His fellow reviewer, Richard Leadbetter, wrote the game was visually attractive with \"beautiful sprites\" and \"amazing backdrops\". He found the gameplay challenging, being forced to conserve energy as the game \"[threw] everything but the kitchen sink at [him]\". Rignall agreed with Leadbetter on the game's difficulty, which along with the secret rooms and power-ups to be discovered made Alisia Dragoon an excellent action platform game that had long-lasting appeal.

However, the review said \"the fairly repetitive nature of the game, and the large amount of physical effort needed to play it, will prevent Street Fighter from being much more than a novel experiment in coin-op technology\" but that only \"time will tell\".

Dragons three reviewers gave the title a perfect rating in 1990, referring it as a greatly expanded version of Gauntlet.
