She met and fell in love with a Polish RAF pilot, and had a child, Peter, but the airman was killed in action. She then worked for the potter Lucie Rie, who was also a refugee from Vienna. After the war, she met and married the painter Peter Kinley, who was her second cousin.", "Kinley was introduced to the London art scene by working on the bookstall at the Tate Gallery in 1953 selling postcards. She worked in art dealing, first with Victor Waddington and then at the Grosvenor Gallery, and when she separated from Peter Kinley (died 1988) she began to deal on her own account from her home, a flat in Hammersmith. She acted for Prunella Clough, Keith Vaughan, Leon Kossoff and Frank Auerbach, and as an adviser to museums and galleries.", "In 1977, Kinley met Victor Musgrave, the poet, art dealer and curator who claimed to be the first London art dealer not to wear a tie, and was to become her life partner. They did not marry, her marriage to Peter Kinley did not end until 1980. Victor had been married to the portrait photographer Ida Kar until her death in 1974 and had already been dealing in outsider art for a decade by the time he met Monika. Victor and Monika continued to promote Kar's work, despite the separation.\"Monika Kinley; Collector and curator whose championing of 'outsider art' took her around the world in search of unusual pieces\" in The Times, 29 April 2014. Nexis online edition. Retrieved 6 May 2014. After meeting Victor, outsider art became the principal focus of Monika's dealing, curating and collecting. Together they put on exhibitions, raised funding and started their own collection."]}, {"page": "Kinley, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Kinley"]}, {"page": "Daniel Sturgis", "response": ["He belongs rather to all those artists who try to swim between high art and the popular, between art history and the present: Carl Ostendarp, Jonathan Lasker, David Reed, Mary Heilmann. Within Britain he feels closest to those eclectic figures who flatten things out: Peter Kinley, Patrick Caulfield. But the position he is in today, between art and design, between visual overload and reflection seems a crucial one.Tony Godfrey, Daniel Sturgis Equal Minds (London:Westbook Gallery, 2007).   "]}]}}
