He spoke out the situation on the club's financial problems on two separate occasions.

He missed six matches in November and December because of a torn hamstring, and was otherwise ever-present in league competition. He was used primarily at right back, but switched to the left when Jonathan Grounds was injured to accommodate the right-footed youngster Wes Harding. His second season ran similarly to his first.
