She was head of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from 1948 until 1982.\nThough as a child she was not enthusiastic about Gilbert and Sullivan, after her father's death in 1948 Bridget D'Oyly Carte inherited all her family's business interests, including the opera company, which performed year-round and controlled the copyrights to the joint works of W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. She had begun to assist her father in managing the Savoy Hotel in 1933, also undertaking child welfare work.\nCarte engaged Frederic Lloyd as general manager of the opera company in 1951 and took steps to keep the Savoy operas fresh, with new productions and redesigned costumes and scenery. After the copyrights to the Gilbert and Sullivan works expired in 1961, she transferred the company to a charitable trust, which she headed. In the 1970s, the company experienced mounting losses. These, together with the refusal of the Arts Council to provide a grant, forced the closure of the company in 1982, although it re-formed after Carte's death and mounted productions up to 2003 and occasionally thereafter.\nIn 1972 Carte founded the D'Oyly Carte Charitable Trust to support charitable causes in the fields of the arts, medical welfare and the environment.

Trial by Jury was given four times, as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer, Pinafore and Pirates and as an afterpiece following The Grand Duke. Before the first of the four performances of Trial, a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Richard D'Oyly Carte, Sandford as Gilbert and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial by Jury in 1875; afterwards, the prime minister, Harold Wilson, and Bridget D'Oyly Carte each gave a short speech.Forbes, Elizabeth.
