He did important work on the anatomy of the liver, and he wrote an early pediatric text on rickets.  An experiment he performed helped debunk the balloonist theory of muscle contraction by showing that when a muscle contracted under water, the water level did not rise, and thus no air or fluid could be entering the muscle.\nGlisson was born in Bristol and was educated in Rampisham, Dorset, and at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge. Glisson is a well-known medical eponym; he was for forty years Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge. He died in London.  The Glisson family can be traced to present-day Somerset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rickets", "response": ["Greek physician Soranus of Ephesus, one of the chief representatives of the Methodic school of medicine who practiced in Alexandria and subsequently in Rome, reported deformation of the bones in infants as early as the first and second centuries AD. Rickets was not defined as a specific medical condition until 1645, when an English physician Daniel Whistler gave the earliest known description of the disease. In 1650 a treatise on rickets was published by Francis Glisson, a physician at Caius College, Cambridge, who said it had first appeared about 30 years previously in the counties of Dorset and Somerset. In 1857, John Snow suggested rickets, then widespread in Britain, was being caused by the adulteration of bakers' bread with alum. German pediatrician Kurt Huldschinsky successfully demonstrated in the winter of 1918\u20131919 how rickets could be treated with ultraviolet lamps. The role of diet in the development of rickets was determined by Edward Mellanby between 1918 and 1920. In 1923, American physician Harry Steenbock demonstrated that irradiation by ultraviolet light increased the vitamin D content of foods and other organic materials. Steenbock's irradiation technique was used for foodstuffs, but most memorably for milk. By 1945, rickets had all but been eliminated in the United States."]}, {"page": "John Wilkins", "response": ["Wilkins was one of the group of savants, interested in experimental philosophy, who gathered round Charles Scarburgh, the royalist physician who arrived in London in summer 1646 after the fall of Oxford to the parliamentarian forces.

However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his Theoria Generationis (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a vis essentialis (an organizing, formative force), stating \"All believers in epigenesis are vitalists.\" Carl Reichenbach (1788\u20131869) later developed the theory of Odic force, a form of life-energy that permeates living things."]}, {"page": "1677 in literature", "response": ["*October 14 \u2013 Francis Glisson, English medical writer and physician (born 1597)"]}, {"page": "Library of Sir Thomas Browne", "response": ["*Francis Glisson, De ventriculo & Intestinis, London 1677"]}, {"page": "1650 in science", "response": ["* English physician Francis Glisson publishes the first comprehensive pediatric text on rickets, De rachitide sive morbo puerili, qui vulg\u00f2 The rickets dicitur, the result of collaborative research by members of the Royal College of Physicians.
