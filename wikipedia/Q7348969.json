Much of his cricket was played when he held the rank of Major, but he eventually became a Brigadier-General.  \"Of all the people in the history of the game,\" wrote Leo Cooper in an introduction to A.

A contemporary report from The Argus on 3 April 1902, however, has his last words as \"Take this thing (the blindfold) off\", and on its removal, \"Be sure and make a good job of it!\". Witton wrote that he was by then at Pretoria railway station and heard the volley of shots that killed his comrades. However, Robert Poore, who attended the execution, wrote in his diary that he put Witton and Lieutenant Picton on the train that left at 05:30 hours. Thus, Witton would have been several miles on the way to Cape Town when the execution occurred.", "More recently, a diary written by Robert Poore, the Provost Marshall at the time, was unearthed with a record for 7 October 1901.

I don't like that at all. It seems to me that it would be seriously misleading, and it would be even worse for similar cases where the person hadn't played international cricket so that there wasn't another category to give a clue. Nationality is surely more important than country of birth. Just because Ted Dexter's parents happened to be abroad when he was born doesn't make him any less British. Incidentally, one fascinating case is Robert Poore, born in Ireland when it was still part of Britain and I suspect one of the \"Anglo-Irish\", who served in the British army, and who when stationed in South Africa played in Tests for that country against England.
