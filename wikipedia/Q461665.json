The British government's Home Office, under the supervision of James Lester (Ben Miller) and Claudia Brown (Lucy Brown), becomes involved after a Gorgonopsid travels through one such anomaly and wreaks havoc in the Forest of Dean. Professor Cutter's wife, Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey), presumed dead for eight years, was revealed to have been travelling in time through the anomalies. Cutter was unable to convince her to help as she had changed much from the woman he had once known, and he began to fall in love with Claudia. Meanwhile, Abby began to take care of a Coelurosauravus she named Rex after he was left behind in the present, and was attracted to Stephen, who didn't completely reciprocate her feelings, despite Connor's romantic pursuit of her. The final episode of the first series sees the team deal with the consequences of an anomaly to the future opening in the Permian, allowing Predators from the future to access the past, and then follow Helen Cutter to the present. After the team secure the offspring of the Future Predator, killing an adult in the process, Cutter and Helen lead a group of soldiers into the Permian to secure the future anomaly and the time-line. However, an attack by a second adult Future Predator left Cutter and Helen as the only survivors. This disaster was predicted by Cutter seconds before it happened, as he realised that the camp he and the now dead Captain Ryan discovered on their first visit was in fact the remains of this expedition. Upon returning Cutter discovered Stephen had once had an affair with Helen before she had disappeared, and then learned that Claudia Brown no longer exists as the time-line had changed very slightly after their trip, and only he and Helen were aware of it.", "The full circumstances behind the disappearance of Claudia Brown are never explained, with Cutter only knowing that it was the result of the visit to the Permian changing something in the present. In Claudia's place an assertive and quite different PR agent named Jenny Lewis (also played by Lucy Brown) joined the team in the Anomaly Research Centre or ARC, a building in the new time-line that deals with researching the anomalies. Having fallen for Claudia, a distraught Cutter was forced to start again with her look alike while Connor gained a girlfriend, Caroline Steel (Naomi Bentley), a woman with a hidden agenda, whom Abby despised. Abby and Connor are drawn closer by an encounter with Mer Creatures (seal-like creatures from the future). As Stephen and Cutter tried to repair their friendship, Helen also returned and began rekindling her friendship with Stephen, and eventually their affair. Taking Claudia's previous position was a man named Oliver Leek (Karl Theobald), who secretly worked with Helen to use the anomalies to gain political power by gathering some of the creatures the team had encountered, and also controlling the future predators. After Connor breaks up with Caroline by text message, she steals Rex for Leek. The team were also faced with a mysterious cleaner (Tim Faraday) whom they first encountered at a shopping mall and who worked against the team before he was killed in the Silurian by a Silurian Scorpion. The final conflict of the series resulted in the deaths of Stephen, who died to save the lives of the rest of the team, and Leek, who was torn apart when he lost control of his creatures.", "* Lucy Brown as Claudia Brown/Jenny Lewis (series 1\u20133, guest in series 4)"]}, {"page": "Sayaka Kobayashi", "response": ["*Primeval (DVD edition) (Claudia Brown/Jennifer Lewis (Lucy Brown))"]}, {"page": "Come Back, Africa", "response": ["*Music: Lucy Brown"]}, {"page": "Episode 1 (Primeval season 1)", "response": ["* Lucy Brown - Claudia Brown"]}, {"page": "Episode 6 (Primeval season 1)", "response": ["Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall) is practicing putting in his office using a thin animal femur a little over 3 feet long as a club.

She later develops feelings for Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall).", "Before her disappearance, Helen had an affair with her student, a young man named Stephen Hart (James Murray), Nick Cutter's (Douglas Henshall) best friend and right-hand man. After being chased through an anomaly eight years before the main events of the series were put into motion, she used her disappearance to lead her estranged husband, Cutter to believe she was dead. She possesses knowledge of what lies on the other sides of each anomaly, but chooses not to divulge key information, however for some reason she chooses to save the life of Claudia Brown when her life is threatened by an attack by piranha-like Anurognathus. Helen refusing to divulge information  into why the anomalies form, to the Home Office, places her as  the focus of attention in series 1's storyline. Cutter, her estranged husband, also had a personal wish for her to return, and for her to stop escaping. She also seemed to disapprove of her husband's budding relationship with Claudia Brown (Lucy Brown) and it is hinted she may have had a hand in Claudia's disappearance.", "At the end of episode 2.4, Helen is shown directing the team that is spying on the ARC members. During episode 2.5, Helen visits Stephen again and imparts some information about the group spying on the ARC members, but states it in a way to make it sound like Cutter is involved and Lester is in charge. In episode 2.6 Helen starts showing her feelings about Stephen and they share a passionate kiss and is revealed to be working with Oliver Leek (Karl Theobald) in attempting to experiment on the anomalies to see how they affect the future. In episode 2.7, she eavesdrops on a conversation in Cutter's cell to Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown) about how Cutter still cared for Helen. Although this is later revealed to be a ploy on Cutter's part, Helen still believes that he does care for her. She was aware of Claudia in the time before the change and denies being behind it. Despite being shown as the brains of the operation, Leek begins to challenge Helen and when their creatures are released, she calls Stephen and lies to him saying that she was kidnapped by James Lester (Ben Miller) and that Cutter was killed. She asked Stephen to rescue her and not to trust Lester. When Stephen arrives, she attempts to convince him to leave into the Anomalies until it is safe but he is determined for revenge. He encounters Cutter and learns that Helen lied to him. Stephen, Helen and Cutter work to contain the predators contained in Leek's base by luring them into the centre where the cages are located by ringing the bell that they associated with feeding time, to trap the creatures together so they will kill each other but Stephen is killed. Helen appears at Stephen's gravesite shortly after his funeral and states that the timeline can change, at which point several clones of  \"The Cleaner\" (Tim Faraday) appear, the result of her obtaining future cloning technology to create loyal minions.", "At first, his insistence that his wife Helen is alive in the first two and a half episodes is seen by some members of the time as initially somewhat foolish and unrealistic, most notably Claudia Brown (Lucy Brown). He then keeps the details of her visitations to himself, out of hurt pride that his wife could have left him alone for so long. This has terrible consequences later when the government found out. When the truth is known, not only does he lose the respect of Claudia but also brings the wrath of James Lester (Ben Miller) down on himself. After being tricked into leading Lester's troops to his wife the relationship between the two of them hit a new low as she is adamant that he had set her up and he finally lost patience with her evasions and riddles. She later escapes, and his motives for trying to follow her through the Anomaly are open to question.", "Due to changes in the timeline, the cause of which is unknown, Cutter remains one of two of the only currently identified characters (The second being Helen) to remain unaffected for reasons that are unknown. Cutter himself is confused as to how this happened. Cutter also immediately calls new P.R. guru Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown) \"Claudia\" after her doppelg\u00e4nger. This confuses the team a lot, and while Connor and Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) both show some sort of support they find it hard to accept what he is saying. Stephen and Cutter are now both quietly cautious of one another after the revelation of the affair and are no longer in full agreement of their methods. Cutter is not happy when he learns Stephen and Helen have been seeing each other in secret and punches him, showing he still has some feelings for Helen. In the series finale he learned Helen was working with traitor Oliver Leek (Karl Theobald) on anomaly research and acts out that he still cares about Helen but instead reveals he's going to turn her over to Lester before she escapes. He frees Leek's Future Predators and when he meets up with Helen and Stephen they agree to put an end to the predators Leek's captured. He is willing to sacrifice himself to save others but he is punched by Stephen, who takes his place inside the predator-filled room. Stephen asks Cutter to tell Connor and Abby to stay out of trouble, and is then killed. Having spent some time trying to get to know Jenny and learning she has a fianc\u00e9, but it is revealed they broke up and asked Cutter out for a drink but they were called away to an anomaly. Cutter shreds the picture of Claudia Brown at the end of the episode, showing he's decided to move on.", "Mick Harper is a journalist who is played by Ramon Tikaram. He first appears in episode 2.6, trying to interview a survivor of a Columbian mammoth's rampage on the M25. Like everyone else he had been told it was an elephant, unaware that the creature was actually a mammoth. He was unable to complete the interview because Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown) disrupted him. She used a sarcastic tone about it being a mammoth to throw him off, but Mick suspected there was more to the operation, and vowed to find out what was going on.", "He once again proves his concern for her welfare when he runs to her rescue in episode 1.4 when she is captured by Connor's parasite-ridden friend. However Claudia (Lucy Brown) - who is also angry for his running into trouble in the subway - and James Lester (Ben Miller) appear to have lost patience with him during the hunt for the Pteranodon.", "When Helen (Juliet Aubrey) and Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall) went to the Permian in episode 1.6, on their return the timeline had changed, Leek had replaced Claudia Brown (Lucy Brown) as James Lester's (Ben Miller) assistant.", "While remaining, for the most part, stubborn, paranoid, slow to face facts and wilfully ignorant, he has also displayed surprising bursts of astonishing foresight and knowledge as he guesses correctly that his assistant, Claudia Brown (Lucy Brown) has personal reasons for wanting Cutter to remain close by, and that Cutter was hiding something from them. He also guesses that Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) was lying in order to escape, \"I think I'd trust her just about as far as I can throw a Stegosaurus\", but is convinced otherwise by Claudia and Cutter, which proves to be a mistake on their part. He's usually right in the final analysis, especially on matters of human nature, when Cutter is usually wrong.", "In Series 3, Lester's fight become more personal when he discovers Christine Johnson (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) working against him, who he has connections to. In episode 3.3 he is rounded up and imprisoned with the rest of the ARC by Helen and her clones, and shows little surprise at Cutter's apparent betrayal \"So, Cutter's finally gone native\". When Cutter lies dying after the ARC explosion, Lester yells desperately for an ambulance for him. In the following episode he makes Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown) team leader, and then assigns Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) to the same role the episode after. When he discovers Connor living in the ARC with the two Diictodon he offers him his spare apartment, although later appears to be annoyed at the mess Connor and his \"pets\" make. In episode 3.6 he is stripped of command of the ARC by Christine, although with the help of Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield) he regains it later in the episode, telling Christine that she is \"sitting in his chair\" mirroring one of her lines earlier that episode. In episode 3.9 Lester commands Danny not to invade Christine's HQ to rescue Eve (Kate Magowan), and becomes annoyed at him when he does, and appears ready to hand Danny over to Christine until Eve is revealed as Helen.", "Jennifer \"Jenny\" Lewis is played by Lucy Brown and replaced a physically identical but temperamentally different character, Claudia Brown, played by the same actress. She is 28 years old. At the end of the first series, Claudia disappeared off the timeline, much to the horror of Nick Cutter (Douglas Henshall), who found it difficult to adjust when Jenny appeared, looking exactly like Claudia.", "When the ARC is attacked by Helen Cutter's (Juliet Aubrey) Cleaner Clones (Tim Faraday) in episode 3.3, she is captured along with Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown) and James Lester (Ben Miller). She is the one who makes the audio tape that eventually stops Helen's clones. Sarah makes it out of the fire raging inside the ARC and watches on in shock while Cutter is lying dead on the floor after Connor has brought him from the exploding building.", "He was investigating the death of two teenagers (one being his brother, Patrick) in a house believed to be haunted. He suspected Ryan Mason as the murderer, as he was the third teenager in the house, who escaped. Danny frequently went to the house to arrest trespassers, and at first thought the team were breaking in. He then arrests Connor Temple (Andrew-Lee Potts) and discovers a futuristic Camouflage beast, as well as the anomalies. He discovers that the creature was the one that murdered his brother. He shoots the Camouflage beast back through the anomaly. He returns, following the team on his motorbike when they arrive in an airport and pilots a helicopter through the anomaly so the Giganotosaurus that had come through followed him back. He is lucky to escape, as when he returns to the present he is being hunted by a pack of Giganotosaurus, and Connor locks the anomaly just in time. In the next episode he breaks into the ARC and, armed with flamethrowers, searches for a fungus from the future in the London underground with the team. He plans to burn it but Sarah Page (Laila Rouass) phones Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown) to warn him not to use the flamethrowers. The team manage to get the fungus into a van, then he drives it back into the ARC. They then lose the creature briefly, but it appears in the communications room, while Jenny is still there. He risks his life to go in the frozen room to distract the creature, thus saves Jenny's life. James Lester (Ben Miller) decides he will be the new team leader, as suggested by Jenny, who decided to leave. It was implied that he fancied Jenny, but she left the team too soon for any relationship to occur between them.", "In the second series, Connor also gets a new girlfriend called Caroline. Caroline and Connor meet in a DVD store and he invites her back to Abby's flat with him. After Connor nearly gets eaten by a giant worm in the episode and gets covered in giant worm slime, he accidentally wipes Caroline's number off his hand. Connor clearly worries about Caroline, and by the end of the episode seems to put her ahead of Abby, much to the latter's confusion. In episode 2.4, Connor is distraught when Abby is mistaken as dead, and searches for her. He does eventually find her, but is dragged into the future by the Mer. When Abby is dangling from the side of a cliff, Connor tells her that he loves her. Abby later confronts Connor about this, but due to embarrassment, did not re-approach the matter, and went on a date with Caroline, leaving Abby upset and confused. In episode 2.5, Connor dumps Caroline after he believes that the two are not ideal for one another. (In fact, unknown to him, Caroline has been paid by Leek to spy on Connor.) This now opens him up to Abby, and seeks Stephen Hart's (James Murray) help as he is still unsure of whether Abby is interested in him. Connor remained faithful to Abby throughout the final episode of the season, and drags her out of a fight with Caroline. Connor was shocked to find out that Caroline only went out with him because she was getting paid. Leek says that he and Connor are similar, saying that they are both \"Uncool, nerdy and never get the attractive girls\". To this Connor makes another sarcastic remark, saying \"Speak for yourself\". Connor is very caring towards Abby, Caroline and Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown), whom he makes sure all climb the ladder to escape before he does. Finally, Connor is seen at the end of the episode at Stephen's funeral. He seems close to Abby, but surprisingly Caroline is invited to the funeral, despite the fact the two characters never met. Caroline reminds Connor he has her mobile number and then quickly leaves. As Connor and Abby themselves leave, Abby makes to hold Connor's hand, but Cutter receives an urgent call of a high-priority anomaly. In one of the final scenes, Connor is seen in the back of Cutter's car with a gun, suggesting that Cutter is trusting him with guns."]}, {"page": "Adam Rayner", "response": ["Rayner's mother is American and father is English and also holds a dual citizenship for the United Kingdom and the United States.
