Although he could neither sing nor dance, he became a leading comedian in musical comedies, adapting the French and Viennese op\u00e9ra-bouffe style of light comic relief into a broader comedy popular with English audiences of the period. His comic portrayals did much to ensure the West End success of V\u00e9ronique (1904) The Little Michus (1905; for which he invented the Gazeka), and The Merry Widow (1907).In addition to musical comedy, operettas and revues, Graves specialised in pantomime and music hall. Later in his career, he was a frequent broadcaster and made several films, always in comic roles, but continued to perform on stage.  His last stage success was in Me and My Girl (1937).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1949", "response": ["** George Graves, British comic actor (b. 1876)"]}, {"page": "Flapper", "response": ["The standard non-slang usage appeared in print as early as 1903 in England and 1904 in the United States, when novelist Desmond Coke used it in his college story of Oxford life, Sandford of Merton: \"There's a stunning flapper\".

His usual act partly consisted of a running patter with the orchestra conductor, which he again did on this occasion; behind the conductor sat the royal party, and it looked to some that Formby was speaking disrespectfully to them. The king understood to whom Formby was talking, however, and afterwards presented him with a tiepin. In October Formby appeared in his second Royal Command Performance of the year, in a charity show organised by the French actress Sarah Bernhardt.
