Although he could neither sing nor dance, he became a leading comedian in musical comedies, adapting the French and Viennese op\u00e9ra-bouffe style of light comic relief into a broader comedy popular with English audiences of the period. His comic portrayals did much to ensure the West End success of V\u00e9ronique (1904) The Little Michus (1905; for which he invented the Gazeka), and The Merry Widow (1907).In addition to musical comedy, operettas and revues, Graves specialised in pantomime and music hall. Later in his career, he was a frequent broadcaster and made several films, always in comic roles, but continued to perform on stage.  His last stage success was in Me and My Girl (1937).", "link_mentions": {}}}
