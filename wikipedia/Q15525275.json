In 2010 Robert Buckland, a Conservative, gained South Swindon at the general election with a majority of just over 3500.  In 2015, the Conservative majority increased to 5785; in 2017, the Conservative majority fell to 2,464 on a 3.5% swing to Labour. In 2019, Buckland's majority rose to 6625 (13%) and 52% of the vote with a swing of 4.1% to Conservative. These patterns suggest a seat that is more marginal than its neighbour North Swindon,  and one which has acted as a bellwether of the national result.
