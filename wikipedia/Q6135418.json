He was born at Little Lever, near Bolton and died at Farnworth.\nHallows was a left-handed middle-order batsman and a left-arm bowler who converted early in his career from fast-medium to medium pace. He played a few games for Lancashire from 1898, but played regularly in 1901 with 1,170 runs at an average of more than 31 runs per innings. He was less successful in the two following seasons, but in 1904, a season in which Lancashire were expected to struggle following the departure of Sydney Barnes, Hallows achieved the all-rounders \"double\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Lancashire won the County Championship and Hallows was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1905 edition of the almanack.In the 1905 season, though his batting remained useful, his bowling fell away and he played only a handful of matches for the county in 1906 and 1907 as his health grew worse: he had epilepsy.\nHallows was the uncle of Charlie Hallows, the Lancashire and England opening batsman of the 1920s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1904 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Bernard Bosanquet, Ernest Halliwell, James Hallows, Percy Perrin, Reggie Spooner"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  James Hallows"]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Lancashire won its first county championship in 1897, a productive bowling attack made up of Johnny Briggs, Willis Cuttell, Albert Hallam, and Arthur Mold took 420\u00a0wickets between them. In 1898 Lancashire bought the ground and some adjoining land from the de Traffords for \u00a324,732 (\u00a3 in ). In 1902, amateur and professional players began walking onto the field side by side in a break with tradition. Lancashire won its second championship title in 1904, going undefeated throughout the season; Wisden described the season as \u201cthe brightest in the history of Lancashire cricket\u201d. That season, James Hallows completed the feat of 1,000\u00a0runs and 100\u00a0wickets in the season. During the late 1900s and early 1910s, players such as Walter Brearley, Harry Dean, and Bill Huddleston were the mainstays of Lancashire bowling. The club began to experience financial problems during this same period; the increased popularity of other sports was blamed for the dip in attendances. In 1914, Lancashire sank to its lowest position of eleventh, whilst during World War I the pavilion was used by the Red Cross and 1,800 patients were treated there."]}, {"page": "1904 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden - Bernard Bosanquet, Ernest Halliwell, James Hallows, Percy Perrin, Reggie Spooner ", "|| James Hallows || Lancashire || 24 || 5319 || 108 || 18.71"]}, {"page": "List of people from Bolton", "response": ["*James Hallows (1873\u20131910) \u2013 county cricketer, Wisden Cricketer of the Year, 1905."]}, {"page": "Hallows (surname)", "response": ["* James Hallows (1873-1910), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Ernest Shorrocks", "response": ["A professional who batted in the lower order and bowled 20 overs in his one match, Shorrocks was picked for the Somerset match against Lancashire at Taunton.
