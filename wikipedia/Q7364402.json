A dying Psi Division Judge had predicted disaster for Mega-City One unless it was ruled by a boy with a birthmark shaped like an eagle, so Dredd set off into the Cursed Earth, to Texas City, and into deep space in search of the boy, Owen Krysler, and his kidnappers, the Angel Gang. The Angels were some of the most memorable villains Wagner had yet devised, but suffered the same mortality problem that had plagued the strip so far. All of them were killed during the course of the story, however the Mean Machine, was later resurrected by Krysler during \"Destiny's Angels\". \"The Judge Child\" was drawn by Bolland, Ron Smith and Mike McMahon in rotation, and the later episodes marked the beginning of Wagner's long-running writing partnership with Alan Grant. The pair would go on to write Strontium Dog, Robo-Hunter and many other stories for 2000 AD, as well as for Roy of the Rovers, Battle and the relaunched Eagle in the United Kingdom, and a number of comics in America.", "* Ron Smith"]}, {"page": "Judge Anderson", "response": ["** \u201cCity of the Damned\", written by John Wagner and Alan Grant, art by Steve Dillon (episodes 1, 5\u20137, 12\u201313), Ron Smith (2\u20133, 10, 14), Kim Raymond (4, 11) and Ian Gibson (8\u20139), in 2000 AeD #393\u2013406 (1984)", "** \u201cThe Graveyard Shift,\u201d written by John Wagner and Alan Grant, art by Ron Smith, in 2000 AD #335\u2013341 (1983)", "** \"Silence Isn't Golden,\" written by John Wagner, art by Ron Smith, in the Daily Star 17 August 1985"]}, {"page": "Transformers", "response": ["In 1986, the cartoon became the film The Transformers: The Movie, which is set in the year 2005.
