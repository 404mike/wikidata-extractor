At the conclusion of the episode, Helen sets up an operational headquarters in the present day, assisted by the clones. In episode 3.3, after taking the ARC with her clones, she attempts to explain herself to Cutter that she can prevent future atrocities (such as the rise of the Future Predators) by actively changing timelines in the past so that evolution and history take a different path. Cutter rejects this, insisting that Helen has no right to meddle. Helen also seems to believe that Cutter's work with the ARC is in some way responsible for the atrocities she has seen in the future and thus intended to kill him in order to avoid it once he translates the artefact for her. She is caught in the blast from the bomb in the ARC and Cutter returns to rescue her only for her to shoot him and leave him to die. Donning the alias of Eve (Kate Magowan), she uses Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) to get into the new ARC headquarters to regain the artefact, now believing that the only means to ensure the Future Predators' timeline never occurs is by negating humanity itself. She attempts to do this in the finale of Series 3 and is responsible for the death of the so-called \"First Family\". She briefly confronts Danny in the Pliocene, stating that when humanity is gone, other species will be able to develop in peace with no war or pollution. Helen is killed by a raptor before she can complete her mission.", "In episode 3.6, Christine's hidden cameras inside the ARC allowed her to learn they had the artefact, and had the Minister appoint to be in charge of the ARC, getting rid of Lester, but the team escaped with the artefact. She is forced to leave when Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield) betrays her by recording her abusing the Minister, and Lester sent it to the Minister. She did so vowing \"It's not over\", mirroring Lester from earlier. However she didn't give up trying to take control of the ARC, and in episode 3.8 she sent Wilder though her anomaly and he returned with a woman from the future called Eve (Kate Magowan). In episode 3.9 her attempts to get information from her were interrupted by Danny, who escaped with Eve. Christine had a warrant for Danny's arrest, the return of Eve and the custody of the artefact when she arrived at the ARC, however Eve was revealed to be Helen, who kidnapped Christine and stole the artefact. Helen revealed Christine was the cause of the destruction in the future because of her ambitions before kicking her through the anomaly in her HQ. She returns, blood-spattered and terrified, and the team attempt to save her, only for a Future Predator to stick its head through the anomaly and growl at them. This causes them to let go of Christine, and she is dragged screaming through the anomaly, which closes on her, and is presumably killed by the Future Predator.", "In Series 3, Lester's fight become more personal when he discovers Christine Johnson (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) working against him, who he has connections to. In episode 3.3 he is rounded up and imprisoned with the rest of the ARC by Helen and her clones, and shows little surprise at Cutter's apparent betrayal \"So, Cutter's finally gone native\". When Cutter lies dying after the ARC explosion, Lester yells desperately for an ambulance for him. In the following episode he makes Jenny Lewis (Lucy Brown) team leader, and then assigns Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) to the same role the episode after. When he discovers Connor living in the ARC with the two Diictodon he offers him his spare apartment, although later appears to be annoyed at the mess Connor and his \"pets\" make. In episode 3.6 he is stripped of command of the ARC by Christine, although with the help of Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield) he regains it later in the episode, telling Christine that she is \"sitting in his chair\" mirroring one of her lines earlier that episode. In episode 3.9 Lester commands Danny not to invade Christine's HQ to rescue Eve (Kate Magowan), and becomes annoyed at him when he does, and appears ready to hand Danny over to Christine until Eve is revealed as Helen.", "While checking security in the ARC he breaks through the ventilation shafts and then battles the terror birds, tricking them into the anomaly by using a loud speakerphone recording of their calling.

During a trip to the future in episode 3.8, he witnessed Eve (Kate Magowan) - Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) in disguise - enter the present, and in the following episode rescued her from Christine Johnson's (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) base, returning her to the ARC before realising who she really was. Along with Connor, Sarah, Abby Maitland (Hannah Spearritt) and Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield) he follows her back to Christine's HQ and witnesses the death of Christine at the hands of a Future Predator. In the following episode he travels back to the future with Connor and Abby, only to chase Helen into the past, and onwards into the deeper past alone, after Connor is injured. Danny witnesses the death of Helen in the deep past, and assures that the human race survives, before finding himself stranded when the anomaly closes. Trapped, alone in the past, Danny cries out in anger as Series 3 draws to a close.", "Captain Wilder, played by Alex McSweeney, is Christine Johnson's (Belinda Stewart-Wilson) head of security in Series 3.

This fails, and Lester appoints Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng) instead. It is also revealed that Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield) from the ARC knew Wilder at Sandhurst. Later Wilder is recognised by Danny at a distance, leading to the discovery that Wilder and Christine have captured Eve (Kate Magowan) - actually the disguised Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) - from the future.
