In its story, Ziggy wins the hearts of fans but suffers a fall from grace after succumbing to his own ego. The character was inspired by numerous musicians, including singers Vince Taylor and Iggy Pop. Most of the album's concept was developed after the songs were recorded. The album's music has been characterised as glam rock and proto-punk. Influences included Iggy Pop, the Velvet Underground, and Marc Bolan of T. Rex. The album's lyrics discuss the artificiality of rock music, political issues, drug use, sexual orientation and stardom. The album cover, photographed in monochrome and recoloured, was taken in London, outside the home of furriers \"K. West\".", "One of the main inspirations for Ziggy Stardust was English singer Vince Taylor, whom Bowie met after Taylor had a mental breakdown and believed himself to be a cross between a god and an alien. Iggy Pop, singer of the proto-punk band the Stooges, provided another main inspiration. Bowie had recently become infatuated with the singer and took influence from him for his next record, both musically and lyrically. Other influences for the character included Bowie's earlier album The Man Who Sold the World, Lou Reed, singer and guitarist of the Velvet Underground, Marc Bolan, singer and guitarist of glam rock band T. Rex, and the cult musician Legendary Stardust Cowboy. An alternative theory is that, during a tour, Bowie developed the concept of Ziggy as a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing \"the ultimate pop idol\". Woodmansey also cited guitarist and singer Jimi Hendrix and the progressive rock band King Crimson as influences."]}, {"page": "Isleworth", "response": ["* Vince Taylor (1939\u20131991), British rock and roll singer and main inspiration for David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust persona, spent his early life in Isleworth."]}, {"page": "Sylvie Vartan", "response": ["It was another hit, that served her first concert in Paris Olympia Hall on 12 December 1961. \"Est-ce que tu le sais?\", her version of Ray Charles' \"What'd I Say\", was quickly released.

Shelley originated the persona of Alvin Stardust, writing, recording and singing the first Stardust single, \"My Coo Ca Choo\", in 1973.
