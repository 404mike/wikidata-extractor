He succeeded in keeping the party in the public eye and in maintaining its independence from the Liberals for the length of the 1983 Parliament.

The party polled well at its first election, its candidate coming a close second in the 1989 Richmond by-election, but thereafter a string of poor and ultimately disastrous by-election results followed, including coming behind the Official Monster Raving Loony Party in the Bootle by-election of May 1990, prompting Owen to wind up the party in 1990.

A Liberal conference in September found delegates providing a landslide majority for the merger. Formal negotiations launched that month and in December it produced a draft constitution for the new party.

It subsequently disbanded, although a third SDP was formed, which currently operates on a much less influential scale.
