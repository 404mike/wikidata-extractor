The second defence praised Oliver Cromwell, now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. Alexander Morus, to whom Milton wrongly attributed the Clamor (in fact by Peter du Moulin), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical Defensio pro se in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, Georg Rudolph Wecklein, then Philip Meadows, and from 1657 by the poet Andrew Marvell."]}, {"page": "1670", "response": ["* September 28 \u2013 Alexander Morus, Franco-Scottish Calvinist preacher (b. 1616)"]}, {"page": "1616", "response": ["* September 25 \u2013 Alexander Morus, Franco-Scottish Calvinist preacher (d. 1670)"]}, {"page": "Morus", "response": ["* Alexander Morus (1616\u20131670), Franco-Scottish Protestant preacher"]}, {"page": "Helvetic Consensus", "response": ["The famous and flourishing school of Saumur came to be looked upon with increasing mistrust as the seat of heterodoxy, especially by the Swiss, who were in the habit of sending students there. The first impulse to attack the new doctrine came from Geneva, seat of historical Calvinism. In 1635 Friedrich Spanheim wrote against Amyraut, whom the clergy of Paris tried to defend. In course of time Amyraldism gained ground in Geneva. In 1649, Alexander Morus, the successor of Spanheim, but suspected of belonging to the liberal party, was compelled by the magistrates of Geneva to subscribe to a series of articles in the form of theses and antitheses, the first germ of the Formula consensus. His place was taken by Philippe Mestrezat, and later by Louis Tronchin (de), both inclined toward the liberal tendency of France, while Francis Turretin defended the traditional system. Mestrezat induced the Council of Geneva to take a moderate stand point in the article on election, but the other cantons of Switzerland objected to this new tendency and threatened to stop sending their pupils to Geneva."]}, {"page": "Alexander morus", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Morus "]}, {"page": "Alexander More", "response": ["* Alexander Morus (1616\u20131670), or More, Franco-Scottish Calvinist preacher"]}, {"page": "Defensio Secunda", "response": ["Only a few months after Cromwell was made Lord Protector over England, Milton published a tract titled Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio Secunda.
