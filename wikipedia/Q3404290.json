After training for the ministry at the Presbyterian College in Carmarthen and afterwards at Highbury College, London, he spent about eighteen months in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he was ordained to the Christian ministry. He returned to Wales and in 1850 he was inducted minister at Bwlchnewydd and Gibeon in Carmarthenshire, before succeeding his father as the principal of Bala Independent College in 1855.\n\nHis name is closely linked with the attempt to establish a Welsh settlement in Patagonia, Argentina, in the 1860s where Welsh would be the language of religion, government, trade, and education. The 150th anniversary (28 July 1865) of this Welsh-Argentine settlement in Rawson, Chubut Argentina was celebrated in 2015.In 1889, Jones became a member of the first Merionethshire County Council, although he had a majority of only eight votes over his Conservative opponent.Jones is recognised as the first to advocate a political solution to defending Welsh identity and therefore is seen as one of the most significant forerunners of Welsh nationalism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Y Wladfa", "response": ["Y Wladfa (, \"The Colony\"),National Library of Wales' bibliography for 'The Welsh settlement in Patagonia' also occasionally Y Wladychfa Gymreig (, \"The Welsh Settlement\"),Gwladychfa Gymreig, being an essay by the Rev.

Jones (1822\u201398)", "The idea of a Welsh colony in Patagonia was put forward by Michael D. Jones, a Welsh nationalist nonconformist preacher based in Bala, Gwynedd, who had called for a new \"little Wales beyond Wales\". He spent some years in the United States, where he observed that Welsh immigrants assimilated very quickly compared with other peoples and often lost much of their Welsh identity. Thus, the original proposal was to establish a new Wales overseas where Welsh settlers and their culture would be generally free from foreign domination. He proposed setting up a Welsh-speaking colony away from the influence of the English language. He recruited settlers and provided financing; Australia, New Zealand and even Palestine were considered, but Patagonia was chosen for its isolation and the Argentines' offer of  of land along the Chubut River in exchange for settling the still-unconquered land of Patagonia for Argentina. Patagonia, including the Chubut Valley was claimed by Buenos Aires but it has little control over the area which was also claimed by Chile. Michael D Jones had been corresponding with the Argentinean government about settling an area known as Bah\u00eda Blanca where Welsh immigrants could preserve their language and culture.
