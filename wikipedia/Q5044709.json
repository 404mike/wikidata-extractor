If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live television, in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing.

It focused on the theme of \"The Best of British\" focusing on food, entertainment and celebrities in a mid-afternoon slot. The focus of the show later shifted towards gossip, entertainment and a light-hearted discussion of sex tips. The latter was dropped after viewer complaints and a shift to a late afternoon 5\u00a0pm slot in 2010. The show usually opened with a review of gossip and current affairs stories of the day with regular guests including Gloria Hunniford, Carole Malone, Penny Smith, Nick Ferrari, Janet Street Porter, Jane McDonald and Emma Forbes offering their opinions. The programme resumed the studio debate format at half-past the hour with a \"heated\" discussion on the main \"hot topic\" of the day. The programme also included regular cookery slots with Nadia Sawalha or Claire Richards with Titchmarsh adopting a comical, \"hands-on\" role as a hopeless cookery assistant. In Shrager's cookery demonstrations, the pair alternated between bickering and flirting with visual \"humour\" and numerous double entendres from the host. A wine-tasting panel often featured along with items on flower-arranging, pets and gardening, the latter involving Titchmarsh answering viewer's horticultural questions assisted by studio guests. The show usually concluded with Titchmarsh interviewing a major celebrity or public figure and also contained regular musical items with live studio performances.
