This essentially served as an incentive for the groups to create a cover name.  As a result, the actual existence of the RHD has consistently been called into question. Jim Cusack and Henry McDonald have argued that the RHD and the Orange Volunteers are both overseen by a Christian fundamentalist preacher they identify only as the Pastor. The Pastor, a former associate of William McGrath, John McKeague and George Seawright and a long-established British intelligence agent, is said by the authors to provide his own form of fundamentalist, anti-Catholic Protestantism to the two groups' fluid membership of young men, most of whom are also UDA or LVF members.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF: Endgame, Poolbeg, 2008, pp. 376-382"]}, {"page": "Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["In 1983, Cecil Walker regained the seat for the UUP, beating Scotsman George Seawright of the DUP.
