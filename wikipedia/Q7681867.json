The Very Revd Catherine Ogle, Dean of Winchester, writes in the catalogue:  \"I've really come to love Chris Gollon's work and the expressive ways that he represents the human form with exaggeration creating a greater realism.\" The fine art catalogue also documents and reproduces a first time some of the images that Chris Gollon added to his 2014\u20132016 touring exhibition to cathedrals, those that do not appear in the Incarnation, Mary & Women from the Bible catalogue. These include 'Judas's Wife' (thought to be the first image in art history of her), 'Jesus Heals the Sick' (first shown in Durham Cathedral, 2015) and 'Jesus & The Woman Taken in Adultery (Jesus Draws in the Dust)' (a large triptych also first shown in Durham Cathedral, 2015)."]}]}}
