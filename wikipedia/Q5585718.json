Reece was credited with softening the tone of Thatcher's voice and improving her stuffy dress sense, to broaden her public appeal, and he also encouraged her to adopt and embrace the title of \"The Iron Lady\" (first coined by the USSR) to convey the strength of her unwavering political resolve and unbending character. These were services for which Reece was subsequently knighted. He was to correctly predict that Thatcher would not stand in another General Election following her third (1987) landslide victory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Thatcher", "response": ["Television critic Clive James, writing in The Observer prior to her election as Conservative Party leader, compared her voice of 1973 to \"a cat sliding down a blackboard\".

Thatcher's advisers, Gordon Reece and Timothy Bell, co-ordinated their presentation with the editor of The Sun, Larry Lamb. The Sun printed a series of articles by disillusioned former Labour ministers (Reg Prentice, Richard Marsh, Lord George-Brown, Alfred Robens and Lord Chalfont) detailing why they had switched their support to Thatcher. She explicitly asked Labour voters for their support when she launched her campaign in Cardiff, claiming that Labour was now extreme. Choosing to start her campaign in the strongly Labour-supporting city was part of Thatcher's strategy of appealing to skilled manual workers (NRS social group C2), whom both parties had previously seen as certain Labour voters; she thought that many of these would support her promises to reduce unions' power and enact the Right to Buy their homes. An analysis of the election result showed that the Conservatives gained an 11% swing among the skilled working class (the C2s) and a 9% swing amongst the unskilled working class (the DEs)."]}, {"page": "Winter of Discontent", "response": ["To implement the media strategy, the party hired the advertising firm of Saatchi & Saatchi, whose 1978 \"Labour Isn't Working\" campaign has been credited with persuading Callaghan not to hold an election that year.
