He had a long career in county cricket, playing over 500 games combined between first-class and List A, primarily with Warwickshire before ending his career at Derbyshire. He also played two Test matches for England in the 1992 series against Pakistan, and went on a number of England A tours. A medium pace bowler and lower order batsman, cricket writer Colin Bateman stated, \"at 6ft 6in, with an ability to make the ball swing, Munton is at his best in English conditions\". His time at Warwickshire was a particularly successful one for the club, winning 6 trophies between 1993 and 1995; as a crucial part of that side, Munton was honoured as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1995.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 30", "response": ["*1965 \u2013 Tim Munton, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Tim Munton"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["*    Tim Munton"]}, {"page": "Birmingham and District Premier League", "response": ["* Tim Munton"]}, {"page": "Joey Benjamin", "response": ["Benjamin signed his first county contract for Warwickshire in 1988, when he was 27.

Broad originally started his cricketing career as an opening batsman, following in the footsteps of his father, the former England opener and current ICC match referee Chris Broad. It was not until he was 17 and had a growth spurt that he started to consider being a fast bowler. Broad had been associated with Leicestershire since he was 8 years old, having represented them at Under-9 level, and played for Melton Mowbray club Egerton Park, which also produced England seamer Tim Munton. Broad played for Egerton Park from the ages of 9 to 19; in his final two seasons he opened the batting with fellow Leicestershire player Matthew Boyce and spearheaded the attack.

After rain wiped out the first day Lara soon found himself in the middle as Middlesex chose to field first and Warwickshire lost an early wicket. He made 26 before edging a leg side delivery from Richard Johnson through to the wicket-keeper. The visitors were all out for 211, with no batsman passing fifty. Desmond Haynes was dismissed off the first ball of the reply but Middlesex lost no further wickets in the remainder of the day. Mike Roseberry and Mike Gatting, not out overnight, shared 77 for the second wicket before the latter was dismissed for 52. Roseberry also shared 79 with Mark Ramprakash (37) before going on to complete a 17th first-class century. He was ninth out as the middle and lower order offered little resistance and Middlesex's lead was restricted to 38. The deficit was turned into a lead by the close with Lara scoring a 52-ball half-century. He completed a sixth century in seven innings on the final morning, adding 85 from 84 balls, that quick scoring enabled a declaration leaving Middlesex a target of 269 from 50 overs. They began well, reaching 129/1 before Tim Munton took the wickets of Gatting and Ramprakash in consecutive deliveries followed by Roseberry in his next over. The chase continued but another double strike from Munton left Middlesex to settle for the draw.", "Warwickshire won the toss and built a formidable first day total of 448/9 after Brian Lara scored an eighth century in eleven innings. His score of 197 took 195 balls and contained 30 fours and 3 sixes. The only bowler to contain Lara was Curtly Ambrose who conceded 12 runs from the 45 balls he delivered to him. The second highest score was 39 from Trevor Penney who put on 168 in 31 overs with Lara. The last wicket partnership between Graeme Welch and Tim Munton grew to 68 before the innings was ended. Early in the reply Munton took the wickets of both openers before a 137 run partnership between Allan Lamb and Rob Bailey (54) recovered the situation. Welch, on his Championship debut, took the wickets of Lamb, Bailey and Mal Loye in a 22 ball spell and Northamptonshire lost their last 5 wickets for 27 runs allowing Warwickshire to enforce the follow on. Northamptonshire fared better second time around despite losing their first four wickets by the time the score reached 83. Loye and Kevin Curran (56) repaired the innings so the hosts ended day three with a lead of 84 runs and three wickets remaining. Loye, 99 overnight, reached his century before his seven-hour innings was ended. The resistance was continued by Russell Warren (94) and tail-ender Paul Taylor who took 113 balls for his 26. Needing 228 in 38 overs, Warwickshire won with three balls to spare. Dominic Ostler and Roger Twose (39) shared a fourth consecutive century opening stand while Penney, promoted to number three, added 43.", "Surrey chose to bowl first on a green pitch and made use of the conditions to reduce Warwickshire to 52/5. Paul Smith suffered injuries to his hand and elbow but batted on to score 34 in two hours while Graeme Welch and Dougie Brown (54) both scored maiden first-class fifties putting on 110 for the ninth wicket. Alec Stewart and Graham Thorpe (38) added 107 for the second wicket before losing five wickets to the medium pace of Roger Twose in a nine over spell on the first evening. The last four wickets fell inside half an hour on the second morning, Tim Munton took three of those while Twose took the other to finish with career best figures. Opener Andy Moles scored his first century of the season and with contributions from Brian Lara (44) and  Twose (31), Warwickshire built a substantial lead by the end of the second day. The best support came from Neil Smith who scored 57 and added 131 with Moles for the sixth wicket. Moles remained unbeaten, his innings breaking the record for the highest at the ground. By the close of the third day Surrey had lost five wickets. The lower order scored quickly on the final morning but could not prevent a heavy defeat. Munton and Neil Smith bowled throughout the final session, Munton took 5/96 to end with match figures of 9/137 and Smith took four wickets.", "Winning the toss, Warwickshire batted aggressively in their first innings. Brian Lara top scored with 70 from 81 balls, which included 11 fours and a six; there were also fifties from Andy Moles and Neil Smith. In the field Nick Knight took five catches, equalling the county record, and affected a run out. Before the close Essex had lost two wickets to Graeme Welch. Essex batted unconvincingly and only saved the follow-on by four runs. Knight scored his first championship half-century for two years and Nasser Hussain added 53 but both were caught by Keith Piper who took seven catches in the innings, a county record. Tim Munton took the last six wickets to fall, five in a twelve over spell after lunch. Moles and Roger Twose shared a century opening stand and Warwickshire closed the second day on 156/3, a lead of 302. Twose was dismissed early on the third day and the last seven wickets added 106 to increase the lead past 400. Opener Knight was the mainstay of Essex's second innings, he scored more than half the total and was last man out for 113. The second highest score was 26 from Jonathan Lewis who added 79 with Knight for the second wicket. Munton dismissed Lewis and Hussain before Dougie Brown was introduced and took four quick wickets, Munton returned to take Knight, his tenth wicket of the match.", "Derbyshire won the toss and on a green pitch bowled first. Brian Lara struck his eighth century of the season including a hundred, off 94 balls, before lunch. He put on 160 for the fourth wicket with Trevor Penney (41) who was the only other batsman to pass 17. Tim Munton took three wickets as Derbyshire closed day one on 165/6. On the second morning Munton took the remaining four wickets in 23 balls to finish with 7/52, his seventh five wicket haul and best figures of the season. Dominic Ostler and Andy Moles (63) added 114 in 29 overs for the third wicket after the fall of Lara for 51 off 45. Derbyshire captain Kim Barnett took the wicket of Moles which sparked a collapse from 190/2, his leg-spin took five wickets while off-spinner Matthew Vandrau claimed three. The second day closed with Derbyshire on 26/1 in pursuit of 342. Munton took two wickets in his opening spell to reduce the hosts to 35/4, from there wickets fell regularly with off-spinner Neil Smith taking 5/69. Wicket-keeper Keith Piper took seven dismissals in the innings, equalling the Warwickshire record for the second match running. He also took 11 dismissals in the match which broke the county record and was one short of the first-class record.", "Warwickshire won the toss and fielded first on an overcast day and slow pitch. Stand-in captain Tim Munton took an early wicket but Nottinghamshire dominated the first day with Paul Pollard scoring a century in 295 minutes. He shared hundred partnerships with both Graeme Archer (41) and Paul Johnson (63) as the visitors closed a curtailed opening day on 268/4. Chris Lewis dominated the scoring on day two, taking his overnight score of 20 to 220 not out by the time of the declaration. He scored 21 fours and 6 sixes in his innings, and added 157 in 27 overs with Kevin Evans. Warwickshire lost three wickets in the remaining 20 over session. Warwickshire were made to follow on despite lower order resistance from Graeme Welch. He scored a career best 84 not out sharing in an eighth wicket stand of 68 with Neil Smith and added 86 with tail-enders Gladstone Small and Munton. Following on, Brian Lara was dismissed for a duck which brought his season average below 100 for the first time. The hosts closed day three on 134/3 with Roger Twose unbeaten on 74. Twose and overnight partner, Trevor Penney, were both dismissed inside the first 10 overs of the final day to reduce hopes of drawing the match. Three other wickets fell before lunch and Nottinghamshire's victory was achieved 45 minutes after the interval when Munton fell to Lewis, his sixth of the match.", "After rain delayed the start until 2.30pm, Sussex won the toss and batted first. They made a solid start, reaching 59/1 after 90 minutes of play before Roger Twose in his fourth over took three wickets. Jamie Hall and Peter Moores (29) steadied the innings with a partnership of 42 but the wicket of Hall caused a collapse from 103/4 to 131 all out. Warwickshire lost two wickets in the remaining three overs. With the visitors on 67/5 the match was evenly poised but Dominic Ostler and Trevor Penney (24) put on 67 for the sixth wicket, Ostler was the only player to score a half-century in the match. A ninth wicket stand of 30 between Graeme Welch and Gladstone Small increased the lead past 50, substantial under the circumstances. Sussex lost regular wickets in their second innings and closed day two on 107/8 with top scoring Martin Speight unbeaten on 38. Tim Munton dismissed Speight with the second ball of the third day and shortly afterwards took the final wicket to finish with eight wickets in the match. Requiring 76 to win, openers Andy Moles and Twose saw Warwickshire to victory without loss.", "Hampshire chose to bat first on winning the toss; they began slowly before a collapse of five wickets for ten runs in eight overs. The position of 129/1 had been built by Paul Terry who scored 71 and shared stands of 74 and 55 with Tony Middleton (18) and Giles White (30) respectively. They recovered from 139/6 with Shaun Udal adding 64 and Rajesh Maru scoring 32. By the close Hampshire had been dismissed, Tim Munton finishing the innings with his fourth wicket of the day and 500th of his career. Warwickshire dominated a curtailed second day, scoring 210 in three hours of play. Andy Moles was the sole wicket to fall, and that brought together left-handers Roger Twose and Brian Lara who shared an unbeaten second wicket stand of 156 in 28 overs. When play was abandoned Lara had scored 89 from 93 balls and Twose 84 from 121. The partnership was extended to 295, the highest for any Warwickshire wicket against Hampshire. Lara's score was his ninth century for the club and took him past 2,000 runs for the season. Twose's innings of 137 took five hours and contained 19 boundaries. After their dismissals the middle order looked to score quickly but rain again restricted play. Warwickshire closed with a lead of 205 and four wickets remaining. They batted on for 40 minutes into the final morning increasing the lead by 53 runs. Munton dismissed both openers before spinners Neil Smith and Richard Davis took over, taking the remaining eight wickets including a spell of five wickets in five overs.
