His grandfather and grandmother were John Gregg Fee and Matilda Fee, Abolitionist leaders from Kentucky. Embree had a very close relationship with his grandfather, the founder and president of Berea College. His father was discharged from the Union Army, after he took a job as a telegrapher with the Union Pacific Railroad. His father died in 1891, so his mother took her four children and moved with her parents to Berea. Embree's grandfather John Fee formed Embree's values and character at an early age, so he followed his grandfather examples. Edwin went to school at Berea and Yale, became a lecturer, and had many other outstanding accomplishments throughout his life. He died in 1950."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2007", "response": ["* John Fee, 43, Northern Irish nationalist politician (SDLP), brain tumour."]}, {"page": "2001 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |John Fee", "| align=\"right\" |John Feehan"]}, {"page": "1997 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |John Fee"]}, {"page": "1993 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |John Fee"]}, {"page": "1989 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |John Fee"]}, {"page": "Forum for Peace and Reconciliation", "response": ["|| SDLP || 5 || John Hume, Seamus Mallon, Eddie McGrady, Joe Hendron, Br\u00edd Rodgers || Sean Farren, Denis Haughey, Mark Durkan, John Fee, Alex Attwood"]}, {"page": "Fee (surname)", "response": ["*John Fee (1963\u20132007), Irish nationalist politician"]}, {"page": "2001 South Armagh attacks", "response": ["The injured forces were airlifted to hospitals, one of whom suffered severe face burns.
