His work involves Machine Learning for Big Data. \nLahav served as the UCL Head of Astrophysics (2004-2011), Vice-Dean (Research) of UCL's Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (2011-2015), and as Vice-President of the Royal Astronomical Society (2010-2012). He is one of the founders of the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and he co-chaired the international DES Science Committee from inception until 2016. He chairs both the DES:UK and DESI:UK consortia, as well as the DES Advisory Board. He previously served as a member of the STFC Science Board (2016-2019). From 2012 to 2018, Lahav held a European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant on \"Testing the Dark Energy Paradigm\" (TESTDE programme).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of cosmologists", "response": ["* Ofer Lahav (1959\u2013) studied dark matter and dark energy"]}, {"page": "International Astronomical Youth Camp", "response": ["The IAYC attracts all kinds of participants: those who enjoy astronomy as a general interest to those make it their job.

This came from a six-week project at the University of Hertfordshire funded by a Nuffield bursary. He read Natural Sciences at Magdalene College, Cambridge and in 2006 received a PhD in astrophysics from University College London, for his thesis on the early stages of star formation supervised by Ofer Lahav."]}, {"page": "George Darwin Lectureship", "response": ["*2020: Ofer Lahav"]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (O)", "response": ["*Ofer Lahav"]}, {"page": "List of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev people", "response": ["* Ofer Lahav (born 1959)"]}]}}
