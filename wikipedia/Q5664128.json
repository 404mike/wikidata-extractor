She exhibited her first piece, a fruit painting, in 1796 at 21 years old. She had a rocky relationship with the academy due to the sexism that was predominant in the art world and in society at the time. This relationship was characterized by Byrne's inability to decide whether or not to continue to be a part of the academy. Byrne became a full member of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1809, withdrew her membership in 1813, rejoined in 1821, and left again in 1834. Harriet Gouldsmith, one of Byrne's contemporaries, wrote that when art of the time was praised, \"the highest praise bestowed [and] publicly exhibited\u2026 was in great measure retracted when the picture was understood to be the production of a female\". Although Gouldsmith wrote about her own work, this experience was widespread among females in art at the time. The effect is still noticeable today due to the lack of documentation of Anne Frances Byrne and her contemporaries. The works of women in this time were often less respected simply due to the gender of the artist, and not based upon the merit of the work itself."]}, {"page": "Isabelle de Steiger", "response": ["* Harriet Gouldsmith"]}, {"page": "Ann Charlotte Bartholomew", "response": ["* Harriet Gouldsmith"]}, {"page": "Maria Bell", "response": ["* Harriet Gouldsmith"]}, {"page": "Martha Darley Mutrie", "response": ["* Harriet Gouldsmith"]}, {"page": "Gouldsmith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harriet Gouldsmith"]}]}}
