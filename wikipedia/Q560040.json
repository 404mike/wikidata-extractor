Davies is its only consistent member, and composed some of the band's best known songs, including \"Rudy\", \"Bloody Well Right\", \"Crime of the Century\" , \"From Now On\", \"Ain't Nobody But Me\", \"Gone Hollywood\", \"Goodbye Stranger\", \"Just Another Nervous Wreck\", \"Cannonball\", and \"I'm Beggin' You\". He is generally noted for his rhythmic blues piano solos and jazz-tinged progressive rock compositions and cynical lyrics.\nStarting with the self-titled  Supertramp in 1970, Davies shared lead vocals with Supertramp songwriting partner, Roger Hodgson until the latter's departure in 1983, at which point he became the sole lead vocalist of the group. Davies's voice is deeper than Hodgson's, and he usually employs a raspy baritone which stands in stark contrast to his bandmate's tenor. However, he occasionally sings in a falsetto which superficially resembles Hodgson's vocals, such as on \"Goodbye Stranger\" and \"My Kind of Lady\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 22", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Rick Davies, English singer-songwriter and keyboard player "]}, {"page": "Swindon", "response": ["*Rick Davies from Supertramp was born and brought up in Swindon."]}, {"page": "1944 in music", "response": ["*July 22 \u2013 Rick Davies, keyboardist (Supertramp)"]}, {"page": "Supertramp", "response": ["Supertramp were an English rock band formed in London, England in mid 1969. Marked by the individual songwriting of founders Roger Hodgson (vocals, keyboards, and guitars) and Rick Davies (vocals and keyboards), they are distinguished for blending progressive rock and pop styles as well as for a sound that relied heavily on Wurlitzer electric piano. The group's line-up changed numerous times throughout their career, with Davies being the only consistent member throughout the decades. Other longtime members included bassist Dougie Thomson, drummer Bob Siebenberg, and saxophonist John Helliwell.", "In 1969 Stanley \"Sam\" August Miesegaes, a Dutch millionaire, ceased providing financial support to a band called The Joint, as he was disappointed with them. He offered Swindon-born keyboardist Rick Davies, a former bandmate of Irish singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan, whose talent he felt had been \"bogged down\" by the group, an opportunity to form his own band with Miesegaes's financial backing. Davies assembled Roger Hodgson (bass and vocals), Richard Palmer (guitars and vocals), and Keith Baker (percussion) after placing an advertisement in the weekly music newspaper Melody Maker.", "Meanwhile, the bond between Davies and Hodgson had begun weakening. Hodgson mused, \"There's a very deep bond, but it's definitely mostly on a musical level. When there's just the two of us playing together, there's an incredible empathy. His down-to-earth way of writing, which is very rock 'n' roll, balances out my lighter, melodic style.\" Over Supertramp's history, their relationship would be amicable but increasingly distant as their lifestyles and musical inclinations saw less and less overlap. Their songwriting partnership gradually dissolved; though all of Supertramp's songs would continue to be officially credited as \"written by Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson\", most of them were written by Davies or Hodgson individually.", "A worldwide tour followed in 1983, in which the band was joined by two additional musicians on stage, former Alice Cooper and Queen player Fred Mandel (guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Scott Page (sax, guitar, horns, backing vocals), and Hodgson announced he would not be continuing with the band once the tour finished in September 1983. Hodgson has stated that his departure was motivated by a desire to spend more time with his family and make solo recordings and that there were never any real personal or professional problems between him and Davies, as some people thought. It's long been known, however, that Roger Hodgson had considerable problems with the band management, in that Supertramp's principal manager was Sue Davies, Rick Davies' wife, and, over the years, they had had many disagreements concerning the running and direction of the band's career.", "1987's Free as a Bird experimented in heavily synthesised music,Bollenberg, John \"Bobo\" (26 June 2000).

I could be putting down his way of thinking and he could be challenging my way of seeing life [...] Our ways of life are so different, but I love him. That contrast is what makes the world go 'round and what makes Supertramp go 'round.

Written by Rick Davies, the song tells about a person who moves to Los Angeles in hopes of becoming a movie star, but finds it far more difficult than he imagined. He struggles and becomes frustrated, until he ultimately gets his break and becomes \"the talk of the Boulevard\".

Roger Hodgson has said that the song was written to be an equivalent to \"Gone Hollywood\", looking at how Americans live, though he confessed that he had only a limited familiarity with US culture at the time of writing.
