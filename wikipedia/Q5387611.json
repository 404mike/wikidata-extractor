He played for the reserves side for two seasons becoming their top scorer. Towards the end of the 1946\u201347 season he played two matches for the first team side scoring a goal on each occasion. Lincoln decided to offer him a part-time contract but he declined as he wanted to help Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football Association to the final of Northern Counties Championship. It was at the final that he was spotted by Sheffield Wednesday scout Tommy Walker. A meeting with Eric Taylor, the Wednesday manager, was organised and as his contract with Lincoln had lapsed he was signed immediately."]}, {"page": "Eric Taylor", "response": ["Eric Taylor may refer to:", "* Eric Taylor (artist) (1909\u20131999), British artist", "* Eric Taylor (gridiron football) (born 1981), American and Canadian football defensive tackle", "* Eric Taylor (football manager) (1912\u20131974), English football manager", "* Eric Taylor (musician) (1949-2020), American singer and songwriter", "* Eric Taylor (screenwriter) (1897\u20131952), Hollywood screenwriter ", "* Eric Taylor (Friday Night Lights), a character on Friday Night Lights"]}]}}
