He designed, built, and tested early aeroplanes, being the first pilot to take off from the sea in Britain. He flew many missions in World War I, including some of the first ever bombing raids. He won honours from several countries, particularly for his part in the 1914 bombing of a German Zeppelin factory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "SS Tubantia", "response": ["In 1924 the wreck was the subject of a salvage dispute between two sets of salvors, both seeking to recover a reputed \u00a32 million worth of gold coins from it (\u00a3100 million in 2012 prices). This was resolved in the English court decision The Tubantia [1924] P 78, and remains the leading authority under English law as to when a salvor takes possession of a sunken shipwreck. The winning party, war hero Sydney Vincent Sippe, spent three years and \u00a3100,000 trying to access the gold, but abandoned the attempt after concluding that it was too dangerous for divers to recover it."]}, {"page": "List of pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the Royal Aero Club in 1912", "response": ["| Sydney Vincent SippePictures of many pioneer aviators listed here can be seen in Flight "]}, {"page": "List of foreign recipients of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by country", "response": ["* Sydney Vincent Sippe (1914), pilot, raid on German Zeppelin factory in November 1914"]}, {"page": "Sydney Sippe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sydney Vincent Sippe"]}, {"page": "Sidney Sippe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sydney Vincent Sippe"]}, {"page": "Sydney Vincent Sipp\u00e9", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sydney Vincent Sippe"]}, {"page": "Sydney Sipp\u00e9", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sydney Vincent Sippe"]}, {"page": "Sidney Sipp\u00e9", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sydney Vincent Sippe"]}, {"page": "Reginald Marix", "response": ["On 28 September Antwerp came under attack by German heavy guns, and the RNAS aircraft assisted the Belgian defenders by flying artillery spotting missions.

They promptly left the city by truck. Antwerp fell to the Germans the following day. Marix subsequently received a mention in despatches, and on 21 October, Grey, Marix and Collett were awarded the Distinguished Service Order.
