Wodehouse valet character Jeeves (Thank You, Jeeves, 1936) and the kind butler Andrews opposite Shirley Temple in Heidi (1937). In the 1960s, he became well known on American television as an announcer/sidekick to talk show host Merv Griffin, and as the support character Constable Jones in Disney's Mary Poppins.

At the peak of its popularity in the late 1970s, it had more than 800 stores. However, as of June 2021, there is only one Arthur Treacher's location remaining.  The menu offers fried seafood or chicken, accompanied by chips (French fries).", "The chain's namesake is Arthur Treacher (1894\u20131975), an English character actor typecast as \"the perfect butler\" for his performances as Jeeves, as a butler in several Shirley Temple films, and the role of Constable Jones in Walt Disney Productions' Mary Poppins. At the time the chain was founded, Treacher was best known as the announcer and sidekick on the popular The Merv Griffin Show. Treacher refused in interviews to confirm whether he had a financial involvement in the restaurants. Regardless, he \"served as a spokesman for the restaurant chain in its early years, underscoring the British character of its food.\"Arthur Treacher's Restaurant Chain Food Chips Fish Butler   He would sometimes visit the restaurants in a red double-decker bus.

Long John Silver's, Captain D's, Skipper's and Alfie's Fish & Chips likewise employed the fish franchise concept about the same time.

Mrs. Paul's responded by replacing the Icelandic cod in Arthur Treacher's recipe with less expensive pollock. The move exacerbated tensions with franchisees \u2013 some of whom had already withheld a total of $5 million in royalties for what they perceived to be a steadily declining level of service. Litigation arising from the conflict eventually reached the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.", "After losing the case to the franchisees and having no way to compensate them, Mrs. Paul's sold Arthur Treacher's to Lumara Foods of America Inc. in March 1982. Lumara Foods filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code four months later.", "In the mid-1980s, franchises in Detroit, Michigan were converted by their owner to a new chain called Seafood Bay.
