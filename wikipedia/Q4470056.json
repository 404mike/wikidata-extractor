Wilson was a famed British Regency courtesan who became the mistress of William, Lord Craven, at the age of 15. Later in her career, she went on to have formal relationship arrangements with Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, and other significant politicians.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington", "response": ["Perhaps because of his unhappy marriage, Wellington came to enjoy the company of a variety of intellectual and attractive women and had many amorous liaisons, particularly after the Battle of Waterloo and his subsequent ambassadorial position in Paris. In the days following Waterloo he had an affair with the notorious Lady Caroline Lamb, sister of one of his severely wounded officers and favourites, Col Frederick Ponsonby. He corresponded for many years with Lady Georgiana Lennox, later Lady de Ros, 26 years his junior and daughter of the Duchess of Richmond (who held the famous ball on the eve of Waterloo) and, though there are hints, it has not been clearly determined if the relationship was ever sexual.  The British press lampooned the amorous side of the national hero. In 1824, one liaison came back to haunt him, when Wellington received a letter from a publisher, John Joseph Stockdale offering to refrain from issuing an edition of the rather racy memoirs of one of his mistresses Harriette Wilson, in exchange for money. It is said that the Duke promptly returned the letter, after scrawling across it, \"Publish and be damned\". However, Hibbert notes in his biography that the letter can be found among the Duke's papers, with nothing written on it.Hibbert (1997), p. 389. It is certain that Wellington did reply, and the tone of a further letter from the publisher, quoted by Longford, suggests that he had refused in the strongest language to submit to blackmail.Longford (1971), pp. 211\u20132."]}, {"page": "Courtesan", "response": ["* Harriette Wilson (1786\u20131846), British courtesan"]}, {"page": "1846 in literature", "response": ["*March 10 \u2013 Harriette Wilson, English memoirist (born 1786)"]}, {"page": "1825 in literature", "response": ["*Harriette Wilson \u2013 The Memoirs of Harriette Wilson, Written by Herself"]}, {"page": "Somers Town, London", "response": ["* Harriette Wilson (1786\u20131845), prominent Regency era courtesan, lived in Duke's Row (now Duke's Road)"]}, {"page": "Darby and Joan", "response": ["A reference to Darby and Joan appears in The Memoirs of Harriette Wilson (1825), the well-known courtesan whom the Duke of Wellington famously told to \"publish and be damned!\" Speaking of her tempestuous love\u2013hate relationship with the \"little sugar baker\" Richard Meyler, she writes wryly:"]}, {"page": "The Three Graces", "response": ["* The Three Graces, the three late eighteenth/early nineteenth century London courtesans Harriette Wilson, her sister Amy Doubochet, and Julia Johnstone."]}, {"page": "Earl of Craven", "response": ["His eldest son, the seventh Baron and first Earl, was a Major-General in the Army, and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire.

Negus is also referred to in Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb, when Jane drinks it on arrival at Thornfield Hall. Jane Austen mentions it as part of the fare at a ball in Mansfield Park. In Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb, Catherine is given it at Thrushcross Grange by the Lintons; it appears in several works by Charles Dickens, namely Sketches by Boz, The Pickwick Papers, A Christmas Carol (during the party at Fezziwig's), Dombey and Son, David Copperfield, Our Mutual Friend and Bleak House; in Harriette Wilson's Memoirs and Grace Dalrymple Elliott's Journal of My Life During the French Revolution; and in John Buchan's Midwinter. Anthony Trollope in The Small House at Allington portrays the rustic Earl de Guest's violent disgust at the thought of the drink. Negus makes a number of appearances as a tonic in The Forsyte Saga by John Galsworthy and in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels and a similar reference is made in Written in My Own Heart's Blood by Diana Gabaldon. In Death Comes to Pemberley by P.D. James, it is said to be added to a white soup. Arthur Conan Doyle has John give some negus to his sister Esther to quiet her in chapter 5 of The Mystery of Cloomber, and in A Death in the Small Hours by Charles Finch, the character Frederick Ponsonby claims that a glass of hot negus \"settles the stomach wonderfully\". In William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair, Ensign Stubble \"never took his eyes off her except when the negus came in\".

Other possible models for the Sharp character have been suggested as Mary Anne Clarke and Harriette Wilson, two of the most well known English courtesans of the Regency era.  Clarke was originally Mistress of the Regent's brother, the Duke of York, and in 1809 had been at the centre of a scandal in which she acknowledged selling officers' commissions with the duke's knowledge, who\u2014being Commander-in-chief\u2014subsequently resigned. Clarke attempted to publish her memoirs on the matter; they were suppressed, but she received a \u00a310,000 payment and an annuity from the King. Harriette Wilson\u2014described by Walter Scott as having \"lived with half the gay world at hack and manger\"\u2014also published her memoirs. She too had profited from her liaisons with important society men, and had become mistress to the Earl of Craven at the age of 15; her memoirs went through over 30 editions in their year of publication. Says Frazee, \"these two most celebrated courtesans of the Regency provided Thackeray with material which, when added to that he acquired from first-hand knowledge of women like Becky and from his reading of fiction\" enabled him to create a realistic Regency courtesan in Sharp."]}, {"page": "George Coventry, 8th Earl of Coventry", "response": ["On 16 January 1808, Lord Coventry married the Hon.
