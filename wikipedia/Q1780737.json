He managed Denmark before moving on to Huddersfield Town, where he managed during the Second World War, and Derby County, where he won a double of the Football League North and Midlands Cup in the 1944\u201345 season.\nMagner was asked to coach the Denmark national football team for the 50th anniversary tournament of the Danish Football Association in 1939. He was seen as possessing a great natural authority, and he introduced a focus on physical conditioning unknown to the then strictly amateur-only Danish football. Magner managed Denmark for the two games at the tournament, as Denmark won against both Finland and Norway.", "link_mentions": {}}}
