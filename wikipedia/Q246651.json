Di Canio said of his ban, \"I made a mistake and I'm sorry, West Ham have given me a big chance and I'm very happy\" He scored his first goal for West Ham on 27 February 1999 in his fourth game.

He made his Premier League debut for the club when he replaced Tim Sherwood in a 3\u20130 victory over Wimbledon F.C. in February 1994. Morrison started, and almost scored, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup. He subsequently replaced Kevin Moran in a 1\u20130 defeat to Arsenal (in which Paul Merson scored the winner) and David Batty in a 3\u20131 defeat to Southampton (in which Stuart Ripley scored Blackburn's goal). Morrison started for Blackburn in a 2\u20131 victory against West Ham United (in which Henning Berg and Ian Pearce scored Blackburn's goals) in April 1994. His last game for Blackburn was a 2\u20131 defeat to Coventry City, in May 1994, which ended Blackburn's title hopes that season. Morrison was given a 'torrid time' by Peter Ndlovu in the game and later claimed that Ndlovu had ruined his career with Blackburn. Morrison also played for Blackburn's reserve team, alongside Shay Given and former Plymouth teammate Nicky Marker. Morrison played in the reserve team defeat against Manchester United's reserve team, which featured Bryan Robson and Dion Dublin, in which Marker's tackle on Ben Thornley led to the latter being sidelined for over a year and ultimately to legal action. Morrison was unable to break into the Rovers side on a regular basis, as he faced competition from Colin Hendry, Henning Berg and Ian Pearce. Morrison began the 1994\u201395 season as a member of the Blackburn squad that went on to win the Premier League that season. He was an unused substitute in the 1994 FA Charity Shield in which Blackburn were beaten 2\u20130 by Manchester United after goals from Eric Cantona and Paul Ince. In December 1994 Morrison was bought by Sam Allardyce for Blackpool. The transfer fee was \u00a3245,000, which was then a Blackpool club-record.

Hartson and Kitson gave the team an exciting frontline, whilst in the midfield Redknapp added Eyal Berkovic from Southampton and Trevor Sinclair and Andy Impey from Queens Park Rangers. The team had to contend with the season-long loss of captain Julian Dicks, who had played on the previous year despite needing urgent knee surgery, the sale of Marc Rieper to Celtic and the sale of Slaven Bili\u0107 to Everton. The profit from the sale went to acquire former England under-21s David Unsworth and Ian Pearce from Everton and Blackburn respectively.", "The 2000\u201301 season was Redknapp's final year.

The deal was later criticised \u2013 the fee was not paid upfront and sell-on bonus was not included, meaning the club missed out on his later \u00a330\u00a0million move to Manchester United and also a sizeable chunk of the initial transfer.", "The team saw over 15 new players brought in on both short- and long-term deals, including Rob Lee, David Connolly, Marlon Harewood, Matthew Etherington, Kevin Horlock, Hayden Mullins, Nigel Reo-Coker, Andy Melville, Bobby Zamora and Brian Deane. The turnover of players continued, however, with these and other acquisitions funded by the loss of David James, Jermain Defoe and Ian Pearce. The squad was bolstered with a contingent of loan signings such as Wayne Quinn, Neil Mellor, Matthew Kilgallon, Niclas Alexandersson, Robbie Stockdale and Jon Harley. As a result, the team routinely lacked cohesion and without Defoe for a large part lacked a quality striker in front of goal \u2013 though Connolly's immediate impact (five in the nine opening league games) and positive attitude coupled with Harewood's form went some way to make up for the loss of the future England international."]}, {"page": "1993 FIFA World Youth Championship", "response": ["* Ian Pearce"]}, {"page": "1998 FA Cup Final", "response": ["In the fifth round Arsenal faced Crystal Palace at home, but once again had to settle for a replay as the team were held to a draw.
