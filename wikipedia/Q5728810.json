They were John Hulme who took over 550 wickets for Derbyshre and Bill Storer who was one of the club's long-serving wicket-keepers.  Harry Bagshaw who also made his debut gave the club many years service. Other players who made their debut were George Ratcliffe, Joseph Marshall,  Henry Street and William Walton. None of these had the chance to play first class cricket for Derbyshire again although some appeared occasionally for the club in the intervening years."]}]}}
