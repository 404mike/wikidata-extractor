While spasticity surely existed before that point, Little was the first person to medically record the condition in writing. Thus, for many years, spastic diplegia was known as Little's Disease; only later did the name change. Also, Little founded the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital of London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sigmund Freud", "response": ["Freud was also an early researcher in the field of cerebral palsy, which was then known as \"cerebral paralysis\". He published several medical papers on the topic and showed that the disease existed long before other researchers of the period began to notice and study it. He also suggested that William John Little, the man who first identified cerebral palsy, was wrong about lack of oxygen during birth being a cause. Instead, he suggested that complications in birth were only a symptom."]}, {"page": "Cerebral palsy", "response": ["Cerebral palsy is the most common movement disorder in children. It occurs in about 2.1 per 1,000 live births. Cerebral palsy has been documented throughout history, with the first known descriptions occurring in the work of Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE. Extensive study of the condition began in the 19th century by William John Little, after whom spastic diplegia was called \"Little's disease\". William Osler first named it \"cerebral palsy\" from the German  (cerebral child-paralysis). A number of potential treatments are being examined, including stem cell therapy. However, more research is required to determine if it is effective and safe.", "The modern understanding of CP as resulting from problems within the brain began in the early decades of the 1800s with a number of publications on brain abnormalities by Johann Christian Reil, Claude Fran\u00e7ois Lallemand and Philippe Pinel. Later physicians used this research to connect problems in the brain with specific symptoms. The English surgeon William John Little (18101894) was the first person to study CP extensively. In his doctoral thesis he stated that CP was a result of a problem around the time of birth. He later identified a difficult delivery, a preterm birth and perinatal asphyxia in particular as risk factors. The spastic diplegia form of CP came to be known as Little's disease. At around this time, a German surgeon was also working on cerebral palsy, and distinguished it from polio. In the 1880s British neurologist William Gowers built on Little's work by linking paralysis in newborns to difficult births. He named the problem \"birth palsy\" and classified birth palsies into two types: peripheral and cerebral."]}, {"page": "Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry", "response": ["* William John Little \u2013 Surgeon, pioneer of orthopaedic surgery"]}, {"page": "William Little", "response": ["* William John Little (1810\u20131894), English surgeon who identified cerebral palsy in children"]}, {"page": "John Langdon Down", "response": ["Down entered the Royal London Hospital as a student in 1853.

Little thought was given to brain protection, because cerebral hypoxia during birth was not linked with later neurological problems until William John Little in 1861, and even then this was controversial; Sigmund Freud, for example, famously disagreed, and when scientific studies of neonatal therapeutic hypothermia were begun in the 1950s researchers like Bjorn Westin still reported their work in terms of re-animation rather than neuroprotection. Investigators such as James Miller and Clement Smith carried out clinical observations and careful physiological experiments, but although some babies were conscientiously followed up, they were not mainly concerned with long term neurological outcome."]}, {"page": "Aldersgate Medical School", "response": ["*William John Little"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Queen Mary University of London", "response": ["* William John Little \u2013 British orthopedic surgeon, pioneer of orthopaedic surgery"]}]}}
