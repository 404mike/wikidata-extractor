Under the rules in use at the time, the teams changed ends after each goal, but the Engineers were unable to take advantage of the fact that the sun and wind were now behind them, and the Wanderers players remained dominant. After twenty minutes Alcock put the ball past the Engineers' goalkeeper, William Merriman, but the goal was disallowed because Charles Wollaston had handled the ball. Wanderers continued to exert further pressure on the Engineers' goal and only Merriman's skill was able to prevent them from increasing their lead. One newspaper later described his performance as \"perfect\".Warsop, p. 11. Despite a late rally from the Engineers, Wanderers were able to hold on to their lead and the game ended in a 1\u20130 victory.

At the time, as in cricket, the officials were not permitted to award a goal unless the players appealed for it, thus no goal was given.  It is not recorded why the Oxford players never appealed. The best effort for the Engineers came when Henry Renny-Tailyour's shot struck the goalpost.  Late in the game the \"Sappers\" mounted a series of attacks on the Oxford goal but were unable to score, being repeatedly thwarted by Nepean.
