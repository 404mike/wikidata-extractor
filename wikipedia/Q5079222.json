However, when Kilner joined the club in 1983, John Bond had been appointed manager with Kilner describing him as a \"daunting character\" and that eventually he \"was dreading walking into the football club because of the atmosphere he had created at the time.\" Kilner was a regular at several youth levels for England and played in a 4\u20130 victory over Iceland that qualified the side for the semi-final of the European Youth Championships against West Germany. However, he was distraught when he was told that Bond planned to withdraw him from the squad due to his disapproval of the training methods of the team's manager Charles Hughes. Bond later relented on the condition that Kilner was available to play in a fixture against Manchester United, during which he suffered a broken leg that ruled him out for five months but also led to severe complications later in his career."]}, {"page": "John Cartwright (footballer)", "response": ["After another spell in Kuwait, he became technical director at the Football Association's National School of Excellence, Lilleshall.
