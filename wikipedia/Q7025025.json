He received his Ph.D. in economics as a Fulbright Scholar from the University of California, Berkeley and his MSc in economics from LSE. According to his LSE biography, he has worked for the World Bank, \"from 1990 to 1992 working on the design of income transfers and health finance in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia, and in 1995\u201396 as a principal author of the World Bank's World Development Report 1996: From Plan to Market.\" He also served as an advisor to the British, Chinese and South African governments.Since 1987, he has published four editions of his series, Economics of the welfare state, the last published in 2012, of which was published in 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Income", "response": ["\"Full income\" refers to the accumulation of both the monetary and the non-monetary consumption-ability of any given entity, such as a person or a household. According to what the economist Nicholas Barr describes as the \"classical definition of income\" (the 1938 Haig\u2013Simons definition): \"income may be defined as the... sum of (1) the market value of rights exercised in consumption and (2) the change in the value of the store of property rights...\" Since the consumption potential of non-monetary goods, such as leisure, cannot be measured, monetary income may be thought of as a proxy for full income. As such, however, it is criticized for being unreliable, i.e. failing to accurately reflect affluence (and thus the consumption opportunities) of any given agent. It omits the utility a person may derive from non-monetary income and, on a macroeconomic level, fails to accurately chart social welfare. According to Barr, \"in practice money income as a proportion of total income varies widely and unsystematically. Non-observability of full-income prevent a complete characterization of the individual opportunity set, forcing us to use the unreliable yardstick of money income."]}, {"page": "Graduate tax", "response": ["Economist Nicholas Barr argued that a \"pure\" graduate tax system would suffer from what he called the \"Mick Jagger\" problem: some higher earners who had attended university would in theory end up effectively financing a large part of the system, creating incentives to emigrate and risking the stability of the system. Similarly, former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable referred to problems over emigration when he ultimately rejected a \"pure\" graduate tax in 2010 during the Browne Review into higher education.http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/39688/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-A_properly_designed_graduate_contribution_could_work_well_for_UK_students_and_higher_education__even_.pdf ", "Nicholas Barr, professor of public economics at the London School of Economics has praised the current system of student loans as a method of financing higher education, arguing that variable fees foster competition that is of benefit to both students and employers."]}, {"page": "Barr, Nicholas", "response": ["#redirectNicholas Barr"]}, {"page": "Nick Barr", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas Barr"]}]}}
