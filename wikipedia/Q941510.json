But if people got to hear it, if even 20% liked it, I would be really happy with that.\" He once approached a major record label and was told by its producer that his music was \"completely directionless,\" and how he did not approve of anything Holdsworth had ever done since he started making his own albums. Guthrie Govan has said of guitarists who aspire to play like Holdsworth: \"I think it's potentially dangerous when a rock type player hears a bit of Allan Holdsworth or Frank Gambale and then dives straight into that style of playing; not only is the technical aspect daunting, there's also all that musical knowledge and understanding going on behind the scenes, and it's really hard to absorb both of those aspects at once without your playing just starting to sound worse.\"Edwards, Owen (30 August 2006). \"Guthrie Govan Interview \u2013 The Virtuoso's Virtuoso\".

It is thought that Holdsworth's incentive behind this approach was to achieve a greater level of legato, similar to other jazz fusion guitarists such as David Fiuczynski and Guthrie Govan, and in some albums and live performances by guitar virtuoso Steve Vai. Holdsworth instead achieved this with use of the vibrato bar, by artificially adjusting the pitch while changing notes to achieve the desired fretless legato sound. This is also a technique by which Holdsworth was inspired by saxophonists, with large scoops in and out of phrases causing a jointed and smooth saxophone-like sound, without the need of a fretless guitar. With this revelation it is thought he abandoned the idea of the fretless guitar. "]}, {"page": "Steven Wilson", "response": ["Wilson's fourth solo album, Hand. Cannot.
