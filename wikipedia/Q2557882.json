They then moved back into central London, setting fire to more buildings and storming Newgate Prison. The hunt for Flemings continued, and those with Flemish-sounding accents were killed, including the royal adviser, Richard Lyons. In one city ward, the bodies of 40 executed Flemings were piled up in the street, and at the Church of St Martin Vintry, popular with the Flemish, 35 of the community were killed.;  Historian Rodney Hilton argues that these attacks may have been coordinated by the weavers' guilds of London, who were commercial competitors of the Flemish weavers.", "The rural rebels came from a wide range of backgrounds, but typically they were, as the historian Christopher Dyer describes, \"people well below the ranks of the gentry, but who mainly held some land and goods\", and not the very poorest in society, who formed a minority of the rebel movement.; ;  Many had held positions of authority in local village governance, and these seem to have provided leadership to the revolt. Some were artisans, including, as the historian Rodney Hilton lists, \"carpenters, sawyers, masons, cobblers, tailors, weavers, fullers, glovers, hosiers, skinners, bakers, butchers, innkeepers, cooks and a lime-burner\". They were predominantly male, but with some women in their ranks. The rebels were typically illiterate; only between 5 and 15 per cent of England could read during this period. They also came from a broad range of local communities, including at least 330 south-eastern villages."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Rodney Hilton (1916\u20132002), late medieval period"]}, {"page": "List of Balliol College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Rodney Hilton"]}, {"page": "English society", "response": ["The social history of the medieval period was primarily developed by Eileen Power, H.

Indeed, these revolts were often accompanied by landless knights, excommunicated clerics and other members of society who might find gain or have reason to rebel. Although these were popular revolts, they were often organized and led by people who would not have considered themselves peasants."]}, {"page": "Past & Present (journal)", "response": ["Past & Present thus emerged in 1952 as an alternative to mainstream political history journals. It was founded by a combination of Marxist and non-Marxist historians, including John Morris. The Marxist historians included members of the Communist Party Historians Group, including E. P. Thompson, Christopher Hill, Eric Hobsbawm, Raphael Samuel, Rodney Hilton, and Dona Torr. The journal previously had the subtitled A Journal of Scientific History. These figures often advocated History from Below in explaining the history of class, labour, and social relations."]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*7 June \u2013 Rodney Hilton, historian (born 1916)"]}, {"page": "Victor Kiernan", "response": ["Kiernan made immense contributions to the post-war flowering of British Marxist historiography that transformed the understanding of social history. Seeking escape paths from a congealing Stalinism, this intellectual movement grew from several figures among them - E.P. Thompson, Christopher Hill, Rodney Hilton, Kiernan and Eric Hobsbawm. Brash and confident in wielding the best of the British Left's cultural arsenal, they welcomed open-ended dialogue with non-Marxist traditions.  Some of this dialogue was on display in the journal Past & Present, a journal of social history that became the most prestigious in the English-speaking world."]}, {"page": "1916 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 17 November \u2013 Rodney Hilton, historian (died 2002)"]}, {"page": "Christopher Dyer", "response": ["Educated at the University of Birmingham where he studied under Rodney Hilton, Dyer has taught at the Universities of Birmingham and Edinburgh, where he counted amongst his students the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Gordon Brown.

P. Thompson, Rodney Hilton, Georges Lefebvre, Eugene Genovese, Isaac Deutscher, C. L. R. James, Timothy Mason, Herbert Aptheker, Arno J. Mayer and Christopher Hill have sought to validate Karl Marx's theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as Fran\u00e7ois Furet, Richard Pipes, J. C. D. Clark, Roland Mousnier, Henry Ashby Turner and Robert Conquest have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. Feminist historians such as Joan Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela Bock, Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book In Defence of History, Richard J. Evans defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle's 1994 book, The Killing of History."]}, {"page": "England in the Late Middle Ages", "response": ["Rodney Hilton and other scholars have argued that those peasants who survived famine, plague and disease, found their situation to be much improved. The period 1350-1450 was for them a golden age of prosperity and new opportunities. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited. As population growth resumed, however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine."]}, {"page": "Peter Coss", "response": ["Peter R. Coss is a British historian, specialising in the history of the English medieval gentry. He is Emeritus Professor of Medieval History at the School of History, Archaeology, and Religion at Cardiff University, Wales. His research interests also include 12th- to 15th-century English social history and Italian history from the same period, as well as visual history/social display and literature and history. As of 2008, he was working on a comparative project between the English gentry and the nobility of Tuscany, and another on the foundations of gentry culture. Coss studied under Rodney Hilton. He is a member of the historical journal Past & Present, and also a former member of the council of the Royal Historical Society."]}, {"page": "The Origin of Capitalism", "response": ["In part I, Wood surveys past work on the transition to capitalism. She sketches how Adam Smith, Max Weber, Fernand Braudel, and Henri Pirenne assumed that capitalism naturally arises from trade, commerce, and urbanisation once city-dwellers have accumulated enough primitive capital to be able to reinvest it in production. However, she also finds that even commentators who were critical of this account tend to argue that the transition to capitalism entailed farmers seizing new opportunities to switch from subsistence to commodity production as the constraints of feudalism were loosened. Examples include Karl Marx himself, Karl Polanyi, Paul Sweezy, Maurice Dobb, Rodney Hilton, and Perry Anderson. This suggests that capitalism is a natural and inevitable behaviour, waiting for its opportunity, rather than historically unusual and specific. Building particularly on the arguments made in the Brenner Debate and on the work of E.\u00a0P. Thompson, Wood argues that 'we need a form of history that brings this specificity into sharp relief'.2002, p. 69."]}, {"page": "Economy of England in the Middle Ages", "response": ["A Marxist critique of Postan emerged from the 1950s onwards, captured in the academic journal Past & Present.Coss, p. 86. This school of thought agreed that the agrarian economy was central to medieval England, but argued that agrarian issues had less to do with demography than with the mode of production and feudal class relations.Dyer 2009, p. 5; Langdon, Astill and Myrdal, p. 1. In this model the English economy entered the crisis of the early 14th century because of the struggles between landlords and peasant for resources and excessive extraction of rents by the nobility. Similar issues underpinned the Peasants Revolt of 1381 and later tax rebellions. Historians such as Frank Stenton developed the \"honour\" as a unit of economic analysis and a focus for understanding feudal relations in peasant communities; Rodney Hilton developed the idea of the rise of the gentry as a key feature for understanding the late medieval period.Crouch, p. 181; Coss, p. 81."]}, {"page": "Marxist schools of thought", "response": ["The British Marxist historians were a circle of scholars that originated in the Communist Party of Great Britain in the 1930s, eventually forming the Communist Party Historians Group in 1946.

Morton, Rodney Hilton, E. P. Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm, George Rud\u00e9, Christopher Hill, Dorothy Thompson, John Saville, Victor Kiernan and Raphael Samuel."]}]}}
