He was born in London in 1980.\nLawrence Pearce attended the world renowned Chelsea College of Art and Design, now known as the University of the Arts London (UAL), before completing 3 years at film school. Within 5 months of graduating, he was offered a Director's position at Wideboys Film and Television, a London post-production facility. Clients included Sony, CNN, The National Geographic, Uri Geller Enterprises, and BBC World/News, among others.\nPearce departed to direct several well-received documentaries and television shows including Acting Up!, Between the Covers (presented-led book program with Simon Cowell's brother Tony), indie music videos and short films. His last two short films were screened at several International festivals and were both broadcast regularly on Sky.\nPearce then wrote, executive produced and directed the micro-budget horror Night Junkies, which starred Katia Winter (Sleepy Hollow, Fox series) and was distributed by Allumination and Content Media, now known as Kew Media, worldwide on DVD and digital in 2007. It became a divisive underground hit with cult audiences. Thereafter, Lawrence pursued business in other industries over a 10-year departure from the film industry.\nIn 2017 he returned to film as a matured screenwriter and executive producer, with several projects in development. He sold Drone (science fiction movie) to Yale Productions for a $15 million budgeted production set for 2020. Other projects in development are Lost Inside (psychological ghost thriller), Alpha (action science fiction) and Cain's Awakening (action/thriller).\nPearce has written two novels, The Haunted Hikikomori in 2013 and Need Love in 2014. He also wrote a graphic novel titled Cain's Awakening (working with Brodie's Law and 2000 AD artist David Bircham), which has since been adapted into another feature film screenplay and project in development.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Beanos", "response": ["Beanos provided 8,000 records for the 2009 film The Boat That RockedTobin, Olivia: 13 lost icons of Croydon, from Beanos to Allders, MyLondon, 23 April 2019. and was the filming location for Lawrence Pearce's comedy film Mixed Up."]}, {"page": "Pearce (surname)", "response": ["*Lawrence Pearce (born 1980), English film writer and director"]}, {"page": "Zara Dawson", "response": ["She appeared in the Nicholas Winter feature film Breathe, released in 2009British Film Magazine , 26 November 2007, Retrieved 5 January 2008 and is currently filming a new British comedy feature film Mixed Up playing the daughter of Billy Murray and starring alongside Adele Silva, Lee Otway, Abi Titmuss and Sylvester McCoy, due for release in 2009, directed by Lawrence Pearce.Credits at the Internet Movie Database, Retrieved 15 May 2008 Zara will start filming feature film Turnout in August 2010 with Ophelia Lovibond, Frank Harper, Neil Maskell and Ben Drew."]}, {"page": "Lawrence pearce", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lawrence Pearce "]}, {"page": "Sasha Jackson", "response": ["Feature film roles include the lead in the direct-to-DVD production Blue Crush 2 as American teenager Dana.
