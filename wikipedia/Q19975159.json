He was born in Cape Town, South Africa and died at Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, England. \nRudd was the son of Charles Dunell Rudd, the associate of Cecil Rhodes and an extremely wealthy prospector and entrepreneur whose business fortune had dubiously legal foundations in pre-colonial South Africa. Charles John Lockhart Rudd, known as Jack, was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He had some success in cricket at Harrow as a left-handed tail-end batsman and a left-handed fast bowler, taking seven wickets in the Eton v Harrow match of 1892. But at Cambridge University he was given only a single match, again batted at the tail-end, and failed to take a wicket in his six expensive overs. He did not play again.\nRudd graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1895; the directory of Cambridge alumni does not record any profession for him.", "link_mentions": {}}}
