After serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, Boyd signed for Second Division club Plymouth Argyle, where he spent two seasons playing as an inside forward. When he began playing as a wing half, a position to which he was better suited, he attracted attention, and soon secured a transfer to the First Division with Birmingham City for what was for Plymouth a record fee.\nThough his club was soon relegated, Boyd established himself in the first team and was appointed captain. He was chosen to represent England at \"B\" international level. An industrious, dynamic player, described by his goalkeeper Gil Merrick as \"a good player and a bloody good captain\", Boyd led the team to the championship of the Second Division in the 1954\u201355 season and to the FA Cup Final and sixth place in the league, still, as of 2018, Birmingham's record league placing, the following year. He played only once more for Birmingham, forced to retire by the back injury which had disrupted his final season with the club.", "link_mentions": {}}}
