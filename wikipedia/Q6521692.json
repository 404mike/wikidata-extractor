After serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, Boyd signed for Second Division club Plymouth Argyle, where he spent two seasons playing as an inside forward. When he began playing as a wing half, a position to which he was better suited, he attracted attention, and soon secured a transfer to the First Division with Birmingham City for what was for Plymouth a record fee.\nThough his club was soon relegated, Boyd established himself in the first team and was appointed captain. He was chosen to represent England at \"B\" international level. An industrious, dynamic player, described by his goalkeeper Gil Merrick as \"a good player and a bloody good captain\", Boyd led the team to the championship of the Second Division in the 1954\u201355 season and to the FA Cup Final and sixth place in the league, still, as of 2018, Birmingham's record league placing, the following year. He played only once more for Birmingham, forced to retire by the back injury which had disrupted his final season with the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2007\u201308 in English football", "response": ["*14 February 2008 \u2013 Len Boyd, 84, former Plymouth Argyle, Birmingham City and England B wing half.

Manchester City were appearing in the final for the sixth time, and for the second consecutive year. They had won the cup twice previously (in 1904 and 1934), and had been beaten in the final three times (in 1926, 1933 and 1955). Though Birmingham had less pedigree in the competition, the press viewed them as favourites.  The Daily Telegraph contrasted Birmingham's \"dazzling Cup run\" with the manner in which Manchester City \"scraped through\", describing the Midlanders as \"firm favourites\". Interviews with players were typically bullish in tone. Manchester City's Bobby Johnstone opined that \"Even an unbiased fan must regard Manchester City with favour\", whereas Birmingham's Len Boyd gauged opinion quite differently: \"They say Birmingham City are the hottest Cup favourites since Wolves crashed to Portsmouth in 1939\".", "Birmingham also had doubts over their selection.

Fellow wing half Roy Warhurst had injured his thigh in the sixth-round match and played no further part in the season, while Badham, who damaged an ankle three weeks before the final, travelled on the Thursday with the rest of the team to their base in Twyford, Berkshire. Jeff Hall was struggling with a virus.Matthews, The Legends of Birmingham City, p.\u00a077. When manager Turner announced his team on the eve of the match, Boyd took Warhurst's position at left-half, Badham, who had proved an able deputy in the semi-final, was omitted, and the inexperienced 22-year-old Johnny Newman came in on the right.Matthews, Complete Record, p.\u00a0114.", "|Half back ||6||Len Boyd", "An estimated 10,000 people met the Birmingham City party on their return to Snow Hill station.

Len Boyd addressed the crowds from the balcony before the coaches continued through the city centre and back to St Andrew's, Birmingham City's home ground. The following Wednesday, a dinner was held to honour the club's achievements.

They went on to play on the losing side in two successive Inter-Cities Fairs Cup finals, under Smith's captaincy.
