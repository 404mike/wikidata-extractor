Named after a song by pianist Cecil Taylor, the program typically featured doo wop, rhythm and blues, and jazz, particularly the free jazz developed in the mid-1950s. Reed said that when he started out he was inspired by such musicians as Ornette Coleman, who had \"always been a great influence\" on him; he said that his guitar on \"European Son\" was his way of trying to imitate the jazz saxophonist. Reed's sister said that during her brother's time at Syracuse, the university authorities had tried unsuccessfully to expel him because they did not approve of his extracurricular activities. At Syracuse University, he studied under poet Delmore Schwartz, who he said was \"the first great person I ever met\", and they became friends.

Described by Rolling Stone as the \"tubular groaning of a galactic refrigerator\", many critics interpreted it as a gesture of contempt, an attempt to break his contract with RCA or to alienate his less sophisticated fans. Reed claimed that the album was a genuine artistic effort inspired by the drone music of La Monte Young,Alan Licht, Common Tones: Selected Interviews with Artists and Musicians 1995-2020, Blank Forms Edition, Interview with Lou Reed, pp.155-172 and suggesting that quotations of classical music could be found buried in the feedback, but he also said, \"Well, anyone who gets to side four is dumber than I am.\" Lester Bangs declared it \"genius\", though also psychologically disturbing.
