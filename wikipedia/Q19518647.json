Adapted and directed by Bryan Forbes (Newman's husband), this \"romance in wheelchairs\" was considered unusual in its time owing in part to the sexual nature of the relationship between McDowell and Newman, who play disabled people. The film received two Golden Globe nominations, for Best Foreign Film (English Language), and Best Song for \"Long Ago Tomorrow\".", "It was based on a novel by Peter Marshall, who contracted polio when he was eighteen and lived the rest of his life in a wheelchair. (He died of pneumonia in 1972.) The novel was originally published in 1964.\"A Long Island Electra: New Novels\", Coleman, John, The Observer, 28 June 1964: 25. Kirkus Reviews called it \"a short novel, written with a sharpness of intelligence and feeling, and it is altogether genuine, a word easily exploited and seldom justified.\" The New York Times called it a \"fine, moving novel.\"\"Reader's Report\" by Martin Levin, The New York Times, 17 April 1966: 319. In 1965 director Robert Butler bought the screen rights to it and another Marshall novel, Two Lives.\"Randall Is Morocco-Bound\", Los Angeles Times, 18 September 1965: b8."]}]}}
