Former ALP staffer Tim Soutphommasane and progressive activist Marc Stears criticised the government's management of the vaccine rollout in June 2021, saying it will likely be \"taught as a case study of public policy failure\". During a press conference in July, Morrison issued an apology for the slow vaccine rollout. In August, Morrison declared that the government's problems with the rollout had been \"overcome\", despite several states having a shortage of vaccines. To describe Australia's prolonged vaccination rollout, trade unionist Sally McManus coined the term \"strollout\", with the phrase being named as the country's word of the year by Macquarie Dictionary."]}, {"page": "Tangled Up in Blue (book)", "response": ["Davis relates that the five key people leading the seminars were Glasman himself and four other academics who are all to various degrees also active as political strategists.

However, she is thought to have been a greater influence on the political development of her sons. \"There's no doubt that Ed got a lot of his drive from Marion and a lot of his feel for nitty-gritty grassroots politics from Marion too,\" according to Dr. Marc Stears, politics fellow at the University of Oxford. Friends have stated that the contest between the brothers has been a huge \"strain\" for their mother and that she has even told people it would have been much easier had they simply become academics rather than politicians. She was reported as \"maintain[ing] a low profile\" in 2010 when Ed Miliband defeated David Miliband to become leader of the Opposition in the United Kingdom. "]}]}}
