When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson.\" Olivier's concern with speaking naturally and avoiding what he called \"singing\" Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, as critics regularly decried his delivery."]}, {"page": "William Hartnell", "response": ["Hartnell entered the theatre in 1925 working under Frank Benson as a general stagehand.\"Obituary: Mr William Hartnell\u00a0\u2013 An actor of varied talents\", The Times, 25 April 1975.
