It represents a peak in the editorial style of drawing on both quarto versions, particularly the 1604 quarto, and also the Folio of 1623, in order to create a single text. He wrote two monographs on Henry Chettle and Edward Benlowes, and he published editions of Elizabethan plays and numerous scholarly articles.\nHis long collaboration with the Arden Shakespeare started in the 1950s, with the commission to edit Hamlet. In 1958 he was named joint general editor of the series (along with Harold Brooks). In this capacity he worked with some of the most distinguished Shakespearean scholars of his time.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
