It represents a peak in the editorial style of drawing on both quarto versions, particularly the 1604 quarto, and also the Folio of 1623, in order to create a single text. He wrote two monographs on Henry Chettle and Edward Benlowes, and he published editions of Elizabethan plays and numerous scholarly articles.\nHis long collaboration with the Arden Shakespeare started in the 1950s, with the commission to edit Hamlet. In 1958 he was named joint general editor of the series (along with Harold F. Brooks). In this capacity he worked with some of the most distinguished Shakespearean scholars of his time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hamlet", "response": ["Scholars have often speculated that Hamlets Polonius might have been inspired by William Cecil (Lord Burghley)\u2014Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen Elizabeth\u00a0I. E. K. Chambers suggested Polonius's advice to Laertes may have echoed Burghley's to his son Robert Cecil. John Dover Wilson thought it almost certain that the figure of Polonius caricatured Burghley. A. L. Rowse speculated that Polonius's tedious verbosity might have resembled Burghley's. Lilian Winstanley thought the name Corambis (in the First Quarto) did suggest Cecil and Burghley. Harold Jenkins considers the idea that Polonius might be a caricature of Burghley to be conjecture, perhaps based on the similar role they each played at court, and also on Burghley addressing his Ten Precepts to his son, as in the play Polonius offers \"precepts\" to Laertes, his own son. Jenkins suggests that any personal satire may be found in the name \"Polonius\", which might point to a Polish or Polonian connection. G. R. Hibbard hypothesised that differences in names (Corambis/Polonius:Montano/Raynoldo) between the First Quarto and other editions might reflect a desire not to offend scholars at Oxford University."]}, {"page": "Polonius", "response": ["Polonius was first proposed as a parody of Queen Elizabeth's leading counsellor, Lord Treasurer, and Principal Secretary William Cecil, Lord Burghley in 1869. Israel Gollancz also suggested that Polonius might have been a satire on Burghley. The theory was often finessed with supplementary arguments,See, for example, Lilian Winstanley, Hamlet and the Scottish Succession, 1921, 112; 114\u2013118; John Dover Wilson, The Essential Shakespeare, 1937, 104; Joel Hurstfield, The Queen's Wards, 1958, 257; A.L.

While the exact relationship of the short and apparently primitive text of Q1 to the later published texts is not resolved, Hardin Craig has suggested that it may represent an earlier draft of the play and hence would confirm that the Ur-Hamlet is in fact merely an earlier draft of Shakespeare's play. This view is held in some form or another by Harold Bloom,Bloom, pp. xiii, 383 Peter Alexander,Alexander, Peter vol.4 of The Heritage of Shakespeare: Tragedies, p. 638 and Andrew Cairncross, who stated, \"It may be assumed, until a new case can be shown to the contrary, that Shakespeare's Hamlet and no other is the play mentioned by Nashe in 1589 and Henslowe in 1594\".
