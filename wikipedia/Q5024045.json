This decline was changed by the actions of individuals such as American musicologist Alan Lomax, who collected numerous songs in Scotland that were issued by Columbia Records around 1955. Radio broadcasts by Lomax, Hamish Henderson and Peter Kennedy (1922\u20132006) were also important in raising awareness of the tradition, particularly Kennedy's As I Roved Out, which was largely based around Scottish and Irish music. The School of Scottish Studies was founded at University of Edinburgh in 1951, with Henderson as a research fellow and a collection of songs begun by Calum Maclean (1915\u201360).Sweers, Electric Folk, pp. 256\u20137. Acts that were popularised included  John Strachan (1875\u20131958), Jimmy MacBeath (1894\u20131972), Jeannie Robertson (1908\u201375) and Flora MacNeil (1928-2015).C. MacDougall, Scots: The Language of the People (Black & White, 2006), , p. 246. A number of festivals also popularised the music, such as Edinburgh People's Festival (1951\u201353) and Aberdeen Folk Festival (1963\u2013). In the 1960s there was a flourishing folk club culture. The first folk club was founded in London by Ewan MacColl (1915\u201389), who emerged as a leading figure in the revival in Britain, recording influential records such as Scottish Popular Ballads (1956). Scottish folk clubs were less dogmatic than their English counterparts which rapidly moved to an all English folk song policy, and they continued to encourage a mixture of Scottish, Irish, English and American material. Early on they hosted traditional performers, including Donald Higgins and the Stewarts of Blairgowrie, beside English performers and new Scottish revivalists such as Robin Hall (1936\u201398), Jimmie Macgregor (born 1930) and The Corries. A number of these new performers, including the Ian Campbell Folk Group, emerged from the skiffle movement."]}, {"page": "Hamish Henderson", "response": ["From 1955 to 1987 he was on the staff of the University of Edinburgh's School of Scottish Studies which he co-founded with Calum Maclean: there he contributed to the sound archives that are now available on-line.
