He followed an arts programme as well as Medicine at Edinburgh University. His MD thesis was on hypnotism. He continued his studies at Pavia University. During World War I, Crichton-Miller joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in the rank of lieutenant colonel. His concern for sufferers of Shell shock, led after the war to his founding a charitable clinic in Tavistock Square to treat nervous complaints. He remained its honorary medical director until 1934, followed by a further seven years as its honorary senior physician. By 1939 he was working alongside 90 honorary medical colleagues. ('Honorary' meant that they were working Pro bono.)\nHis first book was on hypnotism and disease and came out in 1912. He became a popular lecturer and writer on the 'New Psychology', which was broadly based on the work of the Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Gustav Jung. A further three books appeared after the war forming a trilogy: 'The New Psychology and the Teacher' (1921), 'The New Psychology and the Parent' (1922), followed by 'The New Psychology and the Preacher' (1924). He became chairman of the medical section of the British Psychological Society and in 1938 President of the Psychiatry section of the Royal Society of Medicine and president of the International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, and vice-president of the C. G. Jung Institute, Z\u00fcrich. The British Medical Association appointed him to the Sir Charles Hastings lectureship.
