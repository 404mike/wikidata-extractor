Already on the first back straight, there was some physical contact in the tightly bunched eight-man field.  Britain's Steve Ovett was boxed in and pushed East Germany's Detlef Wagenknecht, in order to get more room and a tactically better place.  The first 200 metres were run in about 26 seconds, according to the long-time BBC sports journalist David Coleman.  At that point, Brazil's Agberto Guimaraes was leading the race, flanked by Britain's David Warren.  On the first home straight, Ovett again tried to force his way to a better position, elbowing Wagenknecht and the Soviet Union's Nikolay Kirov.  Unofficially the 400-metre split time was 54.55 seconds.  Behind Guimaraes, Warren and Wagenknecht, Kirov and East Germany's Andreas Busse were tied for the fourth place.  Ovett and France's Jos\u00e9 Marajo ran right behind Busse.  The strongest pre-race favourite, and the sole world record holder at 800 metres, 1000 metres and the mile, Britain's Sebastian Coe, was running eighth, and almost touched the third lane's edge.  At or around 430 or 440 metres, Warren suddenly sprinted past Guimaraes.  Kirov rose to the second place, and on the final back straight, Ovett moved to the third place.  With over 200 metres to run, Kirov kicked into the lead, followed closely by Ovett.  Only at this point, Coe began to sprint hard, moving quickly into the fifth place.  On the final bend, Kirov and Ovett were able to maintain their lead over Guimaraes and Coe.  In the final straight's first half, Ovett easily passed Kirov while Coe desperately accelerated towards Guimaraes.  While he managed to pass the Brazilian, Coe lost valuable time and energy, and he was only able to catch one more runner, Kirov, in the final straight's second half.  At the finish line, Ovett was still some three-and-a-half metres ahead of Coe, who finished a disappointed second, just half a metre ahead of the fading Kirov.
