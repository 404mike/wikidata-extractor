Like his contemporary, Sir Percy Hobart, Guderian initially envisioned an armored corps (panzerkorps) composed of several types of tanks. This included a slow infantry tank, armed with a small-caliber cannon and several machine guns. The infantry tank, according to Guderian, was to be heavily armored to defend against enemy anti-tank guns and artillery. He also envisioned a fast breakthrough tank, similar to the British cruiser tank, which was to be armoured against enemy anti-tank weapons and have a large, 75-millimeter (2.95\u00a0in) main gun. Lastly, Germany needed a heavy tank, armed with a 150-millimeter (5.9\u00a0in) cannon to defeat enemy fortifications, and even stronger armor. Such a tank required a weight of 70 to 100\u00a0tonnes and was completely impractical given the manufacturing capabilities of the day.Guderian, Achtung-Panzer!, pp. 169\u201370 for a detailed look into Guderian's theories."]}, {"page": "7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["After the Munich Agreement, the division was formed in Egypt during 1938 as the Mobile Division (Egypt) and its first divisional commander was the tank theorist Major-General Sir Percy Hobart.
