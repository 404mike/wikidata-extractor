In 2018, Brand Finance's research cited the Duchess as the \"Most Powerful Royal Fashion Influencer\", retaining that pieces in her wardrobe increase desirability among 38 percent of American shoppers. The Duchess has been credited for popularizing nude pumps and hosiery in the early years of her marriage. During daytime engagements, she has been noted to favor coatdresses, tea dresses, waxed jackets, lavalli\u00e8re blouses, blazers, and skinny jeans. While Catherine wears items from many new designers, she has also worn dresses by Catherine Walker, who designed many of Diana's favourite evening gowns and day suits. She has worn outfits, hats and ensembles by many other fashion designers. The brands she favours are noted in the media. The Duchess has worn Jenny Packham numerous times, most notably outside the Lindo Wing after giving birth to each of her children in 2013, 2015, and 2018 respectively. Alexander McQueen has been referred to as Catherine's \"go-to\" brand since her wedding in 2011, and she has worn designs to several annual events including Trooping the Colour, Royal Ascot and the British Academy Film Awards, as well as state banquets and receptions. She has worn several high-street brands during official engagements and projects, most frequently Topshop and Zara. Believed to be influenced by the style and fashion choices of Diana, Princess of Wales, Catherine has developed a \"caring wardrobe\" similar to that of her mother-in-law, with colourful fabrics, skirt suits, and bright hues suitable for visiting hospitals and schools."]}, {"page": "Chris Packham", "response": ["Packham spent his early childhood in Hampshire and natural history was his main passion.
