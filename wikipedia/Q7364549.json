He chose to begin his career at Vale rather than Potteries derby rivals Stoke City as he reasoned he had a better chance of breaking into the first team for the lower ranked Vale. He made his debut on Boxing day 1964, in a 3\u20130 defeat to Hull City at Vale Park, having been tasked with marking Ken Wagstaff. At the age of 16 years and 354 days, he became the youngest player in the club's history. He played five games of the 1964\u201365 season, as the \"Valiants\" were relegated out of the Third Division under Jackie Mudie. Boulton scored on the last day of the season, in a 2\u20131 home win over Walsall. This made him the youngest goalscorer in the club's history. He turned professional in August 1965 at the age of 17, and made 20 appearances in 1965\u201366. He became a mainstay of the defence by 1966\u201367, featuring 39 times, scoring three goals. He played 42 games under Stanley Matthews, however he \"gave away two needless penalties\" in a defeat to Portsmouth at Fratton Park in the FA Cup, and The FA also charged the club with paying Boulton and Gordon Logan illegal bonuses. Matthews made him club captain at the age of 18. He remained at the club under new boss Gordon Lee, and made 46 appearances in 1968\u201369. He was then an ever-present in the 52 game 1969\u201370 season, also scoring six goals, as Vale were promoted out of the Fourth Division after securing a fourth-place finish; he played consistently alongside defenders Ron Wilson and Roy Sproson, and goalkeeper Keith Ball. He played 47 games in 1970\u201371, scoring two goals. Sixteen games into the 1971\u201372 season, in November 1971, he was sold on to Torquay United for a fee of \u00a310,000. He played a total of 267 games for Port Vale in all competitions, scoring 12 times."]}, {"page": "Freddie Steele (footballer)", "response": ["Steele returned to Vale Park when he replaced Norman Low as manager in October 1962.

They finished 1962\u201363 third in the Third Division, four points shy of promotion. He spent big for the 1963\u201364 campaign, bringing in Northern Ireland international Billy Bingham from Everton for \u00a315,000; Albert Cheesebrough from Leicester City for another \u00a315,000; as well as Walsall's Tim Rawlings for \u00a34,000 and winger Ron Smith from Crewe Alexandra for \u00a36,500. In mid-season he further splashed out \u00a312,000 for both ex-Scotland striker Jackie Mudie and left-back Ron Wilson, both from Stoke City.

Aspin and Foyle both also went on to manage the club, whilst Grew spent three spells as caretaker-manager. Tom Pope is the only player to win the award three times, winning in 2013, 2014 and 2018. Eamonn O'Keefe and Anthony Griffith represented Ireland and Montserrat respectively at international level, though both players were born in England. Speaking after receiving his first award in April 2013, Tom Pope stated that \"To be voted for by the fans like this is a massive honour for me. It means such a lot, more than the other [PFA] awards I've been lucky enough to win.\" Midfielders are more commonly rewarded, claiming 18 wins."]}]}}
