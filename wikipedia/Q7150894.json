They released their first EP, Jimone, on Factory Records in 1983 and attracted critical enthusiasm as well as the patronage of Morrissey. Sales of their two albums for Blanco y Negro Records, Stutter in 1986 and Strip-mine in 1988, were disappointing; at the time Madchester began, the band was using T-shirt sales to fund its own releases through Rough Trade Records. Madchester helped bring them commercial success and the single \"Sit Down\" became one of the most popular anthems of the era."]}, {"page": "Tim Booth", "response": ["Booth was born in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, and grew up in Clifford, Trafford, Greater Manchester, England in his teenage years. He attended Shrewsbury School. Whilst a student at the University of Manchester studying drama, Booth encountered Jim Glennie, Paul Gilbertson and Gavan Whelan in 1981 in the cellar bar of the university's students' union. Impressed by Booth's distinctive dancing style, Gilbertson invited Booth to join their band as a dancer. Booth accepted the offer, and was soon promoted to lead singer and lyricist of the band James.

Two weeks later they played their first concert at Eccles Royal British Legion club, in which their singer did not show up. Glennie offered himself up to sing instead, and the club manager pulled the plug halfway through their second song, demanding they stopped playing."]}, {"page": "Village Fire", "response": ["*Paul Gilbertson (Jimone) / Larry Gott (James II) - Lead guitar"]}, {"page": "Larry Gott", "response": ["Within the band Gott mainly played guitar and provided backing vocals, but also featured on keyboards and the flute on earlier albums. Prior to joining the band, he had been the guitar tutor for founder members Jim Glennie and Paul Gilbertson. He was later invited to join the band after Gilbertson's playing began to decline due to his drug problems, which eventually led to Gilbertson's sacking.
