She is known internationally for her political and often controversial documentary film work as well as her activism within the global feminism and lesbian rights movements. She has collaborated with many well-known artists and activists, and public figures across the world. Parmar specifically uses the camera to benefit women worldwide. Focusing her lens on disenfranchised communities and peoples internationally, her contribution to worldwide humanitarian rights and education has been crucial. Her films are marked by political complexity and visual richness, taking up the themes of women's strength, racial and cultural oppression and the lives of South Asian LGBT people. She is well known for drawing on humour, wit, women's everyday lives and visionary storytelling to articulate the realities and dreams of feminist, LGBT women and South Asian diasporic life.\nHer works typically center around the themes of gender, identity, LGBT issues, race, feminism, and creativity. Parmar aims to narrate and depict untold stories and experiences of traditionally marginalized and underrepresented groups such as African-American women in the 1970s, survivors of female genital mutilation, and misrepresented gay communities in Southeast Asia.\nIn particular, Parmar's award-winning documentary Warrior Marks (1993), made in collaboration with Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Alice Walker (author of The Color Purple), located Parmar deep within multiple conversations about globalization and women's responsibilities to other women. Parmar went on to co-publish Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women with Walker.\nParmar has also made music videos for Morcheeba, Tori Amos, Ghostlands and Midge Ure.In the fall of 2007, Pratibha Parmar was awarded the Visionary Award by the One in Ten Film Festival for her entire body of work and she is a past winner of the San Francisco Frameline Film Festival Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2016, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alice Walker", "response": ["Beauty in Truth (2013) is a documentary film about Walker directed by Pratibha Parmar."]}, {"page": "New Queer Cinema", "response": ["Susan Hayward states that Queer cinema existed for decades before it was given its official label, such as, with the films of French creators Jean Cocteau (Le sang d'un po\u00e8te in 1934) and Jean Genet (Un chant d'amour in 1950). Queer cinema is associated with avant-garde and underground film (e.g., Andy Warhol's 1960s films). In avant-garde film, there are lesbian filmmakers, who laid the heritage for Queer cinema, notably Ulrike Ottinger, Chantal Akerman and Pratibha Parmar. An important influence on the development of Queer cinema was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1970s and 1980s European art films, which added a \"gay and queer sensibility\" to film (e.g., Querelle from 1982, based on Genet's novel).Hayward, Susan. \"Queer cinema\" in Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 329-333 Like Rosa von Praunheim, who has made more than 100 films on queer topics since the late 1960s, many of them have been shown and rated internationally. Some of the director's films are considered milestones in Queer cinema. Von Praunheim became an international icon of Queer cinema. Another influence on Queer cinema was the Brazilian filmmaker H\u00e9ctor Babenco, whose film Kiss of the Spider Woman, from 1985, depicted a man in prison, who is seduced by his cellmate. His films also examined the relationship between sexual, social, and political oppression, which would go on to become key themes of New Queer Cinema."]}, {"page": "First-wave feminism", "response": ["White women feminists, in this historical context, asserted their superiority over white men and brown women.
