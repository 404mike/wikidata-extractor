As recorded in the preface for the book 'The Children of Craig-Y-Nos', Rowlands was admitted in 1947, as an eight-year-old, to Craig-y-nos TB hospital in Breconshire. He was given a rugby ball as a gift and accidentally kicked it through a glass door, for which he was put in a straitjacket for a week. A teacher by profession, he played club rugby at scrum-half for Abercraf, Pontypool, Llanelli and Swansea. He captained Pontypool in the 1962 \u2013 63 season, and captained Swansea in the 1967\u20131968 season\nUnusually, his first cap for Wales against England in 1963 was as captain, a position which he retained for his next 13 caps between 1963 and 1965, leading Wales to their first Triple Crown victory since 1952. He captained Wales in every game he played including Wales' first match outside of Europe and its first in the Southern Hemisphere; played against East Africa in Nairobi on 12 May 1964, Wales winning 8-26.\nIn the 1963 Five Nations match against Scotland, in wet and muddy conditions, Rowlands decided to kick for touch as many times as possible, with the result that there were 111 line-outs in the match and Wales outside-half David Watkins only touched the ball five times. Wales won 6-0 (including a drop goal from Rowlands, his only international points) but the International Rugby Board eventually responded with a change in the laws in 1970, eliminating the gain in ground for kicks directing into touch from outside the team's own 22.After retiring as a player, Rowlands was coach of the Welsh national team for 29 matches between 1968 and 1974, becoming the youngest person to hold this position. This was a successful period for Wales, including a Grand Slam in 1971 and included the tour of New Zealand in 1969. He was manager of the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia in 1989, managed the British Isles team versus a rest-of-the-world team in 1986, and also managed Wales in the 1987 Rugby World Cup. He was President of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1989.\nAfter recovering from cancer in the 1990s, Rowlands has focused his attention on raising tens of thousands of pounds for cancer charities.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Watkins (rugby)", "response": ["Watkins made his international d\u00e9but in 1963, at the age of 20 for Wales against England partnering Clive Rowlands. He was a key figure in Newport's epic win over Whineray's 1963 New Zealand All Blacks. He was vice captain of Newport under Brian Price in 1963\u201364 and went on to captain them for three seasons 1964\u201365, 1965\u201366 and 1966\u201367. He set the club dropped goal record of 14 in 1966\u201367, in all he scored 228 points including 55 dropped goals for Newport. He never played on the losing side for Newport at sevens.

At half-back, Wales sent John, Edwards, Phil Bennett and Chico Hopkins, but in all three Tests, two against the New Zealand \"All Blacks\" and one against Australia, Welsh coach Clive Rowlands kept faith with John and Edwards.

The party recommended that Welsh clubs accept the principle of coaching.

Following pressure from the Welsh clubs at the WRU's annual general meeting, the decision was reversed and Clive Rowlands was appointed as coach for the tour.
