The project was described as an \"audience-driven story experience\", with anticipated launch in 2016. In March 2016, Sam Barlow announced he has joined Interlude and would be serving as a creative lead in the series, based on his work from his video game, \"Her Story\", which required the player to piece together a mystery based on a series of video clips. Interlude rebranded itself as Eko in December 2016, and the six-episode series was released in March 2018."]}, {"page": "Silent Hill: Origins", "response": ["Issues with the game's engine and \"a confused high-level vision for the game\" led to Climax shutting down their Los Angeles studio, and transferring the game's team to the Climax Action studio in the United Kingdom, to ensure the final product would be \"a tighter, more focused game that will provide fans with the experience they want... a Silent Hill experience\"; the release date was also pushed forward from winter 2006 to Q3/Q4 2007. The version of Origins that the United Kingdom development team received was intended to be a dark comedy inspired by the American television series Scrubs. Konami allowed the team to change the game, provided that the changes were done within the same budget and time frame; Originss script, level design, and monsters were redone within a week by Sam Barlow. For Origins, the developers intentionally replicated aspects of gameplay and atmosphere from the first installment; for example, the monsters behave more aggressively than those in previous installments, as a throwback to the first game. Later previews showed that the game had changed significantly and contained gameplay more in line with that found in the previous titles in the series. The changes were well received by video game journalists. On 19 August 2007, a demo of the game was leaked to internet download sites; Climax promptly denied they were the source of the leaked content."]}, {"page": "Serious Sam: Next Encounter", "response": ["Serious Sam: Next Encounter was developed by Climax Group through its Climax Solent studio. According to lead designer Sam Barlow, the team of around twenty people worked in a positive atmosphere. The development began when Climax Solent received development units of the GameCube and created a game engine for the system. The game, during development called Serious Sam: Word to the Mothership, drew inspiration from several sources: Previous Serious Sam games were used as the base template, the controls were designed to be as responsive and intuitive as those in GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, the enemy wave designs were influenced by Smash TV, and the vehicles were modelled after those in Ikari Warriors. Producer Matt Cooper also cited Contra as an influence. Original enemy designs were created alongside foes also featured in previous Serious Sam games."]}, {"page": "Silent Hill: Shattered Memories", "response": ["Climax Studios began with the game's plot, which the development team considered the main appeal of the series. Early in the game's development, some team members visited a psychiatrist for research. The use of ice as a visual theme originated partly because the developers wanted to create an Otherworld for the game, as previous games in the series had featured the same theme as Silent Hill, and because snowfall is common in the northeastern or midwestern United States, where the fictional town is located. Falling snow was added to limit the player's visibility and build an atmosphere of dread. The developers included a system of psychological profiling that adjusted gameplay elements based on the player's interaction with the game. Writer Sam Barlow explained the system: \"Ultimately every little thing you do in the game or piece of content you can interact with can be assigned a little personality score. This is all added into a very classical psychometric profile of your personality that can then be mapped onto research\". The opening questionnaire has little significance in the player's profile. Capturing the multiple variations of gameplay elements for submission to the Entertainment Software Rating Board proved to be difficult, according to the game's producer, Tomm Hulett. Loading times were eliminated from the game to maintain a sense of immersion for the player."]}, {"page": "Sam Barlow", "response": ["Sam Barlow may refer to:", "* Sam Barlow (rugby league) (born 1985), rugby league player for Halifax R.L.F.C.", "* Sam Barlow (game designer), British video game director and writer", "* Sam Barlow (pioneer) (1795\u20131867), U.S. pioneer toll road builder", "** Sam Barlow High School, Gresham, Oregon, USA", "* Sam Barlow, fictional character from Home and Away, see List of Home and Away characters", "* Sam Barlow Williams (1921\u20132009), U.S. inventor"]}, {"page": "Her Story (video game)", "response": ["Her Story is an interactive film video game written and directed by Sam Barlow. It was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and iOS, and the following year for Android. In the game, the player searches and sorts through a database of video clips from fictional police interviews, and uses the clips to solve the case of a missing man. The police interviews focus on the man's wife, Hannah Smith, portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert.", "Her Story was developed by Sam Barlow, who previously worked on games such as Silent Hill: Origins (2007) and Silent Hill: Shattered Memories (2009) at Climax Studios. Barlow had conceived the idea of a police procedural game while working at Climax Studios, but decided to become independent to create the game, in order to develop a game that is \"deep on story\". He became frustrated by publishers using kitchen sink realism as the reason behind rejecting game pitches, and found that becoming independent allowed him to create his own game of the sort. He also wished to become independent after playing games like Year Walk (2013) and 80 Days (2014). Barlow avoided development until he had an idea that was possible to execute. \"I could probably quite easily have gone and made an exploration horror game ... but I kind of knew that there would be big compromises there because of budget,\" he said. Barlow spent his savings to work on the game, allowing him a year of development time. He followed through with the concept of Her Story, as it focused on an \"intimate setting, dialogue and character interaction\", which he found was often dismissed in larger titles. Barlow felt particularly inspired to develop Her Story after seeing the continuous support of his 1999 game Aisle. When referring to how Her Story challenges typical game conventions, Barlow compares it to the Dogme 95 filmmaking movement, and Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 film Rope."]}, {"page": "International Mobile Gaming Awards", "response": ["In 2016, the competition added a new category for VR games and announced 102 nominations and 11 categories.
