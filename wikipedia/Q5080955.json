He was a lieutenant in the Queen's Own West Kent Yeomanry and a partner in the banking firm of Glyn, Mills & Co.In the 1885 general election, Mills was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the inceptive safe seat of Sevenoaks in which he owned The Wildernesse, setting up community allotments and an orphanage there.  He stood down from the Commons at the 1892 general election.  In 1898 he inherited the title Baron Hillingdon and Hillingdon Court outright.In the same year Hillingdon commissioned Edwin Lutyens, who was then working locally, to design Overstrand Hall. Its work began in 1899 and it was completed by 1901. Nikolaus Pevsner considered it one of Lutyens' most remarkable buildings, but other critics of the day thought it \"lacked the picturesqueness of his best works\".Lord Hillingdon was elected a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in March 1900.Hillingdon was godfather to Harry Elkins Widener, son of George Dunton Widener who both perished on the Titanic\nHe died in April 1919, aged 64, and was succeeded in the barony by his second son Arthur, the MP for Uxbridge, elected unopposed to replace his elder brother. Charles Thomas Mills was killed on the Western Front in France in 1915.  \n\nHillingdon married Alice Marion Harbord, daughter of Charles Harbord, 5th Baron Suffield, in 1886. They were given Overstrand Hall as a wedding present.\nLord Hillingdon's probate was sworn in 1919 at \u00a31,000,000 (equivalent to about \u00a346,300,000 in 2019) as was that of his mother at a little over 5% of that sum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hillingdon", "response": ["Hillingdon Court was built in 1858 by Sir Charles Mills as his family home, after he had bought separate adjacent properties in Vine Lane. Both buildings were demolished and the plots combined to allow the construction of the new property. The mansion remained in the family's ownership until Charles Mills, 2nd Baron Hillingdon died in 1919. Part of the estate was bought by the local authority, while the mansion was bought by the Roman Catholic Order of the Sacred Heart and became a nursing home in 1920. After the Second World War, the mansion became a girls' school, and in 1978 it was bought by ACS International Schools to become ACS Hillingdon. Under the ownership of ACS International Schools, the mansion has been extended and converted in parts to meet the needs of a school. The area of land bought by the local authority remains today as Hillingdon Court Park."]}, {"page": "Charles Harbord, 5th Baron Suffield", "response": ["* Hon.
