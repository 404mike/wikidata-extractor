He was significant as one of the first trainers to run a public stable, rather than being the employee of a wealthy patron. He was based for most of his career at Newmarket, Suffolk.

Kingcraft on the other hand was almost forgotten and started a 20/1 outsider in a field of fifteen. According to a report in The Spectator the weather on Derby day was poor and the crowd smaller than usual. Ridden by Tom French, Kingcraft was saddled away from the main paddock and disappointed the crowd by failing to take part in the parade in front of the stands. The start of the race was delayed for some time by the behaviour of Cockney Boy who refused to line up with the other runners. When the race got under way French restrained Kingcraft at the back of the field in the early stages before making steady progress from half way. Approaching the turn into the straight, French pulled Kingcraft to the wide outside, avoiding the congestion and bumping along the rail. The outsiders Palmerston and Muster led the race in the straight from Macgregor, but two furlongs from the finish the favourite came under pressure and was soon beaten. French made his move on Kingcraft just over a furlong from the finish, took the lead from Palmerston and quickly pulled clear to win by four lengths. The win delighted the bookmakers who had heavy liabilities on Macgregor. Lord Falmouth had accepted a bet of sixpence on Kingcraft from the wife of his trainer Mathew Dawson.

Dawson had to keep and feed the horse at his own expense for several months before Merry agreed to hand over the money. Dawson trained the colt at Russley Park, near Lambourn.", "Thormanby's dam was the outstanding race mare Alice Hawthorn (left), who won fifty-two races including the Goodwood and Doncaster Cups. The identity of his sire was officially problematic, as Alice Hawthorn was covered by two stallions, Windhound and Melbourne in 1856. Melbourne, the sire of the Triple Crown winner West Australian was, however, true-breeding bay, meaning that all his registered offspring were bay or brown. It is almost certain, therefore, that the chestnut Thormanby was a son of the less famous Windhound. This view was supported by the testimony of Mathew Dawson, who was working at the stud at the time of Thormanby's conception: he reported that Alice Hawthorn had rejected Melbourne, but been receptive to Windhound.", "Thormanby stood as a stallion at Croft stud, near Darlington, Park Paddocks at Newmarket and the Moorlands stud near York. He  was a successful stallion, siring the 2000 Guineas winners Atlantic and Charibert and being the Champion sire of 1869. He is present in the pedigrees of almost all modern Thoroughbreds through his daughter, Rouge Rose, who produced the Derby Winner Bend Or. Thormanby sired almost a hundred winners before dying suddenly at the age of eighteen in 1875.
