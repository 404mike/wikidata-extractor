Her career lasted over fifty years.\nBorn in Oldbury, Worcestershire, she studied Voice at the Royal College of Music in London between 1927 and 1930. During the 1930s, she made many radio broadcasts as a soprano from the BBC studios at Birmingham. By the late 1930s, she had moved into acting as well as singing. This led in 1942 to a small part in Francis Durbridge's Paul Temple Intervenes.\nIn 1945, she took on the role of Paul's wife, Steve Temple, and continued to play the part until the radio serials came to an end in 1968. The broadcast of many of the surviving Paul Temple serials on BBC Radio 4 Extra has led to a revival of interest in her.\nWhile \"Steve Temple\" might have been her longest-lasting creation, she was a very frequent radio actress into the 1970s and beyond. During the 1950s, she created the part of the (fictional) Austrian soprano Elsa Strauss in the Hilda Tablet series of radio plays by Henry Reed.\nHer career was mostly on radio with occasional films and theatre work.\nIn 1964, she played the part of the baby in a radio adaptation of Mervyn Peake's long poem The Rhyme Of The Flying Bomb. \nIn 1983, she chose to celebrate the golden jubilee of her first appearance on radio by appearing as \"Helen Lancaster\" in N. C. Hunter's play, Waters of the Moon.\nShe died at her farmhouse in Maresfield, near Uckfield, Sussex on 16 December 1989, aged 84.", "link_mentions": {}}}
