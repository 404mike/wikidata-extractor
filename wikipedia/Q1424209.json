Her career lasted over fifty years.\nBorn in Oldbury, Worcestershire, she studied Voice at the Royal College of Music in London between 1927 and 1930. During the 1930s, she made many radio broadcasts as a soprano from the BBC studios at Birmingham. By the late 1930s, she had moved into acting as well as singing. This led in 1942 to a small part in Francis Durbridge's Paul Temple Intervenes.\nIn 1945, she took on the role of Paul's wife, Steve Temple, and continued to play the part until the radio serials came to an end in 1968. The broadcast of many of the surviving Paul Temple serials on BBC Radio 4 Extra has led to a revival of interest in her.\nWhile \"Steve Temple\" might have been her longest-lasting creation, she was a very frequent radio actress into the 1970s and beyond. During the 1950s, she created the part of the (fictional) Austrian soprano Elsa Strauss in the Hilda Tablet series of radio plays by Henry Reed.\nHer career was mostly on radio with occasional films and theatre work.\nIn 1964, she played the part of the baby in a radio adaptation of Mervyn Peake's long poem The Rhyme Of The Flying Bomb. \nIn 1983, she chose to celebrate the golden jubilee of her first appearance on radio by appearing as \"Helen Lancaster\" in N. C. Hunter's play, Waters of the Moon.\nShe died at her farmhouse in Maresfield, near Uckfield, Sussex on 16 December 1989, aged 84.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Uckfield", "response": ["Emma Lee French was born in Uckfield in 1836.

The longest-running team, and the most popular with audiences, was Peter Coke (pronounced Cooke) and Marjorie Westbury, who starred together in every serial made between 1954 and 1968 \u2013 and Marjorie Westbury also co-starred as Steve Temple in every serial aired between 1945 and 1954.", "Many of the earliest serials, in which the eponymous hero was played by a wide variety of different actors, have not survived the passage of time (largely because these recordings had no value to the BBC once Peter Coke had become synonymous with the lead character). Several were remade in the 1940s, in abridged form, as feature films. However some of the early radio serials do still exist: including Paul Temple Intervenes from 1942, featuring the first appearance in the series by Marjorie Westbury, in a supporting role, who would later co-star as Mrs Temple. All but one of the serials starring Peter Coke also exist: since 2003 these have been regularly repeated on digital station BBC Radio 7 (now BBC Radio 4 Extra). In 2006 the station tracked down the then 93-year-old Coke for a half-hour interview programme, Peter Coke and the Paul Temple Affair; and the actor had also been interviewed extensively in 1998, for the half-hour documentary Send For Paul Temple, an episode in the series The Radio Detectives.", "| Paul Temple Intervenes || Carl Bernard || Bernadette Hodgson || 30 October \u2013 18 December 1942 || 8 \u00d7 20 minutes || exists in fullMarjorie Westbury, who in 1945 would take over the role of Mrs Temple, had a supporting role in this serial (as Dolly Fraser \u2013 episode 1 only).Abridged remake in the 1952 film Paul Temple Returns", "| Send for Paul Temple Again || Barry Morse || Marjorie Westbury || 13 September \u2013 1 November 1945|| 8 \u00d7 30 minutes || all lostAbridged remake in the 1948 film Calling Paul TempleRemade in 1968 with Peter Coke and Marjorie Westbury, as Paul Temple and the Alex Affair", "| A Case for Paul Temple || Howard Marion Crawford || Marjorie Westbury || 7 February \u2013 28 March 1946 || 8 \u00d7 30 minutes || all lostRemade in 2011 starring Crawford Logan", "| Paul Temple and the Gregory Affair || Kim Peacock || Marjorie Westbury || 17 October \u2013 19 December 1946 || 10 \u00d7 30 minutes || all lostRemade in 2013 starring Crawford Logan", "| Paul Temple and Steve || Kim Peacock || Marjorie Westbury || 30 March \u2013 18 May 1947 || 8 \u00d7 30 Minutes || all lostRemade in 2010 starring Crawford Logan", "| \"Mr & Mrs Paul Temple\" (abridged remake of Paul Temple and Steve) || Kim Peacock || Marjorie Westbury || 23 November 1947 || 1 \u00d7 45 minutes || lost", "| Paul Temple and the Sullivan Mystery || Kim Peacock || Marjorie Westbury || 1 December 1947 \u2013 19 January 1948 || 8 \u00d7 30 minutes || all lostRemade in 2006 starring Crawford LoganThere was a rumour that recordings of this serial had been found.
