It does not matter if they are ladies, men or Alsatian dogs. If they are not good enough to run the line they should not get the job. Saturday's was the worst assistant refereeing decision I have seen this season by far and I've said that in my report. The fourth Leeds goal was offside by at least four yards and there were numerous other bad decisions in the game. My message is don't be politically correct and promote people just for the sake of it.\" However, the president of the Referees' Association at the time, Peter Willis, replied: \"She's a very good official...I think the situation is very sad. As a manager of a football club, Strachan is responsible for his players and he is entitled to his opinion on the performance of the officials, but to talk about the sex of the official is irrelevant.\"Gordon Strachan's criticism of Toms, also FIFA status confirmation: article at The Independent website, via the FindArticles service."]}, {"page": "2000 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["Ferguson argued that Riley had created the incident that saw Keane sent off for his tackle on Poyet: \"The referee waited too long to act. There were a lot of players going in hard right throughout the game. You have to be fair to both camps and we were just waiting to see how long he (Riley) was going to leave it. It is a showpiece occasion but if someone commits a yellow card offence, the appropriate action should be taken.\" Hasselbaink apologised to Keane and said he had made an error in the earlier tackle. The Referees' Association president Peter Willis expressed concern that the Premier League will become \"a bloodbath\" if there was continued scrutiny of \"officials' performances\":  \"All of us accept that football is an emotional game, we can make errors of judgement in challenges but there was no misinterpretation of what happened yesterday and I don't think Sir Alex Ferguson can argue against that.\""]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["An uneventful final came to life 12 minutes from time when, with the score goalless, Kevin Moran was dismissed by referee Peter Willis for a 'professional foul' on Peter Reid \u2013 the first ever sending-off in an FA Cup final.
