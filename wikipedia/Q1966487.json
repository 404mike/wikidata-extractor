It took Chorley just seven games to score his first goal of the new season, scoring a penalty in a 3\u20132 home win over Bristol Rovers in the League Cup. He also scored a 90th-minute equaliser in a 2\u20132 draw away to Huddersfield Town on 24 September 2011, netting from close range in a match that Orient had trailed by two goals. Shortly after the club's next match, Chorley suffered an injury that ruled him out for two months. He returned to the first-team in December 2011, but a red card in a 1\u20130 win over Stevenage would mean he missed another three matches. During the campaign, he played in 37 games and scored twice, in a season that witnessed Leyton Orient narrowly avoid relegation, finishing just above the four relegation places. Chorley was again a permanent fixture during the first half of Leyton Orient's 2012\u201313 season, making 34 appearances and spending most of the season as club captain as a result of Nathan Clarke's absence. He scored twice for Orient during the season, with his goals coming in 4\u20131 victories over Yeovil Town and Carlisle United respectively. With his contract set to expire at the end of the season, and reported interest from other League One sides, Chorley spoke with Leyton Orient manager Russell Slade about a move away from Brisbane Road, citing a need for a longer contract.
