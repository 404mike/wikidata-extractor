In addition to being \"a fixture\" at the Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival, there were also support slots for many better-known blues artists including B.B. King, Al Green and Van Morrison.  As the Dexters split for a second time, collaborations with musicians such as guitarist Neil Warden, the harmonica player Fraser Speirs and bassist Boz Burrell eventually developed into a permanent lineup known as the Shoestring Band, who continued performing together either as a trio or a larger band until Burrell's death in 2006.

As its leader, the ensemble went on to contest Smith\u2019s dominance of the Scottish jazz world in the late 1980s and the sextet was a key breeding ground for musicians who subsequently came to prominence in their own right, including pianist Brian Kellock, saxophonist Phil Bancroft, trumpeter Colin Steele, bassist Kenny Ellis and guitarist Kevin Mackenzie, all of whom are active in multiple projects both as leaders and sidemen. Another of Rae\u2019s early ventures along side Dundee musician and composer Kevin Murray, was the Giant Stepping Stanes, who broke new ground in combining elements of modern jazz with Scottish folk music, an area of cross-fertilization that has since expanded steadily and fruitfully, not least through the early work of Rae.", "Leaving Scotland again, Rae spent the next five years living in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. There, along with Venezuela musician Julio Pacheco he formed the group Sex and Violence that included musicians from the USA, Cuba, Sweden, Gran Canario, Scotland and Venezuela and recorded the album Ten Wasted Years. Returning once more to his native Scotland, Rae formed Celtic Feet in 1998, a group that incorporated Scotland's jazz and traditional musicians around original compositions by Rae. Again with Brian Kellock and Phil Bancroft along with Eilidh Shaw fiddle, Mario Lima Caribe bass and Simon Thoumire concertina, the ensemble recorded two critically acclaimed albums for the Scottish label Caber Music and performed at festivals throughout Europe.

It's best to experience her in person, but this live set comes close. There's none of her equally amazing piano playing here, but it's hard to think of a better matched keyboard companion than Brian Kellock, Scotland's finest jazz pianist and probably one of the best anywhere. The recording is basic and rather dry, but it catches the interplay between them very well\".", "Peter Quinn, writing in the May 2009 issue of Jazzwise, gave the album four stars and said: \"There was never a scintilla of doubt that a meeting between Liane Carroll and Brian Kellock would produce something a little out of the ordinary, but the breathtaking scope of the duo's music-making on Live At The Lampie is jaw-dropping... Carroll spins endlessly inventive melodic lines in a vocal performance which, purely in terms of visceral excitement and fearless soloing, is unprecedented in her output\".", "#Brian Kellock\u00a0\u2013 piano\t", "*Liane Carroll & Brian Kellock perform \"Love For Sale\" during Live at The Lampie session, October 2008"]}, {"page": "Corrie Dick", "response": ["Corrie also plays improvised solo drum concerts and frequently collaborates with artists such as Martin Speake, Mark Lockheart, Jacob Collier, Bobby Wellins, Brian Kellock, Leafcutter John, Tom Herbert, Pete Wareham, Kit Downes, Jasper H\u00f8iby, Jim Mullen and many other notable musicians."]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 1962 in jazz, deaths of Donald Lambert, Doug Watkins, Eddie South, Harry Barris, Israel Crosby, Jean Goldkette, John Graas, Leo Parker, and Roger Wolfe Kahn; births of Andrej \u0160eban, Angelo Debarre, Arthur Maia, Aydin Esen, Bendik Hofseth, Billy Kilson, Brian Kellock, Caroline Henderson, Cecilia Coleman, Chris Botti, Christina von B\u00fclow, Craig Handy, Cynthia Sayer, Dado Moroni, Darrell Grant, Dennis Mackrel, Eddie Benitez, Eddie Costa, Edsel Gomez, Fred Lonberg-Holm, Glauco Venier, Huw Warren, Ian Shaw, James Morrison, Jimmy Herring, Joanna Connor, Jon Klette, Jude Abbott, Julia Fordham, Juliet Roberts, Kenn Smith, Karoline H\u00f6fler, Lee Aaron, Lisa Ono, Mia \u017dnidari\u010d, Michel Petrucciani, Mike Jones, Mike Walker, Nils Einar Vinjor, Olaf Kamfjord, Paul Tobey, Rachel Z, Ralph Peterson Jr., Renee Rosnes, Rob Bargad, Robert Balzar, Ronny Jordan, Snorre Bjerck, Tapani Rinne, Terence Blanchard, Thomas Agergaard, Tim Armacost, Tor Haugerud, Ugonna Okegwo, and Winard Harper."]}, {"page": "Kellock, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Kellock"]}, {"page": "Kellock", "response": ["*Brian Kellock (born 1962), Scottish jazz pianist"]}, {"page": "Mario Carib\u00e9", "response": ["Carib\u00e9 started learning guitar at the age of 13 and switched to bass a year later, and beginning his career at the local jazz scene.
