He trained as an engraver before moving to the United States for three years, then returned to England to work as a commercial traveller.In the late 1860s, Riley returned to the U.S., where he became an active socialist and gained experience as a journalist.  In 1870, he returned to England once more, and got in touch with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.  He settled in London, where he published Yankee Letters to British Workmen in 1871, and became active in the First International, editing its British journal, the International Herald, from 1872.  By 1875, he had moved to Bristol, then in 1876 he moved to Sheffield on the invitation of John Ruskin to manage St George's Farm at Totley on a communitarian basis.  In Sheffield, he launched a monthly journal, The Socialist, which ran for only six months.The farm project was not a success; the workers, former shoemakers, fell into dispute with each other and with Riley, and the land was not as productive as had been hoped.  With the failure of the project, Ruskin permitted Riley to remain at the farm, but in 1880 Riley moved back to the U.S., where he based himself in Massachusetts, writing socialist articles and farming.  In 1884, Edward Carpenter stayed with Riley while he was visiting Walt Whitman.  In 1889, he moved to Lunenburg, Massachusetts, where he lived until 1896.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Carpenter", "response": ["In Sheffield, Carpenter became increasingly radical. Influenced by a disciple of Engels, Henry Hyndman, he joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in 1883 and attempted to form a branch in the city.  The group instead chose to remain independent, and became the Sheffield Socialist Society. While in the city he worked on a number of projects including highlighting the poor living conditions of industrial workers. In 1884, he left the SDF with William Morris to join the Socialist League. From there he stayed with William Harrison Riley while he was visiting Walt Whitman.David Goodway, Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow, p.44"]}, {"page": "Guild of St George", "response": ["In 1876, Ruskin purchased land in Totley (Ruskin called it Abbeydale), near Sheffield. It was named (and is still called) St George\u2019s Farm. The early work of this co-operative farming scheme met with only limited success, undermined by a series of disagreements (see William Harrison Riley). It was run as a moderately successful market garden and nursery for fifty years until 1938 (but had been sold by the Guild to its manager, George Pearson, in 1929). In 1878 Ruskin purchased a smallholding of 13 acres, with a cottage, originally for the occupation of John Guy and his family, at Cloughton Moor, in North Yorkshire. The Guys moved in 1882, and the land was sold in 1910."]}, {"page": "William Riley", "response": ["*William Harrison Riley (1835\u20131907), British socialist"]}, {"page": "Harrison Riley", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Harrison Riley"]}]}}
