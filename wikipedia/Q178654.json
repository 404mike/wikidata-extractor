It was the first such series in TV sitcom's modern form. While moving away from audio variety towards emphasis on character development, the radio series had been influential in the development of TV situation comedy. The radio series continued to overlap with its TV version. Apart from Tony Hancock, who plays a fictionalised version of himself: a loser whose plans and aspirations are continually ruined by bad luck, its only other regular cast member was the more worldly sidekick played by Sid James later of Carry On fame.

Guyler took on the role in the title character of a Scotland Yard detective in the Light Programme series Inspector Scott Investigates, created by John P. Wynn, that ran from 1957 to 1963. During the half-hour programme a crime was committed; Scott and his sidekick, Det. Sgt. Bingham (Brian Hayes, brother of Patricia Hayes) interviewed two or three suspects; then, while music played, there was a short intermission for listeners to guess 'whodunit' before the final revelation. In Henry Reed's series of radio dramas about Herbert Reeve's inquiries into the life of Richard Shewin, Guyler played General Gland, soldier-scholar, campanologist and author of war memoirs, including in Not a Drum was Heard.
