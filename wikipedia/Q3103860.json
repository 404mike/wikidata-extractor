These would be broadcast during Children's Hour. Later that year, in December 1951, the BBC announced that it was looking for an actor to portray the character of Bunter, prompting seventy-five hopefuls to apply for the part. The search for a suitable actor received wide newspaper coverage, with the Daily Mirror covering the auditions both on its front page and in columnist Ian Mackey's 'diary'. The Daily Telegraph and Reynolds News were among other newspapers that also provided prominent coverage. When a 29-year-oldGerald Campion was born on 23 April 1921 in London actor, Gerald Campion, who was married with two children, was cast in the role of Bunter, a 15-year-old schoolboy, the choice was greeted with mixed reactions.Lofts & Adley p.148RADA trained and educated at University College School, London, Gerald Campion appeared destined to play the part of Billy Bunter. In 1947 he played 'Fatty Mathews' in a play on television called 'Boys in Brown'. Five years later in 1952 he appeared as 'Fat Boy' in the motion picture adaptation of 'The Pickwick Papers'. You can thus see a pattern emerging. Apart from the matter of his age, Campion, although fairly short and somewhat rotund, was a relative lightweight at 11 stone 2 pounds (70.8kg), compared with Bunter's weight of 14 stone 12 1/2\u00a0lb (94.5kg) (as described in The Magnet in 1939),Magnet No.1659 pdf and this added to the controversy (for the television series, Campion would wear padding to make him appear much fatter than he actually was). In fact Campion had already been considered for the role of Bunter, twelve years earlier, when the intention was to make a cinema film based on the character.Start The Week with Richard Baker - BBC Radio 4, Monday 5 May 1980", "Reaction to the first episode of the show was mixed. Jonah Barrington, radio critic of the Sunday Chronicle provided the doubled-edged observation that Bunter was the greatest TV character since Muffin the Mule.
