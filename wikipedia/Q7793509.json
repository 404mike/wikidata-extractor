In 1884, he was the main founder of the Ebbw Vale and Sirhowy Colliery Workmen's Association, serving as its secretary and agent.  The association became part of the South Wales Miners' Federation in 1898, Richards continuing as agent of its Ebbw Vale District until 1901, while also becoming the first general secretary of the SWMF.Richards was a supporter of the Liberal-Labour movement, and was elected to Monmouthshire County Council in 1904.  That year, he won a by-election to become Member of Parliament for West Monmouthshire.  In 1909, he was instructed by his trade union to resign the Liberal whip and take the Labour whip and at both the 1910 General Elections he stood as a Labour candidate. He held the seat until its abolition at the 1918 general election, when he was elected for the new Ebbw Vale constituency. He resigned from Parliament in 1920.Out of Parliament, Richards devoted his time to the SWMF, and the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB).  He represented them on the General Council of the Trades Union Congress from 1925, and served as President of the MFGB from 1929 to 1930.Richards was made a Privy Councillor in 1918.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Thomas Richards (priest) (c. 1687\u20131760), Anglican priest and canon of St Asaph's Cathedral", "*Thomas Richards (1859\u20131931)"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1910\u20131936)", "response": ["*Thomas Richards (1859\u20131931)"]}, {"page": "Miners' Federation of Great Britain", "response": [" | Thomas Richards", " |rowspan=2| Thomas Richards"]}, {"page": "Liberal-Labour (UK)", "response": ["|Thomas Richards"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931)", "response": ["|Thomas Richards"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Thomas Richardson, Whitehaven, 1910\u201318"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Richards "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Richards"]}, {"page": "Ebbw Vale (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Richards"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|Thomas Richards"]}, {"page": "South Wales Miners' Federation", "response": ["The Amalgamated Association of Miners (AAM) was influential in South Wales during the early 1870s, but it collapsed in 1875.  Of the AAM's various districts, only the Cambrian Miners' Association survived the collapse, but it steadily grew in membership, and other local unions were founded.  The local unions disagreed over whether to negotiate wages as part of a \"sliding scale\", where pay rose and fell in line with coal export prices.  This began to change in 1892, when the unions formed a joint committee.  Its initial members were William Abraham, David Beynon, Thomas Davies, Daronwy Isaac, J. Jones, David Morgan, Alfred Onions and Morgan Weeks from the sliding scale districts, and David Ajax, John Davies, J. Edwards, Joseph Phillips and M. Williams from the non-sliding scale districts.  Thomas Richards was elected as secretary, and the following year, Abraham was elected as president, Morgan as vice-president, and Josiah Edwards as the treasurer.  The committee achieved little, but formed a basis for the formation of the SWMF.", "In the early twentieth century, its leadership were aligned with the Liberal Party; MPs Thomas Richards, William Abraham, John Williams and William Brace all took the Liberal Party whip in parliament.  However, when the MFGB held a ballot on affiliation to the Labour Party in 1906, a majority of SWMF members voted in favour.  As the national federation narrowly voted against, another vote was held in 1908, by which time SWMF members voted 74,675 to 44,616 in favour.David Howell, British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906, p.51  Some in the union were radicalised by such events as the Cambrian Combine Dispute and the Tonypandy Riot of 1910."]}, {"page": "West Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=2| Thomas Richards", "thumb|120px|Thomas Richards", "*Labour: Thomas Richards"]}, {"page": "Thomas Richards", "response": ["Thomas Richards may refer to:", "* Thomas Richards (priest) (c. 1687\u20131760), Welsh priest and writer", "* Thomas Richards (cricketer) (1855\u20131923), Australian cricketer", "* Thomas Richards (film editor) (1899\u20131946), American film editor", "* Thomas Richards (historian) (1878\u20131962), Welsh historian, author and librarian", "* Thomas Richards (mayor) (born 1943), mayor of Rochester, New York", "* Thomas Richards (Welsh politician) (1859\u20131931), Welsh Labour Party Member of Parliament", "* Thomas Richards of Coychurch (c. 1710\u20131790), Welsh curate and lexicographer", "* Thomas Richardson (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Tredegar Medical Aid Society", "response": ["By June 1911 the society was well regarded nationally.

The Tredegar society made large changes that year as the new legislation meant they had to stop giving sick pay of two shillings per week.
