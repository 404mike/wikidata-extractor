Raised in Scotland, Neill taught at several schools before attending the University of Edinburgh in 1908\u20131912. He took two jobs in journalism before World War I, and taught at Gretna Green Village School in the first year of the war, writing his first book, A Dominie's Log (1915), as a diary of his life there as head teacher. He joined a Dresden school in 1921 and founded Summerhill on returning to England in 1924. Summerhill gained renown in the 1930s and then in the 1960s\u20131970s, due to progressive and counter-culture interest. Neill wrote 20 books.

The writer Sigurd Hoel asked: \"When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in a microscope when one was not a trained biologist?\" Reich received support from overseas, first from the anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski, who in March wrote to the press in Norway that Reich's sociological works were \"a distinct and valuable contribution toward science\", and from A.

Literary inspiration for the character can be found in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, E. T. A. Hoffmann's The Strange Child, Anne of Green Gables, and Daddy Long Legs in addition to myths, fairytales, and legends. Andersen argues that the \"misanthropic, emotionally stunted age\" of the Second World War, during which Lindgren was developing the character, provided the most influence: the original version of Pippi, according to Andersen, \"was a cheerful pacifist whose answer to the brutality and evil of war was goodness, generosity, and good humor.\""]}, {"page": "Summerhill School", "response": ["Neill distanced himself from some schools for confusing freedom and licence: \"Look at those American Summerhill schools.

In particular, the 1960 American edition of Neill's writings,  Summerhill, made the school into an example for a wide public, and led to an American movement with copycat schools. A. S.
