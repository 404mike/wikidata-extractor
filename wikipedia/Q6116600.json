This view believes the Bible to teach that a husband is called to lovingly lead, protect and provide for his wife and family, and that the wife should joyfully and intelligently affirm and submit to her husband's leadership. Complementarians also believe the Bible to teach that men are to bear primary responsibility to lead the church and that therefore only men should be elders. Wimber stated, \"I personally do not favor ordaining women as elders in the local church ... I encourage our women to participate in any ministry, except church governance.\" Sam Storms, when discussing this issue, stated \"Others would point out that in spite of his complementarian convictions, Wimber permitted at least two notable exceptions: both Jackie Pullinger (Hong Kong) and Ann Watson (England) served as the senior leaders of their respective congregations (although I should mention that Watson viewed her role as exceptional, given the premature death of her husband, and not a position to which women in ordinary circumstances should aspire).\""]}, {"page": "Women as theological figures", "response": ["* Jackie Pullinger MBE, contemporary missionary working with inner city gangs, and founder of St Stephen's Society in Hong Kong"]}, {"page": "New Wine", "response": ["Over the years, New Wine has attracted many well known speakers, including Baroness Caroline Cox, Jackie Pullinger, Danielle Strickland, Christy Wimber, J.John, Heidi Baker, Bill Johnson, Francis Chan, Ken Costa and Brother Yun.
