He grew up in County Durham in North East England, and first became interested in acting through Shakespeare productions at his grammar school. Since his career began in the early 1970s, he has played, in his words, \"the full spectrum of characters from the grotesque to musicals... I always play very colourful characters, often a bit crazy, despotic, psychotic\".His credits include several Charles Dickens adaptations, and the eccentric ex-detective Brian Lane in New Tricks. He is also an accomplished stage actor who spent nine years with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He originated the role of Th\u00e9nardier in the London production of Les Mis\u00e9rables, and won an Olivier Award in the title role in Sweeney Todd.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Braveheart", "response": ["* Alun Armstrong as Mornay"]}, {"page": "1946", "response": ["** Alun Armstrong, English actor"]}, {"page": "David Jason", "response": ["Jason starred in London Weekend Television's Lucky Feller (1975\u201376), written by Terence Frisby and produced by Humphrey Barclay. About two brothers in south-east London, the series was in many ways a forerunner to Only Fools And Horses, only Jason was in the more dopey 'Rodney' role with Peter Armitage playing the cleverer of the two. The brothers drove around in a comical bubble car, a precursor to the famous Trotters' van; and there was even the joke where, just as he was trying to impress the girl (Cheryl Hall), Jason casually leaned back against the bar, without his knowing that barman had just lifted it behind his back, and fell through. This situation was re-enacted in Only Fools And Horses. He played the lead role of Peter Barnes in the ATV sitcom A Sharp Intake of Breath (1977\u201381), alongside Alun Armstrong and Richard Wilson. In 1979, he appeared as Buttons in the pantomime Cinderella at Newcastle's Theatre Royal, starring Leah Bell and Bobby Thompson, produced by Michael Grayson and directed by John Blackmore."]}, {"page": "Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?", "response": ["|Terry appears in court charged with assault after a fight with Douggie Scaife (Alun Armstrong).
