He was the club's leading scorer for four seasons in a row, from 1951\u201352 to 1954\u201355, scoring 31 times in 1953-54 as Everton was promoted from Football League Division Two to Division One, one half of a prolific partnership with Dave Hickson. He left for Bury in 1956, playing for the club until 1959, having made 82 appearances and scoring 43 goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Parker", "response": ["*John Willie Parker, English former professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Dave Hickson", "response": ["His physical approach as centre forward, coupled with his determination soon made him a crowd favourite. Off the pitch, Hickson was a different man, quiet and unassuming, but the Dave Hickson that pulled on a Blue shirt and entered battle every Saturday afternoon was an aggressive character, no quarter given or asked. This aggression would lead to several run-ins with officials, and three sendings-off during his career, but that was his style & the fans loved it. A youthful Hickson with his striking appearance, fully quiffed up with a shock of blonde hair, as was the style of the day, was one of the few things to get excited about on the terraces of Goodison Park. Dave Hickson soon forged a productive partnership with John Willie Parker, with Hickson being the target man. Although his reputation as an aerial threat was well known, Hickson was also a difficult opponent with the ball on the floor, and could produce a powerful shot, which earned him the nickname Cannonball Kid."]}, {"page": "List of Everton F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|John Willie Parker||||FW||1947\u20131956||176||89"]}]}}
