In the 1980s he worked on much less prestigious projects, and his final films consisted of lower-budgeted theatrical releases and TV movies.According to one obituary, \"Regardless of whether he was directing a light comedy, war epic or crime drama, Mr. Guillermin had a reputation as an intense, temperamental perfectionist, notorious for screaming at cast and crew alike. His domineering manner often alienated producers and actors...But Mr. Guillermin's impeccable eye and ability to capture both intimate moments and large-scale action scenes usually overcame that reputation.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Conan the Barbarian", "response": ["The third film in the Conan trilogy was planned for 1987 to be titled Conan the Conqueror.

However, Sellers won the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA award nomination for his performance, and it was well received by critics. Stanley Kubrick asked Sellers to play the role of Clare Quilty in the 1962 film Lolita, opposite James Mason and Shelley Winters. Kubrick had seen Sellers in The Battle of the Sexes and listened to the album The Best of Sellers, and was impressed by the range of characters he could portray. Sellers was apprehensive about accepting the role, doubting his ability to successfully portray the part of a flamboyant American television playwright who was according to Sellers \"a fantastic nightmare, part homosexual, part drug addict, part sadist\". Kubrick encouraged Sellers to improvise and stated that he often reached a \"state of comic ecstasy\". Kubrick had American jazz producer Norman Granz record portions of the script for Sellers to listen to, so he could study the voice and develop confidence, granting Sellers a free artistic licence. Sellers later claimed that his relationship with Kubrick became one of the most rewarding of his career. Writing in The Sunday Times, Dilys Powell commented that Sellers gave \"a firework performance, funny, malicious, only once for a few seconds overreaching itself, and in the murder scene which is both prologue and epilogue achieving the macabre in comedy\".
