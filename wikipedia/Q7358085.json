De Haan took over Saga in 1984 when his father retired, and then ran the company with his brother Peter for a further twenty years, launching Saga-branded radio stations to accompany the group's holidays and financial services. He chose to leave the business in 2004, selling the entire Saga Group (which included insurance and holiday businesses) to a management buyout for \u00a31.35 billion, although he continued to run some of the radio stations himself. In that year he bought Folkestone Harbour for \u00a311 million.\nThe Roger De Haan Charitable Trust was established in 1978, offering charitable support to a variety of charities and community organisations, mostly in the area around Folkestone and south east Kent.\nIn 2003/2004 he was awarded an honorary fellowship of Canterbury Christ Church University.De Haan was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2004 for services to business, education and charity in 2004 and was knighted in the 2014 New Years Honours List for services to education and to charity in Kent and overseas. He regularly appears in the Sunday Times' 'rich list'. Following the sale of Saga, he retained ownership of two digital radio stations, PrimeTime Radio and Saga Radio (Digital), but following continuing heavy losses took the decision to close them in 2006.\nIn April 2016, his net worth was estimated at \u00a3900 million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.During the 2019 United Kingdom general election, De Haan donated \u00a3125,000 to the Conservative Party and \u00a33,000 to Damian Collins, the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Seaford College", "response": ["*Sir Roger De Haan , chairman of Saga Group"]}, {"page": "PrimeTime Radio", "response": ["The Chairman of PrimeTime Radio, Roger De Haan announced in November 2005 that he was withdrawing PrimeTime Radio from DAB digital radio from May 2006 when its multiplex licence with Digital One ended.
