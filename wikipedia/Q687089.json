In his spare time he also studied Russian history and in 1934 won a scholarship to study in Moscow and Leningrad. After these studies he attended the Agricultural College in Avon Croft, Evesham, Worcestershire.\nOn 19 June 1936, he joined Lincolnshire Constabulary. He was employed in various departments, but later specialised in traffic. He rose to the rank of sergeant.\nAfter the Second World War, he founded the International Police Association to be a global police friends club. He believed in the positive qualities of friendship, which is why the motto of the association is \"Serve through friendship\", also rendered \"Servo per Amikeco\" (Service through friendship) in Esperanto.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "International Police Association", "response": ["thumb|upright=1.4|A 2016 stamp sheet of Romania dedicated to the 66th anniversary of IPA and to Arthur Troop", "In the years 1948-49, Arthur Troop made contact with his police friends in both the UK and abroad. In 1949 he had an article published in the British Police Review under the pseudonym of \u2018Aytee\u2019. Following an amazing response, Arthur was convinced he should proceed, and the IPA was founded on 1 January 1950 under the Esperanto motto 'Servo per Amikeco' (Service Through Friendship). Arthur Troop became the first Secretary General of the British Section. His notion of an association with development of social, cultural and professional links amongst its members, in an environment free from distinction of rank, gender, race, language or religion, became a reality. ", "With the help of early pioneers, Arthur Troop worked untiringly to encourage the founding of other National Sections. From small beginnings the IPA message quickly took hold and the formation of new Sections throughout the world became rapid. Soon there were sections in the majority of Western Europe. In 1955, at the first International Executive Committee meeting in Paris, Arthur Troop became the first International Secretary General, a post he held until he stood down in 1966 for personal reasons.
