He returned in a 1\u20130 away win over Kettering on 6 February 2010, before being handed a three-match suspension as a result of being sent off during a 1\u20130 away defeat to Ebbsfleet a week later after his elbow caught Dean Pooley. This resulted in a head wound that required three stitches for Pooley, and York's directors and manager apologised to Ebbsfleet manager Liam Daish for the tackle. Following Chester's expulsion from the Football Conference in March 2010, the three goals Brodie scored against them were discounted as their results were expunged. He scored for the first time in 12 matches with 2 goals in a 4\u20130 victory away to Grays on 30 March 2010. He scored two goals against Barrow on 13 April 2010 in a 3\u20130 home victory, a result that confirmed York's place in the play-offs."]}, {"page": "Pooley", "response": ["*Dean Pooley (born 1986), English footballer"]}]}}
