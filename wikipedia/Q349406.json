He is also the owner and creative director of the record label Marine Parade, which has released material by artists including Evil Nine, ILS, Alex Metric and Jape. Born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England, he first began DJing in 1991, originally mixing deep house and later drum and bass. After becoming an in-demand DJ around Britain, he released his first mix album Coastal Breaks (1996) and formed the electronic music duo Tsunami One with Kevin Beber. From 1999 to 2001, Freeland  hosted a show on Friday night on London's Kiss 100 FM. In 2000, he released his debut studio album, Now & Them.\nFreeland is also one third of The Acid. The band consists of Californian producer, composer, professor of music technology, Steve Nalepa and the Australian, Los Angeles based artist, RY X. On 14 April 2013, the band released their debut self-titled EP, along with a video for the track \"Basic Instinct\". On 7 July 2014, the band released their debut album entitled Liminal on Infectious Music (UK) and Mute (US).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coldcut", "response": ["In 2001, Coldcut produced tracks for the Sega music video game Rez.

By means of audio sampling, fragments of his rants, diatribes, social criticisms, and philosophies have found their way into many musical works, such as the live version of Super Furry Animals' \"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\" and Adam Freeland's \"We Want Your Soul\". His influence on the band Tool is well documented as he is sampled at the beginning of their song \"Third Eye\"\u00c6nima (1996); he \"appears\" on the Fila Brazillia album Maim That Tune (1995) and on SPA's eponymously titled album SPA (1997), which are both dedicated to Hicks; the British band Radiohead's second album The Bends (1995) is also dedicated to his memory. American indie rock band Built to Spill's song \"Planting Seeds\" on its 2009 album There Is No Enemy alludes to Hicks's routine on advertising and marketing, which appears on the performance film Bill Hicks: Revelations.

Hiroishi contacted multiple composers to contribute tracks for each zone, including Ken Ishii and Joujouka as well as English artists Coldcut and Adam Freeland. These people both contributed original tracks and licensed remixes of existing numbers for the game. The team also reached out to Underworld, Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers and Aphex Twin, but failed to reach an agreement about using their tracks. In the case of Underworld, the team wanted to use their track \"Rez\" for the opening area, as they had been doing during prototyping. Underworld declined as they did not wish to be associated with any kind of video game violence as the game involved \"shooting things\". This led to Sugiyama creating the opening stage track.
