Date of Act of Bravery, 28th September, 1857\" A most gallant feat was here performed by Lieutenant Blair, who was ordered to take a party of one sergeant and twelve men and bring in a deserted ammunition waggon. As his party approached, a body of fifty or sixty of the enemy's horse came down upon him, from a village, where they had remained unobserved: without a moment's hesitation he formed up his men, and, regardless of the odds, gallantly led them on, dashing through the rebels. He made good his retreat without losing a man, leaving nine of them dead on the field. Of these he killed four himself; but, to my regret, after having run a native\nofficer through the body with his sword, he was severely wounded, the joint of his shoulder being nearly severed.\"\nDespatch from Major-General James Hope Grant, K.C.B., dated 10th January, 1858.Blair was a graduate of University of Glasgow and a Snell exhibitioner at Balliol College, Oxford.
