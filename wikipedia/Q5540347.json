Born in Port Talbot, he played for the Wales Schoolboys team as a youngster and had spells with Port Talbot Athletic and Bridgend Town. In the summer of 1927, Hayes moved to England to join Barnsley, but he never made a senior appearance for the club. He transferred to Third Division North side Nelson in March 1928, one of several new signings by the club as they strove to avoid finishing bottom of the league.\nHayes made his Nelson debut on 17 March 1928 in the 5\u20134 victory away at Hartlepools United. He scored his first goals for the club the following month, netting twice in the 4\u20130 home win against Darlington on 7 April, and scoring a consolation goal in the reverse fixture a week later. Hayes made a total of nine league appearances for Nelson, scoring five goals, but was released by the club at the end of the 1927\u201328 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Hayes", "response": ["George Hayes may refer to:", "* Sir George Hayes (judge) (1805\u20131869), British jurist", "* George Hayes (British actor) (1888\u20131967), British stage and film actor", "* George Hayes (ice hockey) (1914\u20131987), Canadian NHL linesman", "* George Hayes (footballer) (1908\u20131984), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Arthur Hepworth", "response": ["In March 1928, Hepworth moved from Barnsley to struggling Football League Third Division North club Nelson, along with inside forward George Hayes.

He went on to make 10 appearances during the remainder of the 1927\u201328 campaign as the side finished bottom of the division and were forced to apply for re-election to the League.Dykes, p. 7 In the summer of 1928 Nelson signed two new wing-halves, Jim Metcalfe and David Suttie, meaning Hepworth spent the majority of the 1928\u201329 season in the reserves.
