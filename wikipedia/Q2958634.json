She filled many roles in film production, outside of acting. She served as a director, producer, editor, lighting designer, and received credit for costume design for the film Revelation. She wrote screenplays under the pseudonym Peter M. Winters, and was a director for films credited to the name of her partner Charles Bryant. In her film adaptations of works by such notable writers as Oscar Wilde and Ibsen, she developed filmmaking techniques that were considered daring at the time. Her film projects, including A Doll's House (1922), based on Ibsen, and Salom\u00e9 (1923), based on Wilde's play, were critical and commercial failures. Salome, however, has become a cult classic, regarded as a feminist milestone in film. In 2000, the film was added to the National Film Registry. By 1925, she could no longer afford to invest in more films, and financial backers withdrew their support.", "In 1899, she married Sergei Golovin, a fellow actor. From 1912 to 1925, Nazimova maintained a \"lavender marriage\" with Charles Bryant (1879\u20131948), a British-born actor. To bolster this arrangement with Bryant, Nazimova kept her marriage to Golovin secret from the press, her fans, and even her friends. In 1923, she arranged to divorce Golovin without traveling to the Soviet Union. Her divorce papers, which arrived in the United States that summer, stated that on May 11, 1923, the marriage of \"citizeness Leventon Alla Alexandrovna\" and Sergius Arkadyevitch Golovin, \"consummated between them in the City Church of Boruysk June 20, 1899\", had been officially dissolved. A little over two years later, on November 16, 1925, Charles Bryant, then 43, surprised the press, Nazimova's fans and Nazimova herself by marrying Marjorie Gilhooley, 23, in Connecticut. When the press uncovered the fact that Charles had listed his current marital status as \"single\" on his marriage license, the revelation that the marriage between Alla and Charles had been a sham from the beginning embroiled Nazimova in a scandal that damaged her career."]}, {"page": "Charles Bryant", "response": ["Charles Bryant may refer to:", "* Charles Bryant (actor) (1879\u20131948), actor"]}, {"page": "List of plays adapted into feature films", "response": ["| Charles Bryant"]}, {"page": "1879 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 8 January \u2013 Charles Bryant, actor and director (died 1948)"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1920", "response": ["| Billions || Ray C.
