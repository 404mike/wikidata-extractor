As far as the casting for this production was concerned, Michael Connors had earlier been the star of a 1959\u201360 crime series, Tightrope!, and the following year, after streamlining his stage name to \"Mike Connors\", starred as the long-running private eye, Mannix (1967\u201375), while Dorothy Provine was one of the stars in The Alaskans (1959\u201360) and The Roaring 20's (1960\u201362). Two years earlier, Provine and Connors played key supporting roles as second leads in the 1964 Jack Lemmon\u2013Romy Schneider comedy vehicle Good Neighbor Sam. All the other Kiss the Girls cast members were primarily recognizable as regular players in European films, including co-stars Raf Vallone, Margaret Lee, and comedy relief Terry-Thomas, who was given a special \"and\" billing at the end of the actors' credits.Plumley, John. \"Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die / Se tutte le donne del mondo (1966)\" (Italian Film Review The Strange Vices Of Cult Cinema, 2012)", "Two specialized guidebooks arrive at a split vote. Michael Weldon's Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film (1983 edition, page 407) agrees with the denigrators, giving it a plot outline that ends with the words, \"[T]he worst Bond imitation known to man. With Terry-Thomas, Margaret Lee, Beverly Adams, Marilu Tolo, Nazi scientists, and Communist Chinese. Filmed in Rio De Janeiro. Connors did Mannix next.\" On the other hand, John Stanley's Creature Features The Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Movie Guide (2000 edition) decided that \"[A]lthough a pale copy of 007's exploits, it has a sparkle to its comedy, gorgeous women in figure-flattering wardrobes, and scenic action set against picturesque Rio.\" After describing the plot, Stanley concludes with, \"Michael Connors walks somnambulistic through his role as super agent Kelly who has minipistols hidden in his clothing and is always eating bananas. A standout is Terry-Thomas as a chauffeur secret agent. Directed by Henry Levin and Dino Maiuri.
