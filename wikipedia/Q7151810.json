He is a member of the Klemperer family. He works on industrial economics, competition policy, auction theory, and climate change economics and policy.\nHaving lived his early life in the Midlands where he attended the independent King Edward's School, Birmingham, Klemperer went on to gain an engineering degree from Cambridge University, and an MBA and an economics PhD from Stanford University. He was elected John Thomson Fellow and tutor of St Catherine's College, Oxford in 1984, and a professorial fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford in 1995, when he became Edgeworth Professor of Economics in succession to Nobel Prize winner James Mirrlees.\nHe was a member of the UK Competition Commission from 2001\u20135. He was elected a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1994, a fellow of the British Academy in 1999, and a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005. He is also a fellow of the European Economic Association.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tropical geometry", "response": ["A tropical line appeared in Paul Klemperer's design of auctions used by the Bank of England during the financial crisis in 2007.

He found that Ricardian trade theory (international trade without input trade) can be interpreted as subtropical convex algebra. This is a digest of Y.

This theory was vital for the theorisation of auctions since the goal of auctions is to assign an object to the buyer who will make the most use of it for the highest price, thus maximising value for both buyer and seller. Nash developed a way for auctions to facilitate absolute gains for society. Vickrey (1996 Nobel Laureate) and Harsanyi (1994 Laureate) extended on Nash's equilibrium specifying ways in which equilibrium can be reached under informational settings. By the 1990s, auction theorists had defined equilibrium bidding conditions for single-object auctions under most realistic auction formats and information settings. The state-of-the-art considers how multiple-object auctions can be performed efficiently; Robert B. Wilson and Paul Milgrom won The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2020 for their work in defining these auctions. Some other state-of-the-art auction designs are Product-Mix Auctions which allows 'package bidding' which was implemented by Paul Klemperer in response to the 2007 Northern Rock Bank Run to sell troubled debt, and Position Auctions which implement a generalized Second-price auction which Google has used to sell ads on Internet search keywords efficiently."]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Paul Klemperer, economist"]}, {"page": "Telecoms crash", "response": ["Paul Klemperer, Oxford University economics professor and adviser to the UK government in its 3G auction, has disputed whether the crash should be blamed on the auction rather than broader economic problems. While agreeing that the licence bidders may have been mistaken in bidding as high as they did, and that the money was a transfer from shareholders to the governments, he argued that the one off and up front sunk costs of the auction should have had no effect when considering the profitability of future investment and should not have significantly affected the future behaviour of the telecoms companies. He also notes that in the United Kingdom it was NTL Incorporated (which failed in its bid) which ended up in the most trouble financially, and questions whether the $100 billion cost of the auctions could explain the $700 billion drop in two years which was seen in the market capitalisation of the telecoms companies."]}, {"page": "Edgeworth Professor of Economics", "response": ["* Paul Klemperer, 1995\u2013present"]}, {"page": "John Geanakoplos", "response": ["Geanakoplos' papers in the 1980s with Paul Klemperer and Jeremy Bulow developed the concept and invented the terminology of Strategic Complements that is now commonly used in game theory, industrial organization and elsewhere."]}, {"page": "Hans Popper", "response": ["Popper spent his five postgraduate years in anatomical pathology and established a biochemical laboratory,Schmid R, Schenker S.
