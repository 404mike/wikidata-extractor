Unusually for the era, the four-piece band performed live, and included an extended guitar solo by Mick Ronson. Tapes of this edition of Top of the Pops were subsequently wiped, but a copy was made by BBC cameraman John Henshall, who had utilised the then new fisheye lens camera techniques for the performance. Henshall was contacted to share his historic material, and was surprised to find he was the only one with a surviving copy. The film has since been preserved and was shown at the British Film Institute in December 2011. The BBC re-broadcast the clip in its Top of the Pops 2 Christmas Special on 21 December 2011, for the first time since the original broadcast in January 1973."]}, {"page": "John Henshall", "response": ["John Henshall may refer to:", "* John Henshall (footballer), footballer for Burslem Port Vale", "* John Henshall (photographer) (born 1942), British photographer, cinematographer, and writer"]}]}}
