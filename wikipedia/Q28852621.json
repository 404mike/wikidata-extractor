By 2007 she was representing Britain in the IAAF World Road Running Championships \nwhich she did for three successive years. The third of these was the most successful as she finished 33rd and the British women's team, of Ross-Cope with Claire Hallissey and Gemma Miles finished in 7th place despite the absence of Paula Radcliffe.In 2009 a 2:36:02 finish in the London Marathon was just outside the required 2:34:00 qualifying time for 2009 World Championships in Athletics.
