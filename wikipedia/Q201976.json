In episode one, Lady Cecily's first scene is an exchange with Jacquetta of Luxembourg and her daughter, Elizabeth Woodville. In this meeting, Jacquetta, as her daughter's mouthpiece, really oversteps the historical mark. The disapproving Duchess, who was known in real life as \"proud Cis\", is too easily overcome by her social inferiors when they whip out her apparent \"secret\" affair with a French archer and Elizabeth commands that she bow before her. Lost for words, she is silenced within minutes, almost cowed by them. While contemporary notions of \"courtesy\" dictated extreme forms of submission to the queen, this is a Lady Cecily straight from the pages of a novel rather than the actual proud aristocrat who asserted her own right to rule."]}, {"page": "2001 in film", "response": ["| The Mists of Avalon || TNT / Constantin Film / Stillking Films / Wolper Organization || Uli Edel (director); Gavin Scott (screenplay); Anjelica Huston, Julianna Margulies, Joan Allen, Samantha Mathis, Edward Atterton, Michael Vartan, Caroline Goodall, Michael Byrne, Hans Matheson, Mark Lewis Jones, Clive Russell, Biddy Hodson, Ian Duncan, Tamsin Egerton, Freddie Highmore, Christopher Fulford, David Calder, Hugh Ross, Edward Jewesbury, Noah Huntley, Karel Dobr\u00fd, Kl\u00e1ra Issov\u00e1, Tony Curran || Drama, Fantasy || Live action", "| The Princess Diaries || Walt Disney Pictures || Garry Marshall (director); Gina Wendkos (screenplay); Anne Hathaway, Heather Matarazzo, H\u00e9ctor Elizondo, Mandy Moore, Caroline Goodall, Robert Schwartzman, Julie Andrews, Erik von Detten, Patrick Flueger, Sean O'Bryan, Sandra Oh, Kathleen Marshall, Mindy Burbano, Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois, Gerald Hathaway, Larry Miller, Patrick Richwood, Willie Brown  || Family, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "2002 in film", "response": ["| Harrison's Flowers || Universal Pictures / Lions Gate Films / StudioCanal || Elie Chouraqui (director/screenplay); Didier Le Pecheur, Isabel Ellsen (screenplay); Andie MacDowell, Elias Koteas, Brendan Gleeson, Adrien Brody, David Strathairn, Alun Armstrong, Caroline Goodall, Diane Baker, Quinn Shephard, Marie Trintignant, Gerard Butler || French || Live action"]}, {"page": "1996 in film", "response": ["| White Squall || Hollywood Pictures / Largo Entertainment || Ridley Scott (director); Todd Robinson (screenplay); Jeff Bridges, John Savage, Caroline Goodall, Ryan Phillippe, Scott Wolf, Balthazar Getty, Jeremy Sisto, Jason Marsden, Eric Michael Cole, Julio Oscar Mechoso, David Lascher, Ethan Embry, David Selby, Jordan Clarke, \u017deljko Ivanek, James Rebhorn, Jill Larson, Lizzy Mackay || Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "1994 in film", "response": ["| Disclosure || Warner Bros.
