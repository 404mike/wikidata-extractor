Frederick Carrington during the Second Matabele War. In June 1896 he met here and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Africa. This was a formative experience for Baden-Powell not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas originated here. During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills, Burnham augmented Baden-Powell's woodcraft skills, inspiring him and sowing seeds for both the programme and for the code of honour later published in Scouting for Boys. Practised by frontiersmen of the American Old West and indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally little known to the British Army but well known to the American scout Burnham. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting. Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. During this time in the Matobo Hills Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hatBy a happy co-incidence, these hats were already called \"Boss of the Plains\" hats\u2014or \"B-P hats\" for short like the one worn by Burnham, and acquired his kudu horn, the Ndebele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island to wake the first Boy Scouts and to call them together in training courses."]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors of Bechuanaland", "response": ["||| Frederick Carrington, ||", "||| Frederick Carrington, ||"]}, {"page": "Cecil D'Arcy", "response": ["During the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, Cecil D'Arcy was an officer in the Frontier Light Horse, a mounted unit of 200 volunteers raised at King William's Town in 1877 by Lieutenant Frederick Carrington."]}, {"page": "Frederick Russell Burnham", "response": ["The Second Boer War (October 1899 \u2013 May 1902) was fought between the British and two independent Boer republics, the South African Republic and the Orange Free State, partly the result of long-simmering strife between them. It was directly caused by each side's desire to control the lucrative Witwatersrand gold mines in the Transvaal. Field Marshal Frederick Roberts, one of the British Army's most successful commanders of the 19th century, was appointed to take overall command of British forces, relieving General Redvers Buller, following a number of Boer successes in the early weeks of the war, including the Siege of Mafeking, in which Baden-Powell, his small regiment of men, and the townspeople had been besieged by thousands of Boer troops since the conflict began. Roberts asked General Frederick Carrington, who had commanded the British forces in Matabeleland three years earlier, whom he should appoint as his Chief of Scouts in South Africa. Carrington had selected Burnham for this role and advised Roberts to do the same, describing Burnham as \"the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa.\""]}, {"page": "Second Matabele War", "response": ["Several relief columns were organised to break the siege, but the long trek through hostile countryside took several months.  Late in May, the first two relief columns appeared near Bulawayo on almost the same day but from opposite directions \u2013 Cecil Rhodes and Col.

Plumer (of the York and Lancaster Regiment) from Kimberley and Mafeking, 600 miles to the south. The southern relief forces were nearly ambushed on their approach to Bulawayo, but Selous discovered the whereabouts of the Matabele and the Maxim guns of the relief forces drove back the attackers.

All of the officers and troopers of Forbes' column reported high praise for Burnham's actions and none reported any doubts about his conduct even decades later. One member of the column, Trooper M\u00a0E Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald on 22 December 1944 that once Commandant Raaff took over command it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: \"I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion.\" Burnham proceeded to become a key figure for a number of commanding officers, including Frederick Carrington, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Roberts. Carrington called him \"the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa. He was my Chief of Scouts in '96 in Matabeleland and he was the eyes and ears of my force\". The US President Theodore Roosevelt described him in 1901 as \"a scout and a hunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot, and a fighter\u00a0... the ideal scout.\" While fighting with the British Army in the Second Boer War, Burnham was adjudged to have shown exceptional heroism and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order, then Britain's second highest military honour."]}, {"page": "Dorothy Carrington", "response": ["Dorothy Carrington was the daughter of Major General Sir Frederick Carrington, known for his crushing of the Matabele Rebellion and a friend of Cecil Rhodes.

Eventually, in 1936, she married an  Austrian, Franz Otto Resseguier Waldschutz, whose family estates in Poland had been destroyed during the First World War. Franz went out to Rhodesia, Africa, where she joined him for a short time but the wilderness did not suit her, so she returned to Europe in 1937.

Desperate for provisions, Boer forces decided to attack the garrison with a view to securing the supplies located there. Prior to the battle, the garrison had received intelligence warning them of the attack. As a result, some actions were taken to fortify the position, with a makeshift defensive perimeter being established utilising stores and wagons to create barricades.
