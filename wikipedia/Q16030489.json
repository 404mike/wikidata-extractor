He also won the Glasgow Cup with the Light Blues in 1893. He later re-joined the Govan club after spells with Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and non-league Falkirk, but was only a reserve in his second spell and featured in just four competitive matches, albeit one of these was in the semi-final second replay of the 1897\u201398 Scottish Cup, helping Rangers reach the final which they went on to win.\nAt representative level, Kerr took part in a Scottish national team trial match in March 1892, and in November of that year was selected for the Glasgow FA's annual challenge match against Sheffield.He was the sole survivor of a yachting accident on the Firth of Clyde in 1896 in which two other men drowned, but died from gastritis in 1901 at the age of 30.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1891\u201392 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Neil Kerr"]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Neil Kerr"]}, {"page": "1893\u201394 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Neil Kerr"]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Scottish Football League", "response": ["|CF  ||||Neil Kerr"]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Neil Kerr"]}, {"page": "1897\u201398 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Neil Kerr"]}, {"page": "1885\u201386 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Neil Kerr"]}, {"page": "1884\u201385 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Neil Kerr"]}]}}
