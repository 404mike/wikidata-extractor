Later that year while on tour with John Mellencamp, the band began recording using portable equipment.  Some recording was also done at keyboardist Rami Jaffee's house.  Once the band was finished touring for the year they began recording the bulk of the new record at Jackson Browne's studio in Santa Monica.  By the time the Wallflowers had gotten into Browne's studio, Michael Ward had left the band, leaving them without a lead guitarist for the recording process.  Dylan took on much of the lead guitar duties with Mike McCready, Rusty Anderson and Val McCallum also contributing on guitar.  Moe Z M.D., who had been touring with Mellencamp, contributed additional percussion and background vocals to the album. Red Letter Days was produced by founding Wallflowers member Tobi Miller along with Bill Appleberry.  Recording continued through the new year and was completed on April 12, 2002.  The album was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, who had mixed the band's previous two albums.
