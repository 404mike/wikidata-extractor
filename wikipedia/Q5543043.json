To the south of the hall the inner garden comprises a modern formal garden occupying the site of the original 16th-century formal garden.  Beyond this, in the parkland, are the earthworks of an earlier garden.  The parkland is almost square in shape, with a section curving out from the south border.  It consists of \"one huge grassed area\" with \"lumps and bumps\".  The Cheshire historian George Ormerod, writing in 1819, considered that this area contained a tilting ground for jousting.Quoted in Groves (2004).  That claim is repeated in the hall's official guidebook, which goes on to suggest that it was created in the hope that Queen Elizabeth\u00a0I would visit the hall on her royal progress, but she never did so.  There is some doubt regarding the dating of the creation of the garden, but it is generally accepted that it comprised an Elizabethan pleasure garden.  A raised mound of earth in the southwest corner of the garden would have been used to view the garden from an elevated position.  A corresponding mound at the southeast corner was removed during the Second World War.  To the west of the hall a wooded area known as the Rookery contains mature lime trees. Limited excavation work carried out in 1989\u201390 discovered, inter alia, a filled-in canal running north\u2013south down the centre of the garden. The excavations provided \"a tremendous insight into the past, although not enough to date it with certainty\".

From early childhood insects were her interest and she had great opportunities to study them in the large estate where she grew up. While her brothers went to Rugby School, studying under Thomas Arnold, she was tutored at home by her mother. She took an interest in insects which became more serious on 12 March 1852 when a rare insect led her to Stephen's Manual of British beetles. She acquired a Pillischer microscope around 1863 and began to make more keen observations. She studied agriculture in general and became a local authority on it. When, in 1868, the Royal Horticultural Society began forming a collection of insect pests of the farm for practical purposes, Ormerod contributed greatly to it, and was awarded the Flora medal of the Society."]}, {"page": "Alderley Edge", "response": ["In 1882, George Ormerod in his book The History of Cheshire described the Edge as \"an abrupt and elevated ridge, formerly the site of a Beacon, which bears the appearance of having been detached by some great convulsion of nature from the range of the Macclesfield hills, as Helsby and Beeston seem to have been from those of Delamere and Peckforton.

The original site of the crosses is unknown and it is believed that they were brought to Sandbach in the Middle Ages.  The earliest documentary evidence is by William Smith, the Rouge-Dragon Pursuivant at Arms of Elizabeth\u00a0I, who was from Nantwich. In 1585 he wrote 'two square crosses of stone, on steps, with certain images and writings thereon graven [standing] hard together.  Either after the Reformation or during the Civil War they were thrown down and their parts were scattered over a wide area.  Larger pieces of the crosses were found as far away as Oulton and Tarporley while smaller pieces were found on various sites in Sandbach.
