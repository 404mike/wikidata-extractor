Kaufman (29 September 1942 \u2013 11 August 2013) was a British biologist. He was Professor Emeritus at University of Edinburgh having been Professor of Anatomy there from 1985 to 2007. He taught anatomy and embryology for more than 30 years, initially at the University of Cambridge, when he was a Fellow of King's College, and more recently (from 1985 to 1997) in Edinburgh.\nBorn in London into an Orthodox Jewish family, during his early years at the University of Edinburgh, he re-instituted a course for an intercalated degree (an honours science degree taken within a medical degree course) in anatomy, absent for many years in this subject. With this he brought a new life of exploration and research within the department of anatomy.In 1981 Kaufman and Martin Evans at the University of Cambridge in England and Gail R. Martin in America were the first to derive embryonic stem cells (ES cells) from mouse embryos. He published four books on mouse embryology and three books on historical aspects of military surgery. He also published a book on Medical Teaching in Edinburgh during the 18th and 19th centuries, a book on the History of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society and biographies of Dr. John Barclay and Mr. Robert Liston. He also published about 240 papers on a wide range of embryological and medical historical topics. He was awarded the F.R.S. Edin. in 2008.\nHe was a leading authority on mouse development.He was also Honorary Librarian at the Royal Medical Society in Edinburgh, having been Senior President from 1966 to 1967. He died after a long illness at an Edinburgh nursing home in 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stem cell", "response": ["In 1981, embryonic stem (ES) cells were first isolated and successfully cultured using mouse blastocysts by British biologists Martin Evans and Matthew Kaufman. This allowed the formation of murine genetic models, a system in which the genes of mice are deleted or altered in order to study their function in pathology. By 1998, embryonic stem cells were first isolated by American biologist James Thomson, which made it possible to have new transplantation methods or various cell types for testing new treatments. In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka\u2019s team in Kyoto, Japan converted fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells by modifying the expression of only four genes. The feat represents the origin of induced pluripotent stem cells, known as iPS cells."]}, {"page": "Embryonic stem cell", "response": ["* 1981: Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) were independently first derived from a mouse embryos by two groups.  Martin Evans and Matthew Kaufman from the Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge published first in July, revealing a new technique for culturing the mouse embryos in the uterus to allow for an increase in cell number, allowing for the derivation of ES cell from these embryos. Gail R. Martin, from the Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, published her paper in December and coined the term \"Embryonic Stem Cell\". She showed that embryos could be cultured in vitro and that ES cells could be derived from these embryos.", "Embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the early embryo, which are harvested from the donor mother animal.  Martin Evans and Matthew Kaufman reported a technique that delays embryo implantation, allowing the inner cell mass to increase.  This process includes removing the donor mother's ovaries and dosing her with progesterone, changing the hormone environment, which causes the embryos to remain free in the uterus.  After 4\u20136 days of this intrauterine culture, the embryos are harvested and grown in in vitro culture until the inner cell mass forms \u201cegg cylinder-like structures,\u201d which are dissociated into single cells, and plated on fibroblasts treated with mitomycin-c (to prevent fibroblast mitosis).  Clonal cell lines are created by growing up a single cell.  Evans and Kaufman showed that the cells grown out from these cultures could form teratomas and embryoid bodies, and differentiate in vitro, all of which indicating that the cells are pluripotent."]}, {"page": "Martin Evans", "response": ["Sir Martin John Evans  (born 1 January 1941) is a British biologist who,  with Matthew Kaufman, was the first to  culture mice embryonic stem cells and cultivate them in a laboratory in 1981.

He then went to University College London where he learned laboratory skills supervised by Elizabeth Deuchar. In 1978, he moved to the Department of Genetics, at the University of Cambridge, and in 1980 began his collaboration with Matthew Kaufman. They explored the method of using blastocysts for the isolation of embryonic stem cells. After Kaufman left, Evans continued his work, upgrading his laboratory skills to the newest technologies, isolated the embryonic stem cell of the early mouse embryo and established it in a cell culture. He genetically modified and implanted it into adult female mice with the intent of creating genetically modified offspring, work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2007. Today, genetically modified mice are considered vital for medical research.", "He became a lecturer in the Anatomy and Embryology department at University College London, where he did research and taught PhD students and undergraduates.
