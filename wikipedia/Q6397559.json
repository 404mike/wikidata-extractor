He was best known for his television roles, in which he became familiar for his \"portrayal of establishment types\".During the Second World War, Stoney served with the Royal Air Force. On television, he appeared in three serials of the science fiction series Doctor Who over a period of ten years, playing Mavic Chen in The Daleks' Master Plan (1965), Tobias Vaughn in The Invasion (1968) and Tyrum in Revenge of the Cybermen (1975). Stoney also appeared in two episodes of another BBC science fiction series, Blake's 7, playing Councillor Joban in the episode Hostage and Ardus in the episode Animals. He also played the astrologer Thrasyllus in the 1976 BBC adaptation of I, Claudius, a role he had earlier played in Granada Television's 1969 series The Caesars.Other credits include: The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Saint, Danger Man, The Avengers, Dr. Finlay's Casebook, The Prisoner, Softly, Softly, Man in a Suitcase, The Troubleshooters, Doomwatch, Freewheelers, Z-Cars, The Tomorrow People, Ace of Wands, Special Branch, The Onedin Line, Fall of Eagles, Space: 1999, The New Avengers, Quatermass, Hammer House of Horror, Bergerac, All Creatures Great and Small, The Bill and in the highest-rated episode of Inspector Morse.In 1985, it was reported in the Doctor Who fan magazine DWB that Stoney had died at the age of 64, but in 1987 he made an appearance at a Doctor Who convention to prove he was very much alive, to the shock of the fans.  He retired in 1993. Stoney died on his 87th birthday, 22 January 2008, in Chiswick, after a long battle with skin cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Prisoner", "response": ["* Kevin Stoney"]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| Ordeal by Innocence || Cannon Films || Desmond Davis (director); Alexander Stuart (screenplay); Donald Sutherland, Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer, Sarah Miles, Ian McShane, Diana Quick, Annette Crosbie, Michael Elphick, George Innes, Valerie Whittington, Phoebe Nicholls, Michael Maloney, Cassie Stuart, Anita Carey, Ron Pember, Kevin Stoney, Brian Glover || Mystery || Live action"]}, {"page": "1983 in film", "response": ["| The Dresser || Columbia Pictures || Peter Yates (director); Ronald Harwood (screenplay); Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, Edward Fox, Zena Walker, Eileen Atkins, Michael Gough, Cathryn Harrison, Betty Marsden, Sheila Reid, Lockwood West, Donald Eccles, Llewellyn Rees, Guy Manning, Anne Mannion, Kevin Stoney, Ann Way, John Sharp, Kathy Staff, Roger Avon || Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Cyberman", "response": ["The Cybermen next appeared in The Moonbase (1967) opposite the Second Doctor. In 2070, the Cybermen attempt to remotely destroy the Earth by affecting its weather patterns with a device called the Gravitron. However, the Gravitron is used against them, hurling them into space. Later in the same television season, The Tomb of the Cybermen saw a 25th Century human expedition discover sarcophagi containing hibernating Cybermen on the planet Telos, where the creatures arise and attack. This episode introduced the cybermats, small mechanical scouts used by the Cybermen, as well as the Cyber Controller. In the following season, in The Wheel in Space (1968), the Doctor and his crew face off against the Cybermen on a marooned Earth space station in the 21st Century. This episode introduces the Cyber-Planner, an immobile unit which directs the Cybermen. The Cybermen plan to take over the space station, after which their fleet will invade Earth. The Doctor uses an x-ray laser to destroy the Cybermen. In the next season, The Invasion has the Doctor and his companions visit late 20th century England, where he discovers an army of Cybermen are hidden on Earth and working with magnate Tobias Vaughn (Kevin Stoney) to invade Earth. Their invasion is defeated by the Doctor and the military support of the newly formed United Nations Intelligence Taskforce."]}, {"page": "The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)", "response": ["A number of actors appeared in supporting roles in most episodes: in series 1 these included: Victor Woolf, Willoughby Gray, and John Longden, and for later series included: Paul Hansard, Morris Barry, Nigel Davenport, Kevin Stoney, Ronald Hines, and Max Faulkner, who also did stunt/double work.

In this form, it became well known for taking a generally critical tone towards the later seasons of the programme, particularly the work of producer John Nathan-Turner, who was subjected to several personal attacks in its pages. However, it became popular with some fans due to its frequent reporting of news concerning the show before it was released through official sources, and as an alternative viewpoint to the officially sanctioned Doctor Who Magazine or Celestial Toyroom, the newsletter of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society. There were, however, occasional embarrassing errors, such as the printing of an obituary for actor Kevin Stoney in 1986, who was still alive and after the article's appearance would happily sign copies for fans at conventions.
