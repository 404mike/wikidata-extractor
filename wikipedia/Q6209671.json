The performance of centre back Richard Hinds saw him named in the Football League One Team of the Week for the second time in three weeks. The Football League Trophy match against Bristol Rovers saw a sluggish performance from Yeovil but despite a red card for captain Jamie McAllister, for an off the ball incident with former team-mate David Clarkson, Yeovil won 3\u20130 with two goals from free-kicks from Ed Upson and a first goal for Sam Foley proving the difference. The club also received a team performance of the round award for their victory over Bristol Rovers. On 8 September, on Soccer AM, Yeovil were drawn away against Torquay United in the second round of the Football League Trophy, later in the day saw a tired performance in the club's first league defeat 1\u20130 at home against Bournemouth. On 15 September, Norwich City midfielder Korey Smith joined Yeovil on an emergency loan deal for the maximum period of 93 days, he made his debut as a substitute that afternoon in the 1\u20130 away defeat against MK Dons as Yeovil slipped to a second consecutive defeat. The following Tuesday saw Yeovil travel to play Leyton Orient and with a frail defensive display Yeovil suffered a heavy 4\u20131 defeat, with the only positive a first league goal for Sam Foley and slipped to 11th in the table. On 21 September, versatile full\u2013back Joe Edwards, who had a loan spell with the club last season, resigned from Bristol City on loan. Yeovil's dismal form continued with another home defeat this time a 1\u20130 reverse against Sheffield United, on 22 September. On 25 September, Rohan Ince returned to Chelsea following an unsuccessful loan spell, but signed 6\u00a0ft 6in defender Dan Burn from Fulham on a youth loan deal for an initial month . Despite taking a sixth minute lead through a Gavin Williams penalty against Preston North End more poor defending and the sending off of midfielder Ed Upson led to a second half turnaround and a 3\u20132 defeat, with debutante Dan Burn scoring at both ends. This defeat saw Yeovil finish the month of September setting a new unwanted club record in the Football League for most consecutive defeats.", "Yeovil's dismal run of form continued into October, and despite a Reuben Reid penalty the club suffered a 2\u20131 home defeat against Portsmouth, their sixth consecutive defeat as the club slid to 16th in the League One table. The game proved more costly for Yeovil than merely a defeat with injuries to both Lewis Young, ankle ligament damage and Gozie Ugwu, recurrence of a hamstring injury, ruling them both out for the month of October, in an attempt to arrest this run of form and as cover for those injuries, on 4 October, Gary Johnson completed the loan signing of Republic of Ireland U21 striker Paddy Madden from Carlisle United. The move worked with immediate effect with Madden scoring a brace on his debut and Hayter adding a third in a 3\u20131 victory over Colchester United. The poor run of form though was reflected by the Colchester United match being the club's lowest ever Football League attendance of just 3,002. This improved performance led to a double nomination in the Football League's Team of the Week with Irish duo Madden and winger Sam Foley both represented. On 9 October, Yeovil's away Football League Trophy tie against Torquay United was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Plainmoor, with the match rescheduled for the following week on the following Saturday the winner of the tie was given the reward of a home Area Quarter-final tie against Wycombe Wanderers in the next round. Another encouraging performance away at league leaders Tranmere Rovers saw Yeovil take a 2\u20130 lead after half an hour thanks to goals from Madden and Foley, but another second half collapse saw Tranmere comeback to win the game 3\u20132 with Yeovil's plight not aided by having Joe Edwards sent off for two yellow cards. In their rearranged tie on 16 October, Yeovil salvaged a 2\u20132 draw against Torquay United with a stoppage time equaliser from James Hayter, to add to his earlier goal, with Yeovil winning the tie 5\u20134 on penalties, having scored all five of their spot kicks and keeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch having saved Torquay's Thomas Cruise's effort. The victory confirming Yeovil's progress to the Area Quarter-final stage of the Football League Trophy, for the first time in five years, with a home tie against Wycombe Wanderers. An unconvincing 2\u20131 victory over a ten-man Bury followed courtesy of goals from Byron Webster and Foley, the performance of midfielder Korey Smith earned him recognition in the League One Team of the Week. That weekend in the draw for the FA Cup First Round Proper Yeovil were given an away tie against fellow League One side Preston North End, to be played on 3 November.

Gary Johnson also did not rule out a permanent deal for the Carlisle striker suggesting it was part of the discussions to extend his loan deal. On 3 November, Yeovil's FA Cup ended with a first round away defeat at Preston North End. The 3\u20130 lacklustre defeat was not helped by the sending off of Ed Upson, who coincidentally was sent off in the corresponding league fixture in September. Yeovil's three game winning run in the league came to an abrupt end with a 3\u20131 home defeat against high flying Stevenage despite a further goal by inform loan striker Paddy Madden early in the first half.

The same day youth team goalkeeper Matt Cafer joined Sherborne Town on a work-experience loan deal. Luke Ayling's performance in the victory over Hartlepool United led to his inclusion in the Football League Team of the Week. Yeovil's inconsistent form continued throughout November with a 4\u20131 defeat at the hands of Swindon Town, including a goal from former striker Andy Williams, followed, on 20 November, by an impressive 1\u20130 away win against Cralwey Town.

The same day Yeovil faced Notts County at home and despite multiple chances and saves forced from visiting keeper Bartosz Bia\u0142kowski were forced to be content with a 0\u20130 draw. Manager Gary Johnson announced after the match that Watford defender Dale Bennett had returned to his parent club a month early after just one substitute appearance due to a back injury. On 15 December, Yeovil faced an away game against Walsall and recovered from 2\u20130 down to draw thanks to a goal from substitute Reuben Reid and a last minute equaliser from Sam Foley. For the Football League Trophy tie with Leyton Orient in January the club offer fans free transport to the match in an attempt to get 500 away travelling supporters, with these coaches funded by the chairman John Fry, joint owner Norman Hayward, directors, vice-presidents, manager Gary Johnson and the playing squad. On 22 December, despite conceding the opening goal in only the third minute against Oldham Athletic the team turned the game around thanks to two goals from Gavin Williams, the second a superb 30-yard strike, and two late goals from Hayter and Madden seeing Yeovil to a 4\u20131 victory their largest home victory of the season. Yeovil's Boxing Day fixture saw them face a short trip to Bournemouth without Foley with a hamstring injury and Korey Smith and Joe Edwards both of whom had returned to their parent clubs due to their loan spells having been completed, a stretched squad suffered a 3\u20130 reverse. Following the game Johnson confirmed that the January transfer window would see an overhaul of the squad with the hope of helping Yeovil move up the table in the second half of the season, Johnson confirmed two of these signing would be likely to be the permanent acquisition of Paddy Madden and the signing of Irish trialist Kevin Dawson.

Defender Byron Webster received recognition for his goal and impressive performance in the League One Team of the Week.", "The opening of the January transfer window saw Yeovil complete the free transfer of Irish midfielder Kevin Dawson on a contract until the end of the season from League of Ireland side Shelbourne, the signing came too late for Dawson to be permitted to feature in Yeovil's New Year's Day fixture against Leyton Orient. A brace from Paddy Madden and a goal for top scorer James Hayter led Yeovil to a 3\u20130 victory over Leyton Orient, the result saw Yeovil climb to 9th place in the League One table and to within three points of the play-off positions. Following the game the club confirmed the permanent signing of Carlisle United loanee Madden on two-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee following the completion of his highly successful loan spell scoring nine goals in sixteen appearances for the Glovers. Yeovil completed their third signing of the transfer window with the addition of left sided midfielder Matthew Dolan on a one-month loan deal from Middlesbrough, but the day also saw the departure of left-back Curtis Haynes-Brown on a free transfer to Football Conference side Cambridge United on a free transfer, Haynes-Brown having only appeared in thirteen matches in eighteen months for Yeovil still had six months left to run on his contract. Prior to the Football League Trophy Southern Area semi-final tie against Leyton Orient, Yeovil confirmed that Fulham defender Dan Burn had extended his youth loan until the end of the season with an agreement for a further extension should Yeovil be involved in the play-offs. With the club funding free transport for away fans to travel to Leyton Orient for the Football League Trophy area semi-final the game saw Yeovil supported by 815 travelling fans for the trip to London, but the match ended in disappointment for the away side with a late Dave Mooney header condemning Yeovil to defeat despite having a man advantage for the last fifteen minutes. On 12 January, Yeovil recorded their first victory over Sheffield United, courtesy of a brace from Paddy Madden on his permanent debut for the club.

The result saw Yeovil end the month in seventh place just one position and three points outside the play-offs, the month seeing them win all three of their league matches and top scorer Paddy Madden scoring six goals in just three appearances.

On 4 April, the club announced that it would axe its youth academy at the end of the season, citing expense and a lack of progress on a proposed Huish Park development plan as reasons. This followed the closure of the Centre of Excellence at the end of the 2011\u201312 season which had been closed because the investment and facilities required by the Premier League's Elite Player Performance Plan scheme were not available. On 6 April, Yeovil faced Shrewsbury Town at home and won a tight game 2\u20131 thanks to a James Hayter penalty and a \"stunning solo effort\" from top goalscorer Paddy Madden.
