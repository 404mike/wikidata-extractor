He was a professional footballer for nineteen years, between 1946 and 1964, making 638 appearances in the Football League, and scoring 276 goals. He also won five caps for England national team. He later became a manager at clubs in England, Spain, Portugal, and Greece. His son, Russell, also played professional football throughout the 1970s.\nStarting his career in 1946 with Port Vale, he spent four years with the club, before making a record breaking transfer to West Bromwich Albion. He was one of the best strikers of the 1950s, playing over 400 games, with a ratio of a goal every two games. He lifted the FA Cup in 1954, and helped the club to the FA Charity Shield in 1954, and a second-place finish in the First Division in 1953\u201354. In 1961 he signed with Crystal Palace, where he spent the final four years of his playing career. He helped Palace win promotion out of the Third Division in 1963\u201364.\nHis management career began in 1966 with Wolverhampton Wanderers, as he led Wolves out of the Second Division in 1966\u201367. In 1969, he took up the reins at Spanish club Athletic Bilbao, leading the club to a second-place finish in La Liga in 1969\u201370. In 1972, he was appointed manager of Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon, after one season with the club he moved back to England to manage Walsall for a brief period. In 1977, he spent a short time as manager of West Bromwich Albion. After a spell advising the Saudi Arabia national team, he took charge of Greek club Panathinaikos for a short time in 1980. His last management position was back at West Brom in 1981\u201382, following which he served the club as a coach and scout.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Bromwich Albion F.C.", "response": ["The club were less successful during the reign of Don Howe, and were relegated to Division Two at the end of 1972\u201373,McOwan p. 105. but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player-manager Johnny Giles.McOwan pp. 113\u2013114. Under Ron Atkinson, Albion reached the 1978 FA Cup semi-final but lost to Ipswich Town.McOwan p. 120. In May of that year, Albion became the first English professional team to play in China, going unbeaten on their five-game trip. In 1978\u201379, the team finished third in Division One, their highest placing for over 20 years, and also reached the UEFA Cup quarter-final, where they were defeated by Red Star Belgrade.McOwan pp. 124\u2013127. The team around this time was notable for simultaneously fielding three black players: Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson; and is considered to be an integral part of the acceptance of black footballers in the English leagues. In his second spell as manager, Ronnie Allen guided the team to both domestic cup semi-finals in 1981\u201382.McOwan pp. 136\u2013138. The mid-1980s saw the start of Albion's longest and deepest decline. They were relegated in 1985\u201386 with the worst record in the club's history,McOwan p. 144. beginning a period of 16 years outside the top flight. Five years later, the club were relegated to the Third Division for the first and only time.McOwan p. 154.", "Other notable honours bestowed upon West Brom players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which was presented to Cyrille Regis in 1979. In 1998, Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends, along with Arthur Rowley, Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles. Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, to be joined two years later by Geoff Hurst. Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager. In 1919\u201320, Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One, a feat which has since been repeated by Ronnie Allen, Derek Kevan, Jeff Astle and Tony Brown. Brown, who holds the club records for goals and appearances, was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007."]}, {"page": "Bobby Robson", "response": ["He made his West Brom debut in a 4\u20130 home defeat to Manchester City on 10 March 1956. In 1957\u201358, he was the club's top league goalscorer; his tally of 24 goals included four in a 5\u20131 win against Burnley.Ronnie Allen was the club's top scorer overall, with 28 goals. Often playing as a midfielder, he went on to play 257 matches and score 61 goals for West Brom, and he captained the team for the 1960\u201361 and 1961\u201362 seasons. However, in August 1962, he returned to Fulham after a disagreement with West Brom vice-chairman Jim Gaunt over his salary.Robson states Gaunt was chairman at the time, however he was vice-chairman until 1963. The ongoing dispute over both minimum and maximum wages in the game, instigated by Robson's teammate Jimmy Hill and the Professional Footballers' Association, combined with the birth of Robson's second son, prompted Robson to demand a higher salary. Gaunt refused to negotiate Robson's contract, so Robson placed a transfer request and was sold to Fulham for \u00a320,000 in a deal which doubled his salary. Soon after Robson joined Fulham, the club sold Alan Mullery and Rodney Marsh, meaning Robson's chances of securing any significant honour there were substantially reduced. Robson himself stated, \"In all my time as a footballer, I didn't win a thing.\""]}, {"page": "West Bromwich", "response": ["Notable former players of West Bromwich Albion include Ronnie Allen (who later had two spells as the club's manager), Bryan Robson (who was also later the club's manager), Laurie Cunningham (the first black player to play for the senior England national team, but died in 1989 at age 33), Tony Brown (the club's all-time leading goalscorer) and Jeff Astle (who scored the club's winning goal in the 1968 FA Cup Final and remained a cult figure among Albion fans)."]}, {"page": "Bryan Robson", "response": ["Johnny Giles left Albion at the end of 1976\u201377. His successor, the club's chief scout and former player Ronnie Allen, picked Robson to replace Giles in central midfield. However Allen himself left midway through the season and defender John Wile was put in temporary charge. Results worsened and Robson was dropped from the team.Robson (2007), pp. 33\u201334. He returned to the side under new boss Ron Atkinson, whom Robson described as \"a down-to-earth, fair-minded, regular bloke\". Atkinson did leave Robson out of the FA Cup semi-final defeat against Ipswich Town, but recalled him for the latter stages of the league campaign as Albion qualified for the UEFA Cup. In 1978\u201379 Robson was a key player, starting 41 out of 42 league games and wearing the number 7 shirt on each occasion. He played a major part in Albion finishing third in Division One, their highest league placing for more than 20 years, and reaching the UEFA Cup quarter-finals. The following season was a disappointing one by comparison, with the club finishing only 10th in the league, but Robson's performances in midfield helped to earn him his first full England cap in February 1980. In 1980\u201381 he scored ten goals in 40 league games to help Albion to a 4th-place finish in the First Division."]}, {"page": "Football records and statistics in England", "response": ["|  Ronnie Allen "]}, {"page": "Cyrille Regis", "response": ["Regis was spotted by West Bromwich Albion's chief scout Ronnie Allen, who recommended that the First Division club should sign him. With the Albion directors unsure of paying a four-figure fee for such a young, unproven player, Allen offered to fund any initial payment from his own pocket, so sure was he that Regis would make it in the top tier of English football. The transfer took place in May 1977, for an up-front fee of \u00a35,000, plus another \u00a35,000 after 20 appearances.Matthews (2002), pp. 17\u201321.", "Regis also scored in his first FA Cup match in January 1978, helping Albion to beat Blackpool 4\u20131.
