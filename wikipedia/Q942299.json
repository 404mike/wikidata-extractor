The society was housed by Full Street Public Baths but it was a private society funded by its members' subscriptions. Its collections were created by donations initially from Dr Forrester who had been a President of Derby Philosophical Society. The patron of the Museum Society was William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, and the President was Sir George Crewe who was a keen naturalist. Col. George Gawler contributed a collection of minerals and exotic stuffed birds which included an albatross from his time as governor in South Australia. In 1839 a major exhibition was held at the Mechanics' Institute which contained many items including those from Joseph Strutt's collection. Many of these made their way into Derby Museum's collection. The society moved in 1840 to the Athenaeum in Victoria Street. The society's collections grew in 1856 and they were first offered for incorporation into the town by William Mundy, but the offer was rejected."]}, {"page": "South Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|William Mundy || Conservative", "|William Mundy || Conservative"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Mundy||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Francis Noel Clarke Mundy", "response": ["In addition there is an engraving of him with his grandson, William Mundy, by Charles Turner (after R.
