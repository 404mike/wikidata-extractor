He studied composition with the Viennese \u00e9migr\u00e9 Hans Heimler (a pupil of Alban Berg) and then at the Royal Academy of Music, London.\nFrancis Brown's significant chamber works include sonatas for Piano (1994), for Viola (1995), the String Trio (commissioned by the Leopold String Trio, 1996) and a Piano Quartet (2003). Larger concert works include the Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra (premiered by Jack Liebeck and the English Chamber Orchestra at the Barbican Centre in 2001), the Sinfonietta, commissioned by Faber Music and premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in 2002 by the London Chamber Orchestra, Trio Concertante for string trio and orchestra (2006) and the Clarinet Concerto (2008). The Shakespeare-inspired \u2018Prospero\u2019s Isle\u2019 (2006), is a work for cello and piano that was subsequently expanded and orchestrated to form a symphonic tone poem, arranged for performance in St Petersburg in 2007. Brown's String Quartet was written in 2010 and premiered at a London Chamber Music Society concert that same year. Songs of Nature and Farewell is written for the combination of Soprano, Flute, Cello, and piano (after the composer Maurice Ravel's Chansons Mad\u00e9casses)As an arranger he reconstructed and orchestrated sketches for Wagner's projected opera 'M\u00e4nnerlist gr\u00f6\u00dfer als Frauenlist' for the Royal Opera House in 2007 and arranged Wagner's Siegfried Idyll for the 2008 City of London Festival. His film scores include the acclaimed short film \u201cThe Clap\u201d (Breakthru Films, 2005).\nJames Francis Brown was awarded a five-year NESTA fellowship in 2003, and was the first composer-in-residence at the International Musicians Seminar, Prussia Cove, in 2006. In 2009 he was Composer in Residence at the Ulverston Festival in England's Lake District.\nHis concert work is often linked with a group of British composers called 'Music Haven', not a school as such, but a collection of composers (c.f. the French 'Les Six' or the British 'Manchester School', from the early and late twentieth-century respectively), mostly London-based and with broadly similar interests and aesthetic outlook, reflecting sympathies for British masters such as Britten and Tippett and the great music of the First Viennese School, especially Haydn and Beethoven, as well as the Scandinavian influences of Sibelius and Nielsen. The group includes Peter Fribbins, Northern Irish-born Alan Mills, Matthew Taylor, John Hawkins, Geoff Palmer, and more peripherally two older British composers, David Matthews and by association, John McCabe CBE. The set of piano pieces 'Seven Haydn Fantasies for John McCabe' - each composed by a different composer and published in 2009 on the occasion of the latter's 70th birthday - is in many ways typical of the group's work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Piano quartet", "response": ["*James Francis Brown"]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|James Francis Brown || 1969 ||  || British ||  ||"]}, {"page": "List of string quartet composers", "response": ["*James Francis Brown (born 1969): One string quartet (2010).Tirimo, F.
