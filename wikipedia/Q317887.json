His poetry is associated with the writings of the metaphysical poets, and he is recognised as \"one of the foremost British devotional lyricists.\" He was born into an artistic and wealthy family and largely raised in England. He received a good education that led to his admission to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1609. He went there with the intention of becoming a priest, but he became the University's Public Orator and attracted the attention of King James I. He served in the Parliament of England in 1624 and briefly in 1625.After the death of King James, Herbert renewed his interest in ordination. He gave up his secular ambitions in his mid-thirties and took holy orders in the Church of England, spending the rest of his life as the rector of the rural parish of Fugglestone St Peter, just outside Salisbury. He was noted for unfailing care for his parishioners, bringing the sacraments to them when they were ill and providing food and clothing for those in need. Henry Vaughan called him \"a most glorious saint and seer\". He was never a healthy man and died of consumption at age 39.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 3", "response": ["*1593 \u2013 George Herbert, English poet (d. 1633)"]}, {"page": "Book of Common Prayer", "response": ["Among Cranmer's innovations, retained in the new book was the requirement of weekly Holy Communion services. In practice, as before the English Reformation, many received communion rarely, as little as once a year in some cases; George Herbert estimated it as no more than six times. Practice, however, varied from place to place: very high attendance at festivals was the order of the day in many parishes and in some regular communion was very popular, in other places families stayed away or sent \"a servant to be the liturgical representative of their household.\" Few parish clergy were initially licensed by the bishops to preach; in the absence of a licensed preacher, Sunday services were required to be accompanied by reading one of the homilies written by Cranmer. George Herbert was, however, not alone in his enthusiasm for preaching, which he regarded as one of the prime functions of a parish priest. Music was much simplified and a radical distinction developed between, on the one hand, parish worship where only the metrical psalms of Sternhold and Hopkins might be sung and, on the other hand, worship in churches with organs and surviving choral foundations, where the music of John Marbeck and others was developed into a rich choral tradition The whole act of parish worship might take well over two hours; and accordingly, churches were equipped with pews in which households could sit together (whereas in the medieval church, men and women had worshipped separately). Diarmaid MacCulloch describes the new act of worship as, \"a morning marathon of prayer, scripture reading, and praise, consisting of mattins, litany, and ante-communion, preferably as the matrix for a sermon to proclaim the message of scripture anew week by week.\""]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*George Herbert (1593\u20131632, W)"]}, {"page": "February 27", "response": ["*  1863   \u2013 George Herbert Mead, American sociologist and philosopher (d. 1930)", "**George Herbert (Anglicanism)"]}, {"page": "Isaac Newton", "response": ["Two writers think that the above quotation, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke (said to have been short and hunchbacked), rather than\u2014or in addition to\u2014a statement of modesty.John Gribbin (2002) Science: A History 1543\u20132001, p. 164.

He is known mainly for religious poetry published in Silex Scintillans in 1650, with a second part in 1655.Oxford Companion to English Literature, s. v. Henry Vaughan In 1646 his poems appeared with the Tenth Satyre of Juvenal Englished, followed by a second volume in 1647. Meanwhile, he had been persuaded by reading the religious poet George Herbert to renounce \"idle verse\". The prose Mount of Olives and Solitary Devotions (1652) show his authenticity and the depth of his convictions. Two more volumes of secular verse followed, ostensibly without his sanction, but it is his religious verse that has been acclaimed. He also translated short moral and religious works and two medical works in prose. In the 1650s he began a lifelong medical practice.Britannica. Retrieved 24 November 2018.", "Vaughan was kin to two powerful Welsh families, one Catholic and one Protestant. His paternal grandfather, William, owned Tretower Court. His paternal grandmother, Frances, was the natural daughter of Thomas Somerset, who spent some 24 years in the Tower of London for adhering to Catholicism. As she survived into Vaughan's boyhood, there may have been some direct Catholic influence on his early nurturing. Vaughan shared ancestry with the Herbert family through the daughter of a famous Welsh knight, Dafydd Gam, slain at Agincourt, the \"Davy Gam, esquire\" of William Shakespeare's Henry V. He is not known to have claimed kinship with George Herbert, but may have been aware of the tie.", "It was not until the writing of Silex Scintillans that Vaughan received significant acclaim. The period shortly preceding the publication of the first volume of this work (1650) marked an important period of his life. Certain indications in the first volume and explicit statements in the preface to the second volume (1655) suggest that Vaughan suffered a prolonged sickness that inflicted much pain. Vaughan interprets this experience to be an encounter with death that alerted him to a \"misspent youth\". Vaughan believed he had been spared to make amends and start a new course not only in his life but in the literature he would produce. He described his previous work as foul and a contribution to \"corrupt literature\". Perhaps the most notable mark of Vaughan's conversion is how much it is credited to George Herbert. Vaughan claims he is the least of Herbert's many \"pious converts\". It was during this period of Vaughan's life, around 1650, that he adopted the saying \"moriendo, revixi\" \u2013 \"by dying, I gain new life\".", "Vaughan was much indebted to George Herbert, who provided a model for Vaughan's new-found spiritual life and literary career, showing a \"spiritual quickening and the gift of gracious feeling\" derived from Herbert.", "Archbishop Trench took the view, \"As a divine Vaughan may be inferior [to Herbert], but as a poet he is certainly superior.\" Critics praise Vaughan's use of literary elements. His monosyllables and long-drawn alliterations, and his ability to compel the reader to place him as \"more than the equal of George Herbert\". Yet others say the two are not even comparable, as Herbert is in fact the Master. While these commentators admit that Henry Vaughan's use of words can be superior to Herbert's, they believe his poetry is, in fact, worse. Herbert's profundity as well as consistency are said to be the key to his superiority.", "Another work of Vaughan's that parallels George Herbert is Mount of Olives, for example in the passage, \"Let sensual natures judge as they please, but for my part, I shall hold it no paradoxe to affirme, there are no pleasures in the world. Some coloured griefes of blushing woes there are, which look as clear as if they were true complexions; but it is very sad and tyred truth, that they are but painted.\" This echoes Herbert's Rose:", "*F.

His leisurely labours as a biographer seem to have grown out of his devotion to angling. It was probably as an angler that he made the acquaintance of Sir Henry Wotton, but it is clear that Walton had more than a love of fishing and a humorous temper to recommend him to the friendship of the accomplished ambassador. At any rate, Wotton, who had intended to write the life of John Donne, and had already corresponded with Walton on the subject, left the task to him. Walton had already contributed an elegy to the 1633 edition of Donne's poems, and he completed and published the life, much to the satisfaction of the most learned critics, in 1640. Sir Henry Wotton dying in 1639, Walton undertook his life also; it was finished in 1642 and published in 1651 as a preface to the volume Reliquiae Wottonianae. His life of Hooker was published in 1665, and his biography of George Herbert in 1670, the latter coinciding with a collected edition of Walton's biographical writings, The Lives of Dr. John Donne, Sir Henry Wotton, Mr. Richard Hooker, Mr. George Herbert (1670, 1675).
