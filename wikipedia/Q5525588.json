He turned professional on 23 March 1978, but despite being a regular in the club's reserve team, he could not break into the first team and signed for Queens Park Rangers on 4 July 1979. He came on a free transfer, signed by former United boss Tommy Docherty, and made his debut in a 2-0 win against Blackburn Rovers in October 1981. Micklewhite came on as a substitute for Clive Allen in the 1982 FA Cup Final and started the replay, scoring a goal which was disallowed. In all, Micklewhite played 97 league games scoring 11 goals for QPR before moving to Derby County in 1985.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1982 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The first game was a tense and largely dull game of few clear cut chances. QPR's young goalkeeper Peter Hucker was certainly the busier keeper although Spurs were mainly being kept to long range efforts. Hucker's performance in the first match would ultimately earn him the Man of the Match award. QPR were not outclassed however, although their attacking options were hindered when prolific striker Clive Allen, who had scored the winner in the semi-final, was injured early in the game and was a peripheral figure thereafter. He was replaced by Gary Micklewhite five minutes into the second half. Ninety minutes came and went with the score 0\u20130. With ten minutes of extra time remaining, Glenn Hoddle found himself just outside the QPR penalty box. His shot took a deflection (off Tony Currie) and found the right-hand corner of Hucker's goal. Not to be outdone, five minutes later Simon Stainrod took a long throw ten yards from the Spurs goal line. Rangers' burly centre-back Bob Hazell, flicked the ball on at the near post and Terry Fenwick headed the ball past Spurs keeper Ray Clemence at point-blank range, making the final score 1\u20131.", "The replay took place at Wembley five days later. Clive Allen had not recovered from his injury and his replacement on the Saturday, Gary Micklewhite, started the game. Early in the game after only six minutes had elapsed, the Spurs midfielder Graham Roberts broke through into the Rangers penalty area. Rangers' captain on the evening, Tony Currie (regular captain Glenn Roeder was suspended), made a lunge to get the ball but only succeeded in bringing Roberts down. It was a clear penalty. Glenn Hoddle coolly slotted the penalty away sending Peter Hucker the wrong way. QPR soon managed to get into the game though and before long had the ball in the net by Micklewhite, but the goal was disallowed for an offside against Stainrod. It was fair to say that for  much of the rest of the game they were the better side, taking the game to their more highly fancied opponents. The only thing they could not manage to do was score. The closest they came was in the second half when John Gregory received a raking long pass from the left wing from Simon Stainrod and spotted Spurs keeper Ray Clemence slightly off his line. Gregory's audacious volleyed chip from just inside the box however, agonisingly hit the crossbar and bounced to safety. Steve Archibald hit the post late on for Spurs but Hoddle's early penalty remained the only goal, and Spurs retained the trophy just as they had done in 1962. Spurs became the only team to win three FA Cup Final replays, as well as the only team to win FA Cup Final replays in successive years.", "|MF ||12||  Gary Micklewhite ", "|CF ||9 || Gary Micklewhite "]}, {"page": "Micklewhite", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gary Micklewhite"]}, {"page": "History of Derby County F.C. (1967\u2013present)", "response": ["Whilst Derby were now under the control of the Maxwell family, with Ian as chairman whilst Robert remained in charge at Oxford United, Cox entered a club finally run with backroom stability if not exactly limitless funds. The 1984\u201385 season was one of transition and, although the club only managed a 7th-placed finish \u2013 the lowest league placing in the club's history \u2013 the foundations for the next five years of success were being laid, with Rob Hindmarch, Charlie Palmer and Eric Steele were bought in for free whilst the sale of Kevin Wilson for \u00a3150,000 to Ipswich Town helped fund moves for Trevor Christie, Gary Micklewhite and Geraint Williams. Of the players at the club when Cox arrive, the key man was Peter Taylor signing Bobby Davison, who became the first Derby player to hit 20 league goals in a single campaign since Kevin Hector in 1967\u201368 when he hit 24 goals in 46 matches to finish as the club's leading scorer for the third consecutive season.thumb|left|Arthur Cox", "The following season Davison was again top scorer and, alongside new signings such as Jeff Chandler, Ross McLaren and future-England manager Steve McLaren and John Gregory, helped the club earn promotion for the third tier at the second attempt, setting the club record of 84 points in a season from 3 points for a win, as they finished third in the 1985\u201386 Third Division, recording some big wins along the way; a 7\u20130 win over Lincoln City was the club's biggest league win since before World War I. With a 46-game league programme, a run to the FA Cup fifth round, which included a 6\u20131 win over Telford United, the League Cup 3rd Round and participation in the Associate Members' Cup's Southern Qualifying Group, Derby played 60 competitive matches between 17 August 1985 and 12 May 1986, a club record, with Steve Buckley, Ross McLaren and Gary Micklewhite taking part in 58 games each. A buoyant feeling had returned to The Baseball Ground, and Cox was in his pomp, shaping a tightly knit group of players who each knew their jobs and respected each other which was supplemented with considered signings such as Phil Gee from Gresley Rovers and Nigel Callaghan from Watford. Following promotion the club won the 1986\u201387 Second Division at a canter, 6 points ahead of second placed Portsmouth and equalled the previous season's record of 84 points, though this was taken from 42 rather than 46 fixtures. After an opening day home defeat by Oldham Athletic the club went unbeaten at The Baseball Ground in the league for the rest of the season. Bobby Davison (who finished top league scorer for the fifth season on a row, with 19 strikes, taking his league tally to 82 in 5 years) and Phil Gee grabbed 32 goals between them, half of Derby's total, and Cox's team set a club record with 11 away league victories to secure a return to top-flight football after a traumatic seven years away."]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["The club's players and officials celebrated promotion with an open-top bus parade through the streets of Rochester, Chatham, and Gillingham. Following promotion, Pulis again overhauled his squad ahead of the upcoming season in the Second Division, and several players who had played significant roles in the 1995\u201396 season moved on.  Martin, who had captained the team to promotion, and Naylor both left the club after a single season and joined Leyton Orient.   Gary Micklewhite, one of the few players to have been with the club before Pulis' arrival and to have remained a regular in the team during the 1995\u201396 season, retired from professional football and joined non-League club Slough Town.  Gillingham signed a number of new players, including spending a new club record fee to sign Watford's Andy Hessenthaler, who would go on to have a long association with the club as player and subsequently manager.  In the 1996\u201397 season, the team secured a mid-table finish in their first season at the higher level, finishing 11th in the Second Division."]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Micklewhite"]}, {"page": "Micklewhite, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Micklewhite"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["In July, Glenn Roeder resigned as the club's manager to take the equivalent role at Watford of the First Division, one of the clubs for which he had played.
