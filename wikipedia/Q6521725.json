Clark was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace.  He was born at Manor Park, Essex.\nClark made his first-class debut for Essex against Derbyshire in 1946 County Championship.  He made 23 further first-class appearances for the county, the last of which came against Glamorgan in the 1947 County Championship.  In his 24 first-class appearances, he scored 745 runs at an average of 18.17, with a high score of 64.  This score, which was one of four fifties he made, came against Northamptonshire in 1947.He died at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on 2 May 2000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["The Essex v Northamptonshire match was played at Valentines Park, Ilford 17 to 20 May. Northamptonshire won the toss and decided to bat, scoring 215 all out with a top score of 49 by Vince Broderick while Essex's Test leg break and googly bowler Peter Smith took four for 65. By close of play on Saturday, Essex had replied to 170 for 4 with opener Chick Cray on 90 not out. He completed his century, exactly 100, on Monday morning and Essex went on to total 267 all out. Northamptonshire were 219 for 5 at the close on Monday evening with their veteran batsman John Timms on 90 not out. Timms was out for 112 on Tuesday morning and Peter Smith completed ten in the match by taking six for 84 in the Northamptonshire total of 291. Essex therefore needed 240 to win with ample time left on the final day. They had a good stand of 103 for the fourth wicket between Frank Vigar (60) and Len Clark (64) but spinners Broderick and Bertie Clarke kept picking up the wickets and Essex were still ten behind when the ninth went down. The last pair were captain Tom Pearce and wicketkeeper Tom Wade who managed to level the scores before Wade was bowled by Clarke to tie the match.CricketArchive \u2013 Essex v Northamptonshire 1947. Retrieved 30 October 2013.", "Essex matches were noted for high scores as Essex themselves scored more runs than anyone except Middlesex but also conceded the most. Their two outstanding players were the cousins Peter and Ray Smith who both completed the double. These two, bowling leg break and off break respectively, effectively carried the Essex attack. Outstanding prospect Trevor Bailey was the sole pace bowler of any effect but he was only available in the latter half of the season and then injuries limited his bowling, though he topped the county's batting averages. The other all-rounder Frank Vigar took 59 championship wickets bowling leg breaks but was expensive. Bailey, Vigar and the Smiths were half of the eight Essex players who scored 1,000 runs in the season, the other four being captain Tom Pearce, Chick Cray, Dickie Dodds and Doug Insole. Wicketkeeper Tom Wade had a very good season with 77 victims, 38 of them stumped. Essex were also represented by Bill Dines, Bill Morris, Denys Wilcox, Dick Horsfall, Frank Rist, Harry Crabtree, Len Clark and Sonny Avery.Playfair, pp. 100\u2013102."]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Len Clark 64"]}, {"page": "Len Clark", "response": ["Len Clark may refer to:", "*Len Clark (cricketer)", "*Len Clark (footballer)", "*Len Clark (countryside campaigner)", "*Len Clarke, Australian rules footballer"]}]}}
