He succeeded Charles Jasper Joly at the post and was appointed upon recommendation from the astronomer Robert Stawell Ball. Ball's recommendation, which was published in a collection of his letters in 1915, stated that Whittaker was the only person he knew who could \"properly succeed Joly\" and that the role would \"suit him in every way\". He then describes Whittaker as \"modest\" and \"charming\" and as \"a man who has infinite capacity for making things go\". Ball claims that Whittaker was a world leading expert in theoretical astronomy and that, in relation to Whittaker's discovery of a general solution to Laplace's equation, notes that he \"has already made one discovery which the greatest mathematician of the last two centuries would be proud to have placed to his credit\". The Royal Astronomers acted as directors for the Dunsink Observatory, which used outdated astronomy equipment; it was understood that the primary responsibility of the role was to teach mathematical physics at Trinity College. During this time, the relative leisure of his post allowed him to complete the reading required to write his third major book A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, from the age of Descartes to the close of the nineteenth century. Also during this time, he wrote the book The Theory of Optical Instruments, published six astronomy papers, and published collected astronomical observations."]}, {"page": "Robert Ball", "response": ["*Robert Stawell Ball (1840\u20131913), Irish astronomer"]}, {"page": "Sir Robert Ball", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Stawell Ball"]}, {"page": "Sir Robert Stawell Ball", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Stawell Ball"]}, {"page": "University Philosophical Society", "response": ["* Robert Stawell Ball, ex-Sch., Royal Astronomer of Ireland and Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at the University of Cambridge.

She was employed by the observatory in 1879 at the age of 15, and remained there for 24 years, working under astronomers John Couch Adams and Robert Stawell Ball. She worked most directly with the observatory's senior assistant at the time, Andrew Graham. The observatory necessitated that only two observers worked at any one time. Up until 1892, Walker substituted for Graham's current assistant Henry Todd when Todd's ill health prevented him from observing. That Walker was making transit observations with the meridian circle in the mid-1880s is clear from an observatory report that stated her work was interrupted by an earth tremor on 22 April 1884, when she had to stop while wires in the eyepiece vibrated. From 1892, Walker became Graham's observation partner and from 1894 to 1896, she observed alone.See page 89 in "]}, {"page": "President of the Royal Astronomical Society", "response": ["| 31 || 100px ||  Robert Stawell Ball || 1897 || 1899 ||  || "]}]}}
