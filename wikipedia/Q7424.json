They worked on the chemical composition of the human body, and on the nutritional value of different flours used to make bread. Widdowson also studied the impact of infant diet on human growth. They studied the differing effects from deficiencies of salt and of water and produced the first tables to compare the nutritional contents of foods before and after cooking. They co-authored The Chemical Composition of Foods, first published in 1940 by the Medical Research Council. Their book, \"McCance and Widdowson\", became known as the dietician's bible and formed the basis for modern nutritional thinking."]}, {"page": "1940 in science", "response": ["* Robert McCance and Elsie Widdowson publish the standard text The Chemical Composition of Foods.

Using 1938 food production data, they fed themselves and other volunteers one egg,  of meat and  of fish a week;  of milk a day;  of margarine; and unlimited amounts of potatoes, vegetables and wholemeal bread. Two weeks of intensive outdoor exercise simulated the strenuous wartime physical work Britons would likely have to perform. The scientists found that the subjects' health and performance remained very good after three months; the only negative results were the increased time needed for meals to consume the necessary calories from bread and potatoes, and what they described as a \"remarkable\" increase in flatulence from the large amount of starch in the diet. The scientists also noted that their faeces had increased by 250% in volume."]}, {"page": "Barrington, Cambridgeshire", "response": ["* Elsie Widdowson, dietitian"]}, {"page": "Sydenham School", "response": ["* Elsie Widdowson, dietitian"]}, {"page": "Great Lives", "response": ["|Elsie Widdowson, dietitian"]}, {"page": "List of members of the Order of the Companions of Honour", "response": ["|12 June 1993||||Elsie Widdowson||1906\u20132000||Nutritionist"]}, {"page": "Robert McCance", "response": ["With colleague H.
