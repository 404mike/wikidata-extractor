United played their third home game in a row three days later, and a 1\u20130 scoreline was enough to condemn Carlisle United to a league defeat, meaning the Blades had registered their tenth straight win in all competitions. United's winning run was halted in the next match however, as they were held to a goalless draw away at Preston North End. On 21 March Callum McFadzean joined Burton Albion on a one-month loan, while striker Shaun Miller joined Shrewsbury Town a day later, agreeing a loan until the end of the season.
