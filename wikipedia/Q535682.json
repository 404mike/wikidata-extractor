He writes from an area beyond psychology, where feelings acquire the adamancy of randomly encountered, geologically analyzed pebbles.\" The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung described him as \"the darling of the West German critics.\" Hugo Hamilton stated that, since his debut, Handke \"has tested, inspired and shocked audiences.\" Joshua Cohen noted that Handke \"commands one of the great German-language prose styles of the post-war period, a riverine rhetoric deep and swift and contrary of current,\" while Gabriel Josipovici described him, \"despite reservations about some of his recent work,\" as one of the most significant German-language writers of the post-war era.

Beckett\u2019s successive monologuists, confined to a series of small rooms, try and fail to tell their stories; and each narrator is then revealed to be the alias, and each story the alibi, of its successor, until, pulling all of Beckett\u2019s earlier creations down upon its nonexistent head, there is only the disembodied voice of the Unnamable.\"  In this way, according to Gabriel Josipovici, \"Beckett\u2019s trilogy returns us to oral literature, to an art more honest and more immediate than that of the novel.\" Moreso than elsewhere in the trilogy, the themes of The Unnamable are explicitly spiritual, concerned with the search for the self, the meaning of existence, and the cause and cessation of suffering."]}, {"page": "Terumah (parashah)", "response": ["*Gabriel Josipovici. \"Building the Tabernacle.\" In The Book of God: A Response to the Bible, pages 90\u2013107.
