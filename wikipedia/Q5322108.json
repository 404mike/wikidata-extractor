He also wrote under the pseudonyms Robertson Halkett and Robertson Halket. Primarily writing on crime and deduction, he enjoyed some literary success in the 1930s and 1940s. Today, he is remembered, in the main, as the creator of Police Constable Bobby Owen, the protagonist of many of Punshon's novels, who was eventually promoted to sergeant, inspector, superintendent and, finally, commander. A popular Scotland Yard detective, Owen appeared in 35 novels from 1933 to 1956.  Punshon reviewed many of Agatha Christie's novels for The Guardian on their first publication. Punshon was also a prolific writer of short stories, and a selection of his crime and horror fiction has recently been collected together.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Face on the Cutting-Room Floor", "response": ["When the book was eventually published in 1937, traditionalists and purists of crime fiction felt rather cheated while critics and reviewers such as Milward Kennedy, E. R. Punshon, Ross McLaren and Sir Herbert Read liked the novel for its ingenuity (\"a detective story with a difference\"). Eric Partridge considered it a mine of information on contemporary English slang and quoted extensively from it in his dictionaries. The Face on the Cutting-Room Floor saw eight reprints in various pocket editions and also appeared in French and German translations but was never brought out in the United States."]}, {"page": "Murder in the Mews", "response": ["E.

The last story is disappointing in that it presents an interesting psychological situation that seems to cry aloud for the fuller treatment.
