After an ill-fated attempt to win her back, Steve resigns himself to the fact that she is gone.

Della moves to the square to open a hair salon and coaxes Steve into becoming a partner in the business, named 'Kool for Kutz'.

In 1993, The Independent reported that the character was being written out of EastEnders. Steve was one of several characters to be written out that year in what the press dubbed the \"Albert Square Massacre\". However, as Colin Brake summarised in the book EastEnders: The First 10 Years, \"since like Frank Sinatra [Steve] always seems to make another comeback, perhaps we will list this as a temporary disappearance.\" In the storyline, Steve, faced with an imminent marriage to Hattie which he did not want to commit to, jilted her, not knowing she was pregnant with his child. Actress Michelle Gayle quit the serial towards the end of 1993, and Steve was used in an unrequited-lust storyline with a new character, Della Alexander (Michelle Joseph) upon his return early in 1994. Initially, writers lead the audience to believe that Della was designed to be a new love interest for Steve, however as the plot developed it was revealed that she was actually the soap's first lesbian character."]}, {"page": "Binnie Roberts", "response": ["Binnie Roberts is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Sophie Langham from 9 June 1994 until 16 May 1995.
