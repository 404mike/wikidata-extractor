He also played as a professional for Oldham Athletic, Stockport County, Bury, Chesterfield, Guiseley and Altrincham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["Slade's Assistant Graham Rodger was his replacement but by November he had been dismissed following a poor start to the season, he was replaced by Alan Buckley who arrived back with The Mariners for a third time but could only produce a bottom half finish in League Two. During the 2007\u201308 season the club enjoyed a good run in the Football League Trophy and on 4 March 2008 Grimsby booked their place at the new Wembley Stadium after beating Morecambe in a two-legged Northern Final. A Paul Bolland goal in the away first leg was enough to see Town through. They went on to play MK Dons in the Final on 30 March, losing 2\u20130 after Danny Boshell missed an early penalty. The season ended with eight straight defeats. After a 13\u2013game winless streak in the league stretching from 22 March 2008, on 15 September 2008 Alan Buckley was sacked as manager for a second time. The board appointed Mike Newell as manager. The Mariners would finish 22nd in League Two narrowly avoiding relegation on the final day. Following another slow start to the season, and despite previous backings from the Grimsby Town board, on 18 October 2009 the club's official website declared they had sacked Mike Newell due to \"irretrievable breakdown\". Neil Woods was controversially made permanent manager on 23 November 2009. The other main candidate for the job was former boss Russell Slade, but the board decided upon Woods ahead of Slade. Almost immediately Woods was dealt a blow when the club decided to do a U-turn and sell captain Ryan Bennett to Peterborough United for \u00a3500,000 despite rejecting this offer in the summer and the player only recently signing a new four-year deal. Grimsby under Woods struggled and despite winning four and drawing one of their last six games to give them a chance of league survival going into the last game of the season., they were defeated 3\u20130 by Burton Albion, and thus were relegated from the Football League for the first time in nearly 100 years."]}, {"page": "Matthew Heywood", "response": ["On 25 June 2008, Heywood turned down a fresh contract at Griffin Park, and signed a two-year contract with Grimsby Town. He was named Grimsby's club captain for the 2008\u201309 season by his new manager Alan Buckley, but the Mariners began to struggle in the league, and Buckley was dismissed early on into the new campaign. Following increasingly worrying poor performances from Heywood, Buckley's replacement as manager, Mike Newell opted to re-sign former Grimsby centre back Rob Atkinson to replace Matt in defence. The club captaincy was also given to youngster Ryan Bennett. Heywood would only make 18 appearances for Grimsby in his first season and spent a good chunk of that sat on the substitutes bench. During the 2009\u201310 season, Heywood continued to struggle in the sense of finding any way into the first-team, and failed to even make the bench on a regular basis, even under the club's new manager Neil Woods. On 13 January 2010, Woods told Heywood, along with Danny Boshell, Barry Conlon and Jamie Clarke that they were free to leave the club in the January transfer window, this following Heywood only featuring once in the season, playing in a 4\u20130 away defeat against Port Vale in September 2009. On 1 February 2010, Heywood along with Clarke and Boshell were released from the club."]}, {"page": "Barry Conlon", "response": ["Following the conclusion of the 2008\u201309 campaign, he was released by Bradford, and shortly afterwards he signed for Grimsby permanently on a two-year contract. Conlon's season began on a plus point, scoring on the opening day game with Cheltenham Town, but he soon lost his place in the first team due to two red cards in three games which left him suspended for seven matches, in which his team seemingly struggled too find an adequate replacement who could find the back of the net. Following the dismissal of manager Mike Newell, Conlon found himself out of favour with new manager Neil Woods often using him as a substitute. He was also relegated to the reserves, and spent one night in a police station cell because of driving offences only hours before a reserve fixture with Scunthorpe United. On 13 January 2010, Woods told Conlon, along with Danny Boshell, Matthew Heywood and Jamie Clarke, that they were free to leave the club in the January transfer window. On 1 March 2010, over a month since Conlon's Grimsby departure, the club held a fans forum giving a chance for the supporters to voice recent club concerns with chairman John Fenty and manager Neil Woods. Conlon's release to Chesterfield had been slightly criticised by some supporters because of the fact he was the Grimsby's current seasonal top goalscorer, and was seemingly the only proven goal scorer in the ranks at Blundell Park. Fenty was asked by a supporter during the forum why Conlon was allowed to leave. Fenty answered that Conlon had become a disruptive influence, having failed to turn up for training and not answered phone calls from the club. Conlon later admitted that after an enjoyable loan spell with Grimsby his \"heart wasn't in it\" when he signed permanently for the club and that his commuting from his Leeds home had left him exhausted. He also claimed that new manager Neil Woods was \"clueless\"."]}, {"page": "Jamie Clarke (footballer, born 1982)", "response": ["Only a few weeks after the end of the 2006\u201307 season, Clarke was the first new face in at Grimsby Town for the 2007\u201308 campaign. Manager Alan Buckley brought him in as the club's new right back, to cater for the vacant spot left by retiring and long serving legend John McDermott. Despite this, Clarke was also deployed in midfield during his first season. He managed to make an appearance at Wembley Stadium for the club, as they lost 2\u20130 to Milton Keynes Dons in the Final of the Football League Trophy. In the 2008\u201309 season, Buckley signed Robbie Stockdale as the club's first choice right back, giving Clarke an uphill struggle to claim a place in the team. His adopted midfield role was his main role throughout the season. However, when Buckley was sacked, his replacement Mike Newell opted to bring in fresh faces in both defence and midfield, making several players come ahead of Clarke in the pecking order. Clarke eventually would only be called upon in the event of illness or injury. At the end of the season, Newell commented on BBC Radio Humberside that Clarke as well as fellow utility player Danny Boshell may still be offered a fresh deal, and Clarke put pen to paper to sign a fresh one-year deal a week later. On 13 January 2010, new manager Neil Woods told Clarke, along with Danny Boshell, Matthew Heywood and Barry Conlon that they were free to leave the club in the January transfer window.
