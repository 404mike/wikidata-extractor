We believe that public services are best delivered locally so taxpayers can hold local representatives to account for what happens in their community.\"  Rhodri Glyn Thomas, for Plaid Cymru, commented: \"The weight of evidence presented to the Williams Commission shows that if the people of Wales are going to get the services they need and deserve then there has to be a radical improvement in the way public services are delivered.\""]}, {"page": "Wales Millennium Centre", "response": ["The National Assembly for Wales announced on 6 November 2007 that it was to pay off the outstanding loan of \u00a313.5\u00a0million from HSBC and also increase the annual funding.
