Still, the girls' vocal performances are integral, and the band's Tony Lundon is playing an increasingly major writing role: his untypical \"Watcha Doin' Tonite\" hardly pines for lives they've now clearly left behind.\""]}, {"page": "1979 in British music", "response": ["*13 April - Tony Lundon, Irish singer (Liberty X)"]}, {"page": "X (Liberty X song)", "response": ["\"X\" is a song by English-Irish pop group Liberty X.
