Specialist schools were found to have admitted less people from a poorer background, however Gorard was unable to confirm if the increase of specialist schools linked to greater segregation. It was also found that former church and grant-maintained schools with specialist status were more strongly segregated than those that were not. Gorard made his findings by using free school meals as an indicator of poverty. General secretary of teachers union NASUWT, Nigel de Gruchy, welcomed increased school funding but was \"deeply disappointed\" that it was favouring specialist schools, accusing it of being discriminatory. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of NUT, claimed that specialist schools were creating a two-tier education system and that they did nothing to fix the problems of increasing teacher shortages and low morale. He blamed the better results specialists produced on their extra funding and partial selection. John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, warned that unless the extra funding allocated to specialist schools were given to all secondary schools a two-tier education system may very well be created."]}, {"page": "General Council of the Trades Union Congress", "response": ["| Doug McAvoy", "|rowspan=7| Doug McAvoy"]}, {"page": "2019 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Doug McAvoy, 80, trade union leader, General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers (1989\u20132004).
