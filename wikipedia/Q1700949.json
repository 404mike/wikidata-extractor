In the period 1747\u201359, a branch of the Qasemi from Sharjah established itself on the Persian littoral, but it was expelled in 1767. By 1780, the Qasemi branch was re-established on the Persian coast and began to feud with other coastal tribes over pasturage in the islands off Langeh. The Iranian argument for the ownership of the disputed islands is that the Qasami controlled the islands while they were located on the Persian coast, not when they later emigrated to the UAE coast. In April 1873, the islands were reported as a dependency of the Persian Fars province to the British Resident, which the Resident acknowledged. In the period 1786\u20131835 the official British opinion, surveys, and maps identified the Tonbs as part of Langeh, subject to the government of the province of Fars. Chief among them were the works of Lt. John McCluer (1786), political counselor John Macdonald Kinneir (1813), and Lt. George Barns Brucks (1829)."]}, {"page": "John Macdonald", "response": ["*John Macdonald Kinneir (1782-1830), Scottish army officer of the East India Company, envoy to Persia"]}, {"page": "List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Iran", "response": ["*29 July 1826: Colonel John Macdonald Kinneir, Envoy Extraordinary from Government of India"]}, {"page": "John McNeill (diplomat)", "response": ["From 1824 to 1835, he was attached to the East India Company's legation in Persia, at first in medical charge, and latterly as political assistant to the Minister, John Macdonald Kinneir, in which post he displayed great ability.

Mohammad Hossein's term as governor led to the most extensive renovating and building in Qajar times. He renovated Masjid-e Jami, and Madrasa-e Abdallah. He built three madrasas, including Sadr school, built a new palace, renovating many bazaars, restoring and expanding the canal system, and enclosing slums. He removed the famous clock on the Naqsh-e Jahan, rebuilt parts of the Safavid Haft Dast palace and renovated the Bagh-e Anguristan, the Hasht Behesht, and the Talar-e Tavila. He also built a new avenue through the Khaju quarter, Chahar Bagh-e Chinarsu (aka Bagh e Now and Bagh-e Sadri). He also constructed the royal garden, Imarat-e Sadr (aka Imarat-i Naw). Mohammad Hossein was not universally praised, Rustam al-Hukama considered him an \"uneducated parvenu\" and claimed that Mohammad Hossein and his brothers had stolen the possessions and royal insignia of Jafar Khan Zand when Zand fled to Shiraz in 1785.Walcher 2001"]}, {"page": "Sir John Macdonald Kinneir", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Macdonald Kinneir"]}, {"page": "Khalili Collection of Islamic Art", "response": ["The jewellery in the collection numbers almost 600 personal adornments, plus more than 600 rings and 200 luxury items from the royal workshops of the Mughal Empire.

The adornments include almost every kind\u2014from bracelets and amulets to buttons and brooches\u2014from the 7th century onward. They are decorated with gems, enamel, or niello. The collection's Fatimid objects have the \"rope and grain\" filigree style characteristic of Egypt or Syria. The Mughal objects include a ruby engraved with the names of emperors Shah Jahan and Jahangir.  A box from 17th-century Mughal India consists of 103 engraved emeralds in a gold frame, topped by a faceted diamond. Most of the enamelled gold objects made for the Mughal court are now in the Iranian crown jewels or in the Hermitage Museum in Russia; an exception is an octagonal box in the Khalili collection that dates from around 1700. A hookah bowl from 18th-century Mewar in India is made of gold with colourful enamel decoration. A gold badge, collar and star, constituting the Order of the Lion and the Sun, is decorated with enamels and precious stones.
