At the time, Richard was playing drums for the thrash metal band Gross Misconduct.Buckley ed. 2003, p. 337 After placing an ad in a local publication, the pair drafted Mike Heaton to  play drums. Following a handful of live shows, one of which earned an unfavourable piece in Melody Maker, the band took a break from performing to focus on writing material. They rehearsed for a while, prior to Richard McNamara finding a recording of \"Retread\" in Danny's set of demos. Bassist Steve Firth joined the others in 1996. Around this time, the band sent demos to potential managers and eventually settled with Tony Perrin.", "The band with Dave Creffield and Youth produced The Good Will Out. Jonny Dollar, who mixed \"Now You're Nobody\", was asked to produce the album, but declined for personal reasons. Steve Osborne did additional production on \"One Big Family\"; Dollar's lack of involvement allowed Osborne to work with Embrace; he had wanted to work again with a rock-centric band. The band attempted unsuccessfully to draft Steve Albini as producer, and had turned down Butch Vig previously. All the previously released tracks on the final version of the album were re-recorded during the sessions. Danny McNamara explained: \"Everyone says we write songs like we're on our third or fourth album, but the early tracks still had the sound of a fledgling band so I wanted more definitive versions.\"", "Musically, the sound of The Good Will Out has been described as Britpop and post-Britpop. It was compared to the works of Oasis and the Verve, which McNamara felt worked as \"good promotion\" for the release, but clarified that \"90% of 'The Good Will Out' was already written when these bands weren't even successful\". Wil Malone served as the conductor for a string section of the album, and Mickey Dale added keyboards to the recordings. While the album's booklet credits Dale with helping to arrange the strings, Richard McNamara said Craig Armstrong (who worked with Massive Attack at the time) had helped in that regard. The album's title is based on the proverb the truth will out, referring to being positive. It opens with the 40-second \"Intro\", which consists of a forty-piece orchestra setting up their instruments, ending with drum hits that segue into \"All You Good Good People\" featuring the orchestra. Danny McNamara thought the orchestra warming up \"sound[ed] incredible\", and ran into the studio's control room to have it recorded as the intro piece. He asked the orchestra to repeat what they had been doing; they could not remember and just improvised. On the second occasion the band worked with an orchestra, they had the tape rolling; the conductor can be heard filling out Musicians' Union forms. Dale described the piece as capturing the \"feel\" and \"all the excitement and ALL the nerves in the room\". He said \"All You Good Good People\" was the first time he had worked with the band; they required a string arrangement and had asked him for one. The track began originally as \"Mikes Fast\", and went through multiple versions before ending up in its final form. Varying tape noises can be heard, the result of the tape with McNamara's vocals being fast-forwarded and rewound.", "* People from the street:  \"Higher Sights\" is a power ballad in the vein of INXS, and was inspired by \"You Do\" (1995) by McAlmont & Butler. Danny McNamara said he wrote the song after someone told the band they \"weren't [B]ritpop enough\". Dale said the string players  had struggled with the song as the scores were written in the wrong key; the players had to transpose the score while recording it. \"Retread\", a ballad, details the end of a relationship. The guitar riff was played on every guitar the band had before they settled on the final tone. \"I Want the World\" features the use of wah-wah pedals and feedback, and was compared to the work of Oasis. In its original form, the song sounded closer to the Jesus and Mary Chain; Richard McNamara attempted emulating Tim Burgess of the Charlatans.", "\"You've Got to Say Yes\" was about Heaton's best friend Dean who had an \"incredibly tough life\", and was influenced by the work of Curtis Mayfield. Initially, the song was called \"Shallow Time\", had a saxophone, and a section in 6/8 time. For \"Fireworks\", Danny McNamara sang a soul-esque rendition, before they added their instruments. The intro to \"The Last Gas\" is a snippet from a radio show about orangutans; it includes shouting by the Bricklayers. The album's final three tracks are piano-led pieces: \"That's All Changed Forever\", \"Now You're Nobody\" and \"The Good Will Out\". \"That's All Changed Forever\" was influenced by McNamara falling in love, and the effects love has on a person's life. The chorus was inspired after the band saw Superstar, who had a song with a similar sound. The lyrics include a reference to a conversation McNamara and Dale had at Heaton's house in 1995. With \"Now You're Nobody\", Dale said the band took a \"very Pet Sounds approach\", like quieting the drum and bass parts, and adding a lot of reverb. Richard McNamara said they dismantled a music box to sample its notes for the song. \"The Good Will Out\" was the result of combining two separate songs, and is reminiscent of \"Hey Jude\" (1968) by the Beatles. It had a verse from a different song initially, which Jazz Summers said needed re-working. They re-wrote the verse and eventually had the song's final form. Discussing the closing \"la-la-la\" section, McNamara said it was the \"most emotional moment during the recording [...] Think about it, everyone understands La-la-la\".", "The staff at Dotmusic said the album \"challenges The Verve and Oasis out to compare the size of their anthems and the sweetness of their ballads\". They added that while the album, \"sounds massively important, it lacks the soul of [frontman Richard] Ashcroft & co\". Rolling Stone reviewer Matt Diehel said the band \"drag out all the Brit-pop devices\" on the album from the \"obvious Beatles references\u00a0[...] to Stone Roses-ish hubris\". He added the band's \"main problem is lack of personality\". In a review for The Times, Mike Pattenden wrote that when the band \"put the bluster to one side they hit a genuinely soulful note\", but \"when they try and rock their impact is diminished\". PopMatters editor Sarah Zupko said the tracks \"don't quite possess the instant hooks\" that Oasis member Noel Gallagher \"is a master\" of. Despite this, she called it \"a pretty good album of middle-of-the-road Britpop\". Q writer Andrew Collins said tracks like \"The Last Gas\" and \"All You Good Good People\" were the band's \"stock-in-trade\" which was \"rousing in short doses but punishing over an hour, chiefly due to Danny McNamara's limited voice\". He noted strings were \"employed relentlessly but the result is like underlining a shopping list for effect\".", "All songs written by Danny McNamara and Richard McNamara.", "* Danny McNamara \u2013 lead vocals"]}, {"page": "Drawn from Memory", "response": ["Drawn from Memory is the second album by English rock band Embrace, released on 27 March 2000 by Mobetta, Hut, and Virgin Records. Following the release of their debut studio album The Good Will Out (1998), touring keyboardist Mickey Dale became an official member. Frontman Danny McNamara began suffering from writer's block, leaving guitarist Richard McNamara to handle the writing. Sessions were done at Batsford Park Manor in Gloucestershire, Olympic Studios in London, and Soundworks Studios in Leeds. Tristin Norwell and the band producer the entire album, bar \"You're Not Alone\", which was produced by Hugo Nicolson. Songs on the album centred around the arrangements and the interplay between instruments, instead of being melody-driven.", "Embrace released their debut studio album The Good Will Out in June 1998. It peaked at number one in the UK; all of its singles charted within the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with \"Come Back to What You Know\" reaching the highest at number six. \"All You Good Good People\" attracted minor attention from college radio in the United States. Prior to embarking on a tour of Europe at the end of 1998, touring keyboardist Mickey Dale was made an official member. Vocalist Danny McNamara suffered from writer's block, and as such, his brother, and the band's guitarist, Richard McNamara handling the majority of the songwriting.", "Drawn from Memory has been compared to Urban Hymns (1997) by the Verve. During the recording, the band were influenced by Nick Cave, Simon & Garfunkel, and jazz albums from the label Blue Note Records. The songs were based on the musical arrangements and how instruments interact with one another, instead of being driven by the melody. The orchestration throughout the album is more subdued than on The Good Will Out. The album opens with the country-soul ballad \"The Love It Takes\". Danny McNamara wrote it on an acoustic guitar during the making of The Good Will Out, before showing it to the rest of the band, who added music in the style of Frank Zappa. It slowly builds and ends with a guitar solo crescendo. Dale said the band wanted to open the album with a \"bold departure\" to separate it from The Good Will Out. \"You\u2019re Not Alone\" is a ballad that is reminiscent of The Good Will Out track \"Fireworks\", and the work of the Boo Radleys. Richard McNamara showed the band the song during the mixing of The Good Will Out, and nearly put it on that album, until their label pushed to release the album as-is. McNamara said they added the song to Drawn from Memory last as the label told the band they \"needed an Embracey track\".", "\"Save Me\" shares a similar chord progression as \"Everyday Is a Winding Road\" (1996) by Sheryl Crow, and touches on gospel music. It was originally known as \"Plasterscenic\" and lacked a chorus, until they played the song and Danny McNamara sung the first words that came to him, \"save me\". The piano-driven \"Drawn from Memory\" opens with several bars of classical chamber music, while it overall recalled the sound of Cave's The Boatman's Call (1997). McNamara wrote the track in Thailand, when its intro section was known as \"Barbara\"; he later played it for the rest of the band during a soundcheck in Denmark. The band spent several days working on the track to without any success, by which point, Dale worked on the arrangement at his house. The day after, the band were pleased with his changes; he played the part on a Yamaha grand piano with directions from McNamara, which later had to be edited out of the final recording. The Led Zeppelin-lite \"Bunker Song\" is an instrumental that was done in homage to \"Nine Acre Court\" (1995) by the Charlatans.", "\"New Adam New Eve\" is a psychedelic track with Eastern-esque guitarwork that the band saw as their attempt to emulate \"Song 2\" (1997) by Blur. \"Hooligan\" is sung by Richard McNamara, features a kazoo solo, and is done in the vein of Beck and the Beta Band. Bassist Steve Firth said the band did not want a guitar solo as they felt \"they sound really cheesy\", so they opted for a kazoo. McNamara said the song dealt with peer pressure, as well as the \"happiness comes from focusing on what you have rather than what you don\u2019t have\". \"Yeah You\" channels the sound of Nirvana, specifically their track \"Pennyroyal Tea\" (1993). It was initially known as \"Pavement\". Danny McNamara recorded his vocals for \"Liars Tears\", another ballad, at the end of the garden at Batsford. \"I Wouldn't Wanna Happen to You\" is a psychedelic pop song with horns during the bridge section. Richard McNamara said it had a \"Midnight Cowboy vibe... all major sevenths for that summery vibe\". Danny McNamara compared the album's closing track, \"I Had a Time\", to The Good Will Out cut \"Retread\". His vocals were lifted from the demo version of the song; it features a clarinet part from drummer Mike Heaton.", "* Coldplay:  \"Save Me\" was released as a single on 22 May 2000. Two versions were released on CD: the first with \"Get on Board\" and \"Still So Young\", while the second included a radio session version and remixes of \"Save Me\". The music video for \"Save Me\" was posted on Dotmusic on 9 May 2000; it sees McNamara walking through a wall of glass, before falling out of a building. As he is dropping to the ground, other people in the building are unaware of him. Following this, they embarked on tours of Japan and Germany. A re-recorded version of \"I Wouldn't Wanna Happen to You\" was released as a single on 7 August 2000. Danny McNamara said they want to \"capture a more wide-eyed summery feel\", which they were unable to do the first time. Two versions were released on CD: the first with \"The First Cut\" and \"I Know What's Going On\", while the second featured \"Top of the Heap\", and a cover of \"3 Is a Magic Number\" (1973) by Bob Dorough.

By April 2000, the band were in the process of writing material for the next album, which they were expecting to record later in the year. While re-recording the fourth single from Drawn from Memory, \"I Wouldn't Wanna Happen to You\", in July 2000, frontman Danny McNamara said they had been working on some new songs.", "Musically, the sound of If You've Never Been has been described as soft rock. Danny McNamara wrote the majority of the lyrics as guitarist Richard McNamara took a break to spend time with his newly born child. If You've Never Been features a heavier use of strings and horns compared to Drawn from Memory; the strings were performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, who were conducted by Will Jackson. The album opens with the sombre \"Over\", which discusses the end of a relationship, the initial feelings that result from it, and the eventual acceptance. Danny McNamara said \"Many Will Learn\" gad a \"lost at sea feel\" to it, which he compared to \"Now You're Nobody\", a track from their debut studio album The Good Will Out (1998). \"It's Gonna Take Time\" is an upbeat song that recalled the band's earlier works. The mid-tempo \"Hey, What You Trying to Say\" features a melodica; Danny McNamara said they tried using an harmonica, though it gave the song \"unwelcome \u2018Roseanne\u2019 feel\". \"If You've Never Been in Love with Anything\" evokes the work of the Kinks.", "All songs written by Danny McNamara and Richard McNamara.", "* Danny McNamara \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar"]}, {"page": "Out of Nothing", "response": ["The band brought in Youth to produce, having had good experiences with his production on singles All You Good Good People and Come Back to What You Know from their first album, The Good Will Out. Most of the band were excited about the effect that bringing new leadership into the studio was having on their music, but Danny McNamara, the band's lead singer, had a tough time adjusting to Youth's production style: \"January, February and March this year were the hardest time of my life. I was getting four hours sleep a night. Every morning I'd get up and have to take a pill just to stay calm that day. The amount of arguments and throwing shit...It was really intense.\" Youth changed McNamara's song structures, his lyrics, and pushed him to sing with more emotion. Said McNamara: \"There were times I hated him. I'd ring our manager and have meetings with the label, where I'd say, 'Look, can you tell him who's boss? 'Cause he's not listening to me.'\" Thankfully, the label kept its position that Youth was in charge, because gradually, things started to click between the band and its producer. McNamara eventually changed his tune, saying, \"I think I've grown as a person...the idea of relinquishing control and just having a bit of belief and faith in someone else is new to me in my thirty-three years. And it's paid off. I've left my ego at the door.\" Several songs began to take shape and sound that had previously eluded the band.", "Out of the 500 possibilities, the band eventually narrowed the list of potential album cuts down to fifteen songs, and then finally decided on the best ten. These included \"Ashes,\" which started life in 2001 as a piano-driven ballad and eventually took the form of a four-minute long anthem of a pop song, \"Someday,\" whose verse was written in 1997 and waited seven years for the rest of the song to show up, and \"Everytime I See Your Face,\" a song that would never see the light of public release. This was due to the addition of \"Gravity,\" a Coldplay-penned composition that Chris Martin (good friend of Danny McNamara) gifted to Embrace after Martin decided that the song sounded a bit more like Embrace than it did Coldplay. \"Everytime I See Your Face\" was dropped from the album, and \"Gravity\" not only found itself on Out of Nothing but also in the role of comeback single, being Independiente's preferred choice over \"Ashes,\" which had been the album's intended first single before the introduction of \"Gravity.\" Danny McNamara referred to this decision as the \"sexy angle.\""]}, {"page": "Hipperholme Grammar School", "response": ["* Danny McNamara, singer"]}, {"page": "All You Good Good People", "response": ["The video for the US single featured Danny McNamara portraying a death row inmate during the last day before execution.
