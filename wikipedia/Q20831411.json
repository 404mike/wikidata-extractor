A contemporary review of Biology of Root-infecting Fungi by the mycologist John Webster praises its \"holistic approach\", and writes that it introduces \"useful generalizations and new concepts\" that elucidate \"previously puzzling data\", and that its \"crystallization of ideas ... put the subject on a more sound theoretical basis\", predicting that they will provide a basis for future experiments. Cooke, writing in 1971, calls the earlier book highly influential, with \"new and exciting ideas\" that stimulated research by many other scientists in the field, and praises the follow up for maintaining the focus on fungal activity and interactions in the natural environment, rather than in the laboratory.
