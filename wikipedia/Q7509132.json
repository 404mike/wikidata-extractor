Then, for his last three victories, he turned balloon buster. On 4 September, he teamed with Sidney Highwood to destroy a German observation balloon. The next day, Thompson destroyed another. On the 15th, he burned another for his final win, despite being tailed by four Fokker D.VIIs; then he was jumped by several more Fokker D.VIIs and wounded seriously in the face and shoulder. He managed to struggle back to base despite his wounds."]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Sidney Highwood"]}]}}
