O'Doherty received a good education and studied medicine, but before he was qualified, joined the Young Ireland party and in June 1848, together with Thomas Antisell and Richard D'Alton Williams, established The Irish Tribune. Only five editions were issued, the first being on 10 June 1848. On 10 July 1848, when the fifth edition was issued, O'Doherty was arrested and charged with treason-felony.

With a group of five friends in the republican movement, including Richard D'Alton Williams and Kevin O'Doherty, Antisell set up a short-lived revolutionary newspaper, The Irish Tribune, in June 1848 to take the place of the suppressed United Irishman, founded by John Mitchel. The paper was closed down on the grounds of sedition in July 1848 after just five issues. Following the closure of the paper, Antisell emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York on 22 November 1848. Some sources claim this departure was to evade arrest or charges relating to sedition. Although he was no longer politically active following his departure from Ireland, he was a close friend of the John Mitchel and his family. Antisell married his first wife, Eliza Ann Nowlan, in 1841. Eliza died shortly after their arrival in America."]}, {"page": "Harriet Osborne O'Hagan", "response": ["The first appearance of O'Hagan exhibiting, under Osborne, was at age nineteen with a lithograph of Mrs Hone after Mr Burton with the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1849.

Encouraged by Sharp to study abroad, O'Hagan lived in London for a time, exhibiting under the name O'Hagan with the Royal Academy of Arts in 1854. Having moved to Paris in 1866, she studied with Thomas Couture, L\u00e9on Cogniet, and Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury. O'Hagan taught classes, with some suggestion that she opened her own academy for women. Between 1866 and 1876, she showed largely portraits at salon exhibitions.

A seditious article of Lalor's from The Irish Felon was quoted on 22 July by the Prime Minister, John Russell, who additionally referred to The Nation. Lalor was quoted by the Marquess of Lansdowne and Baron Kerry, Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, two days later in the House of Lords, after which the Habeas Corpus Suspension (Ireland) Bill was passed.
