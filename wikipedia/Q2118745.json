George S. Patton was assassinated in Germany in 1945 by a motley crew of United States Army officers in an attempt to hide their theft of $250 million in Nazi gold. History says that General Patton died in Germany in 1945 following an automobile accident, but Frederick Nolan, who wrote The Algonquin Project, this film's source material, has connected various unsolved mysteries to make a wobbly case for his conspiracy theory. As historical speculation goes, it's less interesting than wondering where we might be today if Ford's Theater had been playing Uncle Tom's Cabin that fateful night in 1865, instead of Our American Cousin. Would Lincoln have attended, or might he have said, \"Mary, I just can't sit through it again\"? You may elect not to sit through international claptrap like this film, which doesn't measure up even to The Cassandra Crossing ... The Brass Target, which has been rated PG (\"Parental Guidance Suggested\"), contains a lot of violence, all of it simulated but random in the way of simple-minded movie-making.\""]}, {"page": "Andrew Malcolm (author)", "response": ["Methods of calculating royalties changed during the 1980s, due to the rise of retail chain booksellers, demanding increasing discounts from publishers.
