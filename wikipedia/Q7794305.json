They had four children, Robert, Jane, Isabella, and Elizabeth; the daughters worked on their father's memoir after his death. At that period in his life he was described by the Newcastle artist Thomas Sword Good as \"a man of athletic make, nearly 6 feet high and proportionally stout. He possessed great personal courage and in his younger years was not slow to repay an insult with personal chastisement. On one occasion, being assaulted by two pitmen on returning from a visit to Cherryburn, he resolutely turned upon the aggressors, and as he said, 'paid them both well'.\"Quoted in Notes by Mr. A.G. Stephens on Thomas Bewick illustrating a loan collection of his Drawings and Woodcuts (Fine Art Society's Galleries, London, 1880)", "Other portraits include one by William Nicholson dating from 1814 in which Bewick sits with a pencil in his hand and a dog beside his chair;In the Laing Art Gallery the one at his birthplace; and the full-length seated portrait of 1827 by Thomas Sword Good (see above). Another painting by Sword in the National Portrait Gallery is now no longer thought to be of Bewick.Wikimedia An unsigned painting supposedly of him in the Yale Center for British Art is equally dubious."]}, {"page": "Thomas Good (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Thomas Sword Good (1789\u20131872), British painter"]}]}}
