Also he had to wear specially made trousers of 80 inches (200 cm) waist. He became all but a recluse, spending his days simply eating and watching videos, and venturing outside exclusively for hospital appointments. Taylor achieved notoriety in Germany for his eccentric appearance, notably his wig, which he fashioned himself from electrical tape. If anyone asked him about his \"hair\", he would answer \"It's Jack's creation!\".\nHis diet was said to consist of up to 15 tandooris each day. He achieved some notoriety as a result of his size, including appearing on the TV show The Fattest Men in Britain alongside Barry Austin.  In one TV show, Being The Fattest Man, he was weighed at 31 stones (or 196kg). However, Taylor believed he was much heavier, and this annoyed him greatly; he insisted the scales were faulty.\nHe died on 4 February 2006 at the age of 60 from a heart attack. Taylor was cremated at Rawdon crematorium in Leeds, which has special facilities to deal with larger coffins.In 2009 a fictionalized account of his later years in life was made into TV movie called The Fattest Man in Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of heaviest people", "response": ["* Barry Austin and Jack Taylor, two obese British men documented in the comedy-drama The Fattest Man in Britain."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2006", "response": ["*Jack Taylor, 60, one of the heaviest men in Britain, heart attack."]}, {"page": "2006 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 4 February \u2013 Jack Taylor, one of Britain's heaviest men (born 1946)"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Taylor", "response": ["* Jack Taylor (actor) (born 1936), American horror movie actor", "* Jack Taylor (heavyweight man) (c. 1946 \u2013 2006), heaviest man in Britain at his death", "* Jack Taylor (musician) (1965\u20131997)", "* Jack Taylor (19th century baseball player) (1873\u20131900)", "* Jack Taylor (20th century baseball player) (1874\u20131938), Chicago Cubs pitcher", "* Jack Taylor (basketball) (born 1990), American basketball player who set the NCAA single-game scoring record", "* Jack Taylor (footballer, born 1914) (1914\u20131978), English footballer and football manager", "* Jack Taylor (referee) (1930\u20132012), English football referee for the 1974 World Cup Final", "* Jack Taylor (Scottish footballer) (1872 \u2013 after 1910), Everton F.C. player", "* Jack Taylor (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "The Fattest Man in Britain", "response": ["The Fattest Man in Britain is a comedy-drama written by Caroline Aherne and Jeff Pope, and directed by David Blair, which aired on ITV, STV & UTV on 20 December 2009.
