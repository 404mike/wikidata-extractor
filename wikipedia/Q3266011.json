John Mayow Talmage a clergyman of Cornish stock. During his childhood, Talmage got into an accident with a gun, permanently injuring his right hand, as a result Talmage painted with his left hand and was exempt from active service in the First World War. In 1892, Talmage studied under Hubert von Herkomer at the Herkomer School of art in Bushey. During his time at Herkomer, Talmage painted alongside Lucy Kemp-Welch, both of whom had a great interest in painting landscapes and horses. From there he moved to St Ives, Cornwall, where he joined the St Ives School. During his time in Cornwall Talmage founded an artists club which was greatly influenced by the Cornish coastline, Talmage's time in Cornwall was significant in establishing his characteristic mellow palette and enchanting use of light. Talmage is best known for tutoring Emily Carr during her studies at St Ives when he lived and worked in his studio which was then called 'The Cabin' located on Westcotts Quay, St Ives. His criticism was a significant early influence on her work, encouraging her earliest forays into the forest paintings that would eventually become her trademark. Carr's vivid palette grew from his critical reminder that \"there is sunlight in the shadows.\"Tippett, Maria: \"Emily Carr: A Biography.\" Stoddart: 1979, 1999.
