Richard Sinclair had been an early member, but left in September 1965 to study at college. Hastings had replaced Robert Wyatt as the group's singer and Coughlan as drummer in the band when Wyatt, who performed both roles, formed Soft Machine. David Sinclair joined the group in late 1966, but after future Soft Machine member Hugh Hopper left the group in June the following year, they began to run out of momentum and broke up in October 1967.", "Coughlan, Hastings and the two Sinclairs subsequently formed Caravan in 1968. \"We all had the same goal\" recalled Richard Sinclair, \"to make our music, write it ourselves, and make a living from it.\" The band rented a house in Whitstable, Kent for six months, where they began to write and rehearse new material. They also borrowed Soft Machine's PA for rehearsals while that band was on tour with Jimi Hendrix in the US, as Caravan did not have enough funds for their own equipment. They were forced to leave in June and ended up living in tents and rehearsing in a local church hall. By October, they had attracted the interest of music publisher Ian Ralfini, who signed them to the American record label, Verve Records, and became the first British act they signed. Verve subsequently released the band's debut LP, Caravan (1968), later the same year, but a few months later moved out of the UK record business and dropped the band.", "Caravan had started to build a live following by mid-1970, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands to an audience of 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In autumn 1970, Caravan began working on one of their most critically acclaimed albums, In the Land of Grey and Pink (1971). The balance of songwriting changed from the previous two albums, with Richard Sinclair taking a more prominent role. His song, \"Golf Girl\" was originally written about his then girlfriend (and future wife), but the lyrics were rewritten in the final version. The group decided to follow up \"For Richard\" with a suite of short sections of songs written by David Sinclair, that the rest of the band worked on and linked together to form a side-long track, \"Nine Feet Underground\". Although, the track was recorded in five separate stages and spliced together, the band performed the suite live as it was finally presented on the album, and it remained a popular track in their live set. The album was released in April 1971, and though it did not chart, it has remained in print ever since, and has been remastered for CD several times, notably a digital remaster in 2011 by Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson. \"Nine Feet Underground\" in particular was a regular fixture on late-night FM radio during the early 1970s.", "The remaining members continued on together and Richard Sinclair invited keyboardist Steve Miller to join the band. However, it was immediately apparent that the style of the band would be different. Sinclair and Miller wanted to perform more jazz-rock, while Hastings was frustrated that the previous style was being neglected, and that it was \"virtually impossible\" to get Miller to perform in David Sinclair's style. The band started recording a new album, Waterloo Lily (1972) in late 1971, which was the first use of orchestral instrumentation, arranged by Hastings and his brother, Jimmy, who had guested on previous albums. The album was released in May 1972, but by this time, musical differences had come to a head, and after a gig with Genesis in July, the band split. Richard Sinclair later said, \"It didn't quite work with Steve in the band because the music started to go a bit too loose for the way that Pye and Richard Coughlan played.\"", "The resulting album For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night (1973) was a major critical achievement and showed that the group could survive the loss of co-vocalist Richard Sinclair. Jimmy Hastings reprised his role as orchestrator along with Martyn Ford and John Bell, while the Soft Machine's Mike Ratledge contributed an instrumental piece, \"Backwards\" as part of a medley. The group followed this with a live album, Caravan and the New Symphonia (1974), including orchestral arrangements by Ford and conducting by Simon Jeffes.", "Caravan were largely dormant in the 1980s until a 1990 reunion, planned as a one-off for television, reinvigorated their career.

This version of the group released The Battle of Hastings in 1995.", "Caravan are considered a key example of the Canterbury scene genre. Their records generally indicate a jazz influence, and the group's lyrics have been described as whimsical and very \"English\", particularly during Richard Sinclair's tenure in the band. Following Sinclair's departure, the musical direction has been predominantly led by Pye Hastings, who preferred a softer pop rock approach. Though the group share a common history with Soft Machine, they have been considered more melodic and closer to folk music and frequently displaying a sense of humour.
