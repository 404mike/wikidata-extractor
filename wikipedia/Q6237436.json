A group of six Labour councillors under the leadership of Eddie Roderick declared they would not approve an illegal budget, but the majority of the Labour group thought the letter was a tactic to scare them into backing down.Hatton, \"Inside Left\", p. 80-1. The council leadership put forward an illegal budget on 29 March; after an eight-hour meeting, Roderick put forward an amendment to delay setting a budget until 11 April to let officers prepare a legal one. A suggestion that council leader John Hamilton and chair of Finance Tony Byrne form an emergency committee to control finances in the interim was accepted but the delaying amendment fell: it had the support of the Conservatives and six councillors in Roderick's group but the Liberal councillors opposed it and supporters of the council leadership abstained.Hatton, \"Inside Left\", p. 82.

Stonefrost suggested increasing rates by 15%, and cutting the housing programme.Hatton, \"Inside Left\", p. 107-8. The council's budget problems for the 1985\u201386 financial year were only solved when the council removed \u00a323m from its capital budget to fund revenue spending, and borrowed \u00a330m from Swiss banks to replenish the capital fund. The council also transferred \u00a33m in loans which it had given to other Labour councils and found \u00a33m of budget savings.
