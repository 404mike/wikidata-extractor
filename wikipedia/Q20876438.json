Later he joined NERC as Director of Marine and Atmospheric Science (1986-1994), where he created the National Oceanography Centre at Southampton. He held professorships at Southampton University (1972\u201377), Kiel University (1977-86) and Imperial College London (1994- ), carrying out research into the seasonal boundary layer of the ocean and plankton ecosystem models, and modelling global container freight.Woods has served on a number of international project committees, including GARP (Global Atmospheric Research Programme), WCRP (World Climate Research Programme0, IGBP (International GeoSphere-Biosphere Programme), EuroGOOS (European Global Ocean Observing System). He was co-chairman of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment. He was a lead author of the first report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an organisation which was later awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with Al Gore.He is now (2015) Emeritus Professor of Oceanography & Complex Systems in the Faculty of Engineering, Department of Earth Science & Engineering, Imperial College London.  He is Adjunct Fellow of Linacre College, University of Oxford (1994-  ), and Emeritus Researcher of the CNR (Italian National Research Council). \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Woods", "response": ["John Woods may refer to:", "* John Woods (logician) (born 1937), Canadian professor of logic", "* John Woods (oceanographer) (born 1939), British professor of oceanography", "* Johnny Silvo (John Woods, 1936\u20132011), British folk and blues singer", "* John Levene (born John Woods in 1941), British actor", "* John Woods, a Scottish showman who exhibited the Tay Whale around Britain in the 1880s", "* John Woods (Pennsylvania politician) (1761\u20131816), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania", "* John Woods (Ohio politician) (1794\u20131855), U.S. Representative from Ohio", "* John Woods (Australian politician) (1822\u20131892), Minister of Railways in colonial Victoria", "* John Woods (Canadian politician) (1876\u20131957), in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick", "* John Woods (civil servant) (1895\u20131962), British civil servant", "* John Woods (baseball) (1898\u20131946), MLB player for the Boston Red Sox", "* John Woods (athlete) (born 1955), Irish long-distance runner", "* John Woods (footballer) (active 1954\u20131967), Scottish-Canadian footballer", "* John Woods (rugby league) (born 1956), English footballer 1970s\u20131990s, coached in the 1980s"]}, {"page": "Gold Medal (RGS)", "response": ["| John Woods||"]}, {"page": "William Gaskell Medal", "response": ["*1992 John Woods"]}, {"page": "Underwater Association", "response": ["The Underwater Association grew out of the popularity of scuba sports diving clubs in British universities in the 1950s and 60s. Diving became popular after the introduction of the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba set, the Aqua-Lung, in the 1940s, and clubs were established in many British universities from 1957 onwards. Members of these clubs, and of research institutions, used scuba diving to pursue various scientific projects under water. Some projects involved the study of diver physiology and psychology, while others made use of diving to study marine biology, underwater archaeology, geology, physics and other topics. Members of the Cambridge University Underwater Exploration Group and Imperial College London were particularly active. They ran expeditions to Malta in the early 1960s, and enjoyed close cooperation with the Royal Navy which provided compressed air and a recompression chamber. In 1965 five different scientific diving teams were active in Malta. The different teams were organised as follows: The Cambridge University Malta Expedition 1965, an undergraduate group studying diurnal behaviour in marine invertebrates (winners of the first ever Duke of Edinburgh/British Sub-Aqua Club award for diving science); and a group from Oxford University, studying mainly algae and geology. There was also a Vision Group from various institutions, studying the visibility of underwater objects and the perception of size and distance, a group led by John Woods from the Physics Department Imperial College London studying thermocline instability;  and a Helium Group, led by Nic Flemming from Cambridge University, studying the psychological and ergonomic efficiency of divers breathing heliox and air at a depth of 60\u00a0m. In total, 32 divers were involved in these projects. The groups shared many facilities and a conference was organised to present the results in late 1965, with the papers published in 1966. After this publication, the group established an association as a company limited by guarantee and which was registered as a charitable organization."]}]}}
