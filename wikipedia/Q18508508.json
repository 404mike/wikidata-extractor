He was an officer in The Sherwood Foresters during the First World War and was killed in action in only his second time in the trenches, after he fell down a shaft which had been used to explode a mine under the German lines. His book on Chartism, which he had begun before the war, was completed and published posthumously in 1918. It was one of the first scholarly works on the subject and one of the first to have been written by someone who was not a first-hand witness to events.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 1916", "response": ["* Died: George Turner, Australian state leader, 18th Premier of Victoria and first Treasurer of Australia (b. 1851); Mark Hovell, British educator and military officer, author of The Chartist movement (b. 1888)"]}, {"page": "Julius West", "response": ["*Mark Hovell"]}, {"page": "Hovell", "response": ["* Mark Hovell (1888\u20131916), English historian."]}, {"page": "Hovell, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Hovell"]}]}}
