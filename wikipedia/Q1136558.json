He had proposed an early prototype for a Bailey bridge before the war in 1936, but the idea was not acted upon. Bailey drew an original proposal for the bridge on the back of an envelope in 1940. On 14 February 1941, the Ministry of Supply requested that Bailey have a full-scale prototype completed by 1 May. Work on the bridge was completed with particular support from Ralph Freeman. The design was tested at the Experimental Bridging Establishment (EBE), in Christchurch, Dorset, with several parts from Braithwaite & Co., beginning in December 1940 and ending in 1941. The first prototype was tested in 1941. For early tests, the bridge was laid across a field, about  above the ground, and several Mark V tanks were filled with pig iron and stacked upon each other."]}, {"page": "Christchurch, Dorset", "response": ["The Fisher Aviation Company began to provide flights from fields at the eastern end of Somerford Road in 1930, and by 1933 the company had flown over 19,000 passengers.Stannard (1999) pp. 226\u2013228.

Throughout the War Macdonald received a number of short-term contracts and commissions for individual pictures from the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC), and the Recording Britain project that kept her employed as an artist throughout the conflict. Macdonalds commissions included both nursing scenes, which WAAC often allocated to women artists, and heavy industrial production and repair work. The first picture Macdonald submitted to WAAC, showing people in a shelter at Queen Alexandra Military Hospital at Millbank during an air raid was deemed unacceptable due to the evident fear and apprehension portrayed. A second hospital painting was accepted in January 1941 and a new depiction of the Millbank air raid was accepted in November 1941. When the QAM Hospital was evacuated to Oxford, Macdonald followed and was permitted to paint at the nearby aircraft dump at Cowley. This resulted in three paintings, one of which was declined by WAAC. During the war, other paintings by Macdonald were accepted by the Committee but were then prohibited from going on public display by wartime censorship, if for example they showed structures built after 1939. In September 1941, she returned to London to paint a cityscape showing St Paul's Cathedral. A painting by Macdonald of the cathedral surrounded by bombed streets was shown in America during the war but was lost when the ship returning it to Britain was torpedoed and sunk. Later commissions included the London Docks, aircraft repair shops and Bailey bridges plus a portrait of their inventor Donald Bailey. In all, nineteen works by Macdonald were acquired by WAAC, including Building the Mulberry Harbour, London Docks (1944) which was requested by the Tate for its permanent collection at the end of the war.
