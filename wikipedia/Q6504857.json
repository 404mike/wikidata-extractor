Ten year man Russell Bromage went to Bristol City in exchange for \u00a325,000 and Lawrie Pearson, also Jon Bowden went to Wrexham for \u00a312,500. Coming in was striker Darren Beckford for \u00a315,000.

The campaign was boosted by a 'famous' 2\u20131 victory over top-flight Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup. The cup run and sale of Jones had helped to pull in a record \u00a3410,239 profit. A boost for 1988\u201389 came with the sale of an unused training ground at Cobridge for \u00a3164,800. Halfway through the season, veteran Phil Sproson was advised to retire following a serious knee injury; to replace him, defender Dean Glover was signed from Middlesbrough for a club-record \u00a3200,000. The club finished third, failing to gain automatic promotion because of their worse goal difference.
