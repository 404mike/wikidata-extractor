He studied law at the Catholic University, Dublin, after which he went to London. He was a founder-member there of the Irish Literary Society and also joined the London Gaelic League. He became political secretary to Patrick McMahon, a role which introduced him to senior British and Irish politicians.\nHe was loyal to, but not uncritical of, Charles Stuart Parnell, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party at Westminster. Parnell wished to make him an MP, but he declined, as he preferred to remain focused on writing. He wrote a much-discussed biography of Parnell in 1898. O'Brien was a political insider and a committed Home Ruler and the biography throws light on the activities of Home Rule MPs and their links to the Fenian Movement.\nHe supported involvement in the First World War, where three of his sons fought.He died in London and was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wolfe Tone", "response": ["His journals, which were written for his family and intimate friends were published in Washington DC in 1821 by his son, William Theobald Wolfe Tone.

She was the only child of Terence Hannan and Mary Daly. Her father died when she was an infant, leading her mother to move to England with her. They lived with her uncle, the Rev. Richard Hannan, at a parish at Lamley Moor, near Durham. There she was schooled in a French school and Loreto nuns. From a young age she was involved with the Gaelic League in London, possibly influenced by her cousin Richard Barry O'Brien. It was through her involvement in his movement she met her husband, Philip Armfield Sargent, a timber merchant. They married in London on 16 September 1908 when she was 17. Philip was an English Quaker, but had strong sympathies with Irish nationalism and was involved in the events of Easter 1916. After that he was possibly held in Lewes naval prison until June 1916 when he was transferred to Frongoch camp, north Wales."]}, {"page": "William Kirby Sullivan", "response": ["Sullivan was the editor of Atlantis, a Catholic University science journal with a literary section (begun in 1858 by Newman), and was a vice-president of the Ossianic Society, an Irish literary society named after the legendary Irish poet Ois\u00edn. His interest in philology, according to his close friend Denny Lane, began earnestly in Germany. He did articles for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, on the Celts for example, and other publications. As well as his scientific articles concerning plant chemistry and agriculture, in 1858-9, he completed a 100-page article in Atlantis, On the influence which the Physical Geography, the Animal and Vegetable Productions, etc. of different regions exert upon the Languages, Mythology, and early Literature of Mankind, with reference to its employment as a test of Ethnological Hypotheses. In 1863, he published as a book his extended translations of a selection of the works of the German philologist and expert on Irish and British language origins, Hermann Ebel, from Beitr\u00e4ge zur vergleichenden Sprachforschung [Contributions to comparative language research], which he'd contributed to Atlantis. In 1866, having been a council member for four years, he became a vice-president of the Royal Irish Academy and secretary from 1867-74. He translated and edited the posthumously-published lecture series of his former colleague, O'Curry, On the manners and customs of the ancient Irish. This necessitated a long introduction and appendices for the series, encompassing the whole initial volume, and became his most celebrated work, a key reference book in itself: Henry Maine, for example, quotes extensively and Jeremiah Curtin visited him for a few days in 1887. Along with the future British ambassador to the U.S.A, James Bryce, and Richard Barry O'Brien, he was an editor of Two Centuries of Irish History (1888); he wrote the section covering the years from the Treaty of Limerick (1691 -1782) entitled The Ireland of the Penal Days with his friend, the poet and political journalist George Sigerson. Considering his translations, there has been some dispute about how he gained his expertise in Irish and other languages, save for German (Irish was widely spoken around his birthplace)."]}]}}
