He is Head of Governance and Contracts at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and editor of the science fiction peer-reviewed literary magazine, Foundation. His criticism has appeared in Strange Horizons, The New York Review Of Science Fiction, and Vector. He also writes a column for Locus. Several volumes in the Gollancz SF Masterworks series contain introductions written by Sleight. In 2005 and 2006 he was a judge of the Arthur C. Clarke Award. He is Managing Editor of the third edition of The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (SFE3).\nThe 2012 Hugo Award for Best Related Work was given to the SFE3. Sleight accepted the award from emcee John Scalzi on behalf of the editors, saying, \"We set out to build this really for the whole of the SF community... for any and all who are hungry for information about science fiction.\"Sleight frequently writes about Doctor Who. He co-edited The Unsilent Library, a book of essays about the Russell T Davies era of the show, and provided commentary on the 2011 BBC DVD release of \"The Ark\".

In contrast, Fraser McAlpine and Nick Page felt that the Yeti being controlled gave them greater menace. McAlpine says this gives the Yeti menace because, being controlled, they can't hold any feelings or grudges of their own and act only as the fierce physical agents for whoever can control them. Page reflected that 'the Great Intelligence... always turned off their power when it was not required', creating suspense when characters interacted with a seemingly dormant Yeti."]}, {"page": "Uplift (science fiction)", "response": ["* David Langford. \"Uplift\".

Graham Sleight noted that Timelash is \"widely regarded as one of the worst series ever broadcast as part of Doctor Who\", claiming the story has \"a weak script, cheap-looking design, unimaginative direction, laughable special effects and some appalling performances\". However, Sleight also praises Robert Ashby's performance as the Borad, claiming Ashby's performance \"elevates his menace to an entirely different level to the rest of the story\". Tat Wood described it as \"a grindingly dull story only memorable for being made as a school panto with belated New Romantic 80s fashion errors\". Wood singled out the story's script, production and costumes for particular criticism. Wood also pointed out the H.G. Wells depicted in Timelash is different from the real-life Wells (the Wells depicted in Timelash is not blond, lacks a Cockney/Kentish accent, and is interested in spiritualism)."]}, {"page": "A Little Something for Us Tempunauts", "response": ["Strange Horizons noted the story's \"slipstreamish effect of contemporary strangeness\".The Vintage Book of Amnesia: An Anthology of Writing on the Subject of Memory Loss, edited by Jonathan Lethem, reviewed by Graham Sleight, at Strange Horizons; published September 4, 2006; retrieved October 19, 2018 The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction mentioned its \"grim\" nature.Time Loop, at The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction; first published November 27, 2007; retrieved October 19, 2018"]}, {"page": "Foundation (journal)", "response": ["* Graham Sleight, #101-15 (2007\u201313)"]}, {"page": "The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five", "response": ["The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five is told largely from the point of view of the matriarchal utopian Zone Three, which places the novel in the category of feminist utopias or feminist science fiction. The Canopus in Argos series in general falls under the banner of soft science fiction, or \"space fiction\" as Lessing called it, due to its focus on characterisation and social and cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of science and technology. Comparative literature professor Robert Alter suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre that literary critic Northrop Frye called the \"anatomy\", which is \"a combination of fantasy and morality\". Author Gore Vidal placed Lessing's science fiction between John Milton and L. Ron Hubbard\". American screenwriter and film director Frank Pierson called Lessing's science fiction \"mythic tale[s]\" that are closer to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Herbert's Dune than works by Clarke and Asimov. British writer Graham Sleight said The Marriages comes closest to Ursula Le Guin's works in the way that both Lessing and Le Guin scrutinise societies. Sleight compared The Marriages to Le Guin's science fiction novel The Dispossessed (1974), saying that each revolves around conflicts between differing worldviews, namely the Zones in The Marriages, and Anarres and Urras in The Dispossessed."]}, {"page": "Rogue Moon", "response": ["Graham Sleight, another science fiction scholar, writes that Rogue Moon takes the themes of Who? \u2014 \"identity, ethics, memory, scientific obsession \u2014 and intensifies its gaze on them.
