Again, only two boats appeared at the starting line: Quicksilver and Gyrinus. Quicksilver became threatened by water coming in over the sides, abandoning the race. Gyrinus, a small boat with an extra crewman to bail water, was able to finish to make its crew the first Olympic champions in motorsports. Gyrinus was the earliest round-bilge Semi-Planing Mono-Hull ('SPMH') designed by Sir John Isaac Thornycroft FRS, the great Victorian engineer, previously the designer and builder of the world's first torpedo boats and torpedo boat 'Destroyers'. Development of the technical features of Gyrinus (combining speed with good seaworthiness, as demonstrated in the 1908 Olympics) was described in 'Engineering', the Proceedings of the Society of Civil Engineers, on March 12, 1909. His son, Isaac Thomas Thornycroft, the Gyrinus helmsman, became a yacht designer and helmsman of J-Class racing yachts. Thomas's son, Commander Peter Thornycroft (1914\u20131987), carried on the family tradition, developing the SPMH as the standard Nelson Class of Pilot Boat for Trinity House (1964 to 1987) and, later, up to much larger sizes of offshore patrol vessels. The US Navy's 350\u00a0ft./114-metre/3,200-ton/45-knot USS Freedom is the largest SPMH launched to date (2006). It combines a higher speed-for-length than would be possible with a conventional destroyer hull, good seakeeping at speed, and a high payload\u2014characteristics that enabled the little Gyrinus to win her famous Olympic victories.", "* Isaac Thomas Thornycroft"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the Olympics", "response": ["* John Field-Richards, Bernard Boverton Redwood and Isaac Thomas Thornycroft (Water Motorsports)"]}, {"page": "Thornycroft (disambiguation)", "response": ["*** Isaac Thomas Thornycroft (1881\u20131955), son of John Isaac, motorboat and yacht racer, 1908 Olympic gold medalist in motor boating"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| rowspan=2|, Bernard Boverton Redwood,Isaac Thomas Thornycroft ", "|rowspan=2| Class B \u2014 Under 60 feet ||bgcolor=gold align=center| 1st || Gyrinus || Isaac Thomas Thornycroft  Bernard Redwood  John Field-RichardsField Richards is not listed in the IOC medallist database. ||align=center| Finished"]}, {"page": "Water motorsports at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Class B", "response": ["|align=center|  || Gyrinus ||John Field-RichardsBernard Boverton RedwoodIsaac Thomas Thornycroft ||  || Unknown"]}, {"page": "Water motorsports at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Class C", "response": ["|align=center|  || Gyrinus || John Field-Richards  Bernard Boverton Redwood  Isaac Thomas Thornycroft ||  || Unknown"]}, {"page": "List of keelboat classes designed before 1970", "response": ["| 1943 || Swallow ||  || Isaac Thomas Thornycroft || || || || "]}, {"page": "Issac Thomas Thornycroft", "response": ["#REDIRECT Isaac Thomas Thornycroft"]}]}}
