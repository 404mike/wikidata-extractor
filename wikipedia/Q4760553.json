Since 2016 he presents the Andy Cousin show on Deal Radio.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "All About Eve (band)", "response": ["All About Eve was an English rock band. The initial creative core consisted of Coventry-born Julianne Regan (vocals), Huddersfield-born Tim Bricheno (guitar) and Andy Cousin (bass guitar), with other members changing over the years. Their highest-charting UK single was \"Martha's Harbour\" (1988). The band was active from 1984 to 1993, then 1999 to 2004, achieving four UK Top-50 albums. The band had been recognised for their \"unique, folk-rock-influenced take\" on the gothic rock style, and Regan has been described as \"certainly one of the more talented singers\" of the scene in the late 1980s."]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Andy Cousin (All About Eve, The Lucy Nation, The Mission)"]}, {"page": "Mark Price (musician)", "response": ["Price was recruited to All About Eve in 1987, during the recording of their first album.  He therefore appeared on the album cover even though he did not play on all of the songs, which instead featured the Mission's Mick Brown. He did, however, become the mainstay drummer of the band, featuring on all the band's albums up to Ultraviolet. He briefly carried on with Marty Willson-Piper and Andy Cousin to create the one-off album Seeing Stars."]}, {"page": "Julianne Regan", "response": ["Regan moved to London aged 19 and found work as a journalist for music magazine ZigZag, while studying at the London College of Fashion. In her capacity as a journalist, she interviewed Gene Loves Jezebel and subsequently joined that band on bass guitar. Soon after, apparently unhappy with the tension between the group's twin frontmen, she left to make music with good friend and former Xmal Deutschland drummer Manuela Zwingmann, while working in a book shop on Charing Cross Road after Zig Zag went bust. During this period she met, though friends of friends, both Andy Cousin and Tim Bricheno then both playing for goth band Aemotii Crii. The band that resulted, at first consisting of Regan, Zwingman, Bricheno and James Richard Jackson, was originally called The Swarm, but was changed to All About Eve after Regan and Zwingman watched the classic film at Regan's parents' house in Southport, Lancashire. ", "The first line-up recorded the single \"D For Desire\" in 1985, but, following disagreements around artistic direction between Zwingmann and Regan, the former left the band. Soon after this, Andy Cousin replaced Jackson on bass, thus creating the first well-known All About Eve line-up of Bricheno, Cousin and Regan, plus a drum machine. The group recorded demos and played several gigs.", "Revolving around a central core of Regan, Tim McTighe, former Levitation member Christian Hayes (aka 'Bic') and, for studio recordings, the original All About Eve drummer Mark Price, Mice released their first single, \"Mat's Prozac\", in November 1995, which charted in the UK. This was followed by a second UK charting EP single \"The Milkman\" released in April 1996 with the Lynsey De Paul song Martian Man. Countrywide touring followed as did an album Because I Can recorded for indie label Permanent Records. Many collaborators took part in this band, including both Marty Willson-Piper and Andy Cousin which led to people questioning why this band was not launched as another incarnation of All About Eve. Regan said that this was deliberate in that she had wanted the new band to be just that. Musically, it did indeed sound somewhat harsher than All About Eve and Regan would later say of it, \"It showed that I could be pre-raphaelitic but I still had to get on the bus and go to Tesco's.\" With Because I Can making the Indie Top Ten, the future began to look fairly positive for Mice, but Permanent Records went out of business in 1997, leaving the album and the three singles \"Mat's Prozac\", \"The Milkman\" and \"Dear Sir\" hanging in the shops without promotion or replacement. ", "Although material for a fifth full All About Eve album had been worked on by Regan and fellow band-member Andy Cousin, it seemed unlikely that this album will be completed. In April 2009, Regan stated on her Facebook page: All About Eve are dormant and may never happen again. I don't ever like to say never though, but it seems we've all moved on and are exploring other avenues."]}, {"page": "Skeletal Family", "response": ["In 2018 Hurst left to form Killing Eve with Andy Cousin."]}, {"page": "All About Eve (album)", "response": ["All songs written and composed by Tim Bricheno, Andy Cousin and Julianne Regan except where noted.", "*Andy Cousin - bass"]}, {"page": "Scarlet and Other Stories", "response": ["All songs written and composed by Tim Bricheno, Andy Cousin, Mark Price and Julianne Regan except where noted.", "*Andy Cousin \u2013 bass, keyboards (5)"]}, {"page": "Touched by Jesus", "response": ["*Andy Cousin - bass"]}, {"page": "Ultraviolet (All About Eve album)", "response": ["*Andy Cousin - bass, 12-string guitar (tracks 7 and 11)"]}, {"page": "Fairy Light Nights", "response": ["The \"Fairy Light Night\"  concerts featured a simple line-up of Julianne Regan on lead vocals, Marty Willson-Piper on a variety of acoustic guitars and backing vocals, and Andy Cousin on electric bass or acoustic 12-string guitar, with occasional guest appearances by other musicians."]}, {"page": "Because I Can (Mice album)", "response": ["Mice were formed in 1995 by (then) ex-All About Eve lead singer Julianne Regan and ex-Powder bassist Tim McTighe.
