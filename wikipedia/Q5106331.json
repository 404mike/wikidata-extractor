He turned professional on 13 July 1990 and went on to make 152 appearances for the Gulls, scoring 4 goals. On 22 December 1995 he was, surprisingly, sold to local rivals Plymouth Argyle for \u00a340,000, but failed to settle at Home Park, moving to Exeter City on 31 July 1997 for \u00a320,000.\nThis move made him one of only a handful of players to have played for all three of the Football League sides in Devon. He made an impressive start to his career at Exeter, but in September 1997 picked up a serious knee ligament injury which ruled him out for the remainder of the season. He returned to the side and a regular place in the team, so much so that he was one of only a handful of players not released or transfer listed by manager Noel Blake in May 2000.\nHe was appointed as club captain and in January 2001 was sent off in the game against Torquay United after only six minutes of the game.Having struggled with knee and hamstring problems, Curran was loaned to Tiverton Town in December 2002. He played eight times for Tiverton, before being recalled by Exeter as they unsuccessfully struggled to avoid relegation from the Football League. He suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon just before the end of the 2002\u201303 season and was released by Exeter.\nHe relocated back to the Midlands to recuperate and enrolled on a Physical Education course at the University of Wolverhampton.In February 2004 he was reported to be looking to join a non-league club, and agreed terms with Weymouth, managed by Steve Claridge, the following month. However, he failed to appear for Weymouth and returned to the Midlands.He joined Willenhall Town in August 2004. In January 2005 he joined Newport County on trial, which resulted in a permanent move. He was released by Newport in September 2005 and returned to Willenhall Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1996 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["|CB ||4 ||Chris Curran"]}, {"page": "Chris Curran", "response": ["Chris Curran may refer to:", "* Chris Curran (actor) (died 1996), Irish actor, singer and musician", "* Chris Curran (Australian footballer) (1974\u20132018), former Australian rules footballer", "* Chris Curran (footballer, born January 1971) (born 1971), English footballer for Crewe Alexandra, Scarborough and Carlisle United", "* Chris Curran (footballer, born September 1971) (born 1971), English footballer for Torquay United, Plymouth Argyle and Exeter City"]}, {"page": "Chris Curran (footballer born September 1971)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Curran (footballer, born September 1971)"]}, {"page": "1991 Football League Fourth Division play-off Final", "response": ["The match was refereed by George Courtney in front of a crowd of 21,615.
