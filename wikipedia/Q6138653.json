When the First World War intervened, his plans were scaled down and he retired in 1924. Thomson's ideas for extending City Square were developed again in 1924, when the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts-trained Burnet was commissioned to produce designs for the east and west wings to City Square. Thomson died in 1927, and James MacLellan Brown, as Depute City Architect, remodelled Burnet's designs in 1931 and produced the scheme that was built. Later Brown collaborated with Professor Ralph Allen Sampson, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, in designing Mills Observatory, a much more modern building than the one originally planned before the war.\nBrown died of a pulmonary embolism at Maryfield Hospital in Dundee on Christmas Day 1967, two weeks after suffering a heart attack.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* James MacLellan Brown (c. 1886\u20131967), city architect of Dundee, designer of the Mills Observatory"]}, {"page": "James Brown (disambiguation)", "response": ["* James MacLellan Brown (\u00a0\u2013 1967), Scottish architect"]}, {"page": "Balgay", "response": ["Balgay (Gaelic: Baile (na) Gaoithe) is a suburb in the west end of Dundee, Scotland.
