Lydon initiated legal proceedings against McLaren and the Sex Pistols' management company, Glitterbest, which McLaren controlled. Among the claims were non-payment of royalties, improper usage of the title \"Johnny Rotten\", unfair contractual obligations, and damages for \"all the criminal activities that took place\".

The group's personnel has changed frequently over the years; Lydon has been the sole constant member.", "Upon returning to England, Lydon approached Jah Wobble (n\u00e9 John Wardle) about forming a band together. The pair had been friends since the early 1970s when they attended the same school in Hackney (both belonged to a circle of friends Lydon informally dubbed \"The Gang of Johns\" \u2013 John Lydon, John Wardle, John Gray, and Simon John Ritchie/Beverley, a.k.a. Sid Vicious). Lydon and Wobble had previously played music together during the final days of the Sex Pistols. Both had similarly broad musical tastes, and were avid fans of reggae and world music. Lydon assumed, much as he had with Sid Vicious, that Wobble would learn to play bass guitar as he went.  Wobble would prove to be a natural talent. Lydon also approached guitarist Keith Levene, with whom he had toured in mid-1976, while Levene was a member of the Clash. Lydon and Levene had both considered themselves outsiders even within their own bands.

The resulting album was notable for its almost complete lack of bass parts. Martin Atkins, who had initially joined at the tail end of the Metal Box sessions, was re-recruited to drum on The Flowers of Romance. Levene had by then largely abandoned guitar in favour of synthesiser, picking up a new technique although owing a debt to Allen Ravenstine of Pere Ubu. Atkins' propulsive marching band-style drumming, the lack of bass and guitar, and Lydon's increasing lyrical abstraction made this LP a difficult listen for rock fans, and contemporary reviews expressed great confusion. The record consists mostly of drums, vocals, musique concr\u00e8te, and tape loops, with only gestures toward bass (played by Levene) and keyboards. The title \"Flowers of Romance\" was the name of a short-lived band featuring Keith Levene, Viv Albertine, and Sid Vicious in 1976. The track \"Francis Massacre\" was partially inspired by Lydon's incarceration in Mountjoy Prison and the track \"Hymie's Him\" began life as an instrumental piece intended for the score of Michael Wadleigh's 1981 werewolf film Wolfen.", "* Keith Levene on PIL"]}, {"page": "Sid Vicious", "response": ["Vicious began his musical career in 1976.
