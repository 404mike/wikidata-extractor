When Waterford drew Cork in the cups the club would usually be easily beaten. When Waterford played Cork in Turners Cross in the EA Sports Cup in 2016 they were beaten 7\u20130.

And despite Waterford being in the First Division they manage to secure the signing of Waterford born Cork centre back Kenny Browne who was on the back of a great season where he starred for the rebels as they won the FAI Cup.
