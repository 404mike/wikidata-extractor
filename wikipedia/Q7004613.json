Bors reviewed the book favorably in the Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology, concluding that \"It undoubtedly is a book that anyone interested in cognitive abilities would wish to explore because of its encyclopedic, in-depth coverage of the topic.\" In the journal Gifted Child Quarterly, Michael C. Pyryt of the University of Calgary described the book as \"...a remarkable achievement that should be of interest to everyone in gifted education\" and \"an important contribution to the field of individual differences.\" Neville A. Stanton stated that \"The work presented...appears to be as exhaustive as it is comprehensive.\" In another favorable review, Timothy Z. Keith predicted that the book \"...will become a sourcebook for researchers and an invaluable resource for others interested in human cognitive abilities.\" Robert B. Burns of the University of California, Riverside praised it as \"truly a remarkable book\" and as \"simply the finest work of research and scholarship I have read\".
