He has research interests in applied probability, decision analysis and optimal decisions, including optimal stopping and stochastic optimization.\nGittins was an Assistant Director of Research at the Department of Engineering, Cambridge University from 1967 to 1974. Then he was a lecturer at Oxford University from 1975 to 2005 and head of the Department of Statistics there for 6 years. In 1992, Oxford University awarded him the degree Doctor of Science (D. Sci.). In 1996 he became a Professor of Statistics  at Oxford University.\nHe has been awarded the Rollo Davidson Prize (1982) for early-career probabilists, and the Guy Medal in Silver (1984).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Multi-armed bandit", "response": ["Herbert Robbins in 1952, realizing the importance of the problem, constructed convergent population selection strategies in \"some aspects of the sequential design of experiments\".
