He was awarded a Military Cross in 1917. While in England on active service, Hudson was called upon to give expert advice in a case involving mining in Rhodesia, which was later called \"one of the most lengthy and costly court cases of its time.\"Following the war, Hudson returned to Bulawayo and continued to work as a barrister, gaining praise as \"the leading advocate in Southern Rhodesia.\" Following the confirmation of responsible government to Southern Rhodesia in 1923, the colony's first Premier, Sir Charles Coghlan, appointed Hudson as Attorney-General of Southern Rhodesia, an appointment considered \"unusual\" at the time as Hudson was not a member of Coghlan's Rhodesia Party.Hudson subsequently joined the Rhodesia Party and successfully stood for the electorate of Bulawayo North in the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly at the 1924 election. Following the election, Hudson was appointed Minister of Justice (as the position of Attorney-General had been renamed) and Minister of Defence.Re-elected in 1928, Hudson was considered one of the most outstanding members of the first Cabinet.\"In 1933, Hudson resigned from the Legislative Assembly to sit on the High Court of Southern Rhodesia and served as resident judge in Bulawayo until 1943, when he was appointed Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia. While serving as Chief Justice, Hudson twice acted as Governor of Southern Rhodesia; the first from 26 October 1944 to 20 February 1945, and the second from 19 July 1946 to 14 January 1947.\nHudson retired as Chief Justice on 15 May 1950, his 65th birthday. Hudson continued to be involved in public affairs, chairing the Rhodesian Board of the Standard Bank of South Africa from 1957 to 1962, chairing the Federal Broadcasting Service (FBS), as well as serving on numerous other boards and Royal Commissions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1963", "response": ["**Robert James Hudson, Governor of Southern Rhodesia (b. 1885)"]}, {"page": "1885", "response": ["* May 15 \u2013 Robert James Hudson, Governor of Southern Rhodesia (d. 1963)"]}, {"page": "Southern Rhodesia", "response": ["|Sir Robert James Hudson"]}, {"page": "Robert Hudson", "response": ["*Robert James Hudson (1885\u20131963), Governor of Southern Rhodesia"]}, {"page": "Governor of Southern Rhodesia", "response": ["| Sir Robert James Hudson", "| Sir Robert James Hudson"]}, {"page": "1920 Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election", "response": ["* Robert James Hudson, Attorney General"]}, {"page": "1924 Southern Rhodesian general election", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Robert James Hudson"]}, {"page": "1928 Southern Rhodesian general election", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|\u2020Robert James Hudson"]}, {"page": "Ministry of Defence (Zimbabwe)", "response": ["! rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Robert James Hudson"]}, {"page": "First Cabinet of Southern Rhodesia", "response": ["| Department of the Attorney-General || Attorney-General || rowspan=2|Major Robert James Hudson (Bulawayo North) || Solicitor-GeneralSecretary to the Law Department & Legal AdviserSenior JudgeJudgeMaster of the High CourtCommissioner of PoliceRegistrar of Deeds"]}, {"page": "1950 New Year Honours", "response": ["* The Honourable Sir Robert James Hudson, , Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia, and Acting Governor of the Colony on several occasions."]}, {"page": "1944 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*The Honourable Robert James Hudson, , Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia."]}, {"page": "1938 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Major the Honourable Robert James Hudson "]}, {"page": "Chief Justice of Zimbabwe", "response": ["|Sir Robert James Hudson"]}]}}
