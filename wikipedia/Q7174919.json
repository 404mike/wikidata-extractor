In May 2020, three senior judges allowed the appeal, saying the girl \"must be distanced entirely from Universal Medicine\" and that the mother's involvement with the cult is a \"pervasive source of ongoing harm\" to the young girl. Lord Justice Peter Jackson, sitting with Lord Justice McCombe and Lady Justice King, said: \"Shared care can therefore only continue if the mother makes an immediate and definitive break from the organisation. Otherwise Lara (not the child's real name) should move to live with her father full time and have supervised contact with her mother.\""]}]}}
