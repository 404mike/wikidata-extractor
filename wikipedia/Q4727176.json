Jean-Jacques Petter and Arlette Petter-Rousseaux toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, David Attenborough introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of John Buettner-Janusch, who founded the Duke Lemur Center in 1966, Alison Jolly traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux's sifaka at Berenty Private Reserve. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as Alison Richard, Robert Sussman, Ian Tattersall, and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of Elwyn L. Simons and the conservation efforts of Patricia Wright. In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered."]}, {"page": "Newnham College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Dame Alison Richard"]}, {"page": "Professor Alison Richard", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alison Richard"]}, {"page": "Larry Kramer", "response": ["In 1997, Kramer approached Yale University, to bequeath several million dollars \"to endow a permanent, tenured professorship in gay studies and possibly to build a gay and lesbian student center.\" At that time, gender, ethnic and race-related studies were viewed warily by academia.

The site is north of Sidgwick Avenue and south of West Road, and is home to several of the university's arts and humanities faculties. The site is named after the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, who studied at Cambridge in the 19th century.   The site as it is now has its origins in plans drawn up by Casson and Conder in 1952 for making use of land to the west of the Cambridge city centre which was previously used mainly for sports. Much of the site's current architecture derives from these original plans. However, many faculty buildings, especially to the north of the site, have been designed by separate architects with little reference to the coherence of the site as a whole. In July 2002, the old Faculty of English, a converted Victorian villa, was demolished, and a more practical building designed by Allies and Morrison to reflect the needs of the faculty was completed in 2004. The Alison Richard Building, completed in 2012 and designed by Nicholas Hare Architects, brings together a number of different research groups (Interdisciplinary Geographical Centres), the new department of Politics and International Studies (POLIS) and the Centre for Research in Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH).", "thumb|The Alison Richard Building"]}, {"page": "Richard J.

That day, Wen was scheduled to give the Rede Lecture at the University of Cambridge entitled, \"See China in the Light of Her Development\". As Wen came to the end of his lecture, a man, later identified as a 27-year-old German national Martin Jahnke, stood from the audience, blew a whistle and shouted, \"How can the university prostitute itself with this dictator here? How can you listen to these lies he's telling?\" Jahnke then threw his shoe at Wen, although the shoe landed a few feet away. Fellow members of the audience shouted at Jahnke, \"Shame on you\", as he was escorted out of the auditorium. Jahnke was promptly removed from the lecture by university proctors and then arrested by police on suspicion of breach of the peace and attempted assault. After the shoe was thrown, Premier Wen commented, \"this despicable behaviour cannot stand in the way of friendship between China and the UK.\" University Vice-Chancellor Alison Richard commented, \"I deeply regret that a single member of the audience this afternoon failed to show the respect for our speaker that is customary at Cambridge. This university is a place for considered argument and debate, not for shoe-throwing.\" Premier Wen urged leniency for the German student. \"Education is best for a young student, and I hope he will have the opportunity to continue his education. The return of a prodigal is worth more than gold\", said the message from Wen, posted on the Foreign Ministry website. A district judge later concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove that Jahnke's behavior had caused harassment, alarm or distress to the Chinese leader or anyone else in the lecture theater. \"I didn't want to hit the premier personally. I thought just placing the shoe on the stage would be universally understood. What it was meant to be was a symbolic protest. I didn't intend to hurt people.\" During his trial, Jahnke's lawyers alleged that his prosecution was being pushed forward under pressure from the Chinese government, and that there had been political interference in the trial, though this accusation was dismissed by the trial judge due to lack of evidence.Hoff, Henning: Cambridge Shoe Thrower Is Cleared, Time Magazine "]}]}}
