As he explained, \"All that the user perceives of the system is this remote-access console, and the remainder is a black box to him. ... one may as well fill the black box with people as with machinery. Doing so provides a comparatively cheap simulator, with the remarkable advantages of the human operator's flexibility, memory, and intelligence, and which can be reprogrammed to give a wide range of computer roles merely by changing the rules of operation. It sometimes lacks the real computer's speed and accuracy, but a team of experts working simultaneously can compensate to a sufficient degree to provide an acceptable simulation.\" Cross later referred to this as a kind of Reverse Turing test.Cross, N (2001) \"Can a Machine Design?\", Design Issues, Vol. 17, No.41, pp. 44-50."]}, {"page": "Design science", "response": ["There has been recurrent concern to differentiate design from science.
