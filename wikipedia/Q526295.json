The Lions won all but one non-test matches, losing to the Brumbies 14\u201312 on 18 June. The first test was followed shortly after this, which saw the Lions go 1-up over Australia winning 23\u201321. Australia did have a chance to take the win in the final moments of the game, but a missed penalty by Kurtley Beale saw the Lions take the win. The Wallabies drew the series in the second test winning 16\u201315, though the Lions had a chance to steal the win had it not been because of a missed penalty by Leigh Halfpenny. With tour captain Warburton out of the final test due to injury, Alun Wyn Jones took over the captaincy in the final test in Sydney. The final test was won by the Lions in what was a record win, winning 41\u201316 to earn their first series win since 1997 and their first over Australia since 1989."]}, {"page": "September 16", "response": ["*  1951   \u2013 Andy Irvine, Scottish rugby player and coach"]}, {"page": "Scotland national rugby union team", "response": ["Scotland achieved 100 points for the first time in defeating a young and inexperienced Japan side 100\u20138 on 13 November 2004.
