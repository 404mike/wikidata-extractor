While a South Shields player, he received a six-month ban (then the longest in English football history) for exceptional rough play in a Second Division match versus rivals Middlesbrough in March 1927. He was sent off in a Gateshead reserve team match in April 1931 and was suspended until the end of the 1931\u201332 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leadgate Park F.C.", "response": ["* Cyril Hunter"]}, {"page": "1921\u201322 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Brentford began the season inconsistently and hovered around mid-table, before a run of just four defeats in 17 games firmly established the club in the top six by January 1922. Forwards Harry Morris and Harry Anstiss scored the majority of the team's goals and player-manager Mitchell had dropped himself from the team in favour of Cyril Hunter in December 1921. On 11 February 1922, Freddy Capper became the first Brentford player to be sent off in a Football League match. He received his marching orders from referee Harry Curtis, who would later be appointed as Brentford's manager in 1926. Five defeats in seven matches during February and March, coupled with poor away form throughout the season, ruled out the possibility of automatic promotion, but the team finished strongly and won five of the final eight matches to finish 9th. Brentford won just one away league match during the season, which is the joint-fewest in club history.", "|Cyril Hunter", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Cyril Hunter", "| Cyril Hunter"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Cyril Hunter", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Cyril Hunter"]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Third Division South club Brentford decided not to conduct an overhaul of its squad during the 1923 off-season.
