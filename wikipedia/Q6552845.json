He was a left-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler who played for Kent and Derbyshire.Having played with the Kent Second XI team between 1979 and 1986, a seven-year tenure which ended after two showings in the 1986 County Championship, and numerous showings for the Second XI as a tailender, he moved to Derbyshire in time for the 1986 County Championship.\nAt Derbyshire, he was always to be the tenth man, followed solely by the tenacious defensive backstrokes of the Great Dane, teammate Ole Mortensen, while maintaining a slightly leakier bowling attack. He did not play first-class cricket again after the 1986 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lindsay Wood (curler)", "response": ["Lindsay Wood is a Scottish curler.", "| Kelly Wood || Lorna Vevers || Lindsay Wood || Janie Johnston || Jacqui Reid || Keith Prentice ||  (5th)", "| Kelly Wood || Lorna Vevers || Jacqui Reid || Lindsay Wood || Susan Halliday (WJCC) || Cate Brewster || SJCC 2001  (5th)", "| Kelly Wood || Lorna Vevers || Jacqui Reid || Lindsay Wood || Frances McKerrow || Cate Brewster ||  (5th)", "| Kelly Wood || Lorna Vevers || Sheila Swan || Lindsay Wood || Claire Milne (ECC, WCC) || Chris Hildrey (ECC),Mike Hay (WCC) ||  (5th)SWCC 2005  (6th)", "| Kelly Wood || Lorna Vevers || Kim Brewster || Lindsay Wood || Kerry Barr (WCC) || || SWCC 2006  (8th)", "| Kelly Wood || Jackie Lockhart || Lorna Vevers || Lindsay Wood || Karen Addison (WCC) || Hew Chalmers || SWCC 2007  ", "| Kelly Wood || Jackie Lockhart || Lorna Vevers || Lindsay Wood || Karen Addison (ECC) || Hew Chalmers ||  CCC 2007 ", "| Kelly Wood || Jackie Lockhart || Lorna Vevers || Lindsay Wood || Eve Muirhead || Alan Hannah ||  (6th)", "| Sarah Reid || Kerry Barr || Barbara McPake || Lindsay Wood || || ||", "| Ross Mackay || Kelly Wood || Garry Mackay || Lindsay Wood || SMxCC 2000 ", "| Kelly Wood || Gary Wood || Lindsay Wood || Graeme Prentice || SMxCC 2003 ", "| Kelly Wood || Ross MacDonald || Lindsay Wood || Kenneth Edwards || SMxCC 2004 "]}]}}
