He was orphaned before the age of five. and adopted, along with his brother, by Archdeacon Harrison of Canterbury. This is where he began to play cricket playing with children in the neighbourhood in informal single wicket competitions. He played his first organised game at Great Mongeham in 1861 making 22 not out.\nHe was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge.\nHis career at Eton was slow to win approval. The master in charge of cricket, Fred Bell, did not like his attacking play. Thornton remarked that it was because he hit all the best balls into the trees. He had success in both Eton v Harrow and Oxford v Cambridge matches, then very much part of the London season. He must have had independent means because on graduation he was able to rent a hunting box in Oxford with his cousin, hunting three days a week and playing cricket the other four.He was considered one of the biggest hitters in cricket, with one shot at Hove in 1876 claimed to have exceeded 160 yards.\nHe hit the ball over the pavilion at Lord\u2019s in the 1868 Eton v Harrow match. This, however was over the old pavilion. The only person to have struck a ball over the current pavilion (built 1889-90) is AE Trott. Other claims made by Thornton included a 156 yard hit at Ranelagh, a 152 yard hit at Canterbury and a 136 yard hit at Scarborough, the ball landing in Trafalgar Square (Scarborough).Thornton founded the Orleans Club which was active for ten years from 1878. His own private team \u2014 C. I. Thornton's XI \u2014 played most of their early games at Fenner's, but after his retirement from playing in 1897 their home became Scarborough, where they continued to play first-class cricket until 1929, the year of Thornton's death. He died aged 79 in Marylebone, London.\nThornton had some interesting ideas about cricket. He wanted bowlers\u2019 run ups limited to 10 yards, and the wearing of leg guards (pads) to be forbidden. The only protection he advocated was football style shin pads.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ranjitsinhji", "response": ["That winter, Jackson had taken part in a cricket tour of India, where he was impressed by the standard of cricket. When he observed, at the start of the 1893 cricket season, the dedication with which Ranjitsinhji was practising in the nets to increase his concentration against the highly regarded professional bowlers Tom Richardson and Bill Lockwood, Jackson asked Lockwood for his opinion. Lockwood noted how much Ranjitsinhji had improved through practice and told Jackson he believed Ranjitsinhji was better than several players in the University team. Then, Ranjitsinhji's early form in 1893, scoring heavily for Trinity and performing reasonably well in a trial match, convinced Jackson. He made his first-class debut for Cambridge on 8 May 1893 against a team selected by Charles Thornton; he batted at number nine in the batting order and scored 18. He maintained his place in the side over the next weeks, making substantial scores in several innings against bowlers with a good reputation. He grew in confidence as the season progressed; critics commented on several occasions on the effectiveness of his cut shot and his fielding was regarded as exceptionally good. His highest and most notable score came during a defeat by the Australian touring team when he made 58 runs in 105 minutes, followed by a two-hour 37 not out in difficult batting conditions during the second innings. His batting made a great impression on spectators, who gave him an ovation at the end of the game. The game appears to be the first occasion in first-class cricket where Ranjitsinhji used the leg glance. Ranjitsinhji was awarded his Blue after the match, and following some more successful but brief innings, he played in the University match. He was given a good reception by the crowd but scored only 9 and 0 in the game, which his team won. With the Cambridge season over, Ranjitsinhji's batting average of 29.90 placed him third in the side's averages, with five scores over 40. He took nineteen catches, mainly at slip. Such was his impact that Ranjitsinhji was selected in representative games, playing for the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval and for a team combining past and present players for both Oxford and Cambridge Universities against the Australians, scoring a total of 50 runs in three innings."]}, {"page": "Lionel Palairet", "response": ["In 1895, Palairet was fourth in the national batting averages, having scored 1,313 runs at 46.89. The three batsmen above him, Archie MacLaren, Grace and Ranjitsinhji all appeared for England that year. Palairet scored three centuries during the season; two against Middlesex, on the latter occasion batting undefeated through the whole Somerset innings, and one against Yorkshire, when he struck 165. He passed a thousand runs again the following year, maintaining a batting average in excess of 40. A fourth-innings score of 83 not out that season drew praise from Ranjitsinhji; on a difficult pitch, Palairet farmed the strike and rescued a draw for his side.Ranjitsinhji (1897), pp. 194\u2013196. Just over a month later, he reached his highest total in first-class cricket, scoring 292 runs against Hampshire. It was his first double century, and the highest score by any Somerset batsman in first-class cricket at that time. One newspaper in Australia, reporting on his innings, declared that; \"should he retain his form he will certainly be worthy of a place\u00a0... in the final Test match at the Oval.\" Either side of that match against Hampshire, he appeared for the Gentlemen against the Players at The Oval and Lord's, but made little impact on either game. He returned to form against Sussex on their visit to Taunton, sharing a 249-run partnership with his brother, and scoring 154 runs himself. The match was played shortly before the final Test match against Australia, but despite the comments in the Australian press, Palairet was not selected for the match. He did appear twice against the tourists that summer, for Somerset he scored six across two innings, and chosen to play for Charles Thornton's XI during the Scarborough Festival, he scored 71 runs in an innings victory."]}, {"page": "Smokers v Non-Smokers", "response": ["Beginning their second innings after lunch, there was a little improvement for the Smokers, though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top-scored for his side, remaining 43 not out at the end of the innings, while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite these scores, the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non-Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non-Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required, reaching the total shortly after six o'clock. The match was played at Lord's in good weather on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground."]}, {"page": "Charles Thornton", "response": ["Charles Thornton may refer to:", "* Charles Thornton (cricketer) (1850\u20131929), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Jack Crossland", "response": ["In 1885 Lancashire once again were unable to face either Middlesex or Nottinghamshire as the two sides maintained their boycott. Crossland was chosen to appear for Charles Thornton's England XI against Cambridge University, in which he took seven wickets for 117. In late May, he took four for 52 and three for 51 against Kent at Old Trafford. When Lord Harris was clean bowled by Crossland, the Lancashire crowd \"seemed fairly beside themselves with delight. Hats and coats were thrown up\" according to the Manchester Guardian, which also observed that some felt Crossland had achieved his revenge against Lord Harris.. After the match, Lord Harris, unhappy with the return of Crossland and Nash to the Lancashire side, requested that the Kent committee cancel the home fixture against Lancashire. The committee agreed with his argument, and Kent became the third first-class county to refuse to play against Lancashire. Crossland only played six matches for Lancashire in 1885 before, acting upon objections raised by Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club, the Marylebone Cricket Club ruled that he had breached his residency qualification by returning to live in Sutton-in-Ashfield during the winter period. Due to this, he was not allowed to play for Lancashire, effectively ending his first-class career. Nash retired from county cricket at the end of 1885 due to criticisms about his own action, and fixtures between Lancashire and Middlesex, Nottinghamshire and Kent resumed in 1886. Crossland played two further first-class matches, in 1886 and 1887, both for Charles Thornton's XI against Cambridge University."]}, {"page": "T. N. Pearce's XI", "response": ["The T. N.

He played in two further first-class matches that year, all in May and all against Cambridge; in the third match, once again representing an \"England XI\", he claimed his solitary wicket in first-class cricket, dismissing Thomas Latham bowled. Lyttelton reached his highest score in first-class matches the following year for the same side, scoring 27 runs while batting at number ten (in a twelve-per-side contest). He did not appear in first-class cricket in 1875, but returned to Cambridge in 1876, the year after his graduation, to appear for the Gentlemen of England. Playing for the Cambridge side in that match were two of his brothers, Edward and Alfred. The Gentlemen won the match by three wickets, but Edward and Alfred outperformed their brother, who did not bowl, and scored one run in his only batting innings. The Times said of him, \"'Bob' Lyttelton, though not famous as a cricketer like some of his brothers owing to a certain slowness of foot, was a close student and an able critic of the game\"."]}, {"page": "Charles Inglis Thornton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Thornton (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Charles Thornton (1869\u20131895) : C.
