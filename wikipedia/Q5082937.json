He was orphaned before the age of five. and adopted, along with his brother, by Archdeacon Harrison of Canterbury. This is where he began to play cricket playing with children in the neighbourhood in informal single wicket competitions. He played his first organised game at Great Mongeham in 1861 making 22 not out.\nHe was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge.\nHis career at Eton was slow to win approval. The master in charge of cricket, Fred Bell, did not like his attacking play. Thornton remarked that it was because he hit all the best balls into the trees. He had success in both Eton v Harrow and Oxford v Cambridge matches, then very much part of the London season. He must have had independent means because on graduation he was able to rent a hunting box in Oxford with his cousin, hunting three days a week and playing cricket the other four.He was considered one of the biggest hitters in cricket, with one shot at Hove in 1876 claimed to have exceeded 160 yards.\nHe hit the ball over the pavilion at Lord\u2019s in the 1868 Eton v Harrow match. This, however was over the old pavilion. The only person to have struck a ball over the current pavilion (built 1889-90) is AE Trott. Other claims made by Thornton included a 156 yard hit at Ranelagh, a 152 yard hit at Canterbury and a 136 yard hit at Scarborough, the ball landing in Trafalgar Square (Scarborough).Thornton founded the Orleans Club which was active for ten years from 1878. His own private team \u2014 C. I. Thornton's XI \u2014 played most of their early games at Fenner's, but after his retirement from playing in 1897 their home became Scarborough, where they continued to play first-class cricket until 1929, the year of Thornton's death. He died aged 79 in Marylebone, London.\nThornton had some interesting ideas about cricket. He wanted bowlers\u2019 run ups limited to 10 yards, and the wearing of leg guards (pads) to be forbidden. The only protection he advocated was football style shin pads.", "link_mentions": {}}}
