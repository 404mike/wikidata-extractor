He joined the Metropolitan Police as a Constable in 1928 and was selected for Hendon Police College in 1934, passing out with the Baton of Honour.\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Bacon was eager to enlist, but was not given permission to do so. Finally in May 1940 he was commissioned into the British Army as a Provost Marshal on the General List. By December 1941, when he was mentioned in despatches for his service in the Western Desert, he held the local rank of Major, although his substantive rank was Lieutenant. He was later promoted Lieutenant-Colonel and in 1942 was appointed Deputy Provost Marshal of the Ninth Army.\nIn November 1943, he was seconded to the Colonial Police Service as Deputy Inspector-General of the Ceylon Police, and was promoted Inspector-General in 1944. His Deputy Inspector-General was John Waldron, another Hendon graduate who was later to succeed him as both Assistant Commissioner \"A\" and Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.\nIn 1947, he returned to Britain as Chief Constable of the Devon County Constabulary, and held the post until his appointment as Assistant Commissioner \"A\" (Operations and Administration) of the Metropolitan Police on 1 November 1961. He was awarded the King's Police and Fire Services Medal in the 1953 New Year Honours. In 1963, he was appointed Assistant Commissioner \"C\" (Crime), in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department. At a press conference on 31 December 1964, he urged the public to \"have a go\" if they saw an armed robbery taking place, which was criticised as irresponsible by many.

The four-man commission was headed by Sir Ranulph Bacon, who had recently retired as deputy commander of Scotland Yard. The commission reported that the United Bahamian Party, previously in government, had been a front for mob-affiliated American casino interests, and that the former Premier, Sir Roland Symonette, and the influential Tourism Minister, Sir Stafford Sands, and some others, all received large payments from the casino and resort businesses they had permitted to operate. The commission also found, however, that Lynden Pindling, during his campaign, had been funded and aided by U.S. casino operator Michael McLaney in the expectation that Pindling would permit McLaney to operate in the islands. Because of the report, Pindling broke his link with McLaney, but was not himself prosecuted.
