He was later loaned out to Fulham, but when he returned to the Magpies the following season, he found it hard to displace Gordon Hughes. Taylor left the club in 1960 to join Chelmsford City, and would later play for Cambridge United, before coming back to Tyneside to work at Newcastle Breweries."]}]}}
