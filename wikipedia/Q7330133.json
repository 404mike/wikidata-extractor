As a result, the then Chief Engraver John Sigismund Tanner produced trials of the intended coin for 1768, 1770 and 1773, and latterly his assistant Richard Yeo created a trial coin for 1777. All were created in small quantities and are now extremely sought after by collectors. The present auction record for a Two Guinea, either currency issue or proof is held by an example of the 1768 Pattern, which sold for over \u00a3120,000 in New York in January 2014."]}, {"page": "History of the British farthing", "response": ["The first halfpennies and farthings with the head of George II's grandson and successor, King George III (1760\u20131820), were issued in 1771, the year Parliament made it a felony to counterfeit copper coin. This had little effect; large quantities were melted down for lightweight imitations, though the farthing was less counterfeited than the halfpenny. This first series of George III farthings, struck in 1771 and 1773\u20131775, had a weight of 4.3\u20135.3\u00a0grams, with diameter 23\u201324 millimetres. The obverse, designed by Richard Yeo or Thomas Pingo depicts a right-facing bust of the king, with the inscription GEORGIVS III REX, while no significant change was made to the reverse. Despite the counterfeiting, the Mint ceased striking coppers in 1775 on the ground that there were sufficient legal farthings and halfpennies in commerce. The farthing would not be struck again by the Royal Mint until 1821.[[]]"]}, {"page": "Yeo", "response": ["* Richard Yeo (scientist) (; ), Chinese American scientist best known for his research on disposable diapers", "* Richard Yeo (\u20131779), British medalist and Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint"]}, {"page": "St Martin's Lane Academy", "response": ["Among the members of the St. Martin's Lane Academy were the engraver and book illustrator Hubert Gravelot; Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac, a French sculptor established in London; the painter Francis Hayman and his pupil, the very young Thomas Gainsborough who was employed by Gravelot; the Swiss-born artist and enameller George Michael Moser; the medallist Richard Yeo and the architect Isaac Ware.
