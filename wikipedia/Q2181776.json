Tammie activates a silent alarm with her foot and the police respond immediately. Hutchinson flees in his Blazer and Silva gets word about the robbery from the sky.

Hutchinson then crashes his car and flees on foot where he encounters Whipple and her boyfriend Julian. Julian runs off and Hutchinson attempts to carjack her.
