However, as the serial neared production, Langford had not decided whether she would leave at the end of Season 24 or during Season 25.

Nathan-Turner and script editor Andrew Cartmel hired Ben Aaronovitch to write the story; Aaronovitch, who had not written for television before, was ecstatic. Aaronovitch was 25 years old at the time, and had been recommended to Cartmel by fellow BBC script editor Caroline Oulton. He initially developed a story idea which later became Battlefield (1989), before Cartmel then commissioned Aaronovitch to write the Dalek story, originally titled Nemesis of the Doctor. According to deals made with Terry Nation, the creator of the Daleks, the script for a Dalek story had to be approved by Nation if he was not writing it. Despite initial concerns, the storyline was approved. One of Cartmel's goals with the story was to have the Doctor be a commanding centre, rather than being \"pushed and pulled\" by the story as he felt had been happening recently. As such, Aaronovitch wanted there to be a spirit of the Doctor just wanting to tackle the Daleks. Two of the first things Aaronovitch thought of when creating the story was the 1963 setting and a Dalek climbing up stairs. He decided to reveal the Daleks in the middle of the first episode instead of as its cliffhanger, and then have the latter be a Dalek levitating up stairs to surprise viewers. The inability of Daleks to climb stairs was an urban myth and a joke, with the Doctor even joking about it in Destiny of the Daleks (1979). Remembrance was intended to put it to rest, though Cartmel noted that the joke was still prevalent. The Dalek civil war seen in Remembrance was intended to be an outcome of the previous Dalek story, Revelation of the Daleks (1985). Aaronovitch felt that destroying Skaro at the end seemed like a logical conclusion, but he noted that it might not be the best decision in the long run.", "Several scenes from Remembrance of the Daleks were cut or edited in production. McCoy's favourite scene, in which the Doctor muses to a worker at a caf\u00e9, was cut down by about half. As originally shot, Ace defused the tension between her and the Doctor when he left her at the boarding house. Also cut was the Doctor curing Ace's leg at the beginning of the third episode, and the issuing of instructions from the Dalek controller through an earpiece. A notable deleted line is the Doctor telling Davros that he is \"far more than just another Time Lord\". This, along with the Doctor's hints that he was present at the creation of the Hand of Omega, was part of the so-called \"Cartmel Masterplan\" by script editor Andrew Cartmel to restore some of the mystery to the Doctor's origins. However, as the programme ceased production in 1989, the intended revelations never came to pass. The original script also had the Doctor blowing up a Dalek with the anti-tank missile in episode two, but McCoy felt this was out of character and suggested Ace should do it instead."]}, {"page": "Doctor Who Magazine", "response": ["| Story Andrew Cartmel; art Arthur Ranson", "| Story Andrew Cartmel; pencils Mike Collins; inks Steve Pini", "| Story Andrew Cartmel; art Richard Piers Rayner", "| Story Andrew Cartmel; pencils Brian Williamson; inks Cam Smith/Steve Pini"]}, {"page": "Russell T Davies", "response": ["Since watching First Doctor's (William Hartnell) regeneration into the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) at the end of the 1966 serial The Tenth Planet, Davies had \"fallen in love\" with the show and, by the mid-1970s, he was regularly writing reviews of broadcast serials in his diary.

In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that.

Storylines would have seen Ace joining the Time Lord academy on Gallifrey, and the introduction of a cat burglar as the new companion. Script editor Andrew Cartmel had already begun work on four loosely connected stories which would have comprised the season: Earth Aid by Ben Aaronovitch (a space opera featuring insect-like aliens), Ice Time by Marc Platt (set in 1960s London, featuring the return of the Ice Warriors and Ace's departure), Crime of the Century by Cartmel (a contemporary story featuring animal testing), and Alixion by Robin Mukherjee (in which the Doctor is lured to an isolated asteroid to play a series of life-or-death games). Ahead of the new companion's introduction, Ice Time would have featured her father, a criminal named Sam Tollinger, who was intended to be a recurring character.
