He served as a Professor of Entomology at Imperial College London and as the second Imperial Entomologist to India. He left India after the death of two of his children from insect-borne diseases. He worked on applied entomology and initiated experiments on the use of chemicals to control insects. A formula he developed was utilized to save Westminster Hall from destruction by wood-boring beetles, while others were used to control lice in the trenches during the First World War. The success of his chemicals led to increased demand and the founding of Rentokil, a company for insecticide production. He was killed in an accident while experimenting on fumigants to control insects.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Harold Maxwell-Lefroy (1877\u20131925), English entomologist who investigated the use of chemicals to control insects"]}, {"page": "Rentokil Initial", "response": ["The Company was founded in 1925 by Harold Maxwell-Lefroy, Professor of entomology at Imperial College, London, who had been investigating ways to kill death watch beetles that had infested Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster.

Although lacking academic qualifications in entomology, he was a meticulous naturalist and very careful on matters of systematics and taxonomic nomenclature. His work as head of entomological research in India was initially on identifying work that had already been done and that which was ongoing. By conducting meetings of researchers he ensured that duplication was avoided. "]}, {"page": "Indian natural history", "response": ["Guha, Ramachandra 2003. Churchill in Bangalore.

Bell (1863\u20131948) and Charles B. Antram (1864\u20131955). However entomology beyond butterfly collection gained importance due to the growing economic importance of agriculture. The position of an Imperial Entomologist was created at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute (later the Indian Agricultural Research Institute). Entomologists who left a mark include William Stephen Atkinson (1820\u20131876), E. Brunetti (1862\u20131927), Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher (1878\u20131950), Sir George Hampson (1860\u20131936), H. E.

With forests being of major economic value, there was an interest in forest entomology. Forest entomology started with E. P. Stebbing (1870\u20131960) and he was followed by many including A. D. Imms (1880\u20131949), who is better known for his entomology textbook that continues with new revisions to remain a standard reference. Other entomologists associated with forest entomology included C. F. C. Beeson. Malaria was a widespread disease and studies on mosquitoes gained special importance. Ronald Ross (1857\u20131932) established the link between mosquitoes and malaria during his researches when positioned at Bangalore, Ootacamund and Secunderabad. Sir S. R. Christophers (1873\u20131978) pioneered in the study of mosquitoes and was involved in the creation of the Malaria Survey of India. Others involved in this field included J. A.

He joined the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa in December 1907 as Second (ie deputy) Imperial Entomologist under Harold Maxwell-Lefroy and from 1912 as Imperial Pathological Entomologist for the Government of India. In 1910 he was in England and Harold Maxwell-Lefroy deputed him to attend the first International Entomological Congress in Brussels, where he presented on the state of economic entomology in India and also on issues in preserving specimens in India. He left India during the First World War and worked with the Royal Army Medical College, while also attending various meetings of learned societies, and returned to India only in 1917. In 1919 he presided over the zoological section of the 6th Indian Science Congress at Bombay, giving a talk on \"tactics against insects.\" One of his most important findings was in noting the attraction of tephritid flies to methyl eugenol, a component that he identified from several others present in citronella oil. He also noted how fleas disliked wet grass and noted a decline in plague during the onset of the rains and suggested that this might be a reason for the plague being rare in Bengal. He published a technique to trap thrips with attractant mixtures of Benzaldehyde, Cinnamaldehyde and Anisaldehyde. Howlett also discovered that he could induce Stomoxys calcitrans to oviposit on cotton impregnated with valerianic acid, which is a component of fermenting vegetable matter. He also noted the life history of mosquito larvae (Stegomyia, now Anopheles) that could survive in dry soil. He also studied the biology of sandflies. Howlett later moved to the Agricultural Research Institute at Pune. Howlett was an athlete and artist but his health was poor during his service in India and he died a premature death due to complications following a surgical procedure at Mussoorie. At the time of his death he was working on a book titled The Control of Harmful Insects.", "Howlett assisted Harold Maxwell-Lefroy in writing and illustrating the book Indian Insect Life.

Books left by students in Beit Hall were collected into a circulation library of around 400 items for personal non-academic recreational reading in the Union Building; this became known as the Haldane Library, named after Richard Haldane, who had been involved in the formation of the college.

From 1907, as first supernumerary entomologist, he conducted studies on the food of birds in India, examining the gut contents of 1325 birds. This was used to classify the birds as harmful, beneficial or neutral in terms of their role in agriculture. He made use of numerical counts of food items eaten, following a system of Robert Newstead , rather than quantify them by biomass. He identified that birds did not play a role as destroyers of weeds through seed eating. The report was published in 1911, coauthored with the Imperial Entomologist, Harold Maxwell-Lefroy. He trained at the Southeastern Agricultural College, Wye in 1910 and in July 1913, he went to study entomology as a Carnegie student at the laboratory of parasitology of the Bureau of Entomology of the United States Department of Agriculture at Melrose Highlands, Massachusetts, before moving to Nyasaland (Malawi) to succeed Edward Ballard as Government Entomologist.
