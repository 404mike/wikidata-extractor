French botanist of Scottish descent, Michel Adanson described the genus Cantarena in 1763. In September 1767, Peter Jonas Bergius described C. scabridum based on Linnaeus' description in the Species Plantarum. In October 1767, Linnaeus distinguished two species, C. glabrum and C. scabrum, abandoning the name C. africanum. Thomas Archibald Sprague in 1940 concluded that C. africanum belongs to the same species and is an older name than C. scabridum. Nicolaas Laurens Burman in 1768 mentioned two species, C. gramineum (now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. gramineum) and C. africanum. Carl Linnaeus the Younger distinguished two additional species, C. villosum and C. filiforme (now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. gramineum) in 1781. Two more species, C. hirtum (a synonym of C. villosum) and C. nervosum (a synonym of C. glabrum), have been described by Carl Thunberg in 1794, who also recognised C. glabrum separately. In 1836, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle described for the first time C. congestum, C. cymosum and C. luteum (now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. gramineum). Danish botanist Christian Friedrich Ecklon mentions but does not describe the name C. hirsutum in 1836 (now C. villosum) in De Candolle's publication. The Irish botanist William Henry Harvey distinguished in 1865 seven species and three varieties, among which the newly introduced names C. latifolium (C. glabrum subsp. glabrum), C. nervosum var. subulifolium, C. scabrum var. filiforme and var. luteum (both now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. gramineum). John Hutchinson added C. fourcadei (now C. africanum subsp. scabridum var. fourcadei) in 1932, and Robert Harold Compton described C. laxum in 1936. Mark\u00f6tter in 1939, recognized 12 species and two varieties, three of which were new and are upheld today: C. enerve, C. theileri and C. rogersii (now C. glabrum var. rodgersii). Frans M. Weitz, in his 1989 Revision of the genus Corymbium (Asteraceae), recognizes nine species, two subspecies and six varieties, including the new taxa C. elsiae and C. laxum subsp. bolusii."]}]}}
