Some have sought to implicate Warburton in their deaths, too, but no direct link seems possible since the trainer himself died of a heart attack in 1897. Even so, it seems highly likely that Warburton did dope his cyclists, and possible that Arthur Linton's death was hastened by damage done to him by drugs administered by Warburton. Yet the symptoms described in the newspapers are consistent with typhoid fever, and we are not entitled to state categorically that drugs played a part.

Linton continued to build upon his early successes, and in the August of that year, in a 100\u00a0km race at the V\u00e9lodrome Buffalo where he faced an American rider, Linton broke several records. His time of 1 hour 58 minutes and 59 seconds over 50 miles beat the world record held by South Africa's Laurens Meintjes, and the same race saw him take the 100\u00a0km record from Frenchman and rival Constant Huret.", "Where 1894 had catapulted him to European fame, 1895 was a poor year for Linton. He injured his knee, saw a poor run of form and split from Warburton's management. That year Tom Linton and Jimmy Michael struck up a public rivalry, which saw the normally media-shy Arthur Linton sucked into a spat between the two men. Michael took offence at Linton's publicity title as 'The Champion of the World', and a challenge was laid down for the two to race, though the event never took place. 1895 was also marred by the death of Linton's mother while he was abroad in France. Linton also found himself out of favour with the cycling authorities in France, when after agreeing to enter a meet in Brussels, he was threatened with disqualification from future French races by the Societie de Paris over a permit issue. Linton agreed to their demands with his eye on the major competitions in Paris. One of his few successes during 1895 was also snatched from him when he achieved a new world record in the 100\u00a0km which had recently been set by Jules Dubois. Although reported as having taken 13 seconds from Dubois time by a journalist from Sporting Life, the lack of an official timer meant that the new time could not be taken into account.", "Although not an issue at the time of his death, in the years following, Linton's image was tarnished by speculation that his death was caused by doping. The seeds of the story began in 1897, when Jimmy Michael was banned from racing in Britain due to a doping controversy. It was well known that Michael's and Linton's manager Choppy Warburton would carry a 'little black bottle' of an unknown substance to revive his flagging cyclists. During a meet in 1896, Warburton had given Michael a swig from his bottle, but the results did not enhance his performance and Michael was forced to retire. Michael claimed that Warburton had poisoned him, and Warburton then sued Michael for slander. This resulted in Warburton being effectively banned from all cycling events and Michael relocating to America. Although no record of the contents of Warburton's bottle was ever discovered it was speculated to be either strychnine or a substance known as 'trimethyl'. Although doping was not illegal under the rules of cycling at the time, and was common in many racing sports, it was felt that Warburton and Michael had crossed the line of acceptable behaviour."]}, {"page": "1895 ICA Track Cycling World Championships", "response": ["| Jimmy Michael "]}, {"page": "James Michael (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Jimmy Michael (1877\u20131904), Welsh world cycling champion"]}, {"page": "Frederick William Burns", "response": ["His announcing in cycling was tantamount to his involvement in the sport.
