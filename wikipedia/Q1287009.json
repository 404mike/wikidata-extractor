Called \"Damascene\" carpets by previous centuries, there is no doubt now that the center of production was Cairo.  In contrast to nearly all other oriental rugs, Mamluk carpets used \u201cS\u201d (clockwise) spun and \u201cZ\u201d (anti-clockwise)-plied wool. Their palette of colours and shades is limited to bright red, pale blue, and light green, blue and yellow are rarely found. The field design is characterized by polygonal medallions and stars and stylized floral patterns, arranged in a linear way along their central axis, or centralized. The borders contain rosettes, often alternating with cartouches. As Edmund de Unger pointed out, the design is similar to other products of Mamluk manufacture, like wood- and metal work, and book bindings, illuminated books and floor mosaics. Mamluk carpets were made for the court, and for export, Venice being the most important market place for Mamluk rugs in Europe."]}, {"page": "Ganjifa", "response": ["An exhibition in the British museum in 2013 noted \"Playing cards are known in Egypt from the twelfth century AD. Ganjafeh was a popular card game in Iran and the Arab world.\" For example, the word 'kanjifah' ( \u0643\u0646\u062c\u0641\u0629 ) is written in the top right corner of the king of swords, on the Mamluk Egyptian deck witnessed by L.A. Mayer in the Topkap\u0131 Palace museum. The Mamluk cards are difficult to date with any certainty, but Mayer estimated these cards to be from the 15th century.  The piece of playing card collected by Edmund de Unger may be from the period of the 12-14th centuries.(Mayer 1971: 9); See also the discussion on the early history of playing cards. The term Kanjifah can be found in the 1839 Calcutta edition of the One Thousand and One Nights, in Arabic, at the end of night 460. The first known reference can be found in a 15th-century Arabic text, written by the Egyptian historian Ibn Taghribirdi (died 1470). In his history of Egypt he mentions how the Sultan Al-Malik Al-Mu'ayyad played kanjafah for money when he was an emir.The text is described in English by Richard Ettinghausen, in his article \"Further Comments on Mamluk Playing Cards\". The quote refers to the work of Ibn Taghribirdi, called \"Nujum al-zahira fi muluk Misr wa'l-Qahira\". Ettinghausen notes that the reference comes in the section describing events from the year 820H or 1417-1418 AD (1984: 1194).
