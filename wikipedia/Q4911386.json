Much of Williamson\u2019s early success came from his association with trainers Lou Robertson and Fred Hoysted, both members of the Racing\u2019s Hall of Fame. His greatest success came in the 1952 Melbourne Cup when he rode Dalray to victory (with a broken left arm, being an injury sustained during a fall some three weeks before). He twice won the Caulfield Cup on Rising Fast in 1955 and Ilumquh 1960. He won the Victorian Jockey\u2019s Premiership in six of the eight years, before he headed abroad in 1960, where he rode until his retirement in 1973."]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bill Williamson"]}, {"page": "1907\u201308 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Bill Williamson"]}]}}
