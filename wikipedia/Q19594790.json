In 1959 he and his friend A. E. Dyson founded the literary journal Critical Quarterly. English teachers in more than half the grammar schools in the country subscribed to it. The journal published five Black Papers between 1969 and 1977. These were controversial, due to their criticism of comprehensive schools and child-centred teaching methods.In February 1993 Cox gave a half-hour Opinions lecture televised on Channel 4 and subsequently published in The Times as \"The right is wrong on English teaching\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tripartite System of education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland", "response": ["However, there was little nationwide organisation among the defenders of the Tripartite System. The most prominent attack on the introduction of comprehensives came in the series of Black Papers (as opposed to White Papers, which are issued by the government) published in the Critical Quarterly by A.E.

B. Cox) and A. E. Dyson. Cox's intellectual formation was in the Department of English Literature at the University of Cambridge, then dominated by the figure of F. R. Leavis. The latter's legacy was a notable feature of Critical Quarterly's early years, when it published work by a new generation of scholars including Raymond Williams, David Lodge, and Frank Kermode. In some respects the journal sought to modify Leavis's project; in particular Cox and Dyson felt that Leavis and his acolytes tended unfairly to ignore contemporary writing, partly because of their unshakeable belief in the \"myth of a culture in decline\".Alan Sinfield, Society and Literature, 1945-1970 (London: Taylor and Francis, 1983), p. 148.
