It was danced by The Royal Ballet, led by its principal dancer Edward Watson as Dante, in his final appearance after 20 years working with and interpreting McGregor. The music was performed live by an orchestra of 75 musicians. Sarah Crompton called the work \"bold, beautiful, emotional and utterly engaging\". The dance is in three sections. \"Inferno\" shows Dante's journey to hell, guided by Virgil, in \"remarkably free and inventive\" choreography, \"rich in feeling\". \"Purgatorio\" shows Dante meeting two incarnations of his young self, and three of the woman he loves, Beatrice. Watson dances with the living Beatrice (Francesca Hayward) \"in lovely, poetic flow\", and then with the heavenly Beatrice (Sarah Lamb) \"all unfolding limbs and ethereal gestures\". \"Paradiso\" has Dante in heaven with the dancers skittering about the stage all in white, in what Crompton calls a mood \"of abstracted joy, deep but dazzling\"."]}, {"page": "Prix Benois de la Danse", "response": ["*Edward Watson (2015) ", "| Edward Watson", "| Edward Watson"]}, {"page": "Dan Gillespie Sells", "response": ["In 2014, he began his collaboration with choreographer Javier de Frutos on a ballet piece entitled '3 With D' which featured The Royal Ballet's principal dancer Edward Watson (dancer) and premiered at The London Coliseum."]}, {"page": "Edward Watson", "response": ["Edward Watson may refer to:", "*Edward Watson (died 1617), MP for Stamford", "*Edward Watson (dancer) (born 1976), dancer with the Royal Ballet", "*Edward Watson, Viscount Sondes (1686\u20131722), English politician, MP for Canterbury", "*Edward Watson (footballer) (1901\u20131986), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Wendy Whelan", "response": ["After her departure from ballet, she shifted her focus to contemporary dance.
