Her work on Dante Alighieri was written under the pen name M.A. Orr.  Although her middle name is increasingly appearing as Ackworth, this is incorrect. She always gave it as Acworth, and it appeared as such in both her obituaries. The one appearing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society was written by her nephew A. David Thackeray, who presumably would have known. The first appearance of this incorrect version could well have occurred in the proposal of Mary to be a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society; the correct spelling appears when she was subsequently elected a Fellow.", "link_mentions": []}}
