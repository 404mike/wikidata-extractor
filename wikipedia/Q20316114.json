His style fused modern, traditional and international influences, although in his ecclesiastical work he often favoured neo-byzantine or romanesque. A review of his work published in 1938 said that he had designed 80 schools and over 40 churches.  At this stage he was mid-career and continued practising for a further 30 years. His buildings are predominantly brick, although often with steel or concrete structural support.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Retford", "response": ["As the Catholic community continued to expand it was decided to build a bigger church and land was purchased on the Babworth Road. The present Catholic church - St Joseph's - opened in 1959 and was designed by Ernest Bower Norris in modern Romanesque design, incorporating Art Deco elements. The church was later reordered in 1968 by renowned Modernist architect Gerard Goalen, at which time a large sculpture by Steven Sykes was introduced. St Joseph's is prominently located on Babworth Road and its campanile serves as a local landmark. In its Conservation Plan, Bassetlaw Council says: \"The bell tower with copper roof is one of the most prominent architectural features within the entire Conservation Area.\" Next to the church is St Joseph's Catholic Primary School."]}, {"page": "Liturgical Movement", "response": ["An example of reordering is St Joseph's church in Retford, which was designed by Ernest Bower Norris in modern Romanesque design, incorporating Art Deco elements. It opened in 1959 and in 1968 was re-ordered by Goalen to comply with the recommendations of Vatican II. During the re-order, Goalen commissioned a large Christus Resurrexit for the sanctuary wall by Steven Sykes."]}, {"page": "Our Lady and St Brigid's Church, Northfield", "response": ["A mission was established in 1918 in Steel Road.
