His style fused modern, traditional and international influences, although in his ecclesiastical work he often favoured neo-byzantine or romanesque. A review of his work published in 1938 said that he had designed 80 schools and over 40 churches.  At this stage he was mid-career and continued practicing for a further 30 years. His buildings are predominantly brick, although often with steel or concrete structural support.", "link_mentions": {}}}
