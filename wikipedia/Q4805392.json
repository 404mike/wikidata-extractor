In 2009, he joined League One club Wycombe Wanderers on loan. This was followed by a loan period with League Two club Grimsby Town. He signed for Conference Premier club York City on loan in November 2010 before signing permanently.

Parslow scored his only goal of 2010\u201311 in this match after scoring the opening goal with a header from a free kick taken by Ashley Chambers. Having played at right-back the following match, he returned to playing at centre-back after McGurk's injury in York's 0\u20130 draw away to Altrincham on 22 February 2011. Parslow formed a central defensive partnership with Chris Smith, and manager Gary Mills praised him by calling him \"outstanding\". He had played in all of York's matches in 2010\u201311 before suffering a head injury following a clash of heads with Matthew Barnes-Homer in a 1\u20130 home win against Luton on 19 April 2011, which led to him missing the remainder of the campaign.

Eight days later Mills took his York team back to Wembley Stadium for the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final, and following a 2\u20131 victory over Luton Town with goals from Ashley Chambers and Blair, York were promoted to League Two, ending an eight-year absence from the Football League.
