He worked at Apollo Cotton as an assistant to Daniel West who was a family friend. A relative, William West had an interest in telescopes and microscopes as an evening amusement and this sparked off a scientific interest in John Caldecott. In 1832 he was posted as a commercial agent at the Indian port of Allepey (now Alappuzha) and he saw the need for an astronomical observatory there. This idea was aired in 1836, supported by the Resident Colonel James Stuart Fraser and approved by Raja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma of Travancore. An observatory was constructed at Trivandrum. The building was constructed by Captain Horsley of the Madras Engineers. Opened in 1837, Caldecott was appointed as director. Two mural circles, a transit and equatorial telescopes were installed at the observatory. In April 1841, he also brought in instruments to measure the magnetic field of the Earth. He was interested in examining the magnetic field of the Earth at various parts, a scheme inspired by Alexander von Humboldt.
