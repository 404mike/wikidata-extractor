On 1 September, he reported to 21 (Training) Squadron at Netheravon for elementary air instruction.Greenhous 2002, p. 38. The first aircraft he trained in was the Avro 504, flown by Roger Neville.McCaffery 1988, p. 26. Bishop was adept at taking aerial photographs, and was soon in charge of training other observers with the camera. The squadron was ordered to France in January 1916 and arrived at Boisdinghem airfield, near Saint-Omer, equipped with R.E.7 reconnaissance aircraft.McCaffery 1988, pp. 28\u201329. Bishop's first combat mission was as an aerial spotter for British artillery.McCaffery 1988, p. 29. At first, the aircraft could not get airborne until they had offloaded their bombload and machine guns.McCaffery 1988, pp. 31\u201332. Bishop and pilot Neville flew over German lines near Boisdinghem and when the German howitzer was found, they relayed coordinates to the British, who then bombarded and destroyed the target.McCaffery 1988, pp. 34\u201335.
