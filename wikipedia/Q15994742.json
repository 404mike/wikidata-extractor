At the end of his indenture in January 1780 he came to London to study under John Hunter, and was appointed house apothecary or house surgeon to the Westminster Hospital. There he came under the influence of Henry Watson, the surgeon and professor of anatomy at the Royal Academy. He acted as house surgeon for about 18 months, and worked as a dissector. John Sheldon engaged him to assist in his private anatomical school in Great Queen Street."]}, {"page": "John Higton", "response": ["John fell in love with Mary Sheldon, the cousin of John Sheldon who was at that time Professor of Anatomy at the Royal Academy, and they were married in 1794. They lived in Southwark, London, and attended church at St Mary's, being acquainted with William Blake. Higton was well known to a number of publishers including Wheble and his friend John Nichols.", "Higton's patrons included Lord Sedley, for whom he executed a number of paintings, particularly relating to dogs, and George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick. It had also been speculated that John FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory was also a Patron given Higton's painting of Dogs at Ampthill Park. It was thought that Higton was introduced to George Greville by Lord Sedley, a friend of Charles Francis Greville. However it is now understood that Greville's wife, Henrietta Vernon, was a cousin of Lord Sedley (later Venables-Vernon) via her father Richard Vernon, and the half sister of John FitzPatrick, Lord Gowran (later 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory) via the first marriage of her Mother (Lady Evelyn Leveson-Gower). Therefore, Higton's portraits of Warwick Castle, combined with those of Dogs belonging to George Greville, Lord Sedley, and John Fitzpatrick, perhaps reflect a more intimate relationship with the family, and their circle, than was understood. The Greville's were acquainted to John Sheldon, Wheble and Nichols who were also Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1784", "response": ["# John Sheldon (1752\u20131808), anatomist and surgeon   "]}, {"page": "Lewis Loch\u00e9e", "response": ["On 16 October 1784, from Loch\u00e9e\u2019s property in Chelsea, there was a pioneering ascent by two balloonists, Jean-Pierre Blanchard and John Sheldon.Simon de Mare, Little Chelsea, Then & Now (2013), p. 2.
