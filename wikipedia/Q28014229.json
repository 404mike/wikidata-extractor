After challenging a racist rule in which white missionaries earned more than their black counterparts, Blackman resigned as a priest and dedicated himself to both communism and black civil rights activism. He was a key member of the Negro Welfare Association and the League of Coloured Peoples, and an active member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). During his career as a communist party activist, he became close friends with American civil rights leaders Paul Robeson and W. E. B. Du Bois. He worked as a radio broadcaster for the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) during the Second World War for their Caribbean services, however in 1950 he was fired from his job for having communist beliefs. Afterwards he joined the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) and volunteered to write letters for people with learning disabilities. In his later life he dedicated his time to writing poetry.", "link_mentions": []}}
