Davies was back the next season, playing two games in the championship though after the highs of the previous season, Wales lost all their games to end up with the Wooden Spoon. Davies missed the entirety of the 1938 tournament, but was back for the 1939 championship, playing in all three games. In the last match against Ireland Davies scored all seven points with a try and a drop goal for Wales. His drop goal was the last four point drop goal ever scored in the Five Nations Championship, and the last for Wales until the end of World War II.

Evans first game was against England at the Cardiff Arms Park under the captaincy of Tom Parker. Wales won in style, scoring a then record eight tries. All five Swansea players representing Wales in that match scored, Evans, Parker, Bowen and Palmer all scored tries, and Joe Rees completed two conversions. Evans was back on the scoresheet in his very next match, scoring a very late drop goal to grab a draw against Scotland at Inverleith.Godwin (1984), pg 135. Evans scored in both remaining games of the tournament, scoring tries in both wins over Ireland and then France. In the game against France, Evans was not originally chosen to play, but shortly before the kick-off the Welsh selectors dropped Frank Palmer and Harold Davies, and replaced them with Evans and Cliff Richards. Although becoming a Championship winner and scoring in every international game, Evans was not selected to represent Wales after 1922. This was due to having to retire from rugby because of a serious cartilage injury to his knee.

Played at home at St Helen's, Wales faced England, who had finished the previous season as home nations Grand Slam winners. Under the captaincy of Joe Rees, Pugh was one of nine new Welsh caps in the team who would eventually lose 17-9 to England. Pugh was reselected for the next game of the tournament, away to Scotland, but this was an even worse result than the English game, with the Welsh team letting in eight tries. Six of the Wales team never played for the national team after this match, though the selectors kept faith in Pugh for the next match against Ireland. After Jack Whitfield's lone spell as captain in the Scotland game, the Welsh were now led by Rowe Harding, though the result remained the same. In a close game at the Cardiff Arms Park, Pugh scored his only international points when he scored one of two Welsh tries, though this was not enough to gain victory over the Irish team. In the final game of the tournament, Pugh found himself again selected, the only forward to have played in all four matches of the Championship.Smith (1980), pg 204."]}, {"page": "William Rees (rugby)", "response": ["Rees was the younger brother of the rugby union footballer; Joe Rees."]}, {"page": "Joe Rees (rugby union, born 1990)", "response": ["Joe Rees (born 31 August 1990) is a Welsh rugby union player.
