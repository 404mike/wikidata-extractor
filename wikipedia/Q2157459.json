Joining the Church Missionary Society in 1836 he was and his friend Rev Dr James Lewis were shapers of the new Church of Scotland Mission.  Of his many Scottish friends, Dr Robert Hall was a leading academic, a powerful orator, with a large retentive memory whose impulsive liberalism formed his early beliefs.  They helped him publish a pamphlet English Education in India which formed part of his address to the General Assembly of the Kirk in Edinburgh in 1837, which he dedicated to the students of the four ancient universities.  A passionate advocate of reform he banished corporal punishments for girls, striving to Christianise education through humane methods of teaching.  In seeking out W.H.Pearce for a new Baptist mission, he emphasised the inter-denominational character of united prayer events. He was unassuming, modest, pious, and quite uninterested in the politics of popery and anti-papism.  Yet only the Episcopalians remained beyond his reach with their broad brush Quarterly publications.  Despite the perceived handicap he could influence serious political figures in the Indian civil Service through the media of Calcutta Review.  In one article he made an advancement in liberal theology exposing the cruelty of Female Infanticide in Central and Western India (1844).  And in the same year his power in the Free Church was rehearsed in a lecture to The Free Churchmen of Calcutta in the Masonic Hall.  Its title \"The Sole and Supreme Headship of the Lord Jesus Christ over His Own Church, or a voice from the Ganges relative to the courses which led to the recent disruption...\" symbolised his conviction in the supremacy of Christianity to bring enlightened education to Indians.  Two Bengali intellectuals travelled to Edinburgh to be baptised at Duff's request.  Mahendra Lal Bazak and Khailai Chandra Mukherjya were closely watched by Dr Thomas Chalmers, a renowned writer and church leader.  Dr. Chalmers death in 1847 was a real blow to the Free Church; and to Duff, his pupil and then successor as professor.  It forced Duff to deny his Scottishness to maintain a life dedicated to working in India, he refused the principalship in 1874.  Duff knew him well in the cultural capital of Scotland pursuing moral, material and spiritual development while steering his charges away from the temptations of Heathenism.  During 1845-6 he conducted numerous Indian conversions with typical missionary zeal. Exhibiting a strong sense of Scottish character he personified individual freedoms baptizing Jewish refugees, overcoming prejudice, and persisting in the face of prohibitive rules among the Hindu caste system.  A tireless campaigner, and restless traveller from Calcutta to Ceylon he visited thousands of missionaries and their stations. A profound sense of duty was monitored by legal correctness of his own opinions, that never ceased to improve.  Deeply rooted in the doctrine of justification by faith alone he mixed doctrinal worship with regular business committees to raise money for the church.  Eloquent, he recalled the poems of Ossian as closely as he expounded the values of liberal Zionsim.  Richly endowed by a Jacobite tradition that informed a fierce feeling of injustice.  On being appointed Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1851 he was asked by Lord Granville to testify to the House of Lords in which he hoped to influence the Wood's Educational Despatch of 1854. Disappointed by the slow progress of change, he embarked on a trip to America.  At Washington DC Dr Duff addressed the Congress.  In Toronto he gave a sermon to Kroom's Church.  On his last day he preached at the Broadway Tabernacle where he received benediction.  Hugely popular, he was bade farewell by weeping crowds from the Hudson River wharves on 13 May 1854.  Back in England he was met by Lord Haddo, son of Prime Minister, Lord Aberdeen.  After sipping the Malvern Spa waters for a cure, he decided on a Grand Tour of Europe and the Holy Land with his friend Dr Lumsden."]}, {"page": "List of Christian preachers", "response": ["* Robert Hall (1764\u20131831) "]}, {"page": "Isaac Taylor", "response": ["From 1812 to 1816 he wintered in the west of England, and he spent most of this time at Ilfracombe and Marazion in the company of his sister, Jane.
