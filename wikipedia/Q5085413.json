He was a supporter of the Liberal Party. He ran businesses throughout his career, with little success, and was declared bankrupt in July 1909 after his outfitting shop was damaged by fire. During the 1910s he ran a public house (despite being a teetotaller) and later pursued an interest in the film industry by buying shares in numerous Stretford cinemas in the 1930s. He also starred in 1926 picture The Ball of Fortune, playing himself as a football trainer; the film received generally positive reviews. In 1928, together with former colleague Charlie Roberts he became a coach for the ambitious but short-lived Manchester Central. Meredith's son-in-law, former City captain Charlie Pringle, was a player. He retained a passion for football, and spent much of his retirement discussing the game with former colleagues and regulars at his hotel, the Stretford Road Hotel, which he ran from 1930 to 1945. He rarely missed the chance to attend a Wales game in the 1920s and 1930s."]}, {"page": "Pringle", "response": ["* Charlie Pringle (born 1894), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Charlie Pringle||  || Half back || 1922\u20131928||216||1|| ||"]}, {"page": "1926 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||Half-back|| Charlie Pringle"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Charlie Pringle"]}, {"page": "Charles Pringle", "response": ["#redirect Charlie Pringle"]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|  || Charlie Pringle                                      || MF ||  1 || 0 ||  1"]}]}}
