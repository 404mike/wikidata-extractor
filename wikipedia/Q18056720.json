His father was a pupil of the pioneering surgeon Astley Cooper. Key joined the Royal Navy in August 1833. After initial training at the Royal Navy College at Portsmouth, he spent his early career in the third-rate HMS Russell in the Mediterranean Fleet and then, from 1839, in the sixth-rate HMS Cleopatra on the North America and West Indies Station."]}, {"page": "Edward Grainger", "response": ["Grainger was born in Birmingham and was the elder son of Edward Grainger, who was a surgeon and later the author of Medical and Surgical Remarks (1815). After receiving medical instruction from his father, he entered as a student at the united hospitals of St. Thomas's and Guy's in October 1816. He was a dresser to Sir Astley Cooper, who advised him to open an anatomical school in Birmingham after he had become a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. When Charles Aston Key was appointed demonstrator of anatomy by Cooper, Grainger was anxious to be made joint demonstrator with him. Failing in that, he opened an anatomical school and dissecting-room of his own in June 1819. Grainger's school was located in the large attic of a tailor's house in St. Saviour's Churchyard, Southwark."]}, {"page": "Hunterian Society", "response": ["* 1832\u201334 Charles Aston Key"]}, {"page": "Joseph Henry Green", "response": ["In 1820 he was elected surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital, on the death of his cousin, Henry Cline the younger. In 1824 he became professor of anatomy at the College of Surgeons,  delivering four annual courses of twelve lectures on comparative anatomy, using the textbook of Carl Gustav Carus. In 1825 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In the same year he became professor of anatomy to the Royal Academy, then located at Somerset House, where he lectured a year on anatomy in its relation to the fine arts. He retired from this post in 1852. From 1818 he had shared the lectureship first on anatomy and then on surgery at St. Thomas's with Sir Astley Cooper, who retired in 1825, and wished to assign his share of the lectures to his two nephews, Bransby Cooper and Charles Aston Key. Green, who had paid Cooper \u00a31,000 for his own half share, acquiesced, but the hospital authorities did not, whereupon Sir Astley started lectures in connection with Guy's Hospital, which had up to that time sent its pupils to the medical school of St. Thomas's."]}]}}
