Morrison returned to the City team in a League Cup game against Ipswich in December 2000. However, due to the number of yellow cards he had picked up in reserve-team games he could not play Premier League football until New Year's Day 2001, when he played in a 1\u20131 draw with Coventry City. In his next outing, an FA Cup game against Birmingham City, he scored with a bullet header in a 3\u20132 victory (Darren Huckerby and Shaun Goater scored the other goals for City). Morrison made two further appearances for City in the league: a 4\u20130 defeat to Leeds United and a 1\u20131 draw with Liverpool. In the latter, Morrison was replaced, by Andrei Kanchelskis (on loan from Rangers), at half time, due to a hamstring injury. Morrison was forced to withdraw from the squad, which drew 1\u20131 with Middlesbrough in early February, due to the same hamstring injury (he was replaced, in the squad, by Shaun Wright-Phillips). Morrison played in City's 1\u20130 victory against Coventry City in the fourth round of the FA Cup (in which Goater scored the only goal). Morrison also played in the fifth round of the FA Cup, against eventual winners Liverpool (which ended in a 4\u20132 defeat). Morrison was spoken to by a police officer for squirting water at a Liverpool fan after he had been replaced by Tony Grant. After the game, Royle dismissed speculation that Morrison had played his last game for the club. However, the defeat did prove to be Morrison's last appearance for City, as Royle became concerned about his injury record. Morrison was subsequently loaned out to Sheffield United, who were then managed by Neil Warnock. Morrison played alongside another former Manchester City captain, Keith Curle, in defence at Sheffield United. The wisdom of allowing Morrison to be loaned out was questioned when Howey suffered an injury whilst playing for City. Morrison made his debut for Sheffield United in a 4\u20131 defeat to Gillingham. He came on as a substitute, replacing Gus Uhlenbeek, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon in United's next game, in which he almost scored a late equaliser."]}, {"page": "Des Hamilton", "response": ["He left St James' Park in 2001 for Cardiff City. His new manager Alan Cork praised Hamilton, and fellow new signings Spencer Prior and Graham Kavanagh for their experience and immediately blending into the squad.

Bonner played a key role in the club's promotion to Division Two, forming a central midfield partnership with Willie Boland, stating that the pair did the \"donkey work\" to allow the rest of the team to focus on attacking. Having come close to leaving the side in March 2003 after falling out of favour under manager Lennie Lawrence, Bonner commented \"I got my head down, trained hard and have forced myself back into the side\". He also revealed that he had considered handing in a transfer request to Lawrence several weeks prior."]}]}}
