He retained his first team place under new boss Billy Dougall, and bagged 14 goals in 42 games in the 1957\u201358 season.

Ahead of Burnley's first home match of the season against Everton at Turf Moor, Potts wrote in the club's matchday programme: \"We pride ourselves on being a footballing team and no club can be more eager to meet the demand for better play. That being so strongly ingrained in our intentions we confidently anticipate providing you with good displays\".Quelch (2015), p. 74 The team defeated Everton 5\u20132, with two goals from Connelly, and one each from Pilkington, Pointer and Robson. A 3\u20131 defeat at home against West Ham United followed, despite taking the lead through Connelly, before Everton were beaten 2\u20131 in the reverse fixture after being 1\u20130 down. Burnley's form remained inconsistent: a 4\u20131 away loss against Chelsea was followed by two 2\u20131 wins at home against Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, after coming from behind on both occasions. McIlroy picked up an injury against West Brom, after he landed on his shoulder following a hard challenge from Maurice Setters.Quelch (2015), pp. 87\u201388 Potts had selected the same starting line-up for the first seven matches, but he made several changes to his side before the reverse fixture against local rivals Preston on 15 September: McIlroy was replaced by Billy White, while Bobby Seith had contacted giant urticaria and was replaced by Cummings, leaving the left-back position open for the 18-year old Elder to make his debut.Simpson (2007), p. 295 Burnley lost the fixture 1\u20130 but Elder played well against his opponent Tom Finney and remained in the starting line-up."]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 in English football", "response": ["* 7 February 2020: Brian Pilkington, 86, England, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers and Bury winger."]}, {"page": "2020 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Brian Pilkington, 86, English footballer (Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Barrow)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2020", "response": ["*Brian Pilkington, 86, English footballer (Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Barrow).Former England international winger Brian Pilkington has passed away at the age of 86"]}, {"page": "History of Burnley F.C.", "response": ["In the 1955\u201356 season, Burnley reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, where they were knocked out by Chelsea after four replays. On his senior debut in 1957, 17-year-old Ian Lawson scored a club record four goals against Chesterfield in the FA Cup third round. In the next round, Burnley tied their largest  victory when they beat New Brighton by a scoreline of 9\u20130. The side reached the sixth round but were eliminated by Aston Villa after a replay.Simpson (2007), pp. 281\u2013284 In 1958, former Burnley player Harry Potts was appointed manager. His side mainly revolved around captain Jimmy Adamson and Jimmy McIlroy, the team's playmaker, while his squad consisted mostly of players who were recruited from the club's youth academy. Only two players, McIlroy and Alex Elder, cost a transfer fee, with both players bought from Northern Irish club Glentoran for \u00a38,000 (the equivalent of \u00a3 as of ) in 1950 and \u00a35,000 (the equivalent of \u00a3 as of ) in January 1959, respectively.Simpson (2007), p. 292 Potts often employed the then unfashionable 4\u20134\u20132 formation and implemented a playing style which later became known as Total Football. Jimmy Greaves labelled Burnley's style of play as \"smooth, skilled football that was a warming advertisement for all that was best about British football\". The side endured a tense 1959\u201360 season, in which Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers were the other contenders for the league title. Burnley won their second First Division championship on the last day with a 2\u20131 victory at Manchester City with goals from Brian Pilkington and Trevor Meredith. Although Burnley had been in contention all season, they had not led the table until the last match was played. The Daily Mirror noted: \"Burnley, the team of quiet men\u2014five of them are part-timers and the whole outfit cost less than \u00a315,000\u2014snatched the First Division Championship from the teeth of the famous Wolves\".Quelch (2015), p. 189 With 80,000 inhabitants, the town of Burnley became one of the smallest to have an English first-tier champion. After the season ended, the squad travelled to the United States to represent England in the International Soccer League, the first modern international American soccer tournament. Burnley defeated Bayern Munich (West Germany), Glenavon (Northern Ireland) and Nice (France) but finished runners-up in the group stage behind Scottish side Kilmarnock."]}]}}
