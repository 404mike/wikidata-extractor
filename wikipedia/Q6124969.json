In his banking career, as chief manager (effectively chief executive) from 1962, and chairman from 1964 to 1972, Saunders was at the helm of Hong Kong's most important financial institution at a time when the Crown Colony was rapidly changing from a trading post to a regional centre of manufacturing and finance.\nThe fierce pace of economic growth for Hong Kong was fuelled by an influx of industrious migrants from China and an administration dedicated to laissez-faire tax and trade policies. From 1966, however, domestic business confidence and dealings with mainland China were severely disrupted by Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. In 1967 the devaluation of sterling \u2013 to which Hong Kong's currency was then fixed \u2013 was another blow.\nSaunders led the bank through these events with a calming hand. In its centenary year, 1965, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was offered a majority stake in the Hang Seng Bank, a local retail bank which had suffered a sudden run on deposits after rumours that it was in trouble.\nSaunders was out of the colony when the crisis arose, but returned to complete the negotiation. In the same period, he broadened The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's own customer base to include a new generation of Chinese (often Shanghainese) entrepreneurs, and acquired for the bank an early equity stake in the World-Wide Shipping Group, the shipping empire of Sir Yue-Kong (\"Y.K.\") Pao, with whom Saunders formed a close friendship.\nThe bank also invested in the Swire family's Cathay Pacific airline. Its branch network expanded, and it was a frontrunner in computerisation.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation", "response": ["Michael Turner became Chief Manager in 1953 and set about diversifying the business. His tenure came to an end in 1962 having established The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation of California 1955 and having acquired The British Bank of the Middle East and the Mercantile Bank (based in India) in Aug 1959. Turner was succeeded in 1962 by Jake Saunders. In 1964 the Chief Managership was superseded as the top executive role in the bank by an Executive Chairmanship. Saunders took this role until retirement in 1972 and was succeeded as Chief Manager in 1964 by H.J. Shen, the managing director of Maysun Trading Co. and the former head of the Central Trust of China, who became the first ethnic Chinese to be appointed to the position of Chief Manager of the bank. Under Saunders' tenure the bank continued to expand. 1965 saw the bank purchase a controlling interest in Hang Seng Bank of Hong Kong, and 1972 the formation of a merchant banking arm, Wardley Limited.", "# Sir Jake Saunders (1962\u20131964)"]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Jake Saunders, banker (born 1917)"]}, {"page": "Saunders", "response": ["* Jake Saunders  (1917\u20132002), British banker in Hong Kong"]}, {"page": "Sir John Saunders", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jake Saunders  "]}, {"page": "John Anthony Holt Saunders", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jake Saunders"]}, {"page": "Yue-Kong Pao", "response": ["With the approaching fall of the \"Bamboo Curtain\", Pao and all his family had moved to Hong Kong by the spring of 1949, having managed to remit much of the family's assets and money before events made it impossible. It was impossible to resume a banking career and, given the prevailing uncertainties, he did not wish to commit to investing in machinery and land in Hong Kong, so Pao started an Import/Export business dealing in Chinese goods. Following the UN trade embargo resulting from China's entry into the Korean War, the company broadened its scope to Europe, although trade with China continued in a circuitous way through skilful exploitation of legal loopholes in the embargo. It was during the first half of the 1950s that Pao first made contact with Jake Saunders (who was running the Imports Department) and Guy Sayer (also working in the department) at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Both were later to become Chief Manager and Chairman of the bank, and the relationship was to be a decisive element in the growth of Pao's businesses."]}, {"page": "1917 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 29 July \u2013 Jake Saunders, banker (died 2002)"]}, {"page": "John Saunders", "response": ["*Jake Saunders or Sir John Saunders (1917\u20132002), chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2002", "response": ["*Sir Jake Saunders, 84, British banker."]}]}}
