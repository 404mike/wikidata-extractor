A six-month stay at Odessa in the Soviet Union in the second half of 1933, following Hitler's seizure of power in Germany, led Bomberg on his return to London to immediate resignation from the Communist Party. During World War II, he painted Evening in the City of London (1944), showing the blitzed city viewed rising up to a triumphant, surviving St Paul's Cathedral on the horizon, since described as the \"most moving of all paintings of wartime Britain\" (Martin Harrison); a series of flower paintings saturated with turbulent feeling; and his single commission as a war artist, a series of \"Bomb Store\" paintings (1942) expressing Bomberg's expanded first-hand sense of the destructive powers of modern technology in warfare. These \"Bomb Store\" paintings convey a premonitory sense of the massive explosion that destroyed the underground store two years later, killing 68 people, and bear comparison with Piranesi's Carceri etchings."]}, {"page": "Francis Bacon (artist)", "response": ["A first, incomplete catalogue raisonn\u00e9 was compiled by curator Ronald Alley in 1964.Alexander Adams (21 July 2016), All together now: on the Francis Bacon catalogue raisonn\u00e9  The Art Newspaper.
