After a brief and unsuccessful stay at Bury, he was signed by Ernie Tagg, manager of Crewe Alexandra, then in the Fourth Division, where his skill caught the eye of a number of bigger clubs. In October 1971 he was signed by Carlisle United, at the time a Second Division club, scoring 13 goals in 36 appearances for the club.

Long time regular Bill Robertson sustained an injury in the 1959\u201360 season, and Hickson was drafted in to provide cover. He played ten Second Division matches in December through to March but was dropped after conceding five away at Liverpool and Tommy Younger took his place for the remainder of the season.

He joined his hometown club Crewe Alexandra in 1962, and played 43 of the club's 46 Fourth Division games as promotion was achieved in 1962\u201363. He then featured 30 times in the 1963\u201364 season, as Jimmy McGuigan's \"Railwaymen\" were relegated straight back out of the Third Division.

He was loaned to Fourth Division side Port Vale in August 1968, as manager Gordon Lee needed cover for the injured Stuart Sharratt. Described as a \"part-time, pipe-smoking civil servant\", he featured for the \"Valiants\" in the next twenty matches, but was recalled by Crewe in November that year. He later played for Southport, and played three Third Division games for the \"Sandgrounders\". He also had a loan spell with Shrewsbury Town, but did not take to the field at Gay Meadow. He later emigrated to South Africa to play for Cape Town City."]}, {"page": "Roy Gater", "response": ["Gater passed through the Port Vale youth team to sign professional forms under Norman Low in April 1960. He made his debut on 4 April 1961, in a 1\u20131 draw with Coventry City at Highfield Road. He played one further Third Division game in 1960\u201361, and was also a member of the side that won the Supporters' Clubs' Trophy. He only made three league and two FA Cup appearances at Vale Park during the 1961\u201362 season. He was sold to Bill McGarry's Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic for a \"small fee\" in June 1962. The \"Cherries\" finished fifth in the Third Division in 1962\u201363, before new boss Reg Flewin took the club to fourth in 1963\u201364 and 11th in 1964\u201365.
