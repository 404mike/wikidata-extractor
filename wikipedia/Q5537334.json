In the second year of the Great Irish Famine, Browne's tenants gathered at Westport House, the ancestral residence of the Marquesses of Sligo. Browne assured his tenants of his support for them, and proceeded to hand them guns (without regard for his own safety), enabling them to hunt for game. He also went into considerable debt in order to acquire cornmeal from the Americas, and converted most of Westport House into a soup kitchen for the starving peasants.He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Percy Smythe, 6th Viscount Strangford", "response": ["* Louisa Ellen Frances Augusta Smythe (1823\u20131852), who married George Browne, 3rd Marquess of Sligo in 1847."]}, {"page": "George Browne", "response": ["*George Browne, 3rd Marquess of Sligo (1820\u20131896), Irish peer"]}, {"page": "Hubert Thomas Knox", "response": ["He was the third son of Charles Knox of Ballinrobe, who would later be High Sheriff of Mayo in 1860 and was a colonel in the North Mayo Militia.
