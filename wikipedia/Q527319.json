He was known as \"Sir West Ridgeway\".he was involved in the sodomy and child molestation charges against Hector Archibald MacDonald , commander of British forces in Ceylon . Ridgeway ordered MacDonald's return to London, careful to prevent the huge scandal that was to be expected: \"Some, in fact most of his victims ... are the sons of the most respected men in the colony, British as well as locals,\" he wrote, noting that he was able to convince the local press to hold still so \"no more dirt comes to light\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hector MacDonald", "response": ["Historian Ronald Hyam comments that \"Ceylon furnished MacDonald with a lethal combination of a military command which was inactive and uninteresting, and a community of boys who were interesting and very active.\"Ronald Hyam, \"Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience\" (Manchester University Press, 1990) pp.33\u201334 He ruffled the feathers of the civilians by forcing the unkempt and ill-disciplined local militia, most of them the sons of British planters, to show more spit and polish; he deeply offended the Governor, Sir Joseph West Ridgeway, when he yelled at him to get off the parade ground; and compounded the process of alienation by declining the social invitations of the British community and consorting instead with the locals.Robert F. Aldrich, \"Colonialism and Homosexuality\" (Routledge, 2003), p.188 Rumours began circulating that he was having a sexual relationship with the two teenage sons of a Burgher named De Saram, and that he was patronising a \"dubious club\" attended by British and Sinhalese youths. Matters came to a crisis when a tea-planter informed Ridgeway that he had surprised Sir Hector in a railway carriage with four Sinhalese boys; further allegations followed from other prominent members of the colonial establishment, with the threat of even more to come, involving up to seventy witnesses. Ridgeway advised MacDonald to return to London, his main concern being to avoid a massive scandal: \"Some, indeed most, of his victims ... are the sons of the best-known men in the Colony, English and native\", he wrote, noting that he had persuaded the local press to keep quiet in hopes that \"no more mud\" would be stirred up."]}, {"page": "North Borneo Chartered Company", "response": ["| Joseph West Ridgeway"]}, {"page": "Ballasalla", "response": ["St Mary the Virgin, Abbey Church was built from local limestone sourced from Scarlett Point south of Castletown, with the foundation stone being laid in 1895 by Lady Ridgeway, the wife of the then Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Joseph West Ridgeway.
