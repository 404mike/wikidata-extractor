Morrison's 2005 album Magic Time was dedicated to him, as he had died within weeks of completion of the recording. The album credits described him as \"a respected colleague and fine performer who brought a unique flavour to many of [the album's] tracks.\"Some of the many artist Lyttle has played with include Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Brian Kennedy, The Chieftains, Marianne Faithfull, Liam Neeson, Harry Nilsson, Phil Everly, Gene Pitney, Acker Bilk and Elton John.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Van Morrison", "response": ["Morrison's 2005 album, Magic Time, debuted at number twenty-five on the US Billboard 200 charts upon its May release, some forty years after Morrison first entered the public's eye as the frontman of Them. Rolling Stone listed it as number seventeen on The Top 50 Records of 2005. Also in July 2005, Morrison was named by Amazon as one of their top twenty-five all-time best-selling artists and inducted into the Amazon.com Hall of Fame. Later in the year, Morrison also donated a previously unreleased studio track to a charity album, Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now, which raised money for relief efforts intended for Gulf Coast victims devastated by hurricanes, Katrina and Rita. Morrison composed the song, \"Blue and Green\", featuring Foggy Lyttle on guitar. This song was released in 2007 on the album, The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3 and also as a single in the UK. Van Morrison was a headline act at the international Celtic music festival, The Hebridean Celtic Festival in Stornoway, Outer Hebrides in the summer of 2005."]}, {"page": "Foggy (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Foggy Lyttle, British guitarist"]}, {"page": "Magic Time (Van Morrison album)", "response": ["The title song is about a nostalgic searching of the past in order to capture a magic moment almost lost in memory.  \"The Lion This Time\" is a continuation over thirty years later of \"Listen to the Lion\" that first appeared on his album  Saint Dominic's Preview. There is a nursery rhyme quality to it as with its predecessor and a delicate use of a classical string arrangement.  Thom Jurek with Allmusic says:  \"The acoustic 'The Lion This Time' is one of the finest ballads Morrison has cut in decades. Period.\"  \"Gypsy in My Soul\" is also reminiscent of a song \"Gypsy\"  from Saint Dominic's Preview.  \"Just Like Greta\" and \"Stranded\" have similar themes of being lost in an alien world with only oneself to rely on.  \"Celtic New Year\" is reminiscent of Irish Heartbeat, an album with The Chieftains. An Allmusic review calls it \"trademark Morrison; the long, loping, repetitive line that is his trademark fuels this one.  It's carried by the interplay between Morrison's acoustic and Foggy Lyttle's electric guitar fills, and aided by Chieftain Paddy Moloney's whistle.\" \"Carry On Regardless\" is a singing list of \"Carry On Films\" that Morrison seemed to have a special fondness for.Rogan, No Surrender, p. 488-492", "\"This album is dedicated to the memory of Foggy Lyttle who played on most of the tracks.\"", "* Foggy Lyttle \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Days Like This (Van Morrison album)", "response": ["*Foggy Lyttle\u00a0\u2014 electric guitar on \"Raincheck\", \"You Don't Know Me\" and \"I'll Never Be Free\""]}, {"page": "What's Wrong with This Picture?
