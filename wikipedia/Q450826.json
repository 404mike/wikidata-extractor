Gwenllian was the daughter of Gruffudd ap Cynan (1055\u20131137), Prince of Gwynedd and Angharad ferch Owain, and a member of the princely Aberffraw family of Gwynedd. Gwenllian's \"patriotic revolt\" and subsequent death in battle at Kidwelly Castle contributed to the Great Revolt of 1136.\nThere are several notable artistic depictions of Gwenllian, often depicting her with a sword in hand, or riding a chariot into battle in the style of Boudicca. She is sometimes confused with Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn, who lived two centuries later.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
