He bases his argument on observations about human language acquisition and describes a \"poverty of the stimulus\": an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic competence they attain. For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered, in that language. To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky referred to this difference in capacity as the language acquisition device, and suggested that linguists needed to determine both what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that result from these constraints would constitute \"universal grammar\". Multiple scholars have challenged universal grammar on the grounds of the evolutionary infeasibility of its genetic basis for language, the lack of universal characteristics between languages, and the unproven link between innate/universal structures and the structures of specific languages. Scholar Michael Tomasello has challenged Chomsky's theory of innate syntactic knowledge as based on theory and not behavioral observation. Although it was influential from 1960s through 1990s, Chomsky's nativist theory was ultimately rejected by the mainstream child language acquisition research community owing to its inconsistency with research evidence. It was also argued by linguists including Robert Freidin, Geoffrey Sampson, Geoffrey K. Pullum and Barbara Scholz that Chomsky's linguistic evidence for it had been false."]}, {"page": "Preposition and postposition", "response": ["* Huddleston, Rodney, and Geoffrey K. Pullum.

For example, an article titled \"Ultra-processed foods 'linked to cancer'\" covered a study which suggested a link but acknowledged that its findings were not definitive.  Linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum characterizes this practice as mendacious, noting that the single-quoted expressions in newspaper headlines are often not actual quotations, and sometimes convey a claim that is not supported by the text of the article. Another technique is to present the claim as a question, hence Betteridge's law of headlines."]}, {"page": "Relative clause", "response": ["A relative clause is typically a clause that modifies a noun or noun phrase,Rodney D.

Pullum, A Student's Introduction to English Grammar, CUP 2005, p. 183ff. and uses some grammatical device to indicate that one of the arguments within the relative clause has the same referent as that noun or noun phrase. For example, in the sentence I met a man who wasn't there, the subordinate clause who wasn't there is a relative clause, since it modifies the noun man, and uses the pronoun who to indicate that the same \"man\" is referred to within the subordinate clause (in this case, as its subject).", "*Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K.

Sampson writes that there are many references in Syntactic Structures to Chomsky's own The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (LSLT) in matters regarding the formal underpinnings of Chomsky's approach, but LSLT was not widely available in print for decades. Nevertheless, Sampson's argument runs, Syntactic Structures, albeit \"sketchy\", derived its \"aura of respectability\" from LSLT lurking in the background. In turn, the acceptance of Chomsky's future works rested on the success of Syntactic Structures. In the view of British-American linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum, Syntactic Structures boldly claims that \"it is impossible, not just difficult\" for finite-state devices to generate all grammatical sentences of English, and then alludes to LSLT for the \"rigorous proof\" of this. But in reality, LSLT does not contain a valid, convincing proof dismissing finite-state devices."]}, {"page": "Unaccusative verb", "response": ["In nominative\u2013accusative languages, the accusative case, which marks the direct object of transitive verbs, usually represents the non-volitional argument (often the patient).

As Perlmutter points out, the same verb such as \"slide\" can be either unaccusative or unergative, depending on whether the action was involuntary or voluntary.Perlmutter (1978), p. 163. The term \"unaccusative verb\" was first used in a 1978 paper by David M. Perlmutter of the University of California, San Diego.Google ngrams.  Perlmutter credited the linguist Geoffrey K.
