It's music by recipe: You to take hyper-macho hard rock and tone it down so it will appeal to the over-17 set. You need a simple hook that can be repeated a dozen or so times, lots of electric guitar solos, a standard rock beat and basic lyrics.\" John Spinks said in 1986 interview with the Los Angeles Times that he was very influenced by \"the music that gives me a rush\" and that he \"grew up on the Beatles\". Interestingly, it was also said that the band wanted to be a \"car stereo sort of poppy version of the band Rush. \"61 Seconds and \"Mystery Man\" are evidence of this.

The song's lyrics have no basis in reality: \"Josie\" was not a real person, and the song is an entirely invented story. Afterwards, the band began recording demos for their debut album Play Deep with producer William Wittman, who had also worked with Cyndi Lauper and the Fixx.
