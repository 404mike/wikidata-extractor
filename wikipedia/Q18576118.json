Her mother's name is unknown but her father was William Byrne, a notable engraver who specialized in landscapes. Anne was the oldest of her four other siblings, all of whom went on to become artists themselves. Mary Byrne Green was the second oldest Byrne sibling, a student of Swiss painting, and specialized in miniature painted landscapes. Letitia Byrne was the youngest Byrne sister, and she became popularized for her etchings and engravings, a craft that William Byrne passed down to his children. Her work also focused mainly on landscapes. John Byrne was the youngest of the five Byrne children and he lived with his sister Elizabeth Byrne. They specialised in landscapes, although his medium of choice was watercolor. Anne Frances Byrne and her siblings grew up helping in their father's engraving shop and learned artistic techniques from him before going off on their own to study under masters. Anne Frances Byrne died in January 1837 at the age of 62."]}]}}
