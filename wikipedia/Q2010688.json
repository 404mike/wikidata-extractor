Swill milk dairies were noted for their filthy conditions and overpowering stench both caused by the close confinement of hundreds (sometimes thousands) of cows in narrow stalls where, once they were tied, they would stay for the rest of their lives, often standing in their own manure, covered with flies and sores, and suffering from a range of virulent diseases.

She also wrote serial novels for The Ladies' Pictorial and a group of other provincial journals. She and her husband returned to Devon in 1884, where Pender Cudlip would serve as Vicar of Sparkwell for 25 years. She continued writing single-volume novels for such publishers as Chatto & Windus around the start of the 20th century. However, she began experiencing financial problems within a few years and applied to the Royal Literary Fund in 1907 and 1908. In the latter year she claimed that the highest offer she had received for her latest novel was \u00a315. Her husband died in 1911 and Annie Cudlip died seven years later on 24 November 1918."]}, {"page": "Matt Morgan (cartoonist)", "response": ["He came to the United States in 1870 under an engagement with Frank Leslie, and, after working as caricaturist on Leslie's publications, acted as manager of several New York theatres. His greatest fame came during the 1872 presidential campaign, when Morgan drew cartoons on behalf of the Liberal Republicans against President Ulysses S. Grant.  Hired as a rival to the Republican cartoonist Thomas Nast at Harper's Weekly, Morgan showed much the same caustic satire, but lacked the humor and wit that Nast employed.  His caricatures of politicians he approved of were more like portraiture. By 1874, 'Leslie's Illustrated Weekly' was using Morgan's cartoons only sporadically, and relying more on those of Joseph Keppler, but Morgan continued to do illustrations of events and American scenes. He went in 1880 to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he was manager of the Strobridge Lithograph Company until 1885, and did much to improve the character of theatrical lithography. He also founded the Matt Morgan Art Pottery Company there in 1883, and the Cincinnati Art Students' League. Reportedly he also helped design sets for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show."]}, {"page": "Angola Horror", "response": ["The accident, dubbed the \"Angola Horror\", gripped the imagination of the nation. Accounts of the tragedy, accompanied by grisly illustrations, filled the pages of newspapers for weeks and showed the tragedy of those trying to identify their loved ones among the charred remains that were pulled from the wreckage. Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper carried five sketches of the scene and concluded, \"This railroad disaster is accompanied by more horrible circumstances than ever before known in this country, and its results are truly sickening to contemplate\"."]}]}}
