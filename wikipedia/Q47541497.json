He also became the Chief justice of the Madras High Court from 1871 to 1879.\nMorgan was born in Llantrisant, Glamorgan, Wales, the son of Walter Morgan, and educated at King's College London. He entered the Middle Temple, and was called to the Bar 22 November 1844. His early years in the profession were uninspiring, and his progress slow, leading him to consider other employment, until he conceived of going to India.Morgan served as a puisne judge at Calcutta (where, with his mastery of equity law, he was considered 'one of the most well-informed legal men' there) before being promoted to Chief Justice at Allahabad, where he served from 1866 to 1871, having also been knighted. While Swami Vivekananda's father Vishwanath Datta applied to be enrolled as an attorney-at-law, Morgan approved the prayer. His reputation continued to increase during this period, which stood him in good stead to take the position of Chief Justice at Calcutta, Bombay or Madras. With no opening at Calcutta or Bombay, Morgan was appointed Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, where he remained until 7 February 1879. Although Morgan was respected during his time at Madras, he was not a loved figure to either the Bar or the public; some were critical of him, and he was perceived as 'chill' and 'colourless'.Morgan died in 1903, having lived at Eastbourne. His eldest son, Walter, married Caroline, granddaughter of Sir David Hunter-Blair, 3rd Baronet. Fifth son Harington Morgan (d. 1914), a barrister of the Middle Temple and judge in the Civil Courts of Justice in Sudan, married Lilian Elizabeth Lutley (daughter of Philip Lutley Sclater and Jane Anne Eliza, daughter of Sir David Hunter-Blair, 3rd Baronet; Lilian was therefore a first cousin of Caroline Hunter-Blair, mentioned above).", "link_mentions": {}}}
