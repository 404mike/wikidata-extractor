Of the 26\u00a0tour matches, he played in 17, only bettered by captain John Dawes and \"Mighty Mouse\" prop Ian McLauchlan. By the time of the first Test in Carisbrook, John had faced six teams, including the New South Wales Waratahs and the New Zealand M\u0101ori. All six games had been won by the Lions and John had recorded 88 points, including a full house against Waikato. In the First Test John terrorised New Zealand's fullback Fergie McCormick with ruthless tactical kicking. The All Blacks were shunted all over the field by John, who was well protected by his forwards, something that he was not afforded with Wales in 1969. The Lions won the Test 9\u20133, six of the Lions' points coming from two John penalties; McCormick never played for the All Blacks again."]}, {"page": "Llanelli", "response": ["*Carwyn James (1929\u20131983), Wales, coach of Llanelli and British Lions"]}, {"page": "David Duckham", "response": ["In the late 1960s and thereafter he was played on the wing for his country and in 1971 was part of the successful British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.David Duckham. lionsrugby.com Encouraged by coach Carwyn James, he found an attacking freedom that was lacking in the English game.
