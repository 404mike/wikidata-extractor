The club finished in sixth place, just four points short of promotion. However, due to the club's precarious financial situation a total of thirteen players were released. He made ambition plans for the 1975\u201376 season, though he failed to land Wales internationals Mike England and Wyn Davies. Instead he signed striker Mick Cullerton from Stafford Rangers for \u00a34,000, and midfielders Terry Lees (a \u00a33,000 signing from Stoke City) and Geoff Morris (a \u00a3200 signing from Bangor City). Cullerton hit 21 goals, but Vale could not repeat their efforts of the previous season and had to make do with a twelfth-place finish.", "For the 1976\u201377 season he was forced to sell Terry Lees to Sparta Rotterdam for \u00a325,000 (representing a \u00a322,000 profit in the space of twelve months). He added to his squad with youngsters Ian Osborne and Kevin Kennerley, and experienced midfielder Geoff Davies. After Cullerton suffered a cartilage injury he signed Ken Beamish for a \u00a312,000 fee from Blackburn Rovers, as well as former Wigan Athletic forward John Rogers for 'a small fee'. His team struggled with poor discipline \u2013 Rotherham manager Jimmy McGuigan claimed Vale were 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Midway through the season Sproson sold two more key players: striker Ray Williams went into non-league football for 'a small fee' and midfielder Colin Tartt joined Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. Sproson brought in Alan Lamb from Preston North End and Peter Sutcliffe from Stockport County for a combined outlay of \u00a38,000. Ultimately though, the loss of star midfielder Brian Horton to Brighton for \u00a330,000 in March 1976 was something Sproson proved unable to remedy.

He scored five goals in 20 games in 1999 and 4 goals in 31 games in 2000. Burke eventually returned to Europe after his contract expired in Japan and spent some time training with Fortuna Sittard again before signing for Rapid Bucharest on a short-term contract in March 2001, making him the first English footballer to ever play in Romania.
