As one of the brave ones \u2014 and one of Britain's most shameless writers \u2014 HP Tinker has been peddling his own brand of surrealism for years now, in stories littered with pop cultural references where you are likely to meet Dorothy Parker, Tom Paulin, Paul Gauguin as you are Dean Martin and Morrissey.\" (Dogmatika website)[2]\nThe Times has praised his \"hilarious deadpan surrealism\", The Independent thought him \"unusual, arresting, smart and very funny\" and The Guardian remarked that he \"fizzes with the kind of zany, surreal conjunctions that recall Barthelme and Pynchon in their prime.\"In 2010 HP Tinker appeared in the 200th edition of Ambit magazine alongside Sir Peter Blake and Jonathan Lethem.\nHis story \"Alice In Time & Space and Various Major Cities\" was included in The Best British Short Stories 2012.\nAuthor Lee Rourke devoted a chapter to HP Tinker in A Brief History of Fables, describing his work as \u201ca grand symphony of intertextuality, tomfoolery and theoretical intent\u201d.A second collection of short stories, The Girl Who Ate New York, was published in 2015. In his review, the novelist David Rose commented, \"John Ashbery described the late Lee Harwood as Britain\u2019s best-kept secret; H.P.
