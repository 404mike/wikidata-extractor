His Nouveaux principes d'\u00e9conomie politique, ou de la richesse dans ses rapports avec la population (1819) represents the first liberal critique of laissez-faire economics. He was one of the pioneering advocates of unemployment insurance, sickness benefits, a progressive tax, regulation of working hours, and a pension scheme. He was also the first to coin the term proletariat to refer to the working class created under capitalism, and his discussion of mieux value anticipates the concept of surplus value. According to Gareth Stedman Jones, \"much of what Sismondi wrote became part of the standard repertoire of socialist criticism of modern industry,\" earning him critical commentary in the Communist Manifesto."]}, {"page": "2004 in literature", "response": ["*Gareth Stedman Jones \u2013 An End to Poverty?Queen Mary University of London School of History Retrieved 11 July 2017."]}, {"page": "Walter Besant", "response": ["*Gareth Stedman Jones, Outcast London: A Study in the Relationship between Classes in Victorian Society (Oxford: Clarendon, 1971)."]}, {"page": "Sheila Rowbotham", "response": ["Rowbotham attended St Hilda's College at Oxford University and then the University of London. She began her working life as a teacher in comprehensive schools and institutes of higher or adult education. While attending St Hilda's College, Rowbotham found the syllabus with its heavy focus on political history to be of no interest to her. She has described herself at the time she started her studies at St Hilda's as \"not at all left-wing\" and a \"mystical beatnik hippie-type\", although she soon started to make contact with leftists, including fellow Oxford student Gareth Stedman Jones, who became a professional historian. Rowbotham also met E. P. Thompson and Dorothy Thompson at this time, after a tutor recommended that she should visit them due to their interest in Chartism and the history of working-class movements: Rowbotham read the proofs of E. P. Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class, which she has described as \"like no other history book I\u2019d read\". Through her involvement in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and various socialist circles, among them the Labour Party's youth wing, the Young Socialists, Rowbotham was introduced to Karl Marx's ideas. Soon disenchanted with the direction of party politics, she immersed herself in a variety of left-wing campaigns, including writing for the radical political newspaper Black Dwarf, whose editorial board she also joined."]}, {"page": "Gareth Jones", "response": ["*Gareth Stedman Jones (born 1942), British historian"]}, {"page": "Rajnarayan Chandavarkar", "response": ["Chandavarkar grew up in Bombay before going to England for his advanced education.

This approach, which starts from simple category and gradually unfolds into complex categories, employed \"internal\" criticism that finds contradiction within and between categories while discovering aspects of reality that the categories cannot explain. This meant that Marx had to build his arguments on historical narratives and empirical evidence rather than the arbitrary application of his ideas in his evaluation of capitalism."]}, {"page": "John Heffernan (British actor)", "response": ["| 2020 || Misbehaviour || Gareth Stedman Jones || "]}, {"page": "Peter Sch\u00f6ttler", "response": ["* (ed.)
