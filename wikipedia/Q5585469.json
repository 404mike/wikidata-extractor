After the 5th-place finish of 1965\u201366 followed a succession of seasons fighting to avoid relegation. In 1966\u201367 City finished 15th and Parr made 38 appearances at right half in a defence of Mike Gibson, Tony Ford, Alec Briggs, Parr, Jack Connor and Gordon Low that missed only 7 games between them in the whole season. The same defence played in the 5th round FA Cup tie as City lost 2\u20130 at Tottenham Hotspur."]}]}}
