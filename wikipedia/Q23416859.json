He succeeded Sam Walsh in July 2016. He was succeeded by Jakob Stausholm in early 2021.\nHe resigned as CEO in 2020 following a week of international controversy over Rio Tinto's destruction of Juukan Gorge, a priceless Australian Aboriginal sacred site which had evidence of 46,000 years of continual human occupation.Jacques had been named by the Harvard Business Review as one of the world's best chief executives prior to his departure of Rio Tinto in 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rio Tinto (corporation)", "response": ["In May 2020, to expand the Brockman 4 mine, Rio Tinto demolished a sacred cave in Juukan Gorge, Western Australia, which had evidence of 46,000 years of continual human occupation, and was considered the only inland site in Australia to show signs of continual human occupation through the last Ice Age. Rio Tinto later apologised for the distress caused and CEO Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques subsequently stepped down.", "In September 2020, it was announced that the company's Chief Executive Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques, along with two executives, will resign because of Rio Tinto's role in destroying two ancient rock shelters in the Pilbara region of Australia. The company's Chief Financial Officer, Jakob Stausholm became the new Chief Executive on 1 January 2021.", "On 11 September 2020, it was announced that, as a result of the destruction at Juukan Gorge, CEO Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques and two other Rio Tinto executives would step down. The National Native Title Council (NNTC) welcomed the move, but said that there should be an independent review into the company's procedures and culture to ensure that such an incident could never happen again. Rio Tinto admitted their error, issued an apology via media and on their website, and also committed to building relationships with the traditional owners as well as getting Indigenous people into leadership roles in the company. One analysis of what went wrong in Rio Tinto to allow the destruction to occur suggested that processes failed at several levels, but mainly due to its \"segmented organisational structure\", a poor reporting structure, and Indigenous relations not being properly represented at a high enough level."]}, {"page": "Jean-Sebastien Jacques", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques"]}, {"page": "Jakob Stausholm", "response": ["Stausholm joined Rio Tinto in September 2018 as an executive director and chief financial officer (CFO).
