The home side took the lead after 21 minutes through Willie Haines, who scored again in the second half after Sam Taylor had equalised with a goal on his debut before the break. New signing Murdoch McKenzie also scored a debut goal late on to secure a 3\u20131 win for Pompey, sending them to the top of the league table. Southampton's season picked up quickly after this opening loss, as they embarked on a short run of six games without a loss, including wins over mid-table sides Middlesbrough and Gateshead, and promotion hopefuls Chelsea, the latter of which included Bill Rawlings scoring his first hat-trick since the penultimate game of the 1923\u201324 season. After the first seven games of the season the club were eighth in the table, the highest position they had held in the division since finishing seventh in 1924\u201325."]}]}}
