Although Hibs conceded the first goal due to a series of defensive errors, David Wotherspoon scored a quick equaliser on his senior debut and Abdessalam Benjelloun scored a late winner. Inconsistent form in the early part of the season saw Hibs win their first two games, lose the next two, but then win the following two league matches. These results put Hibs tied with Rangers on points for second place in the league, but manager John Hughes commented that it would be a position that Hibs would be unlikely to hold for the rest of the season. Hughes put this inconsistency down to the team's failure to work hard enough in the games they had lost."]}, {"page": "Patrick Deane", "response": ["Deane played in the youth and reserve teams for Hibernian, and was part of the side that won a youth league and cup double in 2009.

Without making an appearance for the first team, however, Deane was released by Hibs towards the end of the summer 2009 transfer window. New manager John Hughes had decided that Deane, David van Zanten and Jonatan Johansson were surplus to his requirements.
