The next game at the Reebok Stadium came that weekend; another local derby this time against Wigan Athletic. Bolton took the lead when Lukas Jutkiewicz got a toe on Robert Hall's free-kick on 31 minutes and went into half-time with the lead still intact. Substitutions changed the game, however; Uwe R\u00f6sler brought on Manchester United loanee Nick Powell while Dougie Freedman brought on Alex Baptiste - back from a one-game suspension following his red card against Yeovil Town - in an unfamiliar holding midfield position while also shifting Medo Kamara to the wing. Powell proceeded to score on the 88th minute, firing home from Martyn Waghorn's cross, while Baptiste conceded a second penalty in two games, forcing \u00c1d\u00e1m Bogd\u00e1n to rescue the point for Bolton; saving Jordi G\u00f3mez's spot-kick high to his right.", "|16||MF||align=\"left\"| Mark Davies"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["Lennon's first game came against Birmingham City at St. Andrew's, against whom he had made his Football League debut as a player for Manchester City. Matt Mills headed in from a corner to give Bolton a lead they managed to hang on to despite Craig Davies missing a penalty while striker Lee Novak was in goal, having replaced the sent off Darren Randolph. Following this, Neil Lennon was sent to the stands as he had left his technical area too many times throughout the match. This was Bolton's second win of the season, and lifted them off the bottom of the table, to be replaced by Blackpool. At The Valley, Charlton scored either side of half-time to go 2\u20130 up, before Dean Moxey scored his first for the club to make the score 2\u20131 just a few minutes later, but the team couldn't score an equaliser, giving Lennon his first taste of defeat as Bolton manager. At home for the first time, Neil Danns and Mark Davies scored while Jon Toral did so for Brentford. Ensuring the win, Craig Davies scored with Brentford's 'keeper up the pitch to make it 3\u20131. With 10% more possession but 10 fewer shots, Bolton fell to Norwich City at Carrow Road in front of the Sky cameras.

Brentford slipped to 12th place in league with the game ending in a second 0\u20130 draw. An unchanged line-up travelled to Bolton for the final game of October. An even first half finished goalless before Bolton broke the deadlock with an opener from Neil Danns. Alan McCormack was stretchered off and replaced by Tommy Smith before Mark Davies added a second for the home team. Substitute Jon Toral grabbed his first goal for the Bees but as the team sought an equaliser David Button was caught away from goal after moving upfield for a corner, and a quick move from Bolton allowed Craig Davies to net Bolton's third and secure the points."]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|16||Mark Davies||CM||||Willenhall||||183||16||Wolverhampton Wanderers||26 January 2009||Undisclosed||2017", "|16||MF|| Mark Davies                      ||9||0||0||0||0||0||9||0"]}]}}
