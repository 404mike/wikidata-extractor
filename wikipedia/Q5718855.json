She disagreed with Florence Nightingale and with Henry Burdett about registration of nurses.  She believed that there was a need for training to a recognised standard and this meant confining entry to the profession to the daughters of the higher social classes. She opposed paying nurses in training, because it attracted the wrong sort of girl.

The fever wards are Grade II listed and are a testament to how voluntary hospitals dealt with nineteenth century epidemics of contagious disease."]}]}}
