Soon after SACU was set up, with the escalation of the Vietnam War, the international situation deteriorated, and at the same time the Cultural Revolution was launched. These developments placed great strain on the organisation. The historian, Hugh Trevor-Roper, a prominent founder member, resigned in June 1966 after he was criticised by members for launching an attack on the Cultural Revolution in The Sunday Times headlined \u2018The sick mind of China\u2019.Buchanan, Tom (2012).

It is in part owing to SACU's legacy that Chinese cultural and other events are today part of the fabric of life in cities and communities across Britain."]}, {"page": "Derek Bryan (diplomat)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Derek Bryan"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2003", "response": ["*Derek Bryan, 92, British diplomat, sinologist and teacher."]}]}}
