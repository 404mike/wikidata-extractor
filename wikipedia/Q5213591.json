In the first series, he is released from prison and seeks out Uncle Andy, who believes Red Hand Luke wants to kill him for not helping him escape the police. Instead, Red Hand Luke tells Uncle Andy about his conversion and thanks Uncle Andy for allowing him to be arrested. In spite of his violent tendencies, he is quite child-like, and a huge \"Shugo\" Duncan fan. He tends to beat people up, usually Uncle Andy and Big Mervyn, when he doesn't get his way. The duo live in fear of each time he (literally) bursts through the front door. However, he does have brief moments of clarity where he realises that his actions may be the reason why he suffers negative consequences. He is best friends with Pastor Begbie and the only character that doesn't fear him. At the end of the original run, he converts to Islam in order to get arrested so he can be sent back to prison, where he longs to return. Uncle Andy and Big Mervyn attempt to break him out of the specially constructed prison in the middle of Belfast Lough. He falls into the Lough, protesting that he cannot swim. His fate is left ambiguous, but he is never mentioned again.
