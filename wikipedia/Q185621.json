By further coincidence he too had formerly operated a locomotive works in Bow, but this was not a private concern but the depot of the North London Railway. In 1865 the Society of Engineers, London, made direct comparison between the bogie with the india-rubber lateral bearing of William Adams and the radial axle box of William Bridges Adams: during trials on the North London Railway the laterally sprung bogie was thought superior to the radial axle, but when William Adams moved to the LSWR he adopted the axle box designed by his rival Bridges Adams. The locomotives now known as Adams Radials are named after the Locomotive Superintendent, but they are famous for the axle invented by William Bridges Adams."]}, {"page": "William Adams", "response": ["William Adams may refer to:", "*William Adams (Royal Navy officer, died 1748), British naval officer", "*William Adams (Royal Navy officer, born 1716) (1716\u20131763), British naval officer", "*William Adams (pilot) (1564\u20131620), English sailor and samurai in Japan", "*Willy Northpole (William Adams, born 1980), rapper signed to Ludacris' DTP Records", "*William Adams (British Columbia politician) (1851\u20131936), rancher and politician in British Columbia, Canada", "*William Adams (1752\u20131811), MP for Totnes", "*William Adams (New Zealand politician) (1811\u20131884), New Zealand politician", "*William Adams (locomotive engineer) (1823\u20131904), British locomotive engineer", "*William Adams (Master of Pembroke) (1706/7\u20131789), English scholar", "*William Adams (oculist) (1783\u20131827), English ophthalmic surgeon", "*William Adams (cricketer) (1885\u20131957), English cricketer", "*William Adams (footballer), footballer who played for Walsall and West Bromwich Albion", "*William Adams (wrestler), British wrestler", "*William Adams (author) (1814\u20131848), English religious writer", "*William Adams (Dedham) (1650\u20131685), minister of the First Church and Parish in Dedham", "*William Adams (minister) (1807\u20131880), American religious leader and college president", "*William Adams (haberdasher) (1585\u20131661), London haberdasher and founder of Adams' Grammar School", "*William Adams (lawyer) (1772\u20131851), English lawyer, helped negotiate settlements with the US c.1814/1815", "*William Adams (potter) (c. 1746\u20131805), North Staffordshire potter, founded the Greengates Pottery", "*William Adams (mining engineer) (1813\u20131876)", "*William Adams (lifesaver) (1864\u20131913), English lifesaver from Gorleston"]}, {"page": "LSWR A12 class", "response": ["The A12 locomotives of the London and South Western Railway were built between the years 1887 and 1895 to the design of William Adams.
