In the Victorian era, the painting Edward\u00a0II and Piers Gaveston by Marcus Stone strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit. It was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872 but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive. More recently, the director David Bintley used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet Edward\u00a0II, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward\u00a0II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th\u00a0century."]}, {"page": "Hobson's choice", "response": ["** Hobson's Choice, a 1989 ballet by David Bintley"]}, {"page": "Hobson's Choice (play)", "response": ["An English ballet adaptation of the same title, with choreography by David Bintley and music by Paul Reade, premiered on 13 February 1989 by Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, London.\"PR: Birmingham Royal Ballet's 2011 Tour To Hong Kong\"  ballet.co.uk, 6 January 2011Abad-Carles, Ana \"Birmingham Royal Ballet, 'Hobson's Choice' \" Ballet-Dance Magazine, December 2005 A video production of the ballet has been seen on television broadcasts and released on DVD.\"'Hobson's Choice', Studio: Arthaus DVD, Release Date: 2 May 2006\" amazon.co.uk, accessed 30 January 2011"]}, {"page": "Birmingham Royal Ballet", "response": ["Sir Peter Wright was the company's Artistic Director from 1977 until his retirement in 1995, when David Bintley was appointed Artistic Director.
