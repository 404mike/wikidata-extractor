He now represents New Zealand. Chris has won two World Championships in Association Croquet, in 1995 and again in 2008, six AC World Team Champs and one GC World Team Champs. 2008 was perhaps Chris's finest year, overtaking previous world champions Robert Fulford and Reg Bamford to regain the position of world number one player, which he held for in excess of 16 months. He also reached the semi-finals of the [1] WCF Golf Croquet World Championships in March 2008 in Cape Town, South Africa and led the English team to the finals of the [2] 2009 European team championships.\nClarke now lives in Christchurch, New Zealand. On 30 January 2008 he was married to Jenny Clarke (n\u00e9e Williams), who plays for New Zealand. The pair were therefore due to be on opposing sides when Great Britain played New Zealand in the 2010 MacRobertson Shield, before Clarke withdrew with a back injury.\nIn October 2012, Clarke returned to competitive association croquet singles, having won multiple Open doubles titles in the meantime as well as GC singles events where he rose to world number 2. In November 2012, he completed the requisite ten matches needed to return to the world rankings, which he did in first place. Clarke switched to represent New Zealand following his controversial non-selection for England's golf croquet squad, and was a member of their victorious 2014 MacRobertson Shield team, playing at number 1 where he was the winningmost player in the event.\nIn 2016, Clarke played his last International event involving singles when he captained NZ to win the GC World Championship, once again being the winningmost player in the event. This victory made Clarke the first player to win three of the four WCF Open World Titles. He finished his career having won 9 World titles and never having lost a major International Test Match.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Fulford (croquet player)", "response": ["| style=\"background:#98FB98;\"|Winner||1991||Open Championship||Chris Clarke||+14otp +26tp -8 +26tp", "| style=\"background:#98FB98;\"|Winner||1994||World Championship||Chris Clarke||-12tpo +12tp +18tp +13", "| style=\"background:#FFA07A;\"|Runner-up||1995||World Championship||Chris Clarke||-18tp +12tpo -26tp +26tp -26", "| style=\"background:#98FB98;\"|Winner||2000||NZ Championship||Chris Clarke||+26tp +26tp", "*1994: won (beat Chris Clarke -12tpo, +12tp, +18tp, +13)", "*1995: runner-up (lost to Chris Clarke -18tp, +12tpo, -26tp, +26tp, -26)", "*2008: S/F (lost to Chris Clarke +26tp, +26tp, -11tpo, -17, -26)"]}, {"page": "Reginald Bamford", "response": ["| style=\"background:#98FB98;\"|Winner||1993||Men's Championship||Chris Clarke||+tpo, +tp, +tp", "| style=\"background:#98FB98;\"|Winner||1994||Open Championship||Chris Clarke||+16tp, +26", "| style=\"background:#98FB98;\"|Winner||2002||Open Championship||Chris Clarke||+12, +26sxp, +26sxp"]}, {"page": "Chris Clarke", "response": ["Chris Clarke may refer to:", "* Chris Clarke (sprinter) (born 1990), English sprinter", "* Chris Clarke (boxer) (born 1956), Canadian boxer", "* Chris Clarke (croquet player) (born 1971), English croquet player", "* Chris Clarke (footballer) (born 1980), English footballer", "* Chris Clarke (politician) (1941\u20132009), British Liberal Democrat politician", "* Chris Clarke (soccer) (born 1978), Canadian soccer player", "* Chris Clarke (EastEnders), fictional character on BBC soap opera EastEnders"]}, {"page": "World Croquet Federation", "response": ["|  Chris Clarke", "|  Chris Clarke", "|  Chris Clarke"]}, {"page": "Croquet Association", "response": ["| Chris Clarke", "| Chris Clarke", "| Chris Clarke", "| Chris Clarke", "| Chris Clarke", "| Chris Clarke", "| Chris Clarke", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "|Chris Clarke & David Maugham", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "| Chris Clarke & Robert Fulford", "| Chris Clarke & Jenny Williams", "|Chris Clarke & Jenny Clarke"]}]}}
