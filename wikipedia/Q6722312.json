According to a 1968 Paul McCartney interview with Radio Luxembourg, it was during this time that Donovan taught Lennon and McCartney finger-picking guitar styles including the clawhammer, which he had learned from Mac MacLeod. Lennon used this technique on songs including \"Dear Prudence\", \"Julia\", \"Happiness is a Warm Gun\" and \"Look at Me\", and McCartney with \"Blackbird\" and \"Mother Nature's Son\".", "Donovan's next single, in May 1968, was the psychedelic \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\".
