He had an immense loyalty to his home club and spent his entire life in the village where he was born.  In 1904 Evans received his one and only international call-up, becoming the first player to be directly capped from Blaina RFC. Evans was brought into the Wales team to face England in the opening game of the 1904 Home Nations Championship, captained by Cardiff's Gwyn Nicholls. Evans was only one of two news caps in the Welsh squad for the encounter, the other being David John Thomas from Swansea; both men coming into the pack. The game ended in a draw, after a late try from Teddy Morgan was disallowed to prevent a Welsh victory.Griffiths (1987), pg 4:11. The Welsh selectors responded by bringing in five new caps for the next match, and Evans was one of those replaced."]}]}}
