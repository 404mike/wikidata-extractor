When recording the role, the team used blue screen in order to allow Liotta to visualise \"how it's gonna move\". The team ensured that the player felt \"real affinity\" for Tommy, making the narrative a key development interest. Dan Houser described Tommy as \"strong and dangerous and prepared to wait for the right opportunity to arrive\". Director Navid Khonsari recalled Liotta frequently complaining on set and found him difficult to work with as a result. \"In some sessions he was ... into it, but then sometimes ... he was very dark and couldn't work\", said Sam Houser.

In the previous year, the United Kingdom-based DMA Design and BMG Entertainment had just released Grand Theft Auto, and while it financially performed well but was not a critical success in Europe, it had sparked controversy over the use of violence in video games, with United States Senator Joe Lieberman speaking out strongly against it. Seeing the opportunity to capture attention on the game, Brant had initiated the acquisition of BMG as to acquire the Grand Theft Auto property, and at the same time, contacted BMG's Sam and Dan Houser (both instrumental to getting Grand Theft Auto to market), Terry Donovan, and Jamie King to found a new label within Take-Two, called Rockstar Games for which to develop more titles like it. Electronic Arts' (EA) 2008 CEO, John Riccitiello, stated that, with the establishing of Rockstar, Take-Two effectively invented the \"label\" corporate structure, which EA followed into in 2008.

Producer Dan Houser said there were about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game, while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000. The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model. Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.", "When designing the game world, the team initially created a \"hybrid city\", which Dan Houser described as \"a post industrial Midwest slash east coast generic\" city. Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design on a real location meant \"you have a lot of things you can say about it\". As a result, they redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in the first Grand Theft Auto (1997), basing it loosely on New York City. DMA Design worked with a team at Rockstar in New York for cultural references; the Rockstar team would regularly work long hours for full weeks, ensuring that the references, such as in-game car manufacturers, were appropriate to the city.", "The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing Brooklyn and Queens, a commercial centre resembling Manhattan, and suburbs similar to New Jersey. The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to \"start out feeling poor and work to being richer\". Dan Houser described Liberty City as a \"hybrid of a generic American city\", including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia; he felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously. Sam Houser cited films and shows like Heat (1995) and The Sopranos (1999\u20132007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game. He also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario 64 and the 1990 film Goodfellas, describing Grand Theft Auto III as \"a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG\".", "The team developed the story and design simultaneously. Dan Houser said, \"we use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story\"; however, he found it difficult to create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic \"rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy\". The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity. Dan Houser felt that each mission is \"its own short story\", and part of an \"overarching story\". Dan Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films and the mafiosi featured in films by Martin Scorsese; the team also \"paid a lot of attention\" to shows like Miami Vice and The Sopranos. When writing the story, Dan Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with post-it notes to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.", "Chatterbox FM, one of the game's radio stations, is entirely talk radio hosted by Lazlow Jones, who met Rockstar's managing director Terry Donovan in 2001 as they were both preparing to travel to Los Angeles for E3. Donovan invited Jones to Rockstar's offices in Manhattan, where he met the development team, including Dan and Sam Houser and producer Jamie King, and they invited him to work on the game. The writing sessions took place at Dan Houser's apartment, and the entire process, including editing and recording, took around four to five months. With the station's guests and callers, the writers wanted to satirise American lifestyles, focusing on fictional stories as opposed to quickly outdated stories based on recent news. Jones found the conversations to be natural, having worked in radio for several years. The roles of the guests and callers were performed by Jones' friends and neighbours, including his father, and were recorded in New York.", "One of the changes made shortly after the 9/11 attacks was the colour scheme of the police cars, which were originally blue with white stripes and resembled that of the New York City Police Department. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Other changes included altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper and removing a mission referencing terrorists, as well as some changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio. Another cut to the game was the character of Darkel, a revolutionary urchin who vowed to bring down the city's economy. When references to Darkel were found in the game's code, speculation arose that he was related to 9/11, but Dan Houser explained that the character had been cut \"months before [release]\". There are also reports and previews stating that the game featured school children as pedestrians prior to release, although Rockstar has dismissed such rumours as \"nonsense\".", "Prior to and since the release of Grand Theft Auto III, the game generated several controversies. GameSpy awarded it with the title of \"Most Offensive Game of the Year\", calling it \"absolutely reprehensible\". They wrote that the game rewards players for \"causing mayhem\" and \"killing innocent people by the dozen\", ultimately questioning its appropriateness within the industry. The notoriety of Grand Theft Auto III resulted in American retailer Wal-Mart's decision to check the identification of purchasers who appeared to be under the age of 17 when purchasing mature titles. In an essay, assistant professor Shira Chess identified the lack of conclusion to player violence, due to the ability to respawn upon death or incarceration, and found that it denies the \"reality of mortality and simultaneously [forces] it on players\". When speaking about the game's depiction of violence, producer Leslie Benzies claimed that is intended to be comedic, and that the game is \"not meant to be taken seriously\". Producer Dan Houser stated that the team was conscious of the offence that the game would attract, but \"never marketed it in a way that exploited that\".", "Grand Theft Auto III is considered to have a leading role in the popularisation of sandbox games, inspiring those such as Crackdown, Mafia, Saints Row, True Crime, and Watch Dogs. The term \"Grand Theft Auto clone\" is frequently used to describe subsequent video games released with similar open-ended gameplay as Grand Theft Auto III. While previous video games used open world design, including earlier Grand Theft Auto games, Grand Theft Auto III took this gameplay foundation and expanded it into a 3D world, offering an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions. Journalist and consultant Tom Bramwell felt that the game did not invent a lot of its gameplay features, but \"brought them all together\". Due to its greater success over its predecessors, it is credited with popularising the open-world genre; Dan Houser felt that the game made it \"one of the most vibrant genres today\", and Garbut felt that it led to the complexities of Rockstar's future open world games, including the later Grand Theft Auto titles and Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018). IGNs Jack Harwood wrote that the game's talk radio station inspired similar inclusions in other open world games, such as Mafia III (2016) and Watch Dogs: Legion (2021).", "The game also led the trend of mature video games; Dan Houser felt that it allowed other developers to create violent shooters. Hal Halpin, president of the Entertainment Consumers Association, described Grand Theft Auto III as the \"lightning rod for the violence-in-games debate\". Metros Roger Hargreaves wrote that it \"emboldened a whole new wave of games that were [...] fixated with violence [and] gang culture\". Greg Ford of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt that the game allowed the medium to handle mature subject matter in a more serious manner than previously perceived, and noted the improvement of video game classification as a result of its controversy.

The team did not look at the previous renditions of Liberty City as inspiration, wanting it to retain the \"general feel\" but nothing else. The map is roughly three times the size of Grand Theft Auto IIIs. The developers originally considered using the entire state of New York, before restricting it to Manhattan, and then expanding it out again. They considered including more suburbs with woods, and would regularly vote on which areas to include. Art director Aaron Garbut said that the team chose the setting because of the detail and variety it provided, describing New York as \"an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city\". Writer Dan Houser added that the team \"wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold\" due to the amount of research required for the world; Rockstar Games's main headquarters are located in New York. The team consciously avoided a precise recreation of New York City to allow for more enjoyable game design, selecting the areas that they felt \"characterised it the best\". Garbut wanted to capture a caricature of the city as he felt that most people were familiar with \"the highlights\" from film or literature but did not need to know the areas precisely. The city was not built with specific missions in mind; the area was created first, and missions implemented later.", "Dan Houser described Liberty City as \"the biggest character\" of the game. The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition of Liberty City is more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series; although smaller than San Andreas, the setting of the previous main game, the developers considered it comparable in scope due to city's verticality, number of buildings, and level of detail. The team wanted less dead spots and irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas. They wanted the game to be \"a more focused experience\" than San Andreas, and Dan Houser felt that the limited activities of New York allowed this. The team felt that the addition of Niko's mobile phone added to the immersion of the world and represented society's shifted focus on phones. The in-game brands and products are designed over several years; the billboards were implemented in the game around six months prior to release.", "The game's script, written by Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries, is about 1,000 pages. Approximately 660 actors provided voices for the game over 80,000 lines of dialogue. After conceiving the character and setting, Dan Houser spoke with his brother Sam Houser and Benzies to bounce story ideas before writing a rough synopsis, a six-paged, detailed document. Once the synopsis was reworked, the designers broke it into missions, represented by a large flow document demonstrating each section. The writers then work on the introductions to the missions; the gameplay dialogue comes much later. Unlike previous Grand Theft Auto games, Grand Theft Auto IV does not have cinematic influences. \"We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't to try and do a loving tribute or reference other stuff,\" said Dan Houser. He said that the writers wanted something \"fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [a] movie\". Dan Houser felt that the quality of the writing had to improve alongside the advancements in graphics and technology. He noted that the improvements in facial animation allowed for slower-paced cutscenes. The unique dialogue that plays when a mission is retried was to ensure that the gameplay felt \"less canned and less like Groundhog Day\".", "Dan Houser described Niko Bellic as \"a more rounded character\" than those in previous games. He felt that his dual personality\u2014often saving innocent people, while also being a \"cold-hearted killer\"\u2014made him more relatable. He also felt that Niko's unfamiliarity with Liberty City allowed for the player to relate to him more, only driven by his vague past and relationship with Roman. When deciding on Niko's background, the writers felt that being an immigrant could lead to more dangerous situations, and therefore more enjoyable missions; after discussions with criminal experts, Dan Houser found that \"the real scary characters are not born in America anymore\". He felt that Niko's outsider view of American culture was \"fun\". The team wanted Niko to be \"more of an anti hero than a hero, capable of making positive actions within his criminal world\". They wanted his demeanour to reflect the weight of his past and choices.", "Niko's design underwent a few changes, but was finalised early in development. His outfit underwent several changes based on Eastern Europeans, particularly photographs of men fighting in winter wars in Yugoslavia and Chechnya. The primary motivation for the design was a face to convey the appropriate emotions and a body that could move nicely with the new animations. The in-game purchasable outfits were also designed to fit with the character. The team ensured that the gameplay choices presented to the player were not too extensive, as they still had to make sense to the character, who is driven by the people around him. Dan Houser felt that the missions in San Andreas had become too linear, and wanted to present choices to the player in Grand Theft Auto IV.", "The writers found that Niko needed a motivation to come to America, so they created his cousin, Roman. Dan Houser felt that the two could not be brothers as there would be a deeper level of familiarity than necessary. He described the two as a double act, with Roman's fantasist charm playing off Niko's tough cynicism. The team gave other non-playable characters (NPCs) more definable behaviours and dialogue to make them feel more alive. The writers initially considered having a smaller group of characters, but found that the story became boring and that players were less likely to explore the world. The stranger characters found in the game world were based on the \"crazy people\" that populate New York, according to Dan Houser, which in previous games were only able to be captured through radio stations or mild pedestrian behaviours. The team based the ethnicities, clothing, and behaviours of the NPCs on the photographs and videos that they captured around New York, divided into different areas; they created mood boards for each location. The NPCs also converse in different languages.", "For the gameplay and animations, the team redid a lot of the work from previous games, wanting Grand Theft Auto IV to \"feel next-generation\". The role-playing elements from San Andreas were removed fairly early in development, partly due to the animation work it would have required, and because consistently needing to visit the gym felt antithetical to Niko's motivations. The game's targeting system was one of the first focuses of development due to the advanced technology; the team wanted it to feel realistic without being too technical. The cover system was a \"natural addition\" to the targeting. Benzies described the multiplayer as the hardest part of the game's development. The team wanted the multiplayer to feel like an extension of the cinematic single-player experience. Dan Houser described it as \"a section of a film rather than the whole narrative\". The developers considered adding co-operative multiplayer to the main story campaign, but decided it worked better as a single-player experience.", "In August 2008, Rockstar announced that the game would be coming to Microsoft Windows on 18 November 2008 in North America and 21 November in Europe, with additional development work by Rockstar Toronto.

The Xbox 360 version of the game and its DLC were made backwards compatible with the Xbox One on 9 February 2017.", "Industry analysts found Grand Theft Auto IVs marketing much more subtle than Microsoft's marketing of Halo 3 (2007), identifying Rockstar's interest in controlling the output at all times. The game was marketed through video trailers and press demonstrations. On 29 March 2007, the debut trailer was released. It was narrated by protagonist Niko, and depicts the open world accompanied by the song \"Pruit-Igoe\" by Philip Glass, originally composed for Godfrey Reggio's 1982 documentary film Koyaanisqatsi. The trailer is credited for starting the Rickrolling meme; after the higher viewership crashed Rockstar's website, several users re-posted the trailer, but some misleadingly played the music video for Rick Astley's \"Never Gonna Give You Up\". The second trailer was released on 28 June 2007, showcasing the game's physics engine and featuring the song \"Arm in Arm (Shy Child Remix)\" by The Boggs. Dan Houser noted that the game was \"still rough\" when the first trailer was released, but that cutscenes were \"coming on board\" by the second trailer's release.", "To unveil the game's cover art, Rockstar contracted artists to paint a mural on a wall at a secluded warehouse location, showcasing the art in a video on 28 November 2007. A third trailer was released on 6 December 2007, introducing some of the game's characters, such as Roman and Michelle. The trailer features the song \"King Ring\" by Russian rap artist Seryoga, which Rockstar felt captured the \"melting pot mentality\" of Liberty City. Dan Houser wanted the third trailer to capture the \"visceral qualities\" of the game, but focus less on the story, as the first two trailers had done. On 8 February 2008, five teaser trailers for the game were released, each showcasing a particular character or service within the game. Similar teaser trailers were later released in pairs on 21 February, 7 March, and 11 April. Another trailer, released on 27 March 2008, showcases some scenes from the game, such as a bank robbery and police chase.

There was just no impetus to do that then.

Unlike later games in the series, and indeed many earlier influences, the first two GTA games were 2D. In 1998, DMA moved many of these design concepts into a 3D world, with Body Harvest, a Nintendo 64 game developed by DMA Design (which eventually became Rockstar North when it was acquired by Rockstar Games). This title featured an open world with nonlinear missions and side-quests, as well as the ability to commandeer and drive a variety of vehicles.

The development on  the game was led by Rockstar Vancouver at first, but later evolved into a project spanning all Rockstar Games studio, foremost Rockstar Vancouver, London, Toronto, and New England. In January 2010, an open letter written by wives of Rockstar San Diego employees, which claimed that their husbands were regularly working overtime, as well as that the studio was suffering heavy mismanagement from higher-ups, sparked controversy and criticism directed at Rockstar San Diego and Rockstar Games. This letter was echoed by multiple people who had quit their jobs at various Rockstar Games studios, including Rockstar Vancouver, where such mismanagement was said to have caused Max Payne 3 missing of the 2009 release window. Some sources stated that Bully was developed under similar circumstances. By November 2011, Rockstar Games' creative director, Dan Houser, anticipated Max Payne 3 to release by 2012, and in January 2012, Rockstar Games announced the final release date of May 2012.
