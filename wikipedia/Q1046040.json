The book was translated into English by James Redhouse in 1874. It is the first of three diaries written by Naser al-Din Shah, who was King of Persia from 1848 until 1896, corresponding to his three tours through Europe respectively in 1873, 1878 and 1889. In the 1873 diary, Naser al-Din Shah relates his travel departing from Tehran and he describes his travel through the countries of Russia, Prussia, Germany, Belgium, England, France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Turkey and Georgia. The book has been criticized for its long and very detailed descriptions.", "The Diary of H.M. the Shah of Persia during his tour through Europe in A.D. 1873 was published in Persia in 1874 under its original Farsi name Ruznamaj-i safari-i Farangistan. After the Persian publication of the diary, the Shah sent the book to the European kings and ambassadors. The British government directly decided to translate it into English by Sir James Redhouse, a renowned British linguist (in 1874). Abbreviated version of the English translations of the diary have also been published. Besides, the diary has been translated in German in 1874, and later, in 1998, in French.  The diary thus became well-known in Britain and abroad. However, the German translation proved to be a fake one, written by the German novelist Michael Klapp.", "In the translation preface of the English translation, Sir James Redhouse states that \u201cOn the whole, a more interesting book of the kind can hardly be imagined\u201d. The diary is indeed a significant publication, relating the travel of the first Persian monarch who ever traveled to Europe. Besides, at that time, it was relatively uncommon that a king directly addressed his subjects in a personal account of his travel and that he described how he had been received by foreign monarchs. The fact that the diary has been communicated verbatim before the European countries which had lately received the Shah, was also rather unusual. Accordingly, the Diary of H.M the Shah of Persia is a substantial and compelling piece of work.", "The translation of the book by James Redhouse is based on a highly censored version of the diary of the Shah. Less censored versions have been published in the 1990s in Persia. However, these versions have not been translated into English or any European language. These uncensored versions contain many passages that are not part of the book published by the Qajar court in 1874, such as very personal or critical comments about European royalty, descriptions of women, sexual encounters, etc."]}, {"page": "Redhouse, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Redhouse"]}, {"page": "J.W.
