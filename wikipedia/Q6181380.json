The journal was a participant in introducing French post-structural theory on the English-speaking academic scene. According to The Art Story, Krauss used the journal \"as a way to publish essays on her emergent ideas on post-structuralist art theory, Deconstructionist theory, psychoanalysis, postmodernism and feminism\".
