In 1919 he was appointed Director of Music at Tonbridge School in Kent, returning to Oxford in 1924 to teach at Exeter College.  During this period he composed several choral-orchestral works including Forty Singing Seamen (1925), Master Mariners (1927) and The Ballad of Hampstead Heath (1927). He went to Australia in 1930 and spent over two years travelling across the country.  This prompted him to write his book Cobbers (1934) which the Australian Dictionary of Biography describes as \"still the most perceptive and captivating characterization of Australia and its people ever written by a visitor\".
