In 1919 he was appointed Director of Music at Tonbridge School in Kent, returning to Oxford in 1924 to teach at Exeter College.  During this period he composed several choral-orchestral works including Forty Singing Seamen (1925), Master Mariners (1927) and The Ballad of Hampstead Heath (1927). He went to Australia in 1930 and spent over two years travelling across the country.  This prompted him to write his book Cobbers (1934) which the Australian Dictionary of Biography describes as \"still the most perceptive and captivating characterization of Australia and its people ever written by a visitor\".  He continued to compose and wrote several other books, including an autobiography, True Thomas (1936), before his death of a heart attack in 1950.\nMiss St Osyth Mahala Eustace-Smith(1886 - 1970) of Wormingford married Thomas Wood in 1924 at Wormingford Church.\nBefore her marriage, on 7 June 1918 \"The London Gazette\" reported St Osyth receiving an OBE for her work as \"Hon Secretary, Essex Local War Pensions Committee\". \nAfter their marriage the new Mrs St Osyth Wood moved into Parsonage Hall, Bures and became great benefactor to the local community.\nShe died at Wasperton, Warwickshire aged 84 years.\nWood wrote a rousing school song for Barrow Grammar School entitled 'Outward Bound'.\nHere are the lyrics, also written by Thomas Wood:\nOUTWARD BOUND\nA song for the Grammar School, Barrow-in-Furness\nWords and Music by Thomas Wood (at the school 1905-1907)\nAutumn gold and winter weather\nSummer dew and bluebell spring\nDays afoot in Furness heather\nThese I knew, These were mine\nThese are part of me till I Perish\nCHORUS\nWestaway, the seas lie open\nEastaway, the sun rides high\nOutward bound in morning glory\nFree and ready, here am I\nFriends to share in games and laughter\nSongs at dusk and books at noon\nWarnings that will tell hereafter\nThese you gave- You, my school\nKnowing I shall prove myself Worthy\nCHORUS\nHarbour lights and clustered shipping\nClouds above the wheeling gulls\nFlags aloft and ensigns dipping\nYear by year, Showed the way\nShaped the course that I am now Making\nCHORUS\nTime will set the changes ringing\nThose to come must have their day\nMine's at hand to claim me, bringing\nWork to do, Risks to face\nWorlds to conquer and the hour's Striking!\nCHORUS", "link_mentions": {}}}
