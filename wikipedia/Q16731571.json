Professor of literature Marjorie Housepian Dobkin's detailed 1970 study, Smyrna 1922, concluded that the Turkish army systematically burned the city and killed Christian Greek and Armenian inhabitants. Her work is based on extensive eyewitness testimony from survivors, Allied troops sent to Smyrna during the evacuation, foreign diplomats, relief workers, and Turkish eyewitnesses. A study by historian Niall Ferguson comes to the same conclusion. Historian Richard Clogg categorically states that the fire was started by the Turks following their capture of the city. In his book Paradise Lost: Smyrna 1922, Giles Milton addresses the issue of the Smyrna Fire through original material (interviews, unpublished letters, and diaries) from the Levantine families of Smyrna, who were mainly of British origin.Milton, Paradise Lost, pp. xx. The conclusion of the author is that it was Turkish soldiers and officers who set the fire, most probably acting under direct orders. British scholar Michael Llewellyn-Smith, writing on the Greek administration in Asia Minor, also concluded that the fire was \"probably lit\" by the Turks as indicated by what he called \"what evidence there is.\""]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Greece", "response": ["*1996\u20131999: Sir Michael Llewellyn-Smith"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Poland", "response": ["*1991\u20131996: Sir Michael Llewellyn-Smith"]}, {"page": "Goudi coup", "response": ["Greece had been in economic crisis for decades. Public debt (owed above all to the Great Powers) dating back to the War of Independence reached new heights in the 1890s. At that point the government of Charilaos Trikoupis recognised that the country was bankrupt by deciding to lower the public debt to 30% of its value, which angered the creditors, particularly the European powers. At the same time, export of the Zante currant entered a crisis. A new phenomenon then began: emigration of the working population.A. Vacalopoulos, p. 196-197. The number of emigrants (especially to the United States) went from 1,108 in 1890 to 39,135 in 1910 (of 2.8 million inhabitants); significantly, remittances from America and Egypt fell amid economic slowdown in 1908. Economic growth was too slow for the workers and farmers who left to seek work elsewhere. Until that time, only highlanders and landless island dwellers had left. However, this economic growth did lead to the creation, as elsewhere in Europe in the same period, of a middle class born out of industrial development, of growth in the number of bureaucrats (linked to political clientelism) and to an urban explosion. In the mid-1900s, this middle class could not understand why the country was prosperous while the state's finances were in such poor shape. Politicians, also dissatisfied with government policy, reacted as well. In 1906, a group of youngish radicals nicknamed the \"Japanese Group\" (\u039f\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2 \u0399\u03b1\u03c0\u03ce\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd), in reference to the dynamism of the Meiji period,Or their aggressive tactics in parliament (calling to mind the Japanese army\u2019s performance in the recent Russo-Japanese War).
