Telegram has been described as \"effectively a completely new album\". Author Mark Pytlik writes, \"Promises of a Post remix album had been circulating since the release of \"Army of Me\" in April 1995. To compensate, Bj\u00f6rk announced the release of a string of 12\u2033 remixes beginning in June, limited to only 1,000 copies each. Producers and musicians featured on Telegram include: Dillinja, Eumir Deodato, LFO, and Graham Massey, among others; Bj\u00f6rk only remixed \"You've Been Flirting Again\" herself. The album also contains a new composition, \"My Spine\", a collaboration with British percussionist Evelyn Glennie. According to CMJ New Music Monthly, musically the album contains \"a real and surprising taste for recent trends in dance music\". Regarding the release, Bj\u00f6rk said: \"It's like the core of Post. That's why it's funny to call it a remix album, it's like the opposite. [...] Telegram is more stark, naked. Not trying to make it pretty or peaceable for the ear. Just a record I would buy myself\". Bj\u00f6rk also declared that the release of Telegram meant the end of an era consisting of Debut and Post. The compilation was well received by music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, \"Telegram works as an excellent introduction to techno for alternative pop fans unsure of where to begin exploring.\" Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly felt the music of Telegram was \"actually better than Post\", describing the tracks as, \"well-considered reworkings\". The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three and a half stars, and stated it, \"shed new light on the songs\". Telegram spent five weeks on the US Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 66. In the UK, it peaked at number 59, spending two weeks on the albums chart."]}, {"page": "Dillinger (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Dillinja (born 1974), reggae/drum and bass music producer"]}, {"page": "Dreamland Margate", "response": ["Dillinja,"]}, {"page": "Arcon 2", "response": ["Arcon 2 or Leon Mar, real name Noel Ram, is a musician best known for his alternately jazzy and uplifting drum'n'bass and extreme, focused darkcore.

Broadrick also recorded the second Final full-length that was released on Rawkus Records. In 1997, Godflesh released the electronic remix record Love and Hate in Dub. \"What Kevin and I were doing with Techno Animal then began to rub off on Godflesh, and vice versa\", Broadrick says. From 1997 to 1999, Martin and Broadrick released two Techno Animal compilations, Versus Reality and Radio Hades, a split album with Porter Ricks. They also start a new project titled Curse of the Golden Vampire with Alec Empire. Broadrick also had recorded tracks as JK Flesh during this time but they were released in 2009 in the compilation album From Hell. He turned down offers to join both Faith No More and Danzig.
