Before his first-class career, he had played Minor Counties cricket for Norfolk (1937\u20131939), and after his first-class retirement he returned to the Minor Counties, this time playing for Cumberland (1960\u20131962). Whilst at Cumberland, he was also professional for Workington Cricket Club.He captained Lancashire to a win over Leicestershire at Old Trafford in 1956 in a match in which his team did not lose a single wicket, the first time this had happened in a first-class match. Leicestershire were bowled out for 108 and 122, and Lancashire (166 for 0 declared and 66 for 0) won by ten wickets. His highest score was 167 not out (followed by 84 in the second innings) for Lancashire against Nottinghamshire in 1954.Edrich's three brothers, Brian, Eric and Bill and also his cousin, John Edrich, all played first-class cricket. Though, unlike his brother Bill and cousin John, Geoff Edrich never played for England, he toured India in 1953/54 with a Commonwealth XI, scoring 641 runs at an average of 40.06 and playing in three of the \"Unofficial Tests\".Edrich joined the Royal Norfolk Regiment and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Singapore. He survived three years' captivity in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, during the Second World War, including a stint on the infamous Burma Railway. After his playing career he became the groundsman and coach at Cheltenham College.He died on 2 January 2004, aged 85.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Edrich", "response": ["John Hugh Edrich,  (21 June 1937 \u2013 23 December 2020) was an English first-class cricketer who, during a career that ran from 1956 to 1978, was considered one of the best batsmen of his generation. Born in Blofield, Norfolk, Edrich came from a cricketing family, his four cousins, Eric Edrich, Bill Edrich, Geoff Edrich and Brian Edrich, all having played first-class cricket.

They lost only once (to Somerset) but drew ten and tied one. They were well served by their openers Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place who both scored more than 2,000 runs in all first-class matches, Washbrook playing in all five Tests and Place being selected for the West Indies tour. There were problems in the middle order where only Geoff Edrich performed consistently well, but the two Test all-rounders, Jack Ikin and captain Ken Cranston scored over 1,000 runs. Lancashire's outstanding bowler was paceman Dick Pollard who finished the season strongly after an indifferent early phase and took 144 wickets in all matches. Slow left armer William Roberts bowled steadily and took 74 championship wickets but Playfair remarked that he was short of Test class. As with the batting, the all-rounders Cranston and Ikin shored up the bowling with 56 and 48 championship wickets respectively. Looking to the future, Lancashire made a \"find\" in wicketkeeper Alfred Barlow and there were good reports of Alan Wharton who became a Lancashire stalwart for many seasons. Batsman Barry Howard played some good innings in his debut season and, along with Cranston, was awarded his county cap. Other players included future county captain Nigel Howard, Tom Brierley, Phil King in his final season, future Test umpire Eddie Phillipson, Eric Price, and Gordon Garlick who joined Northamptonshire in 1948.Playfair, pp. 87\u201388."]}, {"page": "Ralph Alderson", "response": ["Alderson played his first and only County Championship match for Lancashire against Kent the following year, making a half-century in the first innings with backup from team-mate Geoff Edrich.
