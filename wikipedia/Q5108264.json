The home side took an early lead after two minutes when Chris Thompson scored from around .  Wigan doubled their lead after 15 minutes when Swindon's goalkeeper Fraser Digby dropped a free kick, allowing Bobby Campbell to put the loose ball into the Swindon goal.  In the second half, Digby saved from Paul Jewell and Swindon started to dominate.  Wigan's goalkeeper Roy Tunks dived at the feet of Jimmy Quinn to deny a goalscoring chance, but the ball fell to Dave Bamber, who scored.  In the 80th minute, Quinn equalised with a firm header from a Steve Berry free kick.  With two minutes remaining, Swindon's Mark Jones crossed from the right and Peter Coyne scored with a header, making the final score 3\u20132. The return leg took place at the County Ground three days later.  As the match ended in a 0\u20130 draw, Swindon progressed to the final with a 3\u20132 aggregate score."]}]}}
