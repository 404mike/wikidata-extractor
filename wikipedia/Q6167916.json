Armstrong in her Ph.D. thesis proposed a classification featuring 40 species, subspecies and microspecies. An introduction to her work was later published in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society as part of a series which was not forthcoming. However, her classification formed the basis of that adopted by Sell and Murrell in their Flora of Great Britain and Ireland, published in 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jayne", "response": ["*Jayne V.
