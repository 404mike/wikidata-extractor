As he had been hated by convicts, there were rumours that escaped convicts living in the bush had attacked him, but there is no evidence of this.\nBorn in East Renton, Berwickshire, Scotland, he was the youngest son of a Scottish landowner and farmer, Abraham Logan and Janet Johnstown. He was baptised at Coldingham, Berwickshire on 15 November 1791.Logan had a distinguished military career. He was known as a strict commandant of the penal colony to the point of cruelty. Logan made significant explorations of what was to become known as South East Queensland. He discovered the area which became Ipswich, Queensland and some consider him to be the founder of Queensland.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brisbane River", "response": ["In the same year of 1823, the river was named after Sir Thomas Brisbane, the then Governor of New South Wales. Upon the establishment of a local settlement in 1824, other explorers such as Allan Cunningham, Patrick Logan and Major Edmund Lockyer made expeditions and surveys further upstream, and, in May 1825, the Moreton Bay penal colony at Redcliffe under the command of Heny Miller relocated to North Quay."]}, {"page": "Lamington National Park", "response": ["Captain Patrick Logan and Allan Cunningham were the first European explorers in the area.  The timber cutters soon followed, including the Lahey family who owned one of Queensland's largest timber mills at the time. In 1863 a survey of the Queensland/New South Wales border was conducted.  The task was carried out by Francis Edward Roberts and Isaiah Rowland, both surveyors, who had to define the border along the highest points in dense rainforest where there were very few clear lines of sight."]}, {"page": "Mount Barney National Park", "response": ["Nearby Mount Maroon is popular for rockclimbing. The first known climb to the summit of Mt Barney by a European was completed in 1828 by Captain Patrick Logan, by one of the hardest and most spectacular ridges on the mountain, named in his honour.

He developed a substantial settlement of brick and stone buildings, complete with school and hospital. He formed additional outstations and made several important journeys of exploration. Logan became infamous for his extreme use of the cat o' nine tails on convicts. The maximum allowed limit of lashes was 50; however, Logan regularly applied sentences of 150 lashes."]}, {"page": "Allan Cunningham (botanist)", "response": ["Cunningham returned to the Moreton Bay penal colony in 1828, setting off from Brisbane with Patrick Logan, Charles Fraser and five men to find Mount Warning and to establish the route to Cunningham's Gap which he did, on 24 July. The peaks on either side of the gap were also named, Mount Cordeaux and Mount Mitchell. After exploring the McPherson Range area, Cunningham travelled on the south side of the Gap whereas the highway today runs further north, through the gap, from the small township of Aratula. Spicer's Gap which runs parallel to Cunningham's Gap was actually the pass first identified by Cunningham in 1827. After its rediscovery by Henry Alphen in 1847, Spicer's Gap was used as a stagecoach route. In 1829, Cunningham explored the Brisbane River."]}, {"page": "Ipswich, Queensland", "response": ["Prior to the arrival of European settlers, what is now called Ipswich was home to many indigenous language groups, including the Warpai tribe,Tom Petrie's Reminiscences of Early Queensland.

Its motorway network is extensive: in the city's north-east, the Logan Motorway joins the Pacific Motorway, while the Mount Lindesay Highway and Sydney\u2013Brisbane rail corridor cross the city along a roughly central north-south axis.

He named the country Darling, in honour of the Governor. The Governor renamed the river after Logan.", "The city was named after Captain Patrick Logan, one of the founders of the Moreton Bay convict settlement.
