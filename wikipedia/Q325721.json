As he had been hated by convicts, there were rumours that escaped convicts living in the bush had attacked him, but there is no evidence of this.\nBorn in East Renton, Berwickshire, Scotland, he was the youngest son of a Scottish landowner and farmer, Abraham Logan and Janet Johnstown. He was baptised at Coldingham, Berwickshire on 15 November 1791.Logan had a distinguished military career. He was known as a strict commandant of the penal colony to the point of cruelty. Logan made significant explorations of what was to become known as South East Queensland. He discovered the area which became Ipswich, Queensland and some consider him to be the founder of Queensland.", "link_mentions": {}}}
